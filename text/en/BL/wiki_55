<text>Scottish folk music (also Scottish traditional music) is a genre of folk music that uses forms that are identified as part of the Scottish musical tradition. There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland during the late Middle Ages, but the only song with a melody to survive from this period is the &quot;Pleugh Song&quot;. After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings. The first clear reference to the use of the Highland bagpipes mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmons, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands. Well-known musicians included the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson. This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Niel and his son Nathaniel Gow. There is evidence of ballads from this period. Some may date back to the late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century. They remained an oral tradition until they were collected as folk songs in the eighteenth century.

The earliest printed collection of secular music comes from the seventeenth century. Collection began to gain momentum in the early eighteenth century and, as the Kirk&#x27;s opposition to music waned, there was a flood of publications including Allan Ramsay&#x27;s verse compendium &quot;The Tea Table Miscellany&quot; (1723) and &quot;The Scots Musical Museum&quot; (1787 to 1803) by James Johnson and Robert Burns. From the late nineteenth century there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent. In Scotland collectors included the Reverend James Duncan and Gavin Greig. Major performers included James Scott Skinner. This revival began to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland, with composers such as Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace, Learmont Drysdale, Hamish MacCunn and John McEwen.

After World War II, traditional music in Scotland was marginalised, but remained a living tradition. This was changed by individuals including Alan Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy, through collecting, publications, recordings and radio programmes. Traditional singers that they popularised included John Strachan, Jimmy MacBeath, Jeannie Robertson and Flora MacNeil. In the 1960s there was a flourishing folk club culture and Ewan MacColl emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain. The clubs hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall, Jimmie Macgregor, The Corries and the Ian Campbell Folk Group. There was also a strand of popular Scottish music that benefited from the arrival of radio and television, which relied on images of Scottishness derived from tartanry and stereotypes employed in music hall and variety, exemplified by the TV programme &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; which ran from 1958 to 1967, hosted by Andy Stewart and starring Moira Anderson and Kenneth McKeller. The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davy Graham and Bert Jansch. Others totally abandoned the traditional element including Donovan and the Incredible String Band, who have been seen as developing psychedelic folk. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included Ossian, Silly Wizard, The Boys of the Lough, Natural Acoustic Band, Battlefield Band, The Clutha, and The Whistlebinkies.

Celtic rock developed as a variant of British folk rock by Scottish groups including the JSD Band and Spencer&#x27;s Feat.

Five Hand Reel, who combined Irish and Scottish personnel, emerged as the most successful exponents of the style. From the late 1970s the attendance at, and the number of, folk clubs began to decrease, as new musical and social trends began to dominate. However, in Scotland the circuit of ceilidhs and festivals helped prop up traditional music. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s that emerged from this dance band circuit were Runrig and Capercaillie. A by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. From the United States this includes Scottish bands Seven Nations, Prydein and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West.

==Development==

There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland in the Late Middle Ages. This includes the long list of songs given in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; (1549). Many of the poems of this period were also originally songs, but for none has a notation of their music survived. Melodies have survived separately in the post-Reformation publication of &quot;The Gude and Godlie Ballatis&quot; (1567), which were spiritual satires on popular songs, adapted and published by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. The only song with a melody to survive from this period is the &quot;Pleugh Song&quot;. After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played.

The first clear reference to the use of the Highland bagpipes is from a French history, which mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. George Buchanan claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his &quot;A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot; (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone. Well-known musicians included the fiddler Pattie Birnie (c. 1635–1721) and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620). This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Niel (1727–1807) and his son Nathaniel Gow (1763–1831), who, along with a large number of anonymous musicians, composed hundreds of fiddle tunes and variations.

There is evidence of ballads from this period. Some may date back to the late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; and &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;, but for which there is no evidence until the eighteenth century. Scottish ballads are distinct, showing some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as the fairies in the Scottish ballad &quot;Tam Lin&quot;. They remained an oral tradition until increased interest in folk songs in the eighteenth century led collectors such as Bishop Thomas Percy to publish volumes of popular ballads.

==Early song collection==

In Scotland the earliest printed collection of secular music was by publisher John Forbes, produced in Aberdeen in 1662 as &quot;Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols&quot;. It was printed three times in the next twenty years, and contained seventy-seven songs, of which twenty-five were of Scottish origin. Eighteenth century publications included John Playford&#x27;s &quot;Collection of original Scotch-tunes, (full of the highland humours) for the violin&quot; (1700), Margaret Sinkler&#x27;s &quot;Music Book&quot; (1710), James Watson&#x27;s &quot;Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scots Poems both Ancient and Modern&quot; 1711. The oppression of secular music and dancing by the Kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 and the level of musical activity was reflected in a flood of musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay&#x27;s verse compendium &quot;The Tea Table Miscellany&quot; (1723), William Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus Caledonius: or, A collection of Scots songs&quot; (1733), James Oswald&#x27;s &quot;The Caledonian Pocket Companion&quot; (1751), and David Herd&#x27;s &quot;Ancient and modern Scottish songs, heroic ballads, etc.: collected from memory, tradition and ancient authors&quot; (1776). These were drawn on for the most influential collection, &quot;The Scots Musical Museum&quot; published in six volumes from 1787 to 1803 by James Johnson and Robert Burns, which also included new words by Burns. The &quot;Select Scottish Airs&quot; collected by George Thomson and published between 1799 and 1818 included contributions from Burns and Walter Scott. Among Scott&#x27;s early works was the influential collection of ballads &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; (1802–03).

==Revivals==
===First revival===

From the late nineteenth century there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent. Harvard professor Francis James Child&#x27;s (1825–96) eight-volume collection &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1882–92) has been the most influential on defining the repertoire of subsequent performers, and the English music teacher Cecil Sharp was probably the most important in understanding of the nature of folk song. In Scotland, collectors included the Reverend James Duncan (1848–1917) and Gavin Greig (1856–1914), who collected over 1,000 songs, mainly from Aberdeenshire. The tradition continued with figures including James Scott Skinner (1843–1927), known as the &quot;Strathspey King&quot;, who played the fiddle in venues ranging from the local functions in his native Banchory, to urban centres of the south and at Balmoral. In 1923 the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society was founded in an attempt to preserve traditional Scottish dances that were threatened by the introduction of the continental ballroom dances such as the waltz or quadrilles. The accordion also began to be a central instrument at Highland balls and dances.

This revival began to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland. Major composers included Alexander Mackenzie (1847–1935), William Wallace (1860–1940), Learmont Drysdale (1866–1909), Hamish MacCunn (1868–1916) and John McEwen (1868–1948). Mackenzie, who studied in Germany and Italy and mixed Scottish themes with German Romanticism, is best known for his three &quot;Scottish Rhapsodies&quot; (1879–80, 1911), &quot;Pibroch&quot; for violin and orchestra (1889) and the &quot;Scottish Concerto&quot; for piano (1897), all involving Scottish themes and folk melodies. Wallace&#x27;s work included an overture, &quot;In Praise of Scottish Poesie&quot; (1894). Drysdale&#x27;s work often dealt with Scottish themes, including the overture &quot;Tam O’ Shanter&quot; (1890), the cantata &quot;The Kelpie&quot; (1891). MacCunn&#x27;s overture &quot;The Land of the Mountain and the Flood&quot; (1887), his &quot;Six Scotch Dances&quot; (1896), his operas &quot;Jeanie Deans&quot; (1894) and &quot;Dairmid&quot; (1897) and choral works on Scottish subjects have been described by I. G. C. Hutchison as the musical equivalent of the Scots Baronial castles of Abbotsford and Balmoral. Similarly, McEwen&#x27;s &quot;Pibroch&quot; (1889), &quot;Border Ballads&quot; (1908) and &quot;Solway Symphony&quot; (1911) incorporated traditional Scottish folk melodies.

===Second revival===
After World War II, traditional music in Scotland was marginalised, but, unlike in England, it remained a much stronger force, with the Céilidh house still present in rural communities until the early 1950s and traditional material still performed by the older generation, even if the younger generation tended to prefer modern styles of music. This decline was changed by the actions of individuals such as American musicologist Alan Lomax, who collected numerous songs in Scotland that were issued by Columbia Records around 1955. Radio broadcasts by Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy (1922–2006) were also important in raising awareness of the tradition, particularly Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;As I Roved Out&quot;, which was largely based around Scottish and Irish music. The School of Scottish Studies was founded at University of Edinburgh in 1951, with Henderson as a research fellow and a collection of songs begun by Calum Maclean (1915–1960). Acts that were popularised included John Strachan (1875–1958), Jimmy MacBeath (1894–1972), Jeannie Robertson (1908–1975) and Flora MacNeil (1928–2015). A number of festivals also popularised the music, such as Edinburgh People&#x27;s Festival (1951–1953) and Aberdeen Folk Festival (1963–). In the 1960s there was a flourishing folk club culture. The first folk club was founded in London by Ewan MacColl (1915–1989), who emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain, recording influential records such as &quot;Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1956). Scottish folk clubs were less dogmatic than their English counterparts which rapidly moved to an all English folk song policy, and they continued to encourage a mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and American material. Early on they hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall (1936–1998), Jimmie Macgregor (born 1930) and The Corries. A number of these new performers, including the Ian Campbell Folk Group, emerged from the skiffle movement.

There was also a strand of popular Scottish music that benefited from the arrival of radio and television, which relied on images of Scottishness derived from tartanry and stereotypes employed in music hall and variety. Proponents included Andy Stewart (1933–1993), whose weekly programme &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; ran in Scotland from 1958 to 1967. Frequent guests included Moira Anderson (born 1938) and Kenneth McKeller (1927–2010), who enjoyed their own programmes. The programmes and their music were immensely popular, although their version of Scottish music and identity was despised by many modernists.

The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davy Graham and Bert Jansch. This led in part to British progressive folk music, which attempted to elevate folk music through greater musicianship, or compositional and arrangement skills. Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch who became a member of the band Pentangle in 1967. Others largely abandoned the traditional element of their music. Particularly important were Donovan (who was most influenced by emerging progressive folk musicians in America such as Bob Dylan) and the Incredible String Band, who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences including medieval and Eastern music into their compositions, leading to the development of psychedelic folk, which had a considerable impact on progressive and psychedelic rock. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included Ossian and Silly Wizard. The Boys of the Lough and Battlefield Band, emerged from the flourishing Glasgow folk scene. Also from this scene were the highly influential The Clutha, whose line up, with two fiddlers, was later augmented by the piper Jimmy Anderson, and the Whistlebinkies, who pursued a strongly instrumental format, relying on traditional instruments, including a Clàrsach (Celtic harp). Many of these groups played largely music originating from the Lowlands, while later, more successful bands tended to favor the Gaelic sounds of the Highlands. While fairly popular within folk circles, none of these groups achieved the success of Irish groups such as The Chieftains and The Dubliners. Some of these bands produced noted solo artists, including Andy M. Stewart of Silly Wizard, Brian McNeill of Battlefield Band, and Dougie MacLean of the Tannahill Weavers. MacLean is perhaps the best known of these, having written &quot;Caledonia&quot;, one of Scotland&#x27;s most beloved songs.

Though perhaps not as popular as some of their Celtic fusion counterparts, traditional Scottish artists are still making music. These include Hebridean singer Julie Fowlis, &#x27;Gaelic supergroup&#x27; Dàimh, and Lau. Old Blind Dogs have also found success singing in the Doric Scots dialect of their native Aberdeenshire. Albannach has gained recognition for their distinctive combination of pipes and drums.

===Celtic rock===

Celtic rock developed as a variant of British folk rock, playing traditional Scottish folk music with rock instrumentation, developed by Fairport Convention and its members from 1969. Donovan used the term &quot;Celtic rock&quot; to describe the folk rock he created for his &quot;Open Road&quot; album in 1970, featured a song with &quot;Celtic rock&quot; as its title. The adoption of British folk rock heavily influenced by Scottish traditional music produced groups including the JSD Band The Natural Acoustic Band (1970) and Spencer&#x27;s Feat. Out of the wreckage of the latter in 1974, guitarist Dick Gaughan formed probably the most successful band in this genre Five Hand Reel, who combined Irish and Scottish personnel, before he embarked on an influential solo career.

From the late 1970s the attendance at, and number of, folk clubs began to decrease, as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. However, in Scotland the circuit of cèilidhs and festivals helped prop up traditional music. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s emerged from this dance band circuit. From 1978, when they began to release original albums, Runrig produced highly polished Scottish folk rock, including the first commercially successful album with the all Gaelic &quot;Play Gaelic&quot; in 1978. From the 1980s Capercaillie combined Scottish folk music, electric instruments and haunting vocals to considerable success. While bagpipes had become an essential element in Scottish folk bands they were much rarer in folk rock outfits, but were successfully integrated into their sound by Wolfstone from 1989, who focused on a combination of highland music and rock. More recently, bands such as Mànran and Tide Lines have also focused on a combination of Celtic music and pop-rock. Additionally, groups such as Shooglenifty and Peatbog Faeries mixed traditional highland music with more modern sounds, such as dubstep rhythms, creating a genre sometimes referred to as &quot;Acid Croft&quot;. Niteworks inspired the two aforementioned bands and the electronic sampling of Martyn Bennett have further developed Celtic electronic music which has been described as both Gaelictronica and Celtictronica.

Successful Scottish stadium rock acts such as Simple Minds from Glasgow and Big Country from Dunfermline incorporated traditional Celtic sounds onto many of their songs. The former based their hit &quot;Belfast Child&quot; around the traditional Irish song &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; and incorporated accordion into their line-up, while the latter&#x27;s guitar and drum sounds on their early albums were heavily influenced by Scottish pipe bands, particularly on songs such as &quot;In a Big Country&quot; and &quot;Fields of Fire&quot;. Big Country also covered Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Killiecrankie&quot;.

One by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. While it seems young musicians from these communities usually chose between their folk culture and mainstream forms of music such as rock or pop, after the advent of Celtic punk relatively large numbers of bands began to emerge styling themselves as Celtic rock. This is particularly noticeable in the United States and Canada, where there are large communities descended from Irish and Scottish immigrants. From the U.S. this includes Seven Nations, Prydein and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West. These groups were influenced by American forms of music, some containing members with no Celtic ancestry and commonly singing in English.

<text>Joel Minnick Longenecker (January 12, 1847 – September 19, 1906) was an American farmer, soldier, lawyer, State&#x27;s Attorney, judge, gubernatorial candidate, and Department Commander of the Illinois Grand Army of the Republic. He was active in nationally prominent trials involving the Chicago Anarchists, and Irish nationalists.

Longenecker had been a farmer in Robinson, Illinois, Crawford County.. In the American Civil War, Longenecker, age 18, joined Co. F, 5th Regiment of the Illinois Cavalry as a private on December 4, 1864, in Olney, Illinois. He served for one year with no apparent distinction. 

After the war, Longenecker taught school for two terms, and – after he came of age – was elected Justice of the Peace while he was studying law at Robinson. He married Emma Florence Fitch on August 30, 1870. In 1871, Longenecker was admitted to the bar at Olney, Illinois at which time he served as City Attorney. From 1876 to 1880 he was State’s Attorney serving at Richland County, and from 1882 to 1899, tried over 35 reported decisions as State’s Attorney in Chicago, Cook County.

He was prominent in such trials as the anarchist and the infamous Irish Nationalist Dr. Patrick Henry Cronin murder case.

From 1899, Longenecker served as a Judge in Cook County.

On May 3, 1890, he was elected Department Commander of the Illinois Grand Army of the Republic. During his term as Commander, as reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Judge Joel M. Longenecker is Chairman of the General Committee and is hosting the National G.A.R. Encampment in Chicago on August 21 through September 1, 1900.&quot; Also, as the &quot;Times&quot; reported, &quot;This City is preparing for what is expected to be the greatest Grand Army Encampment in the history of the organization.&quot; Longenecker officially received President William McKinley and the Governor of Illinois at the parade review stand on Tuesday, August 28, 1900.

A bronze-medal bas-relief of Longenecker is shown in the photograph. The reverse side of the low-relief emblem reads, &quot;35th Annual Encampment, Department of Illinois, G. A. R., Peoria, Ill’s. May 14–15-16, 1901.&quot; This medallion marked the end of Judge Longenecker’s 10-year term as GAR Illinois Department Commander.

In August 1906, Judge Longenecker’s strength failed. He went to Paw Paw Lake in Berrien County, Michigan to recuperate, and on September 19, 1906, died from cirrhosis of the liver, probably due – in no small part – to excessive drinking. In his obituary, it is stated that Longenecker was second in the Republican primary race (year?) for Governor of the State of Illinois.

<text>Eve Online (stylised EVE Online) is a space-based, persistent-world massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CCP Games. Players of &quot;Eve Online&quot; can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment (PVE) and player versus player (PVP)). The game contains a total of 7,800 star systems that can be visited by players.

The game is renowned for its scale and complexity in regard to player interactions. In its single, shared game world, players engage in unscripted economic competition, warfare, and political schemes with other players. The Bloodbath of B-R5RB, a battle involving thousands of players in a single star system, took 21 hours and was recognized as one of the largest and most expensive battles in gaming history. &quot;Eve Online&quot; was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art with a video including the historical events and accomplishments of the playerbase.

&quot;Eve Online&quot; was released in North America and Europe in May 2003. It was published from May to December 2003 by Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive in North America and by Crucial Entertainment in the United Kingdom, after which CCP purchased the rights and began to self-publish via a digital distribution scheme. On January 22, 2008, it was announced that &quot;Eve Online&quot; would be distributed via Steam. On March 10, 2009, the game was again made available in boxed form in stores, released by Atari. In February 2013, &quot;Eve Online&quot; reached over 500,000 subscribers. On November 11, 2016, &quot;Eve Online&quot; added a limited free-to-play version.

==Background==
Set more than 21,000 years in the future, the background story of &quot;Eve Online&quot; explains that humanity, having used up most of Earth&#x27;s resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing the rest of the Milky Way. As on Earth, this expansion also led to competition and fighting over available resources, but everything changed with the discovery of a natural wormhole leading to an unexplored galaxy subsequently dubbed &quot;New Eden&quot;. Dozens of colonies were founded, and a structure, a gate of sorts (which bears the inscription &quot;EVE&quot; on the New Eden side), was built to stabilize the wormhole that linked the colonies of New Eden with the rest of human civilization. However, when the wormhole unexpectedly collapsed, it destroyed the gate as well as the connection between the colonies of New Eden and the Milky Way. Cut off from the rest of humanity and supplies from Earth, the colonies of New Eden were left starving and disconnected from one another; many died out entirely. Over the millennia the descendants of the surviving colonists managed to rebuild their own societies, but by this time the memories and knowledge of humanity&#x27;s origins, of Earth and the Milky Way galaxy, as well as the history of the settling of New Eden, were lost; what little information that survived transmission over the generations was misunderstood, lost in translation, or consigned to mythology. Five major distinct societies rose to prominence from the surviving colonies, all growing into interstellar spaceflight-capable civilizations. The states based around these societies make up the five major empires in &quot;Eve Online&quot;: the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar Republic, and the Jove Empire.

===Races===

The Amarr, a militantly theocratic empire, was the first of the playable races to rediscover faster-than-light travel. In terms of physical proximity, the space occupied by this society is physically nearest to the demolished EVE gate. Armed with this new technology and the strength of their faith in their god, the Amarr expanded their empire by conquering and enslaving several races, including the Minmatar race, who had only just begun colonizing other planets. Generations later, after the intense culture shock of encountering the Gallente Federation, and in the wake of a disastrous attempted invasion of Jovian space, many Minmatar took the opportunity to rebel and successfully overthrew their enslavers, forming their own government. However, much of their population remain enslaved by the Amarr, and some, having adopted the Amarrian religion and sided with their masters during the revolution, were released from bondage and incorporated into the Empire as commoners in the Ammatar Mandate. The free Minmatar Republic, taking as inspiration the ideals and practices of the Gallente Federation, is presently a strong military and economic power actively seeking the emancipation of their brethren and all other slaves.

The Gallente and the Caldari homeworlds are situated in the same star system. The Gallente homeworld was originally settled by descendants of the French colonists of Tau Ceti; Caldari Prime on the other hand was purchased by a multinational megacorporation that began to terraform it. The terraforming of Caldari Prime was incomplete at the time of the EVE wormhole&#x27;s collapse, hence the planet remained environmentally inhospitable for millennia. The Gallente restored themselves to a high-functioning technological society some hundred years before the Caldari, building the first lastingly democratic republic of New Eden in the form of the Gallente Federation. Originally the Caldari composed a member race within the Federation, but cultural animosity between the two peoples spiralled into a war during which the Caldari seceded from the Federation to found their own Caldari State. The war lasted 93 years, with neither nation able to overwhelm the other. The planet Caldari Prime was initially retained by the Gallente Federation during the war, and did not become part of the new Caldari State. A Caldari offensive later managed to recapture their lost homeworld, a fact which was viewed with abhorrence by the Gallente, who saw the presence of a significant Caldari fleet about the planet as a mass hostage taking. After 5 years of Caldari control over Caldari Prime, the Gallente launched their own offensive to retake the planet through the destruction of the Caldari Leviathan-Class Titan &quot;Shiigeru&quot;. They successfully destroyed &quot;Shiigeru&quot;, although the planet is now demilitarized and separated into districts split between Caldari and Gallente control.

Both the Gallente Federation and Caldari State are economy- and trade-oriented nations. However, the Gallente favor liberal economic policies, encourage individual entrepreneurship and social democracy, and maintain a progressive approach to social welfare, whereas the Caldari State is organised as a form of statist corporatocracy; the Caldari State itself is owned by and operated on behalf of a few trust-like megaconglomerates. The Gallente Federation&#x27;s official policies regarding multiculturalism and encouragement of diversity attract many immigrants to Gallente space; a third of all ethnic Minmatars reside as citizens there. As the Caldari did not share this enthusiasm for diversity with the Gallente, the Caldari State at the time of its formation found itself at a relative population deficit compared to its Gallente adversary; rather than encourage massive immigration to and diversity within the State, this population shortage was rectified by a Statewide programme of artificial reproduction, producing a generation of so-called &#x27;Tube Children&#x27; raised by the Caldari State apparatus to enlarge the labour pools available to the megacorporations that ruled the State. 

The Jovians (a non-playable race) were also descended from colonists. Unlike the other races of &quot;Eve Online&quot;, they maintained a relatively high-functioning technological society after the collapse of the EVE wormhole and did not need to spend millennia recapitulating ancient societal developments as the others did, and while the other four major races were still grounded, Jovian history saw two major periods of spacefaring imperialism. They expanded outward and eventually turned to genetic engineering in order to mold themselves into a species more suited for deep-space life and long-range interstellar exploration. Genetic experimentation and manipulation were not without their drawbacks, however: by the time period in which players enter the &quot;Eve Online&quot; universe, millennia of human genetic manipulation have rendered the Jovians barely recognizable as human; more critically, the Jovian manipulation of their genome has resulted in the eventually fatal &quot;Jovian Disease&quot;, an inherited psychological disorder which, despite the best efforts of the Jovians to reverse it, has affected every individual of the Jovian race and thus crippled their civilization. Having experienced a catastrophic population decline (the Jovian societal structure is believed to be barely maintained by their immensely-advanced technological systems), the Jovians have effectively retreated to inhabit a region of space inaccessible to outsiders.

In addition to different backgrounds and histories, the races have characteristic philosophies of starship design. Minmatar ships tend to be quite fast but fragile, and rely on their high speed and maneuverability to evade the tracking systems of heavier weapons, while using combinations of missile launchers and projectile weapons (such as artillery or autocannons - the more sophisticated kin of today&#x27;s munitions technology) to output high amounts of damage. Amarr ships are ponderous, densely armored, and pack batteries of powerful laser-based energy weaponry as well as energy neutralizers drain the power out of enemy ships. Gallente ships are sleek and designed to favor armor plating; they specialize in deploying fleets of robotic drones while mounting hybrid weapons that operate using superconducting magnets to accelerate mass toward targets at great speed (see Railgun). Finally, Caldari ships are typically poorly armored and not particularly fast but utilize powerful energy shields, and make extensive use of torpedo and/or missile launchers and hybrid weapons, favoring engagement at extreme ranges. However, there are exceptions to these general rules in each race.

==Gameplay==
Players start the game by either selecting a previously created character or by creating a new one. Each &quot;Eve Online&quot; account allows for up to three characters. When a player creates a new character, they start by choosing one of the four playable races – Amarr, Gallente, Minmatar, or Caldari. Each race is further divided into three bloodlines that give characters different pre-defined appearances, which can be finely tuned by the player.

Unlike many other MMOs, where there are numerous copies of the game universe intended to run at once (i.e., servers), &quot;Eve Online&quot; is functionally a single-universe game. There are at least four copies of the universe running: the main server &quot;Tranquility&quot;, the Chinese-based &quot;Serenity&quot;, the test server &quot;Singularity&quot; (also &quot;Sisi&quot;) which is a general, public test server, and an event server, &quot;Thunderdome&quot;, which is used for tournaments. A new test server was announced called &quot;Buckingham&quot; to replace &quot;Singularity&quot; as the main &quot;EVE Online&quot; test server while &quot;Singularity&quot; was used for &quot;Dust 514&quot;/&quot;EVE Online&quot; joint testing. As &quot;Dust 514&quot; is no longer active, &quot;Singularity&quot; is now the main test server again and &quot;Buckingham&quot; is a closed test server for the CCP developers.

===Universe===
The playing environment in &quot;Eve Online&quot; consists of more than 5000 star systems, as well as 2500 randomly accessible wormhole systems, taking place in the year 23,341. Systems are classified by their Security Status, on a decimal scale from −1.0 to 1.0. These systems are categorized into three groups, each determining the response from CONCORD (Consolidated Co-operation and Relations Command) NPC law enforcement units. Star systems classed as 0.5–1.0 security are considered &quot;high security&quot; and any unauthorized/unprovoked attack by a character on another character anywhere in the system will result in the appearance of law enforcement. These units will attack and destroy the aggressor, and are designed to reinforce in such strength that they will always win an engagement. However, CONCORD is not preventive, but punitive, meaning there is a short window between beginning an attack and getting destroyed where a player (or group of) can destroy another player&#x27;s ship. Systems classified as 0.1–0.4 are considered &quot;low security&quot;, where CONCORD law enforcement units will not destroy aggressors, but do monitor unprovoked acts of aggression and have automated sentry guns in some locations. Unprovoked attacks will flag the aggressor as a free target for other players, and attacks within sight of sentry guns will cause them to fire on the aggressor. Systems classified 0.0 to −1.0 are called &quot;zero space&quot; or &quot;null sec&quot;, and feature no law enforcement; individual systems, or groups of systems, may be controlled by player alliances, up to the creation of player-owned empires reaching across entire &quot;regions&quot; (an aggregate group of star systems). Wormhole systems are accessible only by wormholes that randomly appear and disappear, and are also lawless space, showing as −1.0. However, player-run corporations cannot claim sovereignty in wormhole systems. Star systems contain different types of celestial objects, making them more or less suitable for different kinds of operations. Typically, players find asteroid fields, planets, stations, stargates, and moons in a system. Many of the game&#x27;s most profitable income sources are found in dangerous null or low security systems, giving players incentive to engage in high-risk, high-reward activities in which they must survive the possible harassment of other players who may also enter the system.

===Combat and travel===

The game&#x27;s primary mode of play is flying space ships. Players can dock at stations, where they are safe and can use station services such as repairing, refitting, and the regional market. All space combat takes place in real time at sub-light speeds from around 100 m/s to in excess of 8000 m/s, depending on ship size and setup. While players can manually control their ships as in space combat simulators such as &quot;Wing Commander&quot; or &quot;X-Wing&quot; following the release of the Rhea expansion on December 9, 2014, most opt instead to give commands such as Orbit, Approach or Align to their flight computer, which does its best to comply. Weapon aiming, however, cannot be done manually; instead, the player locks on to an opponent and orders their weapons to fire, and the result is determined through calculations based on factors such as range, velocity, weapon tracking, and a degree of randomness.

Travel across distances longer than hundreds of kilometers is mostly done with the ship&#x27;s Warp Drive, which every ship and escape pod has. Alternatively a player may also choose to &quot;slow boat&quot; across these kind of distances, that is, traveling without warp drive. To warp, the player issues a command to warp to an object greater than 150 km away and in the same star system; after an alignment maneuver, their ship will enter warp. Warp speeds are measured in astronomical units per second and vary by ship class and fittings. A ship&#x27;s warp drive can be temporarily disabled by warp disruption weapons, which is an essential part of combat to prevent a target from escaping.

For most ships, travel between star systems is only possible by using structures called &quot;Stargates&quot;. Each stargate is linked to a partner stargate in another system; most star systems have more than two stargates, forming a network through which players travel. While players can travel to any number of destinations in individual systems, the need to use stargates to travel between systems makes them focal points for combat.

Besides using Stargates, capital ships can also utilize jump drives, which require another ship to create a &quot;Cynosural Field&quot; which the capital ship can then jump to. While this allows the capital ship to travel instantaneously, it requires a trusted second party (or an alternate account) to create the beacon. Jump drives also consume fuel (in contrast to stargates, which require nothing), drain the ship of its capacitor, leaving it nearly defenseless until it is recharged, and incur &quot;jump fatigue&quot;, which prevents the pilot from jumping for progressively longer periods of time after each consecutive jump. Titans are also capable of allowing other ships to instantaneously travel by creating temporary bridges to cynosural fields. Black Ops battleships can create similar, but undetectable, bridges capable of transporting only specific types of stealth ships such as Stealth Bombers.

Player-run corporations that claim sovereignty over two null sec systems within range of each other can also set up a jump bridge at a player owned starbase (POS) that is in orbit of a moon. Jump bridges allow instantaneous travel to the other system&#x27;s jump bridge, at the cost of using fuel (requiring supply by the owning corporation) scaled to the mass of ships that use them. This also leads to the accumulation of jump fatigue. As the aging POS systems &amp; code have been phased out of the game, a deployable structure has effectively replaced the old jump bridge. However, unlike the old POS jump bridges, it allows players to customize who may use the gate based on settings such as standings or corporation / alliance affiliation. It also does not need to be deployed in a POS, and as such is often deployed near player owned Citadel structures.

===Advancement===
Unlike other massively multiplayer online games, player characters in &quot;Eve Online&quot; advance continuously over time by training skills, a passive process that occurs in real world time so that the learning process continues even if the player is not logged in. The skill training queue allows up to 50 skills to be scheduled, with up to a 10-year total training schedule. Before the November 4, 2014 &quot;Phoebe&quot; release, the skill training queue allowed skills to be scheduled to start training only up to 24 hours in the future. Some skills require other prerequisite skills to be trained to a certain level to be trained, and some skills require more time to train than others; for example, the skill to fly a Titan-class spaceship takes 8 times as long to train as the skill to fly a frigate ship, with a significant number of prerequisite skills.

Until the Odyssey expansion, it was not possible to train more than one character per account at the same time. Odyssey introduced &quot;Dual Character Training&quot;, which allows players to expend PLEX (see accounts and subscriptions) in order to allow that account to train a second character for 30 days, equivalent to paying for a 30-day subscription on another account to train a single character. Odyssey 1.2 introduced the more generalized &quot;Multiple Character Training&quot; which allows players to expend more PLEX to activate this feature for a third character on the account.

===Economy===
The in-game economy in &quot;Eve Online&quot; is an open economy that is largely player-driven. Non-player character (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPCs. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture almost all of the ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy. The in-game currency is ISK (Interstellar Kredits), which is also the currency code of the Icelandic króna, the real-world currency of Iceland, where the &quot;Eve Online&quot; development studio is located.

The amount of money or materials in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under supply and demand. Market manipulation is possible on a large scale, particular examples being ramping and bear raids. CCP does not issue refunds on in-game purchases. Hence, there is always the risk of certain types of confidence tricks or other scams. The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas. This encourages a more even spread of players.

The game provides support for the trading of in-game resources, including graphs of item price history, with Donchian Channel and daily average price. Some player characters operate primarily as traders, generating profits through buying, selling, and transporting goods. Others operate primarily as producers, obtaining components or raw materials and transforming them, sometimes on massive scales, into useful items such as weapons, ships, ammunition, items, or various technologies in demand by other players. Some less combat-oriented players operate as miners or salvagers, collecting and processing ores used in manufacturing or collecting salvage materials to make into items, respectively. Finally, some characters operate as mercenaries or pirates, being paid primarily to be battle-ready and either to attack or defend other profitable enterprises.

Unlike some games such as &quot;Second Life&quot;, in-game currency is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as Pilot License Extension (PLEX) tokens, 500 being redeemable for 30 days of Omega time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell the items on the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers&#x27; reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to fall under the same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP prefers not place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both to the difficulty of regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.

Commentators have attempted to estimate the value of &quot;Eve Online&quot; entities in real-world currency based on the current value of PLEX. One such conversion valued a fleet-ready titan (the most powerful ship in the game) at US$7,600, though estimates vary. Generally, no player expends such amounts of real-world currency to acquire such sums of in-game wealth, opting instead to do activities in-game that net high amounts of profit.

In 2007, CCP was the first game developer to hire an economist, Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, to oversee &quot;Eve&quot;″s in-game economy. Guðmundsson was previously dean of the faculty of business and science at the University of Akureyri. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson left CCP in 2014 to the position of Rector at the University of Akureyri in July 2014.

===Griefing===

Owing to the game&#x27;s focus on freedom, consequence, and autonomy, many behaviours that are considered griefing in most MMOs are allowed in &quot;Eve&quot;. This includes stealing from other players, extortion, and causing other players to be killed by large groups of NPCs.

Only malicious, prolonged and concentrated harassment where no material gain is involved and a few other actions are considered to be illicit griefing by the game&#x27;s developers. Escaping retribution by CONCORD, the NPC space police force that punishes criminal activity in higher security solar systems, for criminal actions is also forbidden, as CONCORD is intentionally designed by game mechanics to be unstoppable.

==Ships==

Ships in &quot;Eve Online&quot; are organized into classes, from tiny frigates only a few dozen meters in length to gigantic capital ships up to 17 kilometers long. Ships fill different roles and vary in size, speed, hull strength, and firepower; smaller ships are generally faster and capable of disabling their targets, but lack the damage output necessary to destroy larger ships, while capital ships do very high amounts of damage but have difficulty striking smaller, mobile targets. Each of the four races has its own unique ship design preferences and strengths and weaknesses, although all races have ships that are meant for the same basic roles and are balanced for play against each other. This means that there is no &quot;best ship&quot; in &quot;Eve Online&quot;. According to the player&#x27;s preferred style of play, the player might want their characters to fly a ship with a huge cargo hold, one that is suited for mining, one that has a powerful array of weapons, or a ship that moves quickly through space; but the fluid, ever-changing nature of &quot;Eve Online&quot; means that no ship will be perfect at all of these tasks, nor is there any guarantee that the &quot;best ship for the job&quot; today will continue to be the best ship tomorrow.

Furthermore, unlike many online games, &quot;Eve Online&quot; does not feature racial bonuses; that is, characters of different races do not gain intrinsic advantages for flying ships designed by their own races. While a character will begin with more advanced skills in their own race&#x27;s ships, a character of another race can reach the same proficiency through training. Thus, players are encouraged to use starships that meet their preferred style of play, and the game does not provide incentives for playing as one race rather than another. However, the ships of different races receive unique bonuses to certain things.

===Classes===
Ships in &quot;Eve Online&quot; come in four size classes: 
* Small starships include: 
** Frigates – small, mobile ships good for disruption and harassment 
** Destroyers – slightly larger and more offense-oriented than frigates 
* Medium starships include: 
** Cruisers – multipurpose ships with many possible roles 
** Battlecruisers – heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers 
* The large class is made up of 
** Battleships – heavily armed and armored dedicated combat ships 
* Extra-large, or capital class, starships include: 
** Carriers – offense-oriented ships that can launch wings of fighters to attack targets at extreme range 
** Dreadnoughts – dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals 
** Force auxiliary ships – dedicated support ships exceptional at repairing other ships 
** Supercarriers – larger versions of carriers, focused more on damage to capital class ships and powerful fleet disruption capabilities 
** Titans – supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships, or have other powerful battle-affecting capabilities
===Characteristics===
Each spaceship within the &quot;Eve Online&quot; universe has a different set of characteristics, and can be fitted with different combinations of modules, subject to their fitting requirements. Ships have a wide variety of characteristics, including power grid, CPU, capacitor size and recharge rate, energy shields, armor, maximum velocity, agility, locking range, and maximum number of lockable targets. A ship&#x27;s systems also receive bonuses depending on the ship&#x27;s pilot&#x27;s levels of various skills. These bonuses usually correspond to the role the ship has been designed for, and thus vary widely. For instance, the Caldari &quot;Caracal&quot; cruiser has a bonus to the rate of fire of certain missile launcher types, while the Gallente &quot;Vexor&quot; cruiser has a bonus to the damage and hitpoints of certain types of combat drones.

One important characteristic of a ship is the slots it has available for modules. Slots and modules come in three variants—high-, mid-, and low-power. 
* High-power slot modules include weapons such as turrets and missile launchers, cloaking devices, and tractor beams and other tools for mining and salvaging. 
* Mid-power slot items include modules to improve shields or propulsion, repair hull damage, engage in electronic warfare, and &quot;tackle&quot; other ships to slow or stop movement and prevent escape. 
* Low-power slot items include armor enhancements and repair, increased cargo space, and improved speed, agility, computers, or power supply.

Ships of different sizes have different numbers and ratios of module slots.

A ship may also have two to three slots for rigs, which are modules that require no power grid or CPU, but instead require a ship resource called &quot;calibration&quot;. Installing a rig is a semi-permanent action, as a rig cannot be removed from the ship without being destroyed. Rigs come in four sizes, small, medium, large, and capital, which roughly correspond to the size of the ship, and are used to affect other aspects of the ship such as maximum speed or cargo capacity, or to augment the capabilities of other modules installed in the ship. Most rigs also incur a penalty to a certain aspect of the ship; for example, armor rigs reduce the maximum velocity of the ship.

===Tech level===
All ships in the game are also classed according to &quot;Tech level&quot;, from Tech I to Tech III. 
* Tech I (or T1) ships are general purpose, easily manufactured models that perform simple, straightforward functions in an obvious way; faction ships, which are usually very expensive and very proficient at their intended tasks, are also T1. 
* Tech II (T2) ships are based on T1 designs, but have been modified to perform specific roles using specialized technology. T2 ships are harder to manufacture and are only produced by certain corporations, and are priced well above the T1 variants. They also require significantly greater skills to fly than their T1 variants.
* Tech III (T3) strategic cruisers were introduced into &quot;Eve Online&quot; in the Apocrypha patch. These highly advanced starships are manufactured from material recovered from beyond wormholes, another new feature introduced by Apocrypha; this gives them unique qualities. Strategic cruisers are rare and expensive, and require manufacturers to have unique skillsets that allow the reverse engineering and integration of highly advanced technologies recovered from dead or dormant ancient civilizations. The T3 ships introduced by Apocrypha differ from other ships in that they are modular. Players start with a hull and then add four subsystems to it, the choice of which can dramatically change the ship&#x27;s character, giving it a different layout of module slots, different preferred weapon systems, and abilities such as being able to fit covert cloaks or ignore some warp disruption effects. The Rhea, Aegis, Tiamat, and Carnyx patches introduced four new T3 tactical destroyers. While these lack the modular nature of their strategic cruiser big brothers, they can dynamically swap between three &quot;modes&quot;, augmenting their offensive, defensive, or propulsion capabilities, respectively, as needed by the pilot, even in the midst of combat. This gives these tactical destroyers substantially superior offensive, defensive, or evasive capabilities than other lower-tech destroyers, though they can only utilize one of the three capabilities at a time.

==Players and communities==
Players have several interaction options when playing &quot;Eve Online&quot;. Every activity is possible for solo players but larger and more complicated tasks become more feasible for groups, such as pirate clans or corporations.

===Corporations and alliances===
Players can organize themselves into corporations (similar to guilds or clans in other MMOs). Corporations are run by one chief executive officer (CEO) who controls the corporation&#x27;s assets. The CEO assigns roles to corporation members such as director, accountant and personnel manager. Corporations may also band together to form alliances. Corporations and alliances come in different shapes and sizes. Some player groups write press releases about new business openings and send out IPO information to potential in-game venture capital investors. Alliances can control enough star systems that their territory can be plotted on the &quot;Eve Online&quot; game map. Alliances based in lawless space often form unofficial political power blocs with other alliances. These power blocs are typically referred to as &quot;coalitions&quot;. Unlike formally established alliances, coalitions are similar in nature to Japanese &quot;keiretsu&quot; an informal &#x27;business arrangement&#x27; in which several corporations band together to provide mutual financial, military and/or industrial support.

Corporations take up numerous business models such as mining, manufacturing or &quot;ratting&quot; (hunting NPC pirates for their bounties and loot). Corporations can levy income taxes on their members, which skim off a percentage of every member&#x27;s earnings. Many corporations offer a variety of benefits to their members, such as free or discounted ships, equipment, formal training, and organized corporate group operations.

Among the many activities that corporations can organize is piracy. Actions considered piracy generally involve breaking the in-game law, and can come in a variety of forms. Pirates may camp stargates waiting for other players to arrive, attack players operating in asteroid belts or hunt for players carrying out an NPC agent-assigned mission. Because these activities are considered to be &quot;illegal&quot; within the game mechanics, pirate characters often will have low security status and may even be branded as outlaws by CONCORD. Likewise, victims of overt piracy may retaliate without intervention from CONCORD, often via an expressed right to destroy the pirate ship (i.e., &quot;kill right&quot;). Although piracy activities are &quot;illegal&quot; within the game universe, they are not against the rules of the game, i.e., there will only be in-game retaliation and punishment for them.

Illegally attacking another player in secure space will result in a loss of security standing; CONCORD, the interstellar NPC police, will arrive shortly to destroy the aggressor&#x27;s ship. There are, however, legal ways to attack other players in high-security space.

Whole corporations and whole alliances can officially declare war on (or &quot;war-dec&quot;) other corporations or alliances for a weekly fee, permitting all members of the involved corporations or alliances to attack each other without loss of security status or the intervention of CONCORD. The weekly fee can be eliminated if the war declaration is reciprocated. War declarations will clearly flag a player&#x27;s enemies, so that players can determine who can legally attack and be attacked.

===Demographics===
: N.B.: Demographic data for this game has &quot;not&quot; been collected uniformly or regularly.
In March 2006, CCP made a deal with Optic Communications to start working on bringing &quot;Eve Online&quot; to the Chinese gaming audience. Closed alpha testing was held on a small cluster for some time, with about 3,000 players chosen from an initial pool of 50,000. The Chinese open beta test began on June 13, 2006, and proved to be very popular, gaining numbers comparable to &quot;Eve Online&quot;&#x27;s main server cluster. In order to avoid the shock of quickly adding thousands of new players to the current server (Tranquility), CCP Games decided to launch &quot;Eve&quot; in China on its own server (Serenity). In 2011, CCP allowed its licensing agreement with CDC Games, which had acquired Optic in July 2007, to expire. CCP created a new partnership with TianCity to relaunch Serenity on December 11, 2012.

The code base between Serenity (serving China) and Tranquility (serving the rest of the world) is synchronised, so that feature development is distributed to both server clusters, although the game worlds are not connected. &quot;Eve Online&quot; fully supports Unicode and has a back-end system to enable localization of each and every aspect of the game&#x27;s content and UI.

In October 2006, the average age of an &quot;Eve Online&quot; player was 27, and 95% of players were male. The average weekly playtime was 17 hours, or just under 2.5 hours per day. By May 6, 2009, &quot;Eve Online&quot; claimed to have more than 300,000 active subscriptions and 45,000 active trial accounts. The total active subscription count at end of 2010 was 357,000 accounts.

On July 7, 2011, CCP announced that it planned to partner with Nexon Co. Ltd. to bring a &quot;fully localized game client and product services for CCP&#x27;s award winning... EVE Online&quot; to Japan in the fall. Localized services for Japanese players would enable them to access the game in their native language through the Tranquility server, which currently hosts over 350,000 subscribers from around the world in three languages: English, German and Russian.

On May 5, 2013, &quot;Eve Online&quot; claimed a new record for the maximum number of simultaneous pilots online with 65,303 concurrent accounts logged on to the same server at the same time. This record was set on the eve of &quot;Eve Online&quot;″s 10 year anniversary, and topped the previous record of 63,170 set January 23, 2011. &quot;Eve Online&quot; typically experiences the highest number of users on Sundays and the peak player records have almost exclusively been broken on Sundays.

===Player tournaments===
During two weekends in July 2006, a live streaming video production called Eve TV covered the events of the 2nd Caldari Alliance Tournament. The tournament pitted three-man teams from the top alliances against each other. Eve TV provided live in-game footage of the battles along with expert commentary. Analysis of the teams and strategies, interviews with CCP staff and behind-the-scenes specials were also aired between battles. Eve TV was produced and hosted primarily by DJs from Eve-Radio (a player-run streaming radio station) with resources provided by CCP. A total of 95 matches were scheduled, with the Band of Brothers alliance emerging the winner.

The first two weekends in December 2006 saw the 3rd Alliance tournament. This was once again broadcast via live streaming video by Eve TV The tournament saw 40 Alliances pitting five-man teams against each other. Once again, the Band of Brothers alliance emerged as the winner. Of particular note in this tournament was the fielding of an Imperial Apocalypse by the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate. The ship was destroyed in the semi-finals of the tournament by the COW (Cult of War) team. A last-minute attempt to arrange an 8 billion ISK ransom for the ship fell through.

The fourth Alliance tournament in September 2007 brought several upsets, with Star Fraction defeating Band of Brothers in the second round, using only tech 1 cruisers, and Hun Reloaded sweeping both the semifinals and finals to win.

The two weekends starting February 29, 2008, and March 7, 2008, saw the fifth Alliance Tournament. Eve TV provided coverage via live streaming video. During the six days a total of 40 teams competed in 95 matches. The last tournament&#x27;s winner, HUN Reloaded, made its way into the quarter-finals where it lost to Ev0ke alliance, who later became tournament champion after having won all eight of its matches.

The sixth Alliance Tournament was held during three consecutive weekends starting January 24, 2009, and ending on February 8, 2009. A total of 64 teams took part in the qualifying rounds on opening weekend. While the final weekend was broadcast live via Eve TV, the qualifying rounds were broadcast through various &quot;Eve Online&quot; radio channels. A number of changes were made to the tournament rules. This was also the first tournament Factional Militias were able to take part alongside traditional alliance teams. In the final match, R.U.R. went up against Pandemic Legion with Pandemic Legion emerging as the tournament winner.

Alliance Tournament 7 took place in September 2009, with Pandemic Legion winning a second successive tournament, beating Circle of Two in the final. Alliance Tournament 8 took place in June 2010, with Pandemic Legion winning for the third time, beating Hydra Reloaded, while Alliance Tournament 9 took place in June 2011, with Hydra Reloaded as the winner in the uncontested final match against Outbreak.

Alliance Tournament 10 took place over four consecutive weekends in July 2012. 64 Teams took part in the Tournament, with all matches being broadcast live on EVE TV. A number of changes were made to the format of matches, which included increasing the maximum number of pilots from 10 to 12. Verge of Collapse were eventually crowned Champions, defeating Alliance Tournament 4 winners HUN Reloaded in the final. The Alliance stunned everyone beating top teams to claim the title of Champions.

Alliance Tournament 11 took place over the course of three weekends in July and August 2013, with Pandemic Legion beating Exodus. in the loser&#x27;s bracket, then coming back from a 2–0 score in a best of five match against Hydra Reloaded to win 3 matches in a row and win their fourth Alliance Tournament, and their first victory since Alliance Tournament 8.

===Volunteer program===
The Interstellar Services Department (ISD) is a group of volunteers, made up of subscribed players, who assist in a variety of tasks like answering questions from players, bug hunting and QA testing, covering player-driven news, and writing game fiction. It includes ECAID (Equipment Certification and Anomaly Investigations Division), STAR (Support, Training and Resources), IC (Interstellar Correspondents), M (Mercury), CCL (Community Communication Liaisons), and YARR (Yulai Archives &amp; Records Repository Team).

==Development==
According to the developers, &quot;Eve Online&quot; evolved from the classic computer game &quot;Elite&quot;, which itself was based on concepts from the science-fiction role-playing game &quot;Traveller&quot;. &quot;Eve&quot; combined concepts from &quot;Elite&quot; with the multi player chat and player-versus-player aspects of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. &quot;Elite&quot; had four single-player aspects: missions, mining, trade routes and combat with random hostile NPCs, all of which are aspects of the first incarnations of &quot;Eve Online&quot;.

One of the original developers of &quot;Elite&quot;, David Braben, believes &quot;Eve Online&quot; is a reimplementation of the 1980s game, not its true successor. Some of the developers (John Cameron, James Cassidy, Joe Chaney) also believe that this game creates a world where players can become someone else only possible in their imaginations.

Both the server and the client software for &quot;Eve Online&quot; are developed in Stackless Python, a variant of the Python programming language. Stackless Python allows a relatively large number of players to perform tasks without the overhead of using the call stack used in the standard Python distribution. This frees the game developers from performing some routine work and allows them to apply changes to the game universe without resetting the server. However, the Eve cluster is taken offline daily for database and server maintenance.

===Compatibility===
On March 14, 2006, the &quot;Eve Online&quot; development team announced that they would be upgrading the graphics engine of &quot;Eve Online&quot; to a DirectX 10 / Windows Vista graphics platform. Revelations patch 1.4 had patch notes quoted as saying that the current &quot;Eve Online&quot; client should work in Vista &quot;as well as it does in XP&quot;.

On September 10, 2007, CCP Games announced that the new &quot;Trinity 2&quot; graphics engine will be using DirectX 9.0. This was released on December 5, 2007.

Official support for Linux and Mac platforms, using Transgaming Technologies Cedega and Cider (forks of Wine) for Linux and Mac compatibility, was introduced with the Revelations 2.3 patch released on November 6, 2007. At Fanfest 2008 Transgaming announced and demonstrated that the Premium graphics client is now running on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. In February 2009 CCP announced that they planned to discontinue the official Linux client with the next major patch, and advised on using third-party programs to run the Windows version of the client under Linux (namely Wine). The discontinuation of the official Linux client was primarily because the game ran better using the Windows client via Wine than it did with the official one, as a result many Linux users were already using Wine instead.

On December 4, 2020, CCP Games announced the development of a native Mac client, running on macOS Big Sur and using the Metal graphics framework; the initial release supporting Intel-based Macs was targeted for the first half of 2021, with a subsequent release to support M1-based Macs.

===Third-party applications and the Eve API Project===
Third-party applications supplement players&#x27; &quot;Eve Online&quot; experience. Some of these, such as automated applications designed to claim publicly available contracts accidentally put up without an associated cost, can result in a ban if discovered, while others are endorsed, tacitly or explicitly, by CCP. EVEMon, a .NET application that monitors and forecasts skill training times, is one example of an explicitly authorized external application. Another such application, Eve Fitting Tool or EFT, allows players to try different ship setups and see how certain skills and modules will affect that ship.

Third-party applications to monitor character information and skill training exist for both the Android and iPhone mobile platforms.

In May 2005, CCP announced the Eve API Project; third-party utilities such as EVEMon now interface with character data, market, and other data through an API.

===Major content patches===
Since the initial release of &quot;Eve Online&quot;, CCP has added twenty-one expansions to the game, free of additional charge to its subscribers. The twentieth expansion &quot;Rubicon&quot;, was released on November 19, 2013, and focused on new faction ships, introduction of mobile structures, and the first steps towards &quot;The Future of EVE&quot; outlined by CCP Seagull. The nineteenth expansion, &quot;Odyssey&quot;, was released on June 4, 2013, and focused on exploration and rebalancing battleships. The eighteenth expansion, &quot;Retribution&quot;, focused on a newly re-worked Crimewatch system. It also introduced the newly rebalanced frigates, destroyers, cruisers, and battlecruisers. The seventeenth expansion, &quot;Inferno&quot;, added enhanced graphics for missile systems, a host of new ship modules, and a controversial new &quot;Unified Inventory&quot; UI. The sixteenth expansion, &quot;Crucible&quot;, was released in November 2011 and shifted the focus from cosmetic changes to game mechanics. The fifteenth expansion, &quot;Incarna&quot;, was released in the first stage of CCP&#x27;s controversial Ambulation project, also known as the &quot;Walking in Stations&quot; project. &quot;Incarna&quot; added &quot;Captain&#x27;s Quarters&quot; to stations, the first phase of allowing players to explore stations as human avatars, as well as an update to ship turret models. The fourteenth expansion, &quot;Incursion&quot;, was released in stages, the second of which introduced the Sansha Incursions, in which Sansha&#x27;s Nation invaded constellations, disrupting all forms of activity in the area, but provided large rewards for fighting back the incursions, and an overhaul of the character creation tool, paving the way for the &quot;Incarna&quot; expansion.

The eleventh expansion of &quot;Eve Online&quot;, &quot;Apocrypha&quot;, was released on March 10, 2009, and introduced features such as further graphics updates as started in the Trinity expansion; the ability for players to group their vessels&#x27; weapons for easier interaction; changes to autopilot routes and avoidance of player-defined star systems. The twelfth expansion, &quot;Dominion&quot;, was released on December 1, 2009, and overhauled the sovereignty system, while the thirteenth expansion, &quot;Tyrannis&quot;, released on May 26, 2010, added planetary interaction as well as the online platform &quot;EVE Gate&quot;.

Over time, expansions have added features such as conquerable and constructible space stations, massive capital ships, advanced versions of existing ships, or &quot;Epic Arcs&quot; for players to master. Apocrypha included an overhauled probing system, wormholes, a smarter and tougher AI and customizable Tech 3 ships as its major features. Dominion, which became available for download on December 1, 2009, included an overhaul of the sovereignty system, more realistic astronomy, the Titan Doomsday weapon functionality being changed and the in-game web browser with Chromium&#x27;s WebKit. It also included a redesign of the UI and in-game mailing system. Tyrannis added new features, such as the ability to exploit planetary resources, a social networking program called EVE Gate, new technology for ships, and graphical updates.

====Rapid release cycle====
On May 6, 2014, at their yearly Fanfest convention, CCP announced the move from the current development cycle of two expansions per year, to ten feature-releases per year on a rapid release cycle. Senior Producer of EVE Online Andie Nordgren (CCP Seagull) stated that the move was necessary for future developments to have a more flexible release cycle, rather than the deadline imposed on the previous system, allowing smaller patches and changes to be deployed more rapidly and large projects not having to be rushed due to the expansion deadline.

However, in September 2015, Nordgren announced that CCP, while continuing with a five-week release cycle, would return to intermittently releasing large scale expansions for &quot;EVE&quot;. She described the new release cycle as a &quot;hybrid form&quot;, where expansions would be &quot;a set of big, connected features&quot; with no fixed number per year, while the feature-releases would continue to bring &quot;quality of life changes, ship balance changes, visual upgrades&quot; and other smaller additions. The first new expansion, which was announced at EVE Vegas 2015, introduced a new modular starbase called a Citadel, and an overhaul of capital-class ships.

===Planned future developments===
The developers have been working on a game feature to allow players to exit pods and interact with other player avatars in the communal setting of a station interior. The first iteration, called Captain&#x27;s Quarters, was released on June 21, 2011. The second iteration, with stylised quarters for each race, was released with the Crucible expansion. Player interaction in station environments has not yet been announced and only preliminary details have emerged.

The ability to enter a planet&#x27;s atmosphere and to interact with its surface is mentioned as one of the future development plans. The &quot;Future Vision&quot; trailer portrays Dreadnaught-class ships performing planetary orbital bombardments on Dust battlefields. The first glimpse trailer of Dust 514 ended with a ship exploding in the atmosphere. However, the interaction between Dust and Eve has not been fully defined and no official confirmation has yet been provided. At Eve Fanfest 2005, a working prototype was demonstrated in which a Caldari Crow interceptor could be seen navigating a makeshift landscape superimposed on a nebula. However, this effort was later abandoned. CCP has stated that full-scale integration of such features requires an enormous effort and is only planned for post-Revelations (expansion) production phases, 2006. Subsequently, it was stated that, until a proven in-game reason is found for planetary access, further work on this feature will not have a high priority.

====&quot;Dust 514&quot;====

During the 2009 Games Convention in Cologne, Germany, CCP unveiled &quot;Dust 514&quot;, a console-based MMOFPS title meant to integrate with the &quot;Eve Online&quot; universe. According to developers, players hired by &quot;Eve Online&quot; alliances would fight over planets.

According to &quot;Eve Online&quot; Creative Director Torfi Frans Ólafsson, at the 2009 Eve Online Fanfest, the Dominion release is planned to involve sovereignty, the ownership of districts on planets that are capable of creating industry. This player ownership system will be dynamic as it will be subject to PvP diplomacy as well as subjugation. The latter allows for linking with &quot;Dust 514&quot;, whereby players within &quot;Eve Online&quot; will be able to contract, in-game, &quot;Dust 514&quot; players to take control of planetary regions within the &quot;Eve Online&quot; universe and these &#x27;mercenaries&#x27; will then vie with other &quot;Dust 514&quot; players hired by the opposing faction. The integration between the console MMOFPS game and the &quot;Eve Online&quot; MMORPG is both through community interaction and through the changeable battlefields based on the planetary architecture of a common universe the outcome of these battles in &quot;Dust 514&quot; will affect the status and ownership of the corresponding planets in &quot;Eve Online&quot; as well. At E3 2011, it was announced that &quot;Dust 514&quot; is a PlayStation 3 exclusive with a PS Vita tie-in, both to be released in early 2012.

===Decompiled source code===
On May 20, 2011, decompiled &quot;EVE Online&quot; source code was published by an unknown person on a GitHub repository. After being online for four days, CCP issued a DMCA take-down request which was granted by GitHub.

==Music==

The &quot;Eve Online&quot; soundtrack was composed by Jón Hallur Haraldsson, also known as Real-X. Icelandic rap-rock group Quarashi also composed several tracks for the game. A digital soundtrack titled &quot;EVE Online: Original Soundtrack, Vol. 1&quot; was released on iTunes on August 12, 2009. The soundtrack comes with an audio book track &quot;EVE Chronicle – Taught Thoughts&quot;. The soundtrack has since been removed from iTunes.

The game itself contains an extensive in-game soundtrack. On December 4, 2012, the &quot;Retribution&quot; expansion of &quot;Eve Online&quot; was released. Among its features was the removal of the Jukebox, which enabled players to select their favorite songs to play. In tandem with this, CCP Games announced that the entire game soundtrack (consisting of music in the game at the time) would be available to download for free from SoundCloud. The soundtrack consists of 74 songs, with a running time of nearly seven hours.

==Public perception==
===Virtual crime===
Piracy (in the ship-to-ship sense) is part of the game, as are protection racketeering, theft, and ransom. &quot;Eve Online&quot; periodically has arisen for discussion within the wider gaming community as players of the game find various ingenious methods of scamming, deceiving, or attacking each other. One infamous example was a corporate infiltration and where one corporation infiltrated a target corporation over the course of nearly a year. They then performed a virtual assassination on the target&#x27;s CEO and proceeded to steal corporate property to which they had gained access. The target corporation lost billions of ISK worth of property (amounting to about US$16,500) and a great deal of prestige; the CEO&#x27;s expensive ship and cybernetic implants were destroyed in the attack. Events of this nature are debated both inside the game world and in the media.

In 2009, a player alliance known as Goonswarm was contacted by a disgruntled director of rival alliance Band of Brothers, one of the largest alliances in the game at that time. The defecting director then stripped Band of Brothers of a large quantity of assets including ships, money and territory, and disbanded the alliance.

A player-run bank known as &#x27;EBank&#x27; was also involved in controversy in 2009 when Ricdic, the CEO of the bank, withdrew 200 billion ISK and converted it into real world currency worth about to make a down payment on a home and pay for medical expenses.

Such dangers are an inherent part of &quot;Eve Online&quot;″s virtual economy and thus are purposely not dealt with by the developers. Players are expected to make financial decisions based (among other factors) on the possibility of other players&#x27; fiduciary malfeasance, much as in real-life economics.

The most common acts of piracy in &quot;Eve&quot; are , gate camping, and small gang warfare. Every pirate corporation in &quot;Eve Online&quot; has its own preferred activities, strategies, and tactics. Some utilize cheap but high damage ships to &quot;suicide gank&quot; and kill players in high-security space (where they should theoretically be safe) quickly before CONCORD law enforcement units arrive to destroy them (thus &quot;suiciding&quot;), in the knowledge that certain ships they destroy will be carrying valuable commodities or expensive gear capable of recovering the cost of the pirate vessels lost in the gank. Others choose to set up gate camping fleets consisting of varied ship types and roles capable of rapidly disabling and destroying any unwitting passersby, thereby locking down star systems and killing or robbing whoever tries to pass through. Other pirates choose to roam in very fast and versatile skirmish ships, such as interceptors, recons, or heavy assault ships, killing anyone they encounter in lightning attacks. On gaining the upper hand in a fight many pirates will ask the victim for an ISK ransom, in exchange for sparing their ship or escape pod.

Suicide ganking has declined in overall popularity since the release of the &quot;Crucible&quot; expansion; while players may opt to insure their ships against loss using in-game currency, pilots will no longer be reimbursed if their ship is destroyed by CONCORD. Such changes have been the subject of intense debate on the game&#x27;s official forums, with opinions divided on whether or not players should be truly &#x27;safe&#x27; while flying.

===Developer misconduct===
Instances of developer misconduct in &quot;Eve Online&quot; have been substantiated, leading to debates and controversy. On February 9, 2007, a player known as Kugutsumen hacked an enemy corporation&#x27;s private forum to find out and reveal that &quot;Eve Online&quot; developer t20 had provided his corporation, Reikoku, with six valuable blueprints, giving them an advantage over competing corporations. Some within the &quot;Eve Online&quot; community asked for t20&#x27;s dismissal. While an apology letter was left for the community in the form of a dev blog, he remained an &quot;Eve Online&quot; developer until late 2008. Kugutsumen was permanently banned from the &quot;Eve Online&quot; universe for violating the game&#x27;s terms of service and end-user license agreement by revealing t20&#x27;s real name.

In response to public concerns, CCP decided to set up an internal affairs division whose responsibility is to monitor the activities of both privileged and player accounts operated by CCP staff in-game.

===Council of Stellar Management===
In part due to the matters above, CCP invited users to stand for the first Council of Stellar Management (CSM) in March 2008, resulting in 66 candidates seeking election to nine positions. It was a requirement that candidates release their full real names in addition to stating their in-game details. In May, after a two-week voting period, the first Council was elected, comprising seven men and two women; three each from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, two from the US and one from Denmark, their ages ranging from 17 to 52.

The remit of the council has been changed since it was first proposed and is now seen by CCP primarily as a route for players to make requests for changes and improvements to the game mechanics, presentation, and game content of &quot;Eve Online&quot;. The first four Councils served for six months, after which new ones were to be elected. Each individual was only permitted to serve twice. Each CSM gets the authority to put requests to CCP three times during their term of office which CCP have stated must be answered; once in person in Iceland and twice by e-mail, with most of the costs of their visit to Iceland being borne by CCP. The rules were changed for the fifth CSM to feature one-year terms with two Iceland trips and four email requests, as well as the abolition of the two-term limit.

The first meeting of the CSM with CCP took place in Reykjavik between June 19 and 23, 2008, and included not only the nine CSM members but a number of developers, designers, game masters, and producers from CCP and members of print and video media. Matters discussed by players on the &quot;Eve Online&quot; forums were reviewed in detail and whilst some were rejected for technical reasons, many were accepted by CCP as useful improvements to the game which would be introduced either in an early so-called point release or added to the development plans for a future major update.

Nominations for the second CSM opened on September 26, 2008, with voting commencing on November 9. The following third Council of Stellar Management included a modified age restriction: candidates under the age of 21 are then no longer eligible as CSM members.

Beginning with the eighth CSM, a single transferable vote system was introduced, allowing voters to select up to 14 candidates.

==Accounts and subscriptions==
Users start playing &quot;Eve Online&quot; by creating a free account (known as an Alpha account), being invited to the game as via the game&#x27;s Recruit-A-Friend program, or purchasing the &quot;Eve Online&quot; Special Edition retail box. Alpha accounts are freely available through both the &quot;Eve Online&quot; website and the Steam content delivery system. The accounts through the Recruit-A-Friend program function identically to normal Alpha accounts, but start with some additional unallocated skill points (worth approximately 5–6 days worth of training time) on their first character. In addition, if the recruited account is subsequently converted to a subscription account (known as an Omega account), the referrer is rewarded with 30 free days of subscription time or the equivalent amount of PLEX.

Alpha accounts are free and allow players to access most of the &quot;Eve Online&quot; game, with exceptions. Alpha players cannot train skills for some advanced ship types or modules, including all Tech 2 ships and most Tech 2 modules. Alpha accounts can also only passive train up to 5 million skill points using the normal skill training system. After that limit, the only way they can acquire more skill points is by converting to Omega, using skill point injectors (available on the in-game market), or skill point rewards, e.g. by the AIR Career Program or the Daily Skilling Spree. In December, 2017, an additional item called a Daily Alpha Injector was added to the game, available for purchase via the official game store for PLEX. This item is only usable by Alpha accounts, is only usable once per day, awards a number of skill points roughly equal to a full 24 hours of training time, and costs slightly more than 1/30th as much as a 30-day subscription. This allows Alpha accounts to progress at a similar rate and cost to an Omega account even beyond the 5 million skill point limit, but to purchase that progression in smaller increments than a full 30-day subscription. Alpha accounts are limited to a specific list of skills and levels in those skills, and are unable to inject skill points into disallowed skills or beyond the maximum level in allowed skills. Alpha accounts have approximately 20.5 million skillpoints worth of skills available to them.

Omega accounts that lapse on their subscription are downgraded to Alpha accounts. These accounts don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; any skill points or skills, but any skills or skill levels beyond those allowed for an Alpha account are inactive and cannot be used to fulfill the prerequisites of modules or ships, nor do the passive effects of those skills take effect. Functionally, Omega accounts that lapse into Alpha accounts can only access and use any of those skills that are on the Alpha skill list (and thus may not be able to fly ships that they could as an Omega pilot), but if they later upgrade back to Omega, they regain access to their full skill list.

As of June 2008, Eve Time Codes (or ETCs) are available exclusively in 60-day increments. Before then, they were also offered in 30-, 50-, 90-, 100- and 120-day increments. Discontinued cards remain valid. Players using ETCs are treated like normal subscribers in every way. Eve Time Codes are available through CCP&#x27;s online store as well as via online resellers. Cards purchased through resellers are usually delivered through email for immediate use while codes issued through the &quot;Eve Online&quot; store are issued via postal mail or in-game item, and as such ETCs do not violate the EULA and can be bought and sold within the game. There are no distinguishing differences in functionality between digital and hard-copy codes. Both provide the exact amount of specified game time, are entered into the same account section and can be exchanged between players for ISK using a secure exchange system facilitated by a &quot;Timecode Bazaar&quot; forum.

In November 2008, CCP introduced PLEX, the CONCORD Pilots License EXtension, which is an in-game item that can be used to extend a subscription for 30 days. PLEX can be purchased on the Eve Online website for real money, or inside the game for ISK. 60-day ETCs can be converted to two 30-day PLEX within the Eve Online client, which can then be sold via the in-game market. PLEX is the reason that the cost of in-game assets can be translated into real-life money. As the price of a PLEX is around €15, it can be calculated how much a certain ship or implant is theoretically worth in a real currency.

In May 2017, CCP converted PLEX into smaller increments. All existing PLEX were converted to 500 of the new PLEX (which are exclusively referred to as PLEX in-game, rather than Pilot License EXtension, though the acronym meaning remains unchanged). 30 days subscriptions now cost 500 PLEX, effectively the same cost as previously. The previous premium currency, Aurum, was retired and converted to PLEX at the same exchange rate as PLEX could be exchanged for Aurum previously (1 old PLEX per 3500 Aurum, so 1 new PLEX per 7 Aurum), provided the account had at least 1000 Aurum to convert. All items in the premium store that used to cost Aurum now cost an equivalent number of PLEX. This allowed CCP to market more granular deals on PLEX, as well as price certain services for PLEX with more granularity. For example, Multiple Character Training used to cost 1 PLEX, the same prices as 30 days of subscription time, but now costs 450 PLEX, 90% of the cost of 30 days of subscription time. In the same patch, CCP also introduced the PLEX Vault, a safe and secure way of moving PLEX around in-game without risking the item being lost if one&#x27;s ship were destroyed.

As of March 10, 2009, a boxed edition is available in shops. The distribution is being managed by Atari. The boxed edition includes a 60-day ETC, instant standings update to facilitate quicker entry into factional warfare, exclusive online new player guide, and an exclusive expanded cargo hold shuttle. Although marketed as included in the retail box, the bonus items are only available to new accounts created with the 60-day ETC.

==Reception==
&quot;Eve Online&quot; received mixed reviews at the launch of the game in 2003 but more favorable reviews later in its lifecycle. The original version received 75% on GameRankings and 69/100 on Metacritic. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; released in 2009 has an aggregate score of 88/100 on Metacritic.

In 2004, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated the expansion &quot;Eve Online: Second Genesis&quot; for &quot;Massively Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot; at the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. Then for three consecutive years, the Academy also nominated the following expansions for &quot;Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year&quot;: &quot;Revelations&quot; in 2007, &quot;Trinity&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Quantum Rise&quot; in 2009.

In 2013, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; placed &quot;Eve Online&quot; at #12 on their list of 100 Greatest Games of All Time.

In June 2013, the Museum of Modern Art added &quot;Eve Online&quot; to its permanent collection of video games. The game is showcased as a &quot;day in the universe&quot; video. To create this, CCP Games called upon &quot;Eve Online&quot;″s large player-base to provide gameplay footage of the game. Furthermore, CCP Games contributed a large amount of data from its servers, which were compiled to produce a &quot;stunning view&quot; of the accomplishments of player collaborations.

==Other media==
In 2013, CCP said that they had made deals to create both a comic book and a television series based on &quot;Eve Online&quot;. The comic, titled &quot;Eve: True Stories&quot;, was released by Dark Horse Comics and made available for free online in 2014. Following this, a physical version of the graphic novel containing bonus material was made available that same year. To make the television series, CCP signed a deal with Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur. As of May 2013, no information has been given about the title or the premiere date of the television series. The storylines from both the graphic novel and the television series will be based on actual player-driven events that happened in the game.

<text>61 (sixty-one) is the natural number following 60 and preceding 62.

==In mathematics==
61 is the 18th prime number, and a twin prime with 59. As a centered square number, it is the sum of two consecutive squares, formula_1. It is also a centered decagonal number, and a centered hexagonal number.

61 is the fourth cuban prime of the form formula_2 where formula_3, and the fourth Pillai prime since formula_4 is divisible by 61, but 61 is not one more than a multiple of 8. It is also a Keith number, as it recurs in a Fibonacci-like sequence started from its base 10 digits: 6, 1, 7, 8, 15, 23, 38, 61, ...

61 is a unique prime in base 14, since no other prime has a 6-digit period in base 14, and palindromic in bases 6 (1416) and 60 (1160). It is the sixth up/down or Euler zigzag number.

61 is the smallest &quot;proper prime&quot;, a prime formula_5 which ends in the digit 1 in decimal and whose reciprocal in base-10 has a repeating sequence of length formula_6 where each digit (0, 1, ..., 9) appears in the repeating sequence the same number of times as does each other digit (namely, formula_7 times).

In the list of Fortunate numbers, 61 occurs thrice, since adding 61 to either the tenth, twelfth or seventeenth primorial gives a prime number (namely 6,469,693,291; 7,420,738,134,871; and 1,922,760,350,154,212,639,131).

There are sixty-one 3-uniform tilings.

Sixty-one is the exponent of the ninth Mersenne prime, formula_8 and the next candidate exponent for a potential fifth double Mersenne prime: formula_9

61 is also the largest prime factor in Descartes number,

formula_10

This number would be the only known odd perfect number if one of its composite factors (22021 = 192 × 61) were prime.

61 is the largest prime number (less than the largest supersingular prime, 71) that does not divide the order of any sporadic group (including any of the pariahs).

The exotic sphere formula_11 is the last odd-dimensional sphere to contain a unique smooth structure; formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14 are the only other such spheres.

<text>62 (sixty-two) is the natural number following 61 and preceding 63.

== In mathematics ==

62 is:

* the eighteenth discrete semiprime (formula_1) and tenth of the form (2.q), where q is a higher prime.
* with an aliquot sum of 34; itself a semiprime, within an aliquot sequence of seven composite numbers (62,34,20,22,14,10,8,7,1,0) to the Prime in the 7-aliquot tree. This is the longest aliquot sequence for a semiprime up to 118 which has one more sequence member. 62 is the tenth member of the 7-aliquot tree (7, 8, 10, 14, 20, 22, 34, 38, 49, 62, 75, 118, 148, etc).
*a nontotient.
*palindromic and a repdigit in bases 5 (2225) and 30 (2230) 
*the sum of the number of faces, edges and vertices of icosahedron or dodecahedron.
*the number of faces of two of the Archimedean solids, the rhombicosidodecahedron and truncated icosidodecahedron.
*the smallest number that is the sum of three distinct positive squares in two (or more) ways, formula_2 
*the only number whose cube in base 10 (238328) consists of 3 digits each occurring 2 times.
*The 20th &amp; 21st, 72nd &amp; 73rd, 75th &amp; 76th digits of pi.

===Square root of 62===
As a consequence of the mathematical coincidence that 106 − 2 = 999,998 = 62 × 1272, the decimal representation of the square root of 62 has a curiosity in its digits:

formula_3 = 7.874 007874 011811 019685 034448 812007 …

For the first 22 significant figures, each six-digit block is 7,874 or a half-integer multiple of it. 

7,874 × 1.5 = 11,811

7,874 × 2.5 = 19,685

The pattern follows from the following polynomial series:

formula_4

Plugging in x = 10−6 yields formula_5, and formula_3 = formula_7.

<text>St Clement Eastcheap is a Church of England parish church in Candlewick Ward of the City of London. It is located on Clement&#x27;s Lane, off King William Street and close to London Bridge and the River Thames.

Clement was a disciple of St Peter the Apostle and was ordained as Bishop of Rome in the year 93 AD. By legend, Clement was martyred by being tied to an anchor and thrown into the Black Sea, which led to his adoption as a patron saint of sailors. The dedication to St Clement is unusual in London, with only one other ancient church there dedicated to this saint, namely St Clement Danes, Westminster. It is also located a little north of the Thames, but further west from Eastcheap and outside the old City boundary, just beyond the Temple Bar on the Strand. Both churches claim to be the &quot;Clements&quot; referred to in the children&#x27;s nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons.

== History ==

===Medieval period===
Eastcheap was one of the main streets of medieval London. The name &#x27;Eastcheap&#x27; derives from the Saxon word &#x27;cheap&#x27;, meaning a market, and Eastcheap was so called to distinguish it from Westcheap, later to become Cheapside. The southern end of Clement&#x27;s Lane opened onto Eastcheap until the 1880s when the construction of King William Street separated Clement&#x27;s Lane from Eastcheap, which still remains nearby as a street.

The church&#x27;s dedication to a Roman patron saint of sailors, the martyr Bishop Clement, coupled with its location near to what were historically the bustling wharves of Roman London, hints at a much earlier Roman origin. Indeed, Roman remains were once found in Clement&#x27;s Lane, comprising walls 3 feet thick and made of flints at a depth of 12–15 feet together with tessellated pavements.

A charter of 1067 given by William I (1028–87) to Westminster Abbey mentions a church of St. Clement, which is possibly St. Clement Eastcheap, but the earliest definite reference to the church is found in a deed written in the reign of Henry III (1207–72), which mentions &#x27;St Clement Candlewickstrate&#x27;. Other early documents refer to the church as &quot;St Clement in Candlewystrate&quot;, &#x27;St Clement the Little by Estchepe&#x27; and &#x27;St Clement in Lumbard Street&#x27;. Until the dissolution of the monasteries – during the reign of Henry VIII – the parish was in the &#x27;gift&#x27; of the Abbot of Westminster, then patronage of the parish passed to the Bishop of London. Now the patronage alternates with the appointment of each successive new parish priest (Rector), between the Bishop of London and the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s.

According to the London historian John Strype (1643–1737) St. Clement&#x27;s church was repaired and beautified in 1630 and 1633.

===Destruction and rebuilding===
In 1666 the church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London, and then rebuilt in the 1680s. According to Strype the rebuilt church was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and this would seem to be confirmed by the fact that in the parish account for 1685 there is the following item: &quot;To one third of a hogshead of wine, given to Sir Christopher Wren, £4 2s&quot;. The construction was by Edward Strong the Elder.

In 1670, during the rebuilding of London that followed the fire, the parish was combined with that of St Martin Orgar, which lay on the south side of Eastcheap. At the same time the City planners sought to appropriate a strip of land from the west of St Clement&#x27;s property to widen Clement&#x27;s Lane. This led to a dispute with the parish authorities, who claimed that the proposed plan left too little room to accommodate the families of the newly combined parishes. The matter was resolved by permitting the addition of a 14 ft. building plot, formerly occupied by the churchyard, to the east of the church. It was not until 1683, however, that building of the church began, and was completed in 1687 at a total cost of £4,365.

Although nearby St Martin Orgar had been left in ruins by the Great Fire, the tower survived and, following the unification of the parish with St Clement&#x27;s, the St Martin&#x27;s site was used by French Huguenots who restored the tower and worshiped there until 1820. Later in the decade the ruins of the body of St Martin&#x27;s church were removed to make way for the widening of Cannon Street, but the tower remained until 1851 when it was taken down, and – curiously – replaced with a new tower. The new tower served as a rectory for St. Clement Eastcheap until it was sold and converted into offices in the 1970s; it still survives on the present-day Martin Lane.

===19th century===

In May 1840 Edward John Carlos wrote in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, protesting about the proposed demolition of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange and St. Benet Fink, following a fire in 1838 that had razed the Royal Exchange and damaged those two churches. In his article, Carlos referred to earlier plans to reduce the number of City churches, from which we learn that in the 1830s St Clement&#x27;s had been under threat of demolition.

The sweeping design of destroying a number of City churches was mediated in … 1834, and for the time arrested by the resolute opposition to the measure in the instance of the first church marked out for sacrifice, St. Clement Eastcheap, it may be feared is at length coming into full operation, not, indeed in the open manner in which it was displayed at that period, but in an insidious and more secure mode of procedure.

While St Clement&#x27;s was spared, the 19th century saw many other City churches being destroyed, particularly following the Union of Benefices Act (1860), which sought to speed-up the reduction in the number of City parishes as a response to rapidly declining congregations; the result of the resident population moving in ever larger numbers from cramped City conditions to the more spacious suburbs.

In 1872 William Butterfield, a prominent architect of the gothic-revival, substantially renovated St. Clement&#x27;s to conform with the contemporary Anglican &#x27;High Church&#x27; taste. The renovation involved removing the galleries; replacing the 17th-century plain windows with stained glass; dividing the reredos into three pieces and placing the two wings on the side walls; dismantling the woodwork to build new pews; laying down polychrome tiles on the floor, and moving the organ into the aisle.

===20th century===
In 1933 the architect Sir Ninian Comper revised Butterfield&#x27;s layout, moving the organ to its original position on the west wall and reassembling the reredos behind the altar, although before he did so, he had the reredos painted with figures in blue and gold.

St. Clement&#x27;s suffered minor damage from bombing by German aircraft during the London Blitz in 1940 during the Second World War. The damage was repaired in 1949–50, and in 1968 the church was again redecorated.

===Present===

Today St Clement&#x27;s holds weekly services and, from 1998 to 2011, it was the base of The Players of St Peter, an amateur theatre company devoted to performing medieval mystery plays in the church, around early December each year. The Players are now based at the church of St George in the East.
A number of charities have their administrative offices at St Clement&#x27;s. The Cure Parkinson&#x27;s Trust was based here for several years but is now at 120 Baker Street, London.

== &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; ==
St Clement Eastcheap considers itself to be the church referred to in the nursery rhyme that begins &quot;Oranges and lemons / Say the bells of St Clement&#x27;s&quot;. So too does St Clement Danes Church, Westminster, whose bells ring out the traditional tune of the nursery rhyme three times a day.

There is a canard that the earliest mention of the rhyme occurs in Wynkyn de Worde&#x27;s &quot;The demaundes joyous&quot; printed in 1511. This small volume consists entirely of riddles and makes no allusion to bells, St. Clement or any other church.

According to Iona and Peter Opie, the earliest record of the rhyme only dates to c.1744, although there is a square dance (without words) called &#x27;Oranges and Limons&#x27; in the 3rd edition of John Playford&#x27;s &quot;The English Dancing Master&quot;, published in 1665.

St Clement Eastcheap&#x27;s claim is based on the assertion that it was close to the wharf where citrus fruit was unloaded. Yet, a perusal of a map of London shows that there were many churches, even after the Fire, that were closer to the Thames than St. Clement&#x27;s (St. George Botolph Lane, St Magnus the Martyr, St. Michael, Crooked Lane, St Martin Orgar, St Mary-at-Hill, All Hallows the Great. All these would have been passed by a load of oranges and lemons making its way to Leadenhall Market, the nearest market where citrus fruit was sold, passing several more churches on the way. Thus, it would appear that the name of St. Clements was selected by the rhymer simply for its consonance with the word ‘lemons’, and it now seems more likely that the melody called ‘Oranges and Limons’ predates the rhyme itself.

== Building ==

St. Clement Eastcheap has an irregular plan. The nave is approximately rectangular, but the south aisle is severely tapered. The ceiling is divided into panels, the centre one being a large oval band of fruit and flowers. The main façade is on the west, on Clement&#x27;s Lane, and comprises four bays. The main bay has a blocked pedimented round-headed window over the door. This is flanked by matching bays with two levels of windows. The tower to the south west forms the fourth bay. This is a simple square tower, with a parapet, but no spire. Each bay has stone quoins and is stuccoed, except for the upper levels of the tower where the brick is exposed.

A small churchyard remains to the east of St. Clement&#x27;s hemmed-in by the backs of office buildings and contains tombstones whose inscriptions have, over time, become illegible. The churchyard is approached by a narrow alley along the church&#x27;s north wall, at the entrance of which is a memorial plaque to Dositej Obradović, a Serbian scholar who lived next to the church.

In July 1645, so it is said, the poet John Milton was reconciled with his estranged wife Mary Powell, in the house of a Mrs Weber, a widow, in St Clement&#x27;s churchyard where Mary was then lodging. Milton&#x27;s description in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; of the reconciliation of Adam and Eve draws, apparently, on the real life reconciliation between Milton and his wife.

&lt;poem&gt;
She, not repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing
And tresses all disordered, at his feet
Fell humble, and, embracing them, besought
His peace.
Soon his heart relented
Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,
Now to his feet submissive in distress.&lt;/poem&gt;
The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

== Organ ==
The present organ&#x27;s oak case is the same one made to enclose the organ that was built for St Clement&#x27;s in 1696 by Renatus Harris who maintained the instrument until 1704. While the case has remained largely intact, the organ itself has been variously rebuilt and restored; in 1704 by Christian Smith, and in 1711 by Abraham Jordan (c.1666–1716)—who it is thought added the swell organ to the two manual instrument. From 1838 the organ was in the care of Messrs Gray and Davison, who in 1872—as part of the renovation of the building—moved the organ from the west gallery to the south aisle. Care of the organ was transferred to Henry Wedlake that same year. In 1889 he rebuilt the instrument. Further work was undertaken in 1926 by Messrs J. W. Walker, and in 1936 by Messrs Hill, Norman and Beard, whew the instrument was moved back to an approximation of its original west-end location. The same company overhauled the organ in 1946, and in 1971 made &#x27;neo-baroque&#x27; tonal revisions, which remain to this day. The instrument was last cleaned and repaired in 2004 by Colin Jilks of Sittingbourne, Kent.

== Organists ==
The first known organist:
*Henry Lightindollar (died 1702), appeared in the parish records in 1699. Successive organists were as follows:
*William Gorton, a member of the King&#x27;s Music (appt. 1702, died 1711)
*Edward Purcell, son of Henry Purcell (born 1689, appt. 1711, died 1740, and buried in St Clements &quot;near the gallery door&quot; – Parish Burial Register, 4 July 1740)
*Edward Henry Purcell, Edward&#x27;s son (appt.1740, died 1765, and also buried in the church &quot;by the organ gallery&quot; – Parish Burial Register, 5 August 1765)
*Jonathan Battishill (born 1738, appt. 1765, died 1801)
*Thomas Bartholomew (appt. 1802, died 1819)
*William Bradley (appt. 1819, res. 1828)
*John Whitaker, a City music publisher, (appt. 1828, died 1847)
*John Joff, promoted from assistant organist (appt. 1847, died 1885).

The current organist (September 2008) is Ian Shaw.

== Furnishings ==
The altar, with cherubs for legs, dates from the 17th century, as does the reredos, which was decorated during the 1930s restoration of the building in a style reminiscent of Simone Martini. The outer panels depict the Annunciation while the central panel shows St. Clement and St. Martin of Tours, (the dedicatee of St. Martin Orgar).

The pulpit also dates from the 17th-century, and is made from Norwegian oak, topped with an hexagonal sounding board, with a dancing cherub on each corner.

Surviving from the 1872 Butterfield renovation are the polychrome floor and three stained-glass clerestory windows on the north wall. The windows were made by W. G. Taylor, and installed c.1887 during the last phase of Butterfield&#x27;s work. The windows show SS. Andrew, James (major), James (minor), Peter, Mathias, and Thomas.

While the marble font can be seen, its wooden cover is not always on public display. The cover&#x27;s ornate decoration, a carved dove holding an olive branch surrounded with gilded flames, so delighted William Gladstone, it is said, that he took his grandchildren to see it.

== Clergy ==
Thomas Fuller (1608–61), then living in London, preached a series of sermons at St Clement&#x27;s in 1647.

The diarist John Evelyn heard John Pearson (1613–86), later to be Bishop of Chester, preaching at St Clement&#x27;s where he was the weekly preacher from 1654. His sermons there later became his &quot;An Exposition of the Creed&quot; (1659), which he dedicated &quot;to the right worshipful and well-beloved, the parishioners of St. Clement&#x27;s, Eastcheap.&quot;

One of the rectors of St. Clement&#x27;s, Benjamin Stone, who had been presented to the living by Bishop Juxon, being deemed &quot;too Popish&quot; by Oliver Cromwell, was imprisoned for some time at Crosby Hall. From there he was sent to Plymouth where, after paying a fine of £60, he obtained his liberty. Stone recovered his benefice on the restoration of Charles II but died five years after. (Thornbury, volume 1)

In this church Josias Alsopp, who had succeeded Stone as rector in the early Restoration years of the 17th century, was heard preaching by Samuel Pepys who noted the following in his diary for 24 November 1661:

Up early, and by appointment to St. Clement lanes to church, and there to meet Captain Cocke, who had often commended Mr. Alsopp, their minister, to me, who is indeed an able man, but as all things else did not come up to my expectations. His text was that all good and perfect gifts are from above.

Among the mural tablets in the church are three which have been erected at the cost of the parishioners, commemorative of the Rev. Thomas Green, curate twenty-seven years, who died in 1734; the Rev. John Farrer, Rector, who died in 1820; and the Rev. W. Valentine Ireson, who was lecturer of the united parishes for thirty years and died in 1822.

==Memorial==

Immediately next to the church in Clement&#x27;s Lane is a memorial stone to Dositej Obradović (1742–1811), a Serbian statesman and man of letters who became Serbia&#x27;s first Education Minister. He stayed in a house here in 1784. His name here is anglicised to Dositey Obradovich.

<text>63 (sixty-three) is the natural number following 62 and preceding 64.

==Mathematics==
63 is the sum of the first six powers of 2 (20 + 21 + ... 25). It is the eighth highly cototient number, and the fourth centered octahedral number after 7 and 25. For five unlabeled elements, there are 63 posets. 

Sixty-three is the seventh &quot;square-prime&quot; of the form formula_1 and the second of the form formula_2. It contains a prime aliquot sum of 41, the thirteenth indexed prime; and part of the aliquot sequence (63, 41, 1, 0) within the 41-aliquot tree.

Zsigmondy&#x27;s theorem states that where formula_3 are coprime integers for any integer formula_4, there exists a &quot;primitive prime divisor&quot; formula_5 that divides formula_6 and does not divide formula_7 for any positive integer formula_8, except for when

*formula_9, formula_10 with formula_11 having no prime divisors,
*formula_12, formula_13 a power of two, where any odd prime factors of formula_14 are contained in formula_15, which is even; 

and for a special case where formula_16 with formula_17 and formula_18, which yields formula_19.

63 is a &quot;Mersenne number&quot; of the form formula_20 with an formula_21 of formula_22, however this does not yield a Mersenne prime, as 63 is the forty-fourth composite number. It is the only number in the Mersenne sequence whose prime factors are each factors of at least one previous element of the sequence (3 and 7, respectively the first and second Mersenne primes). In the list of Mersenne numbers, 63 lies between Mersenne primes 31 and 127, with 127 the thirty-first prime number. The thirty-first odd number, of the simplest form formula_23, is 63. It is also the fourth Woodall number of the form formula_24 with formula_25, with the previous members being 1, 7 and 23 (they add to 31, the third Mersenne prime). 

In the integer positive definite quadratic matrix formula_26 representative of all (even and odd) integers, the sum of all nine terms is equal to 63.

63 is the third Delannoy number, which represents the number of pathways in a formula_27 grid from a southwest corner to a northeast corner, using only single steps northward, eastward, or northeasterly. 

=== Finite simple groups ===

63 holds thirty-six integers that are relatively prime with itself (and up to), equivalently its Euler totient. In the classification of finite simple groups of Lie type, 63 and 36 are both exponents that figure in the orders of three exceptional groups of Lie type. The orders of these groups are equivalent to the product between the quotient of formula_28 (with formula_5 prime and formula_21 a positive integer) by the GCD of formula_31, and a formula_32 (in capital pi notation, product over a set of formula_33 terms):
:formula_34 the order of exceptional Chevalley finite simple group of Lie type, formula_35
:formula_36 the order of exceptional Chevalley finite simple group of Lie type, formula_37
:formula_38 the order of one of two exceptional Steinberg groups, formula_39

Lie algebra formula_40 holds thirty-six positive roots in sixth-dimensional space, while formula_41 holds sixty-three positive root vectors in the seven-dimensional space (with one hundred and twenty-six total root vectors, twice 63). The thirty-sixth-largest of thirty-seven total complex reflection groups is formula_42, with order formula_43 where the previous formula_44 has order formula_45; these are associated, respectively, with formula_41 and formula_47

There are 63 uniform polytopes in the sixth dimension that are generated from the abstract hypercubic formula_48 Coxeter group (sometimes, the demicube is also included in this family), that is associated with classical Chevalley Lie algebra formula_49 via the orthogonal group and its corresponding special orthogonal Lie algebra (by symmetries shared between unordered and ordered Dynkin diagrams). There are also 36 uniform 6-polytopes that are generated from the formula_50 simplex Coxeter group, when counting self-dual configurations of the regular 6-simplex separately. In similar fashion, formula_50 is associated with classical Chevalley Lie algebra formula_52 through the special linear group and its corresponding special linear Lie algebra.

In the third dimension, there are a total of sixty-three stellations generated with icosahedral symmetry formula_53, using Miller&#x27;s rules; fifty-nine of these are generated by the regular icosahedron and four by the regular dodecahedron, inclusive (as zeroth indexed stellations for regular figures). Though the regular tetrahedron and cube do not produce any stellations, the only stellation of the regular octahedron as a stella octangula is a compound of two self-dual tetrahedra that facets the cube, since it shares its vertex arrangement. Overall, formula_53 of order 120 contains a total of thirty-one axes of symmetry; specifically, the formula_55 lattice that is associated with exceptional Lie algebra formula_56 contains symmetries that can be traced back to the regular icosahedron via the icosians. The icosahedron and dodecahedron can inscribe any of the other three Platonic solids, which are all collectively responsible for generating a maximum of thirty-six polyhedra which are either regular (Platonic), semi-regular (Archimedean), or duals to semi-regular polyhedra containing regular vertex-figures (Catalan), when including four enantiomorphs from two semi-regular snub polyhedra and their duals as well as self-dual forms of the tetrahedron.

Otherwise, the sum of the divisors of sixty-three, formula_57, is equal to the constant term formula_58 that belongs to the principal modular function (McKay–Thompson series) formula_59 of sporadic group formula_60, the second largest such group after the Friendly Giant formula_61. This value is also the value of the minimal faithful dimensional representation of the Tits group formula_62, the only finite simple group that can categorize as being &quot;non-strict&quot; of Lie type, or loosely sporadic; that is also twice the faithful dimensional representation of exceptional Lie algebra formula_63, in 52 dimensions.

<text>Joscelin II (died 1159) was the fourth and last ruling count of Edessa. He was son of his predecessor, Joscelin I, and Beatrice, daughter of Constantine I of Armenia.

==Biography==
===Youth===
In 1122, Joscelin I was captured by Belek Ghazi. The next year, he was joined in captivity by Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Joscelin I was rescued in 1123 by Armenian soldiers, and he worked with Baldwin&#x27;s wife Morphia to secure the king&#x27;s release. The young Joscelin II and Baldwin&#x27;s daughter Ioveta were ransomed for Baldwin&#x27;s release in 1124. Joscelin II and Ioveta were released in 1125 in exchange for 80,000 dinars, spoils from Baldwin&#x27;s victory over al-Bursuqi at the battle of Azaz. In 1131, his father Joscelin I was wounded in battle with the Danishmends, and Edessa passed to Joscelin II. Joscelin II refused to march the small Edessan army out to meet the Danishmends, so Joscelin I, in his last act, forced the Danishmends to retreat, dying soon after.

===Count of Edessa===
Joscelin II ruled the weakest and most isolated of the Crusader states. In 1138 he allied with Antioch and Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos to attack Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo, and the campaign ended with the unsuccessful Siege of Shaizar of 1138. Upon returning to Antioch, Joscelin II exploited local sentiment against the Byzantine Empire to instigate a riot that forced John to return home.

In 1143 both John II and Fulk of Jerusalem died, leaving Joscelin II with no powerful allies to help defend Edessa. In autumn 1144, Joscelin II formed an alliance with the Artuqid Kara Aslan and marched a sizable army north to assist in their struggle with Zengi. With the capital only lightly defended, Zengi redirected his army, invading and capturing the city after the Siege of Edessa in 1144. Joscelin II fled to Turbessel, where he held the remnants of the county west of the Euphrates.

===Captivity===
After Yarankash, a Frankish slave, assassinated Zengi in September 1146, Joscelin II recaptured Edessa in October 1146. Receiving no help from the other Crusader states, the city was again lost in November, as Joscelin&#x27;s expedition was driven out by Zengi&#x27;s son Nur ad-Din. The Second Crusade, called in response to the fall of Edessa, shifted its focus to Damascus. In 1150 while en route to Antioch to enlist help, Joscelin II was taken prisoner by Nur-ed-Din&#x27;s Turkomans. Joscelin II was taken to the city of Aleppo where he was led before a hostile crowd and publicly blinded. He spent the remaining nine years of his life in captivity in a Muslim prison. He died in the dungeons of the Citadel of Aleppo in 1159.

==Family==
He married Beatrice of Saone, the widow of the wealthy Antiochene baron, William of Zardana. She gave birth to at least two daughters and a son surviving to adulthood:

* Agnes of Courtenay married Amalric I of Jerusalem, later king of Jerusalem. After her divorce from Amalric, she held the lands and incomes of the County of Jaffa. Joscelin II&#x27;s grandchildren Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and Sibylla of Jerusalem were in turn monarchs of Jerusalem, as was his great-grandson Baldwin V of Jerusalem.
* Joscelin III of Edessa held the nominal title Count of Edessa, being in reality the lord of a small seigneurie near Acre.
* Isabella of Courtenay, possibly married Thoros II, Prince of Armenia had two daughters.

<text>Fingest is a village in Buckinghamshire, England. 

It is in the Chiltern Hills near the border with Oxfordshire. It is about six miles WSW of High Wycombe. It lies in the civil parish of Hambleden.

The parish church of St Bartholomew&#x27;s dates from the early Norman period. It has an unusual tower, with a double vaulted roof. The church is a Grade I listed building.

==Name==

===Name history===

* Tinghurst, Tynhurst (11-13th cent.) 
* Tyngehurst (14th cent.) 
* Tingerst alias Fyngerst or Fingest (16-18th cent.) 

===Toponym===

* The wood or wooded hill where the assembly meet 

Fingest : (&quot; Ting..hurst, Tyn..hurst &quot; ) 11-13th cent. 

The name is a hybrid of Old Norse and Old English.

The first element &quot; &#x27; ting &#x27; &quot;or&quot; &#x27; tyn &#x27; &quot; is from Old Norse Þing - ( &quot; &#x27; thing&#x27; &quot; ) ( &quot; ” assembly place ” &quot; ).

The next element &quot; ” hurst ” &quot; is from Old English &quot; ” hyrst ” &quot; ( &quot; ” wood or wooded hill ” &quot; ).

==History==

The ancient parish of Fingest included Cadmore End to the north of the village, which became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1852.

The manor of Fingest anciently belonged to St Albans Abbey. In 1163 it was given to the bishop of Lincoln. The ghost of Henry Burghersh, 14th-century Bishop of Lincoln, is reputed to haunt the area. After this time it was used as the country residence for the Lincoln diocese until 1547 when it was seized by the Crown. It was then given two years later to the Duke of Somerset who exchanged it with a property belonging to Wells Cathedral. The manor is now privately owned.

The civil parish of Fingest, originally based on the ecclesiastical parish, was enlarged in 1934 by adding land from the parishes of West Wycombe, Great Marlow and Hambleden. As a result, Lane End became the largest settlement in the parish, and the parish was renamed Fingest and Lane End in 1937. In the 1980s the civil parish was abolished. The larger part became the parish of Lane End, and the village of Fingest was added to Hambleden parish.

Scenes of the period drama &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; were shot in Fingest in May 2013.

<text>64 (sixty-four) is the natural number following 63 and preceding 65.

== Mathematics ==
Sixty-four is the square of 8, the cube of 4, and the sixth power of 2. It is the seventeenth interprime, since it lies midway between the eighteenth and nineteenth prime numbers (61, 67).

The aliquot sum of a power of two (2&quot;n&quot;) is always one less than the power of two itself, therefore the aliquot sum of 64 is 63, within an aliquot sequence of two composite members (64, 63, 41, 1, 0) that are rooted in the aliquot tree of the thirteenth prime, 41.

64 is:
*the smallest number with exactly seven divisors,
*the first whole number (greater than one) that is both a perfect square, and a perfect cube,
*the lowest positive power of two that is not adjacent to either a Mersenne prime or a Fermat prime,
*the fourth superperfect number — a number such that σ(σ(&quot;n&quot;)) = 2&quot;n&quot;,
*the sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function for the first fourteen integers,
*the number of graphs on four labeled nodes,
*the index of Graham&#x27;s number in the rapidly growing sequence 3↑↑↑↑3, 3 ↑ 3, …
*the number of vertices in a 6-cube,
*the fourth dodecagonal number,
*and the seventh centered triangular number.

Since it is possible to find sequences of 65 consecutive integers (intervals of length 64) such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member, 64 is the seventh Erdős–Woods number.

In decimal, no integer added to the sum of its own digits yields 64; hence, 64 is the &quot;tenth&quot; self number.

In four dimensions, there are 64 uniform polychora aside from two infinite families of duoprisms and antiprismatic prisms, and 64 Bravais lattices.

<text>65 (sixty-five) is the natural number following 64 and preceding 66.

==In mathematics==

65 is the nineteenth distinct semiprime, (5.13); and the third of the form (5.q), where q is a higher prime.

65 has a prime aliquot sum of 19 within an aliquot sequence of one composite numbers (65,19,1,0) to the prime; as the first member&#x27; of the 19-aliquot tree.

It is an octagonal number. It is also a Cullen number. Given 65, the Mertens function returns 0.

This number is the magic constant of a 5x5 normal magic square:

formula_1

This number is also the magic constant of n-Queens Problem for n = 5.

65 is the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two distinct positive squares in two (or more) ways, 65 = 82 + 12 = 72 + 42.

It appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 28, 37, 49 (it is the sum of the first two of these).

65 is a Stirling number of the second kind, the number of ways of dividing a set of six objects into four non-empty subsets.

65 = 15 + 24 + 33 + 42 + 51.

65 is the length of the hypotenuse of 4 different Pythagorean triangles, the lowest number to have more than 2: 652 = 162 + 632 = 332 + 562 = 392 + 522 = 252 + 602. The first two are &quot;primitive&quot;, and 65 is the lowest number to be the largest side of more than one such triple.

65 is the number of compositions of 11 into distinct parts.

==In other fields==
* the traditional age for retirement in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Canada, and several other countries.
**in the U.S., the age at which a person is eligible to obtain Medicare.
*65 is commonly used in names of many dishes of South India cuisine, for instance Chicken 65.
*A 65th anniversary is sometimes referred to as a sapphire jubilee.

<doc id="403323" wikidata="Q2792042" url="?curid=403323" title="Fleet Marston">
<text>Fleet Marston is a civil parish and deserted medieval village in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England, about northwest of the centre of Aylesbury. The parish measures about north – south, but east – west it is nowhere more than about wide. It is bounded to the southeast by the River Thame, to the east by a stream that joins the Thame, and to the west by field boundaries. It has an area of .

The A41 main road between Aylesbury and Waddesdon runs through the middle of the parish. Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station is on the A41 road, just outside the parish&#x27;s eastern boundary.

In 2010 the Office for National Statistics estimated the parish population to be 47. The 2011 Census included its population in that of the civil parish of Waddesdon.

In 2022 HS2 archaeologists discovered a Roman cemetery, and exhumed about 425 bodies including 40 decapitated skeletons. 1,200 coins were also discovered.

==Archaeology==
The course of the former Akeman Street Roman road passes northwest – southeast through the parish. A &quot;heavy scatter of Roman pottery&quot; has been found in the parish on the course of the former road, indicating the site of a former Romano-British settlement.

Excavations carried out between 2007 and 2016 uncovered evidence for a late prehistoric territorial boundary, a middle Iron Age settlement and the agricultural hinterland of the putative nucleated Roman settlement of Fleet Marston. The latter included a &quot;remarkable collection&quot; of organic finds, included four hen&#x27;s eggs (one of which survived excavation intact), leather shoes, wooden tools and a basketry tray made of woven oak bands and willow rods, in addition to evidence of malting and brewing, other roadside trades and crafts, burials and a possible pyre site.

===HS2 excavations, 2022===
In 2022 a large Roman cemetery was discovered by the HS2 archaeologists, who exhumed about 425 bodies including 40 decapitated skeletons. The bodies may have been ‘criminals’ or ‘outcasts’. 1,200 coins were also discovered.

==Toponym==
The toponym &quot;Marston&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;marsh farm&quot;. The prefix &quot;Fleet&quot; refers to the stream along eastern side of the parish, and was added to distinguish the village from nearby North Marston. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Mersetone&quot;. In the 13th century the village name was recorded as &quot;Flettemerstone&quot;.
==Parish church==
The oldest parts of St Mary&#x27;s parish church are 12th-century. There are records of parish rectors from 1223 onwards. The baptismal font may be 13th-century and the present chancel arch and north porch were added in the 14th century. One of the windows is 15th-century.

Parish registers from 1630 onwards survive. John Wesley is known to have preached his first sermon at Fleet Marston shortly after his ordination as deacon in 1725. The building was restored in 1868–69 under the direction of George Gilbert Scott. It is now a Grade II* listed building. It is also a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

==Economic and social history==
Some buildings in the village, including Fleet Marston Farm, are 17th-century. The manor house referred to below stood near the church, and was demolished in 1772. In 1806 Daniel and Samuel Lysons described Fleet Marston in their &quot;Magna Britannia&quot;:

&quot;FLEET-MARSTON, in the hundred of Ashendon and deanery of Waddesdon, lies about three miles from Aylesbury, on the road to Bicester. The manor, which was for many years in the Lees, has been lately purchased of their representative, Lord Dillon, by James Dupré esq. of Wilton Park. The advowson of the rectory being then the property of John Tirrel-Morin esq. was advertised for sale in the month of May 1805.&quot;

By 1851 the parish was in decline. The religious census of 1851 recorded its population as 30, with just eight attending church on Sunday 30 March. By 1871 the population had fallen to 23, living in five houses.

Little remains of the village today. In the south of the parish is the farm at Putlowes and Putlowes Cottages just to the southwest of the A41 road. In the centre of the parish, just northeast of the A41 are some smaller farms and St Mary&#x27;s church. In the north of the parish are Fleet Marston Farm, Fleet Marston Cottages and Lower Fleetmarston Farm. The latter can be reached only via Berryfields Road in adjoining Quarrendon parish (another deserted village).

===Railway===
The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway was built through the parish in the 1860s and opened in 1868. The Metropolitan Railway took it over in 1891 and opened Waddesdon railway station about northwest of Fleet Marston in 1897. The line became part of the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway in 1906.

Waddesdon station was closed in 1936. British Railways withdrew passenger services in 1963 and later reduced the line to single track.

However, in 2011 Chiltern Railways opened Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station where the line crosses the A41 road, just outside the eastern boundary of the parish. The station has an hourly service to London Marylebone via .

<text>A spreader bar is an article of bondage equipment usually consisting of a metal or wooden bar, with attachment points for bondage cuffs at each end, which can be fastened to wrists, ankles or knees to hold them apart. They are used in bondage play, and sometimes in bedroom bondage, usually in association with other bondage equipment. 

When applied to the wrists, a bar keeps the arms spread away from the body, providing an unimpeded access to the subject&#x27;s torso. When applied to the ankles or between the knees, it immobilizes the subject by preventing all but the most awkward walking, and keeping the legs spread to allow unimpeded access to the subject&#x27;s groin and trunk. If bars are applied between the knees and between the ankles, the subject may be forced to bend their knees, making walking even harder. A pair of bars may hold the subject in a spreadeagle position. 

The bar may be attached solely to the subject, or it may be attached to a piece of furniture, the floor or a device for suspension bondage. Homemade versions can be made from dowels, bamboo rods, or closet poles.

<text>Ford is a hamlet in the parish of Dinton-with-Ford and Upton, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the south eastern corner of the parish.

The place name is Anglo Saxon in origin and refers simply to the place where a stream crosses the main road via a ford.

The 16th Century pub in Ford, previously closed but now reopened under new ownership, is named after The Dinton Hermit. As well as being an old coaching inn on the main route between Aylesbury and Thame, it is one of several Grade II listed buildings in Ford. The barn, now converted into hotel bedrooms, is built mostly of witchert - a local material.

Every Wednesday and Friday morning at 10:30 a bus runs from the Dinton Hermit crossroads into Aylesbury, returning at approximately 13:30.

Ford has a main road which comes from a crossroad on the Ford Road (Which runs from Hartwell to Haddenham) It continues to Dinton, Buckinghamshire in the North and Askett in the South. It has a crossroad where Water Lane and Chapel Road intersect with the main road.

<text>Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited was an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company that was incorporated in India in 1961 and remained an entity until 2014. The company went public in 1973. Ownership of Ranbaxy changed twice over the course of its history.

In 2008, Japanese pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo acquired a controlling share in Ranbaxy and in 2014, Sun Pharma acquired 100% of Ranbaxy in an all-stock deal. The Sun Pharma acquisition brought all new management to Ranbaxy, which had been laden with controversy . Sun is the world&#x27;s fifth largest specialty generic pharmaceutical company.

==History==

===Formation===
Ranbaxy was started by Ranbir Singh and Gurbax Singh in 1937 as a distributor for Japanese company Shionogi. The name Ranbaxy blends the names of its founders: Ranbir and Gurbax. Bhai Mohan Singh bought the company in 1952 from his cousins Ranbir and Gurbax. After Bhai Mohan Singh&#x27;s son Parvinder Singh joined the company in 1967, the company saw an increase in scale.

In the late 1990s, Ranbaxy formed a US company, Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc., in order to support its entry into the pharmaceutical market in United States.

===Trading===
For the twelve months ending on 31 December 2005, the company&#x27;s global sales were US$1,178 million, with overseas markets accounting for 75% of global sales (USA: 28%, Europe: 17%, Brazil, Russia, and China: 29%).

In December 2005, Ranbaxy&#x27;s share price was hit by a patent ruling disallowing production of its own version of Pfizer&#x27;s cholesterol-cutting drug Lipitor, which had annual sales of more than $10 billion. 

In June 2008, Ranbaxy settled the patent dispute with Pfizer, allowing them to sell atorvastatin calcium, the generic version of Lipitor and atorvastatin calcium-amlodipine besylate, the generic version of Pfizer&#x27;s Caduet, in the US, starting on 30 November 2011.

On 23 June 2006, the US Food &amp; Drug Administration granted Ranbaxy a 180-day exclusivity period to sell simvastatin (Zocor) in the US as a generic drug at 80 mg strength. Ranbaxy competed with the maker of brand-name Zocor, Merck &amp; Co.; IVAX Corporation (which was acquired by and merged into Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.), which has 180-day exclusivity at strengths other than 80  mg; and Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories and India, whose authorized generic version (licensed by Merck) is exempt from exclusivity.

On 1 December 2011, Ranbaxy got approval from the FDA to launch the generic version of Lipitor in the United States after the drug&#x27;s patent expired.

=== Acquisition by Daiichi Sankyo ===

In June 2008, Daiichi Sankyo acquired a 34.8% stake in Ranbaxy from the family of CEO and Managing Director Malvinder Mohan Singh for  10,000 crore (US$2.4 billion) at 737 per share.

In November 2008, Daiichi-Sankyo completed the takeover of the company from the founding Singh family in a deal worth $4.6 billion by acquiring a 63.92% stake in Ranbaxy. Ranbaxy&#x27;s Malvinder Singh remained as CEO after the transaction.
The addition of Ranbaxy Laboratories extended Daiichi-Sankyo&#x27;s operations, with the combined company worth about US$30 billion.

In 2009, it was reported that former Novartis Senior Vice-President Yugal Sikri would lead the Indian operations of Ranbaxy Laboratories.

In 2011, Ranbaxy Global Consumer Health Care received the OTC Company of the year award. 

In 2012, 2013, and 2014 Brand Trust Reports, Ranbaxy was ranked 161st, 225th, and 184th respectively among India&#x27;s most trusted brands.

=== Acquisition by Sun Pharmaceutical ===

On 7 April 2014, India-based Sun Pharmaceutical and Japan-based Daiichi Sankyo jointly announced the sale of the entire 63.4% share of Ranbaxy from Daiichi Sankyo to Sun Pharmaceutical in a $4 billion all-share deal. Under these agreements, shareholders of Ranbaxy were to receive a 0.8 share of Sun Pharmaceutical for each share of Ranbaxy. After this acquisition, the partner Daiichi-Sankyo was to hold a stake of 9% in Sun Pharmaceutical.

== Controversies ==
During 2004–2005, Dinesh Thakur and Rajinder Kumar, two Indian employees at Ranbaxy, blew the whistle on Ranbaxy&#x27;s fabrication of drug test reports. Thakur&#x27;s office computer was soon found to have been compromised. Ranbaxy then accused Thakur of visiting pornographic sites using his office computer, forcing him to resign in 2005. Thakur left India for the United States and contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which started investigating his claims. As a result, on 16 September 2008, the Food and Drug Administration issued two warning letters to Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and an Import Alert for generic drugs produced by two manufacturing plants in India.

By 25 February 2009, the FDA said it had halted reviews of all drug applications, including data developed at Ranbaxy&#x27;s Paonta Sahib plant in India, because of a practice of falsified data and test results in approved and pending drug applications.

On 8 February 2012, three batches of the proton-pump inhibitor pantoprazole were recalled in the Netherlands due to the presence of impurities.

On 9 November 2012, Ranbaxy halted production and recalled 41 lots of atorvastatin due to glass particles being found in some bottles. Also in 2012, an apparent dosage mistake was reported in which 20 mg tablets were found in a bottle of atorvastatin labeled as containing 10 mg tablets; this led in 2014 to the voluntary recall in the United States of some 64,000 bottles.

In May 2013, Ranbaxy pleaded guilty and paid $500 million in fines, for felony charges relating to the manufacture and distribution of certain adulterated drugs made at two of Ranbaxy&#x27;s manufacturing facilities in India, and misrepresenting clinical generic drug data. Ranbaxy pleaded guilty to three felony FDCA counts, and four felony counts of knowingly making materially false statements to the FDA. Included in the adulterated products were antiretroviral (ARV) drugs destined for treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa.

In September 2013, further problems were reported, including apparent human hair in a tablet, oil spots on other tablets, toilet facilities without running water, and a failure to instruct employees to wash their hands after using the toilet. Ranbaxy was prohibited from manufacturing FDA-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility until it complied with United States drug manufacturing requirements.

In 2014, The FDA notified Ranbaxy Laboratories, Ltd., that it was prohibited from manufacturing and distributing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from its facility in Toansa, India, for FDA-regulated drug products. The FDA&#x27;s inspection of the Toansa facility, which concluded on 11 January 2014, identified significant CGMP violations. These included Toansa staff retesting raw materials, intermediate drug products, and finished API after those items failed analytical testing and specifications, in order to produce acceptable findings, and subsequently not reporting or investigating these failures.

In 2019 author Katherine Eban published &quot;Bottle of Lies&quot;, an in-depth investigation of Ranbaxy. In addition to the incidents described above, Eban describes internal struggles within the FDA as investigators who might have shut down Ranbaxy were overruled due to pressure to increase the supply of cheap generic drugs.

<text>68 (sixty-eight) is the natural number following 67 and preceding 69. It is an even number.

68 is a composite number and the eighth square-prime.

==In mathematics==
68 is a composite number; a square-prime, of the form (&quot;p&quot;2, q) where q is a higher prime. It is the eighth of this form and the sixth of the form (22.q).

68 is a Perrin number.

It has an aliquot sum of 58 within an aliquot sequence of two composite numbers (68, 58,32,31,1,0) to the Prime in the 31-aliquot tree.

It is the largest known number to be the sum of two primes in exactly two different ways: 68 = 7 + 61 = 31 + 37. All higher even numbers that have been checked are the sum of three or more pairs of primes; the conjecture that 68 is the largest number with this property is closely related to the Goldbach conjecture and, like it, remains unproven.

Because of the factorization of 68 as , a 68-sided regular polygon may be constructed with compass and straightedge.
There are exactly 68 10-bit binary numbers in which each bit has an adjacent bit with the same value, exactly 68 combinatorially distinct triangulations of a given triangle with four points interior to it, and exactly 68 intervals in the Tamari lattice describing the ways of parenthesizing five items. The largest graceful graph on 14 nodes has exactly 68 edges. There are 68 different undirected graphs with six edges and no isolated nodes, 68 different minimally 2-connected graphs on seven unlabeled nodes, 68 different degree sequences of four-node connected graphs, and 68 matroids on four labeled elements.

Størmer&#x27;s theorem proves that, for every number &quot;p&quot;, there are a finite number of pairs of consecutive numbers that are both &quot;p&quot;-smooth (having no prime factor larger than &quot;p&quot;). For &quot;p&quot; = 13 this finite number is exactly 68. On an infinite chessboard, there are 68 squares that are three knight&#x27;s moves away from any starting square.

As a decimal number, 68 is the last two-digit number to appear for the first time in the digits of pi. It is a happy number, meaning that repeatedly summing the squares of its digits eventually leads to 1:
:68 → 6 + 8 = 100 → 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.

==Other uses==
*In the restaurant industry, 68 may be used as a code meaning &quot;put back on the menu&quot;, being the opposite of 86 which means &quot;remove from the menu&quot;.
*68 may also be used as slang for oral sex, based on a play on words involving the number 69.

==History==

===1959–1973===
SAIL traces its origin to the Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL) which was set up on 19 January 1954. It was initially designed to manage only one plant that was coming up at Rourkela.

For Bhilai and Durgapur Steel Plants, the preliminary work was done by the Iron and Steel Ministry. From April 1957, the supervision and control of these two steel plants were also transferred to Hindustan Steel. The registered office was originally in New Delhi. It moved to Calcutta in July 1956, and ultimately to Ranchi in December 1959.

A new steel company, Bokaro Steel Limited (Bokaro Steel Plant), was incorporated on 29 January 1964 to construct and operate the steel plant at Bokaro. The 1 MT phases of Bhilai and Rourkela Steel Plants were completed by the end of December 1961. The 1 MT phase of Durgapur Steel Plant was completed in January 2008.

After commissioning of the Wheel and Axle plant. The crude steel production of HSL went up from 1.58 MT (1959–60) to 1.6 MT. The second phase of the Bhilai Steel Plant was completed in September 1967 after commissioning of the Wire Rod Mill. The last unit of the 1.8 MT phase of Rourkela – the Tandem Mill – was commissioned in February 1968, and the 1.6 MT stage of Durgapur Steel Plant was completed in August 1969 after commissioning of the Furnace in SMS. Thus, with the completion of the 2.5 MT stage at Bhilai, 1.8 MT at Rourkela, and 1.6 MT at Durgapur, the total crude steel production capacity of HSL was raised to 3.7 MT in 1968–69 and subsequently to 4 MT in 1972–73. IISCO was taken over as a subsidiary in 1978 and later merged in 2006.

The hot metal production capacity of the company will further increase and is expected to reach a level of 50 million tonnes per annum by 2025. 

===Holding Company===
The Ministry formulated a policy statement to revamp industry management, presented to Parliament on 2 December 1972. This initiative proposed creating a holding company to oversee both inputs and outputs. Thus, The Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) was established on 24 January 1973, with an authorized capital of ₹2,000 crore (US$250 million). SAIL&#x27;s mandate included managing five integrated steel plants and two specialty plants. In 1978, SAIL underwent restructuring to function as an operating company.

The party was created as a breakout faction from the Ennahda movement, after that party opted for cooperation with Algeria&#x27;s government. Party leader Abdallah Djaballah then left to found and lead the more radically oppositional el-Islah.

At the 2007 elections, the party was badly defeated. It received only 2.53% of the vote and 3 seats.

<doc id="403354" wikidata="Q1889454" url="?curid=403354" title="Movement of Society for Peace">
<text>The Movement of Society for Peace () is a Sunni Islamist party in Algeria, led by Mahfoud Nahnah until his death in 2003. Its current leader is Abderrazak Makri. It is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.

== Roots in the Muslim Brotherhood ==
The Muslim Brotherhood reached Algeria during the later years of the French colonial presence in the country (1830–1962). Sheikh Ahmad Sahnoun led the organization in Algeria between 1953 and 1954 during the French colonialism. Brotherhood members and sympathizers took part in the uprising against France in 1954-1962, but the movement was marginalized during the FLN one-party rule which was installed at independence in 1962. Islamic forces however remained active in religious education, mosques and religious associations, including sympathizers of the Muslim Brotherhood. Brotherhood activists generally refrained from confronting the regime, which did not tolerate independent opposition, but sometimes protested the government and generally argued for a greater role for Islam in the country&#x27;s politics. Muslims also called for increased Arabization of education and the state bureaucracy, and gained a foothold through heavy state backing for the early Arabization programs under Presidents Ahmed Ben Bella and Houari Boumédiène. The reformist-Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, in particular, was strengthened through the recruitment of Arabic language teachers from other Arab countries, particularly Egypt, which is the Brotherhood&#x27;s main stronghold.

== History of the party ==
When a multi-party system was introduced in Algeria in the early 1990s, the Muslim Brotherhood formed the Movement for the Society of Peace (MSP), led by Mahfoud Nahnah until his death in 2003 (he was succeeded by present party leader Boudjerra Soltani). The party was initially known as the &quot;Movement for the Islamic Society&quot;, but following legal bans on religiously founded parties, the name was changed.

A dissident wing of Brotherhood-inspired Islamists led by Abdallah Djaballah formed their own party, El Nahda, which later split to create El Islah, advocating a more hardline stand towards the government. (Neither is supported by the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s international organization, which recognizes MSP as its Algerian wing.) The Muslim Brotherhood in Algeria did not join the Front islamique du salut (FIS), which emerged as the leading Islamist group in the 1990 local and 1991 parliamentary elections, although the rapidly growing FIS did attract some of its supporters.

In 1992, a military coup d&#x27;état cancelled elections which the FIS was on the verge of winning, and banned the organization. The Brotherhood condemned the coup, but refused to join the resulting violent uprising by FIS sympathizers and the Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) against the Algerian state and military. Instead, the group urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict and cooperation with the state, which for a time caused some strains with the international Muslim Brotherhood, where many sympathized with the Islamist insurgency.

The MSP thus remained a legal political organization, and ran in all elections organized by the state while the ex-FIS and other rebel forces urged a boycott. In retaliation for the party&#x27;s pro-government stance, several members were assassinated by extremist militants during the war. Since 1997, the party has been supportive of the presidencies of Liamine Zeroual and Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and has participated in government.

In parliament and government, the party has tried to strengthen conservative and Islamic trends in state and society, e.g. in opposing secularizing changes in the Algerian Family Code. It has argued in favor of amnesty and reconciliation efforts towards former Islamist guerrillas, while simultaneously condemning violence and supporting the state in its confrontation with radical groups still fighting, such as al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (formerly GSPC).

== Electoral participation ==

In the first round of the 1991 parliamentary elections (Algeria&#x27;s first multi-party elections), the MSP gained 5,3% of the popular vote, becoming the fourth-largest party in parliament. The movement was significantly weaker than the non-Brotherhood FIS, which became the largest party with 47%. The second round of elections were cancelled by a military coup in January 1992, and the FIS was banned.

===During the civil war ===

The MSP protested the coup, but also clearly condemned the Islamist insurgency that ensued. The party remained committed to the political process, arguing in favor of peaceful reconciliation, an amnesty for Islamist fighters and a return to democracy, while criticizing both sides of the conflict. In 1995, Sheikh Nahnah participated in the presidential elections as main contender against the military-backed winning candidate, Liamine Zeroual. He finished second with 25.38% of the popular vote.

In the 1997 parliamentary elections, the party gained 14.8% of the vote, finishing as the second-largest party in parliament., and subsequently joining the pro-Zeroual governing coalition under leadership of the RND.

=== Presidential alliance under Bouteflika ===
The party would later support Zeroual&#x27;s successor as president from 1999, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. In the first parliamentary elections under Bouteflika, the MSP received 7% of the vote in the 2002 elections, gaining 38 members in the parliament. In the 2004 presidential elections, the party endorsed and were part of a coalition supporting the reelection of Bouteflika, and it has remained committed to the three-party &quot;presidential coalition&quot; (together with the secular FLN and the RND parties). As part of the presidential coalition, the party has argued for conservative values and the Islamization of society, as well as supported Bouteflika&#x27;s projects to grant amnesty to former Islamist militants.

In the 2007 parliamentary elections, the MSP again ran as a member of the presidential bloc, earning 10% of the popular vote and becoming the third-largest party of the parliament, with 51 seats. The party further supported constitutional changes in 2008, designed to allow President Bouteflika to run for a third term. Rather than launching its own candidate, it campaigned in favor of Bouteflika&#x27;s candidacy in the 2009 presidential election.

=== Green Algeria Alliance ===
In 2012, it however turned to founding the Islamist coalition Green Algeria Alliance, together with Islah and Nahda. Jointly participating in the 2012 legislative election, the three Islamist parties had to suffer losses achieving only 6.22% of the popular vote and 49 seats. On 25 January 2014, the MSP announced to boycott the 2014 presidential election.

The party did not participate in the 2019 presidential election. A former member of the party, former Tourism Minister Abdelkader Bengrina, started his own party, the &quot;el-Bina&quot;, and received 1.5 million votes, or 17.4%, on a turnout of 40%.

<text>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflicts. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India&#x27;s aviation service during World War II with the prefix &quot;Royal&quot;. After India gained independence from United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of the Dominion of India. With the transition to a republic in 1950, the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was removed.

Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF&#x27;s mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.

The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF. , 135,000 personnel are in service with the Indian Air Force. The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002, Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.

==Mission==
The IAF&#x27;s mission is defined by the Armed Forces Act of 1947, the Constitution of India, and the Air Force Act of 1950. It decrees that in the aerial battlespace:
Defence of India and every part there of including preparation for defence and all such acts as may be conducive in times of war to its prosecution and after its termination to effective demobilisation.

* The Primary objective of IAF is to defend the nation and its airspace against Air threats in coordination with Army and Navy.
* The secondary purpose is to assist civil power during natural calamities and internal disturbances.
* The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops in the battlefield and also provides strategic and tactical airlift capabilities.
* IAF also provides strategic air lift or secondary Airlift for the Indian Army.
* The IAF also operates the Integrated Space Cell together with the other two branches of the Indian Armed Forces, the Department of Space and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
* Rescue of civilians during natural disasters
* Evacuation of Indian nationals from foreign countries in case of instability or other problems

In practice, this is taken as a directive meaning the IAF bears the responsibility of safeguarding Indian airspace and thus furthering national interests in conjunction with the other branches of the armed forces. The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops on the battlefield as well as strategic and tactical airlift capabilities. The Integrated Space Cell is operated by the Indian Armed Forces, the civilian Department of Space, and the Indian Space Research Organisation. By uniting the civilian run space exploration organisations and the military faculty under a single Integrated Space Cell the military is able to efficiently benefit from innovation in the civilian sector of space exploration, and the civilian departments benefit as well.

The Indian Air Force, with highly trained crews, pilots, and access to modern military assets provides India with the capacity to provide rapid response evacuation, search-and-rescue (SAR) operations, and delivery of relief supplies to affected areas via cargo aircraft. The IAF provided extensive assistance to relief operations during natural calamities such as the Gujarat cyclone in 1998, the tsunami in 2004, and North India floods in 2013. The IAF has also undertaken relief missions such as Operation Rainbow in Sri Lanka.

==History==


===Formation and early pilots===

The Indian Air Force was established on 8 October 1932 in British India as an auxiliary air force of the Royal Air Force. The enactment of the Indian Air Force Act 1932 stipulated out their auxiliary status and enforced the adoption of the Royal Air Force uniforms, badges, brevets and insignia. On 1 April 1933, the IAF commissioned its first squadron, No.1 Squadron, with four Westland Wapiti biplanes and five Indian pilots. The Indian pilots were led by British RAF Commanding officer Flight Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) Cecil Bouchier.

===World War II (1939–1945)===
During World War II, the IAF played an instrumental role in halting the advance of the Japanese army in Burma, where the first IAF air strike was executed. The target for this first mission was the Japanese military base in Arakan, after which IAF strike missions continued against the Japanese airbases at Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in northern Thailand.

The IAF was mainly involved in strike, close air support, aerial reconnaissance, bomber escort and pathfinding missions for RAF and USAAF heavy bombers. RAF and IAF pilots would train by flying with their non-native air wings to gain combat experience and communication proficiency. Besides operations in the Burma Theatre IAF pilots participated in air operations in North Africa and Europe.

In addition to the IAF, many native Indians and some 200 Indians resident in Britain volunteered to join the RAF and Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force. One such volunteer was Sergeant Shailendra Eknath Sukthankar, who served as a navigator with No. 83 Squadron. Sukthankar was commissioned as an officer, and on 14 September 1943, received the DFC. Squadron Leader Sukthankar eventually completed 45 operations, 14 of them on board the RAF Museum&#x27;s Avro Lancaster R5868. Another volunteer was Assistant Section Officer Noor Inayat Khan a Muslim pacifist and Indian nationalist who joined the WAAF, in November 1940, to fight against Nazism. Noor Khan served bravely as a secret agent with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in France, but was eventually betrayed and captured. Many of these Indian airmen were seconded or transferred to the expanding IAF such as Squadron Leader Mohinder Singh Pujji DFC who led No. 4 Squadron IAF in Burma.

During the war, the IAF experienced a phase of steady expansion. New aircraft added to the fleet included the US-built Vultee Vengeance, Douglas Dakota, the British Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, and Westland Lysander.

In recognition of the valiant service by the IAF, King George VI conferred the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in 1945. Thereafter the IAF was referred to as the &quot;Royal Indian Air Force&quot;. In 1950, when India became a republic, the prefix was dropped and it reverted to being the Indian Air Force.

===First years of independence (1947–1950)===

After it became independent from the British Empire in 1947, British India was partitioned into the new states of the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. Along the lines of the geographical partition, the assets of the air force were divided between the new countries. India&#x27;s air force retained the name of the Royal Indian Air Force, but three of the ten operational squadrons and facilities, located within the borders of Pakistan, were transferred to the Royal Pakistan Air Force. The RIAF Roundel was changed to an interim &#x27;Chakra&#x27; roundel derived from the Ashoka Chakra.

Around the same time, conflict broke out between them over the control of the princely state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. With Pakistani forces moving into the state, its Maharaja decided to accede to India in order to receive military help. The day after, the Instrument of Accession was signed, the RIAF was called upon to transport troops into the war zone. And this was when a good management of logistics came into help. This led to the eruption of full-scale war between India and Pakistan, though there was no formal declaration of war. During the war, the RIAF did not engage the Pakistan Air Force in air-to-air combat; however, a couple of IAF Hawker Tempest fighters did intercept a Pakistani Douglas DC-3 transport aircraft &amp; tried to shoot it down but the pilot of the DC-3 (Mukhtar Ahmad Dogar) managed to evade the fighters. Other than that, it also provided effective transport and close air support to the Indian troops.

When India became a republic in 1950, the prefix &#x27;Royal&#x27; was dropped from the Indian Air Force. At the same time, the current IAF roundel was adopted.

===Congo crisis and Annexation of Goa (1960–1961)===
The IAF saw significant conflict in 1960, when Belgium&#x27;s 75-year rule over Congo ended abruptly, engulfing the nation in widespread violence and rebellion. The IAF activated No. 5 Squadron, equipped with English Electric Canberra, to support the United Nations Operation in the Congo. The squadron started undertaking operational missions in November. The unit remained there until 1966, when the UN mission ended. Operating from Leopoldville and Kamina, the Canberras soon destroyed the rebel Air Force and provided the UN ground forces with its only long-range air support force.

In late 1961, the Indian government decided to attack the Portuguese colony of Goa after years of disagreement between New Delhi and Lisbon. The Indian Air Force was requested to provide support elements to the ground force in what was called Operation Vijay. Probing flights by some fighters and bombers were carried out from 8–18 December to draw out the Portuguese Air Force, but to no avail. On 18 December, two waves of Canberra bombers bombed the runway of Dabolim airfield taking care not to bomb the Terminals and the ATC tower. Two Portuguese transport aircraft (a Super Constellation and a DC-6) found on the airfield were left alone so that they could be captured intact. However the Portuguese pilots managed to take off the aircraft from the still damaged airfield and made their getaway to Portugal. Hunters attacked the wireless station at Bambolim. Vampires were used to provide air support to the ground forces. In Daman, Mystères were used to strike Portuguese gun positions. Ouragans (called Toofanis in the IAF) bombed the runways at Diu and destroyed the control tower, wireless station and the meteorological station. After the Portuguese surrendered the former colony was integrated into India.

===Border disputes and changes in the IAF (1962–1971)===
In 1962, border disagreements between China and India escalated to a war when China mobilised its troops across the Indian border. During the Sino-Indian War, India&#x27;s military planners failed to deploy and effectively use the IAF against the invading Chinese forces. This resulted in India losing a significant amount of advantage to the Chinese; especially in Jammu and Kashmir.

On 24 April 1965, an Indian Ouragan strayed over the Pakistani border and was forced to land by a Pakistani Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, the pilot was returned to India; however, the captured aircraft would be kept by the Pakistan Air Force(PAF) and ended up being displayed at the PAF museum in Peshawar.

Three years after the Sino-Indian conflict, in 1965, Pakistan launched Operation Gibraltar, strategy of Pakistan to infiltrate Jammu and Kashmir, and start a rebellion against Indian rule. This came to be known as the Second Kashmir War. This was the first time the IAF actively engaged an enemy air force. However, instead of providing close air support to the Indian Army, the IAF carried out independent raids against PAF bases. These bases were situated deep inside Pakistani territory, making IAF fighters vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. During the course of the conflict, the PAF enjoyed technological superiority over the IAF and had achieved substantial strategic and tactical advantage due to the suddenness of the attack and advanced state of their air force. The IAF was restrained by the government from retaliating to PAF attacks in the eastern sector while a substantive part of its combat force was deployed there and could not be transferred to the western sector, against the possibility of Chinese intervention. Moreover, international (UN) stipulations and norms did not permit military force to be introduced into the Indian state of J&amp;K beyond what was agreed during the 1949 ceasefire. Despite this, the IAF was able to prevent the PAF from gaining air superiority over conflict zones. The small and nimble IAF Folland Gnats proved effective against the F-86 Sabres of the PAF earning it the nickname &quot;Sabre Slayers&quot;. By the time the conflict had ended, the IAF lost 60–70 aircraft, while the PAF lost 43 aircraft. More than 60% of IAF&#x27;s aircraft losses took place in ground attack missions to enemy ground-fire, since fighter-bomber aircraft would carry out repeated dive attacks on the same target. According to, Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh of the Indian Air Force, despite having been qualitatively inferior, IAF achieved air superiority in three days in the 1965 War.

After the 1965 war, the IAF underwent a series of changes to improve its capabilities. In 1966, the Para Commandos regiment was created. To increase its logistics supply and rescue operations ability, the IAF inducted 72 HS 748s which were built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under licence from Avro. India started to put more stress on indigenous manufacture of fighter aircraft. As a result, HAL HF-24 Marut, designed by the famed German aerospace engineer Kurt Tank, were inducted into the air force. HAL also started developing an improved version of the Folland Gnat, known as HAL Ajeet. At the same time, the IAF also started inducting Mach 2 capable Soviet MiG-21 and Sukhoi Su-7 fighters.

===Bangladesh Liberation War (1971)===

By late 1971, the intensification of the independence movement in East Pakistan lead to the Bangladesh Liberation War between India and Pakistan. On 22 November 1971, 10 days before the start of a full-scale war, four PAF F-86 Sabre jets attacked Indian and Mukti Bahini positions at Garibpur, near the international border. Two of the four PAF Sabres were shot down and one damaged by the IAF&#x27;s Folland Gnats. On 3 December, India formally declared war against Pakistan following massive preemptive strikes by the PAF against Indian Air Force installations in Srinagar, Ambala, Sirsa, Halwara and Jodhpur. However, the IAF did not suffer significantly because the leadership had anticipated such a move and precautions were taken. The Indian Air Force was quick to respond to Pakistani air strikes, following which the PAF carried out mostly defensive sorties.

Within the first two weeks, the IAF had carried out almost 12,000 sorties over East Pakistan and also provided close air support to the advancing Indian Army. IAF also assisted the Indian Navy in its operations against the Pakistani Navy in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. On the western front, the IAF destroyed more than 20 Pakistani tanks, 4 APCs and a supply train during the Battle of Longewala. The IAF undertook strategic bombing of West Pakistan by carrying out raids on oil installations in Karachi, the Mangla Dam and a gas plant in Sindh. Similar strategy was also deployed in East Pakistan and as the IAF achieved complete air superiority on the eastern front, the ordnance factories, runways, and other vital areas of East Pakistan were severely damaged. By the time Pakistani forces surrendered, the IAF destroyed 94 PAF Aircraft
The IAF was able to conduct a wide range of missions – troop support; air combat; deep penetration strikes; para-dropping behind enemy lines; feints to draw enemy fighters away from the actual target; bombing; and reconnaissance. In contrast, the Pakistan Air Force, which was solely focused on air combat, was blown out of the subcontinent&#x27;s skies within the first week of the war. Those PAF aircraft that survived took refuge at Iranian air bases or in concrete bunkers, refusing to offer a fight. Hostilities officially ended at 14:30 GMT on 17 December, after the fall of Dacca on 15 December. India claimed large gains of territory in West Pakistan (although pre-war boundaries were recognised after the war), and the independence of Pakistan&#x27;s East wing as Bangladesh was confirmed. The IAF had flown over 16,000 sorties on both East and West fronts; including sorties by transport aircraft and helicopters. while the PAF flew about 30 and 2,840. More than 80 per cent of the IAF&#x27;s sorties were close-support and interdiction, and according to neutral assessments about 45 IAF Aircraft were lost while, Pakistan lost 75 aircraft. Not including any F-6s, Mirage IIIs, or the six Jordanian F-104s which failed to return to their donors. But the imbalance in air losses was explained by the IAF&#x27;s considerably higher sortie rate, and its emphasis on ground-attack missions. On the ground Pakistan suffered most, with 9,000 killed and 25,000 wounded while India lost 3,000 dead and 12,000 wounded. The loss of armoured vehicles was similarly imbalanced. This represented a major defeat for Pakistan. Towards the end of the war, IAF&#x27;s transport planes dropped leaflets over Dhaka urging the Pakistani forces to surrender, demoralising Pakistani troops in East Pakistan.

===Incidents before Kargil (1984–1988)===

In 1984, India launched Operation Meghdoot to capture the Siachen Glacier in the contested Kashmir region. In Op Meghdoot, IAF&#x27;s Mi-8, Chetak and Cheetah helicopters airlifted hundreds of Indian troops to Siachen. Launched on 13 April 1984, this military operation was unique because of Siachen&#x27;s inhospitable terrain and climate. The military action was successful, given the fact that under a previous agreement, neither Pakistan nor India had stationed any personnel in the area. With India&#x27;s successful Operation Meghdoot, it gained control of the Siachen Glacier. India has established control over all of the long Siachen Glacier and all of its tributary glaciers, as well as the three main passes of the Saltoro Ridge immediately west of the glacier—Sia La, Bilafond La, and Gyong La. Pakistan controls the glacial valleys immediately west of the Saltoro Ridge. According to the &quot;TIME&quot; magazine, India gained more than of territory because of its military operations in Siachen.

Following the inability to negotiate an end to the Sri Lankan Civil War, and to provide humanitarian aid through an unarmed convoy of ships, the Indian Government decided to carry out an airdrop of the humanitarian supplies on the evening of 4 June 1987 designated Operation Poomalai (Tamil: Garland) or Eagle Mission 4. Five An-32s escorted by four Mirage 2000 of 7 Sqn AF, &#x27;The Battleaxes&#x27;, carried out the supply drop which faced no opposition from the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. Another Mirage 2000 orbited 150 km away, acting as an airborne relay of messages to the entire fleet since they would be outside radio range once they descended to low levels. The Mirage 2000 escort formation was led by Wg Cdr Ajit Bhavnani, with Sqn Ldrs Bakshi, NA Moitra and JS Panesar as his team members and Sqn Ldr KG Bewoor as the relay pilot. Sri Lanka accused India of &quot;blatant violation of sovereignty&quot;. India insisted that it was acting only on humanitarian grounds.

In 1987, the IAF supported the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in northern and eastern Sri Lanka in Operation Pawan. About 70,000 sorties were flown by the IAF&#x27;s transport and helicopter force in support of nearly 100,000 troops and paramilitary forces without a single aircraft lost or mission aborted. IAF An-32s maintained a continuous air link between air bases in South India and Northern Sri Lanka transporting men, equipment, rations and evacuating casualties. Mi-8s supported the ground forces and also provided air transportation to the Sri Lankan civil administration during the elections. Mi-25s of No. 125 Helicopter Unit were utilised to provide suppressive fire against militant strong points and to interdict coastal and clandestine riverine traffic.

On the night of 3 November 1988, the Indian Air Force mounted special operations to airlift a parachute battalion group from Agra, non-stop over to the remote Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives in response to Maldivian president Gayoom&#x27;s request for military help against a mercenary invasion in Operation Cactus. The IL-76s of No. 44 Squadron landed at Hulhule at 0030 hours and the Indian paratroopers secured the airfield and restored Government rule at Male within hours. Four Mirage 2000 aircraft of 7 Sqn, led by Wg Cdr AV &#x27;Doc&#x27; Vaidya, carried out a show of force early that morning, making low-level passes over the islands.

===Kargil War (1999)===
On 11 May 1999, the Indian Air Force was called in to provide close air support to the Indian Army at the height of the ongoing Kargil conflict with the use of helicopters. The IAF strike was code named Operation Safed Sagar. The first strikes were launched on 26 May, when the Indian Air Force struck infiltrator positions with fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships. The initial strikes saw MiG-27s carrying out offensive sorties, with MiG-21s and later MiG-29s providing fighter cover. The IAF also deployed its radars and the MiG-29 fighters in vast numbers to keep check on Pakistani military movements across the border. Srinagar Airport was at this time closed to civilian air-traffic and dedicated to the Indian Air Force.

On 27 May, the Indian Air Force suffered its first fatality when it lost a MiG-21 and a MiG-27 in quick succession. The following day, while on an offensive sortie, a Mi-17 was shot down by three Stinger missiles and lost its entire crew of four. Following these losses the IAF immediately withdrew helicopters from offensive roles as a measure against the threat of Man-portable air-defence systems (MANPAD). On 30 May, the Mirage 2000s were introduced in offensive capability, as they were deemed better in performance under the high-altitude conditions of the conflict zone. Mirage 2000s were not only better equipped to counter the MANPAD threat compared to the MiGs, but also gave IAF the ability to carry out aerial raids at night. The MiG-29s were used extensively to provide fighter escort to the Mirage 2000. Radar transmissions of Pakistani F-16s were picked up repeatedly, but these aircraft stayed away. The Mirages successfully targeted enemy camps and logistic bases in Kargil and severely disrupted their supply lines. Mirage 2000s were used for strikes on Muntho Dhalo and the heavily defended Tiger Hill and paved the way for their early recapture. At the height of the conflict, the IAF was conducting over forty sorties daily over the Kargil region. By 26 July, the Indian forces had successfully repulsed the Pakistani forces from Kargil.

===Post Kargil incidents (1999–present)===
Since the late 1990s, the Indian Air Force has been modernising its fleet to counter challenges in the new century. The fleet size of the IAF has decreased to 33 squadrons during this period because of the retirement of older aircraft. Still, India maintains the fourth largest air force in the world. The IAF plans to raise its strength to 42 squadrons. Self-reliance is the main aim that is being pursued by the defence research and manufacturing agencies.

On 10 August 1999, IAF MiG-21s intercepted a Pakistan Navy Breguet Atlantique which was flying over Sir Creek, a disputed territory. The aircraft was shot down killing all 16 Pakistani Navy personnel on board. India claimed that the Atlantic was on a mission to gather information on IAF air defence, a charge emphatically rejected by Pakistan which argued that the unarmed aircraft was on a training mission.

On 2 August 2002, the Indian Air Force bombed Pakistani posts along the Line of Control in the Kel sector, following inputs about Pakistani military buildup near the sector.

On 20 August 2013, the Indian Air Force created a world record by performing the highest landing of a C-130J at the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh at the height of . The medium-lift aircraft will be used to deliver troops, supplies and improve communication networks. The aircraft belonged to the &quot;Veiled Vipers&quot; squadron based at Hindon Air Force Station.

On 13 July 2014, two MiG-21s were sent from Jodhpur Air Base to investigate a Turkish Airlines aircraft over Jaisalmer when it repeated an identification code, provided by another commercial passenger plane that had already entered Indian airspace before it. The flights were on their way to Mumbai and Delhi, and the planes were later allowed to proceed after their credentials were verified.

====2019 Balakot airstrike====

Following heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after the 2019 Pulwama attack that was carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) which killed forty servicemen of the Central Reserve Police Force, a group of twelve Mirage 2000 fighter planes from the Indian Air Force carried out air strikes on alleged JeM bases in Chakothi and Muzaffarabad in the Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Furthermore, the Mirage 2000s targeted an alleged JeM training camp in Balakot, a town in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan claimed that the Indian aircraft had only dropped bombs in the forest area demolishing pine trees near the Jaba village which is away from Balakot
and Indian officials claimed to bomb and kill a large number of terrorists in the airstrike.

====2019 India–Pakistan standoff====

On 27 February 2019, in retaliation for the IAF bombing of an alleged terrorist hideout in Balakot, a group of PAF Mirage-5 and JF-17 fighters allegedly conducted an airstrike against certain ground targets across the Line of Control. They were intercepted by a group of IAF fighters consisting of Su-30MKI and MiG-21 jets. An ensuing dogfight began. According to India, one PAF F-16 was shot down by an IAF MiG-21 piloted by Abhinandan Varthaman, while Pakistan denied use of F-16s in the operation. According to Pakistan, a MiG-21 and a Su30MKI were shot down, while India claims that only the MiG-21 was shot down. Indian officials rejected Pakistani claims of shooting down an Su-30MKI stating that it&#x27;s impossible to hide an aircraft crash as of now in a populated area like Kashmir and said it&#x27;s a coverup for the loss of F16. While the downed MiG-21&#x27;s pilot had ejected successfully, he landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and was captured by the Pakistan military. Before his capture he was assaulted by a few locals. After a couple of days of captivity, the captured pilot was released by Pakistan per Third Geneva convention obligations. While Pakistan denied involvement of any of its F-16 aircraft in the strike, the IAF presented remnants of AMRAAM missiles that are only carried by the F-16s within the PAF as proof of their involvement. Unnamed US officials told &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine in April 2019 that an audit didn&#x27;t find any Pakistani F-16s missing. However, this was not confirmed by the United States, which cited it as bilateral matter between US and Pakistan. Various international military observers reject Indian claim of shooting down PAF F-16.

IAF also lost a MI-17 helicopter during Indo-Pakistan standoff 2019. On the same day of 27 February 2019, around twenty minutes before the MiG-21 downing, an Indian Mil Mi-17 helicopter crashed, killing six Indian Air Force personnel and one civilian in the Budgam district. It was under the command of squadron leaders Siddarth Vashista and Ninad Mandavgane and crashed within ten minutes of take-off from the Srinagar air base. Four other IAF personnel were flight engineer Vishal Kumar Pandey, sergeant Vikrant Sehrawat, corporals Deepak Pandey and Pankaj Kumars that were killed along with two pilots. In October 2019, IAF confirmed that the helicopter was shot down by an Indian SPYDER surface-to-air missile mistaking it as an PAF aircraft and said that five personnel were held guilty for the lapses. IAF dismissed Group Captain Suman Roy Choudhry Chief Operations Officer (COO) of the Srinagar Air Force Station from his service in 2023 for his negligence during PAF strikes.

==Structure==
The President of India is the Supreme Commander of all Indian armed forces and by virtue of that fact is the national Commander-in-chief of the Air Force. The Chief of the Air Staff with the rank of Air chief marshal is the Commander 

In January 2002, the government conferred the rank of Marshal of the Indian Air Force on Arjan Singh making him the first and only &quot;Five-star&quot; officer with the Indian Air Force and ceremonial chief of the air force.

===Commands===
The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two functional commands. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an operational command is to conduct military operations using aircraft within its area of responsibility, whereas the responsibility of functional commands is to maintain combat readiness. Aside from the Training Command at Bangalore, the primary flight training is done at the Air Force Academy (located in Hyderabad), followed by operational training at various other schools. Advanced officer training for command positions is also conducted at the Defence Services Staff College; specialised advanced flight training schools are located at Bidar, Karnataka and Hakimpet, Telangana (also the location for helicopter training). Technical schools are found at a number of other locations.

&quot;Note: + = Functional Command&quot;

===Wings===
A wing is a formation intermediate between a command and a squadron. It generally consists of two or three IAF squadrons and helicopter units, along with forward base support units (FBSU). FBSUs do not have or host any squadrons or helicopter units but act as transit airbases for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged air bases playing host to various squadrons. In all, about 47 wings and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF. Wings are typically commanded by an air commodore.

===Stations===

Within each operational command are anywhere from nine to sixteen bases or stations. Smaller than wings, but similarly organised, stations are static units commanded by a group captain. A station typically has one wing and one or two squadrons assigned to it.

===Squadrons and units===

Squadrons are the field units and formations attached to static locations. Thus, a flying squadron or unit is a sub-unit of an air force station which carries out the primary task of the IAF. A fighter squadron consists of 18 aircraft; all fighter squadrons are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of wing commander. Some transport squadrons and helicopter units are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of group captain.

===Flights===
Flights are sub-divisions of squadrons, commanded by a squadron leader. Each flight consists of two sections.

===Sections===
The smallest unit is the section, led by a flight lieutenant. Each section consists of three aircraft.

Within this formation structure, IAF has several service branches for day-to-day operations. They are:
===Garud Commando Force===
The Garud commandos are the special forces of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Their tasks include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, providing security to IAF&#x27;s vulnerably located assets and various air force-specific special operations. First conceived in 2002, this unit was officially established on February 6, 2004.

All Garuds are volunteers who are imparted a 52-week basic training, which includes a three-month probation followed by special operations training, basic airborne training and other warfare and survival skills. The last phase of basic training sees Garuds been deployed to get combat experience. Advanced training follows, which includes specialised weapons training.

The mandated tasks of the Garuds include direct action, special reconnaissance, rescuing downed pilots in hostile territory, establishing airbases in hostile territory and providing air-traffic control to these airbases. The Garuds also undertake suppression of enemy air defences and the destruction of other enemy assets such as radars, evaluation of the outcomes of Indian airstrikes and use laser designators to guide Indian airstrikes.

The security of IAF installations and assets are usually performed by the Air Force Police and the Defence Security Corps even though some critical assets are protected by the Garuds.

===Defence Space Agency===
The Defence Space Agency, an integrated tri-services agency, which draws its personnel from all the three services of the Indian armed forces, is set up to operate the space-warfare and Satellite Intelligence assets of India.

Unlike an aerospace command, where the air force controls most of its activities, the Defence Space Agency envisages co-operation and co-ordination between the three services as well as civilian agencies dealing with space.

India currently has 10 military satellites.

===Display teams===

&quot;The Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT)&quot; (&quot;Surya Kiran&quot; is Sanskrit for &quot;Sun Rays&quot;) is an aerobatics demonstration team of the Indian Air Force. They were formed in 1996 and are successors to the &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;. The team has a total of 13 pilots (selected from the fighter stream of the IAF) and operate 9 Bae Hawk mk.132 painted in a &quot;day-glo orange&quot; and white colour scheme. The Surya Kiran team were conferred squadron status in 2006, and presently have the designation of 52 Squadron (&quot;The Sharks&quot;). The team is based at the Indian Air Force Station at Bidar. The team earlier used to fly HAL HJT-16 Kiran.

&quot;Sarang&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;Peacock&quot;) is the Helicopter Display Team of the Indian Air Force. The team was formed in October 2003 and their first public performance was at the Asian Aerospace Show, Singapore, 2004. The team earlier used to fly four HAL Dhruvs but that was upgraded to five on the 91st Air Force day held in Prayagraj. The choppers are painted in red and white with a peacock figure at each side of the fuselage. The team is based at the Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore.

==Personnel==
Over the years reliable sources provided notably divergent estimates of the personnel strength of the Indian Air Force after analysing open-source intelligence. In 2006, Anthony Cordesman estimated that strength to be 170,000 in the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) publication &quot;The Asian Conventional Military Balance in 2006&quot;. In 2010, James Hackett revised that estimate to an approximate strength of 127,000 active personnel in the IISS publication &quot;Military Balance 2010&quot;.

, the Indian Air Force has a sanctioned strength of 12,550 officers (12,404 serving with 146 under strength), and 142,529 airmen (127,172 serving with 15,357 under strength).

===Rank structure===
The rank structure of the Indian Air Force is based on that of the Royal Air Force. The highest rank attainable in the IAF is Marshal of the Indian Air Force, conferred by the President of India after exceptional service during wartime. MIAF Arjan Singh is the only officer to have achieved this rank. The head of the Indian Air Force is the Chief of the Air Staff, who holds the rank of Air Chief Marshal.

====Officers====
Anyone holding Indian citizenship can apply to be an officer in the Air Force as long as they satisfy the eligibility criteria. There are four entry points to become an officer. Male applicants, who are between the ages of 16 and 19 and have passed high school graduation, can apply at the &quot;Intermediate&quot; level. Men and women applicants, who have graduated from college (three-year course) and are between the ages of 18 and 28, can apply at the &quot;Graduate&quot; level entry. Graduates of engineering colleges can apply at the &quot;Engineer&quot; level if they are between the ages of 18 and 28 years. The age limit for the flying and ground duty branch is 23 years of age and for technical branch is 28 years of age. After completing a master&#x27;s degree, men and women between the ages of 18 and 28 years can apply at the &quot;Post Graduate&quot; level. Post graduate applicants do not qualify for the flying branch. For the technical branch the age limit is 28 years and for the ground duty branch it is 25. At the time of application, all applicants below 25 years of age must be single. The IAF selects candidates for officer training from these applicants. After completion of training, a candidate is commissioned as a Flying Officer.

In May 2022 Abhilasha Barak became the first ever woman combat aviator in the Indian Army


====Airmen====

The duty of an airman is to make sure that all the air and ground operations run smoothly. From operating Air Defence systems to fitting missiles, they are involved in all activities of an air base and give support to various technical and non-technical jobs. The airmen of Technical trades are responsible for maintenance, repair and prepare for use the propulsion system of aircraft and other airborne weapon delivery system, Radar, Voice/Data transmission and reception equipment, latest airborne weapon delivery systems, all types of light, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic systems of airborne missiles, aero engines, aircraft fuelling equipment and heavy duty mechanical vehicles, cranes and loading equipment etc. The competent and qualified Airmen from Technical trades also participate in flying as Flight Engineers, Flight Signallers and Flight Gunners. The recruitment of personnel below officer rank is conducted through All India Selection Tests and Recruitment Rallies. All India Selection Tests are conducted among 15 Airmen Selection Centres (ASCs) located all over India. These centres are under the direct functional control of Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), with administrative control and support by respective commands. The role of CASB is to carry out selection and enrolment of airmen from the Airmen Selection Centres for their respective commands. Candidates initially take a written test at the time of application. Those passing the written test undergo a physical fitness test, an interview conducted in English, and medical examination. Candidates for training are selected from individuals passing the battery of tests, on the basis of their performance. Upon completion of training, an individual becomes an Airman. Some MWOs and WOs are granted honorary commission in the last year of their service as an honorary Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant before retiring from the service.

===Honorary officers===
Sachin Tendulkar was the first sportsperson and the first civilian without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.

===Non combatants enrolled and civilians===
Non combatants enrolled (NCs(E)) were established in British India as personal assistants to the officer class, and are equivalent to the &quot;orderly&quot; or &quot;sahayak&quot; of the Indian Army.

Almost all the commands have some percentage of civilian strength which are central government employees. These are regular ranks which are prevalent in ministries. They are usually not posted outside their stations and are employed in administrative and non-technical work.

===Training and education===
The Indian Armed Forces have set up numerous military academies across India for training its personnel, such as the National Defence Academy (NDA). Besides the tri-service institutions, the Indian Air Force has a Training Command and several training establishments. While technical and other support staff are trained at various Ground Training Schools, the pilots are trained at the Air Force Academy, Dundigul (located in Hyderabad). The Pilot Training Establishment at Allahabad, the Air Force Administrative College at Coimbatore, the Institute of Aerospace Medicine at Bangalore, the Air Force Technical College, Bangalore at Jalahalli, the Tactics and Air Combat and Defence Establishment at Gwalior, and the Paratrooper&#x27;s Training School at Agra are some of the other training establishments of the IAF.

==Aircraft inventory==


The Indian Air Force has aircraft and equipment of Russian (erstwhile Soviet Union), British, French, Israeli, US and Indian origins with Russian aircraft dominating its inventory. HAL produces some of the Russian and British aircraft in India under licence. The exact number of aircraft in service with the Indian Air Force cannot be determined with precision from open sources. Various reliable sources provide notably divergent estimates for a variety of high-visibility aircraft. Flight International estimates there to be around 1,750 aircraft in service with the IAF, while the International Institute for Strategic Studies provides a similar estimate of 1,850 aircraft. Both sources agree there are approximately 900 combat capable (fighter, attack etc.) aircraft in the IAF.

===Multi-role fighters and strike aircraft===

The Indian Air Force, as of October 2024, has a shortage of its fighter jet squadron count. The IAF has 31 combat squadrons as against a requirement of 42. This quantity is on par with the IAF&#x27;s fighter fleet during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965. The quantity was at its peak in 1996 at 42 squadron count which later declined to 35 in 2013 due to retirement of several aircraft without replacement.

*Dassault Rafale: the latest addition to India&#x27;s aircraft arsenal; India has signed a deal for 36 Dassault Rafale multirole fighter aircraft. As of June 2022, 36 Rafale fighters are in service with the Indian Air Force.

*Sukhoi Su-30MKI: the IAF&#x27;s primary air superiority fighter, with additional air-to-ground (strike) mission capability, is the Sukhoi Su-30MKI. 260 Su-30MKIs are in service.

*Mikoyan MiG-29: the MiG-29, known as &quot;Baaz&quot; (Hindi for Hawk), is a dedicated air superiority fighter, constituting the IAF&#x27;s second line of defence after the Su-30MKI. There are 69 MiG-29s in service, all of which have been recently upgraded to the MiG-29UPG standard, after the decision was made in 2016 to upgrade the remaining 21 MiG-29s to the UPG standard.

*Dassault Mirage 2000: the Mirage 2000, known as &quot;Vajra&quot; (Sanskrit for diamond or thunderbolt) in Indian service. The IAF currently operates 49 Mirage 2000Hs and 8 Mirage 2000 TH all of which are currently being upgraded to the Mirage 2000-5 MK2 standard with Indian specific modifications and 2 Mirage 2000-5 MK2 are in service . The IAF&#x27;s Mirage 2000 were scheduled to be phased out by 2030.

*HAL Tejas: IAF MiG-21s are to be replaced by domestically built HAL Tejas. The first Tejas IAF unit, No. 45 Squadron IAF &quot;Flying Daggers&quot;, was formed on 1 July 2016, followed by No. 18 Squadron IAF &quot;Flying Bullets&quot; on 27 May 2020. Initially stationed at Bangalore, the first squadron was then to be transferred to its home base in Sulur, Tamil Nadu. In February 2021, the Indian Air Force ordered 83 Tejas, including 40 Mark 1, 73 single-seat Mark 1As and 10 two-seat Mark 1 trainers. Total 123 ordered.

*SEPECAT Jaguar: the Jaguar, known as the &quot;Shamsher&quot;, serves as the IAF&#x27;s primary ground attack force. The IAF currently operates 139 Jaguars. The first batch of DARIN-1 Jaguars are now going through a DARIN-3 upgrade being equipped with EL/M-2052 AESA radars, and an improved jamming suite plus new avionics. These aircraft are scheduled to be phased out by 2030.

* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21: the MiG-21 serves as an interceptor aircraft in the IAF, which phased out most of its MiG-21s and planned to keep only the 125 aircraft upgraded to the MiG-21 Bison standard. The phase-out date for these interceptors has been postponed several times. Initially set for 2014–2017, it was later postponed to 2019. Current phase-out was scheduled for 2021–2022.

===Airborne early warning and control system===

The IAF operates three Netra Embraer ERJ 145I aircraft. The IAF also operates the EL/W-2090 Phalcon AEW&amp;C incorporated in a Beriev A-50 platform. A total of three such systems are currently in service, with two further potential orders. India is also investing in a DRDO project to develop six new Airborne AEW&amp;C aircraft, as an upgrade to the Netra systems.

===Aerial refuelling===
The IAF currently operates six Ilyushin Il-78MKIs in the aerial refueling (tanker) role.

===Transport aircraft===
For strategic airlift operations, the IAF uses the Ilyushin Il-76, known as &quot;Gajraj&quot; (Hindi for King Elephant) in Indian service. The IAF operated 17 Il-76s in 2010, which are in the process of being replaced by C-17 Globemaster IIIs.

IAF C-130Js are used by special forces for combined Army-Air Force operations. India purchased six C-130Js; however, one crashed at Gwalior on 28 March 2014 while on a training mission, killing all 5 on board and destroying the aircraft. The Antonov An-32, known in Indian service as the &quot;Sutlej&quot; (named after Sutlej River), serves as a medium transport aircraft in the IAF. The aircraft is also used in bombing roles and paradropping operations. The IAF currently operates 105 An-32s, all of which are being upgraded. The IAF operates 53 Dornier 228 to fulfil its light transport duties. The IAF also operates Boeing 737s and Embraer ECJ-135 Legacy aircraft as VIP transports and passenger airliners for troops. 2 specially modified Boeing 777 are used for both the Indian President and Prime Minister under the call sign Air India One.

The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 once formed the backbone of the IAF&#x27;s transport fleet, but are now used mainly for training and communication duties. A replacement is under consideration.

===Trainer aircraft===
The HAL HPT-32 Deepak is IAF&#x27;s basic flight training aircraft for cadets. The HPT-32 was grounded in July 2009 following a crash that killed two senior flight instructors, but was revived in May 2010 and is to be fitted with a parachute recovery system (PRS) to enhance survivability during an emergency in the air and to bring the trainer down safely. The HPT-32 is to be phased out soon. initially by 75 trainers Pilatus aircraft, and followed by 70 HTT-40 trainers. 36 more HTT-40s to be ordered once fleet is operational. The IAF uses the HAL HJT-16 Kiran mk.I for intermediate flight training of cadets, while the HJT-16 Kiran mk.II provides advanced flight and weapons training. The HAL HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 is also operated by the Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) of the IAF. The Kiran is to be replaced by the HAL HJT-36 Sitara. The BAE Hawk Mk 132 serves as an advanced jet trainer in the IAF and is progressively replacing the Kiran Mk.II. The IAF has begun the process of converting the Surya Kiran display team to Hawks. A total of 106 BAE Hawk trainers have been ordered by the IAF of which 39 have entered service . IAF also ordered 72 Pipistrel Virus SW 80 microlight aircraft for basic training purpose.

===Helicopters===

The HAL Dhruv serves primarily as a light utility helicopter in the IAF. In addition to transport and utility roles, newer Dhruvs are also used as attack helicopters. Four Dhruvs are also operated by the Indian Air Force Sarang Helicopter Display Team. The HAL Chetak is a light utility helicopter and is used primarily for training, rescue and light transport roles in the IAF. The HAL Chetak is being gradually replaced by HAL Dhruv. The HAL Cheetah is a light utility helicopter used for high altitude operations. It is used for both transport and search-and-rescue missions in the IAF.
The Mil Mi-8 and the Mil Mi-17, Mi-17 1V and Mi-17V 5 are operated by the IAF for medium lift strategic and utility roles. The Mi-8 is being progressively replaced by the Mi-17 series of helicopters. The IAF has ordered 22 Boeing AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, 68 HAL Light Combat Helicopters (LCH), 35 HAL Rudra attack helicopters, 15 CH-47F Chinook heavy lift helicopters and 150 Mi-17V-5s to replace and augment its existing fleet of Mi-8s, Mi-17s, and Mi-24s. The Mil Mi-26 serves as a heavy lift helicopter in the IAF. It can also be used to transport troops or as a flying ambulance. The IAF currently operates three Mi-26s.

The Mil Mi-35 serves primarily as an attack helicopter in the IAF. The Mil Mi-35 can also act as a low-capacity troop transport. The IAF currently operates two squadrons (No. 104 Firebirds and No. 125 Gladiators) of Mi-25/35s.

===Unmanned aerial vehicles===
The IAF currently uses the IAI Searcher II and IAI Heron for reconnaissance and surveillance purposes. The IAI Harpy serves as an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) which is designed to attack radar systems. The IAF also operates the DRDO Lakshya which serves as realistic towed aerial sub-targets for live fire training.

==Missile systems==

=== Anti-tank guided missiles ===
===Ballistic and cruise missiles===
=== Air defence systems ===
==Future==
The number of aircraft in the IAF has been decreasing from the late 1990s due to the retirement of older aircraft and several crashes. To deal with the depletion of force levels, the IAF has started to modernize its fleet. This includes both the upgrade of existing aircraft, equipment and infrastructure as well as induction of new aircraft and equipment, both indigenous and imported. As new aircraft enter service and numbers recover, the IAF plans to have a fleet of 42 squadrons.

===Renaming===
IAF has sent a proposal to rename itself as Indian Air and Space Force (IASF). It has declared this as a part of its current drive to become a credible space power.

===Expected future acquisitions===
====Single-engined fighter====
On 3 January 2017, Minister of Defence Manohar Parrikar addressed a media conference and announced plans for a competition to select a Strategic Partner to deliver &quot;... 200 new single engine fighters to be made in India, which will easily cost around (USD)$45 million apiece without weaponry&quot; with an expectation that Lockheed Martin (USA) and Saab (Sweden) will pitch the F-16 Block 70 and Gripen, respectively. An MoD official said that a global tender will be put to market in the first quarter of 2018, with a private company nominated as the strategic partners production agency followed by a two or more year process to evaluate technical and financial bids and conduct trials, before the final government-to-government deal in 2021. This represents 11 squadrons of aircraft plus several &#x27;attrition&#x27; aircraft. India is also planning to set up an assembly line of American Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 in Bengaluru. It is not yet confirmed whether IAF will induct these aircraft or not.

In 2018, the defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave the go ahead to scale up the manufacturing of Tejas at HAL and also to export Tejas. She is quoted saying &quot;We are not ditching the LCA. We have not gone for anything instead of Tejas. We are very confident that Tejas Mark II will be a big leap forward to fulfil the single engine fighter requirement of the forces.&quot;. IAF committed to buy 201 Mark-II variant of the Tejas taking the total order of Tejas to 324. The government also scrapped the plan to import single engine fighters leading to reduction in reliance on imports thereby strengthening the domestic defence industry.

The IAF also submitted a request for information to international suppliers for a stealth unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV).

===Current acquisitions===

IAF&#x27;s current orders include

* HAL Tejas - 73 Mk 1A on order, 17 trainers on order. 97 more cleared for order.
* HAL HTT-40: 70 on order
* HAL Prachand: 66 cleared
* HAL Light Utility Helicopter (LUH): 6 on order
* EADS CASA C-295: 55 on order
* IAI Harop UCAVs 
* General Atomic MQ-9B Predator: 8 planned

===DRDO and HAL projects===

Indian defence company HAL and Defense Research Organization DRDO are developing several aircraft for the IAF including:-

* HAL Tejas Mk 2
* HAL AMCA (5th generation aircraft)
* NAL Saras 
* HAL HJT-36 Yashas
* DRDO Rustom
* TAPAS-BH-201
* DRDO Ghatak UCAV. 
* HAL CATS: DRDO and HAL has also engaged in the unmanned combat system. According to this, HAL will develop the whole family of unmanned aircraft by the end of 2024–25 
* Akash-NG is also being developed by DRDO which will be the same range of Barak 8. 
* DRDO has now successfully developed the nuclear capable Nirbhay cruise missile.

===Network-centric warfare===
The Air Force Network (AFNET), a robust digital information grid that enabled quick and accurate threat responses, was launched in 2010, helping the IAF become a truly network-centric air force. AFNET is a secure communication network linking command and control centres with offensive aircraft, sensor platforms and ground missile batteries. Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated system for Air Defence operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating ground and airborne sensors, weapon systems and command and control nodes. Subsequent integration with civil radar and other networks shall provide an integrated Air Situation Picture, and reportedly acts as a force multiplier for intelligence analysis, mission control, and support activities like maintenance and logistics. The design features multiple layers of security measures, including encryption and intrusion prevention technologies, to hinder and deter espionage efforts.

== Media ==
In the year 2005, the National Geographic Channel created a 10 part documentary series detailing out all the branches of the Indian Air Force. It was titled &quot;Mission Udaan - Inside the Indian Air Force&quot;.

In partnership with &quot;Threye&quot;, a Delhi based game developer, The IAF launched Guardians of the Skies, a roleplaying combat game for mobile devices in 2014. The IAF would later also create a successor, titled Indian Air Force: A Cut Above, in 2019.

<text>A path (or filepath, file path, pathname, or similar) is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a location in a directory structure. It is composed by following the directory tree hierarchy in which components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash (&quot;/&quot;), the backslash character (&quot;\&quot;), or colon (&quot;:&quot;), though some operating systems may use a different delimiter. Paths are used extensively in computer science to represent the directory/file relationships common in modern operating systems and are essential in the construction of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Resources can be represented by either &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; paths.

==History==
Multics first introduced a hierarchical file system with directories (separated by &quot;&gt;&quot;) in the mid-1960s.

Around 1970, Unix introduced the slash character (&quot;/&quot;) as its directory separator.

In 1981, the first version of Microsoft DOS was released. MS-DOS 1.0 did not support file directories. Also, a major portion of the utility commands packaged with MS-DOS 1.0 came from IBM and their command line syntax used the slash character as a &#x27;switch&#x27; prefix. For example, codice_1 runs the codice_2 command with the wide list format option.

This use of slash can still be found in the command interface under Microsoft Windows. By contrast, Unix uses the hyphen-minus character (&quot;-&quot;) as a command-line switch prefix.

When directory support was added to MS-DOS in version 2.0, &quot;/&quot; was kept as the switch prefix character for backward compatibility. Microsoft chose the backslash character (&quot;\&quot;) as a directory separator, which looks similar to the slash character, though more modern version of Windows are slash-agnostic, allowing mixing of both types of slash in a path.

==Absolute and relative paths==
An absolute or full path points to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory. To do that, it must include the root directory.

By contrast, a relative path starts from some given working directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path. A filename can be considered as a relative path based at the current working directory. If the working directory is not the file&#x27;s parent directory, a file not found error will result if the file is addressed by its name.

==Base URL==
A base URL is the consistent part of an API path, to which endpoint paths are appended.

==Representations of paths by operating system and shell==
Japanese and Korean versions of Windows may often display the &#x27;¥&#x27; character or the &#x27;₩&#x27; character instead of the directory separator. In such cases the code for a backslash is being drawn as these characters. Very early versions of MS-DOS replaced the backslash with these glyphs on the display to make it possible to display them by programs that only understood 7-bit ASCII (other characters such as the square brackets were replaced as well, see ISO 646, Windows Codepage 932 (Japanese Shift JIS), and Codepage 949 (Korean)). Although even the first version of Windows supported the 8-bit ISO-8859-1 character set which has the Yen sign at U+00A5, and modern versions of Windows supports Unicode which has the Won sign at U+20A9, much software will continue to display backslashes found in ASCII files this way to preserve backward compatibility.

Mac OS X, as a derivative of UNIX, uses UNIX paths internally. However, to preserve compatibility for software and familiarity for users, many portions of the GUI switch &quot;/&quot; typed by the user to &quot;:&quot; internally, and switch them back when displaying filenames (a &quot;:&quot; entered by the user is also changed into &quot;/&quot; but the inverse translation does not happen).

==Paths in programming languages==
Programming languages also use paths. E.g.: When a file is opened. Most programming languages use the path representation of the underlying operating system:

 codice_3

 codice_4

This direct access to the operating system paths can hinder the portability of programs. To support portable programs Java uses &quot;File.separator&quot; to distinguish between / and \ separated paths. Seed7 has a different approach for the path representation. In Seed7 all paths use the Unix path convention, independent of the operating system. Under windows a mapping takes place (e.g.: The path &quot;/c/users&quot; is mapped to &quot;c:\users&quot;).

==Universal Naming Convention==

The Microsoft Windows UNC, short for Universal Naming Convention or Uniform Naming Convention, specifies a common syntax to describe the location of a network resource, such as a shared file, directory, or printer. The UNC syntax for Windows systems has the generic form:

 \\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource

Microsoft often refers to this as a &quot;network path&quot;.

Some Microsoft Windows interfaces also allow or require UNC syntax for WebDAV share access, rather than a URL. The UNC syntax is extended with optional components to denote use of SSL and TCP/IP port number, a WebDAV URL of codice_5 becomes

 \\HostName[@SSL][@Port]\SharedFolder\Resource

When viewed remotely, the &quot;SharedFolder&quot; may have a name different from what a program on the server sees when opening &quot;\SharedFolder&quot;. Instead, the SharedFolder name consists of an arbitrary name assigned to the folder when defining its &quot;sharing&quot;.

Some Microsoft Windows interfaces also accept the &quot;Long UNC&quot;:

 \\?\UNC\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource

Microsoft Windows uses the following types of paths:

* local file system (LFS), such as codice_6
* universal naming convention (UNC), such as codice_7 or /codice_8 (at least in Windows 7 and later)
* &quot;long&quot; device path such as codice_9 or codice_10. This path points to the local file namespace and is a similar one that points to the local DOS device namespace. This format is also the &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;uninterpreted&quot; path, since it sends paths straight to the file system without converting to and interpreting names like .
* Windows NT object manager codice_11-prefixed paths (global DOS namespace).

In versions of Windows prior to Windows XP, only the APIs that accept &quot;long&quot; device paths could accept more than 260 characters.

The shell in Windows XP and Windows Vista, explorer.exe, allows path names up to 248 characters long.

Since UNCs start with two backslashes, and the backslash is also used for string escaping and in regular expressions, this can result in extreme cases of leaning toothpick syndrome: an escaped string for a regular expression matching a UNC begins with 8 backslashes – codice_12 – because the string and regular expression both require escaping. This can be simplified by using raw strings, as in C#&#x27;s codice_13 or Python&#x27;s codice_14, or regular expression literals, as in Perl&#x27;s codice_15.

==POSIX pathname definition==
Most Unix-like systems use a similar syntax.
POSIX allows treating a path beginning with two slashes in an implementation-defined manner,
though in other cases systems must treat multiple slashes as single slashes.
Many applications on Unix-like systems (for example, scp, rcp, and rsync) use resource definitions such as:

 hostname:/directorypath/resource

or URI schemes with the service name (here &#x27;smb&#x27;):

 smb://hostname/directorypath/resource

==Example==

===Unix style===
The following worked example discusses the behavior of a Unix-style file system as it would appear from a terminal or terminal application (command-line window):

Attached to a current working directory (cwd) of:
 /users/mark/

One wants to change the current working directory to:
 /users/mark/bobapples

At that moment, the relative path for the desired directory can be represented as:
 ./bobapples

or for short:
 bobapples

and the absolute path for the directory as:
 /users/mark/bobapples

Given &quot;bobapples&quot; as the relative path for the directory wanted, the following may be typed at the command prompt to change the current working directory to bobapples:
 cd bobapples

Two dots (&quot;) point upward in the hierarchy, to indicate the parent directory; one dot (&quot;) represents the current directory itself. Both can be components of a complex relative path (e.g., &quot;), where &quot; alone or as the first component of such a relative path represents the working directory. (Using &quot; to refer to a file &quot; in the current working directory can sometimes usefully distinguish it from a resource &quot;&quot; to be found in a default directory or by other means; for example, to view a specific version of a manual page instead of the one installed in the system.)

===MS-DOS/Microsoft Windows style===
Contrary to popular belief, the Windows system API accepts slash, and thus all the above Unix examples should work. But many applications on Windows interpret a slash for other purposes or treat it as an invalid character, and thus require you to enter backslash – notably the cmd.exe shell (often called the &quot;terminal&quot; as it typically runs in a terminal window). Note that many other shells available for Windows, such as tcsh and Windows PowerShell, allow the slash.

In addition &quot;\&quot; does not indicate a single root, but instead the root of the &quot;current disk&quot;. Indicating a file on a disk other than the current one requires prefixing a drive letter and colon. No ambiguity ensues, because colon is not a valid character in an MS-DOS filename, and thus one cannot have a file called &quot;A:&quot; in the current directory.

UNC names (any path starting with ) do not support slashes.

The following examples show MS-DOS/Windows-style paths, with backslashes used to match the most common syntax:

 A:\Temp\File.txt

This path points to a file with the name , located in the directory , which in turn is located in the root directory of the drive .

 C:..\File.txt

This path refers to a file called located in the parent directory of the current directory on drive .

 Folder\SubFolder\File.txt

This path denotes a file called located in directory which in turn is located in directory which is located in the current directory of the current drive (since this example gives no drive-specification).

 File.txt

This rather simple path points to a file named codice_16 located in the current directory (since the path lacks a directory-specification) on the current drive (since no drive specification is present).

 \\.\COM1

This path refers to the first serial port (COM1).
C:\&gt;more &lt; C:/Windows/system.ini
; for 16-bit app support
[386Enh]
woafont=dosapp.fon
EGA80WOA.FON=EGA80WOA.FON
EGA40WOA.FON=EGA40WOA.FON
CGA80WOA.FON=CGA80WOA.FON
CGA40WOA.FON=CGA40WOA.FON

This example uses a path containing slashes as directory separator. The command redirects the content of the file to the codice_17 command.

E:\&gt;dir &quot;/Folder/SubFolder/&quot; /Q
 Volume in drive E is Data
 Volume Serial Number is 07BE-0B10

 Directory of E:\Folder\SubFolder

18 October 2008 08:15 AM &lt;DIR&gt; DOMAIN\user .
18 October 2008 08:15 AM &lt;DIR&gt; DOMAIN\user ..
18 October 2008 08:15 AM &lt;DIR&gt; DOMAIN\user File.txt
 1 File(s) 8 bytes
 2 Dir(s) 19,063,000 bytes free

A path containing forward slashes often needs to be surrounded by double quotes to disambiguate it from command-line switches.

*note: CD does not work this way:

CD &quot;[drive letter]:/Program Files&quot; will only work from the root ([drive letter]:\) directory. This appears to treat all forward slashes the same as .\. 

*exception: Use the /D switch to change current drive in addition to changing current directory for a drive.

For example:

 CD &quot;C:.\Program Files&quot;
works the same as
 CD &quot;C:/Program Files&quot;

Also, from a root folder:

 CD &quot;C:.\Program Files.\Internet Explorer&quot;
would be treated the same as
 CD &quot;C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer&quot;

If there is no relative path to the directory name specified with forward slashes you will get the following error:

 The system cannot find the path specified.

For setting environment variables, it is sometimes necessary to provide a path that does not contain spaces in it, for instance defined as &quot;C:\Program Files\Java...&quot; can cause scripts to halt when they encounter the space in the path name. To get the eight-character name Windows assigns to any directory for substitution in environment variables, use the directory listing command with the /x option one level up from the target directory. For instance, the following will display the 8.3 filenames for all directories directly under root:
C:\&gt;dir /x
(Users can disable 8.3 filename creation on a drive-by-drive basis.)

<doc id="403359" wikidata="Q1073400" url="?curid=403359" title="Kyōbashi Station (Osaka)">
<text>is a railway station in the Kyōbashi district of Jōtō-ku and Miyakojima-ku, Osaka, Japan, jointly operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West), the private railway operator Keihan Railway, and the Osaka Metro.

==Lines==
;JR West:

The Tōzai and Gakkentoshi Lines form a combined service line in practice.

;Keihan Railway (KH04):
* Keihan Main Line

;Osaka Metro:
* (N22)

==JR West==


, Kyobashi was the fourth-busiest station in the JR West network after Osaka Station, Kyoto Station and Tennoji Station.

===Layout===
====Gakkentoshi Line (Katamachi Line) and JR Tōzai Line====
There are an island platform and a side platform with two tracks at ground level.


====Osaka Loop Line====
There are two side platforms with two elevated tracks.


===Adjacent stations===




===History===
The station opened on 17 October 1895.

During the bombing of Osaka on August 14, 1945, a one-ton bomb directly struck the Katamachi Line platform and killed 700 to 800 evacuees. Kyobashi was one of the last sites to be bombed in Japan during World War II, followed only by the bombing of Akita, later the same day. A memorial was erected on the site in 1947, and anniversary services have been held at the station every year since 1955.

With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR) on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR West.

The JR Tozai Line opened in 1997, at which point Kyobashi became a terminal for both the Tozai Line and Katamachi Line.

Station numbering was introduced on the JR West lines in March 2018 with the Osaka Loop Line being assigned station number JR-O08 and the Tozai Line being assigned station number JR-H41.

==Keihan Railway==

<text>Colliston Castle is a 16th-century Z-plan tower house, altered and extended in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is located north of Arbroath, in Angus, Scotland, and remains occupied.

==History==
Colliston was part of the lands of Arbroath Abbey from its foundation in the 12th century. On 25 July 1544, David Beaton, Abbot of Arbroath and Archbishop of St Andrews, granted the lands of Colliston, Knives, Park of Conon, and Guthrie Hill, to John Guthrie and his wife Isobel Ogilvie. Colliston was retained by the Guthries until the late 17th century, when it passed to the Gordon family. By 1820 George Chaplin was in possession of Colliston, and was succeeded by his nephew George Robertson Chaplin of Auchengray, and then George Chaplin Child Chaplin, M.D. He died in 1883, and was succeeded by Mr Peebles of Somerset House, London. It was purchased in 1920 by Major R.F.D. Bruce, whose wife continued to live there after his death. It was sold several times during the 20th century, and most recently in 2011. The house is currently available for holiday rentals. It is a category B listed building.

==Description==
The original Z-plan part of the castle of Colliston bears the date 1583 (sometimes misread as 1553). It consists of a main block with two round towers projecting at opposite corners, and a stair turret rising in one of the re-entrant angles between the main block and tower. This tower, which also houses the entrance to the castle, is corbelled out at the top to form a gabled watch-chamber. The plan is similar to Claypotts Castle and is amply provided with wide splayed gun-loops and circular shot-holes for defence. The wall heads and the entire upper storey were remodelled several times and are not original. A later doorway is dated 1621, and the north and east wings were added in the 18th and 19th centuries.

<doc id="403362" wikidata="Q295089" url="?curid=403362" title="Radeon">
<text>Radeon () is a brand of computer products, including graphics processing units, random-access memory, RAM disk software, and solid-state drives, produced by Radeon Technologies Group, a division of AMD. The brand was launched in 2000 by ATI Technologies, which was acquired by AMD in 2006 for US$5.4 billion.

== Radeon Graphics ==
Radeon Graphics is the successor to the Rage line. Four different families of microarchitectures can be roughly distinguished, the fixed-pipeline family, the unified shader model-families of TeraScale, Graphics Core Next, and RDNA. ATI/AMD have developed different technologies, such as TruForm, HyperMemory, HyperZ, XGP, Eyefinity for multi-monitor setups, PowerPlay for power-saving, CrossFire (for multi-GPU) or Hybrid Graphics. A range of SIP blocks is also to be found on certain models in the Radeon products line: Unified Video Decoder, Video Coding Engine and TrueAudio.

The brand was previously only known as &quot;ATI Radeon&quot; until August 2010, when it was renamed to increase AMD&#x27;s brand awareness on a global scale. Products up to and including the HD 5000 series are branded as ATI Radeon, while the HD 6000 series and beyond use the new AMD Radeon branding.

On 11 September 2015, AMD&#x27;s GPU business was split into a separate unit known as Radeon Technologies Group, with Raja Koduri as Senior Vice President and chief architect.

=== Radeon graphics card brands ===
AMD does not distribute Radeon cards directly to consumers (though some exceptions can be found). Instead, it sells Radeon GPUs to third-party manufacturers, who build and sell the Radeon-based video cards to the OEM and retail channels. Manufacturers of the Radeon cards—some of whom also make motherboards—include ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Club 3D, Diamond, Force3D, Gainward, Gigabyte, HIS, MSI, PowerColor, Sapphire, VisionTek, and XFX.

== Graphics processor generations ==
Early generations were identified with a number and major/minor alphabetic prefix. Later generations were assigned code names. New or heavily redesigned architectures have a prefix of &quot;R&quot; (e.g., &quot;R300&quot; or &quot;R600&quot;) while slight modifications are indicated by the &quot;RV&quot; prefix (e.g., &quot;RV370&quot; or &quot;RV635&quot;).

The first derivative architecture, &quot;RV200&quot;, did not follow the scheme used by later parts.

=== Fixed-pipeline family ===

==== R100/RV200 ====
The Radeon, first introduced in 2000, was ATI&#x27;s first graphics processor to be fully DirectX 7 compliant. R100 brought with it large gains in bandwidth and fill-rate efficiency through the new HyperZ technology.

The RV200 was a die-shrink of the former R100 with some core logic tweaks for clockspeed, introduced in 2002. The only release in this generation was the Radeon 7500, which introduced little in the way of new features but offered substantial performance improvements over its predecessors.

==== R200 ====
ATI&#x27;s second generation Radeon included a sophisticated pixel shader architecture. This chipset implemented Microsoft&#x27;s pixel shader 1.4 specification for the first time.

It&#x27;s performance relative to competitors was widely perceived as weak, and subsequent revisions of this generation were cancelled to focus on development of the next generation.

====R300/R350====

The R300 was the first GPU to fully support Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX 9.0 technology upon its release in 2001. It incorporated fully programmable pixel and vertex shaders.

About a year later, the architecture was revised to allow for higher frequencies, more efficient memory access, and several other improvements in the R350 family. A budget line of RV350 products was based on this refreshed design with some elements disabled or removed.

Models using the new PCI Express interface were introduced in 2004. Using 110-nm and 130-nm manufacturing technologies under the X300 and X600 names, respectively, the RV370 and RV380 graphics processors were used extensively by consumer PC manufacturers.

====R420====
While heavily based upon the previous generation, this line included extensions to the Shader Model 2 feature-set. Shader Model 2b, the specification ATI and Microsoft defined with this generation, offered somewhat more shader program flexibility.

====R520====
ATI&#x27;s DirectX 9.0c series of graphics cards, with complete shader Model 3.0 support. Launched in October 2005, this series brought a number of enhancements including the floating point render target technology necessary for HDR rendering with anti-aliasing.

=== TeraScale-family ===
==== R600 ====

ATI&#x27;s first series of GPUs to replace the old fixed-pipeline and implement unified shader model. Subsequent revisions tuned the design for higher performance and energy efficiency, resulting in the ATI Mobility Radeon HD series for mobile computers.

==== R700 ====

Based on the R600 architecture. Mostly a bolstered with many more stream processors, with improvements to power consumption and GDDR5 support for the high-end RV770 and RV740(HD4770) chips. It arrived in late June 2008. The HD 4850 and HD 4870 have 800 stream processors and GDDR3 and GDDR5 memory, respectively. The 4890 was a refresh of 4870 with the same amount of stream processors yet higher clock rates due to refinements. The 4870x2 has 1600 stream processors and GDDR5 memory on an effective 512-bit memory bus with 230.4 Gbit/s video memory bandwidth available.

==== Evergreen ====

The series was launched on 23 September 2009. It featured a 40 nm fabrication process for the entire product line (only the HD4770 (RV740) was built on this process previously), with more stream cores and compatibility with the next major version of the DirectX API, DirectX 11, which launched on 22 October 2009 along with Microsoft Windows 7. The Rxxx/RVxxx codename scheme was scrapped entirely. The initial launch consisted of only the 5870 and 5850 models. ATI released beta drivers that introduced full OpenGL 4.0 support on all variants of this series in March 2010.

==== Northern Islands ====
This is the first series to be marketed solely under the &quot;AMD&quot; brand. It features a 3rd generation 40 nm design, rebalancing the existing architecture with redesigned shaders to give it better performance. It was released first on 22 October 2010, in the form of the 6850 and 6870. 3D output is enabled with HDMI 1.4a and DisplayPort 1.2 outputs.

=== Graphics Core Next-family ===

==== Southern Islands ====

&quot;Southern Islands&quot; was the first series to feature the new compute microarchitecture known as &quot;Graphics Core Next&quot;(GCN). GCN was used among the higher end cards, while the VLIW5 architecture utilized in the previous generation was used in the lower end, OEM products. However, the &quot;Radeon HD 7790&quot; uses GCN 2, and was the first product in the series to be released by AMD on 9 January 2012.

==== Sea Islands ====

The &quot;Sea Islands&quot; were OEM rebadges of the 7000 series, with only three products, code named Oland, available for general retail. The series, just like the &quot;Southern Islands&quot;, used a mixture of VLIW5 models and GCN models for its desktop products.

==== Volcanic Islands ====

&quot;Volcanic Islands&quot; GPUs were introduced with the AMD Radeon RX 200 series, and were first released in late 2013. The Radeon RX 200 line is mainly based on AMD&#x27;s GCN architecture, with the lower end, OEM cards still using VLIW5. The majority of desktop products use GCN 1, while the &quot;R9 290x/290&quot; &amp; &quot;R7 260X/260&quot; use GCN 2, and with only the R9 285 using the new GCN 3.

==== Caribbean Islands ====

GPUs codenamed &quot;Caribbean Islands&quot; were introduced with the AMD Radeon RX 300 series, released in 2015. This series was the first to solely use GCN based models, ranging from GCN 1st to GCN 3rd Gen, including the GCN 3-based Fiji-architecture models named Fury X, Fury, Nano and the Radeon Pro Duo.

==== Arctic Islands ====

GPUs codenamed &quot;Arctic Islands&quot; were first introduced with the Radeon RX 400 series in June 2016 with the announcement of the &quot;RX 480&quot;. These cards were the first to use the new Polaris chips which implements GCN 4th Gen on the 14 nm fab process. The RX 500 series released in April 2017 also uses Polaris chips.

==== Vega ====
=== RDNA-family ===
==== RDNA 1 ====

On 27 May 2019, at COMPUTEX 2019, AMD announced the new &#x27;RDNA&#x27; graphics micro-architecture, which is to succeed the Graphics Core Next micro-architecture. This is the basis for the Radeon RX 5700-series graphics cards, the first to be built under the codename &#x27;Navi&#x27;. These cards feature GDDR6 SGRAM and support for PCI Express 4.0.

==== RDNA 2 ====

On 5 March 2020, AMD publicly announced its plan to release a &quot;refresh&quot; of the RDNA micro-architecture. Dubbed as the RDNA 2 architecture, it was stated to succeed the first-gen RDNA micro-architecture and was initially scheduled for a release in Q4 2020. RDNA 2 was confirmed as the graphics microarchitecture featured in the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles from Microsoft, and PlayStation 5 from Sony, with proprietary tweaks and different GPU configurations in each systems&#x27; implementation.

AMD unveiled the Radeon RX 6000 series, its next-gen RDNA 2 graphics cards at an online event on 28 October 2020. The lineup consists of the RX 6800, RX 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT. The RX 6800 and 6800 XT launched on 18 November 2020, with the RX 6900 XT being released on 8 December 2020. Further variants including a Radeon RX 6700 (XT) series based on Navi 22, launched on 18 March 2021, a Radeon RX 6600(XT) series based on Navi 23, launched on 11 August 2021 (that is the 6600XT release date, the RX 6600 launched on 13 October 2021), and a Radeon RX 6500(XT), launched on 19 January 2022.

===API overview===

Some generations vary from their predecessors predominantly due to architectural improvements, while others were adapted primarily to new manufacturing processes with fewer functional changes. The table below summarizes the APIs supported in each Radeon generation (including pre-Radeon ATI GPUs). Also see AMD FireStream and AMD FirePro branded products.
=== Feature overview ===
== Graphics device drivers ==
=== AMD&#x27;s proprietary graphics &quot;Radeon Software&quot; (Formerly Catalyst) ===
On 24 November 2015, AMD released a new version of their graphics driver following the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group (RTG) to provide extensive software support for their graphics cards. This driver, labelled Radeon Software Crimson Edition, overhauls the UI with Qt, resulting in better responsiveness from a design and system perspective. It includes a new interface featuring a game manager, clocking tools, and sections for different technologies.

Unofficial modifications such as Omega drivers and DNA drivers were available. These drivers typically consist of mixtures of various driver file versions with some registry variables altered and are advertised as offering superior performance or image quality. They are, of course, unsupported, and as such, are not guaranteed to function correctly. Some of them also provide modified system files for hardware enthusiasts to run specific graphics cards outside of their specifications.

==== On operating systems ====
Radeon Software is being developed for Microsoft Windows and Linux. , other operating systems are not officially supported. This may be different for the Radeon Pro brand, which is based on identical hardware but features OpenGL-certified graphics device drivers.

ATI previously offered driver updates for their retail and integrated Macintosh video cards and chipsets. ATI stopped support for Mac OS 9 after the Radeon R200 cards, making the last officially supported card the Radeon 9250. The Radeon R100 cards up to the Radeon 7200 can still be used with even older classic Mac OS versions such as System 7, although not all features are taken advantage of by the older operating system.

Ever since ATI&#x27;s acquisition by AMD, ATI no longer supplies or supports drivers for classic Mac OS nor macOS. macOS drivers can be downloaded from Apple&#x27;s support website, while classic Mac OS drivers can be obtained from 3rd party websites that host the older drivers for users to download. ATI used to provide a preference panel for use in macOS called ATI Displays which can be used both with retail and OEM versions of its cards. Though it gives more control over advanced features of the graphics chipset, ATI Displays has limited functionality compared to Catalyst for Windows or Linux.

=== Third-party free and open-source &quot;Radeon&quot; ===
The free and open-source for Direct Rendering Infrastructure has been under constant development by the Linux kernel developers, by 3rd party programming enthusiasts and by AMD employees. It is composed out of five parts:

# Linux kernel component DRM
#* this part received dynamic re-clocking support in Linux kernel version 3.12 and its performance has become comparable to that of AMD Catalyst
# Linux kernel component KMS driver: basically the device driver for the display controller
# user-space component libDRM
# user-space component in Mesa 3D; currently most of these components are written conforming to the Gallium3D-specifications.
#* all drivers in Mesa 3D with Version 10.x (last 10.6.7) are as of September 2014 limited to OpenGL version 3.3 and OpenGL ES 3.0.
#* all drivers in Mesa 3D with Version 11.x (last 11.2.2) are as of Mai 2016 limited to OpenGL version 4.1 and OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1 (11.2+).
#* all drivers in Mesa 3D with version 12.x (in June 2016) can support OpenGL version 4.3.
#* all drivers in Mesa 3D with Version 13.0.x ( in November 2016) can support OpenGL 4.4 and unofficial 4.5.
#* all drivers in Mesa 3D with Version 17.0.x ( in January 2017) can support OpenGL 4.5 and OpenGL ES 3.2
#* Actual Hardware Support for different MESA versions see: glxinfo 
#* AMD R600/700 since Mesa 10.1: OpenGL 3.3+, OpenGL ES 3.0+ (+: some more Features of higher Levels and Mesa Version)
#* AMD R800/900 (Evergreen, Northern Islands): OpenGL 4.1+ (Mesa 13.0+), OpenGL ES 3.0+ (Mesa 10.3+)
#* AMD GCN (Southern/Sea Islands and newer): OpenGL 4.5+ (Mesa 17.0+), OpenGL ES 3.2+ (Mesa 18.0+), Vulkan 1.0 (Mesa 17.0+), Vulkan 1.1 (GCN 2nd Gen+, Mesa 18.1+)
# a special and distinct 2D graphics device driver for X.Org Server, which is finally about to be replaced by Glamor
# OpenCL with GalliumCompute (previous Clover) is not full developed in 1.0, 1.1 and only parts of 1.2. Some OpenCL conformance tests were failed in 1.0 and 1.1, most in 1.2. ROCm is developed by AMD and Open Source. OpenCL 1.2 is full supported with OpenCL 2.0 language. Only CPU or GCN-Hardware with PCIe 3.0 is supported. So GCN 3rd Gen. or higher is here full usable for OpenCL 1.2 software.

==== Supported features ====
The free and open-source driver supports many of the features available in Radeon-branded cards and APUs, such as multi-monitor or hybrid graphics.

==== Linux ====
The free and open-source drivers are primarily developed on Linux and for Linux.

==== Other operating systems ====
Being entirely free and open-source software, the free and open-source drivers can be ported to any existing operating system. Whether they have been, and to what extent depends entirely on the man-power available. Available support shall be referenced here.

FreeBSD adopted DRI, and since Mesa 3D is not programmed for Linux, it should have identical support.

MorphOS supports 2D and 3D acceleration for Radeon R100, R200 and R300 chipsets.

AmigaOS 4 supports Radeon R100, R200, R300, R520 (X1000 series), R700 (HD 4000 series), HD 5000 (Evergreen) series, HD 6000 (Northern Islands) series and HD 7000 (Southern Islands) series. The RadeonHD AmigaOS 4 driver has been developed by Hans de Ruiter funded and owned by A-EON Technology Ltd. The older R100 and R200 &quot;ATIRadeon&quot; driver for AmigaOS, originally developed Forefront Technologies has been acquired by A-EON Technology Ltd in 2015.

In the past ATI provided hardware and technical documentation to the Haiku Project to produce drivers with full 2D and video in/out support on older Radeon chipsets (up to R500) for Haiku. A new Radeon HD driver was developed with the unofficial and indirect guidance of AMD open source engineers and currently exists in recent Haiku versions. The new Radeon HD driver supports native mode setting on R600 through Southern Islands GPU&#x27;s.

==== Driver vulnerabilities ====

Current drivers are affected by LeftoverLocals vulnerability referenced as GPU Memory Leaks by AMD. This was supposed to be fixed at 2024 Q1 but it has been postponed several times and the current plan for desktop CPUs containing Radeon GPU and GPUs mitigation is set for 2025 Q2 leaving customers exposed to it for more than year. Other vendors facing this vulnerability such as Qualcom fixed this issue within a month.

==Embedded GPU products==
AMD (and its predecessor ATI) have released a series of embedded GPUs targeted toward medical, entertainment, and display devices.

==Radeon Memory==
In August 2011, AMD expanded the Radeon name to include random access memory modules under the AMD Memory line. The initial releases included 3 types of 2GiB DDR3 SDRAM modules: Entertainment (1333 MHz, CL9 9-9), UltraPro Gaming (1600 MHz, CL11 11-11) and Enterprise (specs to be determined).

On May 8, 2013, AMD announced the release of Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory.

Radeon R9 2400 Gamer Series Memory was released on January 16, 2014.

===Production===
Dataram Corporation is manufacturing RAM for AMD.

==Radeon RAMDisk==
On September 6, 2012, Dataram Corporation announced it has entered into a formal agreement with AMD to develop an AMD-branded version of Dataram&#x27;s RAMDisk software under the name Radeon RAMDisk, targeting gaming enthusiasts seeking exponential improvements in game load times leading to an enhanced gaming experience. The freeware version of Radeon RAMDisk software supports Windows Vista and later with minimum 4GiB memory, and supports maximum of 4GiB RAM disk (6GiB if AMD Radeon Value, Entertainment, Performance Edition or Products installed, and Radeon RAMDisk is activated between 2012-10-10 and 2013-10-10). Retail version supports RAM disk size between 5MiB to 64GiB.

===Version history===
Version 4.1 was released in May 8, 2013.

===Production===
In 2014-04-02, Dataram Corporation announced it has signed an Agreement with Elysium Europe Ltd. to expand sales penetration in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Under this Agreement, Elysium is authorized to sell AMD Radeon RAMDisk software. Elysium is focusing on etailers, retailers, system builders and distributors.

==Radeon SSD==
AMD planned to enter solid state drive market with the introduction of R7 models powered by Indilinx Barefoot 3 controller and Toshiba 19 nm MLC flash memory, and initially available in 120G, 240G, 480G capacities. The R7 Series SSD was released on August 9, 2014, which included Toshiba&#x27;s A19 MLC NAND flash memory, Indilinx Barefoot 3 M00 controller. These components are the same as in the SSD OCZ Vector 150 model.

The Workers&#x27; Party, which uses the abbreviation &quot;PT&quot;, advocates for the protection and promotion of trade union movements in Algeria, from its claims, including a figure egalitarian doctrine is to claim that a better distribution of wealth on the people of country. The creation of this party back to the year 1990, one year after the constitutional reform which introduced a multiparty system. Its Secretary General is Louisa Hanoune, who in 2004 was the first woman in the Arab world to stand as a candidate for a presidential election.

==History==
The Workers&#x27; Party was founded in 1990 by workers, trade unionists, peasants and youth at the initiative of the Socialist Workers Organization, on a platform of class struggle deriving from what it sees as the major contradiction between the interests of workers and &quot;exploited classes&quot;, and &quot;oppressed&quot; and those of owners, &quot;exploiters&quot; and &quot;oppressors&quot;. Louisa Hanoune has been its president since its inception.

The PT aims to provide workers with independent political representation.

The Workers&#x27; Party claims continuity with the Algerian national movement, in particular the North African Star and the Algerian People&#x27;s Party. It is at odds with what it sees as &quot;imperialism&quot; embodied in the activities of the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the European Union, the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development (NEPAD), etc. Part of the labor movement internationally, the Workers&#x27; Party wishes to achieve socialism.

The party is a member of the International Liaison Committee for a Workers&#x27; International.

==The PT==
The PT campaigns for the cancellation of external debt, the defense of nationalization of land, natural soil and subsoil, businesses and infrastructure (railways, water, electricity, ports, airports, cultural and artistic heritage, telecommunications, air and sea).

It favors the preservation of public enterprises against privatization and for the re-nationalization of public services and enterprises which have been privatized. It campaigns for the right to free and compulsory public education until the age of 16, and against private education. It campaigns for the prohibition of child labour, the right to public health care, for the right to housing.

It campaigns for a national development plan based around public works, funded by public investment and agrarian reform. The party opposes localism.
==Ideology and Issues==
The PT is a socialist party in the Trotskyist tradition. The party supports cancellation of international debts, favors compulsory education until the age of 16, and the nationalization of natural resources.

The Workers&#x27; Party calls for the election of a Constituent Assembly by direct universal suffrage and secret ballot.

In the immediate future the Workers&#x27; Party considers major issues to be:
*The release of all political prisoners.
*The resolution of the issue of missing persons.
*The right to organize
*The restoration of all democratic freedoms, including lifting the state of emergency and all emergency measures, the restoration of freedom of the press, and allowing for trade union activity.
*Respect for the multiparty system.
*The equal rights between women and men, which would entail the repeal of the Family Code and the enactment of civil laws giving full citizenship to women,
*The recognition of Tamazight as an official language, and that it be taught in schools and used in public institutions.
*The right to a permanent work for all those who live.
*A sliding scale of wages and pensions, indexed for the cost of living.
*The preservation of the social security system and retirement pay.
*The right to collective bargaining.
*The preservation of current positions within the public sector
*Prohibition of any wages below the minimum wage.
*The ratification of all ILO Conventions

<doc id="403365" wikidata="Q191494" url="?curid=403365" title="Digraph (orthography)">
<text>A digraph () or digram is a pair of characters used in the orthography of a language to write either a single phoneme (distinct sound), or a sequence of phonemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined.

Some digraphs represent phonemes that cannot be represented with a single character in the writing system of a language, like in Spanish &quot;chico&quot; and &quot;ocho&quot;. Other digraphs represent phonemes that can also be represented by single characters. A digraph that shares its pronunciation with a single character may be a relic from an earlier period of the language when the digraph had a different pronunciation, or may represent a distinction that is made only in certain dialects, like the English . Some such digraphs are used for purely etymological reasons, like in French.

In some orthographies, digraphs (and occasionally trigraphs) are considered individual letters, which means that they have their own place in the alphabet and cannot be separated into their constituent places graphemes when sorting, abbreviating, or hyphenating words. Digraphs are used in some romanization schemes, e.g. as a romanisation of Russian .

The capitalisation of digraphs can vary, e.g. in Polish is capitalized and in Norwegian is capitalized , while in Dutch is capitalized and word initial in Irish is capitalized .

Digraphs may develop into ligatures, but this is a distinct concept: a ligature involves the graphical fusion of two characters into one, e.g. when and become , e.g. as in French &quot;heart&quot;.

==Double letters==

Digraphs may consist of two different characters (heterogeneous digraphs) or two instances of the same character (homogeneous digraphs). In the latter case, they are generally called double (or doubled) letters.

Doubled vowel letters are commonly used to indicate a long vowel sound. This is the case in Finnish and Estonian, for instance, where represents a longer version of the vowel denoted by , represents a longer version of the vowel denoted by , and so on. In Middle English, the sequences and were used in a similar way, to represent lengthened &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; sounds respectively; both spellings have been retained in modern English orthography, but the Great Vowel Shift and other historical sound changes mean that the modern pronunciations are quite different from the original ones.

Doubled consonant letters can also be used to indicate a long or geminated consonant sound. In Italian, for example, consonants written double are pronounced longer than single ones. This was the original use of doubled consonant letters in Old English, but during the Middle English and Early Modern English period, phonemic consonant length was lost and a spelling convention developed in which a doubled consonant serves to indicate that a preceding vowel is to be pronounced short. In modern English, for example, the of &quot;tapping&quot; differentiates the first vowel sound from that of &quot;taping&quot;. In rare cases, doubled consonant letters represent a true geminate consonant in modern English; this may occur when two instances of the same consonant come from different morphemes, for example in &quot;unnatural&quot; (&quot;un&quot;+&quot;natural&quot;) or in &quot;cattail&quot; (&quot;cat&quot;+&quot;tail&quot;).

In some cases, the sound represented by a doubled consonant letter is distinguished in some other way than length from the sound of the corresponding single consonant letter:
*In Welsh and Greenlandic, stands for a voiceless lateral consonant, while in Spanish and Catalan it stands for a palatal consonant.
*In several languages of western Europe, including English, French, Portuguese and Catalan, the digraph is used between vowels to represent the voiceless sibilant , since an alone between vowels normally represents the voiced sibilant .
*In Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and Basque,  is used between vowels for the alveolar trill , since an alone between vowels represents an alveolar flap (the two are different phonemes in those languages).
*In Spanish, the digraph formerly indicated (a palatal nasal); it developed into the letter ñ.
*In Basque, double consonant letters generally mark palatalized versions of the single consonant letter, as in , , . However, is a trill that contrasts with the single-letter flap, as in Spanish, and the palatal version of is written .

In several European writing systems, including the English one, the doubling of the letter or is represented as the heterogeneous digraph instead of or respectively. In native German words, the doubling of , which corresponds to , is replaced by the digraph .

==Pan-dialectical digraphs==
Some languages have a unified orthography with digraphs that represent distinct pronunciations in different dialects (diaphonemes). For example, in Breton there is a digraph that represents in most dialects, but in &quot;Vannetais.&quot; Similarly, the Saintongeais dialect of French has a digraph that represents in words that correspond to in standard French. Similarly, Catalan has a digraph that represents in Eastern Catalan, but or in Western Catalan–Valencian.

==Split digraphs==

The pair of letters making up a phoneme are not always adjacent. This is the case with English silent e. For example, the sequence &quot;a_e&quot; has the sound in English &quot;cake.&quot; This is the result of three historical sound changes: &quot;cake&quot; was originally , the open syllable came to be pronounced with a long vowel, and later the final schwa dropped off, leaving . Later still, the vowel became . There are six such digraphs in English, .

However, alphabets may also be designed with discontinuous digraphs. In the Tatar Cyrillic alphabet, for example, the letter &quot;ю&quot; is used to write both and . Usually the difference is evident from the rest of the word, but when it is not, the sequence &quot;ю...ь&quot; is used for , as in &quot;юнь&quot; &#x27;cheap&#x27;.

The Indic alphabets are distinctive for their discontinuous vowels, such as Thai เ...อ in เกอ . Technically, however, they may be considered diacritics, not full letters; whether they are digraphs is thus a matter of definition.

==Ambiguous letter sequences==

Some letter pairs should not be interpreted as digraphs but appear because of compounding: &quot;hogshead&quot; and &quot;cooperate&quot;. They are often not marked in any way and so must be memorized as exceptions. Some authors, however, indicate it either by breaking up the digraph with a hyphen, as in &quot;hogs-head&quot;, &quot;co-operate&quot;, or with a trema mark, as in &quot;coöperate&quot;, but the use of the diaeresis has declined in English within the last century. When it occurs in names such as Clapham, Townshend, and Hartshorne, it is never marked in any way. Positional alternative glyphs may help to disambiguate in certain cases: when round, was used as a final variant of long , and the English digraph for would always be .

In romanization of Japanese, the constituent sounds (morae) are usually indicated by digraphs, but some are indicated by a single letter, and some with a trigraph. The case of ambiguity is the syllabic ん, which is written as &quot;n&quot; (or sometimes &quot;m&quot;), except before vowels or &quot;y&quot; where it is followed by an apostrophe as &quot;n’&quot;. For example, the given name じゅんいちろう is romanized as Jun’ichirō, so that it is parsed as &quot;Jun-i-chi-rou&quot;, rather than as &quot;Ju-ni-chi-rou&quot;. A similar use of the apostrophe is seen in pinyin where 嫦娥 is written Chang&#x27;e because the g belongs to the final (-ang) of the first syllable, not to the initial of the second syllable. Without the apostrophe, Change would be understood as the syllable chan (final -an) followed by the syllable ge (initial g-).

==In alphabetization==
In some languages, certain digraphs and trigraphs are counted as distinct letters in themselves, and assigned to a specific place in the alphabet, separate from that of the sequence of characters that composes them, for purposes of orthography and collation:
*In the Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet used to write Serbo-Croatian, the digraphs , and , which correspond to the single Cyrillic letters , , , are treated as distinct letters.
*In the Czech and Slovak alphabet, is treated as a distinct letter, coming after in the alphabet. Also, in the Slovak alphabet the relatively rare digraphs and are treated as distinct letters.
*In the Danish and Norwegian alphabet, the former digraph , where it appears in older names, is sorted as if it were the letter , which replaced it. 
*In the Norwegian alphabet, there are several digraphs and letter combinations representing an isolated sound.
*In the Dutch alphabet, the digraph is sometimes written as a ligature and may be sorted with (in the Netherlands, though not usually in Belgium); however, regardless of where it is used, when a Dutch word starting with is capitalized, the entire digraph is capitalized (&quot;IJmeer&quot;, &quot;IJmuiden&quot;). Other Dutch digraphs are never treated as single letters.
*In Hungarian, the digraphs , , , , , , , , and the trigraph , have their own places in the alphabet (where e.g. comes right after )
*In Spanish, the digraphs and were formerly treated as distinct letters, but are now split into their constituent letters. 
*In Welsh, the alphabet includes the digraphs , , , , , , , . However, , and , which represent mutated voiceless consonants, are not treated as distinct letters.
*In the romanization of several Slavic countries that use the Cyrillic script, letters like ш, ж, and ю might be written as sh, zh and yu, however sometimes the result of the romanization might modify a letter to be a diacritical letter instead of a digraph.
*In Maltese, two digraphs are used, which comes right after , and which comes right after .

Most other languages, including most of the Romance languages, treat digraphs as combinations of separate letters for alphabetization purposes.

==Examples==

===Latin script===
====English====
English has both homogeneous digraphs (doubled letters) and heterogeneous digraphs (digraphs consisting of two different letters). Those of the latter type include the following:

* normally represents (voiceless alveolar fricative - &quot;scene&quot;) or (voiceless postalveolar fricative - &quot;conscious&quot;) before or .
* represents (velar nasal) as in &quot;thing&quot;.
* usually corresponds to (voiceless postalveolar affricate - &quot;church&quot;), to (voiceless velar plosive) when used as an etymological digraph in words of Greek origin (&quot;christ&quot;), less commonly to (voiceless postalveolar fricative) in words of French origin (&quot;champagne&quot;).
* corresponds to as in &quot;check&quot;.
* represents (voiced velar plosive) at the beginning of words (&quot;ghost&quot;), represents (voiceless labiodental fricative in &quot;enough&quot;) or is silent at the end of words (&quot;sigh&quot;).
* represents (voiceless labiodental fricative), as in &quot;siphon&quot;.
* represents English in words of Greek origin, such as &quot;rhythm&quot;.
* represents (voiceless postalveolar fricative), as in &quot;sheep&quot;.
* usually represents word-medially before a vowel, as in &quot;education&quot;.
* usually corresponds to (voiceless interdental fricative) in &quot;thin&quot; or (voiced interdental fricative) in &quot;then&quot;. See also Pronunciation of English.
* represents in some conservative dialects; in other dialects (&quot;while&quot;); and in a few words in which it is followed by , such as &quot;who&quot; and &quot;whole&quot;. See also Phonological history of.
* represents in words transliterated from Slavic languages, and in American dictionary pronunciation spelling.
* usually appears as before vowels, like in &quot;facial&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot;. Otherwise it is as in &quot;fancier&quot; and &quot;icier&quot; or as in &quot;acid&quot; and &quot;rancid&quot;.
* represents . Originally, it stood for a labialized sound, while without was non-labialized, but the distinction has been lost in most dialects, the two sounds merging into a single alveolar approximant, allophonically labialized at the start of syllables, as in &quot;red&quot; . See also rhotic consonant.
* usually represents ; is conventionally followed by and a vowel letter as in &quot;quick&quot;, with some exceptions.

Digraphs may also be composed of vowels. Some letters are preferred for the first position, others for the second . The latter have allographs in English orthography.
====Other languages using the Latin alphabet====
In Serbo-Croatian:
* corresponds to , (palatal lateral approximant)
* corresponds to (palatal nasal)
* corresponds to (voiced postalveolar affricate)
Note that in the Cyrillic orthography, those sounds are represented by single letters (љ, њ, џ).

In Czech and Slovak:
* corresponds to (voiceless velar fricative), counted as a distinct letter
* corresponds to (voiced alveolar affricate), counted as a distinct letter in Slovak, relatively rare digraph
* corresponds to (voiced postalveolar affricate), counted as a distinct letter in Slovak, relatively rare digraph

In Danish and Norwegian:
* The digraph represented until 1917 in Norway and 1948 in Denmark, but is today spelt . The digraph is still used in older names, but sorted as if it were the letter with the diacritic mark.

In Norwegian, several sounds can be represented only by a digraph or a combination of letters. They are the most common combinations, but extreme regional differences exists, especially those of the eastern dialects. A noteworthy difference is the aspiration of in eastern dialects, where it corresponds to and . Among many young people, especially in the western regions of Norway and in or around the major cities, the difference between and has been completely wiped away and are now pronounced the same.

* represents 
* represents .
* represents .
* represents .
* represents (before i or y). 
* represents as in ng in English &quot;thing&quot;.

In Catalan:
* represents (palatal lateral approximant)
* represents (palatal nasal)
* represents (post-alveolar trill)
* represents (voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant)
* represents (voiceless velar plosive)
* represents (voiced velar plosive)
* postvocalic represents (voiceless postalveolar fricative) in Eastern dialects, in Western dialects it represents .

In Dutch:

* corresponds to (see above for its possible status as a separate letter).
* represents (velar nasal)
* represents (voiceless velar fricative)
* represents (voiceless postalveolar fricative)
* represents (close front unrounded vowel)
* represents (close back rounded vowel)
* represents (close-mid front rounded vowel)

In French:
* represents (voiceless postalveolar fricative)
* represents (palatal nasal)
* represents (voiceless velar stop), typically before historic front vowels
See also French phonology.

In German:
* represents (voiceless velar fricative) or (voiceless palatal fricative)
* represents (voiceless velar plosive)
* represents (open front unrounded vowel) followed by (near-close near-front unrounded vowel)
* represents (open-mid back rounded vowel) followed by (near-close near-front rounded vowel)

In Hungarian:
* represents (voiceless postalveolar affricate)
* represents (voiced postalveolar fricative)
* represents (voiced palatal plosive)
* originally represented (palatal lateral approximant), but in the modern language stands for (palatal approximant)
* represents (palatal nasal)
* represents (voiceless palatal plosive)
* represents (voiced postalveolar affricate)
* represents (voiceless alveolar fricative) ( is pronounced )
* The Hungarian alphabet additionally contains also a trigraph, .

In Italian:
* corresponds to , (voiceless postalveolar fricative) before -i and -e (but to before other letters)
* corresponds to (only before i, e)
* corresponds to (only before i, e)
* represents , palatal lateral approximant, before -i (with some exceptions)
* represents (palatal nasal)

In Manx Gaelic, represents , but represents .

In Polish:
* corresponds to (voiceless velar fricative)
* corresponds to (voiceless retroflex affricate)
* corresponds to (voiced alveolar affricate)
* corresponds to (voiced alveolo-palatal affricate)
* corresponds to (voiced retroflex affricate)
* corresponds to (voiced retroflex fricative)
* corresponds to (voiceless retroflex fricative)

In Portuguese:
* corresponds to (voiceless postalveolar fricative)
* corresponds to (palatal lateral approximant)
* corresponds to (palatal nasal)
* usually represents (voiceless velar stop)

In Spanish:
*  is traditionally pronounced , but in dialects with yeísmo is pronounced 
* represents (voiceless postalveolar affricate). Since 2010, neither is considered part of the alphabet. They used to be sorted as separate letters, but a reform in 1994 by the Spanish Royal Academy has allowed that they be split into their constituent letters for collation. The digraph , pronounced as a distinct alveolar trill, was never officially considered to be a letter in the Spanish alphabet, and the same is true and (for and respectively before or ).

In Welsh:
* represents (velar nasal), the same sound as in English (but in some words it represents two separate letters, and is pronounced ).
* represents (voiceless uvular fricative)
* represents (voiceless alveolar trill), pronounced roughly like the combination &quot;hr&quot; (but again in some words it represents two separate letters, and is pronounced ).
* represents (voiceless interdental fricative)
* represents (voiced dental fricative), like the English in &quot;then&quot; (but is pronounced as voiceless in many contexts).
* represents (voiceless labiodental fricative), like English , since Welsh is pronounced like an English .
* also represents (voiceless labiodental fricative) but, in modern orthography, is used only for the aspirate mutation of words starting with .
* represents (voiceless alveolar lateral fricative)
The digraphs listed above represent distinct phonemes and are treated as separate letters for collation purposes. On the other hand, the digraphs , , and the trigraph , which stand for voiceless consonants but occur only at the beginning of words as a result of the nasal mutation, are not treated as separate letters, and thus are not included in the alphabet.

Daighi tongiong pingim, a transcription system used for Taiwanese Hokkien, includes or that represents (mid central vowel) or (close-mid back rounded vowel), as well as other digraphs.

In Yoruba, is a letter that represents a plosive most accurately pronounced by trying to say and at the same time.

===Cyrillic===

Modern Slavic languages written in the Cyrillic alphabet make little use of digraphs apart from for , for (in Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Bulgarian), and and for the uncommon Russian phoneme . In Russian, the sequences and do occur (mainly in loanwords) but are pronounced as combinations of an implosive (sometimes treated as an affricate) and a fricative; implosives are treated as allophones of the plosive and so those sequences are not considered to be digraphs. Cyrillic has few digraphs unless it is used to write non-Slavic languages, especially Caucasian languages.

===Arabic script===
Because vowels are not generally written, digraphs are rare in abjads like Arabic. For example, if &quot;sh&quot; were used for &quot;š,&quot; then the sequence &quot;sh&quot; could mean either &quot;ša&quot; or &quot;saha.&quot; However, digraphs are used for the aspirated and murmured consonants (those spelled with &quot;h-&quot;digraphs in Latin transcription) in languages of South Asia such as Urdu that are written in the Arabic script by a special form of the letter &quot;h&quot;, which is used only for aspiration digraphs, as can be seen with the following connecting &quot;(kh)&quot; and non-connecting &quot;(ḍh)&quot; consonants:

===Armenian===
In the Armenian language, the digraph &quot;&quot; transcribes , a convention that comes from Greek.

===Georgian===
The Georgian alphabet uses a few digraphs to write other languages. For example, in Svan, is written ჳე , and as ჳი .

===Greek===
Modern Greek has the following digraphs:
*&quot;αι&quot; (&quot;ai&quot;) represents 
*&quot;ει&quot; (&quot;ei&quot;) represents 
*&quot;οι&quot; (&quot;oi&quot;) represents 
*&quot;ου&quot; (&quot;oy&quot;) represents 
*&quot;υι&quot; (&quot;yi&quot;) represents 

They are called &quot;diphthongs&quot; in Greek; in classical times, most of them represented diphthongs, and the name has stuck.

*&quot;γγ&quot; (&quot;gg&quot;) represents or 
*&quot;τσ&quot; (&quot;ts&quot;) represents the affricate 
*&quot;τζ&quot; (&quot;tz&quot;) represents the affricate 
*Initial &quot;γκ&quot; (&quot;gk&quot;) represents 
*Initial &quot;μπ&quot; (&quot;mp&quot;) represents 
*Initial &quot;ντ&quot; (&quot;nt&quot;) represents 

Ancient Greek also had the &quot;diphthongs&quot; listed above although their pronunciation in ancient times is disputed. In addition, Ancient Greek also used the letter γ combined with a velar stop to produce the following digraphs:

*&quot;γγ&quot; (&quot;gg&quot;) represents 
*&quot;γκ&quot; (&quot;gk&quot;) represents 
*&quot;γχ&quot; (&quot;gkh&quot;) represents 

Tsakonian has a few additional digraphs:
*&quot;ρζ&quot; (&quot;rz&quot;) (historically perhaps a fricative trill)
*&quot;κχ&quot; (&quot;kkh&quot;) represents 
*&quot;τθ&quot; (&quot;tth&quot;) represents 
*&quot;πφ&quot; (&quot;pph&quot;) represents 
*&quot;σχ&quot; (&quot;skh&quot;) represents 
In addition, palatal consonants are indicated with the vowel letter &quot;ι&quot;, which is, however, largely predictable. When and are not palatalized before &quot;ι&quot;, they are written &quot;νν&quot; and &quot;λλ&quot;.

In Bactrian, the digraphs &quot;ββ&quot;, &quot;δδ&quot;, and &quot;γγ&quot; were used for , , and respectively.

===Hebrew===
In the Hebrew alphabet, and may sometimes be found for . Modern Hebrew also uses digraphs made with the symbol for non-native sounds: , , ; and other digraphs of letters when it is written without vowels: for a consonantal letter in the middle of a word, and for or , etc., that is, a consonantal letter in places where it might not have been expected. Yiddish has its own tradition of transcription and so uses different digraphs for some of the same sounds: , , , and (literally &quot;)&quot; for , , also available as a single Unicode character , or as a single character in Unicode , or , and . The single-character digraphs are called &quot;ligatures&quot; in Unicode. may also be used following a consonant to indicate palatalization in Slavic loanwords.

===Indic===
Most Indic scripts have compound vowel diacritics that cannot be predicted from their individual elements. That can be illustrated with Thai in which the diacritic เ, pronounced alone , modifies the pronunciation of other vowels:

In addition, the combination รร is pronounced or , there are some words in which the combinations ทร and ศร stand for and the letter ห, as a prefix to a consonant, changes its tonic class to high, modifying the tone of the syllable.

===Inuit===
Inuktitut syllabics adds two digraphs to Cree:
;&quot;rk&quot; for &quot;q&quot;: ᙯ &quot;qai&quot;, ᕿ &quot;qi&quot;, ᖁ &quot;qu&quot;, ᖃ &quot;qa&quot;, ᖅ &quot;q&quot;
and
;&quot;ng&quot; for &quot;ŋ&quot;: ᖕ &quot;ng&quot;
The latter forms trigraphs and tetragraphs.

===CJK Characters===
====Chinese====
Several combinations of Chinese characters (Hanzi) formed from two or more different characters that are known as digraphs.

====Japanese====
Two kana may be combined into a &quot;CV&quot; syllable by subscripting the second; the convention cancels the vowel of the first. That is commonly done for &quot;CyV&quot; syllables called &quot;yōon&quot;, as in ひょ (ひよ) &quot;hyo&quot; . They are not digraphs since they retain the normal sequential reading of the two glyphs. However, some obsolete sequences no longer retain that reading, as in くゎ &quot;kwa,&quot; ぐゎ &quot;gwa,&quot; and むゎ &quot;mwa,&quot; now pronounced &quot;ka, ga, ma&quot;. In addition, non-sequenceable digraphs are used for foreign loans that do not follow normal Japanese assibilation patterns, such as ティ &quot;ti&quot;, トゥ &quot;tu&quot;, チェ &quot;tye / che&quot;, スェ &quot;swe&quot;, ウィ &quot;wi&quot;, ツォ &quot;tso&quot;, ズィ &quot;zi&quot;. (See katakana and transcription into Japanese for complete tables.)

Long vowels are written by adding the kana for that vowel, in effect doubling it. However, long &quot;ō&quot; may be written either &quot;oo&quot; or &quot;ou&quot;, as in とうきょう &quot;toukyou&quot; &#x27;Tōkyō&#x27;. For dialects that do not distinguish &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ei&quot;, the latter spelling is used for a long &quot;e&quot;, as in へいせい &quot;heisei&quot; &#x27;Heisei&#x27;. In loanwords, &quot;chōonpu&quot;, a line following the direction of the text, as in ビール &quot;bīru&quot; &quot;bīru&quot; &#x27;beer&#x27;. With the exception of syllables starting with &quot;n&quot;, doubled consonant sounds are written by prefixing a smaller version of &quot;tsu&quot; (written っ and ッ in hiragana and katakana respectively), as in きって &quot;kitte&quot; &#x27;stamp&#x27;. Consonants beginning with n use the kana &quot;n&quot; character (written ん or ン) as a prefix instead.

There are several conventions of Okinawan kana that involve subscript digraphs or ligatures. For instance, in the University of the Ryukyu&#x27;s system, ウ is , ヲ is , but ヲゥ (ヲウ) is .

====Korean====
As was the case in Greek, Korean has vowels descended from diphthongs that are still written with two letters. Those digraphs, ㅐ and ㅔ (also ㅒ , ㅖ ), and in some dialects ㅚ and ㅟ , all end in historical ㅣ .

Hangul was designed with a digraph series to represent the &quot;muddy&quot; consonants: ㅃ , ㄸ , ㅉ , ㄲ , ㅆ , ㆅ ; also ᅇ, with an uncertain value. Those values are now obsolete, but most of the doubled letters were resurrected in the 19th century to write consonants that did not exist when hangul was devised: ㅃ , ㄸ , ㅉ , ㄲ , ㅆ .

==Ligatures and new letters==
Digraphs sometimes come to be written as a single ligature. Over time, the ligatures may evolve into new letters or letters with diacritics. For example sz became ß in German, and &quot;nn&quot; became ñ in Spanish.

==In Unicode==
Generally, a digraph is simply represented using two characters in Unicode. However, for various reasons, Unicode sometimes provides a separate code point for a digraph, encoded as a single character.

The DZ and IJ digraphs and the Serbian/Croatian digraphs DŽ, LJ, and NJ have separate code points in Unicode.
See also Ligatures in Unicode.

<text>The Islamic Renaissance Movement (, &quot;Ḥarakat An-Nahḑa Al-Islāmiyya&quot;; , MRI) is a moderate Islamist political party of Algeria.

==History==
The party was established in autumn 1990 when the Constantine-based association Jamiyat al-Nahda was transformed into a political party. Jamiyat al-Nahda had been established in 1988 by Abdallah Djaballah, and he decided to form the MRI after the Islamic Salvation Front rejected calls for an Islamic alliance. Its foundation was also a response to the FIS claim to hold a monopoly on Islamist politics.

In the 1991 parliamentary elections the party received 2.2% of the vote, failing to win a seat. The 1997 elections saw its vote share increase to 8.7%, resulting in it winning 34 of the 231 seats. However, it received just 0.6% of the vote in the 2002 elections, reducing it to a single seat. It recovered in the 2007 elections, receiving 3.4% of the vote and winning five of the 389 seats.

The party contested the 2012 elections as part of the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance. The alliance received 6.2% of the vote, winning 49 seats, down from the combined 60 won in 2007.

<doc id="403372" wikidata="Q1180909" url="?curid=403372" title="Deadlands">
<text>Deadlands is a genre-mixing alternate history role-playing game which combines the Western and horror genres, with some steampunk elements. The original game was written by Shane Lacy Hensley and published by Pinnacle Entertainment Group in 1996.

The eight-time Origins Award–winning setting has been converted to many other systems over the years and is available in the original Classic Rules, the revised Classic Rules, d20 System and GURPS adaptations, and a &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; version called &quot;&quot;.

==Development==
Shane Lacy Hensley had the idea for a new game focusing on cowboys and zombies in 1994 as he was setting up his company Pinnacle Entertainment Group, when he saw a painting by Brom of a Confederate vampire on the cover of White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s soon-to-be released &quot;&quot; supplement; he then began writing the game that became &quot;Deadlands&quot;, and after completing a first draft, Hensley flew in two game designer friends of his, Greg Gorden and Matt Forbeck, and both of them liked the game enough that they asked to buy into Pinnacle.

==Setting==
The game is set in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century. The canonical year for the first edition of &quot;Deadlands&quot; is 1876. A later supplement, &quot;Tales o&#x27; Terror&quot;, advances the game&#x27;s backstory and metaplot ahead one year, to 1877. The second edition of &quot;Deadlands&quot; uses the updated backstory of 1877 as the canonical starting point. &quot;&quot; further updates the backstory and advances the canonical starting point to 1879.

The basic rules provide for characters and settings that could be expected to appear in the &quot;Wild West&quot; genre of movies and pulp fiction, and most of the in-game action is presumed to occur in the wild frontiers of the American West, or in barely tamed frontier towns like Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas. However, later supplements expanded the in-game adventuring area to include places such as the Deep South, the Mississippi River, Mexico, and the Northeastern United States. These supplements often provide for adventures set in urban areas such as New Orleans, New York City, or Boston.

The canonical, basic setting is referred to as the &quot;Weird West&quot; due to the juxtaposition of the Western setting with the horrific and fantastical elements of the game. The history of the Weird West is identical to real-world history, up until July 3, 1863. On this date in the game, a group of American Indians from various tribes, led by a Sioux shaman known as &quot;Raven,&quot; performed a ritual in an effort to drive out the European settlers. This ritual created a conduit to a spiritual realm populated by powerful malicious entities known as the &quot;Reckoners&quot;. The events surrounding and immediately subsequent to Raven&#x27;s ritual is known as &quot;The Reckoning&quot;.

The Reckoners feed on negative emotions, particularly fear. Sufficient levels of fear in the population of a given location allow the Reckoners to begin subtly altering the environment of that location: the sun shines a little less brightly, trees become stunted and &quot;evil&quot; looking, rock formations take on the appearance of corpses or monsters, and so on. The more powerful the fear, the greater the environmental changes.

The ultimate goal of the Reckoners is to turn the entire Earth into an evil, haunted wasteland — literally a Hell on Earth. However, the Reckoners cannot directly enter Earth&#x27;s realm unless the overall fear level of the entire planet becomes sufficiently high. To this end, they use their powers to create monsters, madmen, zombies, and other creatures and villains that will sow fear and terror throughout the land.

The first instance of this occurred on July 4, 1863, at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg that had just ended; dead soldiers from both sides of the conflict rose from the battlefield and began indiscriminately attacking the surviving soldiers and civilians. Since then, undead gunslingers, hostile Indian spirits, strange cults, and deadly creatures have begun terrorizing the world. The American Civil War drags on thanks to the machinations of the Reckoners, and the country remains divided into U.S. and Confederate sections along with &quot;disputed territories&quot;. Federal agents and Texas Rangers struggle to deal with the eldritch menaces while hiding the awful truth from the general public. Seismic upheavals have pushed much of California into the ocean, creating a badlands area known as &quot;the Great Maze&quot;. In the Great Maze, miners discover &quot;ghost rock,&quot; a mineral that burns hotter and longer than coal and is used as the basis for most Deadlands technology as well as alchemical potions and semi-magical materials.

The unleashing of the Reckoners has had a number of important side effects. Magic was revealed to be real, although it involves challenging otherworldly spirits, &quot;manitous&quot;, in contests that are either viewed as a negotiation or a test of will. These same manitous can possess a recently deceased body and reanimate it, creating a &quot;Harrowed&quot;. Harrowed beings are sometimes under the control of the spirit (which uses the opportunity to spread fear) and sometimes under the control of the deceased being. Scientific progress rapidly advances as the Reckoners support experimental designs that normally would not work. This progress drives the technological level of &quot;Deadlands&quot; from historical levels to a &quot;steampunk&quot; setting.

Players take on the role of various mundane or arcane character types, including Gunfighters, Lawmen (such as U.S. Marshals or local sheriffs), Hucksters (magic users), Shamans, Blessed (those of faith), and Mad Scientists in an attempt to learn about the Reckoning and the mysterious beings behind it.

== System ==
&quot;Deadlands&quot; features a unique way of creating playing characters for the game. Instead of spending character points, or randomly rolling dice, a character&#x27;s abilities are determined by drawing cards from a standard 54-card poker deck (jokers included), which determine the character&#x27;s Traits (their basic attributes). The game also uses polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) which are referred to as the &quot;Bones&quot;, and a set of white, red, and blue poker chips called &quot;Fate Chips&quot;.

In a &quot;Deadlands&quot; game, the Game Master is called The Marshal, and the players are called The Posse.

To perform an action a player rolls for successes with a handful of dice and hopes that at least one of the dice rolls the Target Number or higher. Rolling the highest possible number on any of the dice is known as &quot;rolling an ace&quot;, and that die may be re-rolled, with the total being added to the initial roll value. In most cases only the highest single die&#x27;s value (with &quot;aces&quot; added) is compared to a target number. For each five points over the target number the character is considered to have a &quot;raise&quot; which typically makes the character&#x27;s action more effective. When attacking someone, raises give the attacker more control over where on the victim&#x27;s body the blow or bullet strikes. When attempting to quickly reload a gun, each raise allows another round of ammunition to be loaded in a single action.

===Spell casting===
Players with huckster characters use a deck of playing cards in addition to dice to cast their spells (hexes). A successful skill check allows the player to draw five or more cards and makes the best possible poker hand with those cards. The strength of the hand determines not only whether the hex was successfully cast, but also the strength of its effects. In the game world, this mechanic is explained as the huckster literally gambling with a magical spirit in order to get it to do his or her bidding — a high ranking poker hand means the huckster has won, and the spirit casts the hex as desired; a low ranking poker hand results in failure. Both jokers are present and wild, increasing the chance of a good hand, but the black joker means that the spirit does something harmful to the huckster.

Blessed characters can use their faith to invoke miracles—they pray for their patron to grant their request. The miracles are usually protective or restorative in nature, although there are some for attack. The difficulty of a given miracle (the amount of faith required by the patron for their assistance) can vary. For example, a priest seeking to heal a gunshot to the stomach would require more faith than if he were trying to mend a broken arm. Although the basic miracle set is predominantly Christian in nature, one of the extension sourcebooks includes miracles from other religions, and some of those are not permitted to Christian player characters.

Native American shamans cast spells by making deals with spirits. This happens in three stages: the shaman asks for a favor, performs the ritual that tradition demands for that favor, and then his skill is tested by the spirit. If he succeeds all three, he earns &quot;appeasement points&quot; according to how well he succeeded. If he earned enough points for the favor, it is granted. If not, his work was in vain.

===Action Decks===
Instead of rolling for Initiative as in most other RPGs, the players make a &quot;speed&quot; roll on the bones — the exact number and type being rolled determined by each character&#x27;s stats — and then draw a number of cards from a community playing card deck based on the results of that roll. The Marshal then calls out card values, starting from Aces and going all the way down to Deuces. The card&#x27;s suit (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, which is reverse alphabetical order and also the valuation in bridge) indicates who goes first if the same value of card is drawn.

===Fate Chips===
Along with Bones and Cards, characters get Fate Chips which are typically poker chips, although colored stones or coins can also be used. These are drawn from a hat or some other container that the player blindly chooses at the beginning of play. Each player draws a certain number of Fate Chips at the beginning of the game from the Fate Pot, modified according to player actions and Marshal preference. Fate chips can be spent for in-game bonuses such as bonus dice to use during certain rolls, or the prevention of physical damage. The Marshal can draw chips as well for enemies to use.

===Bounties===
At the end of a gaming session, players can cash in unused Fate Chips for Bounty Points. These are like Experience Points in other systems and are used to improve Traits and Aptitudes. The Marshal may also award additional Bounty Points at the end of the session for completing the mission objectives and any exceptional role-playing by players.

=== Instant rewards for roleplaying ===

Marshals are also encouraged to reward players with instantaneous rewards for good role-playing. During character creation players can choose &quot;Hindrances&quot; (disadvantages) such as Big Britches, Bloodthirsty, or Big Mouth. When a player role-plays this Hindrance well, the Marshal can reward them instantly with a Fate Chip. This has the effect of promoting and encouraging role-playing.

==Spinoff games==
The &quot;Weird West&quot; mark is used to distinguish the primary game setting from the various other settings:

* &quot;Deadlands: The Great Rail Wars&quot;: a tabletop wargame with miniature figures.
* &quot;Doomtown&quot;: a collectible card game. A sourcebook for the town described in the game was released under the title &quot;Doomtown or Bust!&quot;. A secondary sourcebook, detailing the town after the events of the CCG, was released under the title &quot;The Black Circle&quot;. A third sourcebook titled &quot;The Collegium&quot;, detailing the Mad Scientist faction of the same name, was also released.
* &quot;Range Wars&quot;: a tabletop wargame that used collectible cardboard disks instead of miniatures. As much a spin-off from &quot;Doomtown&quot; as &quot;Deadlands&quot;, it used many of the same factions. It is based on the &quot;Disk Wars&quot; game. The base set: &quot;Doomtown: Range Wars&quot; was released, and a single expansion, &quot;Ghost Creek&quot;. Material from this game was incorporated into the &quot;Black Circle&quot; sourcebook.
* &quot;&quot;: a role-playing game set in one possible future of the Weird West, where the Reckoners succeeded in turning the entire Earth into a haunted wasteland. This game features elements from the Western genre as well as elements from &quot;Mad Max&quot;-esque post-apocalyptic fiction and, of course, horror.
* &quot;&quot;: a role-playing game set in the same future as &quot;Deadlands: Hell on Earth&quot;, except on another planet. This game features sci-fi, Western, and horror elements.
* &quot;Deadlands: Lost Colony CCG&quot;: A collectible card game with the same setting as the Lost Colony RPG.
* &quot;Savage Worlds&quot;: a miniatures and generic role-playing game system derived from &quot;The Great Rail Wars&quot;.
* &quot;Deadlands: The Battle For Slaughter Gulch&quot;: A board game from Twilight creations.
* &quot;FRAG Deadlands&quot;: A first-person shooter themed board game in the Frag series from Steve Jackson Games.
* &quot;Deadlands&quot;: a cancelled video game developed by Headfirst Productions for the PC, Xbox and PlayStation 2.
* &quot;Deadlands Noir&quot;: Set in the same world, but in a Dieselpunk 1930s New Orleans.
Doomtown:Reloaded: The classic CCG is back in a non-collectible boxed set. Released at GenCon in August 2014 by Alderac Entertainment Group, the game (in September 2014) was already in its THIRD printing. Doomtown: Reloaded is basically the same game as the older version, (now referred to as Classic) with a number of rule revisions that have streamlined and simplified the game. The basics are the same, with minor differences. The four factions released initially were the Law Dogs, The Sloan Gang (similar to the Blackjacks), The Fourth Ring (a circus that is similar to The Whatleys) and the Morgan Cattle Company (which appears to be similar to a Sweetrock/Collegium blend).

==&quot;Deadlands: Reloaded&quot;==
In May 2006, Great White Games published a new edition of &quot;Deadlands&quot; under the company&#x27;s Pinnacle Entertainment Group label. This new edition, written by Shane Lacy Hensley and B.D. Flory and entitled &quot;Deadlands: Reloaded&quot;, used Great White Games&#x27; &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; generic role-playing system. The 256-page setting book updates the canonical setting to 1879 and includes information on the events of the past year, as well as new rules. Among the most drastic changes to the basic &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; rules was &quot;The Way of the Brave&quot; rule, which revamped the way combat works in the system, making it more dangerous and deadly for characters and increasing the effectiveness of melee combat. This book also updated Fate Chips to work with the &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; system. This book marked a first for Great White Games in that it is the first setting book published without a scripted or plot point campaign.

The publisher has hinted that four complete plot point campaign books will be released for &quot;Deadlands: Reloaded&quot;, each focusing on certain regions and events in the metaplot of the game. In 2009 the first of these campaigns, &quot;The Flood&quot;, was released. In 2012, the second of these campaigns, &quot;The Last Sons,&quot; was released. Matthew Cutter of Pinnacle has also stated that updated &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; and &quot;Lost Colony&quot; books will be published for the &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; system. The &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; update was released in 2012. Additionally, an equipment guide &quot;The Smith &amp; Robards Catalog&quot;, was published in 2011.

==Reception==
In the December 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (issue 236), Rick Swan liked the energy of the Western/horror mash-up, calling it &quot;a revolutionary mix of fantasy and cyberpunk.&quot; However, Swan criticized the lack of setting details: &quot;What we&#x27;re given is little more than an overview... there are no interesting personalities to speak of. There&#x27;s next to nothing about geography, politics, or culture. Cities, villages, places to explore—practically none. And there&#x27;s not a single ready-to-play adventure.&quot; He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 4 out of 6, saying, &quot;&quot;Deadlands&quot; is by no means bad. It&#x27;s beautifully written and bursting with nifty ideas. It strikes a masterful balance between high camp and high adventure. It has a great cover. But it&#x27;s incomplete; with a setting this skeletal and the absence of adventures, how&#x27;s a newcomer supposed to cobble together a campaign?&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted that &quot;Deadlands&quot; was emphatically a product of its time, pointing out, &quot;It is difficult to criticize a game that came out in 1996 for being too emblematic of &#x27;90s RPG design, but it&#x27;s also hard to discuss the game without constantly pointing out just how &#x27;90s it is.&quot;

<text>This article lists political parties in Morocco.

Morocco has had a multi-party system since independence in 1956 with numerous parties ranging in ideology from the far-left to Islamists. The Moroccan electoral system leads the political parties to seek coalition governments. However, the Prime Minister appointed by the King from the party that achieved a plurality in the parliamentary elections, and four other main cabinet ministers are appointed by the King of Morocco.

Since Morocco considers the disputed territory of Western Sahara to be its Southern Provinces, the political parties are also active in those parts of the territory administered by Morocco.

Mary was the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England and Queen Henrietta Maria, and sister of Charles II and James II. She was married to the future of the Netherlands, William II of Orange, in 1641 at the age of nine, while he was fourteen. Initially, she remained in England with her parents because of the heated political situation in England until early 1642, when she and her mother left for the Netherlands. Five years later in 1647, Mary&#x27;s husband inherited the titles of Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel and Groningen in the United Provinces of the Netherlands.

Eight days after her husband&#x27;s death in 1650, Mary gave birth to a son, William III of Orange, who later became King of England, Scotland and Ireland. Mary, who became the only guardian of her son, was not popular in the Netherlands because of her support of her brothers and her difficult relationship with her mother-in-law Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, who considered the princess young and inexperienced. After the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660, Mary departed for celebrations in London, where she fell ill with smallpox and died.

==Early years==

Princess Mary Henrietta was born on 4 November 1631 at St. James&#x27;s Palace, London, the third (but second surviving) child and eldest daughter of Charles I, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and his wife, Henrietta Maria of France. She was baptized on the same day of her birth, as there were fears that the newborn princess was not in good health and might die; the ceremony was presided over by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. The girl received her first name in honour of her maternal grandmother, Marie de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France. Mary&#x27;s first public appearance took place in 1640 at the baptism of her brother Henry, Duke of Gloucester; she became the only godmother of the little prince.

Mary spent the first years of her life with her brothers and sisters at St James&#x27;s Palace, as well as at Richmond Palace and Hampton Court. The education of the princesses was entrusted to the Countess of Roxburghe. Mary was known for her grace, beauty, and manners; in addition, she excelled in dancing, but her knowledge of the sciences left much to be desired. The girl&#x27;s mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, wanted to convert her daughter to Catholicism, for which she introduced a young lady who secretly professed Catholicism to Mary&#x27;s circle of friends, but King Charles I quickly stopped his wife&#x27;s actions.

In January 1640, 8-year-old Mary received her first marriage proposal from the 13-year-old William, the eldest son and heir of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. The mother of the potential groom, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, was once a lady-in-waiting and close friend of Mary&#x27;s aunt Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, which later played an important role in Mary&#x27;s life. The offer of the House of Orange was at first rejected by King Charles I, who wanted to give his daughter in marriage to Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias, only son and heir of King Philip IV of Spain and also Mary&#x27;s maternal first cousin. A prerequisite for such a union was Mary&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism, but the princess, who at the request of her mother studied the basics of the Catholic religion, did not want to change her faith. In addition, her mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, was anti-Spanish and was against an alliance with Spain. Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, Mary&#x27;s paternal first-cousin, was also a suitor for her hand, but in the end, this proposal also fell through.

== Princess consort of Orange==
By the end of the 1630s, relations between the various factions in English society had become very tense; controversies over religion, social relations, morality, and political power became more and more heated. At the same time, Mary&#x27;s mother, who openly professed Catholicism, became more and more unpopular in the country. In late 1640–early 1641, King Charles I decided to renew negotiations with Prince Frederick Henry of Orange.

The negotiations progressed quickly. On 10 February 1641, Charles announced to Parliament that the betrothal of his daughter was actually concluded and that it only remained to consider this union from a political point of view. Charles himself hoped that in case of emergency, the Prince of Orange would help him to maintain royal power in England. A modest wedding ceremony took place on 2 May 1641 at the Chapel Royal in Whitehall Palace, London. Queen Henrietta Maria was unable to attend the religious ceremony as it was a Protestant one; instead, she watched her daughter&#x27;s wedding from a small gallery. The marriage of the King&#x27;s eldest daughter was practically not celebrated in England, as the country was on the verge of a war that broke out in less than a year. The king gave her a crystal and gold casting bottle garnished with rubies and diamonds and a gold chain with the cipher &quot;AR&quot; which had belonged to Anne of Denmark.

Mary and William were congratulated by courtiers, and received several gifts; in addition, in honour of the newlyweds, a volley of 120 guns was fired. After the ceremony, William returned to the Netherlands. According to the marriage contract, Mary could remain in England until she was 12 years old, and her husband would provide her with 1,500 livres per year for personal expenses. In addition, in the event of the untimely death of William, Mary would receive a maintenance of 10,000 livres per year and two residences for her personal use. The marriage contract also provided that Mary and her English attendants could still worship in the manner of the Church of England, rather than join the Dutch Reformed Church.

In early 1642, the situation in the country heated up. Mary and her parents were forced to take refuge in Hampton Court, but the situation steadily turned into open war. In February, Queen Henrietta Maria departed with her daughter to The Hague in the Netherlands; they travelled on a Dutch fleet of fifteen ships. Mary was accompanied to the Netherlands by her governess, Lady Stanhope, who later became her confidant and companion. From a political point of view, the marriage of Mary partially paid off in 1643, when Henrietta Maria persuaded the Dutch government to provide a ship and arms for Charles, and sent them to England.

Shortly before leaving for the Netherlands, Mary was designated by her father &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, thus establishing the tradition that the eldest daughter of the British sovereign might bear this title. The title was created because Queen Henrietta Maria, the daughter of King Henry IV of France, wanted her daughter to have a title comparable to &quot;Madame Royale&quot;, the style of the eldest daughter of the King of France. Until that time, the eldest daughters of English and Scottish kings were variously titled &quot;lady&quot; or &quot;princess&quot;. The younger daughters of British sovereigns were not consistently titled princesses of Great Britain and styled &quot;Royal Highness&quot; until the accession of George I in 1714.

In November 1643, the second marriage ceremony between the 12-year-old Mary and 17-year-old William took place in The Hague. The marriage was not consummated until 1644. In February 1644, Mary completely merged into the life of the Dutch court. She gave audiences, met with foreign ambassadors, and performed all the functions assigned to her with an importance and dignity considered astonishing for her age. In March, she participated in court celebrations of the recent alliance between France and the Netherlands, and led the entertainment that her husband arranged for the French ambassador.

Mary, who was constantly receiving news from England, sympathized with her father Charles&#x27; cause. In December 1646, she sent him a letter (via a Dutch merchant ship) urging him to flee to the Netherlands, but Charles declined. In The Hague, Mary developed a very warm relationship with her aunt, Elizabeth, the exiled former Queen of Bohemia. However, Mary didn&#x27;t develop a good relationship with her mother-in-law Amalia, so she tried to minimize contact with her.

Prince Frederick Henry of Orange died on 14 March 1647. On the day of his death, Parliament was convened, which proclaimed William II to be his father&#x27;s heir as stadtholder and head of the army; one by one, the remaining titles of her late father-in-law were recognized for Mary&#x27;s husband, and he became the new Prince of Orange. In 1648, Mary was visited by her brothers, Charles, Prince of Wales, and James, Duke of York. In 1649, Mary&#x27;s father King Charles was executed; subsequently, Mary helped many English Royalist exiles. Among those who were under her patronage was the family of Anne Hyde – the future wife of the Duke of York and mother of two English Queens, Mary II and Anne.

==Co-regency==
In the autumn of 1647 Mary suffered a miscarriage, after which she could not conceive for several years. In early 1650, she was pregnant again. In late October-early November, when the princess&#x27;s pregnancy was coming to an end, her husband fell ill with smallpox and died on 6 November, just after his attempt to capture Amsterdam from his political opponents; eight days after his death, on the day of her nineteenth birthday, Mary gave birth to a son, William. The newborn prince&#x27;s cradle was draped with black cloth as a sign of mourning for his father. Since the titles of the stadtholder of the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange were not inheritable, the child did not receive them immediately after birth.

Soon after the birth of her son, Mary had several conflicts with her mother-in-law. She planned to name her son Charles in honour of her executed father, but Amalia insisted that the boy be named William, which was a better choice: the first ruler of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was William I of Orange and in addition, the boy&#x27;s late father also wanted to name his son William. Having won the battle for the name of her grandson, Amalia now wanted to become his legal guardian, referring to the fact that Mary was too young. On 13 August 1651, the &quot;Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland&quot; (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between Mary, her mother-in-law, and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg (whose wife, Louise Henriette was William II&#x27;s eldest sister); the Elector was chosen because he could act as a neutral party mediating between the two women, but also because as a possible heir he was interested in protecting the Orange family fortune, which Amalia feared Mary would squander.

In general, Mary was not popular in the Netherlands, which was more sympathetic to Oliver Cromwell; the princess herself, because of such preferences of the Dutch, refused to hire them to serve her son. In January 1650, Mary, along with her brother James and aunt Elizabeth, planned to modestly commemorate the first anniversary of her father&#x27;s death, but the Dutch government considered even modest events offensive to the English government. A little later, when envoys from the English parliament were received by the States General, Mary retired to her widow&#x27;s seat in Breda, but the influence of her party prevented the English from concluding an alliance with the Netherlands. After Mary secretly received her brother Charles II in 1651 (who considered himself the legitimate King of England), the Dutch government forbade her to accept any of her relatives. The household of Mary and her aunt was called a &quot;nest of vipers&quot;, weaving conspiracies against the Netherlands, England, and Cromwell in particular.

In 1652, the mood in the Netherlands changed due to the outbreak of war with England. Mary&#x27;s son was officially elected as stadtholder of Zealand and several northern provinces, but Johan de Witt, the republican leader, prevented William from being elected in Holland. In addition, when concluding a peace treaty, Cromwell insisted on the adoption of the Act of Seclusion, which prohibited Holland from electing a member of the Orange dynasty as stadtholder. Another requirement of Cromwell was the expulsion of all enemies of the Commonwealth from Holland. Mary made an official protest, but it was not taken into account, despite the fact that the country was threatened by civil war; the peace treaty was signed on 27 May 1654.

Mary&#x27;s worries about the position of her son affected her health. To cut her own expenses in the interests of her brothers, she announced her intention to abandon two of the four palaces at her disposal. In July 1654, she went to a water resort, where she spent a few weeks, and then went to visit her brother Charles in Cologne, where his court was located. She returned to the Netherlands in October, but in July 1655 she again went to Charles in Cologne, visited the fair in Frankfurt incognito, and returned home on 15 November. In January 1656, Mary went to Paris, where her mother and younger sister Henrietta lived, and was received with all honours at the French court.

==Later years and death==
In the Netherlands, the early widowed Mary was visited by numerous admirers and suitors, among whom was George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. According to contemporaries, Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Ernest&#x27;s brother George William also offered their hands to Mary in Paris. In addition, Cardinal Mazarin showed particular favour to the princess, and also circulated rumours that she was having an affair with (or had been secretly married to) Henry Jermyn, a member of her brother James of York&#x27;s household. The rumours were probably untrue, but Charles II took them seriously and tried to prevent any further contact between Jermyn and the princess. Mary left Paris on 21 November and after a two-month stay at her brother&#x27;s court in Bruges returned to The Hague. Soon after her return, Mary learned that her mother-in-law Amalia had offered Charles II the hand of her daughter Henriette Catherine, which deeply angered the princess. In 1658, Amalia tried to obtain the post of sole regent for her grandson, to whom Mary was also appointed by the Supreme Court, but the princess, with the support of her French relatives, thwarted the intrigues of her mother-in-law.

In November 1659, Mary sent her son to study at Leiden University. On 14 May 1660, the Dutch parliament informed Mary, who was in Breda, about the restoration of the monarchy in England and the accession to the throne of her brother Charles (henceforth King Charles II). A few days later she took part in the celebrations at The Hague on this occasion. Mary henceforth occupied the third place in the line of succession to the English throne after her brothers, James and Henry (although Henry would die later that same year). Her renewed status as an English princess, therefore, helped the attitude towards her in the Netherlands grow more tolerant: in all the cities where Mary and her son passed through or attended solemn events, they were greeted with royal honours. After the Stuart Restoration, it was proclaimed that the Act of Seclusion was void since the English Commonwealth no longer existed. In 1660, Mary, united with her mother-in-law, tried to get the states of several provinces to acknowledge William as future Stadtholder, but many refused at first.

On 30 September 1660, Mary sailed to England, where (her concern for her exiled compatriots and brothers being known) she was warmly received. Upon arrival in London, Mary discovered to her surprise and dismay that her brother the King not only recognized the marriage of James, Duke of York, with Anne Hyde, Mary&#x27;s former lady-in-waiting, but also declared that their offspring would be princes and princesses of England with full succession rights. This fact upset Mary so much that she decided to significantly shorten her visit to her homeland. She attended the official service at Whitehall Chapel, where everyone who wanted to see her flocked, and also gave a private reception at Whitehall for Elias Ashmole to see some anatomical curiosities. She accepted a monetary gift from Parliament, received in a letter dated 7 November, and asked for a long-promised dowry; to resolve this issue, the King appointed a commission. In November 1660, Mary met with the Embassy of the United Provinces, who came to renew an alliance with England. 

On 20 December the English court was stirred up by the news that Mary was seriously ill with smallpox. Having received this news, Queen Henrietta Maria arrived at the bedside of her dying daughter and made a last attempt to convert her to Catholicism, but Mary refused. The Queen managed to insist that her French doctor take over the treatment of the princess, which, as many contemporaries believed, was fatal for Mary, since the doctor was an ardent supporter of bloodletting. On 24 December, Mary signed her will and died on the same day. At her own request, she was buried in Westminster Abbey next to her brother Henry, Duke of Gloucester, who also died of smallpox in September 1660.

In her will, Mary asked the King to take care of the interests of her 10-year-old son, whose sole guardian was now his grandmother Amalia. In 1672, after several years of confrontation with republican leaders in the Netherlands, 21-year-old William was nevertheless elected stadtholder of five provinces, starting with Holland on 4 July, and named commander-in-chief. Five years later, he married his cousin Mary, the daughter of James II and Anne Hyde. In 1688, with the support of English Protestants, William deposed Mary&#x27;s father and with his wife was proclaimed co-ruler of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

<text>The Rally for Culture and Democracy (; ; , RCD) is a political party in Algeria. It promotes secularism (laïcité) and has its principal power base in Kabylia, a major Berber-speaking region. Some consider it to take the position of a liberal party for the Berber-speaking population in Algerian politics.

==History and profile==
The Rally for Culture and Democracy was founded by Saïd Sadi in 1989. He was a presidential candidate in 1995, winning 9.3 percent of the popular vote.

In 1997, the party won 19 of 390 seats. The RCD boycotted the 2002 elections. Saïd Sadi was a candidate again in the 2004 presidential election and won 1.9 percent of the vote. The party participated in the 2007 legislative elections, winning 3.36% of the vote and 19 seats.

On March 9, 2012, during an opening speech at the 4th RCD congress, Saïd Sadi announced that he would not seek a new term as president of the RCD. The doctor decided to withdraw from the presidency of his party to become a simple activist. &quot;With a clear conscience and full confidence in the future, I announce my decision not to run for the post of president of the RCD,&quot; he told the delegates.

On March 10, 2012, Mohcine Belabbas, deputy of Algiers, was elected president of the RCD, following the party congress, held in Algiers.

The RCD announced on March 20, 2021, that it would boycott the 2021 Algerian legislative elections.

In the repression against political activists that followed the Hirak, the Ministry of the Interior prohibited the RCD from using its premises to host &quot;illegal&quot; political or association meetings. On January 10, 2022, the RCD announced that its president, Mohcine Belabbas, was placed under judicial supervision by the investigating judge. In January 2022, the day after the Council of State froze the activities of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PST), the RCD declared that this decision &quot;is none other than a questioning of political pluralism and exercise, hard-won achievements&quot; and denounces &quot;the administrative and judicial relentlessness&quot; which &quot;targets&quot; it as well as its president, Mohcine Belabbas, believing that this &quot;signs an unspeakable and unacceptable authoritarian drift&quot;.

The party renews its leadership on June 3, 2022, with the election of Atmane Mazouz as party president.

== Regional strength ==
In the 2007 legislative election, support for the RCD was higher than its national average (3.36%) in the following provinces:

<doc id="403388" wikidata="Q99250" url="?curid=403388" title="Seikan Tunnel">
<text>The Seikan Tunnel (, or , ) is a dual-gauge railway tunnel in Japan, with a portion under the seabed of the Tsugaru Strait, which separates Aomori Prefecture on the main Japanese island of Honshu from the northern island of Hokkaido. The track level is about below the seabed and below sea level. The tunnel is part of the standard-gauge Hokkaido Shinkansen and the narrow-gauge Kaikyō Line of the Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido)&#x27;s Tsugaru-Kaikyō Line. The name &quot;Seikan&quot; comes from combining the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; readings of the first characters of , the nearest major city on the Honshu side of the strait, and , the nearest major city on the Hokkaido side.

The Seikan Tunnel is the world&#x27;s longest undersea tunnel by overall length (the Channel Tunnel, while shorter, has a longer undersea segment). It is also the second-deepest transport tunnel below sea level after the Ryfylke Tunnel, a road tunnel in Norway that opened in 2019, and the second longest main-line railway tunnel after the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland, opened in 2016.

==Overview==
The tunnel was constructed using conventional construction methods, including tunnel boring machine (TBM) and New Austrian tunneling method (NATM). The construction cost of the tunnel itself was 538.4 billion yen at the planning stage, but it actually cost 745.5 billion yen. The construction cost of the strait line, including the attachment line, was 689 billion yen at the planning stage, but ended up costing 900 billion yen. The number of fatalities in the construction was 34.

Unlike the start of construction during the heyday of the Seikan route, even in eastern Japan, passenger traffic to Hokkaido was already dominated by aircraft, and the construction of the Hokkaido Shinkansen was frozen when it was completed. On the freight side, due to the deterioration of labor-management relations at the JNR at the time, including the frequent strikes and legal compliance struggles, freight transportation continued to stagnate as it lost market share to ferries and coastal shipping. In addition, since the maintenance cost is large, such as the need to pump a large amount of spring water even after completion, even a huge investment is regarded as a sunk cost, and it is said that it is more economical to abandon it, and it was ridiculed variously as &quot;Showa&#x27;s Three Idiots Assessment&quot;, &quot;useless long things&quot;, and &quot;quagmire tunnel&quot;.
However, after its opening, it has played an important role in freight transportation by JR Freight between Hokkaido and Honshu, and has made 21 round trips (regular trains) a day. Including special trains, there are about 50 freight trains up and down. The effect of being able to achieve stable and safe transportation that is not affected by the weather has been significant, and in particular, the transportation volume of agricultural products, which are a key industry in Hokkaido, has increased dramatically.

==History==

The idea to connect the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido by a fixed link was proposed by the Imperial Japanese Army in the late 1920s for strategic reasons and was part of the army&#x27;s idea of linking the Japanese main islands with Japanese-held Korea and Sakhalin Islands, the latter then being divided with Japan and the Soviet Union.

The tunnel plan was handed over to the Japanese National Railway in 1946 with preliminary geological surveys and feasibility studies, induced by the loss of overseas territory at the end of World War II and the need to accommodate returnees. In 1954, five ferries, including the &quot;Tōya Maru&quot;, sank in the Tsugaru Strait during a typhoon, killing 1,430 passengers. The following year, Japanese National Railways (JNR) expedited the tunnel feasibility study. Also of concern was the increasing traffic between the two islands. A booming economy saw traffic levels on the JNR-operated Seikan Ferry double to 4,040,000 passengers/year from 1955 to 1965, and cargo levels rose 1.7 times to 6,240,000 tonnes/year.

Excavation work began in 1964. In September 1971, the decision was made to commence work on the tunnel. Drilling began in 1972 from both sides Hamana on the northern tip of Honshu and Yunosato in Hokkaido. To avoid danger from earthquakes, the tunnel goes through dense volcanic rock. A Shinkansen-capable cross section was selected, with plans to extend the Shinkansen network. Arduous construction in difficult geological conditions proceeded despite multiple challenges including drilling difficulties, tunnel floodings and the 1973 oil crisis which caused the completion of the tunnel to be delayed. Thirty-four workers were killed during construction. 

The necessity for the project was questioned at times during construction, as the 1971 traffic predictions were overestimates. Instead of the traffic rate increasing as predicted to a peak in 1985, it peaked earlier in 1978 and then proceeded to decrease. The decrease was attributed to the slowdown in Japan&#x27;s economy since the first oil crisis in 1973 and to advances made in air transport facilities and longer-range sea transport.

By mid-1982, the tunnel had only 1000 meters to complete.

On 27 January 1983, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone pressed a switch that set off a blast that completed the pilot tunnel. Similarly on 10 March 1985, Minister of Transport Tokuo Yamashita symbolically bored through the main tunnel by detonating a dynamite charge on the last few meters of the earth.

The tunnel was opened on 13 March 1988, having cost a total of ¥1.1 trillion (US$7 billion) to construct, almost 12 times the original budget, much of which was due to inflation over the years. To commemorate the event, a commemorative 500 yen coin depicting the tunnel was issued by the Japan Mint in 1988. Once the tunnel was completed, all railway transport between Honshu and Hokkaido used it, particularly conventional express trains. Similarly, the commuter ferry service between the two islands run by Japanese National Railway had also ended. However, for passenger transport, 90% of people use air travel due to the speed and cost. For example, to travel between Tokyo and Sapporo by train takes eight hours (Tokyo station and Shin-Sapporo station), with transfer from Shinkansen to narrow-gauge express train at Hakodate. By air, the journey is 1 hour and 45 minutes, or 3 hours and 30 minutes including airport access times. Deregulation and competition in Japanese domestic air travel has brought down prices on the Tokyo-Sapporo route, making rail more expensive in comparison.

The &quot;Hokutosei&quot; overnight train service began after the completion of the Seikan Tunnel; a later and more luxurious &quot;Cassiopeia&quot; overnight train service was often fully booked. Both were withdrawn following the commencement of Hokkaido Shinkansen services (in August 2015 and March 2016 respectively), with freight trains being the only regular service utilising the narrow-gauge line since that time. JR Hokkaido is exploring the use of &quot;Train on Train&quot; technology to remove the threat that the shock wave created in front of Shinkansen trains traveling at full speed poses to freight trains operating on Japanese standard narrow-gauge track in a tunnel setting. If successful, it will allow the Hokkaido Shinkansen to travel at full speed inside the tunnel in the future.

As of March 2019, Shinkansen trains operate through the tunnel to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto Station in Hakodate, connecting Tokyo and Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto stations in 3 hours and 58 minutes. Their maximum speed is within the tunnel, outside it, and to the south of Morioka. It was expected that by 2018 one daily service will be run at through the tunnel. The final stage is proposed to open to Sapporo Station in 2031 and is expected to shorten the Tokyo-Sapporo rail journey to five hours. The Hokkaido Shinkansen will be operated by JR Hokkaido.

==Surveying, construction and geology==


Surveying started in 1946 and construction began in 1971. By August 1982, less than 700 metres of the tunnel remained to be excavated. First contact between the two sides was in 1983. The Tsugaru Strait has eastern and western necks, both approximately across. Initial surveys undertaken in 1946 indicated that the eastern neck was up to deep with volcanic geology. The western neck had a maximum depth of and geology consisting mostly of sedimentary rocks of the Neogene period. The western neck was selected, with its conditions considered favourable for tunnelling.

The geology of the undersea portion of the tunnel consists of volcanic rock, pyroclastic rock, as well as sedimentary rock of the Neogene period. The area is folded into a nearly vertical syncline, which means that the youngest rock is in the centre of the strait and encountered last. Divided roughly into thirds, the Honshū side consists of volcanic rocks (notably andesite and basalt); the Hokkaido side consists of sedimentary rocks (notably Tertiary period tuff and mudstone); and the centre portion consists of Kuromatsunai strata (Tertiary period sand-like mudstone). Igneous intrusions and faults caused crushing of the rock and complicated the tunnelling procedures.

Initial geological investigation occurred from 1946 to 1963, which involved drilling the sea-bed, sonic surveys, submarine boring, observations using a mini-submarine, as well as seismic and magnetic surveys. To establish a greater understanding, a horizontal pilot boring was undertaken along the line of the service and main tunnels. Tunnelling occurred simultaneously from the northern end and the southern. The dry land portions were tackled with traditional mountain tunnelling techniques, with a single main tunnel. However, for the undersea portion, three bores were excavated with increasing diameters respectively: an initial pilot tunnel, a service tunnel, and finally the main tunnel. The service tunnel was periodically connected to the main tunnel with a series of connecting drifts, at intervals. The pilot tunnel serves as the service tunnel for the central five-kilometre portion. Beneath the Tsugaru Strait, the use of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) was abandoned after less than two kilometres () owing to the variable nature of the rock and difficulty in accessing the face for advanced grouting. Blasting with dynamite and mechanical picking were then used to excavate.

==Maintenance==
A 2002 report by Michitsugu Ikuma described, for the undersea section, that &quot;the tunnel structure appears to remain in a good condition.&quot; The amount of inflow has been decreasing with time, although it &quot;increases right after a large earthquake&quot;.
In March 2018 at 30 years of age, maintenance costs amounted to 30 billion Yen or US$286 million since 1999. Plans are to increase speed and provide mobile communication at the full track.

==Structure==
Initially, only narrow-gauge track was laid through the tunnel, but in 2005 the Hokkaido Shinkansen project started construction which included laying dual gauge track (providing standard gauge track capability) and extending the Shinkansen network through the tunnel. Shinkansen services to Hakodate commenced in March 2016, and are proposed to be extended to Sapporo by 2031. The tunnel has of continuous welded rail.

Two stations used to be within the tunnel—Tappi-Kaitei Station and Yoshioka-Kaitei Station. Both closed with the construction of the Hokkaido Shinkansen, but continue to serve as emergency escape points. In the event of a fire or other disaster, the stations provide the equivalent safety of a much shorter tunnel. The effectiveness of the escape shafts at the emergency stations is enhanced by having exhaust fans to extract smoke, television cameras to help route passengers to safety, thermal (infrared) fire alarm systems, and water spray nozzles. Before the construction of the Hokkaido Shinkansen, both stations contained museums detailing the history and function of the tunnel that could be visited on special sightseeing tours. The museums are now closed and the space provides storage for work on the Hokkaido Shinkansen. The two were the first railway stations in the world built under the sea.

<text>The Socialist Union of Popular Forces (; ; , USFP) is a social democratic political party in Morocco. Claims ideas of social justice, modernity and the fight against inequalities.

==History and profile==
The USFP was formed as a breakaway from the National Union of Popular Forces (UNFP), a socialist opposition party which had itself split from the Istiqlal Party in 1959. The USFP was established in 1975.

The party won the 1997 parliamentary election, and led the government of Morocco with a centre-left coalition. During this period, Abderrahmane Youssoufi, who led the USFP, served as the Prime Minister of Morocco.

In the parliamentary election held on 27 September 2002, the party won 50 out of 325 seats, making it the largest party in the Moroccan parliament. Following those elections, it formed a government with the Istiqlal Party in a three-party coalition known as the &quot;Koutla&quot;.

In the next parliamentary election, held on 7 September 2007, the USFP won 38 out of 325 seats, losing 12 seats and becoming only the fifth largest party in parliament. The USFP was included in the government of Prime Minister Abbas El Fassi, formed on 15 October 2007.

The USFP is a full member of the Socialist International and an observer of the Party of European Socialists.

In the run-up to the November 2011 parliamentary elections, the USFP sought to present a united front with the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) and Democratic Forces Front (FFD) to reverse the loss of support for the Moroccan left in the preceding years. The party placed fifth, with 39 seats, in the 2011 elections.

The USFP won 34 seats in the 2021 parliamentary election, an increase of 14 seats since the last election.

<doc id="403393" wikidata="Q2451552" url="?curid=403393" title="Mass society">
<text>Mass society is a concept that describes modern society as a monolithic force and yet a disaggregate collection of individuals. The term is often used pejoratively to refer to a society in which bureaucracy and impersonal institutions have replaced some notion of traditional society, leading to social alienation.

In a sense, all societies are mass societies, but the term typically refers to a developed countries that possess a mass culture and large-scale social, political and economic institutions which structure daily life for the majority of people. In modern times the term has taken on more importance and broader scope with the advent of mass media and the internet.

== History ==

Descriptions of society as a &quot;mass&quot; took form in the 19th century, referring to the leveling tendencies in the period of the Industrial Revolution that undermined traditional and aristocratic values, and replaced monarchy with various forms of liberal democracy. Political theorists such as Alexis de Tocqueville analyzed mass society and pinpointed its beginning in the French Revolution. 

Various conservative theorists developed concepts of mass society in which it replaces aristocracies with the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; or &quot;mob rule&quot; and José Ortega y Gasset, for instance, lamented the decline of high culture. Marxist accounts, such as those of the Frankfurt School, critiqued the prevailing forms of mass society as one dominated by a culture industry that served the interests of capitalism. However, Marxism-Leninism created its own form of mass society called bureaucratic collectivism by its critics. The idea of historic processes being driven exclusively by &quot;laws of dialectics&quot; highlighted the role of masses as the main field of social change, as opposed to individuals whose role is always negligible.

Mass society as an ideology can be seen as dominated by a small number of interconnected elites who control the conditions of life of the many, often by means of persuasion and manipulation. This indicates the politics of mass society theorists – they are advocates of various kinds of cultural elite who should be privileged and promoted over the masses, claiming for themselves both exemption from and leadership of the misguided masses.

&quot;As technological innovation allowed government to expand, the centralized state grew in size and importance.&quot; &quot;Since then, government has assumed responsibility for more and more areas of social life: schooling, regulating wages and working conditions, establishing standards for products of all sorts, and providing financial assistance to the elderly, the ill, and the unemployed.&quot; &quot;In a mass society, power resides in large bureaucracies, leaving people in local communities with little control over their lives. For example, state officials mandate that local schools must meet educational standards, local products must be government-certified, and every citizen must maintain extensive tax records. Although such regulations may protect and enhance social equality, they also force individuals to deal increasingly with nameless officials in distant and often unresponsive bureaucracies, and they undermine the autonomy of families and local communities.&quot;

Mass society theory has been active in a wide range of media studies, where it tends to produce ideal visions of what the mass media such as television and cinema are doing to the masses. Therefore, the mass media are necessary instruments for achieving and maintaining mass societies. &quot;The mass media give rise to national culture that washes over the traditional differences that used to set off one region from another.&quot; &quot;Mass-society theorists fear that the transformation of people of various backgrounds into a generic mass may end up dehumanizing everyone.&quot;

Sociologist C. Wright Mills made a distinction between a society of &quot;masses&quot; and &quot;public&quot;.

He states: &quot;In a public, as we may understand the term,
# virtually as many people express opinions as receive them,
# Public communications are so organized that there is a chance immediately and effectively to answer back any opinion expressed in public. 
# Opinion formed by such discussion readily finds an outlet in effective action, even against – if necessary – the prevailing system of authority. 
# And authoritative institutions do not penetrate the public, which is thus more or less autonomous in its operations.

In a mass, 
# far fewer people express opinions than receive them; for the community of public becomes an abstract collection of individuals who receive impressions from the mass media.
# The communications that prevail are so organized that it is difficult or impossible for the individual to answer back immediately or with any effect.
# The realization of opinion in action is controlled by authorities who organize and control the channels of such action.
# The mass has no autonomy from institutions; on the contrary, agents of authorized institutions penetrate this mass, reducing any autonomy it may have in the formation of opinion by discussion&quot;.

In &quot;The End of the Modern World&quot; (1957), theologian Romano Guardini wrote: &quot;to either a greater or lesser degree mass man is convinced that his conformity [with mass society] is both reasonable and just&quot;.

<text>A milkmaid, milk maid, milkwoman, dairymaid, or dairywoman is a girl or woman who works with milk or cows. 

She milks cows and also uses the milk to prepare dairy products such as cream, butter, and cheese. Many large houses employ milkmaids instead of having other staff do the work. The term &quot;milkmaid&quot; is not the female equivalent of &quot;milkman&quot; in the sense of one who delivers milk to the consumer; it is the female equivalent of &quot;milkman&quot; in the sense of &quot;cowman&quot; or &quot;dairyman&quot;. 

In 1600s-1800s English &quot;milkmaids&quot; sold milk wearing a yoke holding two milk pails and vending vessels, and also decorated themselves for the London May Day procession.&lt;ref name=&quot;kc/MM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cowpox==
As a result of exposure to cowpox, which conveys a partial immunity to the disfiguring (and often fatal) disease smallpox, it was noticed that milkmaids lacked the scarred, pockmarked complexion common to smallpox survivors. This observation led to the development of the first vaccine.

<doc id="403395" wikidata="Q5242770" url="?curid=403395" title="Day-age creationism">
<text>Day-age creationism, a type of old Earth creationism, is an interpretation of the creation accounts in Genesis. It holds that the six days referred to in the Genesis account of creation are not literal 24-hour days, but are much longer periods (from thousands to billions of years). The Genesis account is then reconciled with the age of the Earth. Proponents of the day-age theory can be found among both theistic evolutionists, who accept the scientific consensus on evolution, and progressive creationists, who reject it. The theories are said to be built on the understanding that the Hebrew word &quot;yom&quot; is also used to refer to a time period, with a beginning and an end and not necessarily that of a 24-hour day.

The differences between the young Earth interpretation of Genesis and modern scientific theories believed by some day-age creationists such as the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and common descent are significant. The young Earth interpretation says that everything in the universe and on Earth was created in six 24-hour days, estimated to have occurred some 6,000 years ago. Modern scientific observations, however, put the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years and the Earth at 4.5 billion years, with various forms of life, including humans, being formed gradually over time.

The day-age theory attempts to reconcile the Genesis creation narrative and modern science by asserting that the creation &quot;days&quot; are not literal 24-hour days, but actually lasted for long periods of time (as day-age implies, the &quot;days&quot; each lasted an age). According to this view, the sequence and duration of the creation &quot;days&quot; may be paralleled to the scientific consensus for the age of the earth and the universe.

==History==
A kind of figurative view can be traced back at least to Saint Augustine in the 5th century who pointed out, in &quot;De Genesi ad Litteram&quot; (&quot;On the Literal [Interpretation of] Genesis&quot;) that the &quot;days&quot; in Genesis could not be literal days, if only because Genesis itself tells us that the sun was not made until the fourth &quot;day&quot;.

Scottish lawyer and geologist Charles Lyell published his famous and influential work &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; in 1830–1833 which interpreted geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time and that natural processes, uniformly applied over the length of that existence (uniformitarianism), could account for what men saw and studied in creation.

In the mid 19th century, American geologist Arnold Guyot sought to harmonize science and scripture by interpreting the &quot;days&quot; of Genesis 1 as epochs in cosmic history. Similar views were held by a protégé of Lyell, John William Dawson, who was a prominent Canadian geologist and commentator, from an orthodox perspective, on science and religion in the latter part of the 19th century. Dawson was a special creationist, but not a biblical literalist, admitting that the days of creation represented long periods of time, that the Genesis flood was only &#x27;universal&#x27; from the narrator&#x27;s limited perspective, and that it was only humanity, not the Earth itself, that was of recent creation.

American geologist and seminarian George Frederick Wright was originally a leading Christian Darwinist. However reaction against higher criticism in biblical scholarship and the influence of James Dwight Dana led him to become increasingly theologically conservative. By the first decade of the 20th century he joined forces with the emerging fundamentalist movement in advocating against evolution, penning an essay for &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; entitled &quot;The Passing of Evolution&quot;. In these later years Wright believed that the &quot;days&quot; of Genesis represented geological ages and argued for the special creation of several plant and animal species &quot;and at the same time endowed them with the marvellous capacity for variation which we know they possess.&quot; His statements on whether there had been a separate special creation of humanity were contradictory.

Probably the most famous day-age creationist was American politician, anti-evolution campaigner and Scopes Trial prosecutor William Jennings Bryan. Unlike many of his conservative followers, Bryan was not a strict biblical literalist, and had no objection to &quot;evolution before man but for the fact that a concession as to the truth of evolution up to man furnishes our opponents with an argument which they are quick to use, namely, if evolution accounts for all the species up to man, does it not raise a presumption in behalf of evolution to include man?&quot; He considered defining the days in Genesis 1 to be twenty-four hours to be a pro-evolution straw man argument to make attacking creationists easier, and admitted under questioning at the Scopes trial that the world was far older than six thousand years, and that the days of creation were probably longer than twenty-four hours each.

American Baptist preacher and anti-evolution campaigner William Bell Riley, &quot;The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism&quot;, founder of the World Christian Fundamentals Association and of the Anti-Evolution League of America was another prominent day-age creationist in the first half of the 20th century, who defended this position in a famous debate with friend and prominent young Earth creationist Harry Rimmer.

One modern defender is astronomer Hugh Ross, who in 1994 wrote &quot;Creation and Time&quot; defending the day-age view in great detail, and who founded the day-age creationist ministry Reasons to Believe.
Another person who has defended the view is Rodney Whitefield.

While Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses adhere to the belief that the six days of Creation in Genesis lasted millions of years, they reject the usage of the term &quot;creationism&quot; to describe their beliefs.

==Interpretation of Genesis==
Day-Age creationists differ from young Earth creationists in how they interpret a number of crucial Hebrew words in Genesis, and thus how they interpret the genealogies and creation account contained in it.

They point out that the Hebrew words for father (&quot;&#x27;ab&quot;) and son (&quot;ben&quot;) can also mean forefather and descendent, respectively, and that the Biblical scripture occasionally &quot;telescopes&quot; genealogies to emphasise the more important ancestors. This, they argue, renders genealogically based dating of the Creation, such as the Ussher chronology, to be inaccurate.

They admit that &quot;yom&quot; can mean a twenty-four hour solar day, but argue that it can refer to an indefinitely long period of time. In their view, it is in this sense that the word is employed in Genesis 2:4, with a &quot;day&quot; of God&#x27;s total creation taking place in the course of &quot;days&quot; of creation.

Day-age creationists often point to phenomena such as the Cambrian explosion as evidence of one of the Creation &quot;days&quot; appearing in the fossil record as a long period of time.

<text>The availability heuristic, also known as availability bias, is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person&#x27;s mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. This heuristic, operating on the notion that, if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions not as readily recalled, is inherently biased toward recently acquired information.

The mental availability of an action&#x27;s consequences is positively related to those consequences&#x27; perceived magnitude. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater those consequences are often perceived to be. Most notably, people often rely on the content of their recall if its implications are not called into question by the difficulty they have in recalling it.

==Overview and history==

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began work on a series of papers examining &quot;heuristic and biases&quot; used in judgment under uncertainty. Prior to that, the predominant view in the field of human judgment was that humans are rational actors. Kahneman and Tversky explained that judgment under uncertainty often relies on a limited number of simplifying heuristics rather than extensive algorithmic processing. Soon, this idea spread beyond academic psychology, into law, medicine, and political science. This research questioned the descriptive adequacy of idealized models of judgment, and offered insights into the cognitive processes that explained human error without invoking motivated irrationality. One simplifying strategy people may rely on is the tendency to make a judgment about the frequency of an event based on how many similar instances are brought to mind. In 1973, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first studied this phenomenon and labeled it the &quot;availability heuristic&quot;. An availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person&#x27;s mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. As follows, people tend to use a readily available fact to base their beliefs on a comparably distant concept. There has been much research done with this heuristic, but studies on the issue are still questionable with regard to the underlying process. Studies illustrate that manipulations intended to increase the subjective experience of ease of recall are also likely to affect the amount of recall. Furthermore, this makes it difficult to determine whether the obtained estimates of frequency, likelihood, or typicality are based on participants&#x27; phenomenal experiences or on a biased sample of recalled information.

However, some textbooks have chosen the latter interpretation introducing the availability heuristic as &quot;one&#x27;s judgments are always based on what comes to mind&quot;. For example, if a person is asked whether there are more words in the English language that start with a k or have k as the third letter, the person will probably be able to think of more words that begin with the letter k, concluding incorrectly that k is more frequent as the first letter than the third. In this Wikipedia article itself, for example, there are multiple instances of words such as &quot;likely&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, &quot;ask&quot; and indeed &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, but (aside from names) only a couple of initial K&#x27;s: &quot;know&quot; and &quot;key&quot;.

==Research==
Chapman (1967) described a bias in the judgment of the frequency with which two events co-occur. This demonstration showed that the co-occurrence of paired stimuli resulted in participants overestimating the frequency of the pairings. To test this idea, participants were given information about several hypothetical mental patients. The data for each patient consisted of a clinical diagnosis and a drawing made by the patient. Later, participants estimated the frequency with which each diagnosis had been accompanied by various features of the drawing. The subjects vastly overestimated the frequency of this co-occurrence (such as suspiciousness and peculiar eyes). This effect was labeled the illusory correlation. Tversky and Kahneman suggested that availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. The strength of the association between two events could provide the basis for the judgment of how frequently the two events co-occur. When the association is strong, it becomes more likely to conclude that the events have been paired frequently. Strong associations will be thought of as having occurred together frequently.

In Tversky &amp; Kahneman&#x27;s first examination of availability heuristics, subjects were asked, &quot;If a random word is taken from an English text, is it more likely that the word starts with a K, or that K is the third letter?&quot; They argue that English-speaking people would immediately think of many words that begin with the letter &quot;K&quot; (kangaroo, kitchen, kale), but that it would take a more concentrated effort to think of any words in which &quot;K&quot; is the third letter (acknowledge, ask). Results indicated that participants overestimated the number of words that began with the letter &quot;K&quot; and underestimated the number of words that had &quot;K&quot; as the third letter. Tversky and Kahneman concluded that people answer questions like these by comparing the availability of the two categories and assessing how easily they can recall these instances. In other words, it is easier to think of words that begin with &quot;K&quot;, more than words with &quot;K&quot; as the third letter. Thus, people judge words beginning with a &quot;K&quot; to be a more common occurrence. In reality, however, a typical text contains twice as many words that have &quot;K&quot; as the third letter than &quot;K&quot; as the first letter.

In Tversky and Kahneman&#x27;s seminal paper, they include findings from several other studies, which also show support for the availability heuristic. Apart from their findings in the &quot;K&quot; study, they also found:
:When participants were shown two visual structures and asked to pick the structure that had more paths, participants saw more paths in the structure that had more obvious available paths. In the structure that participants chose, there were more columns and shorter obvious paths, making it more available to them. When participants were asked to complete tasks involving estimation, they would often underestimate the end result. Participants were basing their final estimation on a quick first impression of the problem. Participants particularly struggled when the problems consisted of multiple steps. This occurred because participants were basing their estimation on an initial impression. Participants failed to account for the high rate of growth in the later steps due to the impression they formed in the initial steps. This was shown again in a task that asked participants to estimate the answer to a multiplication task, in which the numbers were presented as either 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8 or 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1. Participants who were presented the equation with the larger numbers first (8x7x6...), estimated a significantly higher result than participants with the lower numbers first (1x2x3...). Participants were given a short amount of time to make the estimation, thus participants based their estimates off of what was easily available, which in this case was the first few numbers in the sequence.

== Explanations ==
Many researchers have attempted to identify the psychological process which creates the availability heuristic.

Tversky and Kahneman argue that the number of examples recalled from memory is used to infer the frequency with which such instances occur. In an experiment to test this explanation, participants listened to lists of names containing either 19 famous women and 20 less famous men or 19 famous men and 20 less famous women. Subsequently, some participants were asked to recall as many names as possible whereas others were asked to estimate whether male or female names were more frequent on the list. The names of the famous celebrities were recalled more frequently compared to those of the less famous celebrities. The majority of the participants incorrectly judged that the gender associated with more famous names had been presented more often than the gender associated with less famous names. Tversky and Kahneman argue that although the availability heuristic is an effective strategy in many situations when judging probability, use of this heuristic can lead to predictable patterns of errors.

Schwarz and his colleagues, on the other hand, proposed the &quot;ease of retrieval&quot; explanation, wherein the ease with which examples come to mind, not the number of examples, is used to infer the frequency of a given class. In a study by Schwarz and colleagues to test their explanation, participants were asked to recall either six or twelve examples of their assertive or very unassertive behavior. Participants were later asked to rate their own assertiveness. Pretesting had indicated that although most participants were capable of generating twelve examples, this was a difficult task. The results indicated that participants rated themselves as more assertive after describing six examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior, but rated themselves as less assertive after describing twelve examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior. The study reflected that the extent to which recalled content impacted judgment was determined by the ease with which the content could be brought to mind (it was easier to recall 6 examples than 12), rather than the amount of content brought to mind.

Research by Vaughn (1999) looked at the effects of uncertainty on the use of the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would ask the students to complete the questionnaire. Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on the last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in their easiest and hardest classes. Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grades at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of the availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results indicated that students used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on their hardest final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on their hardest final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of the study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic.

==Applications==

===Media===
After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the likelihood of this event is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a person&#x27;s example bias with widespread and extensive coverage of unusual events, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more routine, less sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents. For example, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate &quot;newsworthy&quot; events as more likely because they can more readily recall an example from memory. Moreover, unusual and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and un-sensational causes of death like common diseases.

For example, many people think that the likelihood of dying from shark attacks is greater than that of dying from being hit by falling airplane parts when more people actually die from falling airplane parts. When a shark attack occurs, the deaths are widely reported in the media whereas deaths as a result of being hit by falling airplane parts are rarely reported in the media.

In a 2010 study exploring how vivid television portrayals are used when forming social reality judgments, people watching vivid violent media gave higher estimates of the prevalence of crime and police immorality in the real world than those not exposed to vivid television. These results suggest that television violence does in fact have a direct causal impact on participants&#x27; social reality beliefs. Repeated exposure to vivid violence leads to an increase in people&#x27;s risk estimates about the prevalence of crime and violence in the real world. Counter to these findings, researchers from a similar study argued that these effects may be due to effects of new information. Researchers tested the new information effect by showing movies depicting dramatic risk events and measuring their risk assessment after the film. Contrary to previous research, there were no long-term effects on risk perception due to exposure to dramatic movies. However, the study did find evidence of idiosyncratic effects of the movies - that is, people reacted immediately after the movies with enhanced or diminished risk beliefs, which faded after a period of 10 days.

Another measurable effect is the inaccurate estimation of the fraction of deaths caused by terrorism compared to homicides with other causes.

===Health===
Researchers examined the role of cognitive heuristics in the AIDS risk-assessment process. 331 physicians reported worry about on-the-job HIV exposure, and experience with patients who have HIV. By analyzing answers to questionnaires handed out, researchers concluded that availability of AIDS information did not relate strongly to perceived risk.

Participants in a 1992 study read case descriptions of hypothetical patients who varied on their sex and sexual preference. These hypothetical patients showed symptoms that could have been caused by five different diseases (AIDS, leukemia, influenza, meningitis, or appendicitis). Participants were instructed to indicate which disease they thought the patient had and then they rated patient responsibility and interaction desirability. Consistent with the availability heuristic, either the more common (influenza) or the more publicized (AIDS) disease was chosen.

===Business and economy===
One study sought to analyze the role of the availability heuristic in financial markets. Researchers defined and tested two aspects of the availability heuristic:

* Outcome Availability – availability of positive and negative investment outcomes, and
* Risk Availability – availability of financial risk.

On days of substantial stock market moves, abnormal stock price reactions to upgrades are weaker, than those to downgrades. These availability effects are still significant even after controlling for event-specific and company-specific factors.

Similarly, research has pointed out that under the availability heuristic, humans are not reliable because they assess probabilities by giving more weight to current or easily recalled information instead of processing all relevant information. Since information regarding the current state of the economy is readily available, researchers attempted to expose the properties of business cycles to predict the availability bias in analysts&#x27; growth forecasts. They showed the availability heuristic to play a role in analysis of forecasts and influence investments because of this.

In effect, investors are using the availability heuristic to make decisions and subsequently, may be obstructing their own investment success. An investor&#x27;s lingering perceptions of a dire market environment may be causing them to view investment opportunities through an overly negative lens, making it less appealing to consider taking on investment risk, no matter how small the returns on perceived &quot;safe&quot; investments. To illustrate, Franklin Templeton&#x27;s annual Global Investor Sentiment Survey 1 asked individuals how they believed the S&amp;P 500 Index performed in 2009, 2010, and 2011. 66 percent of respondents stated that they believed the market was either flat or down in 2009, 48 percent said the same about 2010 and 53 percent also said the same about 2011. In reality, the S&amp;P 500 saw 26.5 percent annual returns in 2009, 15.1 percent annual returns in 2010, and 2.1 percent annual returns in 2011, meaning lingering perceptions based on dramatic, painful events are impacting decision-making even when those events are over.

Additionally, a study by Hayibor and Wasieleski found that the availability of others who believe that a particular act is morally acceptable is positively related to others&#x27; perceptions of the morality of that act. This suggests that availability heuristic also has an effect on ethical decision making and ethical behavior in organizations.

===Education===
A study done by Craig R. Fox provides an example of how availability heuristics can work in the classroom. In this study, Fox tests whether the difficulty of recall influences judgment, specifically with course evaluations among college students. In his study he had two groups complete a course evaluation form. He asked the first group to write two recommended improvements for the course (a relatively easy task) and then write two positives about the class. The second group was asked to write ten suggestions where the professor could improve (a relatively difficult task) and then write two positive comments about the course. At the end of the evaluation, both groups were asked to rate the course on a scale from one to seven. The results showed that students asked to write ten suggestions (difficult task) rated the course less harshly because it was more difficult for them to recall the information. Most of the students in the group that was asked to fill in 10 suggestions didn&#x27;t fill in more than two being unable to recall more instances where they were unsatisfied with the class. Students asked to do the easier evaluation with only two complaints had less difficulty in terms of availability of information, so they rated the course more harshly.

Another study by Marie Geurten sought to test the availability heuristic in young children. Children of varying ages (from 4 to 8 years old) were tasked with generating a list of names, with some being asked for a shorter list and some for a longer list. The study then assessed the children&#x27;s own impressions of their ability to recall names. Those children who were tasked with generating a shorter list had a higher perception of their ability to recall names than those who were tasked with generating a longer list. According to the study, this suggests that the children based their assessment of their recall abilities on their subjective experience of ease of recall.

===Criminal justice===
The media usually focuses on violent or extreme cases, which are more readily available in the public&#x27;s mind. This may come into play when it is time for the judicial system to evaluate and determine the proper punishment for a crime. In one study, respondents rated how much they agreed with hypothetical laws and policies such as &quot;Would you support a law that required all offenders convicted of unarmed muggings to serve a minimum prison term of two years?&quot; Participants then read cases and rated each case on several questions about punishment. As hypothesized, respondents recalled more easily from long-term memory stories that contain severe harm, which seemed to influence their sentencing choices to make them push for harsher punishments. This can be eliminated by adding high concrete or high contextually distinct details into the crime stories about less severe injuries.

A similar study asked jurors and college students to choose sentences on four severe criminal cases in which prison was a possible but not an inevitable sentencing outcome. Respondents answering questions about court performance on a public opinion formulated a picture of what the courts do and then evaluated the appropriateness of that behavior. Respondents recalled public information about crime and sentencing. This type of information is incomplete because the news media present a highly selective and non-representative selection of crime, focusing on the violent and extreme, rather than the ordinary. This makes most people think that judges are too lenient. But, when asked to choose the punishments, the sentences given by students were equal to or less severe than those given by judges. In other words, the availability heuristic made people believe that judges and jurors were too lenient in the courtroom, but the participants gave similar sentences when placed in the position of the judge, suggesting that the information they recalled was not correct.

Researchers in 1989 predicted that mock jurors would rate a witness to be &quot;more&quot; deceptive if the witness testified truthfully &quot;before&quot; lying than when the witness was caught lying first before telling the truth. If the availability heuristic played a role in this, lying second would remain in jurors&#x27; minds (since it was more recent) and they would most likely remember the witness lying over the truthfulness. To test the hypothesis, 312 university students played the roles of mock jurors and watched a videotape of a witness presenting testimony during a trial. Results confirmed the hypothesis, as mock jurors were most influenced by the most recent act.

===Perceived risk===

Previous studies have indicated that explaining a hypothetical event makes the event seem more likely through the creation of causal connections. However, such effects could arise through the use of the availability heuristic; that is, subjective likelihood is increased by an event becoming easier to imagine.

A study done asked those participating to pick between two illnesses. Those doing the study wanted to know which disease they thought was more likely to cause death. In the study, they asked participants to choose between a stroke and asthma as to which one someone was more likely to die from. The researchers concluded that it depended on what experiences were available to them. If they knew someone or heard of someone that died from one of the diseases that is the one they perceived to be a higher risk to die from.

===Vividness effects===
Two studies with 108 undergraduates investigated vivid information and its impact on social judgment and the availability heuristic and its role in mediating vividness effects.

In study 1, Subjects listened to a tape recording that described a woman who lived with her 7-year-old son. Subjects then heard arguments about the woman&#x27;s fitness as a parent and were asked to draw their own conclusions regarding her fitness or unfitness. The concrete and colorful language were found to influence judgments about the woman&#x27;s fitness as a mother.

In study 2, a series of male and female names were presented to subjects; for each name, subjects were told the university affiliation of the individual (Yale or Stanford). When some names were presented, subjects were simultaneously shown a photograph that purportedly portrayed the named individual. Subsequently, to assess what subjects could remember (as a measure of availability), each name was represented, as well as the appropriate photograph if one had been originally presented. The study considered whether the display or non-display of photographs biased subjects&#x27; estimates as to the percentage of Yale (vs Stanford) students in the sample of men and women whose names appeared on the original list, and whether these estimated percentages were causally related to the respondents&#x27; memory for the college affiliations of the individual students on the list. The presence of photographs affected judgments about the proportion of male and female students at the two universities. Such effects have typically been attributed to the ready accessibility of vividly presented information in memory—that is, to the availability heuristic.

In both studies, vividness affected both availability (ability to recall) and judgments. However, causal modeling results indicated that the availability heuristic did not play a role in the judgment process.

===Judging frequency and probability===
In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatoric outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias.

In the original Tversky and Kahneman (1973) research, three major factors that are discussed are the frequency of repetition, frequency of co-occurrence, and illusory correlation. The use of frequency of repetition aids in the retrieval of relevant instances. The idea behind this phenomenon is that the more an instance is repeated within a category or list, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. Individuals then use the strong association between the instances to determine the frequency of an instance. Consequently, the association between the category or list and the specific instance often influences frequency judgement. Frequency of co-occurrence strongly relates to Frequency of repetition, such that the more an item-pair is repeated, the stronger the association between the two items becomes, leading to a bias when estimating the frequency of co-occurrence. Due to the phenomena of frequency of co-occurrence, illusory correlations also often play a big role.

Another factor that affects the availability heuristic in frequency and probability is exemplars. Exemplars are the typical examples that stand out during the process of recall. If asked what participants thought different set sizes were (how many men and how many women are in the class), participants would use exemplars to determine the size of each set. Participants would derive their answers on ease of recall of the names that stood out. Participants read a list of names of members of a class for 30 seconds, and then participants were asked the male to female ratio of the class. The participant&#x27;s answer would depend on the recall of exemplars. If the participant reading the list recalled seeing more common male names, such as Jack, but the only female names in the class were uncommon names, such as Deepika, then the participant will recall that there were more men than women. The opposite would be true if there were more common female names on the list and uncommon male names. Due to the availability heuristic, names that are more easily available are more likely to be recalled, and can thus alter judgments of probability.

Another example of the availability heuristic and exemplars would be seeing a shark in the ocean. Seeing a shark has a greater impact on an individual&#x27;s memory than seeing a dolphin. If someone sees both sharks and dolphins in the ocean, they will be less aware of seeing the dolphins, because the dolphins had less of an impact on their memory. Due to the greater impact of seeing a shark, the availability heuristic can influence the probability judgement of the ratio of sharks and dolphins in the water. Thus, an individual who saw both a shark and a dolphin would assume a higher ratio of sharks in the water, even if there are more dolphins in reality.

==Critiques==

=== Ease of recall as a critique ===
One of the earliest and most powerful critiques of the original Tversky and Kahneman study on the availability heuristic was the Schwarz et al. study which found that the ease of recall was a key component in determining whether a concept became available. Many studies since this criticism of the original availability heuristic model have repeated this initial criticism, that the ease of recall factor became an integral facet of the availability heuristic itself (see Research section).

=== Alternative explanations ===
Much of the criticism against the availability heuristic has claimed that making use of the content that becomes available in our mind is not based on the ease of recall as suggested by Schwarz et al. For example, it could be argued that recalling more words that begin with K than words with the third letter being K could arise from how we categorize and process words into our memory. If we categorize words by the first letter and recall them through the same process, this would show more support for the representative heuristic than the availability heuristic. Based on the possibility of explanations such as these, some researchers have claimed that the classic studies on the availability heuristic are too vague in that they fail to account for people&#x27;s underlying mental processes. Indeed, a study conducted by Wanke et al. demonstrated this scenario can occur in situations used to test the availability heuristic.

A second line of study has shown that frequency estimation may not be the only strategy we use when making frequency judgments. A recent line of research has shown that our situational working memory can access long-term memories, and this memory retrieval process includes the ability to determine more accurate probabilities.

<doc id="403399" wikidata="Q734545" url="?curid=403399" title="Islamic Salvation Front">
<text>The Islamic Salvation Front (; , FIS) was an Islamist political party in Algeria. The party had two major leaders representing its two bases of its support; Abbassi Madani appealed to pious small businessmen, and Ali Belhadj appealed to the angry, often unemployed youth of Algeria.

Officially made legal as a political party in September 1989, less than a year later the FIS received more than half of valid votes cast by Algerians in the 1990 local government elections. When it appeared to be winning a general election in January 1992, a military coup dismantled the party, interning thousands of its officials in the Sahara. It was officially banned two months later. Its armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), fought in the Algerian Civil War against the Algerian government from July 1994 until its dissolution in January 2000.

== Goals ==

The founders and leaders of the FIS did not agree on all issues, but agreed on the core objective of establishing an Islamic State ruled by sharia law. FIS hurriedly assembled a platform in 1989, the &quot;Projet de Programme du Front Islamique du Salut&quot;, which was widely criticized as vague.

Its 1990 electoral victory, giving it control of many local governments, led to the imposing of the veil on female municipal employees, pressuring of liquor stores, video shops and other establishments perceived as un-Islamic to close, and segregation of bathing areas by gender.

Elimination of the French language and culture was an important issue for many in the FIS such as co-leader Ali Benhadj, who in 1990 declared his intention &quot;to ban France from Algeria intellectually and ideologically, and be done, once and for all, with those whom France has nursed with her poisoned milk.&quot; Devout activists removed satellite dishes of households receiving European satellite broadcast in favor of Arab satellite dishes receiving Saudi broadcasts. Educationally, the party was committed to continue the Arabization of the educational system by shifting the language of instruction in more institutions, such as medical and technological schools, from French to Arabic. Large numbers of recent graduates, the first post-independence generation educated mainly in Arabic, liked this measure, as they had found the continued use of French in higher education and public life jarring and disadvantageous.

Following the first National Assembly ballot, the FIS issued a second pamphlet. Economically, it strongly criticized Algeria&#x27;s planned economy, urging the need to protect the private sector and encourage competition – earning it support from traders and small businessmen – and urged the establishment of Islamic banking. However, leaders Abbassi Madani and Abdelkader Hachani both made statements opposed to opening the country to competition from foreign business.

Socially, it suggested that women should be given a financial incentive to stay at home rather than working outside, thus introducing sexual segregation (Ali Belhadj called it immoral for men and women to work in the same office) with the supposed goal of increasing the number of jobs available to men in a time of chronic unemployment.

Politically, the contradiction between Madani and Belhadj&#x27;s words was noteworthy: Madani condemned violence &quot;from wherever it came&quot;, and expressed his commitment to democracy and resolve to &quot;respect the minority, even if it is composed of one vote&quot;.

Belhadj said, &quot;There is no democracy in Islam&quot; and &quot;If people vote against the Law of God... this is nothing other than blasphemy. The ulama will order the death of the offenders who have substituted their authority for that of God&quot;.

In an interview with Daniel Pipes and Patrick Clawson, Anwar Haddam rejected this view of Belhadj, saying, &quot;He has been misquoted. He has been accused of things out of bitterness. He wrote a book in which he expressed himself clearly in favor of democracy. In it, he writes on page 91 that &quot;the West progressed by defeating tyranny and preserving freedoms; this is the secret of the Western world&#x27;s remarkable progress.&quot; Belhadj refers many times to the Western world and to those very values that people are trying to deny us within our own borders.&quot;

== History ==
=== Background ===
Social conditions that led to formation and popularity of the FIS included a population explosion in the 1960s and 70s that outstripped the stagnant economy&#x27;s ability to supply jobs, housing, food and urban infrastructure to massive numbers of young in the urban areas; a collapse in price of oil, whose sale supplied 95% of Algeria&#x27;s exports and 60% of the government&#x27;s budget; a single-party state ostensibly based on socialism, anti-imperialism, and popular democracy but ruled by high level military and party &quot;nomenklatura&quot; from the east side of the country; &quot;corruption on a grand scale&quot;; and in response to these issues, &quot;the most serious riots since independence&quot; occurred in October 1988 when thousands of urban youth took control of the streets.

Earlier Salafist movements in Algeria included the Association of Muslim Ulemas founded in 1931 by Abdel Hamid Ben Badis, which like the Muslim Brotherhood believed that religion should be the &quot;absolute focus of private life and society&quot;, preached against the &quot;superstitions&quot; of popular Islam and French culture or secularism in Algeria, but did not venture into politics or promotion of an Islamic state.

After independence the government of Houari Boumediene began a campaign of Arabization and Islamization against the French language which was still dominant in higher education and the professions. It recruited Egyptians to Arabize and de-Frenchify the school system, including a substantial number of Muslim Brotherhood members. Many of the generation of &quot;strictly Arabphone teachers&quot; trained by the Brothers adopted the beliefs of their teachers and went on to form the basis of an &quot;Islamist intelligentsia&quot; that made up the FIS (Ali Belhadj being a prime example).

In the 1980s the government imported two renowned Islamic scholars, Mohammed al-Ghazali and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, to &quot;strengthen the religious dimension&quot; of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party&#x27;s &quot;nationalist ideology&quot;. However, both clerics were &quot;fellow travelers&quot; of the Muslim Brotherhood, supporters of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies, and supported &quot;Islamic awakening&quot; in Algeria, giving only &quot;lip service&quot; to the government.

Another Islamist, Mustafa Bouyali, a &quot;gifted inflammatory preacher&quot; and veteran of the Algerian independence struggle, called for the application of the &quot;sharia&quot; and creating of an Islamic state by &quot;jihad&quot;. After persecution by the security services he founded the &quot;Mouvement Islamique Arme&quot; (MIA), &quot;a loose association of tiny groups&quot;, with himself as &quot;amir&quot; in 1982. His group carried out a series of &quot;bold attacks&quot; against the regime and was able to carry it fight on underground for five years before Bouyali was killed in February 1987.

Also in the 1980s, several hundred youth left Algeria for camps of Peshawar to fight jihad in Afghanistan. As Algeria was a close ally of the jihadists&#x27; enemy the Soviet Union, these jihadists tended to consider the Afghan jihad a &quot;prelude&quot; to jihad against the Algerian FLN. After the Marxist government in Afghanistan fell, many of the Salafist jihadis returned to Algeria and supported the FIS and later the GIA.

Also adding to the strength of salafist &quot;Islamic revivalism&quot; and political Islam in Algeria was the weakness (or nonexistence) of any alternative in the form of popular Muslim brotherhoods which had been dismantled by the FLN government in retaliation for lack of support and whose land had been confiscated and redistributed by the FLN government after independence.

During and after the 1988 October Riots, Islamists &quot;set about building bridges to the young urban poor&quot;. The riots &quot;petered out&quot; after meetings between the President Chadli and Islamists Ali Belhadj and members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

=== Founding ===
On 3 November 1988, the Algerian Constitution was amended to allow parties other than the ruling FLN to operate legally. The FIS was born shortly afterwards in Algiers on 18 February 1989, led by an elderly sheikh, Abbassi Madani, and a charismatic young mosque preacher, Ali Belhadj. Its views ranged across a wide (but not complete) spectrum of Islamist opinion, exemplified by its two leaders. Abbassi Madani, a professor at University of Algiers and ex-independence fighter, represented a relatively moderate religious conservatism and symbolically connected the party to the Algerian War of Independence, the traditionally emphasized source of the ruling FLN&#x27;s legitimacy. His aim was to &quot;Islamise the regime without altering society&#x27;s basic fabric.&quot; The party came into legal existence on 16 September 1989.

Ali Belhadj, a high school teacher, appealed to a younger and less educated class. An impassioned orator, he was known for his ability to both enrage and calm at will the tens of thousands of young &quot;hittiestes&quot; who came to hear him speak. However, his radical speeches alarmed non-Islamists and feminists. He purportedly represented a Salafi mindset. Madani sometimes expressed support for multiparty democracy, whereas Belhadj denounced it as a potential threat to sharia. Their support of free market trading and opposition to the ruling elite also attracted middle class traders, who felt left out of the economy.

As in other Muslim countries where the political system allowed opposition and free elections for the first time, the FIS benefited from being a religious party. Unlike the secular parties it had &quot;a coherent network of preachers already in place.&quot;
Its support base increased rapidly with the help of activists preaching in friendly mosques.

=== 1990 local elections victory ===
The FIS made &quot;spectacular&quot; progress in the first year of its existence. The first edition of its weekly publication, &quot;Al Munqidh&quot;, was distributed to 200,000. The FIS-inspired doctors, nurses and rescue teams showed &quot;devotion and effectiveness&quot; helping victims of an earthquake in Tipaza Province. It organized marches and rallies and &quot;applied steady pressure on the state&quot; to force a promise of early elections.

In the first free elections since independence on 12 June 1990, they swept the local elections with 54% of votes cast, almost double that of the FLN and far more than any of the other parties. The FIS took 46% of town assemblies and 55% of wilaya assemblies. Its supporters were especially concentrated in urban areas: it secured 93% of towns/cities of over 50,000. This was the &quot;high point&quot; of FIS influence. Its rapid rise alarmed the government, which moved to curtail the powers of local government.

Once in power in local governments, its administration and its Islamic charity was praised by many as just, equitable, orderly and virtuous, in contrast to its corrupt, wasteful, arbitrary and inefficient FLN predecessors.

The victory in local elections was the &quot;high point&quot; of FIS influence, which benefited from widespread disillusionment with the Algerian ruling party. As time went on non-core supporters began to become disenchanted. The secular, educated, salaried urban middle class began to be concerned over the anti-French language policy.

The Gulf War energized the party, but brought fissures. The FIS had condemned Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, but once it was apparent that Western intervention was inevitable, public opinion shifted and there were massive demonstrations, blood donation drives. When Benhadj delivered a speech in front of the Ministry of Defense building demanding a corp be sent to fight in Iraq&#x27;s favor, the military took it as a &quot;direct affront&quot; and challenge to the discipline in the armed forces. (Benhadj later appealed unsuccessfully to the armed forces rank and file for a general mutiny.) Furthermore, his co-leader Madani had received much aid from Iraq&#x27;s direct enemies, Saudi Arabia and other oil monarchies, supported them and was unhappy about having to defer to Benhadj and the pro-Sadam position.

=== General strike and arrests of leadership ===
In May 1991, the FIS called for a general strike to protest the government&#x27;s redrawing of electoral districts, which it saw as gerrymandering directed against it. The strike itself was a failure, but the demonstrations FIS organized in Algiers were huge. Mass sit-ins were held in one of Algiers largest squares for a week, and the FIS succeeded in pressuring the government. It was persuaded in June to call the strike off by the promise of fair parliamentary elections.

However, disagreements on the strike provoked open dissension among the FIS leadership (the &quot;Madjliss ech-Choura&quot;), and the prolonged demonstrations alarmed the military. Shortly afterwards the government arrested Madani and Belhadj on 30 June 1991, having already arrested a number of lower-ranking members. The party, however, remained legal in the meantime, and passed to the effective leadership of &quot;djazarists&quot; led by Abdelkader Hachani after four days of contested leadership by Mohamed Said (who was then arrested).

Despite activists anger that its demands for the leaders&#x27; release went unheeded, after some deliberation (and expulsion of dissenters such as Said Mekhloufi and Kamareddine Kherbane who advocated direct action against the government), the FIS agreed to participate in the next elections. On 26 December 1991, the FIS won the first round of parliamentary elections, although with one million fewer votes than in the earlier local elections. It won 48% of the overall popular vote, and 188 of the 231 seats contested in that round, putting them far ahead of rivals.

The army saw the seeming certainty of resulting FIS rule as unacceptable. On 11 January 1992, it cancelled the electoral process, forcing President Chadli Bendjedid to resign and bringing in the exiled independence fighter Mohammed Boudiaf to serve as a new president. Many FIS members were arrested, including FIS number three leader Abdelkader Hachani on 22 January. A state of emergency was declared on 9 February, and the government officially dissolved FIS on 4 March. On 12 July, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj were sentenced to 12 years in prison.

40,000 FIS militants and elected FIS officials were interned in tents deep in the Sahara. Mosques were placed under &quot;tight surveillance&quot;. Such activists as remained at large took this as a declaration of war, though FIS would not officially call for armed resistance until 1993, attempting to steer a nuanced course of expressing sympathy for the guerrillas without endorsing their actions.

=== Civil war ===
Many took to the hills and joined guerrilla groups. The country inexorably slid into a civil war which would claim more than 250,000 lives, from which it only began to emerge at the end of the 1990s. Initially, the guerrillas were led by members of non-FIS groups, such as Mustafa Bouyali&#x27;s supporters and people who had fought in Afghanistan, although FIS itself established an underground network, led by Mohamed Said and Abderrezak Redjam, setting up clandestine newspapers and even a radio station with close links to the MIA. From late 1992, they also began issuing official statements from abroad, led by Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam.

Soon after taking office in 1994, Liamine Zeroual began negotiations with the imprisoned FIS leadership, releasing some prisoners (including such figures as Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Boukhamkham) by way of encouragement. These first negotiations collapsed in March, as each accused the other of reneging on agreements; but further, initially secret, negotiations would take place over the following months.

==== Founding of the Islamic Salvation Army ====

As the radical Armed Islamic Group (&quot;Groupe Islamique Armé&quot; or GIA), hostile to FIS as well as to the government, rose to the forefront, FIS-loyalist guerrillas, threatened with marginalization, attempted to unite their forces. In July 1994, the MIA, together with the remainder of the MEI and a variety of smaller groups, united as the Islamic Salvation Army (or AIS, a term that had previously sometimes been used as a general label for pro-FIS guerrillas), declaring their allegiance to FIS and thus strengthening FIS&#x27; hand for the negotiations. It was initially headed by MIA&#x27;s Abdelkader Chebouti, who was superseded in November 1994 by MEI&#x27;s Madani Mezrag.

It rejected all truces and compromises with the government. The AIS favored a long-term jihad directed against the state and its representatives, not civilians. The GIA appealed to the &quot;hittistes&quot; urban youth, while the AIS support came from the pious middle class.

By the end of 1994, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) controlled over half the guerrillas of the east and west, but barely 20% in the center, near the capital, where the GIA were mainly based. Their main leadership was based in the Beni Khettab mountains near Jijel. It issued communiqués condemning the GIA&#x27;s indiscriminate targeting of women, journalists, and other civilians &quot;not involved in the repression&quot;, and attacking its school arson campaign.

Meanwhile, following letters from Madani and Belhadj expressing a commitment to pluralistic democracy and proposing possible solutions to the crisis, the government released both from jail to house arrest on 13 September. However, no let up was observed in the fighting, and the government was unwilling to allow them to consult with FIS figures that remained in prison; the negotiations soon foundered, and at the end of October the government announced the failure of the second round of negotiations, and published incriminating letters from Belhadj that were allegedly found on the body of GIA leader Cherif Gousmi, who had been killed on 26 September.

=== Work in exile ===
A few FIS leaders, notably Rabah Kebir, had escaped into exile abroad. During 1994, they carried out negotiations in Italy with other political parties, notably the FLN and FFS, and came out with a mutual agreement on 14 January 1995: the Sant&#x27;Egidio platform. This set forth a set of principles: respect for human rights and multiparty democracy, rejection of army rule and dictatorship, recognition of Islam, Arabness, and Berberness as essential aspects of Algerianness, demand for the release of FIS leaders, and an end to extrajudicial killing and torture on all sides. To the surprise of many, even Ali Belhadj endorsed the agreement. However, a crucial signatory was missing: the government itself. As a result, the platform had little if any effect.

Despite the government&#x27;s extremely hostile reaction to the Rome Platform, though, a third attempt at negotiations took place, starting in April with a letter from Madani condemning acts of violence, and hopes were raised. However, the FIS did not offer enough concessions to satisfy the government, demanding, as usual, that FIS leaders should be released before FIS could call for a ceasefire. In July Zeroual announced that the talks had failed, for the last time.

In 1995, the GIA turned on the AIS in earnest. Reports of battles between the AIS and GIA increased (resulting in an estimated 60 deaths in March 1995 alone), and the GIA reiterated its death threats against FIS and AIS leaders, claiming to be the &quot;sole prosecutor of jihad&quot; and angered by their negotiation attempts. On July 11 Abdelbaki Sahraoui, a co-founder of FIS, was assassinated in Paris; the GIA said that they were responsible, although there was no evidence supporting this. On November 22, 1995, the FIS asked to meet with President Zeroual in order to disband the cycle of violence that was occurring in Algeria

=== Declaration of ceasefire ===
The AIS, faced with attacks from both sides and wanting to dissociate itself from the GIA&#x27;s civilian massacres, declared a unilateral ceasefire on 21 September 1997 (in order to &quot;unveil the enemy who hides behind these abominable massacres&quot;), and disbanded in 1999. Thousands of AIS fighters surrendered and handed over their weapons to the authorities. In January 2000 those fighters obtained amnesty under the terms of the &quot;Civil Concord&quot; decreed by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after his election in April 1999. Both Mezrag and Benaïcha offered their services to the authorities to fight the GIA and the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which has links to Al-Qaeda.

On 2 July 2003, Belhadj and Madani were released (the former had been in jail, the latter had been moved to house arrest in 1997). Foreign media were banned from covering the event locally, and FIS itself remains banned. However, their release has had little apparent impact. After a decade of vicious civil conflict, there was little enthusiasm in Algeria for reopening old wounds.

As the civil war jihad impoverished the pious middle class, the AIS lost support to the &quot;moderate&quot; Islamic parties, especially the Hamas party of Mahfoud Nahnah.

<doc id="403400" wikidata="Q421831" url="?curid=403400" title="Stibnite">
<text>Stibnite, sometimes called antimonite, is a sulfide mineral with the formula Sb2S3. This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony. The name is derived from the Greek through the Latin as the former name for the mineral and the element antimony.

==Structure==
Stibnite has a structure similar to that of arsenic trisulfide, As2S3. The Sb(III) centers, which are pyramidal and three-coordinate, are linked via bent two-coordinate sulfide ions. However, some studies suggest that the actual coordination polyhedra of antimony are SbS7, with (3+4) coordination at the M1 site and (5+2) at the M2 site. Some of the secondary bonds impart cohesion and are connected with packing. Stibnite is grey when fresh, but can turn superficially black due to oxidation in air.

== Properties ==
The melting point of Sb2S3 is . The band gap is 1.88 eV at room temperature and it is a photoconductor. Stibnite is also toxic upon ingestion, with symptoms similar to those of arsenic poisoning.

==Uses==

Pastes of Sb2S3 powder in fat or in other materials have been used since c. 3000 BC as eye cosmetics in the Mediterranean and farther afield; in this use, Sb2S3 is called kohl. It was used to darken the brows and lashes, or to draw a line around the perimeter of the eye.

Antimony trisulfide finds use in pyrotechnic compositions, namely in the glitter and fountain mixtures. Needle-like crystals, &quot;Chinese needles&quot;, are used in glitter compositions and white pyrotechnic stars. The &quot;dark pyro&quot; version is used in flash powders to increase their sensitivity and sharpen their report. It is also a component of modern safety matches. It was formerly used in flash compositions, but its use was abandoned due to toxicity and sensitivity to static electricity.

Stibnite was used ever since protodynastic ancient Egypt as a medication and a cosmetic. The &quot;Sunan Abi Dawood&quot; reports, “prophet Muhammad said: &#x27;Among the best types of collyrium is antimony (&quot;ithmid&quot;) for it clears the vision and makes the hair sprout.

The 17th century alchemist Eirenaeus Philalethes, also known as George Starkey, describes stibnite in his alchemical commentary &quot;An Exposition upon Sir George Ripley&#x27;s Epistle&quot;. Starkey used stibnite as a precursor to philosophical mercury, which was itself a hypothetical precursor to the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

==Occurrence==
Stibnite occurs in hydrothermal deposits and is associated with realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, galena, pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, cervantite, stibiconite, calcite, ankerite, barite and chalcedony.

Small deposits of stibnite are common, but large deposits are rare. The world&#x27;s largest deposit of antimony, the Xikuangshan mine, yields high quality crystals in paragenesis with calcite. It occurs in Canada, Mexico, Peru, Japan, Germany, Romania, Italy, France, England, Algeria, and Kalimantan, Borneo. In the United States it is found in Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Alaska. 

Historically, the Romans used stibnite mined in Dacia to make colourless glass, the making of which ended when this province was lost to the Roman Empire. 

As of May 2007, the largest specimen on public display (1000 pounds) is at the American Museum of Natural History. The largest documented single crystals of stibnite measured ~60×5×5 cm and originated from different locations including Japan, France and Germany.

<text>The Greens – The Green Alternative (, ) is a green political party in Austria. The Greens are in a coalition with the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) in the Nehammer government. Before they were part of the Schallenberg government and the Second Kurz government. It won 8.2% of votes cast in the 2024 Austrian legislative election. The current President of Austria, Alexander Van der Bellen, is from the Green Party.

The party was founded in 1986 under the name &quot;Green Alternative&quot; (&quot;Grüne Alternative&quot;), following the merger of the more conservative Green party &quot;Vereinte Grüne Österreichs&quot; (United Greens of Austria VGÖ, founded 1982) and the more progressive party &quot;Alternative Liste Österreichs&quot; (Alternative List Austria, ALÖ, founded 1982). Since 1993, the party has carried the official name &quot;Die Grünen – Die Grüne Alternative (Grüne)&quot;, but refers to itself in English as &quot;Austrian Greens&quot;. There are still differences between the former members of the old Alternative and VGÖ factions within the party, reflected in the differing approaches of the national and state parties.

Apart from ecological issues such as environmental protection, the Greens are Pro-European and campaign for the rights of minorities and advocate a socio-ecological (&quot;ökosozial&quot;) tax reform. Their basic values according to their charter in 2001 are: &quot;direct democracy, nonviolence, ecology, solidarity, feminism and self-determination&quot;. The party is a member of the European Green Party and Global Greens.

==History==
In 1978 the Austrian Green movement began with the successful campaign to prevent the opening of the nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf (which had been favoured by Bruno Kreisky&#x27;s government), the Green Party was born in 1984 during the sit-in protests which prevented the Danube power plant at Hainburg from being built.

===Federal level===
In the 1986 parliamentary elections the Green Party started off with 4.82% of all votes cast and entered parliament with eight National Council mandates. In the early elections to National Council in 2002, the Green Party nationwide received 9.47% of votes, and won 17 mandates to the National Council. At that time, it was the highest number of votes garnered by any European Green party.

When the Greens took their seats in parliament for the first time, they chose to appear somewhat unconventional. They initially refused to adapt their behaviour to that of the other parties; an example of this is their refusal to elect a chairperson (&quot;Klubobmann/Klubobfrau&quot;) and designated a puppet made out of straw instead. Delegates would appear in parliament dressed in casual wear such as jeans and trainers. Worldwide attention was drawn when the Green delegate Andreas Wabl hoisted a swastika flag on the speakers podium in the Austrian parliament, protesting against then Federal President Kurt Waldheim.

After the national election in 2002, the Greens entered into preliminary negotiations about a possible coalition government with the conservative ÖVP. During negotiations, party leadership was accused of internally black-mailing skeptical members. Negotiations between the two parties were subsequently called off, after the results with the ÖVP were not sufficient. The Green youth organisation &quot;Grünalternative Jugend&quot; (Green Alternative Youth or GAJ) briefly occupied the rooms of the Green parliamentary club in the Austrian parliament building in protest.

In 2003 three Green federal counsellors formed their own club in the Upper House Federal Council (&quot;Bundesrat&quot;) of Parliament.

After the 2006 elections the Greens gained four seats and ended up with 21 seats and became the third largest party in Parliament, however did not have enough mandates to form a coalition government with either the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) or Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and became the largest opposition party, while the SPÖ and ÖVP formed a grand coalition government.

The party suffered from internal struggles in 2017, losing its Youth wing (which split away and formed an ephemeral joint list with the Communist Party of Austria) and later experiencing a split of Peter Pilz&#x27;s faction, forming the Peter Pilz List.

The 2017 legislative election saw a collapse for the party, scoring only 3.8% and losing its representation in the Nationalrat for the first time since 1986. Following the results, party spokesman Ingrid Felipe resigned from her post and was replaced by Werner Kogler.

The party saw a revival in the 2019 European election, in which they scored 14.1% and elected 2 MEPs. The election saw the collapse of JETZ.

The party eventually later this year, experienced a strong recovery and performed better well leading up to the 2019 snap legislative election, the Greens returned to the National Council () with their best ever result in a legislative election, scoring 13.9% and electing 26 MPs, an upswing of 10.2% from 2017.

In the 2024 Austrian legislative election, the party lost 10 seats and fell to 8.2%. The party was not included in the initial coalition negotiations between the ÖVP, SPÖ and NEOS.

=== Chairpersons since 1986 ===
The chart below shows a timeline of the Green chairpersons and the Chancellors of Austria. The left green bar shows all the chairpersons (&quot;Bundessprecher&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Chair.&quot;) of the Green party, and the right bar shows the corresponding make-up of the Austrian government at that time. The red (SPÖ), black (ÖVP), and light grey (Independent) colours correspond to which party led the federal government (&quot;Bundesregierung&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Govern.&quot;). The last names of the respective chancellors are shown, the Roman numeral stands for the cabinets.

===Federal state level===
The Green party also entered the parliaments or assemblies (&quot;Landtag&quot;) of Austrian federal states and communal governments. Following is an analysis of the party on the federal state (&quot;Länder&quot;) level:

==== Burgenland ====
The Burgenland Greens were able to take their seats in the federal state parliament (Landtag) for the first time in 2000. The party received 5.49% of the tally, which meant two mandates. In the federal state elections in 2005 these two seats were reaffirmed with 5.21% received of all votes cast.

==== Carinthia ====
In the southernmost federal state Carinthia, different Green parties ran state elections: the &quot;KEL/AL&quot; in 1984, &quot;Anderes Kärnten&quot; in 1989 and 1994, and &quot;Demokratie 99&quot; in 1999. These parties were, however, never able to enter the federal state assembly, since the Carinthian voting system requires a party to win a direct mandate in one of the four regional election districts, which effectively means a 10%-threshold in order to enter. 
Only in 2004 were the Carinthian Greens finally able to take their seats in the federal state assembly, where they are represented by cabaret artist Rolf Holub and Barbara Lesjak. On a regional level, for example in the federal state capital Klagenfurt, the Carinthian Greens have already played a political role for a longer time. In the Klagenfurt city council, the Greens are represented by Andrea Wulz, Matthias Koechl, Angelika Hoedl and Reinhold Gasper. Since the local election in 2003, the Klagenfurt Greens were able to take one of nine seats in the proportional city-government, Andrea Wulz is the town councillor for issues relating to women, family matters and social housing projects.

==== Lower Austria ====
In 1998 the Lower Austrian Greens were represented with two delegates in the federal state assembly. In the federal state elections in 2003 the Greens received 7.22% and thus won four mandates, which enabled them to form a parliamentary group - called &quot;club&quot; in Austrian politics - in the assembly. With Madeleine Petrovic, the Lower Austrian Greens have a former federal spokeswoman and one of the most outspoken animal activists of Austria as their leader (&quot;Klubobfrau&quot;). In 2005 the Lower Austrian Greens managed to win and take their seats in 100 municipal assemblies and as of 2005 had four vice-mayors. Their managing director in Lower Austria is Thomas Huber.

==== Salzburg ====
After the federal state elections in 1989 the Salzburg State Greens had two mandates in the Salzburg federal state assembly, in 1994 three and in 1999 again two. Under the leadership of Cyriak Schwaighofer the Greens performed under their expectations in the 2004 federal state elections and could not achieve the desired club status of at least three mandates. As voter-current analyses showed, the small increases in votes were largely due to former voters of the Liberal Forum (LiF), which did not run in the Salzburg elections. In March 2009 they were down from 8% to 7.3%, keeping their two seats in Salzburg State&#x27;s parliament.

The Bürgerliste (Citizen List) is the common platform of the Greens in Salzburg municipality. Like many other autonomous municipal groups it carries its own name.

==== Styria ====
The Styrian Greens have three delegates sitting in the federal state assembly, federal state spokesperson Lambert Schönleitner, Sandra Krautwaschl, and Lara Köck. There are two independent Greens parties: on the one hand the federal state party, on the other hand there is the &quot;Die Grünen - Alternative Liste Graz&quot; party for the federal state capital Graz. In the Graz city-council the Greens are represented by Sigi Binder, Lisa Rücker, Hermann Candussi and Christina Jahn.

Styria has the largest Austrian Green youth organization in Austria, called &quot;Grüne Jugend Steiermark&quot; (Green Youth Styria). Beside the Green Youth Styria there also exists Austria&#x27;s first Green students&#x27; organization, the &quot;ECO Students&quot;.

==== Tyrol ====
In Tyrol the Greens (official name: &quot;Die Grünen – die Grüne Alternative Tirol&quot;) were able to win seats and placed in 1994 Eva Lichtenberger as Austria&#x27;s first Green state councillor in a local government, responsible for environmental affairs.

The 2003 Tyrolean &quot;Landtag&quot; (state assembly) elections were the best ever for the Austrian Greens, winning 15.59% of all votes cast. In the capital city of Innsbruck the Greens reached approximately 27% of the vote. The Tyrolean election result also meant that the Greens could for the first time in history nominate a member to the Upper House of Parliament. Since 2003 the Green delegate to the Federal Council (&quot;Bundesrat&quot;) of Parliament is Eva Konrad, former chairlady of the Austrian National Union of Students (&quot;Österreichische HochschülerInnenschaft&quot;) of the University of Innsbruck.

The communal elections of 2004 brought a doubling of the mandates for the Tyrolean Greens. City elections in Innsbruck in 2006 were a success for the Greens and they gained 8 of the 40 seats in the parliament of Innsbruck.

In the elections to the European parliament the Tyrolean Greens obtained 17.32%, their best result until then. Eva Lichtenberger subsequently changed her position to become a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). The results in Innsbruck were particularly good: there the Green party received 28.28%, which made it the strongest party, even before the Christian-democratic ÖVP and the social-democratic SPÖ. The Greens were able to score on a number of issues that they have been fighting for years. Besides the social topics above all the problems of transit traffic over the Alps was important.

The Tyrolean Greens have experts on traffic issues with MEP Eva Lichtenberger, the national speaker and club chairperson Georg Willi and the speaker of group of regional of Innsbruck Gerhard Fritz. The issue of transit traffic through the Tyrol is of great importance, because the state is troubled by the massive transit traffic between Germany and Italy over the Brenner Pass. Since the Tyrol sits right in between Germany and Italy, the bulk of the commercial traffic passes through there. This heavy-duty traffic has devastating effects on the fragile alpine environment and decreases the quality of life for the inhabitants. Since the entry to the European Union, Austria had to give up any quota limitations on how much international traffic coming from EU-countries is allowed to pass through its territory.

The Tyrolean Greens accused the federal government of not having pushed for a better deal with the European Union concerning transit-traffic and in effect abandoning the concerns of the citizens. They also heavily criticised the government&#x27;s failure to negotiate a follow-up of the 1994 transit-treaty signed with the EU. Apart from the Greens, various anti-transit civic movements have formed to protest against the environmental damages caused by the traffic.

Sitting in the National Council is Kurt Grünewald, a Tyrolean member of parliament, as well as the former leader of the Greens Alexander Van der Bellen, who has Tyrolean roots (he spent a part of his youth there and went to high school in Innsbruck).

The results of the Tyrolean &quot;Landtag&quot; elections:
2003 delegates: Sepp Brugger, Maria Scheiber, Uschi Schwarzl, Elisabeth Wiesmüller und Georg Willi (club chairman);
1999 delegates: Maria Scheiber, Elisabeth Wiesmüller, Georg Willi (club chairman); 
1994 delegates: Bernhard Ernst, Franz Klug, Max Schneider und Georg Willi (club chairman [&quot;Klubobmann&quot;]); 
1989 delegates: Eva Lichtenberger, Jutta Seethaler, Franz Klug.

==== Upper Austria ====
In 1997 the Upper Austrian Greens successfully entered the Upper Austrian &quot;Landtag&quot; (state assembly) for the first time. After the state elections in 2003 (state elections in Upper Austria are held every six years, not five like in the other states), the Greens were able to win even more seats. The campaign was already aimed at gaining ministerial seats in the state government. Since the conservative Christian-democratic ÖVP was the strongest party, this would have meant for the Greens to enter into a coalition government with them (the so-called &quot;Schwarz-Grün&quot; [Black-Green] coalition, named after the party-colours). This new political constellation was quite controversial amongst party members on both sides. In the Green party, the leader Rudi Anschober was able to convince party members and after some dealing became state councillor for environmental affairs. The Greens of the state capital of Linz under the leadership of city councillor Jürgen Himmelbauer were most against this black-green project.

On the national level, the Upper Austrian Greens were able to nominate and send to the parliamentary Upper House Federal Council (&quot;Bundesrat&quot;) councillor Ruperta Lichtenecker.

==== Vorarlberg ====
The Vorarlberg Greens were the first to ever win mandates in an Austrian state assembly election. Already in 1984 they were able to win 13% of the votes in the Vorarlberg state assembly elections, which for that time was an absolute sensation. The charismatic alpine farmer Kaspanaze Simma from Bregenzerwald was the leading candidate, it was mainly due to his efforts why the party was so instantly successful. Because of their strength, the Greens were allowed to form their own parliamentary fraction (&quot;Klub&quot;), which caused some logistical problems as the newly constructed &quot;Landtag&quot; building in 1981 only provided space for the traditional three parties (ÖVP, SPÖ, FPÖ), not four. Since the traditional organic farming sector is important in the western Austrian regions, the Greens were able to gain support.

In the following years the Greens were able to consolidate their position by gaining seats on the communal and municipal level. Occasionally they lost their official club status in the state assembly, when they fared poorly from 1999 to 2004. In 2006 the speaker of the Vorarlberg Greens was Johannes Rauch.

The results of the Vorarlberg &quot;Landtag&quot; elections:
1 Combined result of ALÖ and VGÖ

==== Vienna ====
The Viennese Greens started nominating candidates in the Vienna &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; (municipal council or state assembly) in 1983 and were able to enter in 1991. Over the years they have been able to continually gather support. A lot of support has been coming from former Liberal Forum voters, after the liberals failed to enter any legislature. The traditional strongholds in Vienna for the Greens are the districts of Neubau (2005: 43.26%), Josefstadt (32.26%), Alsergrund (29.43%), Mariahilf (28.97%) and Wieden (25.14%).

In the 2001 &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; elections, the Greens were able to win the majority of a district for the first time. In the district of Neubau they won 32.55% and were able to nominate the &quot;Bezirksvorsteher&quot; (mayor of the district). The results of 2001 also allowed the Viennese Greens to nominate Stefan Schennach as federal councilor to the Upper House of Parliament (&quot;Bundesrat&quot;). But despite the strong gains, the Greens were not able to enter into a coalition government with the SPÖ, since the social-democrats were able to win an absolute majority.

The 2004 European Parliament election were the best for the Viennese Greens so far. From the total tally, they received 22%, which put them ahead of the Christian-democratic ÖVP and placed them on second position behind the SPÖ (37.7%). In Neubau the Greens received 41%. They were also able to win first place in the districts of Wieden, Mariahilf, Josefstadt and Alsergrund.

In the 2005 &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; elections, the Greens were able to win votes, but missed their target of becoming the second most powerful party and ended up on fourth place, right behind the right-wing Freedom Party (FPÖ). Because of the different weighing by districts, the Greens received 14 mandates, one more than the FPÖ. They were also able to place another city-councillor. In the districts, the party was able to consolidate their holding on Neubau, as well as win the majority of votes in Josefstadt. With that, the Greens were able to nominate a second Green district-mayor. The second place was won in the districts of Leopoldstadt, Margareten, Mariahilf, Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus and Alsergrund.

The Green delegates to the Viennese &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; or &quot;Landtag&quot; as of 2006 were: Maria Vassilakou (club-chairlady [&quot;Klubobfrau&quot;]), Waltraut Antonov, Heidi Cammerlander, Christoph Chorherr, Sabine Gretner, Susanne Jerusalem, Alev Korun, Rüdiger Maresch, Martin Margulies, Sigrid Pilz, Ingrid Puller, Marie Ringler, Marco Schreuder, Claudia Sommer-Smolik. The two city-councillors are David Ellensohn and Monika Vana.

The 2010 results meant that the SPÖ was unable to hold the majority of seats in the Vienna city council and therefore had to rule together with the Greens performing for the first time as coalition partner. The current vice-governor/vice-mayor of Vienna as of 26 June 2019 is Birgit Hebein.

The results of the Viennese &quot;Gemeinderat&quot; elections:

1 ran as Alternative Liste Wien (ALW)

==Organisation==
In 2004 the Greens had about 3,000 members nationwide, although at present there are no uniform regulations for membership. Apart from the members, the Greens rely on a large number of volunteers. The party used to function on the principles of grassroots democracy (&quot;Basisdemokratie&quot;) and rotation principle (&quot;Rotationsprinzip&quot;), but this was stopped in the course of the time. The last basic-democratic element is the &quot;Urabstimmung&quot;, which is a vote on any issue that can be initiated with the petition of at least 100 members. As of 2003 however, no such vote has taken place.

The highest body is the &quot;Federal Congress&quot; (Bundeskongress), which convenes at least once a year. All federal state organisations send delegates, also the immigrants-organisation is allowed to send delegates as &quot;the tenth Austrian state&quot;. The Federal Congress decides the electoral lists for the National Council elections and elections to the European parliament. The congress also elects the federal spokesperson (&quot;BundesprecherIn&quot;). The congress also decides the party program and sets the party guidelines.

In the last few years, the &quot;federal executive&quot; (Bundesvorstand) has developed into the actual decision-making centre. It meets at least once a week, mostly on Tuesdays, and determines the guidelines of daily politics. The federal executive also decides on party finances.
The &quot;extended federal executive&quot; (Erweiterter Bundesvorstand) consists of a smaller number of delegates from each state and meets at least once a month. It takes care of the implementation of the party-guidelines, which were set by the party congress. It also chooses the representatives of the party spokesperson.

The highest office in the party is that of the &quot;federal spokesperson&quot; (Bundessprecher). The party&#x27;s federal spokesman is Werner Kogler.

The federal state organisations (&quot;Landesorganisationen&quot;) are organised similarly: There are federal state meetings, which sometimes convene as a members meeting or a delegates meeting. Similar to the federal executive, there are federal state executives (&quot;Landesvorstände&quot;). The party charter also allows for each federal state group to hold a vote on basic issues as well that affect the whole party.

Independently in the National Council there also exists a Green National Council Club (faction), which can independently specify its guidelines. In recent years however an increasing fusion of the work between party and its club was noticeable. Michaela Sburny, successor of Franz Raft since June 2004 as the Greens&#x27; federal chairperson, was allowed to keep her National Council mandate. This means she is allowed to hold two offices at the same time, something that was frowned upon by the Greens previously.

There are different Green or Greenish organisations within the party and associated with it. These include:
* The &quot;Grünen Andersrum&quot; is the gay-, lesbian and transgender organisation, which is organised differently from state to state, and exists in all states except Vorarlberg and Burgenland. In Vienna, the &quot;Grünen Andersrum&quot; are a part of the party itself.
* The &quot;Grünen SeniorInnen&quot; (DGS) is the organisation for senior citizens. It was founded on March 9, 2001, in Vienna. The DGS fights for a policy more friendly to senior citizens and their right to lead an active, fulfilling and self-determined life.
* The &quot;Initiative Grüne MigrantInnen&quot; (IGM) is the Green group for immigrants in Austria. Their demands are a facilitation of integration into life in Austria, equal rights and equal opportunities, fight against racism and other issues concerning migrants.
* The &quot;Grüne und Alternative Studierende&quot; (GRAS) is a separate party which candidates in the elections for the Austrian National Union of Students (&quot;Österreichische HochschülerInnenschaft&quot; – ÖH). There they are the biggest faction, together with the Socialist Students of Austria (&quot;Verband Sozialistischer StudentInnen Österreichs&quot; – VSStÖ) they form the executive committee of the Austrian National Union for Students.
* The &quot;Grünalternative Jugend&quot; (GAJ) is the youth organisation of the Green party. The GAJ existed since the 1990s. It is a member of the Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG). The GAJ sees itself rather as extreme left. The organisation is subdivided into smaller groups for each state.
* The &quot;Grüne Frauenorganisation&quot; is the organisation for women. As of 2005, it does not exist yet in every state.
* &quot;ECO Students&quot; is a Green student&#x27;s organisation, which currently only exists in Styria.
* The &quot;Grüne Wirtschaft&quot; is the Green economic organisation and runs in the elections for the Economic Parliament of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (&quot;Wirtschaftskammer Österreich&quot; – WKÖ).
* The &quot;Alternative und Unabhängige GewerkschafterInnen&quot; (AUGE/UG) is the Green labour union. It runs in the elections for the labour parliament of the Austrian Labour Chamber (&quot;Arbeiterkammer&quot; – AK).

The education and training of new Green politicians is done by the &quot;Grüne Bildungswerkstatt&quot;, which is an independent voluntary association. The &quot;Grüne Bildungswerkstatt&quot; is financed by the republic, as regulated by Austrian law for the equal treatment of all parliamentary parties.

==Electoral results==

<text>The National Liberation Front (; ), commonly known by its French acronym FLN, is a nationalist political party in Algeria. It was the principal nationalist movement during the Algerian War and the sole legal and ruling political party of the Algerian state until other parties were legalised in 1989.

The FLN was established in 1954 following a split in the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties from members of the Special Organisation paramilitary; its armed wing, the National Liberation Army, participated in the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. After the Évian Accords of 1962, the party purged internal dissent and ruled Algeria as a one-party state. After the 1988 October Riots and the Algerian Civil War (1991–2002) against Islamist groups, the FLN was reelected to power in the 2002 Algerian legislative election, and has generally remained in power until 2007, when it started forming coalitions with other parties.

== History ==

=== Colonial era ===

The background of the FLN can be traced back to the growing anti-colonialism and Algerian nationalist sentiments since the outbreak of WWII. The repression against the Algerian Muslim population intensified as Abdelhamid Ben Badis got placed under house arrest and Marshal Pétain&#x27;s government banned the Algerian Communist Party and Algerian People&#x27;s Party. As the war turned gradually more in favor of the Western Allies, given the US&#x27;s global engagement and its ideological campaign against colonialism, the core sentiment amongst the Algerian nationalists was to use the victory in Europe to promote the independence of the country, which is reflected by the issuing of the Manifesto of the Algerian People by Ferhat Abbas. As this objective failed to materialize, a new party Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTDL) founded by the just-released Messali Hadj started to gain momentum and took the lead in the nationalist movement.

However, the Algerian Assembly&#x27;s double electoral college system stipulated an equal number of 60 representation between the French settlers and the Muslim community while the Muslim community was significantly larger than the settlers. The underrepresentation combined with the unfair election in 1948 limited the MTDL&#x27;s ability to gain further political power. Consequently, the Algerian nationalists veered to a more military approach as noted in their participation in the Special Organisation (Algeria), which is a paramilitary component of the MTLD and included the important figures in Algerian politics such Ahmed Ben Bella, Hocine Aït Ahmed, and Mohammed Boudiaf.

Later in 1951, the capture of Ahmed Ben Bella and the subsequent dismantling of the Special Organisation temporarily subdued the nationalist movement but sparked a desire in the Special Organisation militants to form a new organization – the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action (CRUA). It initially had a five-man leadership consisting of Mostefa Ben Boulaïd, Larbi Ben M&#x27;hidi, Rabah Bitat, Mohamed Boudiaf and Mourad Didouche. They were joined by Krim Belkacem in August, and Hocine Aït Ahmed, Ahmed Ben Bella and Mohamed Khider later in the summer.

The FLN was established on 10 October 1954. It succeeded the CRUA which had been formed earlier in the year because the CRUA failed to provide unity within the MTLD Party. On 1 November 1954, the FLN launched the Algerian War after publishing the Declaration of 1 November 1954 written by journalist Mohamed Aïchaoui. Didouche was killed on 18 January 1955, whilst both Ben Boulaïd and Bitat were captured by the French. Abane Ramdane was recruited to take control of the FLN&#x27;s Algiers campaign, and went on to become one of its most effective leaders. By 1956, nearly all the nationalist organizations in Algeria had joined the FLN, which had established itself as the main nationalist group through both co-opting and coercing smaller organizations; the most important group that remained outside the FLN was Messali Hadj&#x27;s Algerian National Movement (MNA). At this time the FLN reorganized into something like a provisional government, consisting of a five-man executive and legislative body, and was organized territorially into six wilayas, following the Ottoman-era administrative boundaries.

The FLN&#x27;s armed wing during the war was called the National Liberation Army (ALN). It was divided into guerrilla units fighting France and the MNA in Algeria (and wrestling with Messali&#x27;s followers over control of the expatriate community, in the &quot;Café Wars&quot; in France), and another, stronger component more resembling a traditional army. These units were based in neighbouring Arab countries (notably in Oujda in Morocco, and Tunisia), and although they infiltrated forces and ran weapons and supplies across the border, they generally saw less action than the rural guerrilla forces. These units were later to emerge under the leadership of army commander Colonel Houari Boumediene as a powerful opposition to the political cadres of the FLN&#x27;s exile government, the GPRA, and they eventually came to dominate Algerian politics.

====FLN violence====
The Algerian war resulted in between 300,000 and 400,000 deaths. The FLN is considered responsible for over 16,000 civilians killed and over 13,000 disappeared between 1954 and 1962. After the ceasefire of 19 March 1962, the FLN is thought to have massacred thousands of harkis, Muslim Algerians who had served in the French army and whom the French, contrary to promises given, had denied a &quot;repatriation&quot; to France. An example of an FLN massacre is the Philippeville massacre.

=== Independence and one-party state ===
The war for independence continued until March 1962, when the French government finally signed the Évian Accords, a ceasefire agreement with the FLN. In July of the same year, the Algerian people approved the cease-fire agreement with France in a referendum, supporting economic and social cooperation between the two countries as well. Full independence followed, and the FLN seized control of the country. Political opposition in the form of the MNA and Communist organizations was outlawed, and Algeria was constituted as a one-party state. The FLN became its only legal and ruling party.

Immediately after independence, the party experienced a severe internal power struggle. Political leaders coalesced into two large camps: a Political Bureau formed by the radical Ahmed Ben Bella, who was assisted by the border army, faced off against the political leadership in the former exile government; Boumédiène&#x27;s army quickly put down resistance and installed Ben Bella as president. The single most powerful political constituency remained the former ALN, which had returned largely unscathed from exile and was now organized as the country&#x27;s armed forces; added to this were regionally powerful guerrilla irregulars and others who jockeyed for influence in the party. In building his one-party regime, Ben Bella purged remaining dissidents (such as Ferhat Abbas), but also quickly ran into opposition from Boumédiène as he tried to assert himself independently from the army.

In 1965, the tension between Boumédiène and Ben Bella culminated in a coup d&#x27;état, after Ben Bella had tried to sack one of the Colonel&#x27;s closest collaborators, Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika (who was elected President of Algeria in 1999). A statist-socialist and anticolonial nationalist, Boumédiène ruled through decree and &quot;revolutionary legitimacy&quot;, marginalizing the FLN in favor of his personal decision-making and the military establishment, even while retaining the one-party system. Boumédiène held tight control over party leadership until his death in 1978, at which time the party reorganized again under the leadership of the military&#x27;s next candidate, Col. Chadli Bendjedid. The military remained well-represented on the FLN Central Committee and is widely thought to have been the real power-broker in the country. During the 1980s the FLN toned down the socialist content of its programme, enacting some free-market reforms and purging Boumédiène stalwarts.

=== Multi-party era ===

It was not until 1988 that massive demonstrations and riots jolted the country towards major political reform. The riots led to the constitution being amended to allow a multi-party system. The first multi-party elections were the 1990 local elections, which saw the FLN heavily defeated by the Islamist Islamic Salvation Front (ISF), which won control of over half the local councils; the FLN received just over a quarter of the vote, retaining control of a similar number of councils. The first round of the parliamentary elections the following year saw the ISF win 188 of the 231 seats, whilst the FLN won only 16, placing third behind the Socialist Forces Front. However, shortly afterwards, due to fears of the ISF forming an Islamic state, a military coup d&#x27;état cancelled the election process and forced president Bendjedid to resign, sparking the Algerian Civil War.

Algeria was under direct military rule for several years, during which the party remained in opposition to the government during the first part of the war, notably in 1995 signing the Sant&#x27;Egidio Platform, which was highly critical of the military establishment. After internal power struggles and a leadership change, it returned to supporting the presidency. After formal democracy was restored, the FLN initially failed to regain its prominent position; in the 1997 parliamentary elections it emerged as the third-largest party, receiving 14% of the vote and winning 69 of the 231 seats. However, it won a landslide victory in the 2002 elections, winning 199 of the 389 seats.

The party nominated Ali Benflis as its candidate for the 2004 presidential elections. He finished as runner-up to the incumbent Abdelaziz Bouteflika, but received only 6.4% of the vote. In 2005 FLN formed the Presidential Alliance with the National Rally for Democracy (RND) and the Movement of Society for Peace (MSP).

The 2007 parliamentary elections saw the FLN reduced to 163 seats, although the FLN&#x27;s Abdelaziz Belkhadem remained Prime Minister. Bouteflika was the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2009 presidential elections, which he won with 90% of the vote.

In 2012, MSP left the Presidential Alliance and joined the Green Algeria Alliance. Despite that, the FLN remained the largest party following the 2012 parliamentary elections, winning 208 of the 462 seats. Bouteflika was re-elected on the FLN ticket in the 2014 presidential elections with 82% of the vote. The elderly and ailing Bouteflika is widely seen as a mere frontman for what has often described as a &quot;shadowy&quot; group of generals and intelligence officers known to the Algerians collectively as &quot;le pouvoir&quot; (&quot;the power&quot;) and whose individual members are called &quot;décideurs&quot; with &quot;The Economist&quot; writing in 2012 &quot;The most powerful man in the land may be Mohamed Mediène, known as Toufiq who has headed military intelligence for two decades&quot;. General Mohamed Mediène, the chief of military intelligence from 1990 to 2015 was known to be a leading &quot;décideur&quot; within &quot;le pouvior&quot; and for his secrecy with &quot;The Economist&quot; reporting on 21 September 2013: &quot;Despite his leading role in defeating Islamic militants in a brutal civil war between 1991 and 2000, and his less public role as kingmaker in the &quot;pouvoir&quot;, General Mediene&#x27;s face remains unknown; it is said that anyone who has seen it expires soon after.&quot; On 13 September 2015, it was announced that Mediène was retiring and President Bouteflika had appointed General Athmane Tartag to succeed him. Mediène&#x27;s dismissal was viewed as the culmination of a long &quot;behind-the-scenes power struggle&quot; with Bouteflika, leaving the latter fully in charge and giving him more power to determine his own successor.

In the 2017 parliamentary elections, FLN won 164 of the 462 seats, thus losing 44 seats; however, thanks to the good performance of the RND (which won 100 seats), the Presidential Alliance was able to maintain a parliamentary majority and continue to rule the country.

==== Relationship with Jewish Algerians ====
Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship during the colonial era starting in 1870, while Muslims were denied citizenship by the French. The Jews in Algeria were seen as a go-between for French-Muslim relations; however, the lack of citizenship on behalf of the Muslims created tension between the two groups. During the Algerian War, Jews felt as if they were being forced to choose sides; they were either Algerian and fighting with the FLN for independence, or they were French and fighting with the French to keep Algeria as a colony. At the start of the Algerian War, the FLN offered Jews the opportunity to join their efforts, and in return Jews would be given Algerian citizenship when Algeria won independence. Most of the Jews in Algeria sided with the French Government, much to the dismay of the FLN and their supporters. During the course of the war, Jews in Algeria began to feel as if the FLN was targeting Jews and not just the French people living in Algeria. This led to increased tensions between Jews and Muslims in the area. After the war, Algerian citizenship was only extended to Muslims whose fathers and grandfathers were Muslim at the time the FLN won independence from the French Government and those who participated directly or indirectly in the national liberation movement. Algerian Jews were no longer considered Algerian, but they still retained French citizenship. With their French citizenship, the majority of Jews in Algeria decided to emigrate to France, with a small number of Jews deciding to emigrate to Israel and an even smaller number of Jews deciding to stay in Algeria under the rule of the FLN. Between 1961 and 1962, 130,000 out of Algeria&#x27;s 140,000 Jews left for France, while around 10,000 immigrated to Israel.

== Ideology ==
The FLN&#x27;s ideology was primarily Algerian nationalist, understood as a movement within a wider Arab nationalism and also a pan-Arab solidarity. It essentially drew its political self-legitimization from three sources: &quot;Nationalism&quot;, and the revolutionary war against France; &quot;Socialism&quot;, loosely interpreted as a popular anti-exploitation creed; &quot;Islam&quot;, defined as the main foundation for the national consciousness, and a crucial factor in solidifying the Algerian identity as separate from that of French Algerians or pied-noirs.

As the name implies, it viewed itself as a &quot;front&quot; composed of different social sectors and ideological trends, even if the concept of a monolithic Algerian polity gradually submerged this vision. A separate party ideology was not well developed at the time of independence, except insofar as it focused on the liberation of Algeria. This latter aspect led to the denial of or refusal to deal with the separate Berber identity held by Algerian Berbers who made up about 20% of Algeria, something which caused fierce opposition and led to the splintering of the movement immediately after independence, as Hocine Aït Ahmed set up the Berberist and pro-democracy Socialist Forces Front (FFS) in Tizi Ouzou and began a rebellion in Kabylia which was defeated by the government in 1965.

=== Anti-colonialism and Islamism ===

Anti-Colonialism is widely considered as the core value in Algerian official discourse during its entire contemporary political and social history, especially during the formation of the FLN and later during the Islamist movement. The Muslim population had been discriminated against at a constitutional level, as illustrated by the fact that French settlers formed up to 80% of the membership in three departmental councils in 1875; and at a local level, the metropolitan model composed of a major and municipal council only granted voting right to 5% of the adult male Muslim population until 1919, when the number increased to 25%. Therefore, its nationalist outlook was also closely interwoven with anti-Colonialism and anti-imperialism, something which would remain a lasting characteristic of Algerian foreign policy.

Islamism pertained its dominance in Algerian politics because of the specific social contexts during different periods. The humiliating failure of the Mokrani Revolt in 1871 facilitated the pro-Islamism sentiment in the society as people generally regarded Islam as the long-lasting and never-fading symbolic opposition towards the French rule; also the Italian invasion of Libya in 1911 provoked sympathy in the Muslim community and strengthened the Islamic cultural identity and these two events together consolidated the Islamism-Colonialism opposition rhetoric.

The politicization of the Islamism started with the noticeable wave of Islamic discourse led by religious scholars such as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838–97), Mohammed Abduh (1849–1905) and Rashid Rida (1865–1935) that focused on resisting the foreign economic control and establishing an Islamic country based on the sharia, which were the core values of the Algerian Ulama. The movement absolutely rejected atheism and was not overtly secularist, contrary to widespread perception in the West, and Islamism was perhaps the most important mobilizing ideology during the Algerian War. Still, after independence, the party would in practice assume a strongly modernist interpretation of Islam, supported the social transformation of Algerian society, the emancipation of women, etc., and worked only through secular institutions.

Before Col. Chadli Bendjedid came into power in 1971, the Islamic movement had been rather successfully monitored and subdued by the government during the previous 20 years, but the Iranian Revolution rekindled the movement and posed a greater threat to the state. Since the Algerian independence, Religion had been relegated to the role of legitimizing factor for the party-regime, especially under the presidency of Col. Houari Boumédiènne (1965–78), but even then Islam was considered the state religion and a crucial part of Algerian identity, as Boumédiènne himself took pride in his Quranic training. His predecessor Ahmed Ben Bella (1962–65) was more committed to the Islamic component of the regime, although always viewed as more of an Arab nationalist than an Islamic activist (and he remains far removed from what is today referred to as Algeria&#x27;s Islamists). During the mid- to late-1980s, Bendjedid reintroduced religiously conservative legislation in an attempt to appease growing Islamist opposition. During and after the Algerian Civil War, the party&#x27;s position has remained that of claiming Algerian Islam as a main influence, while simultaneously arguing that this must be expressed as a progressive and modern faith, even if the party generally keeps in line with the conservative social mores of Algeria&#x27;s population. It has strongly condemned the radical-fundamentalist religious teachings of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and other Islamist groups, even while supporting the inclusion of non-violent Islamist parties in the political system and working with them.

=== Arab nationalism and Pan-Arabism ===
Arab nationalism and Pan-Arabism are considered core principles of the FLN and Algerian nationalism. Arab themes were glorified as the foundation of Algerian nationalism that would fit into Pan-Arabism. Albert Camus argued that Algerian nationalism was closely tied to Nasserism and Pan-Arabism in an essay titled &#x27;Algeria 1958&#x27;. A prominent member of the Algerian independence movement, Abdel-Hamid ibn Badis (1889–1940), emphasized the Arab and Muslim character of Algeria through his Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, and famously coined the often-cited phrase: &quot;Islam is our religion, Algeria is our homeland, Arabic is our language&quot;, while his fellow &#x27;alim Ahmad Tawfiq al-Madani (1889–1983) wrote extensive historical writings in Arabic celebrating the Muslim and Arab ancestors of Algeria.

During the Algerian war of independence, the FLN emerged as the main socialist group after uniting with several smaller independence groups, and was strongly committed to Pan-Arabism. A major supporter of the Algerian independence movement was Gamal Abdel Nasser, whose mixture of Arab nationalism and revolution appealed to the Arabs in North Africa. He provided financial, diplomatic and military support to the FLN, and based the Algerian provisional government in Cairo. This played a major role in France&#x27;s decision to wage war against him during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Once Algeria gained independence in 1962, Arab nationalist leader Ahmed Ben Bella was elected president after winning elections with 99.6 per cent of the votes. He composed the Algerian constitution in October 1963, which asserted that Islam was the state religion, Arabic was the sole national and official language of the state, Algeria was an integral part of the Arab world, and that Arabization was the first priority of the country to reverse French colonization.

Ben Bella was succeeded by Houari Boumédiène in 1965, who also pursued Arab socialist and Pan-Arabist policies. He drafted a new Algerian constitution in 1976 which declared &quot;the unity of the Arab people is written in the community of the destinies of these people. When there will be the conditions for a unity based on the liberation of the popular masses, Algeria will engage itself in the promotion of the formulas of union, integration or fusion that may fully respond to the legitimate and deep aspirations of the Arab people&quot;. Like Ben Bella, Boumédiène imposed Arab socialism as the state ideology and declared Islam the state religion. He was more assertive than Ben Bella in carrying out Arabization, especially between 1970 and 1977. The year 1971 was declared the &quot;year of Arabization&quot;. Chadli Bendjedid had talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1988 about forming an Algeria-Libya Arab union. Instead the Arab Maghreb Union was formed in 1989.

=== Socialism ===

A historical reference of socialist values is the implementation of the Warnier Law of 1873, which allowed the selling of community land at an individual base toppled the economic power of the Algerian indigenous elites; the elimination of class structure undertoned the later FLN populism and socialist agendas. Such egalitarianism, which implies a liberation struggle, reflects the FLN&#x27;s militant socialism during Ben Bella&#x27;s period, who considered the struggle was to invent a new society to release the peasantry&#x27;s potential.

This ideological construct of the FLN is controversial and disputed but can be analyzed through lenses of different socio-economic contexts. Given the global background of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War, Algeria was considered the entry point into the Third World in this ideological conflict; the FLN&#x27;s ideologies under Ben Bella and Boumédiène were largely shaped by the fundamental needs of the country such as radical economic reforms, getting international aids and recognition, along with the domestic Islamic pressure.

Facing the grave economic consequences of the Algerian War of Independence that included the destruction of 8,000 villages and millions of acres of land, a centralized authority, in this case, the FLN, was forced to act and redress the problem through a Leninist and corporatist framework. In response, Ben Bella also experimented the socialist &quot;autogestion&quot; among the Muslim workers who entered industrial and agricultural businesses that featured profit-sharing and equity. Ben Bella and his supporters in the FLN believed in the harmony between religion and socialism and it was in their political interest to renew the FLN party by leading a popular revolution to integrate Islam and socialism.

Despite being challenged by the Algerian Ulema and other domestic conservatives who criticized Ben Bella on the shallowness of his intentionally Islamism-leaning policies, the FLN kept its Marxist–Leninist organization principles that featured a secular institutional dominance over religion. The later FLN&#x27;s ideological change towards anti-socialism and anti-communism can be illustrated by Kaid Ahmed&#x27;s opposition towards Boumédiène&#x27;s leftist agenda, which featured the radical agrarian revolution that hurt rich landowners who defended themselves on the religious ground and fueled the Islamic movement, which gradually took over the national sentiment later in the century. Starting in 1971 and ending in 1992, the government under Chadli Bendjedid was authoritative but collegial, less rigid on ideologies but more moderate on domestic and international issues, while Bendjedid and his advisers believed in socialism.

=== Communism ===

The organization initially committed itself to socialism, but understood this along the lines of Arab socialism, and opposed orthodox Marxism. The existence of different classes in Algerian society was generally rejected, even if several of the party&#x27;s top ideologues were influenced to varying degrees by Marxist analysis.

Borrowed Marxist terminology was instead commonly reinterpreted by party radicals in terms of the conflict with France, e.g. casting the colonizer in the role of economic exploiter-oppressor as well as national enemy, while the label of &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; was applied to uncooperative or pro-French elites. The FLN absorbed some communist activists into its ranks during the War of Independence for pragmatic reasons but refused to allow them to organize separately from the FLN after the war. The FLN then quickly moved to dissolve the pro-Moscow Algerian Communist Party (PCA). However, since independent Algeria was set up as a one-party system under the FLN soon thereafter, many communist intellectuals were later co-opted into the regime at various stages. The cooperation occurred during the early Ben Bella and late Boumédiènne years when the Socialist Vanguard Party (PAGS), established in 1966, cooperated and tactically consulted with the FLN and recognized the FLN as the sole legitimate party in the country.

=== Contemporary developments ===

During all periods of Algerian post-colonial history, except for a few years between 1990 and 1996, the FLN has been a pillar of the political system and has primarily been viewed as a &quot;pro-system&quot; party. Its role as Algeria&#x27;s liberators has remained the absolute cornerstone of the party&#x27;s self-perception, and the defining feature of its otherwise somewhat fluid ideology. The FLN was close to former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was made honorary chairman. It mixes its traditional populist interpretations of Algeria&#x27;s nationalist-revolutionary and Islamic heritage with a pro-system conservatism, and support for gradual pro-market reform qualified by statist reflexes. Since the breakdown of the one-party system and its detachment from the state structure in ca. 1988–1990, the FLN has been in favor of multi-party democracy, whereas it upheld itself as the only organization representing the Algerian people before this period.

The FLN was admitted into Socialist International (SI) as a consultative member at the SI&#x27;s spring congress on 4–5 February 2013. It was expelled from the Socialist International during the 2019 protests in Algeria.

<text>John Glas (5 October 1695 – 2 November 1773) was a Scottish clergyman who started the Glasite church movement.

==Biography==

===Early years===
He was born at Auchtermuchty, Fife, where his father was parish minister. He was educated at Kinclaven and Perth Grammar School, graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1713, and completed his education for the ministry at Edinburgh. He was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Dunkeld, and soon afterwards ordained by that of Dundee as minister of the parish of Tealing (1719), where his preaching soon drew a large congregation. Early in his ministry he was brought to a halt while lecturing on the Shorter Catechism by the question &quot;How doth Christ execute the office of a king?&quot; This led to an examination of the New Testament foundation of the Christian Church, and in 1725, in a letter to Francis Archibald, minister of Guthrie, Forfarshire, he repudiated the obligation of national covenants.

===Separate society===
In the same year he formed a society separate from the multitude, numbering nearly a hundred, and drawn from his own and neighbouring parishes. The members of this &quot;ecclesiola in ecclesia&quot; pledged themselves to join together in the Christian profession, to follow Christ the Lord as the righteousness of his people, to walk together in brotherly love, and in the duties of it, in subjection to Glas as their overseer in the Lord, to observe the Lord&#x27;s Supper once a month and to submit themselves to the Lord&#x27;s law for removing offences. From the scriptural doctrine of the essentially spiritual nature of the kingdom of Christ, Glas in his public teaching drew the conclusions that:

* there is no warrant in the New Testament for a national church
* the magistrate as such has no function in the church
* National Covenants are without scriptural grounds
* the true Reformation cannot be carried out by political and secular weapons but by the word and spirit of Christ only.

===Treatise===
This argument is most fully exhibited in a treatise entitled &quot;The Testimony of the King of Martyrs&quot; (1729). For the promulgation of these views, which were at variance with the doctrines of the national church of Scotland, he was summoned (1726) before his presbytery, where in the course of being investigated, he affirmed his belief that every national church established by the laws of earthly kingdoms is anti-Christian in its constitution and persecuting in its spirit, and further declared opinions upon the subject of church government which amounted to a repudiation of Presbyterianism and an acceptance of the puritan type of Independence.

===Suspension from ministry===
For these opinions he was in 1728 suspended from his ministerial functions, and finally deposed in 1730. The members of the society already referred to, however, for the most part continued to adhere to him, thus constituting the first Glassite or Glasite church. The seat of this congregation was shortly afterwards transferred to Dundee (whence Glas subsequently removed to Edinburgh), where he officiated for some time as an elder. He next laboured in Perth for a few years, where he was joined by Robert Sandeman, who married his daughter Catherine — eventually Sandeman was recognized as the leader and principal exponent of Glas&#x27;s views; these he developed in a direction which laid them open to the charge of antinomianism.

===Restoration to ministry===
Ultimately in 1730 Glas returned to Dundee for the remainder of his life. He introduced in his church the primitive custom of the &quot;osculum pacis&quot; and the &quot;agape&quot; celebrated as a common meal with broth. From this custom his congregation was known as &#x27;the kail kirk&#x27;. In 1739 the General Assembly, without any appeal from him, removed the sentence of deposition against him, and restored him to the status of a minister of the gospel of Christ, but not that of a minister of the Established Church of Scotland, declaring that he was not eligible for a charge until he should have renounced principles inconsistent with the constitution of the church.

===Personal life===
In 1721 Glas married Katherine Black, the youngest daughter of Rev Thomas Black of St John&#x27;s Church in Perth. Black was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

The couple had a happy marriage and brought forth 15 children – all of whom predeceased him, as did his wife, who died of tuberculosis in 1749, 24 years before him. His son, captain George Glas R.N. was murdered along with his wife and daughter on board a treasure ship traveling from Tenerife to London in 1765. The case was notorious at the time and is believed to be the inspiration behind R.L. Stevenson’s ‘Treasure Island’. Stevenson grew up beside the Glasite church in Edinburgh and the family may have worshiped there. According to the accounts of the time, Glas was a most kind-hearted man, very fond of children, a most humane man, with not a trace of fanaticism or bigotry. One daughter Agnes Glas married Hector Turnbull who developed bleachfields in Luncarty near Perth.

John Glas died on 2 November 1773 and was buried at The Howff in Dundee on 5 November 1773. The grave lies in the south west near a north-south path. The original sandstone monument eroded and was replaced by a long-lasting red granite monument around 1880.

===Non-Denominational Christianity===
As Glas found inconsistencies with the Church of Scotland and what he found in the New Testament, he led a church movement during the first half of the 18th century which promoted the ideal that the church should be governed by the simple order in the New Testament rather than by human councils and synods. About thirty Churches of Christ were established in Great Britain through the efforts of Glas and others, including his son in law, Robert Sandeman. These churches emphasized the wearing of only New Testament names - usually &quot;Church of Christ,&quot; taught baptism is for the remission of sins, and practiced &quot;a cappella&quot; singing in worship.

==Publications==
Glas&#x27;s published works bear witness to his vigorous mind and scholarly attainments. His reconstruction of the &quot;True Discourse ef Celsus&quot; (1753), from Origen&#x27;s reply to it, is a competent and learned piece of work. &quot;The Testimony of the King of Martyrs concerning His Kingdom&quot; (1729) is a classic repudiation of erastianism and defence of the spiritual autonomy of the church under Jesus Christ. His common sense appears in his rejection of John Hutchinson&#x27;s attempt to prove that the Bible supplies a complete system of physical science, and his shrewdness in his &quot;Notes on Scripture Texts&quot; (1747). He published a volume of &quot;Christian Songs&quot; (Perth, 1784; 13th ed., 1847). A collected edition of his works was published at Edinburgh in 1761 (4 vols., 8vo), and again at Perth in 1782 (5 vols., 8vo).

==Legacy==
Though the Glasite Church is now &#x27;extinct&#x27;, certain former Glasite chapels, which tended to be of unusual form, survive, e.g. in Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. The former Dundee Glasite church is still used for religious purposes, having been acquired by the adjacent St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church in 1973 and transformed into part of a complex of halls. The archives of the Glasite Church are held by Archive Services, University of Dundee.

<text>A pamphleteer is a historical term used to describe someone who creates or distributes pamphlets, unbound (therefore inexpensive) booklets intended for wide circulation.

== Context ==
Pamphlets were used to broadcast the writer&#x27;s opinions: to articulate a political ideology, for example, or to encourage people to vote for a particular politician. Early modern news pamphlets also made extensive use of stock imagery to describe, highlight, or criticize various social and cultural events and issues. During times of political unrest, such as the French Revolution, pamphleteers were highly active in attempting to shape public opinion. Before the advent of telecommunications, those with access to a printing press and a supply of paper often used pamphlets to widely disseminate their ideas.

== Famous pamphleteers ==
Thomas Paine&#x27;s pamphlets were influential in the history of the American Revolutionary War. 17th-century Dutch naval officer Witte de With wrote papers mocking and praising his fellow officers. Poet and polemicist John Milton published pamphlets as well. Jonathan Edwards and John Calvin changed the course of Christianity with their pamphlets.

<doc id="403417" wikidata="Q2220573" url="?curid=403417" title="Glasite">
<text>The Glasites or Glassites were a small Christian church founded in about 1730 in Scotland by John Glas. Glas&#x27;s faith, as part of the First Great Awakening, was spread by his son-in-law Robert Sandeman into England and America, where the members were called Sandemanians.

Glas dissented from the Westminster Confession only in his views as to the spiritual nature of the church and the functions of the civil magistrate. But Sandeman added a distinctive doctrine as to the nature of faith which is thus stated on his tombstone:
:That the bare death of Jesus Christ without a thought or deed on the part of man, is sufficient to present the chief of sinners spotless before God.

In a series of letters to James Hervey, the author of &quot;Theron and Aspasio&quot;, Sandeman maintained that justifying faith is a simple assent to the divine testimony concerning Jesus, differing in no way in its character from belief in any ordinary testimony.

== Beliefs and practice ==

In their practice the Glasite churches aimed at a strict conformity with the primitive type of Christianity, as understood by them. Each congregation had a plurality of elders, pastors, or bishops, who were chosen according to what were believed to be the instructions of Paul, without regard to previous education or present occupation, and who enjoy a perfect equality in office. To have been married a second time disqualified one for ordination, or for continued tenure of the office of bishop.

In all the action of the church unanimity was considered to be necessary; if any member differed in opinion from the rest, he must either surrender his judgement to that of the church, or be shut out from its communion. To join in prayer with anyone not a member of the denomination was regarded as unlawful, and even to eat or drink with one who had been excommunicated was held to be wrong. The Lord&#x27;s Supper was observed weekly; and between forenoon and afternoon service every Sunday a love feast was held at which every member was required to be present. This took the form not of symbolic morsels of wine and bread, as in other communions, but a (relatively) substantial meal, a custom leading to the Glasites&#x27; nickname of &quot;Kail Kirk&quot; for the Scotch broth that was served at this setting. This custom may have arisen, in part, as a charitable response to the poverty of most members of this Church and also as a pragmatic response to the length of meetings (particularly the sermons) and the distances some members of the congregation had to travel in order to attend.

At Glasite services, any member who &quot;possesses the gift of edifying the brethren&quot;, was allowed to speak. The practice of washing one another&#x27;s feet was at one time observed; and it was for a long time customary for each brother and sister to receive new members, on admission, with a holy kiss.

&quot;Things strangled and blood&quot; were rigorously abstained from. They disapproved of all lotteries and games of chance. The accumulation of wealth they held to be unscriptural and improper.

== Churches ==

A church was set up by Glas in Dundee following his suspension by the Church of Scotland, with its congregation becoming known as Glasites. The first meeting house in Perth followed in 1733. Glasite churches were also founded in Paisley, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leith, Arbroath, Montrose, Aberdeen, Dunkeld, Cupar, and Galashiels. Buildings built as Glasite chapels survive in Dundee, Edinburgh and Perth (two), Galashiels and possibly elsewhere.

=== Sandemanian Churches in England ===
Glas&#x27;s views were again advanced beyond Scotland with Sandeman&#x27;s publication of Letters on Theron and Aspasio in 1757. The resulting correspondence between the leading church elders, Glas and Sandeman, and English pastors, Samuel Pike, John Barnard, and William Cudworth among others, led to the adoption of this primitive form of Christianity for their London congregations beginning in the early 1760s. John Barnard&#x27;s petition to Robert Sandeman brought the latter south to London from Scotland in April 1761 with his brother William and John Handasyde, an Elder from the Northumberland meeting house. This visit led to the establishment of the first legitimately constituted Sandemanian congregation on 23 March 1762 at &quot;Glover&#x27;s Hall&quot;. To accommodate larger gatherings, this congregation moved initially to the Bull and Mouth-Street, St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand, and then to Paul&#x27;s Alley in the Barbican in the autumn of 1778. This third London meeting house was that of Michael Faraday&#x27;s youth. The Sandemanians relocated to Barnsbury Grove, in north London, in 1862 where they met until nearly the turn of the century. Michael Faraday was a Deacon at Paul&#x27;s Alley in the Barbican during the 1830s, an Elder there from 1840 to 1844 and again from 1860 to 1864, the final two years of which were at the Barnsbury Grove meeting house (see 2008 photograph). A plaque was installed in the building indicating his seat of prayer. The building was converted into a telephone exchange, and that end of Barnsbury Grove renamed Faraday Close.

==== Beyond London ====

As the congregation at the Bull and Mouth-Street, St. Martins-le-Grand, London solidified through the inclusion of noted pastors like Samuel Pike in 1765, other English parishes followed their Sandemanian lead. The first response outside London occurred in Yorkshire with followers of Benjamin Ingham. Ingham discreetly sent two of his preachers, James Allen and William Batty, to Scotland to observe Glasite practices in 1761. Of these three Methodist preachers, only Allen fully converted and began to establish Sandemanian meeting houses in Northern England, to include his hometown of Gayle, Kirkby Stephen, Newby, and Kirkby Lonsdale. By 1768 Allen, together with John Barnard and William Cudworth from London, helped establish congregations in York, Norfolk, Colne, Wethersfield, Liverpool, Whitehaven, Trowbridge and Nottingham. Sandeman personally established fewer than a dozen churches in England including Liverpool before he went to America in 1764. The Trowbridge meeting house, in Wiltshire, was the location to which Samuel Pike moved and at which he preached for the final two years until his death in 1773.

===Sandemanian Churches in America===
Robert Sandeman sailed into Boston from Glasgow aboard the &quot;George and James&quot;, captained by Montgomery, on 18 October 1764. At the invitation of Ezra Stiles, Sandeman preached his first sermon in Newport on 28 November. He spent Christmas and most of January 1765 in Danbury, Connecticut, discussing theology and church governance with Ebenezer White and his followers. Over the next four months, Sandeman and his party traveled to New York, Philadelphia, New London, Connecticut, Providence, Rhode Island, and finally Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Sandeman established his first church in Portsmouth on 4 May 1765, accompanied by James Cargill, Andrew Oliphant, and his nephews. Within the month, Sandeman returned to Boston and established his second meetinghouse at the home of Edward Foster. From Boston, he returned to Danbury and created his third church among White&#x27;s followers, with Joseph Moss White and himself serving as elders. Sandeman referred to his church as &quot;formal&quot; to distinguish it from Ebenezer White&#x27;s church, which retained traditional church authority.

Colonial resistance to Sandemanianism initially stemmed from the absence of ministerial authority within their congregations. This lack of a central authority challenged the existing social fabric throughout New England, which relied upon the &quot;state&quot; to enforce church orthodoxy. As many colonials rose in protest of punitive Crown policies in the decade following Robert Sandeman&#x27;s arrival, his followers remained passively loyal in Paul&#x27;s footsteps, setting the stage for bitter estrangement between the factions. It was not until Sandeman&#x27;s passing in 1771 that the remnants of the Danbury church moved to New Haven and formed the fourth church in America. Sandemanians as a whole were labeled &quot;Loyalists&quot; for their pacifist stance, to conform with Paul&#x27;s teachings, since they did not oppose the crown like so many of their colonial brethren. Besides passivism, many Boston congregations evacuated with the British. It went into exile in Halifax, Nova Scotia, further escalating the fears of their colonial brethren. This relocation to Halifax led to the formation of the fifth church. A Boston printer, Mr. John Howe followed the British lead to Canada with his family, only to return alone with the British army to document the unfolding war story upon its return to New York. The&#x27;History of Danbury, Connecticut, 1684-1896&#x27;, by James Montgomery Bailey, mentions three additional Sandemanian congregations located in Taunton, Massachusetts, Newtown, Connecticut, and the Plumtrees district of Bethel, Connecticut. It is not clear what role, if any, Robert Sandeman played in the establishment of these congregations. However, the Boston records indicate he performed several marriages in that city during the winter and spring of 1767 to 1768. Many Loyalist Sandemanians were uprooted during the revolution and lost most of their property. John Howe&#x27;s story exemplifies this situation. In his case, he sailed to Nova Scotia and became an elder in the congregation that formed.

===Decline===

The last of the Sandemanian churches in America ceased to exist in 1890. The London meeting house finally closed in 1984. The last Elder of the Church died in Edinburgh in 1999.

Their exclusiveness in practice, neglect of education for the ministry, and the antinomian tendency of their doctrine contributed to their dissolution. Many Glasites joined the general body of Scottish Congregationalists, and the denomination has long been considered extinct.

== Critics of Sandemanianism ==
A prominent critic of Sandemanian beliefs was Baptist Andrew Fuller (1754–1815), who published &quot;Strictures on Sandemanianism&quot; (1812), in which he argued that if faith concerns the mind only, then there could be no way to distinguish genuine Christians from nominal Christians. He also argued that knowing Christ is more than mental knowledge of facts about Him; it involves a desire for fellowship with Him and a delight in His presence.

John &quot;Rabbi&quot; Duncan said once that Sandemanianism was &quot;the doctrine of justifying righteousness along with the Popish doctrine of faith.&quot;

==Sandemanian families and notable members==
Prominent Sandemanian families include the surnames Barnard, Baynes, Baxter, Boosey, Bell, Deacon, Faraday, Leighton, Mann, Vincent, Whitelaw and Young. There was a strong link between the Sandemanians and scientists. Notable members of the Sandemanian Church include William Godwin, Michael Faraday, Charles Wilson Vincent and James Baynes.

The Sandemanian church and its members are mentioned several times in Edward Everett Hale&#x27;s short story &quot;The Brick Moon&quot;. In Hale&#x27;s short story &quot;My Double, and How He Undid Me,&quot; the main character and narrator is a Sandemanian minister.

==Archives==
The archives of the Glasite Church are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee and have attracted researchers from America.

<text>Hatay Province (, , ) is the southernmost province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey. Its area is , and its population is 1,686,043 (2022). It is situated mostly outside Anatolia, along the eastern coast of the Levantine Sea. The province borders Syria to its south and east, the Turkish province of Adana to the northwest, Osmaniye to the north, and Gaziantep to the northeast. It is partially situated on the Cilician Plain, a large fertile plain along the Cilicia region. Its administrative capital is Antakya (ancient Antioch), making it one of the three Turkish provinces not named after its administrative capital or any settlement. The second-largest city is İskenderun (formerly Alexandretta). Sovereignty over most of the province remains disputed with neighbouring Syria, which claims that the province had a demographic Arab majority, and has separated from its territory in violation of the terms of the French Mandate for Syria that was established on the heels of World War I.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
Settled since the early Bronze Age, Hatay was once part of the Akkadian Empire, then of the Amorite Kingdom of Yamhad. Later, it became part of the Kingdom of Mitanni, then the area was ruled by a succession of Hittites and Neo-Hittite peoples that later gave the modern province of Hatay its name.

The Neo-Hittite kingdom of Palistin was also located here.

The area came under the control of Assyrians (except for a brief occupation by Urartu), and later the Neo-Babylonians and the Persians.

The region was the centre of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, home to the four Greek cities of the Syrian tetrapolis (Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, Apamea, and Laodicea). From 64 BC onwards the city of Antioch became an important regional centre of the Roman Empire.

Among the famous archaeological sites in the province are Alalakh, Tell Tayinat, Tell Judaidah, and Antioch.

=== Medieval era ===

The area was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in 638 and later it came under the control of the Umayyad and Abbasid Arab dynasties. Tulunids briefly ruled it before Abbasid one was restored. From the 10th century onwards, the region was controlled by the Aleppo-based Hamdanids after a brief rule of Ikhshidids. In 969 the city of Antioch was recaptured by the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by Philaretos Brachamios, a Byzantine general in 1078. He founded a principality from Antioch to Edessa. It was captured by Suleiman I, who was Sultan of Rum (ruler of Anatolian Seljuks), in 1084. It passed to Tutush I, Sultan of Aleppo (ruler of Syria Seljuks), in 1086. Seljuk rule lasted 14 years until Hatay&#x27;s capture by the Crusaders in 1098, when parts of it became the centre of the Principality of Antioch. At the same time, much of Hatay was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, who subsequently allied with the Mongols and took control of the Principality of Antioch in 1254. Hatay was captured from the Mongol-Armenian alliance by the Mameluks in 1268, who subsequently lost it to Timur (Tamerlane) at the start of the 15th century.

=== Sanjak of Alexandretta ===
By the time it was taken from the Mameluks by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I in 1516, Antakya was a medium-sized town on of land between the Orontes River and Mount Habib Neccar. Under the Ottomans the area was known as the sanjak (or governorate) of Alexandretta. Gertrude Bell in her book &quot;Syria: The Desert &amp; the Sown&quot; published in 1907 wrote extensively about her travels across Syria including Antioch &amp; Alexandretta and she noted the heavy mix between Turks and Arabs in the region at that time.

Many say that Alexandretta was traditionally part of Syria. Maps as far back as 1764 confirm this. During the First World War, most of Syria was occupied by the British but under the Armistice of Mudros, Hatay remained part of the Ottoman Empire. Nevertheless, after the armistice it was occupied by the British, an arrangement which was not accepted by the Ottomans. Later, the province was handed over to France along with the rest of Syria.

After World War I and the Turkish War of Independence, the Ottoman Empire was disbanded and the modern Republic of Turkey was created. Alexandretta was not part of the new republic. It was placed under the French mandate of Syria after the Allies and Turkey signed the Treaty of Sèvres, which was neither ratified by the Ottoman parliament nor by the Turkish National Movement in Ankara. The subsequent Treaty of Lausanne also put Alexandretta within Syria. The document detailing the boundary between Turkey and Syria around 1920 and subsequent years is presented in a report by the Official Geographer of The Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the US Department of State. A French-Turkish treaty of 20 October 1921 rendered the Sanjak of Alexandretta autonomous, and it remained so from 1921 to 1923. Out of 220,000 inhabitants in 1921, 87,000 were Turks. Along with Turks the population of the Sanjak included: Arabs of various religious denominations (Sunni Muslims, Alawites, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Maronites); Jews; Assyrians; Kurds; and Armenians. In 1923 Hatay was attached to the State of Aleppo, and in 1925 it was directly attached to the French mandate of Syria, still with special administrative status.

Despite this, a Turkish community remained in Alexandretta, and Mustafa Kemal said that Hatay had been a Turkish homeland for 4,000 years. This was due to the contested nationalist pseudoscientific Sun Language Theory prevalent in the 1930s in Turkey, which presumed that some ancient peoples of Anatolia and the Middle East, such as the Sumerians and Hittites, hence the name Hatay, were related to the Turks. Whereas, the Turks first appeared in Anatolia during the 11th century, when the Seljuk Turks occupied the eastern province of the Abbasid Empire and captured Baghdad. Resident Arabs organised under the banner of Arabism, and in 1930, Zaki al-Arsuzi, a teacher and lawyer from Arsuz on the coast of Alexandretta published a newspaper called &#x27;Arabism&#x27; in Antioch that was shut down by Turkish and French authorities.

The 1936 elections returned two MPs favouring the independence of Syria from France, and this prompted communal riots as well as passionate articles in the Turkish and Syrian press. This then became the subject of a complaint to the League of Nations by the Turkish government concerning alleged mistreatment of the Turkish populations. Atatürk demanded that Hatay become part of Turkey claiming that the majority of its inhabitants were Turks. However, the French High Commission estimated that the population of 220,000 inhabitants was made up of 46% Arabs (28% Alawites, 10% Sunni, 8% Christians), 39% Turks, 11% Armenians, while the remaining 4% was made up of Circassians, Jews, and Kurds. The sanjak was given autonomy in November 1937 in an arrangement brokered by the League. Under its new statute, the sanjak became &quot;distinct but not separated&quot; from the French mandate of Syria on the diplomatic level, linked to both France and Turkey for defence matters.

===Hatay State===
Hatay State (, , ), also known informally as the Republic of Hatay, was a transitional political entity that existed from 7 September 1938, to 29 June 1939, in the territory of the Sanjak of Alexandretta of the French Mandate of Syria. 

In early March 1939 - French authorities were willing to return Hatay Province (then within the French Mandate of Syria) back to Turkey for a quid pro-quo. The quid pro-quo was a willingness to sign a mutual pact (between Turkey and France) against potential European aggression (either Italy aggression or Germany aggression). The goal of the french was to ensue Turkey did not go into the German-Italian sphere of influence. 

The state was transformed de jure into the Hatay Province of Turkey on 7 July 1939, de facto joining the country on 23 July 1939.

===Hatay Province of Turkey===
On 29 June 1939, following a referendum, Hatay became a Turkish province. This referendum has been labelled both &quot;phoney&quot; and &quot;rigged&quot;, and is seen as a way for the French to cede the area to Turkey, in the hope that they would turn on Hitler. For the referendum, Turkey moved tens of thousands of Turks into Alexandretta so they could vote. These Turks were born in Hatay but now they were living in other regions of Turkey. In two government communiqués which were issued in 1937 and 1938, the Turkish government asked all local government authorities to make lists of all of their employees who were originally from Hatay. Those employees whose names were listed were then sent to Hatay so they could register as citizens and vote.

Syrian President Hashim al-Atassi resigned in protest at continued French intervention in Syrian affairs, maintaining that the French were obliged to refuse the annexation under the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence of 1936.

The Hassa district of Gaziantep, Dörtyol district (Erzin was nahiya of it) of Adana were then incorporated into Hatay. As a result of the annexation, a number of demographic changes occurred in Hatay. During the six months following the annexation, inhabitants over the age of 18 were given the right to choose between staying and becoming Turkish citizens, or emigrating to the French Mandate of Syria or Greater Lebanon and acquiring French citizenship. If they chose to emigrate, they were given 18 months to bring in their movable assets and establish themselves in their new states. Almost half of the Sunni Arabs left. Many Armenians also left and 1,068 Armenian families were relocated from the six Armenian villages of Musa Dagh to the Beqaa Valley which is located in Lebanon. Many of these Armenians had fled for their lives and settled in the French Mandate of Syria because they were survivors of the genocide which had previously been committed by the Ottoman Empire. The total number of people who left for Syria was estimated to be 50,000 including 22,000 Armenians, 10,000 Alawites, 10,000 Sunni Arabs and 5,000 Arab Christians.

===Turkish–Syrian dispute===

For much of its premodern history, Alexandretta, with its capital city Antioch, was considered as part of Bilad al-Sham, the area known today as Syria. In Ottoman times, Hatay was part of the Vilayet of Aleppo in Ottoman Syria. In 1920 the sanjak (province) of Alexandretta was awarded to Syria by the League of Nations in the guise of a French mandate. In 1936 Alexandretta became the subject of a complaint to the League of Nations by Turkey, which claimed that the privileges of the Turkish plurality in the sanjak were being infringed. (In 1921, there were 87,000 Turks amid a population of 220,000.) Unlike other regions historically belonging to Syrian provinces (such as Aintab, Kilis and Urfa), Alexandretta was confirmed as Syrian territory in the Treaty of Lausanne agreed upon by Kemal Atatürk but was granted a special autonomous status because it contained a Turkish plurality. 
However, culminating a series of border disputes with France-mandated Syria, Atatürk obtained in 1937 an agreement with France recognising Alexandretta as an independent state, and in 1939 this state, called the Republic of Hatay, was annexed to Turkey as the 63rd Turkish province following a controversial referendum. Syria bitterly disputed both the separation of Alexandretta and its subsequent annexation to Turkey.

Syria maintains that the separation of Alexandretta violated France&#x27;s mandatory responsibility to maintain the unity of Syrian lands (article 4 of the mandate charter). It also disputes the results of the referendum held in the province because, according to a League of Nations commission that registered voters in Alexandretta in 1938, Turkish voters in the province represented no more than 46% of the population. Syria continues to consider Hatay part of its territory as of the 2010s, and shows it as such on its maps. At the same time, Turkey and Syria have strengthened their ties and opened the border between the two countries.

Syrians hold the view that this land was illegally ceded to Turkey by France, the mandatory occupying power of Syria in the late 1930s. Syria still considers it an integral part of its own territory. Syrians call this land &quot;Liwa&#x27; aliskenderun&quot; () rather than the Turkish name of Hatay. Official Syrian maps still show Hatay as part of Syria.

Under the leadership of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from 2000 onwards, there was a lessening of tensions over the Hatay issue. Indeed, in early 2005, when visits from Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan opened a way to discussions between two states. These discussions resulted with the Syrian government agreeing to end its demand that the province should be returned under Syrian sovereignty as a condition to end hostilities; however, there was no official announcement by the Syrians relinquishing their rights of sovereignty.

Following changes to Turkish land registry legislation in 2003, a large number of properties in Hatay were purchased by Syrian nationals, mostly people who had been residents of Hatay since the 1930s but had retained their Syrian citizenship and were buying the properties that they already occupied. By 2006, the amount of land owned by Syrian nationals in Hatay exceeded the legal limit for foreign ownership of 0.5%, and sale of lands to foreigners was prohibited.

There has been a policy of cross border cooperation, on the social and economic level, between Turkey and Syria starting in the 2000s. This allowed families divided by the border to freely visit each other during the festive periods of Christmas and Eid. In December 2007, up to 27,000 people crossed the border to visit their brethren on the other side. In the wake of an agreement in the autumn of 2009 to lift visa requirements, nationals of both countries can travel freely. However, out of 50 agreements signed between Turkey and Syria in December 2009, the Hatay dispute stalled a water agreement over the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Turkey asked Syria to publicly recognise Hatay as a Turkish territory before signing on to the agreement.

Apart from maps showing Hatay as Syrian territory, the Syrian policy has been to avoid discussing Hatay and giving evasive answers when asked to specify Syrian future goals and ambitions with regard to the area. This has included a complete media silence on the issue. In February 2011, the dispute over Hatay was almost solved. The border separating Syria from Hatay was going to be blurred by a shared Friendship Dam on the Orontes river and as part of this project the two states had agreed on the national jurisdiction on each side of the border. Only weeks before the outbreak of the Syrian uprising and later war, groundbreaking ceremonies were held in Hatay and Idlib. As a result of the Syrian war and the extremely tense Turkish-Syrian relations it brought, construction was halted. As part of the ongoing war, the question of the sovereignty of Hatay has resurfaced in Syria and the Syrian media silence has been broken. Syrian media began broadcasting documentaries on the history of the area, the Turkish annexation and Turkification policies. Syrian newspapers have also reported on demonstrations in Hatay and on organizations and parties in Syria demanding an &quot;end to the Turkish occupation&quot;. However, although the Syrian government has repeatedly criticized the Turkish policies towards Syria and the armed rebel groups operating on Syrian territory, it has not officially brought up the question of Hatay.

=== 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes ===

Hatay Province was heavily damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes. The province registered 23,065 earthquake-related fatalities and 30,762 injuries. More than 13,500 buildings collapsed, 67,346 were heavily damaged and 8,162 had to be demolished. The most affected areas were Antakya, Kırıkhan and İskenderun.

==Geography==

Hatay is traversed by the north-easterly line of equal latitude and longitude. 46% of the land is mountain, 33% plain and 20% plateau and hillside. The most prominent feature is the north-south leading Nur Mountains and the highest peak is Mığırtepe (2,240m), other peaks include Ziyaret dağı and Keldağ (Jebel Akra or Casius) at 1,739 m. The folds of land that make up the landscape of the province were formed as the land masses of Arabian-Nubian Shield and Anatolia have pushed into each other, meeting here in Hatay, a classic example of the Horst–graben formation. The Orontes River rises in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and runs through Syria and Hatay, where it receives the Karasu and the Afrin River. It flows into the Mediterranean at its delta in Samandağ. There was a lake in the plain of the Amik Valley, but it was drained in the 1970s and today Amik is the largest of the plains and an important agricultural center. The climate is typical of the Mediterranean, with warm wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mountain areas inland are drier than the coast. There are some mineral deposits, İskenderun is home to Turkey&#x27;s largest iron and steel plant, and the district of Yayladağı produces a colourful marble called &quot;Rose of Hatay&quot;.

===Climate===

Hatay has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) or a dry-summer humid subtropical climate (Trewartha: &#x27;wet&#x27; &quot;Cs&quot; or &quot;Cf&quot;) which has hot, long and dry summers and mild, rainy winters.

==Districts==
Hatay province is divided into 15 districts, listed below with their populations officially estimated as at 31 December 2022:
* Altınözü (60,344)
* Antakya (399,045)
* Arsuz (101,233)
* Belen (34,449)
* Defne (165,494)
* Dörtyol (128,941)
* Erzin (41,558)
* Hassa (56,675)
* İskenderun (251,682)
* Kırıkhan (121,028)
* Kumlu (13,333)
* Payas (43,919)
* Reyhanlı (108,092)
* Samandağ (123,447)
* Yayladağı (36,803)
==Demographics==
The majority of the population adheres to either Sunni Islam or Alawism, but other minorities are also present, including Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholic, Maronite, Antiochian Greek and Armenian communities. The village of Vakıflı in the district of Samandağ is Turkey&#x27;s last remaining rural Armenian community. Arabs form the majority in three districts out of the twelve: Samandağ (&quot;Suwaidiyyah&quot;) (Alawi), Altınözü (&quot;Qusair&quot;) and Reyhanlı (&quot;Rihaniyyah&quot;) (Sunni). Unlike most Mediterranean provinces, Hatay has not experienced mass migration from other parts of Turkey in recent decades and has therefore preserved much of its traditional culture; for example, Arabic is still widely spoken in the province. To celebrate this cultural mix, in 2005 &quot;Hatay Meeting of Civilisations&quot; congress was organised by Dr Aydın Bozkurt of Mustafa Kemal University and his &quot;Hatay Association for the Protection of Universal Values&quot;.

During the Syrian Civil War, the province has experienced an influx of refugees. According to official figures, as of 21 April 2016, 408,000 Syrian refugees lived in the province.

===Language===
As of 2016, 85% of Arabic-heritage-speaking people in relevant parts of Hatay, specifically those who hear and may use the language on a daily basis, believed its use was decreasing; the rest disagree. The Arabic-speaking Antiochian Greek Christian minority has the right to teach Arabic under the Treaty of Lausanne; however, they tend to refrain from doing so to avoid sectarian tensions as the treaty does not apply to the Muslim majority.

===Population===

==Education==

Mustafa Kemal University is one of Turkey&#x27;s newer tertiary institutions, founded in İskenderun and Antakya in 1992.

==Transport==
The province is served by Hatay Airport, as well as inter-city buses.

===Cuisine===
Hatay is warm enough to grow tropical crops such as sweet potato and sugar cane, and these are used in the local cuisine, along with other local specialities including a type of cucumber/squash called kıtte. Well-known dishes of Hatay are its local variety of a widespread syrup-rich shredded pastry, künefe (kanafeh), squash cooked in onions and tomato paste (sıhılmahsi), aubergine and tahini paste (Baba ghanoush), chickpea and tahini paste hummus and dishes such as kebab found throughout Turkey. Particular spice mixes and herb mixes are popular. Pastes include:
*walnut and spice paste, muhammara
*thyme and parsley paste, Za&#x27;atar

Animal products include spicy köfte: oruk (i̇çli köfte); and a spicy sun-dried cheese, surke.

Syrup of pomegranate (nar ekşisi) is Hatay&#x27;s hallmark salad dressing.

In the movie, set in 1938, the Nazis offer the Sultan of Hatay (a monarchy which the province never had in real life) precious valuables to compensate for removing the Grail from his borders. He ignores the valuables, but accepts their Rolls-Royce Phantom II.
* The Turkish film &quot;Propaganda&quot; (1999) by Sinan Çetin, portrays the difficult materialisation of the Turkish-Syrian border in 1948, cutting through villages and families. 
* The 2001 film &quot;Şelale&quot; by local director Semir Aslanyürek was filmed in Hatay.

<text>A supernormal stimulus or superstimulus is an exaggerated version of a stimulus to which there is an existing response tendency, or any stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which it evolved.

For example, it is possible to create artificial bird eggs which certain birds will prefer over their own eggs, particularly evident in brood parasitism. Some speculate humans can be similarly exploited by junk food. Organisms tend to show a preference for the stimulus properties (e.g. size, colour, etc.) that have evolved in nature, but when offered an artificial exaggerated stimulus, animals will show behaviour in favour of the artificial stimulus over the naturally occurring stimulus. A variety of organisms display or are susceptible to supernormal stimuli, including insects, birds, and humans.

Supernormal stimuli are present in areas of biology and psychology, but are also studied within other fields like sociology and art.

British academic Nigel Spivey demonstrates the effect in the first episode of the 2005 BBC documentary series &quot;How Art Made the World&quot; to illustrate neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran&#x27;s speculation that this might be the reason for the exaggerated body image demonstrated in works of art from the Venus of Willendorf right up to the present day.

== Causation ==
Animals exhibiting, or responding to, characteristics that represent a supernormal stimulus usually display them as a result of selective pressures. Co-evolution between animals displaying supernormal stimuli, and the organisms responding to the supernormal stimuli, rely on evolution and propagation of genetics, behavioral patterns, and other biological factors. Supernormal stimuli such as emphasized color, size, patterns, or shapes, are often successful because an organism that exhibits them will often be selected by an organism that favors it. This will ensure survival and increased reproductive fitness of current and later generations.  

== In biology ==

In the 1950s, Konrad Lorenz observed that birds would select brooding eggs that resembled those of their own species but which were larger. Niko Tinbergen, coined this term through his research, which discovered that experimenters could display an alternate target that attract an organism&#x27;s attention more so than the naturally occurring target. Tinbergen studied herring gulls, and found the chicks peck at the red spot located on their parent&#x27;s bill. The offspring targets the red spot due to the contrast of color (stimulus). They do this in order to receive food through regurgitation from the parent. Tinbergen and colleagues developed an experiment that presented different models to chicks and determined their pecking rates. They used different models including an adult herring gull&#x27;s natural head, a standard wooden model of its head, the bill only, and a red stick with smaller white markings on it. The pecking rate of the chicks were consistent with the natural head, standard head model, and the bill only model. The pecking rate of the chicks increased when presented with the stick model. This suggests that the chicks preferred the dramatic contrast of the red stick with the yellow markings, therefore the artificial stimulus of the stick model was favored over the basic herring gull head and bill models, proving that the artificial stimuli was favored over the naturally occurring stimuli. Following his extensive analysis of the stimulus features that elicited food-begging in the chick of the herring gull, he constructed an artificial stimulus consisting of a red knitting needle with three white bands painted around it; this elicited a stronger response than an accurate three-dimensional model of the parent&#x27;s head (white) and bill (yellow with a red spot).

Tinbergen and his students studied other variations of this effect. He experimented with dummy plaster eggs of various sizes and markings finding that most birds preferred ones with more exaggerated markings than their own, more saturated versions of their color, and a larger size than their own. Small songbirds which laid light blue grey-dappled eggs preferred to sit on a bright blue black polka-dotted dummy so large they slid off repeatedly. Territorial male stickleback fish would attack wooden floats with red undersides—attacking them more vigorously than invading male sticklebacks if the underside were redder.

Lorenz and Tinbergen accounted for the supernormal stimulus effect in terms of the concept of the innate releasing mechanism; however this concept is no longer widely used. The core observation that simple features of stimuli may be sufficient to trigger a complex response remains valid, however.

In 1979, the term supernormal stimulus was used by Richard Dawkins and John Krebs to refer to the exaggeration of pre-existing signs induced by social parasites, noting the manipulation of baby birds (hosts) from these, to illustrate the effectiveness of those signals.

In 1983, entomologists Darryl Gwynne and David Rentz reported on the beetle &quot;Julodimorpha bakewelli&quot; attempting to copulate with discarded brown stubbies (a type of beer bottles) studded with tubercules (flattened glass beads). This work won them the 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in biology.

Another example of this is the study made by Mauck and colleagues, where they evaluated the effects of a plant pathogen named cucumber mosaic virus or CMV. This study showed that the aphids preferred the healthy plants but are still attracted by the infected plants, because of the manipulation of volatile compounds used by plants to attract them.

=== Insects ===
Pollinators, like butterflies, show behavioral response(s) to supernormal stimuli through intersexual communication. Butterflies use olfactory cues, but primarily rely on visual forms of communication, due to wind and temperature affecting their sense of smell. Sexually active butterflies will perch and wait for a mate. Once an object is detected, the butterfly can determine if the color and movement patterns are of a sexually receptive butterfly. In certain species, like the silver-washed fritillary butterfly (&quot;Argynnis paphia&quot;), the male butterfly will exhibit high contrast sensitivity and well-developed visual acuity. A more dramatic contrast of color (or movement pattern) resembling, but further emphasizing the traits of the female butterfly, could alter this usual behavior in males. Studies show that the male silver-washed fritillary butterfly select a monochromatic orange paper model, over receptive female butterflies who portrayed their usual coloration/markings.

=== Manipulation by parasites ===
In 2001, Holen et al., analyzed the evolutionary stability of hosts manipulation through exaggerated signals. Their model indicated that intensity of parasitic signals must be below a threshold to ensure acceptance from host. This threshold depends directly on the range of parasitism.

Supernormal stimuli can be exhibited by brood parasites, for example, the parasitic cuckoo chick and parental care by reed warblers. Brood parasites have evolved more dramatic colors, sizes, patterns, and/or shapes that lead to the parasite being interpreted as healthier or more preferable, in contrast to neighboring offspring. Cuckoo chicks are often successful because their begging calls, the supernormal stimulus, are representative of an entire reed warbler brood. Due to the host parent&#x27;s evolutionary instinct, elicited by selective pressures, they will select this exaggerated form of the stimulus. These calls will cause the host parent to primarily invest energy into the parasitic chick and provide it with additional food resources. Studies show that the supernormal stimuli in cuckoo chicks alter the foraging behavior in parental reed warblers.

For them, the only evolutionary stable strategy is when the host accepts all signs of the parasite with optimal intensity, which must be below the threshold; if this is not the case, the host can use these signals to identify the parasite.

==== Maladaptive behavior ====
Maladaptive behaviors are shown by organisms that display a preference for supernormal stimuli over naturally occurring stimuli. This is often based on instinct to gather as many resources as possible in a resource-sparse environment. It can also be instinctual for certain species to select the supernormal stimuli that will suggest the best energy investment of the individual, often parental investment. The selection of the supernormal stimuli must also simultaneously outweigh the cost of the behavior in order for it to evolve. This is shown in the cuckoo chick and the effects on host reed warblers. These parasitic chicks exhibit irresistible begging calls toward the parental host. This occurs as a result of selective pressures. The reed warbler increases foraging efforts to feed the parasitic chick and its own offspring. As a result, this shows a maladaptive behaviour of the host reed warbler as it is investing into a chick that is not biologically related, which does not provide reproductive fitness gain.

==== Biodiversity concerns ====
The significance of supernormal stimuli and brood parasitism or in various other species susceptible to environmental manipulation, is that this can drastically reduce the population numbers of the respective species. Brood parasitism can cause host parents to ignore their own offspring or display a higher parental investment into the parasite. Animals that are at risk of extinction, extirpation, or vulnerability will be impacted by supernormal stimuli present in brood parasites.

== In psychology ==

Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. In her 2010 book, &quot;Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose&quot;, she examines the impact of supernormal stimuli on the diversion of impulses for nurturing, sexuality, romance, territoriality, defense, and the entertainment industry&#x27;s hijacking of our social instincts. In her earlier book &quot;Waistland&quot;, she explains junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats and television as an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Modern artifacts may activate instinctive responses which evolved prior to the modern world, where breast development was a sign of health and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient.

In a cross-cultural study, Doyle and Pazhoohi showed that surgically augmented breasts are supernormal stimuli, and they are more attractive than natural breasts, regardless of their size. Also in a theoretical paper, Doyle proposed that how women walk creates supernormal stimuli through continuously alternating motion of the waist and hips causing peak shifts in perceptions of physical attractiveness involving women&#x27;s waist-to-hip ratio. Furthermore, Pazhoohi et al. (2019) using eye tracking confirmed that lower than optimal waist-to-hip ratios are supernormal stimuli and they may generate peak shifts in responding.

Pascal Boyer has suggested that music is a superstimulus targeting human affinity for speech, and that symmetrical textile and building patterns are superstimuli targeted to the visual cortex.

== In art ==
Costa and Corazza (2006), examining 776 artistic portraits covering the whole history of art, showed that eye roundness, lip roundness, eye height, eye width, and lip height were significantly enhanced in artistic portraits compared to photographic ones matched for sex and age. In a second study, forty-two art academy students were requested to draw two self-portraits, one with a mirror and one without (from memory). Eye and lip size and roundness were greater in artistic self-portraits. These results show that the exaggeration and &quot;supernormalization&quot; of key features linked to attractiveness, such as eye and lip size, are frequently found in art. 
Pazhoohi et al. (2019) showed that classic contrapposto pose is considered more attractive and provided evidence and insight as to why, in artistic presentation, goddesses of beauty and love are often depicted in contrapposto pose.

<text>William Ralph Blass (June 22, 1922 – June 12, 2002) was an American fashion designer. He was the recipient of many fashion awards, including seven Coty Awards and the Fashion Institute of Technology&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award (1999).

==Early life==
Blass was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the son of Ralph Aldrich Blass, a traveling hardware salesman, and his wife, Ethyl (Keyser) Blass.

In his autobiography, Blass wrote that the margins in his school books were filled with sketches of Hollywood-inspired fashions instead of notes. At fifteen, he began sewing and selling evening gowns for $25 each to a New York manufacturer. At seventeen he had saved enough money to move to Manhattan and study fashion. At eighteen, he was the first male to win &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;&#x27;s Design for Living award. He spent his salary of $30 a week on clothing, shoes and elegant meals.

In 1943, Blass enlisted in the Army. Due to his intelligence and talent, he was assigned to the 603rd Camouflage Battalion, which came to be known as the Ghost Army. Its mission was to deceive the German Army into believing the Allies were positioned in fake locations, for example by using dummy tanks. He served in this unit at several major operations including the Battle of the Bulge, and the Rhine River crossing. The Ghost Army received the Congressional Gold Medal on March 21, 2024.

==Fashion career==

After the war, Blass returned to New York, and was promptly hired as Anne Klein&#x27;s assistant. However, he was soon fired; allegedly, Anne told him that while he had good manners, he had no talent. He was a protégé of Baron Nicholas de Gunzburg. In 1970, after two decades of success in menswear and womenswear, he bought Maurice Rentner Ltd., which he had joined in 1959, and renamed it Bill Blass Limited.

Over the next 30 years he expanded his line to include swimwear, furs, luggage, perfume, and chocolate. In 1967, he was the first American couture fashion designer to start a menswear line. That part of his business grew to offer everything from ties, socks and belts to suits and evening clothes. It was made by 18 licensees.

Like many designers, his women&#x27;s-couture collections lost money but served to promote other parts of his business. By the mid-1990s, his ready-to-wear business grossed about $9 million annually and his 97 licensing agreements had retail sales of more than $700 million a year.

His clients, many of whom were also his friends, included Happy Rockefeller, Brooke Astor, Nancy Kissinger, Jessye Norman, Gloria Vanderbilt and Patricia Buckley.

=== Design style ===
Blass is largely credited with creating the relaxed, elegant look that American fashion favored in the late 20th century. In a time period where international attention was solely focused on French fashion, Blass was able to create designs that would eventually shift the focus onto American fashion as well. Inspired by European fashion designers like Coco Chanel, Blass modernized womenswear by allowing them comfort while still maintaining a sense of glamour; he would create designs typical of sportswear, but create them using luxurious fabrics. His signature style consisted of feminine ruffles, luxury materials such as mink or cashmere, and sharply-cut, simple silhouettes.

Blass&#x27;s looks would incorporate Golden Age Hollywood&#x27;s glamour with sportswear, taking sportswear silhouettes, and creating them with luxurious materials such as mink, silk, and cashmere, or blending pieces traditionally found in sportswear with dramatic ball skirts. Blass was the first American to incorporate fabrics traditionally only found in menswear, such as pinstripes and houndstooth, into womenswear. His clothing was always very wearable, a characteristic that set him apart from his contemporaries, as most of them were focused on creating fantastical clothes.

=== Advertisements ===
Blass was one of the first designers bold enough and recognizable enough to star in his own advertisements. In one such campaign launched during the 1960&#x27;s, Blass was pictured alongside two models wielding machine guns. Text proclaiming &quot;They can&#x27;t knock off Bill Blass&quot; was emblazoned across the image. Employing witty slogans such as &quot;Positively Blassphemous&quot;, Bill Blass became a celebrity in his own right.

=== Versailles 1973 ===
During November 1973, at the Palace of Versailles, five American fashion designers, one of whom was Bill Blass, faced off against five French designers who were at the time considered to be the best of the best – Hubert de Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Emanuel Ungaro, Pierre Cardin, and Marc Bohan of Christian Dior – in a battle of fashion shows. The event is often credited as the event that put American fashion in the international spotlight.

===The Bill Blass Edition Continental Mark series===
Beginning in 1975, and continuing until 1992, Blass lent his talents to the Ford Motor Company for an edition of their Continental Mark series of automobiles. In 1976, he shared model configurations with Emilio Pucci, Hubert de Givenchy, and Cartier. Each year, as goes true fashion, the interior and exterior color combinations would be updated. One of the most popular was the 1979 edition honoring a nautical theme, as did the Blass logo of the time. Small anchors were incorporated into the exterior accent striping and interior accents within the Blass &quot;back-to-back B&quot; design theme. The 1979 through 1983 Mark series Blass models were available with a &quot;carriage roof&quot; giving a convertible top look to the cars. After 1983, the Bill Blass edition became a color option with rear quarter window model designations and a few features that were options on the standard model.
== Awards and recognition ==
Over the years, Blass won three Coty American Fashion Critics Awards. He won the 1968 Coty for men&#x27;s wear. The Council of Fashion Designers of American awarded Blass their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987 and was the group&#x27;s first winner of their Humanitarian Leadership Award in 1996. He was also named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame List.

==New York Public Library==
In 1994, Blass gave $10 million to the New York Public Library. In recognition of the gift, the Public Catalog Room of the New York Public Library Main Branch at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was named the Bill Blass Public Catalogue Room.

==Retirement and death==
In 1999, Blass sold Bill Blass Limited for $50 million to Michael Groveman and retired to his home in New Preston, Connecticut. Blass, longtime a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with oral/tongue cancer in 2000, not long after he began writing his memoir. His cancer later developed into throat cancer, resulting in his death on June 12, 2002, ten days away from his 80th birthday.

Blass collected art and was a connoisseur of antiquities and in his will bequeathed half of his $52 million estate, as well as several important ancient sculptures, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

== Quotes ==

&quot;The beauty of being able to draw, or paint, from an early age is that you never feel trapped, least of all by your immediate circumstances.&quot;

&quot;The secret of living is not staying too long. I have learned when to leave the party.&quot;

“When in doubt, wear red.”

“Fashion can be bought by anybody; style takes discernment, it has to do with individuality.”

“Sometimes the eye gets so accustomed that if you don&#x27;t have a change, you&#x27;re bored. It&#x27;s the same with fashion, you know. And that, I suppose, is what style is about.”

“Simplicity is the soul of modern elegance.”

<text>Number 55 () is a 2014 Croatian war film directed by Kristijan Milić, billed as &quot;the first action movie&quot; about the 1991–95 Croatian War of Independence.

The film won eight Golden Arenas, including the Big Golden Arena for Best Film. The cast also includes Luka Peroš best known for his role of Marseille in &quot;Money Heist&quot;.

==Plot==
Movie takes place during the Independence War in Croatia. The film is based on a true story that happened on the eve in autumn of 1991 in the small Croatian village of Kusonje, near Pakrac. A small group of Croatian soldiers went on a patrol in an improvised armored car that they had made. In Kusonje, they get ambushed by Serb forces and are forced to hide in a nearby abandoned house that bears the house number 55. Their resistance to the rebeling forces, the JNA and Serbian special forces takes almost 24 hours. In parallel, the film follows the efforts of their fellow soldiers to pull them out of the encirclement.

<text>USS &quot;F-2&quot; (SS-21) was an F-class submarine built for the United States Navy during the 1910s.

==Description==
The F-class boats had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The F-class submarines had a crew of 1 officer and 21 enlisted men. They had a diving depth of .

For surface running, the boats were powered by two NELSECO diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the boats had a range of at and at submerged.

The F-class submarines were armed with four 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow, no reloads were carried.

==Construction and career==
The boat was named &quot;Barracuda&quot; when she was laid down by Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California, but was renamed on 17 November 1911. She was launched on 19 March 1912 sponsored by Miss A. R. Rolph, daughter of James Rolph, the mayor of San Francisco, and commissioned on 25 June 1912.

&quot;F-2&quot; joined the 1st Submarine Group, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, in operations between San Diego, California, and San Pedro, Los Angeles out of San Pedro Submarine Base, the Flotilla&#x27;s base. She continued to play an important part in developing tactics and coordinating the use of undersea craft with the fleet during an extended training period in the Hawaiian Islands&#x27;s Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor from August 1914-November 1915.

After lying in ordinary at Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 16 March 1916 – 13 June 1917, &quot;F-2&quot; became flagship of Division 1, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. Returning to operations out of San Pedro, she participated in surface and submerged exercises, torpedo-proving practice, experiments in balancing at various depths, and trained prospective crews of new submarines. On 18 September 1919, she was placed in reserve commission at San Pedro to be used in elemental school work until decommissioned at Mare Island on 16 March 1922. She was sold on 17 August.

<text>USS &quot;Barracuda&quot; (SF-4/SS-163), lead ship of her class and first of the &quot;V-boats,&quot; was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the barracuda (after USS &quot;F-2&quot;).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Barracuda&quot;′s keel was laid down at Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched as &quot;V-1&quot; (SF-4) on 17 July 1924, sponsored by Mrs. Cornelia Wolcott Snyder, wife of Captain Snyder, and commissioned on 1 October 1924. &quot;V-1&quot; and her sisters &quot;V-2&quot; (&quot;Bass&quot;) and &quot;V-3&quot; (&quot;Bonita&quot;) were the only class of the nine &quot;V-boats&quot; designed to meet the fleet submarine requirement of surface speed for operating with contemporary battleships.

== Engineering ==

&quot;V-1&quot; was completed with two Busch-Sulzer direct-drive 6-cylinder 2-cycle main diesel engines of each, along with two Busch-Sulzer auxiliary diesel engines of each, driving electrical generators. The latter were primarily for charging batteries, but to reach maximum surfaced speed, they could augment the mechanically coupled main-propulsion engines by supplying supplemental power to the 1,200 hp (890 kW) electric motors that were intended for submerged propulsion. Although it wasn&#x27;t until about 1939 that its problems were fully solved, electric transmission in a pure diesel-electric arrangement became the propulsion system for the successful fleet submarines of World War II, the &quot;Porpoise-class&quot;, and the &quot;Tambor&quot;-class through the &quot;Tench&quot;-class. Prior to recommissioning in 1940, the auxiliary diesels were replaced with two BuEng Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg AG (MAN-designed) 6-cylinder 4-cycle diesel engines of each. In 1942-43 &quot;Barracuda&quot; was converted to a cargo submarine, with the main engines removed to provide cargo space, significantly reducing her speed on the remaining auxiliary diesels.

== Construction ==

&quot;V-1&quot; had been commissioned in 1924 for surface running only, to permit an early trial of her engines. She was assigned to Submarine Division 20 and, after cruising along the New England coast, sailed on 14 January 1925 on a surface cruise of the Caribbean Sea, returning in May 1925 for completion. &quot;V-1&quot; cruised along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until November 1927.

== Operational life ==

On 8 November 1927 Squadron 20 left Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for San Diego, California, arriving 3 December. Between December 1927 and May 1932 &quot;V-1&quot; served with the Squadron on routine operations with the fleet along the west coast, in the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Caribbean. During this period her 5 inch (127 mm)/51 caliber deck gun was replaced by a 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber weapon. Her name was changed to &quot;Barracuda&quot; 9 March 1931 (for the scrapped &quot;F-2&quot;) and her hull classification symbol to SS-163, 1 July 1931. In May 1932 she went into Rotating Reserve with Submarine Division 15 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. In January 1933 &quot;Barracuda&quot; was assigned to Submarine Division 12 and, until late in 1936, operated along the west coast and cruised to Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal Zone with the fleet. On 28 October 1936 she left San Diego for the Caribbean where she took part in the Gravimetric Survey Expedition. On 8 January 1937 &quot;Barracuda&quot; sailed from St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 14 January, where she remained until placed out of commission 14 May 1937.

== Recommissioning ==

&quot;Barracuda&quot; was recommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 5 September 1940 and assigned to Submarine Division 9. She sailed from Portsmouth 2 March 1941 to Bermuda, returning in June to join Submarine Division 71. She remained in the New England area until sailing from New London, Connecticut, on 17 November 1941 to join the Pacific Fleet. She attended to duty in the Pacific Patrol Area until 15 December 1941 when she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. Between 15 December 1941 and 7 September 1942 &quot;Barracuda&quot; was attached to Submarine Division 31 and completed six war patrols in the Pacific Ocean, southwest of Panama, without enemy contacts.

&quot;Barracuda&quot; returned to Coco Solo, Canal Zone, on 7 September 1942 and, following voyage repairs, she proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul. At this time she was converted to a cargo submarine with the removal of her main engines, severely restricting her speed on the auxiliary engines. Following overhaul she was based at New London until February 1945 with Submarine Divisions 13 and 31. She operated on training problems with destroyers, other submarines, and planes in Block Island Sound. &quot;Barracuda&quot; arrived at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 16 February 1945; was decommissioned 3 March 1945; and sold 16 November 1945.

<text>USS &quot;Barracuda&quot; (SSK-1/SST-3/SS-550) (originally USS &quot;K-1&quot; (SSK-1)), the lead ship of her class, was a submarine that was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the barracuda, a voracious, pike-like fish. Her keel was laid down on 1 July 1949 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 2 March 1951 as &quot;K-1&quot;, sponsored by Mrs. Willis Manning Thomas (her late husband died as commanding officer of ), and commissioned on 10 November 1951. Notably, future President of the United States Jimmy Carter served as an officer on &quot;K-1&quot; as part of its pre-commissioning crew and during its first year of active service until he was reassigned on 16 October 1952.

The three SSK boats, &quot;Barracuda&quot; (SSK-1), &quot;Bass&quot; (SSK-2), and &quot;Bonita&quot; (SSK-3), were equipped with the large BQR-4 bow-mounted sonar array as part of Project Kayo, which experimented with the use of passive acoustics via low-frequency bow-mounted sonar arrays. When the boat was rigged for silent running, these arrays gave greatly improved convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines. The SSKs themselves were limited in their anti-submarine warfare capabilities by their low speed and their need to snorkel periodically, but the advances in sonar technology they pioneered were invaluable to later nuclear-powered submarines. The class was developed as mobilization prototypes should large numbers of Soviet submarines based on the Type XXI U-boat appear.

&quot;Barracuda&quot; joined Submarine Development Group 2, which was stationed at her home port of New London, Connecticut. She cruised along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada, in the Caribbean Sea, and made a voyage to Greenock and Rothesay, Scotland, in June 1955. On 15 December 1955 her name was changed from &quot;K-1&quot; to &quot;Barracuda&quot; (SSK-1). During intervals between and after these cruises, &quot;Barracuda&quot; operated along the eastern seaboard carrying out training and experimental exercises.

==Redesignation and service as training submarine==

In 1958, the Soviet threat changed from conventional to nuclear-powered submarines, and the SSK force was withdrawn from the SSK role and redesignated. &quot;Barracuda&quot; was redesignated SST-3 on 15 July 1959 and operated for the next several years out of Charleston, South Carolina and Key West, Florida. &quot;Barracuda&quot; was overhauled from 1963 to 1964 at Norfolk, Virginia. Her distinctive forward sonar array was removed and replaced with a streamlined bow at the submarine base in Key West Naval Base alongside – similar to submarines converted to GUPPY configurations. In 1965 she conducted training operations out of Key West.

In 1968 she was transferred to Charleston, South Carolina and served as a training platform for junior officers and enlisted personnel. On 1 August 1972 she was redesignated as SS-T3. Although, based on redesignation of her sisters as SS-551 and SS-552, the hull number SS-550 was probably reserved for her, she never officially held this designation.

==Fate==
&quot;Barracuda&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1973 at Charleston and was stricken on the same day. She was scrapped between 8 April and 8 July 1974 near Charleston, South Carolina.

<text>The Avengers, or simply Avengers, is a comic book title featuring the team the Avengers and published by Marvel Comics. The original &quot;The Avengers&quot; comic book series debuted in 1963.

==Publication history==

In 1960, DC Comics launched a comic book series featuring a team of superheroes called the Justice League. Impressed by that book&#x27;s strong sales, Martin Goodman, the owner of Marvel Comics predecessor Timely Comics, asked Stan Lee to create a title featuring a similar team of superheroes for Marvel. Lee recounts in &quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot;:

Much like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of pre-existing superhero characters created by Lee and Jack Kirby. Kirby did the artwork for the first eight issues only, in addition to doing the layouts for issues #14–16. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter, ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), with spinoffs including several annuals, miniseries and a giant-size quarterly sister series that ran briefly in the mid-1970s. Marvel filed for a trademark for &quot;The Avengers&quot; in 1967 and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.

Between 1996 and 2004, Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times. In 1996, the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; line, in which Marvel contracted outside companies to produce four titles, included a new volume of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. It took place in an alternate universe, with a revamped history unrelated to mainstream Marvel continuity. &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 2 was written by Rob Liefeld and penciled by Jim Valentino, and ran for 13 issues (Nov. 1996–Nov. 1997). The final issue, which featured a crossover with the other &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; titles, returned the characters to the main Marvel Universe.

&quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3 relaunched and ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and &quot;The Avengers&quot; #500-503 (Sept.– Dec. 2004), the one-shot &quot;Avengers Finale&quot; (Jan. 2005) became the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storyline and final issues. &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013. Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the &quot;All-New, All-Different Avengers&quot;, starting with a Free Comic Book Day preview.

===1960s===

In the first issue, the Avengers team began with Ant-Man (Hank Pym), Hulk (Bruce Banner), Iron Man (Anthony Stark), Thor, and the Wasp (Janet van Dyne). The roster changed almost immediately after the first issue; in the second issue, Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at the end of the issue, Hulk quit the team. Issue #4 brought the title&#x27;s first major milestone: the revival and return of Captain America (Steve Rogers).

===1970s===
The creative team of writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema introduced new characters such as Arkon in issue #75 (April 1970) and Red Wolf in #80 (Sept. 1970). The team&#x27;s adventures increased in scope as the team crossed into an alternate dimension and battled the Squadron Supreme, and fought in the Kree-Skrull War, which guest-starred the Kree hero, Mar-Vell/Captain Marvel. Novelist Harlan Ellison plotted two stories for the series. The first (&quot;The Summons of Psyklop&quot;) was published in issue #88 (May 1971) and the second (&quot;Five Dooms to Save Tomorrow&quot;) in #101 (July 1972).

Writer Steve Englehart introduced Mantis, who joined the team along with the reformed Swordsman.

During the summer of 1973, Englehart and artists Bob Brown and Sal Buscema produced &quot;The Avengers-Defenders Clash&quot; storyline which crossed over between the two team titles. This eight-issue story was the first summertime cross-title event, and was very popular with readers.

George Pérez became the title&#x27;s artist with issue #141 (Nov. 1975) which saw the start of a seven-part story featuring the Squadron Supreme and the Serpent Crown. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Englehart&#x27;s run on &quot;The Avengers&quot; eighth on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

After Englehart departed and a seven-issue stint by Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter began as writer, generating several classic adventures, including &quot;The Bride of Ultron&quot;, the &quot;Nefaria Trilogy&quot;, and &quot;The Korvac Saga&quot;. Shooter introduced the character of Henry Peter Gyrich, the Avengers&#x27; liaison to the United States National Security Council. The true origins of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were revealed in a three-part story that ran in issues #185-187 (July-Sept. 1979).

===1980s===
The first major development was the breakdown of Henry Pym, which writer Roger Stern resolved this by having Pym outwit Egghead and defeated the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly. Pym proved his innocence.

Stern developed several major storylines, such as &quot;Ultimate Vision&quot;; the formation of the West Coast Avengers; and &quot;Avengers Under Siege&quot;. Rogue, who would later become a member of the X-Men, was introduced in &quot;The Avengers Annual&quot; #10 (1981) by writer Chris Claremont and artist Michael Golden.

Stern created the villain, Nebula, who falsely claimed to be the granddaughter of Thanos. Following Stern&#x27;s departure, Walt Simonson wrote the series briefly but left due to editorial conflicts.

John Byrne took over writing both &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot; and merged the two separate Avengers teams into one team with two bases. Byrne&#x27;s contributions included a revamping of the Vision, and the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision were actually illusions. The Avengers titles in late 1989 were involved in the major crossover event &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot;.

===1990s===

Bob Harras and Steve Epting took over the title in the summer of 1991 and introduced a stable lineup with ongoing story lines and character development. Their primary antagonists in this run were the mysterious Proctor and his team of other-dimensional Avengers known as the Gatherers.

This culminated in &quot;&quot;, a 19-part storyline that ran through all Avengers-related titles and showcased a conflict between the Kree and the Shi&#x27;ar Empire.

Marvel contracted out &quot;The Avengers&quot; and three related titles — &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and &quot;Iron Man&quot; to former Marvel artists Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld, two of the founding creators of Image Comics. While &quot;The Avengers&quot; was relaunched as a new series, the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; line ended after a year as planned and the license reverted to Marvel.

Writer Kurt Busiek and penciler George Pérez launched a new volume of the series with &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998). Busiek concurrently wrote the limited series &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;. Busiek&#x27;s run included many of the Avengers&#x27; traditional villains.

===2000s===
Successor writer Geoff Johns dealt with the aftermath of Busiek&#x27;s Kang arc, as the Avengers were granted international authority by the United Nations. Chuck Austen followed as writer. Writer Brian Michael Bendis then rebooted the series with the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storyline.

===2010s===

All four Avengers series (&quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot;, &quot;New Avengers&quot;, &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;, and &quot;Avengers: The Initiative&quot;) were canceled, and a new ongoing series titled &quot;Avengers&quot; was launched in May 2010, written by Brian Michael Bendis and penciled by John Romita Jr.

In 2012, a biweekly &quot;Avengers&quot; title was launched, written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by different artists for each story arc. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers title (vol. 6) dubbed the &quot;All-New, All-Different Avengers&quot; launched in 2015 written by Mark Waid, with alternating artwork by Mahmud Asrar and Adam Kubert, and covers by Alex Ross. Mark Waid and Alex Ross continued with &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 7, which launched in 2017, with artwork by Mike del Mundo.

It was relaunched once again in 2018 as part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Start&quot; relaunch featuring a creative by Jason Aaron (w) and Ed McGuinness (pen).

<doc id="403517" wikidata="Q718640" url="?curid=403517" title="Leo V of Armenia">
<text>Leo V or Levon V (occasionally Levon VI; , &quot;Levon V&quot;; 1342 – 29 November 1393), of the House of Lusignan, was the last Latin king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Leo was described as &quot;Leo V, King of Armenia&quot; on his own personal seal (), and as &quot;Leo of Lusignan the Fifth&quot; in the Middle French inscription on his cenotaph: .

==Reign in Cilicia==
In 1365, Pope Urban V selected Leo as the potential ruler of Cilician Armenia, but Constantine IV ascended the throne instead. After Constantine IV&#x27;s murder, Catholicos Constantine V led the people in crowning Leo on September 14, 1374. However, his reign encountered internal opposition concerning the spiritual authority of the Pope.

Leo ruled until April 13, 1375 when he was overthrown and captured following the fall of Sis by an invading army from the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. In July 1377, he met monk Jean Dardel, who accompanied him as counselor, ambassador, and historian-biographer. Leo was held hostage in Egypt with his wife and daughter for five years until ransomed by the King of Castile, John I. In October 1382, he embarked from Alexandria to Europe.

==Life in Europe==
Leo arrived ill and poor to Medina del Campo. King John I of Castile gifted Leo V the lordship of Madrid together with those of Villa Real and Andújar in 1383. The Madrilenian &quot;concejo&quot; made sure that the privilege of lordship did not become hereditary, also presumably receiving a non-sale privilege guaranteeing never again to be handed over by the Crown to a lord. He was also provided an annual gift of 150,000 maravedis. Leon rebuilt the towers of the Royal Alacázar.

According to father Juan de Mariana, Leo left Castile for France after the death of his protector in 1390. Federico Bravo, however, states that he left after two years of ruling, and five years later, the Madrilenians were conceded the revocation of the lordship by John.

Leo V apparently went to Paris in June 1384, and received the Saint-Ouen castle and a sizable pension from King Charles VI of France. He attempted to reconcile the French and the English (at the time fighting the Hundred Years&#x27; War) in order to set up a new Crusade and obtain help to recover his lands, but the meeting he organized in 1386 between Boulogne and Calais were unsuccessful. Leo continued his diplomatic mission to England in 1389 and in 1392.

==Death==


Leo V never recovered his throne, and died in Paris on November 29, 1393. His remains were laid to rest in the Couvent des Célestins, the second most important burial site for royalty after Saint-Denis, located near what is now the Place de la Bastille in Paris. The prestigious convent was located nearby Leo&#x27;s residence of Hôtel des Tournelles, itself near Hôtel Saint-Pol, the favourite residence of Charles V and Charles VI in the area of Le Marais.

Leo received lavish funerals and had a lavish tomb, located in the choir of the church. However, the convent was profanated during the French Revolution. After the revolution, his tombstone was recovered by Alexandre Lenoir who placed it in his Musée des monuments Français in the Saint-Denis Basilica. In 1815, during the Restoration, a new cenotaph was established for Leo V at the royal Saint Denis Basilica where most representatives of the French monarchy lie.

The effigy on the tombstone, by an anonymous artist, is of a high realism and quality, and it is thought that it was made while Leo was still alive. Leo V is depicted holding a scepter (now broken) and gloves, symbol of great princes.

The tombstone bears the following inscription in Old French:
He had one legitimate daughter, Marie de Lusignan (ca 1370 – Cairo, before July 4, 1381, who predeceased her mother and father), and two illegitimate sons, Guy de Lusignan or Guido de Armenia (died 1405), a Canon in Autun, Bayeux, Paris and Arras and Captain de la Tour d&#x27;Amblay, and Stephan or Etienne de Lusignan, a Knight in Sis.

Upon his death the title of King of Armenia was claimed by Leo&#x27;s distant cousin James I of Cyprus.
