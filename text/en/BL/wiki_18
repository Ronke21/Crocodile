<text>Ivar Giæver (; anglicized as Giaever; born April 5, 1929) is a Norwegian-American physicist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics with Leo Esaki and Brian Josephson. One half of the prize was awarded jointly to Giaever and Esaki &quot;for their experimental discoveries regarding tunneling phenomena in semiconductors and superconductors, respectively&quot;.

In 1975, he was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for contributions in the discovery and elaboration of electron tunneling into superconductors.

Giaever is a professor emeritus at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the president of the company Applied Biophysics.

== Early life and education ==
Giaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim in 1952. In 1954, he emigrated from Norway to Canada, where he was employed by the Canadian division of General Electric. He moved to the United States four years later, joining General Electric&#x27;s Corporate Research and Development Center in Schenectady, New York, in 1958. He has lived in Niskayuna, New York, since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964. While working for General Electric, Giaever earned a Ph.D. degree at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1964.

== The Nobel Prize ==
The work that led to Giaever&#x27;s Nobel Prize was performed at General Electric in 1960. Following on Esaki&#x27;s discovery of electron tunnelling in semiconductors in 1958, Giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors, demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of oxide surrounded on both sides by metal in a superconducting or normal state. Giaever&#x27;s experiments demonstrated the existence of an energy gap in superconductors, one of the most important predictions of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which had been developed in 1957. Giaever&#x27;s experimental demonstration of tunnelling in superconductors stimulated the theoretical physicist Brian Josephson to work on the phenomenon, leading to his prediction of the Josephson effect in 1962. Esaki and Giaever shared half of the 1973 Nobel Prize, and Josephson received the other half.

Giaever&#x27;s research later in his career was mainly in the field of biophysics. In 1969, he researched biophysics for a year as a fellow at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, through a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he continued to work in this area after he returned to the US.

He has co-signed a letter from over 70 Nobel laureate scientists to the Louisiana Legislature supporting the repeal of Louisiana’s Louisiana Science Education Act.

== Other prizes ==
In addition to the Nobel Prize, he has also been awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Prize by the American Physical Society in 1965, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966, and the Zworykin Award by the National Academy of Engineering in 1975.

In 1985, he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

== Global warming ==
Giaever has repeatedly professed skepticism of global warming, calling it a &quot;new religion&quot;. On 13 September 2011, he resigned from the American Physical Society over its official position.

Giaever is currently a science advisor with American conservative and libertarian think tank The Heartland Institute.

==Personal life==
Giaever was married to his childhood sweetheart Inger (née Skramstad) from 1952 until her death on September 12, 2023 at the age of 94. They have four children.

Giaever is an atheist.

<doc id="396622" wikidata="Q1207972" url="?curid=396622" title="Polish space">
<text>In the mathematical discipline of general topology, a Polish space is a separable completely metrizable topological space; that is, a space homeomorphic to a complete metric space that has a countable dense subset. Polish spaces are so named because they were first extensively studied by Polish topologists and logicians—Sierpiński, Kuratowski, Tarski and others. However, Polish spaces are mostly studied today because they are the primary setting for descriptive set theory, including the study of Borel equivalence relations. Polish spaces are also a convenient setting for more advanced measure theory, in particular in probability theory.

Common examples of Polish spaces are the real line, any separable Banach space, the Cantor space, and the Baire space. Additionally, some spaces that are not complete metric spaces in the usual metric may be Polish; e.g., the open interval is Polish.

Between any two uncountable Polish spaces, there is a Borel isomorphism; that is, a bijection that preserves the Borel structure. In particular, every uncountable Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum.

[[Polish space#Lusin spaces|Lusin spaces]], [[Polish space#Suslin spaces|Suslin spaces]], and [[Radon space#Radon spaces|Radon spaces]] are generalizations of Polish spaces.

==Properties==
# Every Polish space is second countable (by virtue of being separable and metrizable).
# A subspace of a Polish space is Polish (under the induced topology) if and only if is the intersection of a sequence of open subsets of (i. e., is a -set).
# (Cantor–Bendixson theorem) If is Polish then any closed subset of can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable set. Further, if the Polish space is uncountable, it can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable open set.
# Every Polish space is homeomorphic to a -subset of the Hilbert cube (that is, of , where is the unit interval and is the set of natural numbers).

The following spaces are Polish:
* closed subsets of a Polish space,
* open subsets of a Polish space,
* products and disjoint unions of countable families of Polish spaces,
* locally compact spaces that are metrizable and countable at infinity,
* countable intersections of Polish subspaces of a Hausdorff topological space,
* the set of irrational numbers with the topology induced by the standard topology of the real line.

==Characterization==

There are numerous characterizations that tell when a second-countable topological space is metrizable, such as Urysohn&#x27;s metrization theorem. The problem of determining whether a metrizable space is completely metrizable is more difficult. Topological spaces such as the open unit interval (0,1) can be given both complete metrics and incomplete metrics generating their topology.

There is a characterization of complete separable metric spaces in terms of a game known as the strong Choquet game. A separable metric space is completely metrizable if and only if the second player has a winning strategy in this game.

A second characterization follows from Alexandrov&#x27;s theorem. It states that a separable metric space is completely metrizable if and only if it is a formula_1 subset of its completion in the original metric.

==Polish metric spaces==
Although Polish spaces are metrizable, they are not in and of themselves metric spaces; each Polish space admits many complete metrics giving rise to the same topology, but no one of these is singled out or distinguished. A Polish space with a distinguished complete metric is called a Polish metric space. An alternative approach, equivalent to the one given here, is first to define &quot;Polish metric space&quot; to mean &quot;complete separable metric space&quot;, and then to define a &quot;Polish space&quot; as the topological space obtained from a Polish metric space by forgetting the metric.

==Generalizations of Polish spaces==

===Lusin spaces===
A Hausdorff topological space is a Lusin space (named after Nikolai Lusin) if some stronger topology makes it into a Polish space.

There are many ways to form Lusin spaces. In particular:
*Every Polish space is a Lusin space
*A subspace of a Lusin space is a Lusin space if and only if it is a Borel set. 
*Any countable union or intersection of Lusin subspaces of a Hausdorff space is a Lusin space. 
*The product of a countable number of Lusin spaces is a Lusin space.
*The disjoint union of a countable number of Lusin spaces is a Lusin space.

===Suslin spaces===
A Hausdorff topological space is a Suslin space (named after Mikhail Suslin) if it is the image of a Polish space under a continuous mapping. So every Lusin space is Suslin.
In a Polish space, a subset is a Suslin space if and only if it is a Suslin set (an image of the Suslin operation).

The following are Suslin spaces:
* closed or open subsets of a Suslin space,
* countable products and disjoint unions of Suslin spaces,
* countable intersections or countable unions of Suslin subspaces of a Hausdorff topological space,
* continuous images of Suslin spaces,
* Borel subsets of a Suslin space.

They have the following properties:
* Every Suslin space is separable.

===Radon spaces===

A Radon space, named after Johann Radon, is a topological space on which every Borel probability measure on is inner regular. Since a probability measure is globally finite, and hence a locally finite measure, every probability measure on a Radon space is also a Radon measure. In particular a separable complete metric space is a Radon space.

Every Suslin space is a Radon space.

==Polish groups==

A Polish group is a topological group that is also a Polish space, in other words homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space. There are several classic results of Banach, Freudenthal and Kuratowski on homomorphisms between Polish groups. Firstly, Banach&#x27;s argument applies &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; to non-Abelian Polish groups: if and are separable metric spaces with Polish, then any Borel homomorphism from to is continuous. Secondly, there is a version of the open mapping theorem or the closed graph theorem due to Kuratowski: a continuous injective homomorphism of a Polish subgroup onto another Polish group is an open mapping. As a result, it is a remarkable fact about Polish groups that Baire-measurable mappings (i.e., for which the preimage of any open set has the property of Baire) that are homomorphisms between them are automatically continuous. The group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube is a universal Polish group, in the sense that every Polish group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of it.

Examples:
*All finite dimensional Lie groups with a countable number of components are Polish groups. 
*The unitary group of a separable Hilbert space (with the strong operator topology) is a Polish group.
*The group of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space is a Polish group.
*The product of a countable number of Polish groups is a Polish group.
*The group of isometries of a separable complete metric space is a Polish group

<text>Brian David Josephson (born 4 January 1940) is a Welsh physicist and is a professor emeritus of physics at the University of Cambridge. Best known for his pioneering work on superconductivity and quantum tunnelling, he shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics with Leo Esaki and Ivar Giaever for his discovery of the Josephson effect, made in 1962 when he was a 22 year-old PhD student at Cambridge.

Josephson has spent his academic career as a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group at Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory. He has been a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge since 1962, and served as professor of physics from 1974 until 2007.

In the early 1970s, Josephson took up transcendental meditation and turned his attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. He has expressed support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, which has made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.

==Early life and career==

===Education===
Josephson was born in Cardiff, Wales, on 4 January 1940 to Jewish parents, Mimi (née Weisbard, 1911–1998) and Abraham Josephson. He attended Cardiff High School, where he credits some of the school masters for having helped him, particularly the physics master, Emrys Jones, who introduced him to theoretical physics. In 1957, he went up to Cambridge, where he initially read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. After completing Maths Part II in two years, and finding it somewhat sterile, he decided to switch to physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldram2012/01:19mins&quot;&gt;John Waldram, &quot;John Waldram: Reminiscences&quot;, Lectures from the Cavendish Laboratory&#x27;s bdj50 conference, University of Cambridge, 18 July 2012, 01:19 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephson was known at Cambridge as a brilliant but shy student. Physicist John Waldram recalled overhearing Nicholas Kurti, an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson&#x27;s exam results with David Shoenberg, reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: &quot;Who is this chap Josephson? He seems to be going through the theory like a knife through butter.&quot; While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the Mössbauer effect, pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to &quot;Physics World&quot;, Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him a place in the history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect.

He graduated in 1960 and became a research student in the university&#x27;s Mond Laboratory on the old Cavendish site, where he was supervised by Brian Pippard. American physicist Philip Anderson, also a future Nobel Prize laureate, spent a year in Cambridge in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Josephson in a class was &quot;a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, I can assure you, because everything had to be right or he would come up and explain it to me after class.&quot; It was during this period, as a PhD student in 1962, that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect; the Cavendish Laboratory unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962, and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled &quot;Non-linear conduction in superconductors&quot;.

===Discovery of the Josephson effect===

Josephson was 22 years old when he did the work on quantum tunnelling that won him the Nobel Prize. He discovered that a supercurrent could tunnel through a thin barrier, predicting, according to physicist Andrew Whitaker, that &quot;at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage; that when there is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; and that there is a dependence on any magnetic field.&quot; This became known as the Josephson effect and the junction as a Josephson junction.

His calculations were published in &quot;Physics Letters&quot; (chosen by Pippard because it was a new journal) in a paper entitled &quot;Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling,&quot; received on 8 June 1962 and published on 1 July. They were confirmed experimentally by Philip Anderson and John Rowell of Bell Labs in Princeton; this appeared in their paper, &quot;Probable Observation of the Josephson Superconducting Tunneling Effect,&quot; submitted to &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; in January 1963.

Before Anderson and Rowell confirmed the calculations, the American physicist John Bardeen, who had shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics (and who shared it again in 1972), objected to Josephson&#x27;s work. He submitted an article to &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; on 25 July 1962, arguing that &quot;there can be no such superfluid flow.&quot; The disagreement led to a confrontation in September that year at Queen Mary College, London, at the Eighth International Conference on Low Temperature Physics. When Bardeen (then one of the most eminent physicists in the world) began speaking, Josephson (still a student) stood up and interrupted him. The men exchanged views, reportedly in a civil and soft-spoken manner. See also: .

Whitaker writes that the discovery of the Josephson effect led to &quot;much important physics,&quot; including the invention of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices), which are used in geology to make highly sensitive measurements, as well as in medicine and computing. IBM used Josephson&#x27;s work in 1980 to build a prototype of a computer that would be up to 100 times faster than the IBM 3033 mainframe.

===Nobel Prize===

Josephson was awarded several important prizes for his discovery, including the 1969 Research Corporation Award for outstanding contributions to science, and the Hughes Medal and Holweck Prize in 1972. In 1973 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the $122,000 award with two other scientists who had also worked on quantum tunnelling. Josephson was awarded half the prize &quot;for his theoretical predictions of the properties of a supercurrent through a tunnel barrier, in particular those phenomena which are generally known as the Josephson effects&quot;. The other half of the award was shared equally by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki of the Thomas Watson Research Center in Yorktown, New York, and Norwegian-American physicist Ivar Giaever of General Electric in Schenectady, New York.

===Positions held===
Josephson spent a postdoctoral year in the United States (1965–1966) as research assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. After returning to Cambridge, he was made assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1967, where he remained a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group, a theoretical physics group, for the rest of his career. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1970, and the same year was awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship by Cornell University, where he spent one year. In 1972 he became a reader in physics at Cambridge and in 1974 a full professor, a position he held until he retired in 2007.

A practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM) since the early seventies, Josephson became a visiting faculty member in 1975 of the Maharishi European Research University in the Netherlands, part of the TM movement. He also held visiting professorships at Wayne State University in 1983, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1984, and the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1987.

==Parapsychology==

===Early interest and Transcendental Meditation===

Josephson became interested in philosophy of mind in the late sixties and, in particular, in the mind–body problem, and is one of the few scientists to argue that parapsychological phenomena (telepathy, psychokinesis and other paranormal themes) may be real. In 1971, he began practising Transcendental Meditation (TM), which had been taken up by several celebrities, including the Beatles.

Winning the Nobel Prize in 1973 gave him the freedom to work in less orthodox areas, and he became increasingly involved – including during science conferences, to the irritation of fellow scientists – in talking about meditation, telepathy and higher states of consciousness. In 1974, he angered scientists during a colloquium of molecular and cellular biologists in Versailles by inviting them to read the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; (5th – 2nd century BCE) and the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the TM movement, and by arguing about special states of consciousness achieved through meditation. &quot;Nothing forces us,&quot; one scientist shouted at him, &quot;to listen to your wild speculations.&quot; Biophysicist Henri Atlan wrote that the session ended in uproar.

In May that year, Josephson addressed a symposium held to welcome the Maharishi to Cambridge. The following month, at the first Canadian conference on psychokinesis, he was one of 21 scientists who tested claims by Matthew Manning, a Cambridgeshire teenager who said he had psychokinetic abilities; Josephson apparently told a reporter that he believed Manning&#x27;s powers were a new kind of energy. He later withdrew or corrected the statement.

Josephson said that Trinity College&#x27;s tradition of interest in the paranormal meant that he did not dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore the idea that there is intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra&#x27;s &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.

===Fundamental Fysiks Group===


Josephson became involved in the mid-1970s with a group of physicists associated with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, who were investigating paranormal claims. They had organized themselves loosely into the Fundamental Fysiks Group, and had effectively become the Stanford Research Institute&#x27;s (SRI) &quot;house theorists,&quot; according to historian of science David Kaiser. Core members in the group were Elizabeth Rauscher, George Weissmann, John Clauser, Jack Sarfatti, Saul-Paul Sirag, Nick Herbert, Fred Alan Wolf, Fritjof Capra, Henry Stapp, Philippe Eberhard and Gary Zukav.

There was significant government interest at the time in quantum mechanics – the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell&#x27;s theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.

In 1976, Josephson travelled to California at the invitation of one of the Fundamental Fysiks Group members, Jack Sarfatti, who introduced him to others including laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, and quantum physicist Henry Stapp. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; covered Josephson&#x27;s visit.

Josephson co-organized a symposium on consciousness at Cambridge in 1978, publishing the proceedings as &quot;Consciousness and the Physical World&quot; (1980), with neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran. A conference on &quot;Science and Consciousness&quot; followed a year later in Cordoba, Spain, attended by physicists and Jungian psychoanalysts, and addressed by Josephson, Fritjof Capra and David Bohm (1917–1992).

By 1996, he had set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish Laboratory to explore intelligent processes in nature. In 2002, he told &quot;Physics World&quot;: &quot;Future science will consider quantum mechanics as the phenomenology of particular kinds of organised complex system. Quantum entanglement would be one manifestation of such organisation, paranormal phenomena another.&quot;

===Reception and views on the scientific community===
Josephson delivered the Pollock Memorial Lecture in 2006, the Hermann Staudinger Lecture in 2009 and the Sir Nevill Mott Lecture in 2010.

Matthew Reisz wrote in &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; in 2010 that Josephson has long been one of physics&#x27; &quot;more colourful figures.&quot; His support for unorthodox causes has attracted criticism from fellow scientists since the 1970s, including from Philip Anderson. Josephson regards the criticism as prejudice, and believes that it has served to deprive him of an academic support network.

He has repeatedly criticized &quot;science by consensus,&quot; arguing that the scientific community is too quick to reject certain kinds of ideas. &quot;Anything goes among the physics community – cosmic wormholes, time travel,&quot; he argues, &quot;just so long as it keeps its distance from anything mystical or New Age-ish.&quot; Referring to this position as &quot;pathological disbelief,&quot; he holds it responsible for the rejection by academic journals of papers on the paranormal. He has compared parapsychology to the theory of continental drift, proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener (1880–1930) to explain observations that were otherwise inexplicable, which was resisted and ridiculed until evidence led to its acceptance after Wegener&#x27;s death.

Science writer Martin Gardner criticized Josephson in 1980 for complaining to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, along with three other physicists, about an article by J. A. Wheeler that ridiculed parapsychology. Several physicists complained in 2001 when, in a Royal Mail booklet celebrating the Nobel Prize&#x27;s centenary, Josephson wrote that Britain was at the forefront of research into telepathy. Physicist David Deutsch said the Royal Mail had &quot;let itself be hoodwinked&quot; into supporting nonsense, although another physicist, Robert Matthews, suggested that Deutsch was skating on thin ice given the latter&#x27;s own work on parallel universes and time travel.

In 2004, Josephson criticized an experiment by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina that she could see inside people&#x27;s bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, responded by highlighting that the conditions of the experiment had been agreed to before it started, and the potential significance of her claims warranted a higher than normal bar. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson&#x27;s position, asserting that the experiment was &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; to determine any effect.

Josephson&#x27;s reputation for promoting unorthodox causes was cemented by his support for the ideas of water memory and cold fusion, both of which are rejected by mainstream scientists. Water memory is purported to provide a possible explanation for homeopathy; it is dismissed by a majority of scientists as pseudoscience, although Josephson has expressed support for it since attending a conference at which French immunologist Jacques Benveniste first proposed it. Cold fusion is the hypothesis that nuclear reactions can occur at room temperature. When Martin Fleischmann, the British chemist who pioneered research into it, died in 2012, Josephson wrote a supportive obituary in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, and had published in &quot;Nature&quot; a letter complaining that its obituary had failed to give Fleischmann due credit. Antony Valentini of Imperial College London withdrew Josephson&#x27;s invitation to a 2010 conference on the de Broglie-Bohm theory because of his work on the paranormal, although it was reinstated after complaints.

Josephson&#x27;s defense of paranormal claims and of cold fusion have led him to being described as an exemplar of a sufferer of the hypothetical Nobel disease.

<doc id="396632" wikidata="Q3237031" url="?curid=396632" title="Letters to the Inhabitants of Canada">
<text>The Letters to the Inhabitants of Canada were three letters written by the First and Second Continental Congresses in 1774, 1775, and 1776 to communicate directly with the population of the Province of Quebec, formerly the French province of Canada, which had no representative system at the time. Their purpose was to draw the large French-speaking population to the American revolutionary cause. This goal ultimately failed, and Quebec, along with the other northern provinces of British America, remained loyal to Britain. The only significant assistance that was gained was the recruitment of two regiments totaling not more than 1,000 men.

==Background==

The acquisition of the Province of Quebec as a result of the French and Indian War (1754–1763) gave Great Britain control over nearly the entire eastern seaboard of North America, and brought the former French colony of Canada into a closer relationship with the American colonies. The new province was significantly different from the other provinces of British America, as the vast majority of people in Quebec spoke only French and were Catholic. There were also differences in civic and legal affairs, as the law had, prior to the British conquest, been based on French law.

In 1774, the British Parliament enacted the &quot;Quebec Act&quot;, along with other 
legislation that was labeled by American colonists as the &quot;Intolerable Acts&quot;. This measure, which replaced the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as the governing document of Quebec, was used to fortify the position of the British in Quebec by guaranteeing (among other things) the rights of French Canadians to practice Catholicism. It is largely perceived by historians to be damage control in the province of Quebec, in order to prevent the French Canadians from joining the independence movement in the American colonies. The American colonists interpreted the religious provisions concerning Catholicism as a wedge by which Catholicism might be introduced into all of the colonies, and other provisions concerning the structure of the Quebec government to be an attempt by the British Parliament to assert more control over the province, and deny its people what many considered to be basic rights.

==First letter==

===Congress drafts the letter===
On October 21, 1774, the First Continental Congress, meeting to craft a united response to the Intolerable Acts, resolved to address letters to the populations of Quebec, St. John&#x27;s Island, Nova Scotia, Georgia, East Florida, and West Florida, all being colonies that were not represented by delegates in the Congress. A committee composed of Thomas Cushing, Richard Henry Lee, and John Dickinson was set up to draft those letters. A first draft was presented on October 24, debated and returned to the committee. On October 26, a new draft was presented, debated, amended and adopted. A resolution was passed for the president to sign the letter and ordering the translation and printing of a &quot;Letter to the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec&quot; to be done under the supervision of the delegates of Pennsylvania. The letter was translated to French and printed as an 18-page brochure entitled &quot;Lettre adressée aux habitans de la Province de Québec, ci-devant le Canada, de la part du Congrès général de l&#x27;Amérique Septentrionale, tenu à Philadelphie&quot;. The translation is attributed to Pierre Eugene du Simitiere. The final content of the letter is attributed to John Dickinson, as a draft in his own hand very closely resembles the final letter.

===Contents of the first letter===
The letter informed the people of Quebec of five important rights of British constitutional law which were not in force in their colony over a decade after the peace treaty of 1763, which ended the French and Indian War, and resulted in every French subject in Canada becoming a new British subject, theoretically equal in rights to all other British subjects. These five rights were representative government, trial by jury, habeas corpus, land ownership, and freedom of the press. The text quotes a passage of Cesare Beccaria&#x27;s &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; and multiple excerpts of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Laws&quot;. Quebec historian Marcel Trudel believes this first letter to have been &quot;a crash course on democratic government&quot;, while Gustave Lanctôt claims that the Congress&#x27; letter &quot;introduced [among the inhabitants] the notion of personal liberty and political equality.&quot;, calling it their first &quot;political alphabet&quot; and &quot;first lesson in constitutional law&quot;.

The people of Quebec were invited to give themselves the provincial representation the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; did not provide for, and have this representative body send delegates to the upcoming continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia on May 10, 1775.

===Distribution and reaction to the first letter===
The French-born Philadelphia printer Fleury Mesplet printed 2,000 copies of the French translation. Other manuscript French translations of the original English letter (first published in &quot;Dunlap&#x27;s Pennsylvania Packet&quot;) were in circulation as well, possibly even arriving in Canada before the &quot;official&quot; translation paid by the Congress. Wide circulation of the letter was prevented by General Guy Carleton, then Governor of the province. However, he reported to his superiors in England that, &quot;a report was spread that at Montreal that letters of importance had been received from the General Congress,&quot; and that town meetings were being held, &quot;breathing that same spirit, so plentifully gone forth through the neighbouring Provinces.&quot; These town meetings, seemingly dominated by English-speakers, ended without the election of delegates to the Continental Congress.

In early 1775, Boston&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence sent John Brown into Quebec to gather intelligence, gauge sentiment, and agitate for rebellion in that province. He found mixed sentiment among English-speaking inhabitants, some of whom were concerned that the Congress&#x27; adoption of an export boycott would essentially give the lucrative fur trade to French-speakers. The bulk of the French-speaking population was at best neutral with respect to British rule; some were happy with it, but more might be convinced to assist the Americans in their aims. Brown also noted the relatively weak military presence in the province. General Carleton, while aware of Brown&#x27;s activities, did nothing to interfere, beyond preventing publication of the letter in the local newspaper.

==Second letter==
===Drafting the second letter===
The Second Continental Congress met on May 10, 1775, following the Battles of Lexington and Concord in which colonial forces resisted a large British force on April 19 and drove it back to Boston. This victory resulted in Congress opening the session with great excitement and hope.

John Brown arrived in Philadelphia on May 17 to report the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and the raid on Fort Saint-Jean, an event that stimulated much discussion in the Congress. On May 26, the Congress resolved to draft a second letter to the inhabitants of Canada. The committee that drafted the letter was composed of John Jay, Silas Deane, and Samuel Adams, the last having previously written a letter to the people of Canada on behalf of the Boston Committee of Correspondence. On May 29, after having heard additional testimony on the situation in Montreal from James Price, a Montreal merchant, the Second Continental Congress approved the letter.

The letter, entitled &quot;Letter to the oppressed inhabitants of Canada&quot;, was translated as The letter was signed by President John Hancock, and again translated by Pierre Eugène du Simitière; 1,000 copies of it were printed by Fleury Mesplet. The content of the letter has been attributed to John Jay.
===Contents of the second letter===
In the letter, the Congress again deplored the form of the civil government introduced by the &quot;Quebec Act&quot;, which it likened to &quot;tyranny&quot;. It further asserted that under this form of government &quot;you and your wives and your children are made slaves.&quot; As for the enjoyment of their religion, the Congress believed it uncertain for it depended on &quot;a legislature in which you have no share, and over which you have no controul&quot;. The Congress was clearly hoping to draw French-speaking &quot;habitants&quot; to their cause, as well as English-speaking residents that had migrated to Quebec from the other colonies.

At the time of the letter&#x27;s writing, the Congress was already aware that Governor Carleton had called the people to arm themselves to defend their new King from the invasion. The letter warned the population of the danger of being sent to fight against France were it to join the war on the side of the Americans (which it eventually did in 1778). If the Congress insisted again on treating the Canadians as friends sharing common interests with the other colonists, it however warned the people not to &quot;reduce us the disagreeable necessity of treating you as enemies.&quot;

===Distribution and reaction to the second letter===
Price took the letter to Montreal, along with a similar letter from the New York Provincial Congress, and circulated them in the province. Much of the English-speaking merchant class, which was dependent on the fur trade and the market for it in Europe, was wary of the situation. The French &quot;habitants &quot;were generally unswayed by appeals to English liberties, with which they had relatively little familiarity. However, they were also not overly supportive of the existing military government, as calls to arms were met with limited success. The &quot;habitants&quot; much more opportunistically were happy to follow whichever force was winning at the time, as long as they paid for their supplies.

In the end, the Americans gained limited support in Quebec, ultimately raising two regiments that participated in the Continental Army. The 1st Canadian Regiment was raised in November 1775 during the early days of the invasion of Canada, and the 2nd Canadian Regiment was raised in January 1776.

==Third letter==
In September 1775, after the failure of the second letter to sway public opinion, the American Colonists launched an invasion of Quebec from Fort Ticonderoga and Cambridge, Massachusetts. This invasion culminated in the Battle of Quebec at the end of December 1775, in which the city was successfully defended, and the invaders dug in for the winter. Following the battle, Moses Hazen and Edward Antill traveled from Quebec to Philadelphia to bring the news of the American defeat.

===Drafting the third letter===
After hearing of the defeat, the Congress, on January 23, 1776, set up a committee to which was entrusted the drafting of another letter to the Canadian population. The members of the committee this time were William Livingston, Thomas Lynch Jr, and James Wilson. The letter was approved the day after, and signed by John Hancock.

===Contents===
The Congress thanked the population for the services it rendered to its cause and ensured them that troops to protect them were on the way, and would arrive before British reinforcements. It also informed them that the Congress had authorized the raising of two battalions in Canada to assist in the cause. The people were once again invited to organize local and provincial assemblies, which could choose delegates to represent the province in the Continental Congress.

===Distribution and reaction to the third letter===
The French translation was again printed by Fleury Mesplet; however, it is not certain who in the committee is the author and also if du Simitière was the translator. Hazen and Antill delivered copies of the letter to David Wooster, commanding the colonial forces occupying Montreal. He oversaw distribution of the letter at the end of February.

The letter met with no significant response, as the populace was unhappy about being paid for supplies in paper currency, and was otherwise not enamored of the occupation by the colonial forces.

==Conclusion==
The 1775 American invasion was a disastrous failure, with the Americans forced to retreat back to Fort Ticonderoga. The province remained in British hands, and its population centers were never threatened again in the war. The goal of these letters, and a variety of other addresses to the Canadian people, to gain political and military support for the revolution were generally not realized. While the Congress succeeded in raising two regiments of Canadians (James Livingston&#x27;s 1st Canadian Regiment and Hazen&#x27;s 2nd Canadian Regiment), their numbers were not as large as desired, and the &quot;seigneurs&quot; and the Catholic clergy ultimately rallied around the British governor. Quebec would remain a relatively strong colony for Britain due in large part to the strict leadership of Guy Carleton, and despite attempts to bring the revolutionary spirit of the American colonies into Quebec.

<text>Mr. Harold Hooper (played by Will Lee) was one of the first four human characters to appear on the television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Created by producer and writer Jon Stone, Mr. Hooper is the original proprietor of Hooper&#x27;s Store, the neighborhood variety store and combination diner/corner store that serves as a place for Muppets and humans to meet and interact. Lee, a character actor and instructor was &quot;perfectly cast&quot; as Mr. Hooper. Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers. Mr. Hooper, who has been described as &quot;slightly cranky but good-hearted&quot; and &quot;curmudgeonly&quot;, bridges the gap between the older generation and its young audience. Hooper&#x27;s Store, &quot;an idealized social institution&quot;, is an extension of his personality. He had a close relationship with the Muppet Big Bird. 

After Lee&#x27;s death on December 7, 1982, instead of recasting the role, or explaining his departure by saying he had moved, quit or retired, the writers and producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; decided to have the character of Mr. Hooper die. Then, they created a TV episode to teach their young audience about the difficult topic of death. Research was conducted to ascertain the messages they wanted to convey about the topic, as well as the effect the episode would have on the young children who watched it. They were advised by experts in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. Studies conducted after the episode was produced showed that most children understood its messages about death, and that they experienced no long-term ill effects.

The episode, written by head writer Norman Stiles, aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983. The cast and crew reported that filming it was an emotional and touching experience, with Bob McGrath listing it as one of his two favorites. Setting the standard for dealing with difficult topics on children&#x27;s television, the show was called heartbreaking yet affirming, and remains one of the proudest moments in the show&#x27;s history.

==Development and description==
Mr. Hooper, played by Will Lee from the premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1969 until his death in 1982, was one of the first four human characters that appeared on the show. Created by producer and writer Jon Stone, the role of Mr. Hooper was the first to be cast. Lee came to Stone&#x27;s attention through writers Bruce Hart and Carole Hart. Mr. Hooper was inspired by the Bob Keeshan character Captain Kangaroo; Stone previously worked on the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; program, which greatly influenced him as he developed &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Mr. Hooper is the original proprietor of Hooper&#x27;s Store, the neighborhood variety store and combination diner/corner store that serves as a place for Muppets and humans to meet and interact. Stone&#x27;s original conception of Mr. Hooper was that he would be, like most owners of such establishments at the time, older, male, and Jewish.

Lee was a character actor and acting instructor with a range of roles in the theater. Lee had been blacklisted from many mainstream acting roles for about five years during the McCarthy era, for refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee&#x27;s investigation of Communist influence in show business. According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and horn-rimmed glasses, &quot;with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief&quot;. Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was &quot;perfectly cast&quot; as Mr. Hooper. According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s first episode with Lee, &quot;Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did ... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it&quot;. Joan Ganz Cooney, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; co-creator and president of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW), said, &quot;He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.

Davis described Mr. Hooper as &quot;slightly cranky but good-hearted&quot;. Gikow called Mr. Hooper &quot;curmudgeonly&quot;. Davis stated that since Mr. Hooper&#x27;s appearance in the first episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, he had become many things to many young children, &quot;... the guy in the apron at the far side of the generation gap, his half-lens glasses slipping down his nose&quot;. Davis also stated that Hooper&#x27;s Store, which he called &quot;an idealized social institution&quot;, is an extension of Mr. Hooper&#x27;s personality. Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird, who would often come into Hooper&#x27;s Store for a birdseed milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper&#x27;s name, although most attempts ended in &quot;ooper&quot;, such as &quot;Looper&quot; or &quot;Cooper&quot;. Mr. Hooper&#x27;s first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.

Mr. Hooper&#x27;s last appearances on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; aired in 1983, but Lee&#x27;s last segments for the show were taped in November 1982. Lee participated in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade with other &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters a few days before he died of a heart attack on December 7, 1982.

==Death of Mr. Hooper==
When Will Lee died on December 7, 1982, instead of recasting the role for the character (replacing Will Lee with a new actor so Mr. Hooper could still be in the show), explaining Mr. Hooper&#x27;s departure (by saying that he had retired and/or moved away), or simply dropping him from the show without explanation, the producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; decided to have the character pass away as well. Then they used the episode to teach their young audience about the difficult topic of death. According to CTW researcher Rosemarie Truglio and her colleagues, the episode was one of the many social issues relevant to preschoolers the show has dealt with throughout its history. Executive producer Dulcy Singer reported that they followed their instincts to be &quot;honest and straightforward&quot; and to &quot;deal with it head-on&quot;.

===Synopsis===
The &quot;Sesame Street&quot; episode (#1839) in which the death of Mr. Hooper was discussed, was structured as all episodes were structured at the time, with individual segments that took place on the main brownstone set interrupted by inserts, or puppet skits, short films, and animations. The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy; as Davis states, &quot;Later, Big Bird forgets something that makes him sad&quot;. After several inserts, Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, he answers, &quot;Just because&quot;. Later, Big Bird listens to the adults talking about a new baby who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother.

Two segments later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado), and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing politics by giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper&#x27;s picture, saying that he will give it to him when he returns. The human characters explain the irreversibility of death to Big Bird, who reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him. David reveals that he will take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will, and that he is going to serve milkshakes to Big Bird, like Mr. Hooper used to do. Big Bird asks, &quot;Why does it have to be this way? Give me one good reason!&quot; and after a long silence Gordon answers, &quot;Big Bird, it has to be this way... because.&quot; Looking at Mr. Hooper&#x27;s picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, &quot;I&#x27;m going to miss you, Mr. Looper.&quot; Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him, hugging him in support.

The episode ends with Big Bird hanging Mr. Hooper&#x27;s picture near his nest. Luis knocks on his door to introduce the new baby, followed by the entire grown-up cast. Big Bird says, &quot;You know what the nice thing is about new babies? One day they&#x27;re not here, and the next day, here they are!&quot; The cast collectively show affection to the baby as the show closes.

===Research===
Similar to what they had done with other social issues and in developing their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it. The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. The team advised the show&#x27;s writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called &quot;a curriculum bath&quot;; Bernstein described it in this way: &quot;We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they&#x27;ve heard&quot;. The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper&#x27;s death. They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children&#x27;s fears about death. They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: &quot;Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all&quot;. Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers&#x27; skills as educators as well as entertainers.

Before the episode aired, the CTW conducted a series of studies to guide the writers and producers in creating the episode. Their goal was to answer four key questions: (1) Will children understand the messages they wanted to convey about death? (2) How attentive will they be to the storyline? (3) How will parents respond to the treatment of such a sensitive topic? and (4) Will children be disturbed by the messages, and if so, for how long? The researchers broke up children into three groups: children who only watched the scenes in which the storyline was played out and who were interviewed afterwards; children who watched the entire episode and whose attention was recorded while they viewed it; and children who watched the episode without the inserts, with their parents, who were interviewed 9 or 10 days later.

The researchers found that 73% of 4- and 5-year-olds in their study understood that Mr. Hooper was dead and that 88% of this group understood that he was not coming back, although only about one-fourth of the 3-year-old viewers responded correctly. Most of the 4- and 5-year-olds understood that Big Bird and the adults were sad. Most children (80%) were attentive during the episode. The parents interviewed had &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; reactions to the show, and that half reported that they had discussed death with their children after viewing it. None of the parents reported negative reactions from their children, either immediately after watching the episode or at a later time.

===Development and legacy===
&quot;Sesame Street&quot; head writer Norman Stiles was chosen to write the segments about Mr. Hooper&#x27;s death. The episode focused on the life cycle of birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. Stiles said, &quot;We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay&quot;. Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; tell Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, &quot;Just because&quot;. The show&#x27;s outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is &quot;never a good explanation&quot; about why people die.

The episode aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983, a year after Lee&#x27;s final appearance as Mr. Hooper at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day parade. The producers chose to air it the first week of the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper&#x27;s absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. Mr. Hooper&#x27;s picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, &quot;When we finished that scene there wasn&#x27;t one of us whose face wasn&#x27;t streaked with tears&quot;, even Spinney underneath his costume. Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, &quot;There was nothing wrong with that take. It was perfect.&quot; Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance.

A book, entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Miss You, Mr. Hooper&quot; and based upon the script for the episode, was published in 1984. The book was also written by Stiles. According to Renée Cherow-O&#x27;Leary, Stiles and the editorial staff of the CTW&#x27;s book division worked with the show&#x27;s research staff and used the same educational content information and research the show&#x27;s producers used to create the episode.

<text>Hans-Rudolf Merz (born 10 November 1942) is a Swiss politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2004 to 2010. A member of the Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD) until the foundation of FDP.The Liberals in 2009, he headed the Federal Department of Finance during his tenure as a Federal Councillor. Merz served as President of the Swiss Confederation in 2009.

==Biography==
===Education===
Born in Herisau in the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, he studied at Hochschule St. Gallen and graduated in 1971 with a DEA&#x27;s degree. Merz was a Scout and visited the National Jamboree of Switzerland in July 2008. He is married and a father of three sons.

===Early political career===
From 1969 to 1974, he was party secretary of the Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD) in St. Gallen. From 1974 to 1977 he worked as vice president for UBS&#x27;s Wolfsberg formation centre in Ermatingen. Since then he has worked as a management consultant. In 1997 he was elected to the Swiss Council of States for the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden. He presided over the finance committee and was a member of the foreign policy committee.

===Swiss Federal Council===
Merz was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 10 December 2003 and took office on 1 January 2004. At the time he was on the board of directors of the Helvetia-Patria insurance company and Anova Holding. He was also a member of the board of trustees of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation.
On 20 September 2008, whilst in Eastern Switzerland, Merz was rushed to hospital, having suffered from a heart attack. He was soon flown to Bern University Hospital, where he had a multiple bypass operation. He was also placed into an artificial coma. This led to a reorganisation of the cabinet and the absence of President Pascal Couchepin from the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. On 10 December 2008, as the Member of the Federal Council that had not been its president for the longest time, Merz was elected President of the Confederation for 2009. In the Federal Assembly, the 66-year-old received 185 out of 209 valid votes. He succeeded Free Democratic Party colleague Pascal Couchepin. Doris Leuthard was elected as Vice President of the Confederation, succeeding Merz.

On 20 September 2010, a recording of Merz replying to a question about meat imports in the Federal Assembly became a viral video, drawing international attention. Merz convulsed with laughter when speaking, later saying that he found the dense bureaucratic language of the reply drafted for him by customs officials amusing. He was attempting to provide information about whether the sales of Bündnerfleisch in Switzerland were endangered by meat imports.

<doc id="396639" wikidata="Q1784288" url="?curid=396639" title="Invisible Man">
<text>Invisible Man is Ralph Ellison&#x27;s first novel, and the only one published during his lifetime. It was published by Random House in 1952, and addresses many of the social and intellectual issues faced by African Americans in the early 20th century, including black nationalism, the relationship between black identity and Marxism, and the reformist racial policies of Booker T. Washington, as well as issues of individuality and personal identity.

&quot;Invisible Man&quot; won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1953, making Ellison the first African-American writer to win the award.
In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Invisible Man&quot; 19th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its 100 Best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005 list, calling it &quot;the quintessential American picaresque of the 20th century&quot;, rather than a &quot;race novel, or even a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;&quot;. Malcolm Bradbury and Richard Ruland recognize a black existentialist vision with a &quot;Kafka-like absurdity&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Barack Obama modeled his 1995 memoir &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot; on Ellison&#x27;s novel.

==Background==
Ellison says in his introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition that he started to write what would eventually become &quot;Invisible Man&quot; in a barn in Waitsfield, Vermont (actually in the neighboring town of Fayston), in the summer of 1945 while on sick leave from the Merchant Marine. The book took five years to complete with one year off for what Ellison termed an &quot;ill-conceived short novel&quot;. &quot;Invisible Man&quot; was published as a whole in 1952. Ellison had published a section of the book in 1947, the famous &quot;Battle Royal&quot; scene, which had been shown to Cyril Connolly, the editor of &quot;Horizon&quot; magazine by Frank Taylor, one of Ellison&#x27;s early supporters.

In his speech accepting the 1953 National Book Award, Ellison said that he considered the novel&#x27;s chief significance to be its &quot;experimental attitude.&quot; Before &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, many (if not most) novels dealing with African Americans were written solely for social protest, notably, &quot;Native Son&quot; and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The narrator in &quot;Invisible Man&quot; says, &quot;I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either&quot;, signaling a break from the usual protest novel. In the essay &quot;The World and the Jug,&quot; a response to Irving Howe&#x27;s essay &quot;Black Boys and Native Sons&quot; which &quot;pit[s] Ellison and [James] Baldwin against [Richard] Wright and then&quot;, as Ellison would say, &quot;gives Wright the better argument,&quot; Ellison makes a fuller statement about the position he held about his book in the larger canon of work by an American who happens to be of African ancestry. In the opening paragraph to that essay Ellison poses three questions: &quot;Why is it so often true that when critics confront the American as Negro they suddenly drop their advanced critical armament and revert with an air of confident superiority to quite primitive modes of analysis? Why is it that Sociology-oriented critics seem to rate literature so far below politics and ideology that they would rather kill a novel than modify their presumptions concerning a given reality which it seeks in its own terms to project? Finally, why is it that so many of those who would tell us the meaning of Negro life never bother to learn how varied it really is?&quot;

Placing &quot;Invisible Man&quot; within the canon of either the Harlem Renaissance or the Black Arts Movement is difficult. It owes allegiance to both and neither. Ellison&#x27;s resistance to being pigeonholed by his peers bubbled over into his statement to Irving Howe about what he deemed to be a relative vs. an ancestor. He says to Howe &quot;...perhaps you will understand when I say that he [Wright] did not influence me if I point out that while one can do nothing about choosing one&#x27;s relatives, one can, as an artist, choose one&#x27;s &#x27;ancestors&#x27;. Wright was, in this sense, a &#x27;relative&#x27;; Hemingway an &#x27;ancestor&#x27;.&quot; It was this idea of &quot;playing the field,&quot; so to speak, not being &quot;all-in&quot;, that led to some of Ellison&#x27;s more staunch critics. Howe, in &quot;Black Boys and Native Sons&quot;, but also other black writers such as John Oliver Killens, who once denounced &quot;Invisible Man&quot; by saying: &quot;The Negro people need Ralph Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Man&quot; like we need a hole in the head or a stab in the back. ... It is a vicious distortion of Negro life.&quot;
Ellison&#x27;s &quot;ancestors&quot; included, among others, T. S. Eliot. In an interview with Richard Kostelanetz, Ellison states that what he had learned from his &quot;The Waste Land&quot; was imagery and also improvisation techniques he had only before seen in jazz. Some other influences include William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. Ellison once called Faulkner the South&#x27;s greatest artist, and in the Spring 1955 &quot;Paris Review&quot;, Ellison said of Hemingway: &quot;I read him to learn his sentence structure and how to organize a story. I guess many young writers were doing this, but I also used his description of hunting when I went into the fields the next day. I had been hunting since I was eleven, but no one had broken down the process of wing-shooting for me, and it was from reading Hemingway that I learned to lead a bird. When he describes something in print, believe him; believe him even when he describes the process of art in terms of baseball or boxing; he’s been there.&quot;

Some of Ellison&#x27;s influences had a more direct impact on his novel. The first line of &quot;Invisible Man&quot; (&quot;I am an invisible man&quot;) for example, is a conscious echo of &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (&quot;I am a sick man&quot;). Ellison acknowledged this borrowing in his 1981 introduction to his novel saying the novel&#x27;s main character can be &quot;associated, ever so distantly, with the narrator of Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes From Underground&quot;&quot;.

Arnold Rampersad, Ellison&#x27;s biographer, says that Herman Melville had a profound influence on Ellison&#x27;s way of writing about race: the narrator &quot;resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;&quot;. Ellison signals his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service: &quot;Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the &#x27;Blackness of Blackness&#x27;. And the congregation answers: &#x27;That blackness is most black, brother, most black...&#x27;&quot; In this scene Ellison &quot;reprises a moment in the second chapter of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;&quot;, where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford looking for a place to spend the night and enters a black church: &quot;It was a negro church; and the preacher&#x27;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.&quot; According to Rampersad, it was Melville who &quot;empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition&quot; by his example of &quot;representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously&quot; in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

==Political influences and the Communist Party==
The letters he wrote to fellow novelist Richard Wright as he started working on the novel provide evidence for his disillusion with and defection from the Communist Party USA for perceived revisionism. In a letter to Wright on August 18, 1945, Ellison poured out his anger toward party leaders for betraying African-American and Marxist class politics during the war years: &quot;If they want to play ball with the bourgeoisie they needn&#x27;t think they can get away with it... Maybe we can&#x27;t smash the atom, but we can, with a few well-chosen, well-written words, smash all that crummy filth to hell.&quot; Ellison resisted attempts to ferret out such allusions in the book itself however, stating &quot;I did not want to describe an existing Socialist or Communist or Marxist political group, primarily because it would have allowed the reader to escape confronting certain political patterns, patterns which still exist and of which our two major political parties are guilty in their relationships to Negro Americans.&quot;

==Plot summary==
The narrator, an unnamed black man, begins by describing his living conditions: an underground room wired with hundreds of electric lights, operated by power stolen from the city&#x27;s electric grid. He reflects on the various ways in which he has experienced social invisibility during his life and begins to tell his story, returning to his teenage years.

The narrator lives in a small Southern town and, upon graduating from high school, wins a scholarship to an all-black college after taking part in a brutal, humiliating battle royal for the entertainment of the town&#x27;s rich white dignitaries.

One afternoon during his junior year at the college, the narrator chauffeurs Mr. Norton, a visiting rich white trustee, out among the old slave-quarters beyond the campus. By chance, he stops at the cabin of Jim Trueblood, who has caused a scandal by impregnating both his wife and his daughter in his sleep. Trueblood&#x27;s account horrifies Mr. Norton so badly that he asks the narrator to find him a drink. The narrator drives him to a bar filled with prostitutes and patients from a nearby mental hospital. The mental patients rail against both of them and eventually overwhelm the orderly assigned to keep the patients under control, injuring Mr. Norton in the process. The narrator hurries Mr. Norton away from the chaotic scene and back to campus.

Dr. Bledsoe, the college president, excoriates the narrator for showing Mr. Norton the underside of black life beyond the campus and expels him. However, Bledsoe gives several sealed letters of recommendation to the narrator, to be delivered to friends of the college in order to assist him in finding a job so that he may eventually earn enough to re-enroll. The narrator travels to New York and distributes his letters, with no success; the son of one recipient shows him the letter, which reveals Bledsoe&#x27;s intent never to admit the narrator as a student again.

Acting on the son&#x27;s suggestion, the narrator seeks work at the Liberty Paint factory, renowned for its pure white paint. He is assigned first to the shipping department, then to the boiler room, whose chief attendant, Lucius Brockway, is highly paranoid and suspects that the narrator is trying to take his job. This distrust worsens after the narrator stumbles into a union meeting, and Brockway attacks the narrator and tricks him into setting off an explosion in the boiler room. The narrator is hospitalized and subjected to shock treatment, overhearing the doctors&#x27; discussion of him as a possible mental patient.

After leaving the hospital, the narrator faints on the streets of Harlem and is taken in by Mary Rambo, a kindly old-fashioned woman who reminds him of his relatives in the South. He later happens across the eviction of an elderly black couple and makes an impassioned speech that incites the crowd to attack the law enforcement officials in charge of the proceedings. The narrator escapes over the rooftops and is confronted by Brother Jack, the leader of a group known as &quot;the Brotherhood&quot; that professes its commitment to bettering conditions in Harlem and the rest of the world. At Jack&#x27;s urging, the narrator agrees to join and speak at rallies to spread the word among the black community. Using his new salary, he pays Mary back the rent he owes her and moves into an apartment provided by the Brotherhood.

The rallies go smoothly at first, with the narrator receiving extensive indoctrination on the Brotherhood&#x27;s ideology and methods. Soon, though, he encounters trouble from Ras the Exhorter, a fanatical black nationalist who believes that the Brotherhood is controlled by whites. Neither the narrator nor Tod Clifton, a youth leader within the Brotherhood, is particularly swayed by his words. The narrator is later called before a meeting of the Brotherhood and accused of putting his own ambitions ahead of the group. He is reassigned to another part of the city to address issues concerning women, seduced by the wife of a Brotherhood member, and eventually called back to Harlem when Clifton is reported missing and the Brotherhood&#x27;s membership and influence begin to falter.

The narrator can find no trace of Clifton at first, but soon discovers him selling dancing Sambo dolls on the street, having become disillusioned with the Brotherhood. Clifton is shot and killed by a policeman while resisting arrest; at his funeral, the narrator delivers a rousing speech that rallies the crowd to support the Brotherhood again. At an emergency meeting, Jack and the other Brotherhood leaders criticize the narrator for his unscientific arguments and the narrator determines that the group has no real interest in the black community&#x27;s problems.

The narrator returns to Harlem, trailed by Ras&#x27;s men, and buys a hat and a pair of sunglasses to elude them. As a result, he is repeatedly mistaken for a man named Rinehart, known as a lover, a hipster, a gambler, a briber, and a spiritual leader. Understanding that Rinehart has adapted to white society at the cost of his own identity, the narrator resolves to undermine the Brotherhood by feeding them dishonest information concerning the Harlem membership and situation. After seducing the wife of one member in a fruitless attempt to learn their new activities, he discovers that riots have broken out in Harlem due to widespread unrest. He realizes that the Brotherhood has been counting on such an event in order to further its own aims. The narrator gets mixed up with a gang of looters, who burn down a tenement building, and wanders away from them to find Ras, now on horseback, armed with a spear and shield, and calling himself &quot;the Destroyer&quot;. Ras shouts for the crowd to lynch the narrator, but the narrator attacks him with the spear and escapes into an underground coal bin. Two white men seal him in, leaving him alone to ponder the racism he has experienced in his life.

The epilogue returns to the present, with the narrator stating that he is ready to return to the world because he has spent enough time hiding from it. He explains that he has told his story in order to help people see past his own invisibility, and also to provide a voice for people with a similar plight: &quot;Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?&quot;

== Reception ==
Critic Orville Prescott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the novel &quot;the most impressive work of fiction by an American Negro which I have ever read&quot;, and felt it marked &quot;the appearance of a richly talented writer&quot;. Novelist Saul Bellow in his review found it &quot;a book of the very first order, a superb book...it is tragi-comic, poetic, the tone of the very strongest sort of creative intelligence&quot;. George Mayberry of &quot;The New Republic&quot; said Ellison &quot;is a master at catching the shape, flavor and sound of the common vagaries of human character and experience&quot;.

Anthony Burgess described the novel as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;.

In 2003, a sculpture titled &quot;Invisible Man: A Memorial to Ralph Ellison&quot; by Elizabeth Catlett, was unveiled at Riverside Park at 150th Street in Manhattan, opposite from where Ellison lived and three blocks from the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum, where he is interred in a crypt. The 15-foot-high, 10-foot-wide bronze monolith features a hollow silhouette of a man and two granite panels that are inscribed with Ellison quotations.

==Adaptation==
It was reported in October 2017 that streaming service Hulu was developing the novel into a television series.

<text>Sir Martin Ryle (27 September 1918 – 14 October 1984) was an English radio astronomer who developed revolutionary radio telescope systems (see e.g. aperture synthesis) and used them for accurate location and imaging of weak radio sources. In 1946 Ryle and Derek Vonberg were the first people to publish interferometric astronomical measurements at radio wavelengths. With improved equipment, Ryle observed the most distant known galaxies in the universe at that time. He was the first Professor of Radio Astronomy in the University of Cambridge and founding director of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory. He was the twelfth Astronomer Royal from 1972 to 1982. Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent.

==Education and early life==
Martin Ryle was born in Brighton, England, the son of Professor John Alfred Ryle and Miriam (née Scully) Ryle. He was the nephew of Oxford University Professor of Philosophy Gilbert Ryle. After studying at Bradfield College, Ryle studied physics at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1939, Ryle worked with the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) on the design of antennas for airborne radar equipment during World War II. After the war, he received a fellowship at the Cavendish Laboratory.

==Career and research==
The focus of Ryle&#x27;s early work in Cambridge was on radio waves from the Sun. His interest quickly shifted to other areas, however, and he decided early on that the Cambridge group should develop new observing techniques. As a result, Ryle was the driving force in the creation and improvement of astronomical interferometry and aperture synthesis, which paved the way for massive upgrades in the quality of radio astronomical data. In 1946 Ryle built the first multi-element astronomical radio interferometer.

Ryle guided the Cambridge radio astronomy group in the production of several important radio source catalogues. One such catalogue, the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) in 1959 helped lead to the discovery of the first quasi-stellar object (quasar).

While serving as university lecturer in physics at Cambridge from 1948 to 1959, Ryle became director of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1957 and professor of radio astronomy in 1959. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952, was knighted in 1966 (p 519 of) and succeeded Sir Richard Woolley as Astronomer Royal from 1972 to 1982. Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. In 1968 Ryle served as professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London.

===Personality===
According to numerous reports Ryle was quick-thinking, impatient with those slower than himself and charismatic (pp 502, 508, 510 of). He was also idealistic (p 519 of), a characteristic he shared with his father (p 499 of,). In an interview (p271 of) in 1982 he said &quot;At times one feels that one should almost have a car sticker saying &#x27;Stop Science Now&#x27; because we&#x27;re getting cleverer and cleverer, but we do not increase the wisdom to go with it.&quot;

He was also intense and volatile (p 327 of), the latter characteristic being associated with his mother (p 499 of, Folder A.20 of). The historian Owen Chadwick described him as &quot;a &quot;rare&quot; personality, of exceptional sensitivity of mind, fears and anxieties, care and compassion, humour and anger.&quot; (Folder A.28 of)

Ryle was sometimes considered difficult to work with – he often worked in an office at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory to avoid disturbances from other members of the Cavendish Laboratory and to avoid getting into heated arguments, as Ryle had a hot temper. Ryle worried that Cambridge would lose its standing in the radio astronomy community as other radio astronomy groups had much better funding, so he encouraged a certain amount of secrecy about his aperture synthesis methods in order to keep an advantage for the Cambridge group. Ryle had heated arguments with Fred Hoyle of the Institute of Astronomy about Hoyle&#x27;s steady state universe, which restricted collaboration between the Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group and the Institute of Astronomy during the 1960s.
=== War, peace and energy ===
Ryle was a new physics graduate and an experienced radio ham in 1939, when the Second World War started. He played an important part in the Allied war effort, working mainly in radar countermeasures. After the war, &quot;He returned to Cambridge with a determination to devote himself to pure science, unalloyed by the taint of war.&quot;

In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent. With publications from 1976 and continuing, despite illness until he died in 1984, he pursued a passionate and intensive program on the socially responsible use of science and technology. His main themes were:
* Warning the world of the horrific dangers of nuclear armaments, notably in his pamphlet &quot;Towards the Nuclear Holocaust&quot;.
* Criticism of nuclear power, as in &quot;Is there a case for nuclear power?&quot;
* Research and promotion of alternative energy and energy efficiency, as in &quot;Short-term Storage and Wind Power Availability&quot;.
* Calling for the responsible use of science and technology. &quot;...we should strive to see how the vast resources now diverted towards the destruction of life are turned instead to the solution of the problems which both rich - but especially the poor - countries of the world now face.&quot;

In 1983 Ryle responded to a request from the President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences for suggestions of topics to be discussed at a meeting on &quot;Science and Peace&quot;. Ryle&#x27;s reply was published posthumously in &quot;Martin Ryle&#x27;s Letter&quot;. An abridged version appears in &quot;New Scientist&quot; with the title &quot;Martin Ryle&#x27;s Last Testament&quot;. The letter ends with &quot;Our cleverness has grown prodigiously – but not our wisdom.&quot;

===Honours and awards===
Ryle was awarded numerous prizes and honours including:

* Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952
*Hughes Medal (1954)
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1964)
*Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize (1965)
*Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences (1965)
*Albert A. Michelson Medal of the Franklin Institute (1971)
*Royal Medal (1973)
*Bruce Medal (1974)
*Nobel Prize in Physics (1974)
*Ryle Telescope at Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory
* In 1965 Ryle co-delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;Exploration of the Universe&quot;.
==Personal life==
In their early years Ryle and his elder brother received lessons at home in carpentry (p 498 of ) and manual skills became important for him throughout his life. This was for relaxation – he built boats to his own designs (p 498 of ) – and professionally. In his wartime radar work (), his post-war radio-telescope building (p 510 of ) and his late researches into wind energy (p 517 of ) he was a hands-on practical engineer as well as a scientist.

Ryle also had a lifelong interest in sailing (p 498 of) and this matched his choice when in the 1970s he turned his research subject from astronomy to wind energy (pp 420–422 of)

Another practical skill acquired by Ryle in his youth that later served him well in his professional career was as a radio &#x27;ham&#x27;. While still at School (Bradfield College) he built his own transmitter and obtained a Post Office licence to operate it (pp 498–499 of), with the GB-Callsign G3CY.

In 1936 the family moved to a house in Cambridge which became Ryle&#x27;s home after the war. In 1947 he and Rowena Palmer married, and they lived in this house for rest of his life. They had three children, born in 1949, 1951 and 1952. Ryle died on 14 October 1984, in Cambridge. He was celebrated on a first class stamp issued in 2009 as part of an Eminent Britons set. Lady Rowena Ryle died in 2013.

<text>Chikchikam Lupatkue-latko ( – December 3, 1896), known as Scarface Charley, was a chief of the Modoc tribe of Native Americans. He took part in the Modoc War of 1872–1873 in California, and is considered to have fired the first shot at the Battle of Lost River. On April 26, 1873, Scarfaced Charley led a victorious attack against a patrol of 63 soldiers. He killed all five of the officers in the patrol, as well as twenty others. It is widely written that he stopped the slaughter and told the soldiers, &quot;We&#x27;ve killed enough of you, now go home.&quot;

After the execution of Kintpuash and three of his warriors for the murder of Major General Edward Canby and Rev. Eleazar Thomas, Scarface Charley was appointed by Colonel Frank Wheaton as chief of the Modocs who were to be sent to Oklahoma. After a year in Oklahoma, Scarfaced Charley was replaced by Indian Agent Hiram Jones, as chief by Bogus Charley, partly due to the latter&#x27;s better understanding of English. Other accounts hold that he was removed because he refused to accept that white people were &quot;true rulers&quot;.

Scarfaced Charley was also a gifted craftsman, designing an elegant typeface for the phonetic transcription of the Modoc language. He also developed a line of traditionally influenced domestic furniture, which was an important source of revenue for him after his political career was ended.

<doc id="396647" wikidata="Q850532" url="?curid=396647" title="Betuweroute">
<text>The Betuweroute is a double track freight railway between Rotterdam and Germany. is the official name, after the Betuwe area through which the route passes. The line is popularly called Betuwelijn, after an older local rail line in the same region. The line extends into Germany as the Oberhausen–Arnhem railway, and it is part of Project 5 of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T).

==History==

In 1985 the Van Bonde Commission began to investigate the future of west–east transport. The main advocate of the proposed line was the then minister Neelie Kroes, later Commissioner in the European Union until 2014. In 1992 the German and Dutch governments signed the Treaty of Warnemünde, which addressed enhancing rail traffic and focused on the tracks from Amsterdam and Rotterdam to Duisburg. The original plan was for three branch rail lines towards Germany. The northern branch via Oldenzaal was abandoned in 1999 and the southern branch via Venlo was abandoned in 2004. Also in 2004, the courts forbade the construction of a large logistics centre near Valburg.

In 1988 the Dutch state-owned passenger railway company NS began work on the line. Delayed by two years, the railway was finished mid-2007. The final cost was 4.7 billion euros, more than twice the original budget of 2.3 billion euros, and more than quadruple the initial estimate from 1990 of 1.1 billion euros.

The large and rising costs, and criticism about government funding, promoted the government to seek private financing for the line, without success. On 16 June 2007, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands presided over the opening ceremony for the line that connects Rotterdam to the German border. Despite the TEN-T and bilateral agreements, Germany did not expect to complete reconstruction of their lines that connect with Betuweroute before 2015.

== Route ==
The route is a direct line from the Maasvlakte to Zevenaar, connecting the Port of Rotterdam to Germany.

Compared with the previous rail route between Barendrecht and Elst the main deviations are:
* Line now north of Zwijndrecht and Papendrecht
* Line now north of Gorinchem and south of Leerdam
* Line now north of Tiel
* From the south side of Elst the line runs straight to Zevenaar

The most striking infrastructure that was built or reconstructed as part of the Betuweroute includes:
* Container terminals in Rotterdam, Rail Service Centre Maasvlakte, Rail Service Centre Waalhaven, and Maasvlakte 2.
* The long Botlekspoortunnel under Rotterdam harbour replaces the antiquated Botlek bridge. The bridge remains in service as backup and for regional traffic. Space around the tunnel was so constrained that after completing the first tube, the tunnel boring machine had to be dismantled inside the tube. The parts were then returned to the starting point and reassembled to bore the second tube.
* The classification yard Kijfhoek between Barendrecht and Zwijndrecht was reconstructed.
* Barendrecht railway station has 9 tracks in a long structure. Much of the structure is covered with a layer of earth, to reduce noise. On top is a new city park. At the station itself, 4 of the tracks and their platforms have a glass roof. Nearby tracks cross on two levels.
* Tunnel were built under Pannerdensch Kanaal near Angeren. Instead of the projected bridge, a tunnel was bored, to protect the landscape and environment. The tunnel entrances were designed to blend in with the landscape. The tunnel itself has large lockable doors at each end, to prevent a flood on one side of the canal inundating the region on the opposite bank. Because two endangered animal species were found in the vicinity of the tunnel, a new habitat was laid out for the Great crested newt and the Natterjack Toad, as this video shows.

== Specifications and features ==
* The route is electrified at 25 kV AC and signaled using the ERTMS2 standard and AF Track Circuits. Electrification meets new European standards, but Dutch locomotives could not use the line&#x27;s power because they run on a different voltage. The German extension of the route does not comply with the new ERTMS2 standards, and also uses another voltage, thus limiting usability of the track. Custom-made locomotives were needed. The first new-spec locomotive was delivered to Railion in December 2007.
* Tunnels, viaducts and other parts of the railway are engineered to be 4.0 m wide and 6.15 m high in order to allow double stacked container trains under overhead wires, although no such trains will be in use on this route for years to come. The overhead wires were installed at standard height, to accommodate locomotives with standard pantographs. This and viaducts on the connecting lines prevent use of double-stacked containers. In the future, the overhead electrification wires could be raised to allow for double stacking without much effort or cost.
* For the section from Rotterdam to the large Kijfhoek classification yard, existing track was reconstructed. New construction occurred from Kijfhoek to Zevenaar near the German border, which is most of the remaining three quarters of the line.
* The total length of noise insulation panels on both sides of the track is , the same as the route length.
* Roll bars along the track keep derailed cars from toppling.
* 5 tunnels and several roofed sections add up to a length of .
* There are 190 passages to allow wildlife to cross.
* There are no level crossings, but instead 130 bridges and viaducts.
* Once the German line signaling and other infrastructure are updated, the Betuweroute&#x27;s capacity will be 10 trains per hour in each direction.

== Use ==
When the line opened, project managers hoped within five years to reach a daily average of 150 freight trains. In the first six months of operation, the unfinished German connection and problems with safety equipment caused traffic to be light. Usage increased steeply over the years 2008–2011. By mid-2011, 78% of all freight trains between Rotterdam and the German border took the Betuweroute. The other freight trains travelled via either Venlo or the border at Bad Bentheim, or used the conventional railway through Arnhem to Emmerich am Rhein Beginning in 2009, the heaviest trains in Germany and the Netherlands, 6,000 tonne trains, transported iron ore between the port of Rotterdam and Dillingen in Germany using the Betuweroute. As of 2019, the Betuweroute carried 4.2 billion ton-kilometers of cargo and 2.3 million train kilometers.

Unlike other Dutch rail network tariffs, the tariff charged to train operators to use the Betuwe rail line is not calculated by train weight but by the distance the train travels. Between 2008 and 2011 the tariff has increased progressively from €1.41 per train kilometer to €2.33 per train kilometer.

== Controversy ==
Many Dutch people, experts and politicians such as members of parliament opposed construction of the Betuweroute. The Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management received 14,000 complaints against the northern branch alone, which was cancelled in 1999. &quot;GroenFront!&quot; (Green Front), one among dozens of activist groups, was responsible for 35 confrontations in 1999–2001. University professors and official institutions heavily criticised the role of the government and ministers in relation to Betuweroute.

The main concerns about the Betuweroute were:
* Cost - Even at the original budget of 2.3 billion euros, there was much discussion about economic viability. Initial hopes of attracting private investors turned out to be totally unfounded. In 2000 the Court of Audit convicted the government of having issued unrealistic forecasts about cost, environmental effects and usage of the Betuweroute, as well as insufficient cost control. They stated that promoting river transport should have been considered as a realistic alternative. In 2004 the Centraal Planbureau (Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis), concluded that construction of the line would never pay for itself.
* Landscape - The line passes through the Groene Hart (Green Heart) of the Randstad and the Betuwe. There were concerns the rail line would damage both regions. The Groene Hart is a more or less rural area amid the Netherlands&#x27; largest cities. The Betuwe is a less densely populated green region along the major Dutch rivers. Both feature classic Dutch polder landscapes. Opposition to the original plans forced the construction of additional tunnels, which further increased the construction budget.
* Environmental issues - Many environmentalists and neighbours fiercely resisted the new line due to concerns about noise, dangerous chemical spills and the fragmentation of animal habitats. In response, extra noise insulation panels, tunnels and wildlife passages were built.
* Alternatives - As the Court of Audit concluded in its 2000 report, river transport was and still is a realistic alternative. River transport is cheaper, more flexible, safer and not much slower. The Dutch barge fleet is the largest and among the most modern in Europe, capable of transporting freight to the German industrial heartland with minimal government investment. Major Dutch rivers including Merwede, Waal and parts of the Rhine, Maas (Meuse), IJssel and Lek run roughly alongside the Betuweroute. Likewise, the A15, an excellent albeit congested highway, parallels the railway for .

<text>This article lists political parties in Guatemala. 
Guatemala has a multi-party system, with two or three strong political parties and other parties that are electorally successful. According to law if a party fails to get 4% of the vote or at least one deputy in Congress, the party is canceled.

<doc id="396655" wikidata="Q6634204" url="?curid=396655" title="List of political parties in Hong Kong">
<text>Hong Kong has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party was allowed to gain power by controlling the Legislative Council. The Chief Executive is appointed by the Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China based on an indirectly elected Election Committee and is &quot;de facto&quot; pro-Beijing but &quot;de jure&quot; is said to be nonpartisan as specified in the Chief Executive Election Ordinance. Once selected, the Chief Executive forms an unelected government which superficially has to rely on political parties in the legislature for support, but the legislature has been deliberately designed and redesigned to be a pro-Beijing rubber stamp body.

Hong Kong has no legislation for political parties; thus, it has no legal definition for what a political party is. Most political parties and political groups registered either as limited companies or societies.

In Hong Kong, there were two main political ideological blocs, which presents to pro-democracy camp (include localists) and pro-Beijing camp. Under the newly introduced electoral system since 2021, only government-approved candidates may run, effectively disqualifying any candidates who are not from the pro-Beijing camp or approved by Beijing. Most of the pro-democracy camp Legislative Councillors from the previous LegCo have been jailed by the Hong Kong government and are therefore disqualified from participating in elections without the need for government vetting.

<text>Ben Roy Mottelson (9 July 1926 – 13 May 2022) was an American-Danish nuclear physicist. He won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the non-spherical geometry of atomic nuclei.

==Early life==
Mottelson was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 9 July 1926, the son of Georgia (Blum) and Goodman Mottelson, an engineer. His family was Jewish. After graduating from Lyons Township High School in La Grange, Illinois, he joined the United States Navy and was sent to attend officers training at Purdue University, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1947. He then earned a PhD in nuclear physics from Harvard University in 1950. His thesis adviser was Julian Schwinger, the theoretical physicist who later won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his work on quantum electrodynamics.

==Career==
He moved to Institute for Theoretical Physics (later the Niels Bohr Institute) at the University of Copenhagen on the Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard, and remained in Denmark. In 1953 he was appointed staff member in CERN&#x27;s Theoretical Study Group, which was based in Copenhagen, a position he held until he became professor at the newly formed Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (Nordita) in 1957. He was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 1959. In 1971 he became a naturalized Danish citizen.

In 1950–1951, James Rainwater and Aage Bohr had developed models of the atomic nucleus which began to take into account the behaviour of the individual nucleons. These models, which moved beyond the simpler liquid drop treatment of the nucleus as having effectively no internal structure, were the first models which could explain a number of nuclear properties, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei. Mottelson worked with Aage Bohr to compare the theoretical models with experimental data. In 1952–1953, Bohr and Mottelson published a series of papers demonstrating close agreement between theory and experiment, for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum. This work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies.

In the summer of 1957, David Pines visited Copenhagen, and introduced Bohr and Mottelson to the pairing effect developed in theories of superconductivity, which inspired them to introduce a similar pairing effect to explain the differences in the energy levels between even and odd atomic nuclei.

===Nobel Prize (1975)===
Rainwater, Bohr and Mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection&quot;.

===Post–Nobel Prize work===
Bohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume monograph, &quot;Nuclear Structure&quot;. The first volume, &quot;Single-Particle Motion,&quot; appeared in 1969, and the second volume, &quot;Nuclear Deformations,&quot; in 1975.

Professor Mottelson was a member of the board of sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

He was an honorary member of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a foreign fellow of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 1969, he received the Atoms for Peace Award. He acted as director of ECT* (Trento, Italy) from 1993 to 1997.

==Personal life==
Mottelson was a dual citizen, as he held both Danish and American passports. He lived in Copenhagen. Mottelson was married to Nancy Jane Reno from 1948 until her death in 1975, and they had two sons and one daughter. Mottelson then married Britta Marger Siegumfeldt in 1983.

He died on 13 May 2022, in Copenhagen at the age of 95.

<text>The Mule Mountains are a north/south running mountain range located in the south-central area of Cochise County, Arizona. The highest peak, Mount Ballard, rises to . Prior to mining operations commencing there, the mountains were heavily forested with large Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii glauca&quot;) and other conifers, but these were all cut down for housing needs and to feed the ore smelting furnaces in Douglas, Arizona, approximately 20 miles due east. Now, the primary vegetation of the Mules consists of manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; spp.) brush, juniper, lowland oaks and pines, and various grasses. To the east of the mountain range lies Sulphur Springs Valley, and the San Pedro River and Valley to the west.

The terrain is very rough, with very steep slopes descending into deep canyons. Common wildlife species include desert mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus eremicus&quot;), Coues&#x27; White-tailed deer (&quot;O. virginianus couesi&quot;), Collared Peccary (&quot;Pecari tajacu&quot;) (locally known as javalinas), various types of rodents, lizards and a wide variety of birds. The upper ridges of the mountains consist primarily of a very hard brecciate limestone, and it is very common to find fossils of clams and snails imbedded in them.

Immediately to the east central area of the Mules lies the Lavender Pit, a large and very deep open pit copper mine dug and mined by the Phelps Dodge Corporation between 1951 through 1974. Over a billion tons of copper were extracted from the mine, along with significant quantities gold, silver and lead. Also, as a by-product of the mining operations, high quality turquoise (locally known as Bisbee Blue) was also discovered.

On the east central slope of the Mule Mountains can be found the Copper Queen Mine. In its days of production, (late 19th century – early 20th century) it was the richest copper deposit ever discovered, causing the accompanying town of Bisbee, Arizona to prosper. Under this part of the Mule Mountains are many mining tunnels dug in pursuit of the rich copper ore. Today, Bisbee (also known as the &quot;mile-high city,&quot; at elevation ) is largely a tourist town and retirement community along the slopes of Tombstone Canyon in the heart of the Mules. There are currently no organized mining operations in effect in the Mule Mountains. Much of the east/southeastern area of the range is private property.

<text>Leo James Rainwater (December 9, 1917 – May 31, 1986) was an American physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 for his part in determining the asymmetrical shapes of certain atomic nuclei.

During World War II, he worked on the Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr&#x27;s and Ben Mottelson&#x27;s experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.

Rainwater joined the physics faculty at Columbia in 1946, where he reached the rank of full professor in 1952 and was named Pupin Professor of Physics in 1982. He received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award for Physics in 1963 and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, &quot;for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection&quot;.

==Early life==
Leo James Rainwater was born on December 9, 1917, in Council, Idaho, the son of a former civil engineer who ran the local general store, Leo Jaspar Rainwater and his wife Edna Eliza née Teague. He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and Rainwater and his mother moved to Hanford, California, where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half-brother, George Fowler Jr., who became naval officer. At high school he excelled in mathematics, chemistry and physics and was admitted to the California Institute of Technology on the strength of a chemistry competition. He received his Bachelor of Science degree as a physics major in 1939.

==Manhattan Project==
Rainwater then chose to undertake postgraduate studies at Columbia University. At the time this was an unusual move for a scholar from California, as Columbia was not then renowned for its physics; but this had recently changed. George B. Pegram had recently built up the physics department, and hired scientists like Enrico Fermi. At Columbia Rainwater studied under Isidor Isaac Rabi, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller and John R. Dunning. Fermi was engaged in neutron moderator studies that would lead to the construction of the first nuclear reactor, while Dunning and Eugene T. Booth had built Columbia&#x27;s first cyclotron, in the basement of the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Rainwater received his Master of Arts in 1941. For his Doctor of Philosophy thesis on &quot;Neutron beam spectrometer studies of boron, cadmium, and the energy distribution from paraffin&quot;, written under Dunning&#x27;s supervision, he built a neutron spectrometer and developed techniques for its use. Rainwater married Emma Louise Smith in March 1942. They had three sons, James, Robert and William and a daughter, Elizabeth Ann, who died from leukaemia when she was nine.

Fermi&#x27;s reactor group moved to the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942. Rainwater remained at Columbia, where he joined the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The Manhattan Project was the Allied effort during World War II to develop atomic bombs. The SAM Laboratories&#x27; primary task was the development of gaseous diffusion technology for uranium enrichment, to produce fissile uranium-235 for use in atomic bombs. Rainwater worked with William W. Havens Jr. and Chien-Shiung Wu, mostly on studies of neutron cross sections, using the neutron spectrometer. After the war, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published. So too was his thesis, published in the Physical Review in two parts with Havens&#x27;s thesis, and he was awarded his doctorate in 1946. In 1963 he was awarded the United States Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, for his work on the Manhattan Project.

==Later life==
Rainwater remained at Columbia as an instructor. In 1948, he began teaching courses on nuclear structure. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had developed a theoretical treatment for nuclear fission in 1939 that they based on the liquid drop model of the nucleus. This was superseded in 1949 by Maria Goeppert Mayer&#x27;s nuclear shell model, which could explain more about the structure of heavy elements than the older theory but it still had limits. At a colloquium at Columbia in 1949, Charles H. Townes reported experimental results that indicated quadrupole moments greater than those indicated by the shell model. It occurred to Rainwater that this could be explained and the differences between the liquid drop and nuclear shell models could be reconciled, if the atomic nucleus were not spherical, as had been assumed but could assume other shapes. Rainwater published his theoretical paper in 1950. By chance, that year he was sharing an office with Aage Bohr, who took up the challenge of experimentally verifying Rainwater&#x27;s theory. Bohr and Ben Mottelson published their results in three papers in 1952 and 1953 that conclusively confirmed the theory. Rainwater felt that his model was overlooked. He later recalled that:

With funding from the Office of Naval Research, Rainwater built a synchrocyclotron, which became operational in 1950, at the Nevis Laboratories, on an estate on the Hudson River at Irvington, New York, willed to Columbia University by the DuPont family. He became a full professor in 1952 and was the director of Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961. He worked with his student Val Fitch on studies of muonic atoms, atoms where an electron is replaced by a muon. After 1965, he worked on turning the Nevis synchrocyclotron into a meson facility. When a reporter rang in 1975 to inform him that he had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his work on nuclear structure, the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson.

He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Institute of Physics, the American Association of Physics Teachers and the Optical Society of America.

Rainwater succeeded Robert R. Wilson as Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1983.

Rainwater collapsed after a lecture at the Pupin Laboratories in 1985 but was revived by a student who knew how to administer CPR. In declining health, he retired and became a professor emeritus in February 1986. He died from cardiopulmonary arrest at St. John&#x27;s Riverside Hospital in Yonkers, New York on May 31, 1986. He was survived by his wife, three sons and half-brother George.

<doc id="396675" wikidata="Q1515972" url="?curid=396675" title="Modoc people">
<text>The Modoc are an Indigenous American people who historically lived in the area which is now northeastern California and central Southern Oregon. Currently, they include two federally recognized tribes, the Klamath Tribes in Oregon and the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma, now known as the Modoc Nation.

==Language==
The Modoc, like the neighboring Klamath, spoke dialectic varieties of the Klamathan/Lutuamian language, a branch of the Plateau Penutian language family. Both peoples called themselves &quot;maklaks&quot;, meaning &quot;people&quot;. To distinguish between the tribes, the Modoc called themselves &quot;Moatokni maklaks&quot;, from &quot;muat&quot; meaning &quot;South&quot;. The Achomawi, a band of the Pit River tribe, called them &quot;Lutuami&quot;, meaning &quot;Lake Dwellers&quot;.

==Current population and geography==

About 600 Modoc live in Klamath County, Oregon, in and around their ancestral homelands. This group includes those who stayed on the reservation during the Modoc War, as well as the descendants of those who chose to return in 1909 to Oregon from Indian Territory in Oklahoma or Kansas. Since that time, many have followed the path of the Klamath. The shared tribal government of the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin in Oregon is known as the Klamath Tribes.

Two hundred Modoc live in Oklahoma on a small reservation in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, that the federal government purchased for them. Originally they were placed on the Quapaw Indian Reservation in Oklahoma&#x27;s far northeast corner. They are descendants of the band Captain Jack (Kintpuash) led during the Modoc War. The federal government officially recognized the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma in 1978, and its constitution was approved in 1991.

==Early population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. James Mooney put the aboriginal population of the Modoc at 400. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the Modoc population within California as 500 at the year 1770. University of Oregon anthropologist Theodore Stern suggested that there had been a total of about 500 Modoc. In 1846, the population may have included &quot;perhaps 600 warriors (an overestimate, probably)&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-contact===
Until the 19th century, when European explorers first encountered the Modoc, like all Plateau Indians, they caught salmon during salmon runs and migrated seasonally to hunt and gather other food. In winter, they built earthen dugout lodges shaped like beehives, covered with sticks and plastered with mud, near lake shores with reliable sources of seeds from aquatic wokas plants and fishing.

====Neighboring groups====
In addition to the Klamath, with whom they shared a language and the Modoc Plateau, the groups neighboring the Modoc home were:
*Shasta on the Klamath River;
*Rogue River Athabaskans and Takelma west over the Cascade Mountains;
*Northern Paiute east in the desert;
*Karuk and Yurok further down the Klamath River; and
*Achomawi or &quot;Pit River&quot; to the south, in the meadows of the Pit River drainages.

The Modoc, Northern Paiute, and Achomawi shared Goose Lake Valley.

====Settlements====
The known Modoc village sites are &quot;Agawesh,&quot; where Willow Creek enters Lower Klamath Lake, of the &quot;Gombatwa·s&quot; or Lower Klamath Lake People Band; &quot;Kumbat&quot; and &quot;Pashha&quot; on the shores of Tule Lake of the &quot;Pasganwa·s&quot; or Tule Lake People Band; and &quot;Wachamshwash&quot; and &quot;Nushalt-Hagak-ni&quot; on the Lost River of the &quot;Goġewa·s&quot; or Lower Lost River People Band. The Modoc have also been known as the Modok (Brandt and Davis-Kimball xvi).

===First contact===
In the 1820s, Peter Skene Ogden, an explorer for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, established trade with the Klamath people north of the Modoc.

===Applegate Trail established===
Brothers Jesse and Lindsay Applegate, accompanied by 13 other white settlers, established the Applegate Trail, or South Emigrant Trail, in 1846. It connected a point on the Oregon Trail near Fort Hall, Idaho, and the Willamette Valley in western Oregon. The new route was created to encourage European-Americans to come to western Oregon, and to eliminate the hazards encountered on the Columbia Route. Since the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company controlled the Columbia Route, development of an alternate route enabled migration even if there was trouble between the United States and the United Kingdom. The Applegate brothers became the first known white people in present-day Lava Beds National Monument.

The opening of the Applegate Trail appeared to bring the first regular contact between the Modoc and the European-American settlers, who had largely ignored their territory before. Many of the events of the Modoc War took place along the trail.

===Emigrant invasion===
From 1846 to 1873, thousands of emigrants entered the Modoc territory. Beginning in 1847, the Modoc raided the invading emigrants on the Applegate Trail under the leadership of Old Chief Schonchin.

In September 1852, the Modoc destroyed an emigrant train at Bloody Point on the east shore of Tule Lake, killing all but three of the 65 people in the party. The Modoc took two young girls as captives. One or both of them may have been killed several years later by jealous Modoc women. The only man to survive the attack made his way to Yreka, California. After hearing his news, Yreka settlers organized a militia under Sheriff Charles McDermit, Jim Crosby, and Ben Wright. They went to the scene of the massacre to bury the dead and avenge their deaths. Crosby&#x27;s party had a skirmish with a band of Modoc and returned to Yreka.

Wright and a small group stayed on to avenge the deaths. He was a notorious Indian hater. Accounts differ as to what took place when Wright&#x27;s party met the Modoc on the Lost River, but most agree that Wright planned to ambush them, which he did in November 1852. Wright and his forces attacked, killing approximately 40 Modoc, in what came to be known as the &quot;Ben Wright Massacre.&quot;

===Treaty with the United States===

The United States, the Klamath, the Modoc, and the Yahooskin band of Snake tribes signed a treaty in 1864 that established the Klamath Reservation. It required the tribes to cede the land bounded on the north by the 44th parallel, on the west and south by the ridges of the Cascade Mountains, and on the east by lines touching Goose Lake and Henley Lake back up to the 44th parallel.

In return, the United States was to make a lump sum payment of $35,000, and annual payments totaling $80,000 over 15 years, as well as provide infrastructure and staff for a reservation. The treaty provided that if the Indians drank or stored intoxicating liquor on the reservation, the payments could be withheld and that the United States could locate additional tribes on the reservation in the future. 

The treaty required that the Modoc surrender their lands near Lost River, Tule Lake, and Lower Klamath Lake in exchange for lands in the Upper Klamath Valley. They did so, under the leadership of Chief Schonchin. The Indian agent estimated the total population of the three tribes at about 2,000 when the treaty was signed.

The land of the reservation did not provide enough food for both the Klamath and the Modoc peoples. Illness and tension between the tribes increased. The Modoc requested a separate reservation closer to their ancestral home, but neither the federal nor the California government approved it.

In 1870 &quot;Kintpuash&quot; (also called Captain Jack) led a band of Modoc to leave the reservation and return to their traditional homelands. They built a village near the Lost River. These Modoc had not been adequately represented in the treaty negotiations and wished to end the harassment by the Klamath on the reservation.

===Modoc War===
In November 1872, the U.S. Army was sent to Lost River to attempt to force Kintpuash&#x27;s band back to the reservation. A battle broke out, and the Modoc escaped to what is called Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold in what is now Lava Beds National Monument, California. The band of fewer than 53 warriors was able to hold off the 3,000 U.S. Army troops for several months, defeating them in combat several times. In April 1873, the Modoc left the Stronghold and began to splinter. Kintpuash and his group were the last to be captured, on June 4, 1873, when they voluntarily gave themselves up. U.S. government personnel had assured them that their people would be treated fairly and the warriors would be allowed to live on their own land.

The U.S. Army tried, convicted and executed Kintpuash and three of his warriors in October 1873 for the murder of Major General Edward Canby earlier that year at a parley. Canby had violated agreements made with the Modoc. The Army sent the rest of the band to Oklahoma as prisoners of war with Scarfaced Charley as their chief. The tribe&#x27;s spiritual leader, Curley Headed Doctor, was also forced to remove to Indian Territory.

In the 1870s, Peter Cooper brought Indians to speak to Indian rights groups in eastern cities. One of the delegations was from the Modoc and Klamath tribes. In 1909, the group in Oklahoma was given permission to return to Oregon. Several people did, but most stayed at their new home.

==Culture==
The religion of the Modoc is not known in detail. The number five figured heavily in ritual, as in the &quot;Shuyuhalsh&quot;, a five-night dance rite of passage for adolescent girls. A sweat lodge was used for purification and mourning ceremonies.

==Namesakes==
Modoc Plateau, Modoc National Forest, Modoc County, California; Modoc, Indiana; and numerous other places are named after this group of people.

<doc id="396677" wikidata="Q318272" url="?curid=396677" title="Sancho VII of Navarre">
<text>Sancho VII (; 11577 April 1234) called the Strong (, ) was King of Navarre from 1194 until his death in 1234. He was the son and heir of Sancho VI, whom he followed as the second king to hold the title of &quot;King of Navarre&quot;. Sancho VII was the first to use the chains of Navarre as his blazon, a symbol that later would become the main one of Navarre, and the last member of the Jiménez dynasty, which had ruled since the 9th century.

== Youth ==
Sancho was probably the eldest child of Sancho VI and Sancha, daughter of Alfonso VII of León, born soon after their marriage, probably in Tudela, their usual residence.

Sancho&#x27;s younger sister Berengaria was married to Richard I of England in 1191 on the island of Cyprus on the way to the Holy Land for the Third Crusade. Sancho and Richard were reputed to have been good friends and close allies, even before the marriage brought them together. The French took advantage of Richard&#x27;s captivity in Germany and captured certain key fortresses of the Plantagenet dominions including Loches. When Richard returned to his continental lands in 1194, the knights of Sancho were besieging the castle for him. As soon as Richard arrived though, Sancho was forced to return to Navarre at the news of the death of his father. He was crowned in Pamplona on 15 August.

== Reign ==
Sancho arrived late at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195 and thus ruined good relations with Alfonso VIII of Castile. The ensuing confrontation resulted in Sancho devastating Soria and Almazán and Alfonso accepted the Peace of Tarazona.

Sancho made expeditions against Murcia and Andalusia, and, between 1198 and 1200, he campaigned in Africa, probably in the service of the Almohads, whose help he wanted against Castile. Taking advantage of his absence, Alfonso VIII of Castile and Peter II of Aragon invaded Navarre, which lost the provinces of Álava, Guipúzcoa, and Biscay to Castile. These conquests were subsequently confirmed by the Treaty of Guadalajara (1207).

Sancho&#x27;s leadership was decisive in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the year 1212. In that engagement, the Christian forces of Sancho, Alfonso, Afonso II of Portugal, and Peter II of Aragón allied to defeat the forces of the Almohad Caliph Muhammad an-Nasir. Sancho&#x27;s troops cut the chains guarding the tent and Slavic guards ring of the Miramamolín, supreme commander of the Al-Andalusian Forces. For this, it is believed the chains became the symbol of Navarre and replaced the sable eagle on a golden field with a golden chain on a gules field in the Navarrese coat of arms. But others suspect they represented the Basques&#x27; star-like Sun of Death seen on their Hilarri (Basques&#x27; Stelae) or houses traditionally for protection, and perhaps painted on their shields too with the same religious purpose, meaning of Life or Death, or the new Imagery used for Jesus or Christianity as for others were the Christi Anagram or plain Cross on the shield.

Sancho&#x27;s relations with the countries north of the Pyrenees were notably better than his Castilian ones. Several Pyrenean counties declared themselves his vassals and he concluded treaties with John, King of England, and the various Aragonese kings of his time, the aforementioned Peter II and James I. With the latter he signed at Tudela, in 1231, which was never finished, a treaty stating that whoever survived the other would inherit unopposed the other&#x27;s kingdom.

Sancho continued the construction of a new cathedral in Pamplona, as begun by his father and to be finished by his successor. The construction of a certain Gothic bridge over the Ebro in Tudela has also been attributed to him.

== Succession ==

Sancho VII was married twice. His first wife was Constance, daughter of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Beatrice of Béziers, whom he married in 1195. He repudiated her a few years later. The identity of his second wife is disputed; some sources mention her as Clemence, daughter of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, while other sources claim she was the daughter of Yusuf II, an emir from Morocco. Sancho VII had no known children by either wife. According to Charles of Viana, however, he had a son with his second wife, who died in an accident when he was 15 years old.

As the result of prolonged and painful illness, starting with a varicose ulcer on his right leg and ashamed of it and his consequent obesity, Sancho went into retirement at Tudela at some point, when his youngest sister Blanche came from Champagne and took administration of the kingdom until she died in 1229. His eldest sister, Berengaria, Queen of England, died in 1230, thus leaving Sancho alone among the children of Sancho VI. When he died in his castle at Tudela, probably of complications related to the varicose ulcer in his leg, his only nephew and Blanche&#x27;s son Theobald IV of Champagne was recognized as his successor.

== Legacy ==

According to Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, Sancho left a large library, although the number of 1.7 million books is clearly exaggerated. The cultural contacts with the Muslim Kingdoms that he visited and battled with, his friendship with his brother-in-law King Richard, and his sister Blanche&#x27;s court of Troyes, at the time the most refined in Europe, must have left an important influence on the King&#x27;s personal intellect, bringing to him an advantageous outlook from the one well set already by their father at his youth, full however with peccadilloes and other impetuous extravaganza.

Sancho left the kingdom with a wealthy treasury and improved communications was in his day one of the most advanced in human rights, and its Jewish community enjoyed the best standing in Christian Europe, which after all had been the work and result of the Jimenez royal house for centuries. He was originally interred in the church of San Nicolás, but was later moved to Roncesvalles after much resistance from the local Clergy. His remains have since been exhumed for study and examined by the physician Luis del Campo, also the king&#x27;s biographer, who measured him at 2.20 metres tall (7&#x27;3&quot;), probably the basis for his &quot;strength&quot; epitaph.

<text>Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) is a network of canals connecting Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and the eastern part of the Black Country. The BCN is connected to the rest of the English canal system at several junctions. It was owned and operated by the Birmingham Canal Navigation Company from 1767 to 1948.

At its working peak, the BCN contained about 160 miles (257 km) of canals; today just over 100 miles (160 km) are navigable, and the majority of traffic is from tourist and residential narrowboats.

==History==

The earliest mention of the Birmingham Canal Navigation appears in &quot;Aris&#x27;s Birmingham Gazette&quot; on 11 April 1768. Here it was reported that on 25 March 1768, the first general assembly of the Company of Proprietors of the Birmingham Canal Navigation was held at the Swann Inn, Birmingham, to raise funds to submit for an act of Parliament. The first canal to be built in the area was the Birmingham Canal, authorized by the (8 Geo. 3. c. 38) and built from 1768 to 1772 under the supervision of James Brindley from the, then, edge of Birmingham, with termini at Newhall Wharf (since built over) and Paradise Wharf (also known as Old Wharf) near to Gas Street Basin to meet the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Aldersley (north of Wolverhampton). It opened for business on 14 September 1772. 

The (9 Geo. 3. c. 53) was obtained to construct the canal through a detached portion of the county of Shropshire, near Oldbury, and it included powers to make reservoirs anywhere within 3 miles between Smethwick and Oldbury.
The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, from Birmingham to Tamworth, followed in 1784 with the Birmingham Canal Company merging with the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal Company immediately, to form what was originally called the &quot;Birmingham and Birmingham and Fazeley Canal Company&quot;. This cumbersome name was short-lived, and the combined company became incorporated as the &quot;Birmingham Canal Navigations Company&quot; from 1794, as the network was expanded. The (34 Geo. 3. c. 87) authorized the extension from Broadwater to Walsall, and the short cut between Bloomfield and Deepfield, where the Coseley Tunnel was constructed, which with a length of , avoided a detour around Tipton Hill of .

Between 1825 and 1829 the canal was improved by the cutting down by of the summit at Smethwick, which occupied two and a half years, and cost £560,000 (), and by cutting off bends and erecting steam engines which reduced the cost of haulage by 4d. per ton.

Between 1825 and 1837 the navigation was improved between Spon Lane, Deepfield and Wolverhampton, saving a distance of six miles, which reduced the toll on coal by 9d per ton. At the same time the Titford Canal was constructed at a cost upwards of £200,000 ().

The junction with the Warwick and Birmingham Canal was made under powers of the &#x27; (55 Geo. 3. c. xl). These improvements were all consolidated under the &#x27; (5 &amp; 6 Will. 4. c. xxxiv).

From 1839 to 1843 the Tame Valley Canal was built, along with the Bentley, Rushall and Walsall Junction Canals opening up the Cannock Chase and Wyrley coal districts to the town of Birmingham at a cost upwards of £570,000 ().
The Wyrley and Essington Canal was incorporated by the Birmingham Canal Navigation Act 1792 which authorized the line from Wolverhampton to Sneyd Junction and Walsall. The extension to Huddlesford and the Lord Hay and Daw End branches were constructed under the Birmingham Canal Navigation Act 1794 (34 Geo. 3. c. 87). This amalgamated with the Birmingham Canal Navigations in 1840.

In 1855, the Cannock Extension Canal and the Wyrley Bank Branch were added to the network at a cost upwards of £100,000 ().

From 1855 to 1858 the Netherton Tunnel and other improvements cost the company upwards of £350,000 ().
In 1776, the Dudley Canal was authorized from Parkhead to the junction with the Stourbridge Canal. The Parkhead to Tipton Green section including Dudley Tunnel was made under the Dudley Canal Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3. c. 87), and the extension from Parkhead to Selly Oak Junction with the Oxford and Birmingham Canal, including the Gorsty Hill and Lappal Tunnels under the Selly Oak Canal Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 121). This canal became part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations in 1846 under the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccxliv).

It was re-established as a body corporate on 17 June 1835. It was taken over by the London and Birmingham Railway in 1846, and subsequently owned by the London and North Western Railway, then the London, Midland and Scottish Railway until 1 January 1948 when was it passed to the British Transport Commission.

==Levels==

The BCN is built on three main levels, each with its own reservoir.
* OD, the Birmingham Level;
* OD, the Wolverhampton Level;
* OD, the Walsall Level
These levels are linked by locks at various places on the network.

There are also stretches on their own levels.
* The Titford Canal and its branches were built at OD, linked to the Titford Reservoir (Titford Pool). A feeder supplies water to the Edgbaston Reservoir.
* A short section of the BCN Old Main Line, at Smethwick Summit, was built at OD. Pumps at either end were built to pump water used by the locks back to the summit – one at Spon Lane locks, and one at Smethwick locks: the Smethwick Engine. When the summit became too busy John Smeaton designed a scheme where it was lowered by to the Wolverhampton level, eliminating six locks and providing a parallel set of locks at Smethwick which improved traffic throughput. It also linked to the general Wolverhampton Level supply of water.

<text>Burton Richter (March 22, 1931 – July 18, 2018) was an American physicist. He led the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) team which co-discovered the J/ψ meson in 1974, alongside the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) team led by Samuel Ting for which they won Nobel Prize for Physics in 1976. This discovery was part of the November Revolution of particle physics. He was the SLAC director from 1984 to 1999.

==Life and work==
A native of New York City, Richter was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and was raised in the Queens neighborhood of Far Rockaway. His parents were Fanny (Pollack) and Abraham Richter, a textile worker. He graduated from Far Rockaway High School, a school that also produced fellow laureates Baruch Samuel Blumberg and Richard Feynman. He attended Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, then continued on to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1952 and his PhD in 1956. He then joined the faculty of Stanford University, becoming a full professor in 1967. Richter was director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) from 1984 to 1999. He was a senior fellow of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Paul Pigott Professor in the Physical Sciences Emeritus of Stanford University.

As a professor at Stanford, Richter designed the SPEAR (Stanford Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring) particle accelerator with the help of another Stanford physics professor, David Ritson. When eventually resources were secured, Richter led the building of SPEAR, with the support of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. With it he led a team that discovered a new subatomic particle he called a &quot;ψ&quot; (psi). This discovery was also made by the team led by Samuel Ting at Brookhaven National Laboratory, but he called the particle &quot;J&quot;. The particle thus became known as the J/ψ meson. Richter and Ting were jointly awarded the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.

During 1975 Richter spent a sabbatical year at CERN where he worked on the ISR experiment R702.

In 1987, Richter received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Richter was a member of the JASON advisory group and served on the board of directors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government.

Richter was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2003.

In May 2007, he visited Iran and Sharif University of Technology.

Richter is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

In 2012, President Barack Obama announced that Burton Richter was a co-recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award, along with Mildred Dresselhaus.

In 2014, President Obama also awarded Richter the 2012 National Medal of Science. His citation read, &quot;For pioneering contributions to the development of electron accelerators, including circular and linear colliders, synchrotron light sources, and for discoveries in elementary particle physics and contributions to energy policy.&quot;

In 2013, Richter commented on an open letter from Tom Wigley, Kerry Emanuel, Ken Caldeira, and James Hansen, that Angela Merkel was &quot;wrong to shut down nuclear&quot;.

In 2014, Richter was among the residents of a continuing care retirement center who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against a continuing care retirement home&#x27;s financial practices.

Richter died on July 18, 2018, in Stanford, California, at the age 87.

<doc id="396686" wikidata="Q145889" url="?curid=396686" title="Hazel">
<text>Hazels are plants of the genus Corylus of deciduous trees and large shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The genus is usually placed in the birch family, Betulaceae, though some botanists split the hazels (with the hornbeams and allied genera) into a separate family Corylaceae. The fruit of the hazel is the hazelnut.

Hazels have simple, rounded leaves with double-serrate margins. The flowers are produced very early in spring before the leaves, and are monoecious, with single-sex catkins. The male catkins are pale yellow and long, and the female ones are very small and largely concealed in the buds, with only the bright-red, 1-to-3 mm-long styles visible. The fruits are nuts long and 1–2 cm diameter, surrounded by an involucre (husk) which partly to fully encloses the nut.

The shape and structure of the involucre, and also the growth habit (whether a tree or a suckering shrub), are important in the identification of the different species of hazel.

The pollen of hazel species, which are often the cause for allergies in late winter or early spring, can be identified under magnification (600×) by their characteristic granular exines bearing three conspicuous pores.

==Species==
&quot;Corylus&quot; has around 14–18 species. The circumscription of species in eastern Asia is disputed, with World Flora Online and the &quot;Flora of China&quot; differing in which taxa are accepted, within this region. WFO accepts 17 species while Flora of China accepts 20 species (including &quot;Corylus mandshurica&quot;).

Only those taxa accepted by both sources are listed below.

The species are grouped as follows:
* Nut surrounded by a soft, leafy involucre, multiple-stemmed, suckering shrubs to 12 m tall
** Involucre short, about the same length as the nut
*** &quot;Corylus americana&quot; – American hazel, eastern North America
*** &quot;Corylus avellana&quot; – Common hazel, Europe and western Asia
*** &quot;Corylus heterophylla&quot; – Asian hazel, Asia
*** &quot;Corylus yunnanensis&quot; – Yunnan hazel, central and southern China
** Involucre long, twice the length of the nut or more, forming a &#x27;beak&#x27;
*** &quot;Corylus colchica&quot; – Colchican filbert, Caucasus
*** &quot;Corylus cornuta&quot; – Beaked hazel, North America
*** &quot;Corylus maxima&quot; – Filbert, southeastern Europe and southwest Asia
*** &quot;Corylus sieboldiana&quot; – Asian beaked hazel, northeastern Asia and Japan (syn. &quot;C. mandshurica&quot;)
* Nut surrounded by a stiff, spiny involucre, single-stemmed trees to 20–35 m tall
** Involucre moderately spiny and also with glandular hairs
*** &quot;Corylus chinensis&quot; – Chinese hazel, western China
*** &quot;Corylus colurna&quot; – Turkish hazel, southeastern Europe and Asia Minor
*** &quot;Corylus fargesii&quot; – Farges&#x27; hazel, western China
*** &quot;Corylus jacquemontii&quot; – Jacquemont&#x27;s hazel, Himalaya
*** &quot;Corylus wangii&quot; – Wang&#x27;s hazel, southwest China
** Involucre densely spiny, resembling a chestnut burr
*** &quot;Corylus ferox&quot; – Himalayan hazel, Himalaya, Tibet and southwest China (syn. &quot;C. tibetica&quot;).

Several hybrids exist, and they can occur between species in different sections of the genus, e.g. &quot;Corylus × colurnoides&quot; (&quot;C. avellana&quot; × &quot;C. colurna&quot;). The oldest confirmed hazel species is &quot;Corylus johnsonii&quot; found as fossils in the Ypresian-age rocks of Ferry County, Washington.

Chilean hazel (&quot;Gevuina avellana&quot;), despite its name, is not related to this genus.

== Ecology ==
At least 21 species of fungus have a mutualistic relationship with hazel. &quot;Lactarius pyrogalus&quot; grows almost exclusively on hazel, and hazel is one of two kinds of host for the rare &quot;Hypocreopsis rhododendri&quot;. Several rare species of &quot;Graphidion&quot; lichen depend on hazel trees. In the UK, five species of moth are specialised to feed on hazel including &quot;Parornix devoniella&quot;. Animals which eat hazelnuts include red deer, dormouse and red squirrel.

== Uses ==

The nuts of all hazels are edible. The common hazel is the species most extensively grown for its nuts, followed in importance by the filbert. Nuts are also harvested from the other species, but apart from the filbert, none is of significant commercial importance.

A number of cultivars of the common hazel and filbert are grown as ornamental plants in gardens, including forms with contorted stems (&quot;C. avellana&quot; &#x27;Contorta&#x27;, popularly known as &quot;Corkscrew hazel&quot; or &quot;Harry Lauder&#x27;s walking stick&quot; from its gnarled appearance); with weeping branches (&quot;C. avellana&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27;); and with purple leaves (&quot;C. maxima&quot; &#x27;Purpurea&#x27;).

Hazel is a traditional material used for making wattle, withy fencing, baskets, and the frames of coracle boats. The tree can be coppiced, and regenerating shoots allow for harvests every few years. There is a seven-year cycle (cut and grow) for hurdle (fence) making.

Hazels are used as food plants by the larvae of various species of Lepidoptera including &quot;Eriocrania chrysolepidella&quot;.

==Culture==

The Celts believed hazelnuts gave one wisdom and inspiration. There are numerous variations on an ancient tale that nine hazel trees grew around a sacred pool, dropping into the water nuts that were eaten by salmon (a fish sacred to Druids), which absorbed the wisdom. A Druid teacher, in his bid to become omniscient, caught one of these special salmon and asked a student to cook the fish, but not to eat it. While he was cooking it, a blister formed and the pupil used his thumb to burst it, which he naturally sucked to cool, thereby absorbing the fish&#x27;s wisdom. This boy was called Fionn Mac Cumhail (Fin McCool) and went on to become one of the most heroic leaders in Gaelic mythology.

&quot;The Hazel Branch&quot; from &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; claims that hazel branches offer the greatest protection from snakes and other things that creep on the earth. In the Grimm tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;, a hazel branch is planted by the protagonist at her mother&#x27;s grave and grows into a tree that is the site where the girl&#x27;s wishes are granted by birds.

The Russian Oreshnik () missile is named for the Hazel tree.

<doc id="396687" wikidata="Q1064563" url="?curid=396687" title="Charles Goodnight">
<text>Charles Goodnight (March 5, 1836 – December 12, 1929), also known as Charlie Goodnight, was a rancher in the American West. In 1955, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Early years==

Goodnight was born in Macoupin County, Illinois, northeast of St. Louis, the fourth child of Charles Goodnight and the former Charlotte Collier. Goodnight&#x27;s father&#x27;s grave is located in a pasture south of Bunker Hill, Illinois. Goodnight was descended from immigrant pioneer Hans Michael Gutknecht, from Mannheim, Germany, making him a distant relative of Harry S. Truman.

Goodnight moved to Texas in 1846 with his mother and stepfather, Hiram Daugherty. In 1856, he became a cowboy and served with the local militia, fighting against the Comanche. A year later, in 1857, Goodnight joined the Texas Rangers. Goodnight is also known for raising and leading a posse against the Comanche in 1860 that located the Indian supply camp where Cynthia Ann Parker was working with her husband, Peta Nocona, then guiding Texas Rangers to the camp, leading to Cynthia Ann&#x27;s recapture. In 1864, after serving in the Frontier Regiment during the American Civil War, Goodnight returned to Palo Pinto County, Texas. 

Goodnight described what it took to become a scout, &quot;First, he must be born a natural woodsman and have the faculty of never needing a compass except in snow storms or darkness.&quot;

== Cattle ==
In 1866, Oliver Loving and he drove their first herd of cattle from Fort Belknap (Texas) to Fort Sumner, along what would become known as the Goodnight-Loving Trail. The trail crossed ninety miles of the southern portion of the Llano Estacado, before crossing the Pecos River at Horsehead Crossing. Goodnight invented the chuckwagon, during this initial cattle drive. They extended the trail into Colorado, where they established a contract with John Wesley Iliff, eventually providing 30,000 head of longhorn by 1876. They also formed a partnership with John Chisum, supplying cattle to Fort Sumner. In 1868, Goodnight established Rock Canon Ranch, west of Pueblo, Colorado.

To take advantage of available grass, timber, water, and game, Goodnight founded in 1876 what was to become the first Texas Panhandle ranch, the JA Ranch, in the Palo Duro Canyon. By 1885, the ranch covered 1,325,000 acres and held 100,000 head of cattle.

==Bison==

In addition to raising cattle 1876, the Goodnights preserved a herd of native plains bison that year, which is said to survive to this day in Caprock Canyons State Park. The herd in Caprock Canyons was actually donated in name by JA Ranch, which Goodnight managed for years. Bison of this herd were introduced into the Yellowstone National Park in 1902 and into the larger zoos and ranches throughout the nation. He also crossbred the bison with domestic cattle, which he called cattalo.

==Personal life==

On July 26, 1870, Goodnight married Mary Ann &quot;Molly&quot; Dyer, a teacher from Weatherford, west of Fort Worth. He developed a practical sidesaddle for Molly.

One of his great-great-great nephews was professional bull rider Brent Thurman.

==Goodnight Ranch House restoration ==

The Charles and Mary Ann (Molly) Goodnight Ranch House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Goodnight home is located one-quarter mile (400 m) south of U.S. Highway 287 about east of Amarillo. The home was renovated by the Armstrong County Museum from 2006 to 2012. The structure was painted to resemble its appearance in 1887. The interior was restored based on research into the original paint and wallpapers used. In 2005, Amarillo businessman Brent Caviness and a partner donated the home and . Mary Ann Goodnight taught children in the bunkhouse. The cowboys slept there at night, and she moved their things aside for school during the day, Goodin said.

The house was scheduled to open in April 2013.

==Reputation==
Goodnight is presented as a good and decent man. J. Frank Dobie, who knew Goodnight, is quoted in &quot;Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle&quot; as having said: &quot;I have met a lot of good men, several fine gentlemen, hordes of cunning climbers, plenty of loud-braying asses and plenty of dumb oxen, but I haven&#x27;t lived long enough or traveled far enough to meet more than two or three men I&#x27;d call great. This is a word I will not bandy around. To me, Charles Goodnight was great-natured.&quot;

Other views have been expressed. In Time-Life&#x27;s 1973 publication &quot;The Cowboys&quot;, the author states (p. 62): &quot;Goodnight was no better than the rest. Once when his wife expressed shock at some vigilante hangings (&#x27;I understand&#x27;, she exclaimed, &#x27;they hanged them to a telegraph pole!&#x27;) Charlie replied quietly, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t think it hurt the telegraph pole.&#x27; What she didn&#x27;t know was that the victims had actually been strung up with Goodnight&#x27;s full approval.&quot; The men hanged were caught in the act of murder and cattle rustling.

==In literature==

The western novelist Matt Braun&#x27;s novel &quot;Texas Empire&quot; is based on the life of Goodnight and fictionalizes the founding of the JA Ranch. &quot;The Goodnight Trail&quot; is the name of a novel by Ralph Compton. Similarly, Mari Sandoz&#x27;s &quot;Old Jules Country&quot; in the part &quot;Some dedicated men&quot; relates the difficulties of Goodnight&#x27;s cattle drives to Colorado. In James A. Michener&#x27;s novel, &quot;Centennial&quot;, the Skimmerhorn Trail is based on the actual Goodnight-Loving Trail. In addition, his name is mentioned in the novel; the character R. J. Poteet appears to have been based on Goodnight. T.L. Davis&#x27; Shadow Soldier features the Goodnight-Loving cattle drive of 1866 as a means for J.D. Wilkes to make it to Colorado with Oliver Loving and in the sequel Home to Texas, Goodnight is often referenced. 
All four of Larry McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series novels include brief appearances by Goodnight. His appearance in the prequel &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; is historically inaccurate. The story takes place during the Santa Fe Expedition of 1841, when Goodnight would have been only five years old. Further, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; is a fictionalized account of Goodnight and Loving&#x27;s third cattle drive. Woodrow F. Call represents Goodnight, Augustus McCrae is Oliver Loving. Though the characters have personalities rather different from their real-life counterparts, the novel borrows heavily from actual events, in particular Loving&#x27;s ambush by Indians and Goodnight&#x27;s attentive care as Loving died from an arrow-induced infection. Call returns McCrae&#x27;s body to Texas, just as Goodnight returned Loving for burial in Weatherford. The marker that Call carves for Deets is based on an epitaph Charles Goodnight created for Bose Ikard, an ex-slave who worked alongside Goodnight most of his life. He also plays his largest role in the final volume, &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;. He is played in the miniseries &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; by Chris Penn, in &quot;Comanche Moon&quot; by Jeremy Ratchford, and in &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; by James Gammon.

== In television ==
The &quot;Yellowstone&quot; spin-off show &quot;1883&quot; featured Goodnight as a cameo appearance. In &quot;1883&quot; season 1, episode 7,Goodnight helps drive off a group of attacking bandits. He was played by series creator and writer Taylor Sheridan. 

In the 1977 Television series Centennial A man named Goodnight is mentioned driving cattle to Colorado. It is commonly agreed that he is the one mentioned

<doc id="396688" wikidata="Q337680" url="?curid=396688" title="Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont">
<text>Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont, PC (19 August 171021 August 1763), of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, Petworth House in Sussex, and of Egremont House in Mayfair, London, was a British statesman who served as Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1761 to 1763.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son and heir of Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet, of Orchard Wyndham, Secretary at War in 1712, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1713 and Tory leader in the House of Commons during the reign of King George I (1714–1727) and during the early years of King George II (1727–1760).

His mother was Catherine Seymour, daughter of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, and sister of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, created in 1749 Earl of Egremont and Baron Cockermouth, with special remainder to his nephew Charles Wyndham, the subject of this article.

==Inheritance==
He succeeded to the Orchard Wyndham estates and as 4th baronet on his father&#x27;s death in 1740, and in 1750 succeeded by special remainder as 2nd Earl of Egremont, on the death of his maternal uncle Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, 1st Earl of Egremont, and received, as his share of the Seymour inheritance, the former Percy estates, including Egremont Castle in Cumbria, Leconfield Castle in Yorkshire and the palatial Petworth House in Sussex (rebuilt by the 6th Duke). These were formerly owned by the Percy family, and had been inherited by the 7th Duke of Somerset from his mother, Lady Elizabeth Percy (died 1722), daughter and heiress of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland.

His younger brother was Percy Wyndham-O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond, created Earl of Thomond, having become the chosen heir of his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s childless husband Henry O&#x27;Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond (1688–1741).

==Career==
Wyndham served as member of parliament for Bridgwater (Somerset) in 1734–1741, Appleby (Cumberland) in 1741–1747, and for Taunton (Somerset) in 1747–1750.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

In October 1761, Egremont was appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department in succession to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. His term of office, during which he acted in concert with his brother-in-law George Grenville, was mainly occupied with the declaration of war on Spain and with the negotiations for peace with France and Spain, the terms of which Wyndham seems to have disliked. He was also involved with the proceedings against John Wilkes. He died in office 21 August 1763.

He was Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland 1751–1763 and Lord Lieutenant of Sussex 1762–1763.

==Marriage and issue==
On 12 March 1750/51, Wyndham married Hon. Alicia Maria Carpenter, a daughter of George Carpenter, 2nd Baron Carpenter of Killaghy, by his wife Elizabeth Petty. He had progeny including:
*George O&#x27;Brien Wyndham (1751–1837), succeeded as 3rd Earl of Egremont.
*Lady Elizabeth Alicia Maria Wyndham (1752–1826), who married Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Carnarvon, and had children.
*Lady Frances Wyndham (1755–1795), who married Charles Marsham, later Earl of Romney, and had children.
*Lady Charlotte Catherine Wyndham (5 September 1756April 1757).
*Hon. Percy Charles Wyndham (27 September 17575 August 1833).
*Hon. Charles William Wyndham (17601828)
*Hon. William Frederick Wyndham (1763–1828), who married Hon. Frances Mary Harford, daughter of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, and had children; his second wife was Julia de Smorzewska, Countess de Spyterki, by whom he also had children.

==Assessment==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Horace Walpole perhaps rated Egremont&#x27;s talents too low when he said he had neither knowledge of business, nor the smallest share of parliamentary abilities.

<text>Aero Spacelines, Inc. was an American aircraft manufacturer from 1960 to 1968 that converted Boeing 377 Stratocruiser and C-97 aircraft into the famous Guppy line of airplanes, re-engineered to transport oversized cargo such as space exploration vehicles. These inspired later aircraft of similar concept, such as the Conroy Skymonster, Myasishchev VM-T, Airbus Beluga and Boeing Dreamlifter. 

== History ==
Aero Spacelines was formed with only one customer in mind: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA needed to transport outsize cargo from manufacturing plants such as the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. These items were too large to be safely transported by rail or truck. Shipping by sea was time-consuming, expensive, and risky, with the danger of damaging the cargo on turbulent seas. But no aircraft of the day was large enough.

John M. &quot;Jack&quot; Conroy, a retired United States Air Force pilot, and Lee Mansdorf, an aircraft salesman and entrepreneur, formulated the Guppy concept one evening over dinner. They decided to create a company to manufacture outsized aircraft. Conroy hired Robert W. Lillibridge as vice president of manufacturing and engineering, and a team was assembled for the project. Financing was provided by venture capitalist William Ballon, a World War II combat veteran also from the Army Air Corps. In 1960, Aero Spacelines began working at Van Nuys Airport, California, to transform a Boeing 377 airliner into the Pregnant Guppy.

NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini made early use of the Pregnant Guppy to transport the first and second stages of Titan II GLV from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral, Florida. Subsequent versions of the Guppy series hauled the S-IVB, the third stage of the Saturn booster from California to Florida.
Aero Spacelines was sold in August 1965 to Unexcelled, Inc., a publicly-traded company that had subsidiaries engaged in discount store retailing, meatpacking equipment and iron castings. Unexcelled also owned American Airmotive Corporation, an aircraft maintenance and repair organization. 

In 1968, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) gave Aero Spacelines an exemption permitting them to offer Guppy transport services to the public. The CAB was a now-defunct federal agency that, at the time, tightly regulated almost all US commercial air transport. The CAB&#x27;s permission was required for Aero Spacelines to offer air transport services to the public.

By November 1968, NASA had paid Aero Spacelines $11,591,633 in contracts.

In 1972, Unexcelled changed its name to Twin Fair, the name of its retailing subsidiary. In 1981, Twin Fair sold Aero Spacelines to Tracor, which dropped the name in favor of Tracor Aviation.

In 1969, Jack Conroy, no longer at Aero, built the Conroy Skymonster, a similar concept to the Guppy series but based on the Canadair CL-44 aircraft instead of the C-97.

As of March 2021, one Super Guppy was still in operation. NASA uses it to transport vehicles, and leases it to third parties when not in use.

In early 2016, NASA used that aircraft to transport the main structure of Orion crew capsule, from its Michoud Manufacturing Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the capsule underwent its first uncrewed test flight aboard the Space Launch System rocket. In November 2019, NASA used the aircraft to transport the Orion capsule from the Kennedy Space Center to the Mansfield Lahm Airport in Ohio for thermal and vacuum tests.

==List of aircraft==

<doc id="396691" wikidata="Q5090483" url="?curid=396691" title="Chemical mortar battalion">
<text>Chemical mortar battalions were United States Army non-divisional units that were attached to infantry divisions during World War II. They were armed with 4.2-inch (107 mm) chemical mortars. For this reason they were also called the &quot;Four-deucers&quot;.

In 1943, General Mark Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army established a policy that no infantry division would be committed to combat without a chemical mortar battalion attached. As a result, when infantry units were rotated out of combat, the mortar battalions often stayed in the line and were attached to fresh units. Chemical mortars were in such high demand that often the companies of a battalion would be split up and assigned to different divisions. On the first day that General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army became operational, in the summer of 1944, he issued a standing order to his staff that no infantry division would be committed to combat without a chemical mortar battalion attached, and no infantry regiment would be committed without a mortar company attached.

==Development and capabilities of the chemical mortar==

Mortars came to be acknowledged by U.S. Army commanders and personnel as being one of the most effective means of quickly striking at stationary targets, such as machine gun nests, prepared strongpoints, pillboxes and even artillery positions. Other advantages mortars offered compared to full-sized artillery pieces were their easier transportation, assembly, and disassembly. Thanks to their relatively small size, mortars were able to fire from concealed positions, such as natural escarpments on hillsides, or from woods.

The 4.2 in (107 mm) chemical mortar was developed from the British World War I-era 4 inch (101.6 mm) Stokes mortar. The Stokes mortar could fire twenty shells per minute and had a range of and in this way was capable of overwhelming enemy trenches. The American-built M1 4.2 inch (107 mm) mortar, first introduced in 1924, had a rifled barrel and a range of . By the 1930s, after modifying the bore, improving the two-legged support and the recoil mechanism, and producing barrels made of seamless nickel steel, the M1A1 model was capable of sending shells 

Chemical mortars were so named because of their original intent of firing poison gas, incendiary and smoke marker shells. Chemical shells were on standby during World War II, to be used in retaliation should the enemy employ chemical weapons first. By 1942, after authorization had been sought and granted to use high explosive shells, the new M2 model was produced with a stronger barrel. Its rate of fire was 40 rounds in the first two minutes, 100 rounds in the first 20 minutes and thereafter a sustained rate of 80 rounds per hour. These variations were caused by the stresses and strains on the barrels and the rest of firing mechanisms that were being imposed by different firing conditions.

Later, the mortar was developed to be capable of firing shells from a mere at minimum propellant charge, to a range of . The propellant charges were manufactured as square disks with a hole in the middle, strung together, fitted into cartridges, and sewn together into bundles of various thicknesses. The rifled barrel gave the mortar remarkable accuracy; fire was often called on targets within fifty yards of friendly positions. The low-velocity shells were totally silent in transit and gave no warning of their powerful explosions (the M2 mortar&#x27;s M3 high explosive shell contained of explosives, placing it midway between the of the 105 mm howitzer M2A1&#x27;s M1 shell and the of the 155 mm howitzer M1&#x27;s M102 shell), which tended to create panic among enemy forces who were unexpectedly subjected to their firepower. The mortar was called the &quot;grass-cutter&quot; by German troops because its high explosive shell exploded and fragmented just a few inches above ground level. The mortars often fired white phosphorus munitions (WP) shells to block enemy observation with smoke; white phosphorus also caused casualties and fires, being especially effective against dug-in troops because the burning particles arced upward and fell directly down into foxholes.

==Battalion history and activation==

Chemical mortar battalions had their origins in gas regiments, which were first organized in the interwar period. They were redesignated chemical regiments in 1929. The 1st and 2nd Gas Regiments were allotted to the Regular Army. The 1st Gas Regiment had seen service in World War I. It was inactivated on 15 April 1935 and concurrently reorganized entirely with Organized Reserve personnel as a Regular Army Inactive unit. It was inactivated on 9 October 1940 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by transfer of personnel to the 902nd Chemical Regiment. The 2nd Chemical Regiment was constituted in the Regular Army 1 April 1931, assigned to the Zone of the Interior, and allotted to the Fourth Corps Area. Company C, the only active unit, was organized 1 April 1931 at Fort Benning, Georgia, from Company D, 1st Chemical Regiment. The remainder of the regiment was organized in June 1932 with Organized Reserve personnel as a Regular Army Inactive unit at Columbus, Georgia. It was inactivated on 25 August 1940 at Columbus by relief of personnel.

There were two separate Regular Army chemical battalions, one animal-drawn and one motorized. The animal-drawn 1st Chemical Battalion was located in Hawaii due to the mountainous terrain there. Company A, the only active unit, was organized 4 March 1931 at Schofield Barracks from the 2nd Separate Chemical Company. It was disbanded on 12 March 1942. The 2nd Chemical Battalion was organized on 16 April 1935, less Companies B and C, at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and performed duties as the support unit for the Chemical Warfare School. Companies B and C were allotted to the Third Corps Area as inactive units and organized with Organized Reserve personnel.

Four chemical regiments (the 101st-104th) were allotted to the National Guard in 1931, but these were never organized and were withdrawn from the National Guard in 1934 and allotted to the Organized Reserve as the 307th-310th Chemical Regiments. The headquarters of the 307th, 308th, and 310th Chemical Regiments were initiated in 1937, but the 309th Chemical Regiment was never initiated. All the regiments were disbanded on 18 October 1943. The 301st and 302nd Gas Regiments were constituted and initiated in the Organized Reserve in 1923, while the 303rd-306th Chemical Regiments were initiated in 1931. All the regiments were disbanded on 18 October 1943. The 902nd and 904th Chemical Regiments were constituted in the Organized Reserve in 1940 and intended to be used as support units for the Chemical Warfare School, but they were both inactivated by relief of personnel on 7 August 1941.

===Wartime===

Upon U.S. entry into World War II, the 1st and 2nd Chemical Regiments had only one company between them on active duty, the two separate chemical battalions also each had one active company, and there were also two separate chemical companies, one of which would be lost on Bataan and the other inactivated. The headquarters of the 1st and 2nd Chemical Regiments and 1st Separate Chemical Battalion were disbanded on 12 March 1942. Four more chemical mortar battalions (the 81st-84th) were activated by mid-1942, but the number of battalions remained at six until May 1943. After the 2nd, 3rd, 83rd, and 84th Battalions were sent overseas to participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the War Department authorized the activation of four more battalions in May and June 1943 (the 85th-88th).

The 2nd, 3rd, and 83rd Chemical Mortar Battalions were withdrawn from Italy in July 1944 and assigned to the U.S. Seventh Army to participate in the invasion of southern France, leaving only the 84th Battalion to support the U.S. Fifth Army. In June 1944, the Fifth Army converted two antiaircraft artillery battalions into the 99th and 100th Chemical Mortar Battalions, but they were not ready for combat until October 1944.

In late 1943 in the European Theater, Colonel Hugh V. Rowan, the theater chemical officer, had recommended 24 chemical mortar battalions (two battalions per corps and two per army) be assigned to the theater. However, the troop ceiling and troop basis forwarded from the War Department for the European Theater provided for only seven battalions. General Omar Bradley, the theater commander, tried unsuccessfully to get a battalion from Italy. Colonel Rowan realized that if the battalions in the United States reorganized under the September 1943 table of organization which reduced battalion strength from 1,010 to 622 officers and men, that would produce enough surplus personnel for eleven battalions (taking into account the battalions already existing and those to be created) and the theater would only need to requisition one more battalion above the War Department troop list. The 92nd Chemical Mortar Battalion was activated in England using a number of men which had been freed by the reorganization of the 81st Chemical Mortar Battalion.

In February 1944, a disappointed Rowan learned that the battalions in the United States had already been reorganized under the September 1943 table of organization. Rowan had successfully convinced the War Department to give him twelve battalions in the troop basis, but only seven would be available in 1944, including the two battalions in England (the 81st and 92nd) and two more (the 86th and 87th) that would arrive around projected date of D-Day.

Until the American drive into western Germany, chemical mortars were in short supply in the Twelfth United States Army Group; in September 1944, there were only four battalions (the 81st, 86th, 87th, and 92nd) assigned, and the battalions suffered from shortages of qualified officer and enlisted replacements. In December 1944, the 91st Chemical Mortar Battalion arrived in Europe and a &quot;steady influx&quot; of new battalions began; the 89th, 90th, 93rd, 94th, 95th, 96th, and 97th, leaving the Twelfth Army Group with a total of twelve battalions by the end of the war. The Sixth Army Group had four battalions (the 2nd, 3rd, 83rd, and 99th).

25 battalions served overseas, five of which (the 92nd and 97th-100th) were formed overseas.

Seven additional battalions formed late in the war via conversion from field artillery battalions were activated too late to serve overseas.

After World War II, the U.S. War Department transferred the operations and development of chemical mortars to the Ordnance Department, in this way making the mortar an official infantry weapon. The 2nd Chemical Mortar Battalion was the last of the chemical mortar battalions, and the only one to see combat after World War II. It was reactivated in 1949 and saw 1,008 days of combat during the Korean War. In January 1953, its combat personnel were transferred to the 461st Infantry Battalion (Heavy Mortar.)

==Battalion organization==

Originally, chemical mortar battalions had 36 officers, one warrant officer, and 973 enlisted men, for a total of 1,010, distributed among a headquarters, headquarters company, medical detachment, and four mortar companies. Each mortar company had twelve mortars organized into two platoons, each with two sections, with each section having three squads of one mortar each. Sidearms for battalion members included 820 M1911 pistols. There were 88 2.5-ton trucks and 36 various smaller vehicles. In actual combat, the 2.5 ton truck assigned as a prime mover often proved too conspicuous, so mortar crews sometimes used jeeps or mules to transport the mortar parts.

In July 1944, the 84th Chemical Mortar Battalion in Italy reorganized under the &quot;long ignored&quot; table of organization of September 1943. Lieutenant Colonel Ronald LeV. Martin of the 92nd Chemical Mortar Battalion received permission to eliminate one company of his battalion, anticipating future developments. In mid-1944, the War Department again revised the table of organization based upon the recommendations of Chemical Warfare Service officers with combat experience. One mortar company was eliminated to better fit with the three infantry regiments of the &quot;triangular&quot; infantry division, and the mortar companies were reorganized to have three platoons of four mortars each instead of two platoons of six mortars each. The strength of the battalion rose from 622 to 672, mainly because of the redesignation of the headquarters detachment of 63 men as a headquarters company with 155 men. Per Table of Organization and Equipment 3-25 of 29 September 1944, a typical chemical mortar battalion had an establishment of 37 officers, 138 NCOs and 481 junior enlisted men not counting the attached medical detachment. It consisted of:

* 1 chemical mortar battalion headquarters company, containing:
** 1 company headquarters section (4 officers, 4 noncommissioned officers, and 14 junior enlisted men)
** 1 battalion headquarters section (5 officers, 6 noncommissioned officers, and 20 junior enlisted men 
** 1 maintenance section (1 officer, 2 noncommissioned officers, and 6 junior enlisted men)
** 3 ammunition sections (each of 2 noncommissioned officers and 29 junior enlisted men)
* 3 chemical mortar companies
* Attached medical detachment (1 officer, 1 noncommissioned officer, and 13 junior enlisted men)

A chemical mortar company usually had an establishment of 9 officers, 40 noncommissioned officers and 118 junior enlisted men. It consisted of:
* 1 chemical mortar company headquarters section (three officers, seven noncommissioned officers, and 28 junior enlisted men)
* 3 mortar platoons

A mortar platoon consisted of:
* One platoon headquarters (two officers, three noncommissioned officers, and six junior enlisted men)
* Four mortar squads, each of which had one squad leader, (noncommissioned officer) one gunner, (noncommissioned officer) one assistant gunner, (junior enlisted man) three ammunition bearers, (junior enlisted men) and two truck drivers (junior enlisted men)
In November 1944, the 84th and 100th Chemical Mortar Battalions stationed in Italy reorganized under the table of organization of September 1944. Beginning in December 1944 and continuing into spring 1945, battalions in Europe reorganized under the new table of organization.

<text>Ardbraccan House (known sometimes historically as Ardbraccan Palace) is a large Palladian country house in the town of Ardbraccan, County Meath, Ireland. The historic house served from the 1770s to 1885 as the residence of the Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Meath.

==Construction==
Ardbraccan itself had been the location of the residence of a Catholic bishop for over one thousand years, first of the &quot;Bishop of Ardbraccan&quot; and, later, following the merger of many small dioceses into the Diocese of Meath, as the residence of the Bishop of Meath. By the Middle Ages a large Tudor house, containing its own church, known as &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, stood on the site. However, in 1734, Bishop Arthur Price (1678-1752) decided to replace the decaying mansion with a new Georgian residence. Initially the two wings of the house were built, before the main four-bay two-storey block of the house was completed in the 1770s by Bishop Maxwell. It was partly designed by the acclaimed 18th-century German architect Richard Castle (&quot;also known as Richard Cassels)&quot;, who was the architect of many notable Irish buildings including Leinster House in Dublin.

===Controversy/legend===
Legend suggested that gravestones from a neighbouring Catholic cemetery at Markiestown, some miles away, were removed and used as the steps into the servants&#x27; quarters in the residence. Whether that was an urban myth based on the intense rivalry between the state-established Church of Ireland and the local, predominantly Catholic, population in Bohermeen (who were subject to the discriminatory Penal Laws and forced to pay tithes to the Church of Ireland) or had some basis in fact, is unclear. It is possible that the house utilised stone from the derelict pre-Reformation church at the cemetery, though it was notable that from the mid to late eighteenth century the cemetery was denuded of &quot;all&quot; gravestones.

==Sale==
The new bishop&#x27;s palace became famous for its architecture. Funded by government grants and locally paid tithes, the Church of Ireland bishop held court from the mansion, which was the centre of a large agricultural demesne. However the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, following the previous scrapping of Roman Catholic-paid tithes, fatally weakened the economic survival of the bishop&#x27;s estate, which was left totally reliant on the small local Church of Ireland community, and in 1885 the bishop sold the estate and house, moving to a more suitable smaller mansion nearby named &quot;Bishopscourt&quot;. Ardbraccan House was bought by the eldest son of Hugh Law, a former Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and remained in the ownership of his descendants until sold by Colonel Owen Foster in 1985 to Tara Mines, who used it as a guest residence for visiting businessmen.

==Today==
In the late 1990s, the house was bought by David Maher who invested large sums to completely restore the mansion. In 2002 the restoration of Ardbraccan House won An Taisce&#x27;s &quot;Best Restoration of a Private Building&quot; award, and it was opened to the public.

In the early 2000s, the (Meath) planning authority approved controversial plans to build a major new motorway linking Clonee and Kells through part of the house&#x27;s historic demesne. The Irish Georgian Society and environmentalists criticised the proposal. The M3 motorway eventually opened in 2010.

In 2013 the property was sold to Charles Noell.

<doc id="396694" wikidata="Q190770" url="?curid=396694" title="Philip W. Anderson">
<text>Philip Warren Anderson (December 13, 1923 – March 29, 2020) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena. Anderson is also responsible for naming the field of physics that is now known as condensed matter physics.

==Education and early life==
Anderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. His father, Harry Warren Anderson, was a professor of plant pathology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; his maternal grandfather was a mathematician at Wabash College, where Anderson&#x27;s father studied; and his maternal uncle was a Rhodes Scholar who became a professor of English, also at Wabash College. He graduated from University Laboratory High School in Urbana in 1940. Under the encouragement of a math teacher by the name of Miles Hartley, Anderson enrolled at Harvard University to study under a fully-funded scholarship. He concentrated in &quot;Electronic Physics&quot; and completed his B.S. in 1943, after which he was drafted into the war effort and built antennas at the Naval Research Laboratory until the end of the Second World War in 1945. As an undergraduate, his close associates included particle-nuclear physicist H. Pierre Noyes, philosopher and historian of science Thomas Kuhn and molecular physicist Henry Silsbee. After the war, Anderson returned to Harvard to pursue graduate studies in physics under the mentorship of John Hasbrouck van Vleck; he received his Ph.D. in 1949 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;The theory of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the microwave and infrared regions.&quot;

==Career and research==
From 1949 to 1984, Anderson was employed by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics. During this period he developed what is now called Anderson localization (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system) and Anderson&#x27;s theorem (concerning impurity scattering in superconductors); invented the Anderson Hamiltonian, which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a transition metal; proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics (this played a role in the development of the Standard Model and the development of the theory behind the Higgs mechanism, which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles); created the pseudospin approach to the BCS theory of superconductivity; made seminal studies of non-s-wave pairing (both symmetry-breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of helium-3, and helped found the area of spin-glasses. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.

Anderson spent a year as lecturer at Cambridge University in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Brian Josephson in a class was &quot;a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, I can assure you, because everything had to be right or he would come up and explain it to me after class.&quot; 

From 1967 to 1975, Anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge. In 1977 Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers. Co-researchers Sir Nevill Francis Mott and John van Vleck shared the award with him. In 1982, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He retired from Bell Labs in 1984 and was Joseph Henry Professor Emeritus of Physics at Princeton University.

Anderson&#x27;s writings included &quot;Concepts in Solids&quot;, &quot;Basic Notions of Condensed Matter Physics&quot; and &quot;The Theory of Superconductivity in the High-Tc Cuprates&quot;. Anderson served on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government.

In response to the discovery of high-temperature superconductors in the 1980s, Anderson proposed Resonating valence bond (RVB) theory to explain the phenomenon. While many found the idea unconvincing, RVB theory proved instrumental in the study of spin liquids.

Anderson also made conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena, which became an inspiration for the science of complex systems. In 1972, he wrote an article called &quot;More is Different&quot; in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science, each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement.

In 1984, he participated in the founding workshops of the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research institute dedicated to the science of complex systems. Anderson also co-chaired the institute&#x27;s 1987 conference on economics with Kenneth Arrow and W. Brian Arthur, and participated in its 2007 workshop on models of emergent behavior in complex systems.

In 1987, Anderson testified to the US Congress, &quot;against the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), a 40 TeV proton-proton collider in Texas that would have been the biggest experiment in particle physics. Anderson&#x27;s opposition to the SSC did not directly lead to its cancellation in 1993—spiralling costs were the main factor—but he was perhaps its most high-profile opponent.&quot; He was, &quot;skeptical of the supposed boost it would provide to science in the US and the claim that the spin-offs would provide great return on investment.&quot;

A 2006 statistical analysis of scientific research papers by José Soler, comparing the number of references in a paper to the number of citations, declared Anderson to be the &quot;most creative&quot; amongst ten most cited physicists in the world. In 2021, Oxford University Press published the biography &quot;A Mind over Matter: Philip Anderson and the Physics of the Very Many&quot; by Andrew Zangwill.

==Awards and honors==
He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1978, was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1980, and was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1991. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1982.

==Personal life==
Anderson was an atheist and was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Anderson was also interested in Japanese culture, living there for a time and becoming a 1st Dan master of the board game Go. The Nihon Ki-in awarded him a lifetime achievement award in 2007, and Anderson joked that there were only four people in Japan who could beat him.

Anderson married Joyce Gothwaite in 1947 and they had a daughter, Susan. He died in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 29, 2020, at the age of 96.

<text>Christopher Edward Martin (born March 21, 1966), known professionally as DJ Premier (also known as Preemo), is an American record producer and DJ. He has been frequently lauded as one of hip hop&#x27;s greatest producers by publications such as &quot;Vibe&quot;. He formed the hip hop duo Gang Starr alongside American rapper Guru, with whom he has released seven albums. He formed another hip hop duo, PRhyme—with American rapper Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;—in 2014, with whom he has released two albums.

Premier has produced each of Gang Starr&#x27;s releases, as well as many of those by the Gang Starr Foundation. Alongside this, he has been credited with production work on releases for ASAP Mob, AZ, Common, Eminem, the Game, Griselda, Jeru the Damaja, J. Cole, Jay-Z, Joey Badass, Kanye West, Limp Bizkit, M.O.P., Mos Def, Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., O.C., Rakim, Royce Da 5&#x27;9, Run the Jewels, and Showbiz &amp; A.G., among others. Despite mainly working in underground hip hop, he has produced &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-charting singles including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man&quot; (2006) by Christina Aguilera, &quot;The Actual&quot; (1998) by All City, &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; (1994) and &quot;You Know My Steez&quot; (1997) by Gang Starr, &quot;MC&#x27;s Act Like They Don&#x27;t Know&quot; (1995) by KRS-One, and &quot;Nas Is Like&quot; (1999) by Nas.

Martin founded the record label, Year Round Records in 2010. He has signed acts including New York group NYGz, New Jersey rapper Nick Javas, and Houston rapper Khalil. &quot;Tha Blaqprint&quot; by Blaq Poet, which features 13 Premier productions, was released by Year Round Records through Fat Beats Records in June 2009.

== Early life ==
Christopher Edward Martin was born in Fifth Ward, Houston on March 21, 1966. He was then raised in Prairie View, before moving to Brooklyn, during his teenage years. He attended Prairie View A&amp;M University, where he honed his musical skills as the campus DJ, and he also occasionally performed with the Marching Storm band.

== Musical career ==
The early line-up of the Gang Starr Foundation in the mid-1990s included Jeru the Damaja, Group Home, Big Shug, and Gang Starr. Premier was fully responsible for the production of Jeru the Damaja&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;The Sun Rises in the East&quot; and &quot;Wrath of the Math&quot;. Jeru released three subsequent albums that did not include Premier&#x27;s involvement. In terms of his Group Home collaboration, Premier commented in a 2003 interview: &quot;They [Group Home] don&#x27;t respect what fed them.&quot; He further explained that he only agreed to produce the track &quot;The Legacy&quot; because of Guru&#x27;s involvement.

Other artists closely tied to the Gang Starr Foundation who Premier collaborated with include: Afu-Ra, Bahamadia, Krumbsnatcha, Big Shug, Smiley the Ghetto Child, and NYGz.

Premier collaborated with MC Jeru the Damaja on the album &quot;The Sun Rises in the East&quot;, released in 1994, as well as the 1996 follow-up, &quot;Wrath of the Math&quot;. Premier produced and supervised &quot;Livin&#x27; Proof&quot; by Group Home, also from the Gang Starr Foundation; although overlooked at the time of its 1995 release, the album eventually received acclaim. He produced several tracks on fellow Gang Starr Foundation member Afu-Ra&#x27;s debut album &quot;Body of the Life Force&quot; and KRS-One&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Return of the Boom Bap&quot;.

Besides the Gang Starr Foundation, Premier is closely affiliated with M.O.P., which he names as one of his all-time favorite groups. The relationship started with the remix of &quot;Rugged, Neva Smoove&quot; in 1994, a single from the group&#x27;s first album, which also included the exclusive B-side &quot;Downtown Swinga.&quot; From then, Premier produced about one-third of the songs on each subsequent album and overseeing and mixing the projects. On M.O.P.&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Foundation&quot; album, Premier provided only one track, which was called &quot;What I Wanna B.&quot;

In 2006, pop/R&amp;B singer Christina Aguilera recruited Premier to produce her album &quot;Back to Basics&quot;. Premier explained the reservations he heard from people regarding the collaboration:
When Christina [Aguilera] had me work with her, people were like, &quot;Oh no. Please don&#x27;t.&quot; Then, when they heard &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man,&quot; &quot;Back In The Day,&quot; and all the other records were still constructed like Premier tracks they were like, &quot;Yo, I really love this album. I was really impressed. I was worried, but you totally sound like what we love about you.&quot; Until you hear it, don&#x27;t say a word. I never want to be just attached to hip hop. I want to be attached to music—country, rap, soul, jazz, blues, it doesn&#x27;t matter, gospel music—I come from all of that.


In 2008, Premier appeared in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; as himself – the host for radio station The Classics 104.1.

Premier produced the majority of Blaq Poet&#x27;s &quot;Tha Blaqprint&quot;, which was released in mid-2009. Premier contributed a song on Game&#x27;s 2011 album, &quot;The R.E.D. Album&quot;. Also in 2011, Premier appeared on the song &quot;Gangster&quot;, on Bushido&#x27;s album &quot;Jenseits von Gut und Böse&quot;.

Premier was one of the artists followed in the 2012 documentary, &quot;Re:GENERATION&quot;. The film followed his production of the song &quot;Regeneration,&quot; for which he used a live performance of his work by the Berklee Symphony Orchestra.

In September 2012, Immortal Technique said that a song called &quot;Born in the Trap,&quot; on his upcoming album, titled &quot;The Middle Passage&quot;, would feature production by Premier.

In early 2014, Premier revealed that he was working with Aguilera again in an interview with New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot; magazine. Premier produced &quot;Y&#x27;all Ready Know&quot; by Slaughterhouse, from the Shady Records album, &quot;Shady XV&quot;, and the music video was published in November 2014.

In mid-2014, Premier collaborated with Korean hip-hop group Dynamic Duo on two singles &quot;AEAO&quot; and &quot;Animal&quot;, which were both warmly received.

A mid-January 2015 announcement from Premier stated that the producer&#x27;s studio, D&amp;D, also known as &quot;The HeadQcouterz,&quot; will cease to be operational and relocated to a recording space in Astoria, New York City, U.S. 

DJ Premier served as one of the three curators for the soundtrack to the video game &quot;NBA 2K16&quot;, alongside DJ Khaled and DJ Mustard.

On May 16, 2019, DJ Premier released a collaboration with Buffalo (New York) rappers Conway The Machine, Westside Gunn, and Benny the Butcher, called &quot;Headlines.&quot;

In June 2020, DJ Premier produced a track for Public Enemy called &quot;State of the Union (STFU)&quot;.

DJ Premier hosted a weekly two-hour show, &quot;Live From HeadQCourterz&quot;, on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s Shade 45. The show ended in 2022.

In August 2023, DJ Premier&#x27;s collaboration clothing collection with AMIRI was released, marked with &quot;PREEMO&quot; alongside the Amiri typography, with a record print.

== Style and influences ==

DJ Premier&#x27;s style of production epitomizes the New York sound of his earlier peers. He is known for sampling jazz, funk, and soul artists, as well as sampling an artist&#x27;s past work when creating a new track for that same artist. For example, on Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;So Ghetto&quot;, from the 1999 album &quot;Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter&quot;, Premier samples an older Jay-Z song, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Who You Wit II&quot;. In addition, his encyclopedic memory of hip-hop lyrics allows him to distinctively speak with his hands by scratching in lyrics from several different songs to construct new phrases. Premier&#x27;s beats are known for his oft-imitated combinations of short vocal samples, often from multiple artists, to create a chorus. Premier has also experimented with atonal samples that are not confined to soul, jazz, and funk. For example, he sampled and chopped up seminal electro-acoustic music from the 1960s on the track &quot;Physical Stamina&quot; by Jeru the Damaja.

In an interview with &quot;XXL Magazine&quot;, DJ Premier was asked how his sound evolved, to which he replied, &quot;Marley Marl is my number-one inspiration. Jam Master Jay, Mix Master Ice, and UTFO. Grandmaster D, and Whodini. DJ Cheese, Grandmaster Flash, Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa. Jazzy Jay—even Cut Creator. Seeing them do what they do. It&#x27;s black music, it&#x27;s black culture, it comes from the ghetto. How can you not relate to ghetto people when that&#x27;s the rawest form of blackness? Even though it&#x27;s not a good place in regards to the economy and how bad people have it in the neighborhood, the realism&#x27;s there, and that&#x27;s what we were born out of. So I very much pay respect by doing the same type of music in return.&quot; DJ Premier attended Prairie View A&amp;M University and may have been influenced by the musical atmosphere at the university while serving as the campus DJ and occasional performer with the world-famous Marching Storm band. He was a major progenitor of the boom-bap style of hip-hop production.

== Legacy ==
For its 20th-anniversary issue in 2008, &quot;The Source&quot; selected DJ Premier for its list of the 20 greatest producers in the magazine&#x27;s history. He also made the finals in &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2010 search for the greatest hip hop producer of all time—he finished second after Dr. Dre received 62 percent of the votes.

Afu Ra explained Premier&#x27;s influence in a September 2014 interview with the &quot;Lyrically Fit&quot; website:
Premier definitely coached me when I was in the booth. &quot;harder..stronger..more this..more that&quot;—I was an untamed artist and rapping next to recording your vocals are different. He gave me this knowledge through the work we did.

<text>Sir Nevill Francis Mott (30 September 1905 – 8 August 1996) was a British physicist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1977 for his work on the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, especially amorphous semiconductors. The award was shared with Philip W. Anderson and J. H. Van Vleck. The three had conducted loosely related research. Mott and Anderson clarified the reasons why magnetic or amorphous materials can sometimes be metallic and sometimes insulating.

== Education and early life ==
Mott was born in Leeds to Charles Francis Mott and Lilian Mary Reynolds, a granddaughter of Sir John Richardson, and great granddaughter of Sir John Henry Pelly, 1st Baronet. Miss Reynolds was a Cambridge Mathematics Tripos graduate and at Cambridge was the best woman mathematician of her year. His parents met in the Cavendish Laboratory, when both were engaged in physics research under J.J. Thomson.

Nevill grew up first in the village of Giggleswick, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father was Senior Science Master at Giggleswick School. His mother also taught Maths at the School. The family moved (due to his father&#x27;s jobs) first to Staffordshire, then to Chester and finally Liverpool, where his father had been appointed Director of Education. Mott was at first educated at home by his mother. At age ten, he began formal education at Clifton College in Bristol, followed by study at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read the Mathematics Tripos, supervised by R.H. Fowler.

== Career and research ==
Mott was appointed a Lecturer in the Physics Department at the University of Manchester in 1929. He returned to Cambridge in 1930 as a Fellow and lecturer of Gonville and Caius College, and in 1933 moved to the University of Bristol as Melville Wills Professor in Theoretical Physics.

In 1948 he became Henry Overton Wills Professor of Physics and Director of the Henry Herbert Wills Physical Laboratory at Bristol. In 1954 he was appointed Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge, a post he held until 1971. He was instrumental in the painful cancellation of the planned particle accelerator because of its very high cost. He also served as Master of Gonville and Caius College, 1959–1966.

His early works were on the theoretical analysis of collisions in gases, notably the collision with spin flip of an electron against a hydrogen atom, which would stimulate subsequent works by André Blandin and Jun Kondo about similar effects between conduction electrons, as well as magnetic properties in metals. This sort of activity led Mott to writing two books. The first one, which was edited together with Ian Sneddon, gives a simple and clear description of quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the Schrödinger equation in real space. The second describes atomic and electronic collisions in gases, using the rotational symmetry of electronic states in the Hartree–Fock method.

But already in the middle of the 1930s, Mott&#x27;s interests had broadened to include solid states, leading to two more books that would have a great impact on the development of the field in the years prior and after World War II. In 1936, &quot;Theory of the Properties of Metals and Alloys&quot; (written together with H. Jones) describes a simplified framework which led to rapid progress.

The concept of nearly free valence electrons in metallic alloys explained the special stability of the Hume-Rothery phases if the Fermi sphere of the &quot;sp&quot; valence electron, treated as free, would be scattered by the Brillouin zone boundaries of the atomic structure. The description of the impurities in metals by the Thomas Fermi approximation would explain why such impurities would not interact at long range. Finally the delocalisation of the valence &quot;d&quot; electrons in transitional metals and alloys would explain the possibility for the magnetic moments of atoms to be expressed as fractions of Bohr magnetons, leading to ferro or antiferromagnetic coupling at short range. This last contribution, produced at the first international conference on magnetism, held in Strasbourg in May 1939, reinforced similar points of view defended at the time in France by the future Nobel laureate Louis Néel. In 1949, Mott suggested to Jacques Friedel to use the approach developed together with Marvey for a more accurate description of the electric-field screening of the impurity in a metal, leading to the characteristic long range charge oscillations. Friedel also used the concept developed in that book of virtual bound level to describe a situation when the atomic potential considered is not quite strong enough to create a (real) bound level of symmetry e ≠ o. The consequences of these remarks on the more exact approaches of cohesion in rp as well as d metals were mostly developed by his students in Orsay.

The second book, with Ronald Wilfred Gurney, &quot;On the Physical Chemistry of Solids&quot; was more wide-ranging. It treated notably of the oxidation of metals at low temperatures, where it described the growth of the oxide layer as due to the electric field developed between the metal and absorbed oxygen ions, which could force the way of metallic or oxygen ions through a disordered oxide layer. The book also analysed the photographic reactions in ionic silver compound in terms of precipitation of silver ions into metallic clusters.

This second field had a direct and long lasting consequence on the research activity of John (Jack) Mitchell. Mott&#x27;s accomplishments include explaining theoretically the effect of light on a photographic emulsion (see latent image). His work on oxidation, besides fostering new research in the field (notably by J. Bénard and Nicolás Cabrera), was the root of the concept of the band gap produced in semiconductors by gradients in the distribution of donor and acceptor impurities.

During World War II, Mott joined the &quot;Army Cell&quot; of radar researchers. He was put in charge of getting the Army&#x27;s GL Mk. II radar working in the presence of serious calibration problems that caused the measurements to change as the antenna tracked its targets. He solved this problem by designing a large metal wire mat that was built around the radars to provide a very flat reference plane.

During the war Mott worked on the role of plastic deformation in the progression of fracture cracks. When he returned to Bristol after the war, his having met and hired Charles Frank enabled the two of them to make considerable advances in the study of dislocations, with the help of others such as Frank Nabarro and Alan Cottrell. Bristol became an important centre of research in this topic, especially at the end of the 1940s. If Mott only produced early and somewhat minor contributions to that field, notably on alloy hardening with Nabarro and on the topology of a dislocation network lowering the apparent elastic constants of a crystal, there is no doubt that Mott&#x27;s enthusiasm played its role in the three major steps forward in the field by Frank on crystal growth and plasticity and later, in Cambridge, by Peter Hirsch on thin film electron microscopy.

At the same time, however, Mott gave a lot of thought to electronic correlations and their possible role in Verwey&#x27;s compounds such as nickel oxides which could switch from metals to nonmetallic insulators under various physical conditions - this is known as the Mott transition. The term Mott insulator is also named for him, as well as the Mott polynomials, which he introduced.

=== Publications ===
N. F. Mott revived the old &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; and transformed it into a lively publication essentially centred on the then-new field of solid state physics, attracting writers, readers and general interest on a wide scale. After receiving a paper on point defects in crystals by Frederick Seitz that was obviously too long for the journal, Mott decided to create a new publication, Advances in Physics, for such review papers. Both publications are still active in 2017.

== Awards and honours ==
In 1977, Nevill Mott was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with Philip Warren Anderson and John Hasbrouck Van Vleck &quot;for their fundamental theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems.&quot; The news of having won the Nobel Prize received Mott while having lunch at restaurant &quot;Die Sonne&quot; in Marburg, Germany, during a visit to fellow solid state scientist at Marburg University.

Mott was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1936. Mott served as president of the Physical Society in 1957. In the early 1960s he was chairman of the British Pugwash group. He was knighted in 1962.

Mott received an honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1972.

In 1981, Mott became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

He continued to work until he was about ninety. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1995.

In 1995, Mott visited the Loughborough University Department of Physics and presented a lecture entitled &quot;65 Years in Physics&quot;. The University continues to host the annual Sir Nevill Mott Lecture.

== Personal life ==
Mott was married to Ruth Eleanor Horder, and had two daughters, Elizabeth and Alice. Alice was an educationist who worked with Claus Moser and married the mathematician Mike Crampin who was a Professor of Mathematics at The Open University. Neville Mott retired to live near the Crampins in Aspley Guise, Milton Keynes, where he died on 8 August 1996 at the age of 90. His autobiography, &quot;A Life in Science&quot;, was published in 1986 by Taylor &amp; Francis. His great grandfather was Sir John Richardson , the arctic explorer.

<text>The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche is an American stealth armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter designed for the United States Army. Following decades of study and development, the RAH-66 program was cancelled in 2004 before mass production began, by which point nearly US$7 billion had been spent on the program.

During the early 1980s, the U.S. Army started to formulate requirements for the replacement of its helicopters then in service, which resulted in the launch of the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program. Nearly a decade later, following the refinement of requirements, evaluation of submissions, and the rebranding of the program as the &quot;Light Helicopter&quot; (LH) program, during April 1991, the Army announced the selection of the Boeing–Sikorsky team&#x27;s design as the contest winner, shortly after which a contract for construction of prototypes was awarded. The Comanche was to incorporate several advanced elements, such as stealth technologies, and a number of previously untried design features. Operationally, it was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role, in which it was intended to designate targets for the AH-64 Apache. It was also armed with one rotary cannon and could carry missiles and rockets in internal bays and optionally on stub wings for light attack duties.

Two RAH-66 prototypes were constructed and underwent flight testing between 1996 and 2004. On 1 June 2000, the program entered its $3.1 billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase. However, during 2002, the Comanche program underwent heavy restructuring; the number of Comanches that were to be purchased was cut to 650. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. As early as the late 1990s, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had reported that it had &quot;serious doubts&quot; about the program, observing that the Comanche would &quot;consume almost two thirds of the whole Aviation budget by Fiscal Year 2008&quot;. Multiple government agencies had acted to cut the number of Comanches on order, but, as a consequence of the heavy reductions to the numbers to be procured, the unit costs soared.

On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army announced the termination of the Comanche program, stating they had determined that the RAH-66 would require numerous upgrades to be viable on the battlefield and that the service would instead direct the bulk of its rotary systems funds to renovating its existing attack, utility, and reconnaissance helicopters. The Army also announced new plans to accelerate the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the Comanche, but with less risk. Since program cancellation, both of the prototypes have been placed on public display.

==Development==

===Origins and LHX===
During 1982, the U.S. Army initiated the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program with the aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. Then in 1988 a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers; the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter by this time. In October 1988, the Army announced two teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to further develop their concepts. During the 1990s, the program&#x27;s name was changed from LHX to simply &quot;Light Helicopter&quot; (LH). In April 1991, the Army awarded the Boeing–Sikorsky team a $2.8 billion contract to complete six prototypes. Later that month the helicopter was officially named &quot;RAH-66 Comanche&quot;.

During November 1993, assembly of the first prototype commenced at Sikorsky&#x27;s facility in Stratford, Connecticut and at Boeing&#x27;s manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Later all of the rotorcraft&#x27;s sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In December 1994, the Department of Defense reduced the number of planned prototypes to two as the services shifted budgets to pay for increased troop salaries. On 25 May 1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky&#x27;s production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4 January 1996, the prototype Comanche, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The first flight had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed by a number of structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its first flight, before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter.

===Prototype testing===
The flight test program was conducted using the pair of prototypes produced, which had been assigned the serial numbers &quot;94-0327&quot; and &quot;95-0001&quot;. Following a demonstration of its ability to meet certain key criteria, on 1 June 2000, the RAH-66 entered the $3.1 billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the program. Through the early 2000s, the U.S. Army maintained its plans for the intended purchase of over 1,200 Comanches, which were to fill both the scout helicopter and light attack roles; as late as 2003, it was being anticipated that deliveries of operational RAH-66s would commence as scheduled during 2006.

During late 2000, it was revealed that an effort to reduce the Comanche&#x27;s empty weight by approximately or 2.1 percent in order to conform with its established target weight had been initiated. The first Comanche prototype, serial &quot;94-0327&quot;, completed 318 flights over 387 hours before reaching the end of its testing career during January 2002. The second prototype, serial &quot;95-0001&quot;, had accumulated 103.5 flight hours and 93 sorties by May 2001. During late 2001 and early 2002, testing with the second RAH-66 was halted while the aircraft underwent extensive modifications, received both mission equipment and more powerful T800-LHT-801 engines. On 23 May 2002, the second prototype re-commenced flight testing with the additional equipment fitted. Accordingly, the expanded test programme involved new aspects such as the testing of the armaments and night vision systems; these test flights continued into 2003. During testing, the Comanche was recorded as having attained a cruise speed of , as well as having achieved a &quot;dash speed&quot; of . It also demonstrated ability to perform a 180° turn in under five seconds.

During 2002, the Comanche program underwent heavy restructuring; consequently, the planned number of Comanches to be purchased was decreased to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, the EMD phase was to last for six years with five Comanches to be constructed for the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes. The initial production RAH-66s were to be completed in a Block I configuration that included the majority of the rotorcraft&#x27;s planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard with all of the planned capabilities.

===Cancellation===
On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army announced that they had decided to terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9 billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680 million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.

Subsequently, the Army decided to pursue development of another battlefield scout helicopter under the &quot;Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter&quot; program; this resulted in another rotorcraft, designated as the Bell ARH-70, being selected and developed with the intention to replace the OH-58D in place of the Comanche. However, on 16 October 2008, the Department of Defense notified Congress and Bell that it was canceling the program, reportedly due to cost overruns on its development.

A multitude of reasons contributed to the ultimate cancellation of the RAH-66 program. According to aviation author James Williams, efforts to speed up the program via the elimination of risk-mitigation measures and the stream of continuous adjustments to account for annual budget cuts to the rotorcraft resulted in the formation of a negative cycle that functioned to greatly extend the rotorcraft&#x27;s development schedule. Over the course of the Comanche&#x27;s development, multiple government agencies had acted to cut the number of helicopters that were intended to be ordered; one particularly common basis for such curtailments was that the Cold War had ended and thus such quantities were unnecessary (a phenomenon known as the &quot;peace dividend&quot;). However, significant reductions in volume directly resulted in the rapid climbs in the projections of the Comanche&#x27;s unit cost; in turn, this stimulated and gave validity to critics of the program, such as the Army Acquisition Executive James Ambrose, who had prominently declared that the Army would not receive any aircraft &quot;costing a dollar over $7.5 million&quot;.

As early as 1995, it is claimed by Williams that the Comanche had been facing complete cancellation as a choice between which defense development programs were to be scrapped. During mid-1999, the Comanche was subject to substantial governmental scrutiny; the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that it had &quot;serious doubts&quot; about the program and noted that the Comanche would &quot;consume almost two thirds of the whole Aviation budget by Fiscal Year 2008&quot;. In addition, wartime experiences, such as from the Kosovo War, had led to some senior figures within the Army to place a greater emphasis on the use of unmanned platforms for conducting many of the same roles for which the Comanche was being developed to perform. By 2000, Williams postulates that the primary reason for retaining the program was out of concern for the state of the helicopter industry—Sikorsky&#x27;s production and employment figures were at their lowest for decades and the contract was considered critical.

Author Fred Brooks criticized the program&#x27;s requirement for the Comanche to be capable of ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project&#x27;s design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche&#x27;s weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft&#x27;s final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche&#x27;s engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 percent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone for a number of years was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army&#x27;s aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less risky and more critical needs.

In a report published during 2008, the GAO recorded that an Army spokesperson had stated that &quot;the program&#x27;s costs could no longer be justified&quot;. Author Cindy Williams stated of the Comanche: &quot;The rationale for cutting Comanche... is twofold. First, the doctrinal niche that the Comanche occupies is unnecessary in the near term and probably not viable in the longer term. Secondly, as with all rotary-wing aircraft, the Comanche is a voracious consumer of strategic airlift.&quot;

The manufacturing team, Sikorsky and Boeing, have attributed factors that were outside of their control, such as budget cuts, &quot;requirement creep&quot;, and a protracted development period, to have caused problems with the program, rather than dysfunctionality on their part. Under the Comanche program, each company was responsible for the construction of different elements of the rotorcraft. Since the termination, both companies have decided to team up again to produce a jointly-developed prototype, designated as the SB-1 Defiant, for the Army&#x27;s Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program.

==Design==
The Comanche was intended to be an advanced armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter. The Comanche was specifically tailored to the role of armed scout to replace the U.S. Army&#x27;s OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, which is an upgraded version of a Vietnam War-era observation helicopter. It was both smaller and lighter than the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter that it had been intended to accompany. The RAH-66 was powered by a pair of LHTEC T800 turboshaft engines, each capable of generating up to 1,563 hp (1,165 kW) of power. The RAH-66&#x27;s fuselage was long and composed of composite materials; it was designed to be capable of fitting more readily onto transport ships, enabling the Comanche to be more rapidly deployed to flash points and other rapidly-developing situations. However, in the event of strategic transport assets not being available, the helicopter&#x27;s ferry range of would have allowed it to fly itself to battlefields overseas on its own.

As intended, it would have functioned as a stealth helicopter, incorporating a number of different techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; as a result of these combined measures, the Comanche&#x27;s RCS was stated to be 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache. The acoustic signature of the helicopter was also reported to be noticeably lower than that of comparable helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.

As intended, the Comanche was to be equipped with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have enabled operations at night and in inclement weather. Its primary mission was scouting using its advanced sensors, in particular locating and designating targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided with a pair of multi-functional LCDs in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS).

For the light attack role, the RAH-66 was to be furnished with various armaments. It was equipped with a single chin-mounted 20 mm three-barrel XM301 rotary cannon, which could be pointed rearwards and retracted under a fairing when not in use to decrease the helicopter&#x27;s radar cross-section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond storing munitions internally, the Comanche could also mount external stub wings to carry up to eight Hellfire missiles or sixteen Stinger missiles. However, operations performing with armaments mounted externally would reduce the effectiveness of the Comanche&#x27;s stealth technologies.

In 2001, the Army sought to procure a &quot;heavy attack&quot; variant of the Comanche, which was intended to begin replacing Apaches in 2025.

<doc id="396699" wikidata="Q3760605" url="?curid=396699" title="George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax">
<text>George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax (6 October 1716 – 8 June 1771) was a British statesman of the Georgian era. Due to his success in extending commerce in the Americas, he became known as the &quot;father of the colonies&quot;. President of the Board of Trade from 1748 to 1761, he aided the foundation of Nova Scotia, 1749, the capital Halifax being named after him. When Canada was ceded to the King of Great Britain by the King of France, following the Treaty of Paris of 1763, he restricted its boundaries and renamed it &quot;Province of Quebec&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of the 1st Earl of Halifax, he was styled Viscount Sunbury until succeeding his father as Earl of Halifax in 1739 (thus also styled in common usage Lord Halifax). Educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was married in 1741 to Anne Richards (died 1753), who had inherited a great fortune from Sir Thomas Dunk, whose name Halifax took.

==Career==
After having been an official in the household of Frederick, Prince of Wales, Halifax was made Master of the Buckhounds, and in 1748 he became President of the Board of Trade. While filling this position he helped to found Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, which was named after him, and he helped foster trade, especially with North America.

About this time he attempted, unsuccessfully, to become a Secretary of State, but was only allowed to enter the Cabinet in 1757. In March 1761, Halifax was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and during part of the time which he held this office he was also First Lord of the Admiralty.

He became Secretary of State for the Northern Department under Lord Bute in October 1762, switching to the Southern Department in 1763 and was one of the three ministers to whom King George III entrusted the direction of affairs during the premiership of George Grenville. In 1762, in search of evidence of sedition, he authorised a raid on the home of John Entick, declared unlawful in the case of &quot;Entick v. Carrington.&quot;

In 1763, he signed the general warrant for the &quot;authors, printers and publishers&quot; of &quot;The North Briton&quot; number 45, under which John Wilkes and 48 others were arrested, and for which, six years later, the courts of law made Halifax pay damages. 
He was also mainly responsible for the exclusion of the name of the King&#x27;s mother, Augusta, Princess of Wales, from the Regency Bill of 1765.

Together with his colleagues, Halifax left office in July 1765, returning to the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal under his nephew, Lord North, in January 1770. He had just been restored to his former position of Secretary of State when he died.

==Cricket==
Like his friends John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, Halifax was keen on cricket. The earliest surviving record of his involvement in the sport comes from 1741 when he led Northamptonshire in a match against Buckinghamshire at Cow Meadow in Northampton. In the same season, Sandwich and Halifax formed the Northamptonshire &amp; Huntingdonshire team which twice defeated Bedfordshire, first at Woburn Park and then at Cow Meadow.

==Legacy==

===Social, moral and cultural impact===
Halifax, who was Lord-Lieutenant of Northamptonshire and a Lieutenant General, was very extravagant. During the House of Commons election for Northampton in 1768, he spent £150,000 bribing voters to support his candidate, George Brydges Rodney, and was financially ruined by the effort.

He was a political patron of playwright and civil servant Richard Cumberland. He left no legitimate male children, and his titles became extinct on his death. Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, spoke slightingly of him and his mistress, Anna Maria Faulkner, including alleging that Halifax had &quot;sold every employment in his gift&quot;. His mistress had kept a low profile while he was in Ireland, but she was understood to have sold positions.

===Politics===
Halifax was opposed to slavery, and refused to invest his money in any cause that was linked to the TransAtlantic slave trade. There were numerous occasions in which colonists in North America came into conflict with Parliament, and on every one of those occasions he publicly voiced support for the colonists, thus leading to him becoming a popular figure in Britain&#x27;s North American colonies, including the Province of Massachusetts Bay, the Province of North Carolina and the Colony of Virginia. Halifax supported expanding the franchise so that a larger portion of people in the Kingdom of Great Britain would be able to vote in parliamentary elections. His mistress had kept a low profile while he was in Ireland, but she was alleged to have sold positions which was a political scandal for part of Halifax&#x27;s career.

===Memorials===
Halifax was buried in the parish church of Horton, Northamptonshire; an effigy bust and plaque features in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. An obelisk is erected at Chicksands Wood in the parish of Haynes, Bedfordshire, inscribed to his memory.

=== Collections ===
University College London holds over 4000 tracts in its Lansdowne and Halifax tracts collections, the latter being named after Halifax. The tracts were published in England between 1559 and 1776, and relate to the union between England and Scotland, the Civil War and the Restoration. Many of the tracts were written by Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift under pseudonyms.

===Related locations===
The municipality of Halifax and Halifax County, Nova Scotia, are named in his honour, as are the Halifax River in Central Florida; the town of Halifax and Halifax County, North Carolina; Halifax, Virginia, Halifax, Vermont in the United States; and Dunk Island in Queensland and Montague Island in New South Wales.

<text>Brewster is a ghost town in southwest Polk County, Florida, United States, ten miles south of Mulberry. It is at an elevation of 143 feet above sea level and has been uninhabited since the early 1960s. The population is 3, according to the 2010 Census.

The village of Brewster was founded in 1910 and for decades flourished from phosphate mining. It was largely a company town for American Cyanamid. The town had its own schools, movie theater, medical clinic, post office, which was established in 1913 and discontinued in 1961. 

The inventor of the digital computer, John Vincent Atanasoff, though born in Hamilton, New York, grew up in Brewster.

The village was officially closed down by the company in 1962. Much of Brewster was demolished at the time, but some abandoned buildings remain, including a smokestack which rises prominently in the area as a landmark. The deed to Brewster was turned over to the state of Florida in partial payment of a judgment against American Cyanamid for environmental damages.

<doc id="396703" wikidata="Q193655" url="?curid=396703" title="John Hasbrouck Van Vleck">
<text>John Hasbrouck Van Vleck (March 13, 1899 – October 27, 1980) was an American physicist and mathematician. He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977, for his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of electronic magnetism in solids.

==Early life and education==
Van Vleck was born to mathematician Edward Burr Van Vleck and Hester L. Raymond in Middletown, Connecticut, while his father was an assistant professor at Wesleyan University, and where his grandfather, astronomer John Monroe Van Vleck, was also a professor. He grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, and received an A.B. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1920, before earning his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1922 under the supervision of Edwin C. Kemble.

==Career and research==
He joined the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor in 1923, then moved to the University of Wisconsin before settling at Harvard. He also earned &quot;Honorary D. Sc.&quot;, or &quot;D. Honoris Causa&quot;, degree from Wesleyan University in 1936.

J. H. Van Vleck established the fundamentals of the quantum mechanical theory of magnetism, crystal field theory and ligand field theory (chemical bonding in metal complexes). He is regarded as the &quot;Father of Modern Magnetism&quot;.

During World War II, J. H. Van Vleck worked on radar at the MIT Radiation Lab. He was half time at the Radiation Lab and half time on the staff at Harvard. He showed that at about 1.25-centimeter wavelength water molecules in the atmosphere would lead to troublesome absorption and that at 0.5-centimeter wavelength there would be a similar absorption by oxygen molecules.
This was to have important consequences not just for military (and civil) radar systems but later for the new science of radioastronomy.
J. H. Van Vleck participated in the Manhattan Project. In June 1942, J. Robert Oppenheimer held a summer study for confirming the concept and feasibility of a nuclear weapon at the University of California, Berkeley. Eight theoretical scientists, including J. H. Van Vleck, attended it. From July to September, the theoretical study group examined and developed the principles of atomic bomb design.

J. H. Van Vleck&#x27;s theoretical work led to the establishment of the Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Laboratory. He also served on the Los Alamos Review committee in 1943. The committee, established by General Leslie Groves, also consisted of W. K. Lewis of MIT, Chairman; E. L. Rose, of Jones &amp; Lamson; E. B. Wilson of Harvard; and Richard C. Tolman, Vice Chairman of NDRC. The committee&#x27;s important contribution (originating with Rose) was a reduction in the size of the firing gun for the Little Boy atomic bomb, a concept that eliminated additional design weight and sped up production of the bomb for its eventual release over Hiroshima. However, it was not employed for the Fat Man bomb at Nagasaki, which relied on implosion of a plutonium shell to reach critical mass. 

The philosopher and historian of science Thomas Kuhn completed a Ph.D. in physics under Van Vleck&#x27;s supervision at Harvard.

From 1951, Van Vleck was Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard. He concurrently held the first deanship of Harvard&#x27;s Division of Engineering and Applied Physics until 1957.

In 1961/62 he was George Eastman Visiting Professor at University of Oxford and held a professorship at Balliol College.

In 1950 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966 and the Lorentz Medal in 1974.
For his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of electrons in magnetic solids, Van Vleck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1977, along with Philip W. Anderson and Sir Nevill Mott. Van Vleck transformations, Van Vleck paramagnetism and Van Vleck formula are named after him.

Van Vleck died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 81. He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery.

==Awards and honors==
Van Vleck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1935, and the American Philosophical Society in 1939. He was awarded the Irving Langmuir Award in 1965, the National Medal of Science in 1966 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1971, the Lorentz Medal in 1974 and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977.

==Personal life==
J. H. Van Vleck met Abigail Pearson, a student at University of Minnesota, during his professorship there, and married her on June 10, 1927. He and his wife Abigail were also important art collectors, particularly in the medium of Japanese woodblock prints (principally &quot;Ukiyo-e&quot;), known as &quot;Van Vleck Collection&quot;. It was inherited from his father Edward Burr Van Vleck. They donated the collection to the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison, Wisconsin in 1980s.

<text>Tuczno (, earlier &quot;Tietz&quot;) is a town and former pre-diocesan Catholic see in Wałcz County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship in northwestern Poland, with 2,014 inhabitants (2004).

It is the home of the restored Tuczno Castle, which is a popular place for conferences.

There is a Michael Jackson Street in Tuczno, the first of its kind in Poland.

== History ==

The first written evidence of Tuczno dates from year 1306. In 1338, Tuczno Castle was erected.

During the middle ages the town was variously controlled by Poland, Pomerania, Brandenburg (Neumark) and the State of the Teutonic Order. From 1466 (Second Peace of Thorn), when it was ceded by the Teutonic Order, Tuczno became definitively part of the Polish Poznań Voivodeship. From 1569 it was part of the Greater Poland province of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1772 it was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, becoming part of the Netze District, then the Province of West Prussia (Province of Prussia 1829–1878, then West Prussia again). In 1871 Prussia became part of the German Empire. After World War I it was part of the rump of West Prussia which remained with Weimar Germany – Posen-West Prussia – and was incorporated into the Province of Pomerania by the Nazis in 1938. It became part of Poland again in 1945 as part of the Recovered Territories.

== Landmarks ==
* Tuczno Castle
* Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary

== Ecclesiastical History ==
In 1923.05.01 was established the permanent Apostolic Administration of Tütz (German; Tuczno in Polish) on canonical territories split off from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Gniezno and Diocese of Chełmno, but when the Apostolic Administration (exempt) was promoted on 1930.08.13, it was also renamed after its new see, as Territorial Prelature of Schneidemühl (German; in 1945 renamed in Polish Piła).

<doc id="396718" wikidata="Q376141" url="?curid=396718" title="Borough of Halton">
<text>Halton () is a unitary authority area with borough status in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, North West England. The borough was created in 1974 and contains the towns of Runcorn and Widnes and the civil parishes of Daresbury, Hale, Halebank, Moore, Preston Brook, and Sandymoor. Since 1998, Halton Borough Council has been a unitary authority, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council. Since 2014, it has been part of the Liverpool City Region and a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

The neighbouring districts (clockwise from west) are Liverpool, Knowsley and St Helens, which are fellow boroughs of the Liverpool City Region, and Warrington and Cheshire West and Chester in Cheshire.

==History==

The River Mersey marks the boundary of the historic counties of Lancashire (to the north) and Cheshire (to the south). Before 1974, Widnes was administered by the Municipal Borough of Widnes in Lancashire, and Runcorn by Runcorn Urban District Council in Cheshire.

The 1969 Redcliffe-Maud Report recommended reforms to local government in England, including the abolition of all existing local government areas. They were to be replaced by mostly unitary authorities with the exception of three two-tier metropolitan areas to be called Merseyside, SELNEC (an acronym of South East Lancashire &amp; North East Cheshire), and West Midlands. Runcorn and Widnes would form part of the new Merseyside Metropolitan Area under a district called &#x27;St Helens-Widnes&#x27;.

The proposals were broadly accepted by the then Labour government but set aside by the incoming Conservative government following the 1970 general election which it had fought on a manifesto pledge to introduce a system of two-tier local government. The Local Government Act 1972 created new metropolitan counties around Liverpool (as Merseyside) and Manchester (as Greater Manchester) but Runcorn and Widnes would not be allocated to either. Instead, Widnes and Warrington would be moved into the non-metropolitan county of Cheshire, with Widnes joining Runcorn to create the new non-metropolitan district of Halton. The name of the new district was inspired by the ancient Barony of Halton which had possessed land on both sides of the river. The district was established on 1 April 1974. In addition to Runcorn Urban District and the Municipal Borough of Widnes, parts of Runcorn Rural District and the parish of Hale from Whiston Rural District were incorporated into Halton.

On 1 April 1998, Halton became a unitary authority, independent of Cheshire County Council. However, it continues to be served by Cheshire Police and Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, and forms part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes. On 1 April 2014, Halton became part of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, joining the local authorities of Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral, Knowsley and St Helens; the five metropolitan district councils which constitute the county of Merseyside. As a unitary authority, Halton&#x27;s status is similar to the metropolitan district councils.

In 1999, an historic Halton Transport bus was restored and gifted to the Czech Republic to mark the centenary of public transport in the city. Engineers from Halton have assisted with chemical decontamination in the city and also when the city flooded in 2002.

<doc id="396720" wikidata="Q2348767" url="?curid=396720" title="Henry Seymour Conway">
<text>Field Marshal Henry Seymour Conway (1721 – 9 July 1795) was a British general and statesman. A brother of the 1st Marquess of Hertford, and cousin of Horace Walpole, he began his military career in the War of the Austrian Succession. He held various political offices including Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Leader of the House of Commons and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. He eventually rose to the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.

==Family and education==
Conway was the second son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway (whose elder brother Popham Seymour-Conway had inherited the Conway estates) by his third wife, Charlotte Seymour-Conway (née Shorter). He entered Eton College in 1732 and from that time enjoyed a close friendship with his cousin Horace Walpole.

==Early army career==
Conway joined the Molesworth&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons on 27 June 1737 as a lieutenant. He was transferred to the 1st Foot Guards and was promoted to captain on 14 February 1741 and to captain-lieutenant (the equivalent of lieutenant colonel) on 10 May 1742.

During the War of Austrian Succession he served on the staff of Field Marshal George Wade at Dettingen in June 1743 and on the staff of the Duke of Cumberland at the Fontenoy in May 1745. Appointed colonel of the 48th Foot on 6 April 1746, he took part in Culloden later that month during the Jacobite Rebellion. His next battle, in July 1747, was at Lauffeld, in which he narrowly escaped death, being captured by the French but released on parole a few days later. In July 1749, he transferred from the 48th Foot to the 34th Foot, and served with his regiment in the garrison of Menorca in 1751.

==Early political career==
Conway was elected unopposed to the Irish House of Commons in 1741 for County Antrim, and to the British Parliament for Higham Ferrers in December 1741 on the recommendation of Sir Robert Walpole. He was elected in 1747 for Penryn and for St Mawes in 1754, both in the Boscawen interest. He was promoted to major-general on 12 March 1755.

In April 1755, he was unexpectedly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland by William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, the new Lord Lieutenant. He then finally took his seat for County Antrim in the Irish House of Commons in October 1755. It was hoped that he would resolve the conflict in Irish politics between the Speaker, Henry Boyle on the one side and George Stone, Archbishop of Armagh and John Ponsonby: ultimately, he reached a compromise, acceptable to the British Ministry, in which Boyle was bought off with an earldom and John Ponsonby became Speaker. He became a Groom of the Bedchamber in April 1757 to both George II and George III (until 1764).

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
Conway was the British military second in command on the Rochefort expedition in 1757, and repeatedly advocated an attack on Fort Fouras, but his colleagues would only agree a night attack (which failed). Ultimately the expedition returned to Portsmouth having achieved nothing. Though Mordaunt (the commander in chief) was acquitted by his court-martial, the affair damaged both their reputations. In his displeasure, George II refused to employ Conway on the 1758 campaigns. He was not employed again until the next reign, except that he was sent to sign a cartel for an exchange of prisoners at Sluys in 1759. On 21 April 1759 he became colonel of the 1st The Royal Dragoons and on 25 August 1759 he was promoted to lieutenant general.

In 1761, he served in Germany as deputy to John Manners, Marquess of Granby, the British commander in the army led by Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761 he commanded a corps which was at the centre of the line and not attacked. He was also present at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762, and captured the castle of Waldeck the following month. After peace preliminaries were signed at Fontainebleau in November, he supervised the embarkation of British troops from Europe, returning to England in March.

==Later political career==
Conway was re-elected to the House of Commons in April 1761, this time for Thetford and on 4 July 1761 he became a member of the Privy Council. having been previously appointed as a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1755. As a senior member of the Rockingham faction of the Whigs, he opposed the King&#x27;s legal actions against the reformist John Wilkes in 1763 which resulted in his dismissal in 1764 as a Groom of the Bedchamber and as Colonel of the 1st Royal Dragoons. This led to the publication of accusation and counter-accusation in pamphlets, as it was feared that the government intended to purge the army of its political opponents.

He entered office with Lord Rockingham as Secretary of State for the Southern Department in July 1765 before switching to the Northern Department in May 1766, serving until January 1768, when he became a Minister without Portfolio. In these offices, Conway sought to urge a moderate policy towards the American colonies, being the principal supporter of the repeal of the Stamp Act, and opposing the taxation policies of Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend.

==Return to the Army==
Following his resignation in January 1768, Conway returned to the military, and was made a full general on 26 May 1772 and Governor of Jersey on 22 October 1772. He remained an important figure in the Commons, opposing the British attempt to suppress the American Revolt. He was rewarded with a cabinet position and the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the new Rockingham ministry in March 1782. His political career came to an end in 1784 when he lost his seat in parliament due to his opposition to the new government of William Pitt and he focused thereafter on his military responsibilities retaining his post as Commander-in Chief until his complete retirement in January 1793. He was promoted to field marshal on 18 October 1793 and died, at his home, Park Place at Remenham in Berkshire, on 9 July 1795.

==Family==
On 19 December 1747 he married Caroline, the widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury, and daughter of Lieutenant-General John Campbell, later the 4th Duke of Argyll. They had one daughter, the sculptor Anne Seymour Damer.

<text>Sheldon Lee Glashow (, ; born December 5, 1932) is a Nobel Prize-winning American theoretical physicist. He is the Metcalf Professor of Mathematics and Physics at Boston University, and a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics, emeritus, at Harvard University. Glashow is a member of the board of sponsors for the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;.

==Birth and education==
Sheldon Glashow was born on December 5, 1932, in New York City, to Jewish immigrants from Russia, Bella (née Rubin) and Lewis Gluchovsky, a plumber. He graduated from Bronx High School of Science in 1950. Glashow was in the same graduating class as Steven Weinberg, whose own research, independent of Glashow&#x27;s, would result in Glashow, Weinberg, and Abdus Salam sharing the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics (see below). Glashow received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1954 and a PhD degree in physics from Harvard University in 1959 under Nobel-laureate physicist Julian Schwinger. Afterwards, Glashow became a NSF fellow at NORDITA and met Murray Gell-Mann, who convinced him to become a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. Glashow then became an assistant professor at Stanford University before joining the University of California, Berkeley where he was an associate professor from 1962 to 1966. He joined the Harvard physics department as a professor in 1966, and was named Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics in 1979; he became emeritus in 2000. Glashow has been a visiting scientist at CERN, and professor at Aix-Marseille University, MIT, Brookhaven Laboratory, Texas A&amp;M, the University of Houston, and Boston University.

==Research==
In 1961, Glashow extended electroweak unification models due to Schwinger by including a short range neutral current, the Z0. The resulting symmetry structure that Glashow proposed, SU(2) × U(1), forms the basis of the accepted theory of the electroweak interactions. For this discovery, Glashow along with Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam, was awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In collaboration with James Bjorken, Glashow was the first to predict a fourth quark, the charm quark, in 1964. This was at a time when 4 leptons had been discovered but only 3 quarks proposed. The development of their work in 1970, the GIM mechanism showed that the two quark pairs: (d.s), (u,c), would largely cancel out flavor changing neutral currents, which had been observed experimentally at far lower levels than theoretically predicted on the basis of 3 quarks only. The prediction of the charm quark also removed a technical disaster for any quantum field theory with unequal numbers of quarks and leptons — an anomaly — where classical field theory symmetries fail to carry over into the quantum theory.

In 1973, Glashow and Howard Georgi proposed the first grand unified theory. They discovered how to fit the gauge forces in the standard model into an SU(5) Lie group group, and the quarks and leptons into two simple representations. Their theory qualitatively predicted the general pattern of coupling constant running, with plausible assumptions, it gave rough mass ratio values between third generation leptons and quarks, and it was the first indication that the law of Baryon number is inexact, that the proton is unstable. This work was the foundation for all future unifying work.

Glashow shared the 1977 J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize with Feza Gürsey.

==Criticism of superstring theory==
Glashow is a skeptic of superstring theory due to its lack of experimentally testable predictions. He had campaigned to keep string theorists out of the Harvard physics department, though the campaign failed. About ten minutes into &quot;String&#x27;s the Thing&quot;, the second episode of &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; TV series, he describes superstring theory as a discipline distinct from physics, saying &quot;...you may call it a tumor, if you will...&quot;.

==Personal life==
Glashow is married to Joan Shirley Alexander. They have four children. Lynn Margulis was Joan&#x27;s sister, making Carl Sagan his former brother-in-law. Daniel Kleitman, who was another doctoral student of Julian Schwinger, is also his brother-in-law, through Joan&#x27;s other sister, Sharon.

In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Glashow has described himself as a &quot;practising atheist&quot; and a Democrat.

Glashow is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

<text>Halton is a small village and civil parish in the Buckinghamshire district of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England, located about two miles north of Wendover and five miles southeast of Aylesbury.

==History and development==
Medieval Halton was held by the monastery of Christchurch, Canterbury, along with Monks Risborough, and after the Reformation, passed to the Bradshawe family of Wendover and later to the Fermor family. In 1720, James Fermor sold the estate to Sir Francis Dashwood of West Wycombe. It remained in the Dashwood&#x27;s ownership until Baron Lionel de Rothschild acquired the estate in 1851.

In the Chiltern Hills above Halton is Halton House, a country house in the style of a French chateau, which is currently used as the main Officers&#x27; Mess for RAF Halton. It was originally built for Alfred de Rothschild in 1880. The RAF demolished its domed winter garden to build an accommodation block.

Halton lies just outside the Metropolitan Green Belt so it has not been protected from postwar housing development. At its southern end it is contiguous with Wendover, but it retains a separate, older village centre anchored by St Michael &amp; All Angels Church, which dates from 1813, built on the site of a 16th-century church, and a community hall. There is a separate, modern Catholic Church.

The Parish also includes RAF Halton, a Royal Air Force (RAF) training station with a grass airfield used for glider training. Most modern housing in the village was built for RAF personnel, but some is now in private hands. A small shop mainly serves the RAF community. The base had a large military hospital employing hundreds of people, which was closed in 1995. The buildings remained until 2007/8 when they were demolished for the Princess Mary Gate housing scheme on land between Halton and Wendover.

==Facilities==
Halton Community Combined School is a mixed primary school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has 91 pupils and was recently (Mar 2011) judged &#x27;excellent&#x27; by OFSTED, despite having 70% of its pupils from Forces backgrounds who move frequently. 
The Halton Tennis Centre has a small number of future athletes combining competitive tennis training with home schooling. The centre was formerly run by the RAF, who still train there. The school also contains Halton Preschool, which is a mixed preschool, which takes children from 2 to 4 in classes of 15 to 30.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is Wendover, on the Chiltern Railways line between Aylesbury and London Marylebone (via Amersham). Journey times to London are under an hour. A single track railway line used to run from Halton, crossing the A413 by way of a level crossing, to a bay platform at the north end of Wendover station.

Route 8 is served by Arriva and is a bus from and to the Main Point at RAF Halton.

The Wendover arm of the Grand Union Canal flows through Halton on its course from Wendover to join the Grand Union beside Marsworth lock near Tring.

==Popular culture==
Halton gave its name to the Handley Page Halton, a cargo version of the Halifax bomber.

<doc id="396723" wikidata="Q2517710" url="?curid=396723" title="Diseconomies of scale">
<text>In microeconomics, diseconomies of scale are the cost disadvantages that economic actors accrue due to an increase in organizational size or in output, resulting in production of goods and services at increased per-unit costs. The concept of diseconomies of scale is the opposite of economies of scale. It occurs when economies of scale become dysfunctional for a firm. In business, diseconomies of scale are the features that lead to an increase in average costs as a business grows beyond a certain size.
==Causes==

===Communication costs===
Ideally, all employees of a firm would have one-on-one communication with each other so they know exactly what the other workers are doing. A firm with a single worker does not require any communication between employees. A firm with two workers requires one communication channel, directly between those two workers. A firm with three workers requires three communication channels between employees (between employees A &amp; B, B &amp; C, and A &amp; C). Here is a chart of one-on-one communication channels required:
The graph of all one-on-one channels is a complete graph.

The number of one-on-one channels of communication grows more rapidly than the number of workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.

===Duplication of effort===
An organisation with just one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, there could be some duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, it is inevitable that someone, or even a team, will take on a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as &quot;one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing&quot;. General Motors, for example, developed two in-house CAD/CAM systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used CADAM, UNIGRAPHICS, CATIA and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.

===Office politics===
&quot;Office politics&quot; is management behavior which a manager knows is counter to the best interest of the company, but is in their personal best interest. For example, a manager might intentionally promote an incompetent worker, knowing that the worker will never be able to compete for the manager&#x27;s job. This type of behavior only makes sense in a company with multiple levels of management. The more levels there are, the more opportunity for this behavior. In a small company, such behavior could cause the company to go bankrupt, and thus cost the manager their job, so they would not make such a decision. In a large company, one manager would not have much effect on the overall health of the company, so such &quot;office politics&quot; are in the interest of individual managers.

===Top-heavy companies===
As an organisation increases in size, it becomes costly to keep control of a sprawling corporate empire, and this often results in bureaucracy as executives implement more and more levels of management. As firms increase in size, managers will initially provide a net benefit to the firm and increase productivity; however, as a firm grows and covers a larger geographical area and/or employs more people, a principal–agent problem arises, leading to lower productivity. To counter this, executives introduce standards and controls in order to maintain productivity, and this necessitates the hiring of more managers to apply these standards and controls, hence the proportion of managerial to working class begins to lean towards managerial and the company becomes &quot;top-heavy&quot;. However, these additional managers are not providing additional output: they are spending their time implementing standards and carrying out supervision that is unnecessary in smaller firms, hence the cost-per-unit has increased.

===Supply-chain disruption===
Global emergencies, such as COVID-19 in 2020, can easily disrupt supply chains. This disruption has a higher chance of affecting large organizations - especially when there are only a few large suppliers. Smaller organizations with robust, local supply networks can manage supply chain shocks because any localized shock has a smaller effect on the overall ecosystem.

==Other effects which reduce competitiveness of large firms==

These do not always increase the cost-per-unit, but do reduce the ability of a large firm to compete.

===Cannibalization===

A small firm only competes with other firms, but larger firms frequently find their own products are competing with each other. A Buick was just as likely to steal customers from another GM make, such as an Oldsmobile, as it was to steal customers from other companies. This may help to explain why Oldsmobiles were discontinued after 2004. This self-competition wastes resources that should be used to compete with other firms.

===Isolation of decision-makers from the results of their decisions===

If a single person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know on the same day whether their decision was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision is embraced by consumers or if it is rejected, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved on to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.

===Slow response time===

In a reverse example, the smaller firm will know immediately if people begin to request other products, and be able to respond the next day. A large company would need to do research, create an assembly line, determine which distribution chains to use, plan an advertising campaign, etc., before any changes could be made. By this time, the smaller competitors may well have grabbed that market niche.

===Inertia (Unwillingness to change)===

This will be defined as the &quot;we&#x27;ve always done it that way, so there&#x27;s no need to ever change&quot; attitude (see appeal to tradition). An old, successful company is far more likely to have this attitude than a new, struggling one. While &quot;change for change&#x27;s sake&quot; is counter-productive, refusal to consider change, even when indicated, is likewise toxic to a company, as changes in the industry and market conditions will inevitably demand changes in the firm in order to remain successful. An example is Polaroid Corporation&#x27;s delay in moving into digital imaging, which adversely affected the company, ultimately leading to bankruptcy.

===Public and government opposition===

Such opposition is largely a function of the size of the firm. Behavior from Microsoft, which would have been ignored from a smaller firm, was seen as an anti-competitive and monopolistic threat, due to Microsoft&#x27;s size, thus bringing about government lawsuits.

===Large market share===

A small company with only a 1% market share could relatively easily double market share, and hence revenues, in a year. A large company with 50% market share will find it difficult to do so.

===Large market portfolio===

A small investment fund can potentially yield a higher return because it can concentrate its investments in a small number of good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large investment fund must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the results will be closer to market average.

===Inelasticity of supply===

A company which is heavily dependent on a resource supply of a fixed or relatively-fixed size will have trouble increasing production. For instance, a timber company cannot increase production above the sustainable harvest rate of its land (although it can still increase production by acquiring more land). Similarly, service companies are limited by available labor (and thus tend to concentrate in large, densely-populated metropolitan areas); STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professions are often-cited examples.

===Reputation===

Larger firms have a reputation to uphold and as a result may place more restrictions on employees, limiting their efficiency. This will be seen amplified in a regulated industry, where a company losing its license would be an extremely serious event.

===Other effects related to size===

Large firms also tend to be old and in mature markets. Both of these have negative implications for future growth. Old firms tend to have a large retiree base, with high associated pension and health costs, and may be unionized, with associated higher salaries and labor rights. Mature markets tend to only offer the potential for small, incremental growth. (Everybody might go out and buy a new invention next year, but it is unlikely they will all buy cars next year, since most people already have them.)

===Impact on smaller firms===
While diseconomies of scale are typically associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean has observed that this can occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising variable costs along with rapidly rising overheads.

==Solutions==
Solutions to the diseconomies of scale for large firms may involve splitting the company into smaller organisations. This can either happen by default when the company is in financial difficulties, sells off its profitable divisions and shuts down the rest; or can happen proactively, if the management is willing.

To avoid the negative effects of diseconomies of scale, a firm must stick to the lowest average output cost and try to recognise any external diseconomies of scale. Moreover, on reaching the lowest average cost, a firm must either expand to other countries to increase demand for its products, or seek new markets or produce new products that do not compete with its original products. However, neither of these actions will necessarily eliminate communications and management problems often associated with large organisations.

A systematic analysis and redesign of business processes, in order to reduce complexity, can counter diseconomies of scale. (Of course, this phase of analysis and revamping in itself can be, and usually is, a diseconomy leading to hiring of new personnel and investment in new, competing systems.) This leads to increased productivity. Improved management systems and more effective control of labor and operations can lower overhead.

===Example===

Returning to the example of the large donut firm, each retail location could be allowed to operate relatively autonomously from the company headquarters.

For instance, the local management may decide on the following factors instead of relying on the central management:
# Employee decisions such as hiring, firing, promotions and wage scales, where the local management is directly involved and likely to have better understanding of each employee. For instance, employers may choose to offer higher wages and charge higher prices if they are in an affluent area.
# Purchasing decisions, with each location allowed to choose its own suppliers, which may or may not be owned by the corporation (wherever they find the best quality and prices).
# Research and marketing decisions. Each firm may decide to develop their own recipes or utilise different signature flavour unique to their locale. For instance, when fresh apple cider is available at bargain prices from local farmers in October, they may choose to market a cinnamon donut and hot apple cider combo.
While a single, large, centrally-controlled firm may have higher ability to innovate and develop or market new products more effectively than when its resources are divided, it may lack the flexibility to offer individual customizations. Allowing the different retail locations to make decisions independent of the central management may allow them to meet local consumers&#x27; demands more efficiently.

In addition, if the employees own a portion of the local business, employees will also have a more vested interest in its success.

Note that all these changes will likely result in a substantial reduction in corporate headquarters staff and other support staff. For this reason, many businesses delay such a reorganization until it is too late to be effective. However, the whole company incurs reputation and legal risks arising from each unit.

==Criticism==

The empirical validity of diseconomies of scale as a rule of thumb has been criticised in recent years, following the increasing concentration of transnational corporations on the global level. The Cambridge economist Peter Nolan calculated that in almost all global production sectors, transnational corporations had merged and concentrated since the 1980s instead of succumbing to diseconomies of scale, leading to significant market power concentration and oligopolistic competition on the global level. This criticism suggests that earlier concerns on diseconomies of scale, e.g. voiced by Alfred Marshall, are increasingly invalid, as improvements to global supply chains, communication technology and reduction of transport costs allow benefits of scale (e.g. concentration of spending on R&amp;D and market power) to trump diseconomies of scale.

<doc id="396724" wikidata="Q6740853" url="?curid=396724" title="Amyloid">
<text>Amyloids are aggregates of proteins characterised by a fibrillar morphology of typically 7–13 nm in diameter, a β-sheet secondary structure (known as cross-β) and ability to be stained by particular dyes, such as Congo red. In the human body, amyloids have been linked to the development of various diseases. Pathogenic amyloids form when previously healthy proteins lose their normal structure and physiological functions (misfolding) and form fibrous deposits within and around cells. These protein misfolding and deposition processes disrupt the healthy function of tissues and organs.

Such amyloids have been associated with (but not necessarily as the cause of) more than 50 human diseases, known as amyloidosis, and may play a role in some neurodegenerative diseases. Some of these diseases are mainly sporadic and only a few cases are familial. Others are only familial. Some result from medical treatment. Prions are an infectious form of amyloids that can act as a template to convert other non-infectious forms. Amyloids may also have normal biological functions; for example, in the formation of fimbriae in some genera of bacteria, transmission of epigenetic traits in fungi, as well as pigment deposition and hormone release in humans.

Amyloids have been known to arise from many different proteins. These polypeptide chains generally form β-sheet structures that aggregate into long fibers; however, identical polypeptides can fold into multiple distinct amyloid conformations. The diversity of the conformations may have led to different forms of the prion diseases.

An unusual secondary structure named α sheet has been proposed as the toxic constituent of amyloid precursor proteins, but this idea is not widely accepted at present.

==Definition==
The name &quot;amyloid&quot; comes from the early mistaken identification by Rudolf Virchow of the substance as starch ( in Latin, from ), based on crude iodine-staining techniques. For a period, the scientific community debated whether or not amyloid deposits are fatty deposits or carbohydrate deposits until it was finally found (in 1859) that they are, in fact, deposits of albumoid proteinaceous material.
* The classical, histopathological definition of amyloid is an extracellular, proteinaceous fibrillar deposit exhibiting β-sheet secondary structure and identified by apple-green birefringence when stained with congo red under polarized light. These deposits often recruit various sugars and other components such as serum amyloid P component, resulting in complex, and sometimes inhomogeneous structures. Recently this definition has come into question as some classic, amyloid species have been observed in distinctly intracellular locations.
* A more recent, &quot;biophysical&quot; definition is broader, including any polypeptide that polymerizes to form a cross-β structure, &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot;, inside or outside cells. Microbiologists, biochemists, biophysicists, chemists and physicists have largely adopted this definition, leading to some conflict in the biological community over an issue of language.

==Proteins forming amyloids in diseases==
To date, 37 human proteins have been found to form amyloid in pathology and be associated with well-defined diseases. The International Society of Amyloidosis classifies amyloid fibrils and their associated diseases based upon associated proteins (for example ATTR is the group of diseases and associated fibrils formed by TTR). A table is included below.

==Non-disease and functional amyloids==
Many examples of non-pathological amyloid with a well-defined physiological role have been identified in various organisms, including human. These may be termed as functional or physiological or native amyloid.
* Functional amyloid in Homo sapiens:
** Intralumenal domain of melanocyte protein PMEL
** Peptide/protein hormones stored as amyloids within endocrine secretory granules
** Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1/3 (RIP1/RIP3)
** Fragments of prostatic acid phosphatase and semenogelins
* Functional amyloid in other organisms:
** Curli fibrils produced by &quot;E. coli,&quot; &quot;Salmonella, &quot;and a few other members of the Enterobacteriales (Csg). The genetic elements (operons) encoding the curli system are phylogenetic widespread and can be found in at least four bacterial phyla. This suggest that many more bacteria may express curli fibrils.
** GvpA, forming the walls of particular Gas vesicles, i.e. the buoyancy organelles of aquatic archaea and eubacteria
** Fap fibrils in various species of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;
** Chaplins from &quot;Streptomyces coelicolor&quot;
** Spidroin from &quot;Trichonephila edulis&quot; (spider) (Spider silk)
** Hydrophobins from Neurospora crassa and other fungi
** Fungal cell adhesion proteins forming cell surface amyloid regions with greatly increased binding strength
** Environmental biofilms according to staining with amyloid specific dyes and antibodies.
** Tubular sheaths encasing Methanosaeta thermophila filaments
* Functional amyloid acting as prions
** Several yeast prions are based on an infectious amyloid, e.g. [PSI+] (Sup35p); [URE3] (Ure2p); [PIN+] or [RNQ+] (Rnq1p); [SWI1+] (Swi1p) and [OCT8+] (Cyc8p)
** Prion HET-s from &quot;Podospora anserina&quot;
** Neuron-specific isoform of CPEB from &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; (marine snail)

== Structure ==
Amyloids are formed of long unbranched fibers that are characterized by an extended β-sheet secondary structure in which individual β strands (β-strands) (coloured arrows in the adjacent figure) are arranged in an orientation perpendicular to the long axis of the fiber. Such a structure is known as cross-β structure. Each individual fiber may be 7–13 nanometres in width and a few micrometres in length. The main hallmarks recognised by different disciplines to classify protein aggregates as amyloid is the presence of a fibrillar morphology with the expected diameter, detected using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM), the presence of a cross-β secondary structure, determined with circular dichroism, FTIR, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), X-ray crystallography, or X-ray fiber diffraction (often considered the &quot;gold-standard&quot; test to see whether a structure contains cross-β fibres), and an ability to stain with specific dyes, such as Congo red, thioflavin T or thioflavin S.

The term &quot;cross-β&quot; was based on the observation of two sets of diffraction lines, one longitudinal and one transverse, that form a characteristic &quot;cross&quot; pattern. There are two characteristic scattering diffraction signals produced at 4.7 and 10 Å (0.47 nm and 1.0 nm), corresponding to the interstrand and stacking distances in β sheets. The &quot;stacks&quot; of β sheet are short and traverse the breadth of the amyloid fibril; the length of the amyloid fibril is built by aligned β-strands. The cross-β pattern is considered a diagnostic hallmark of amyloid structure.

Amyloid fibrils are generally composed of 1–8 protofilaments (one protofilament also corresponding to a fibril is shown in the figure), each 2–7 nm in diameter, that interact laterally as flat ribbons that maintain the height of 2–7 nm (that of a single protofilament) and are up to 30 nm wide; more often protofilaments twist around each other to form the typically 7–13 nm wide fibrils. Each protofilament possesses the typical cross-β structure and may be formed by 1–6 β-sheets (six are shown in the figure) stacked on each other. Each individual protein molecule can contribute one to several β-strands in each protofilament and the strands can be arranged in antiparallel β-sheets, but more often in parallel β-sheets. Only a fraction of the polypeptide chain is in a β-strand conformation in the fibrils, the remainder forms structured or unstructured loops or tails.

For a long time our knowledge of the atomic-level structure of amyloid fibrils was limited by the fact that they are unsuitable for the most traditional methods for studying protein structures. Recent years have seen progress in experimental methods, including solid-state NMR spectroscopy and Cryo-Electron Microscopy. Combined, these methods have provided 3D atomic structures of amyloid fibrils formed by amyloid β peptides, α-synuclein, tau, and the FUS protein, associated with various neurodegenerative diseases.

X-ray diffraction studies of microcrystals revealed atomistic details of core region of amyloid, although only for simplified peptides having a length remarkably shorter than that of peptides or proteins involved in disease. The crystallographic structures show that short stretches from amyloid-prone regions of amyloidogenic proteins run perpendicular to the filament axis, consistent with the &quot;cross-β&quot; feature of amyloid structure. They also reveal a number of characteristics of amyloid structures – neighboring β-sheets are tightly packed together via an interface devoid of water (therefore referred to as dry interface), with the opposing β-strands slightly offset from each other such that their side-chains interdigitate. This compact dehydrated interface created was termed a steric-zipper interface. There are eight theoretical classes of steric-zipper interfaces, dictated by the directionality of the β-sheets (parallel and anti-parallel) and symmetry between adjacent β-sheets. A limitation of X-ray crystallography for solving amyloid structure is represented by the need to form microcrystals, which can be achieved only with peptides shorter than those associated with disease.

Although bona fide amyloid structures always are based on intermolecular β-sheets, different types of &quot;higher order&quot; tertiary folds have been observed or proposed. The β-sheets may form a β-sandwich, or a β-solenoid which may be either β-helix or β-roll. Native-like amyloid fibrils in which native β-sheet containing proteins maintain their native-like structure in the fibrils have also been proposed. There are few developed ideas on how the complex backbone topologies of disulfide-constrained proteins, which are prone to form amyloid fibrils (such as insulin and lysozyme), adopt the amyloid β-sheet motif. The presence of multiple constraints significantly reduces the accessible conformational space, making computational simulations of amyloid structures more feasible. 

One complicating factor in studies of amyloidogenic polypeptides is that identical polypeptides can fold into multiple distinct amyloid conformations. This phenomenon is typically described as &quot;amyloid polymorphism&quot;.
 It has notable biological consequences given that it is thought to explain the prion strain phenomenon.

== Formation ==

Amyloid is formed through the polymerization of hundreds to thousands of monomeric peptides or proteins into long fibers. Amyloid formation involves a &quot;lag phase&quot; (also called &quot;nucleation phase&quot;), an &quot;exponential phase&quot; (also called &quot;growth phase&quot;) and a &quot;plateau phase&quot; (also called &quot;saturation phase&quot;), as shown in the figure. Indeed, when the quantity of fibrils is plotted versus time, a sigmoidal time course is observed reflecting the three distinct phases.

In the simplest model of &#x27;nucleated polymerization&#x27; (marked by red arrows in the figure below), individual unfolded or partially unfolded polypeptide chains (monomers) convert into a nucleus (monomer or oligomer) via a thermodynamically unfavourable process that occurs early in the lag phase. Fibrils grow subsequently from these nuclei through the addition of monomers in the exponential phase.

A different model, called &#x27;nucleated conformational conversion&#x27; and marked by blue arrows in the figure below, was introduced later on to fit some experimental observations: monomers have often been found to convert rapidly into misfolded and highly disorganized oligomers distinct from nuclei. Only later on, will these aggregates reorganise structurally into nuclei, on which other disorganised oligomers will add and reorganise through a templating or induced-fit mechanism (this &#x27;nucleated conformational conversion&#x27; model), eventually forming fibrils.

Normally folded proteins have to unfold partially before aggregation can take place through one of these mechanisms. In some cases, however, folded proteins can aggregate without crossing the major energy barrier for unfolding, by populating native-like conformations as a consequence of thermal fluctuations, ligand release or local unfolding occurring in particular circumstances. In these native-like conformations, segments that are normally buried or structured in the fully folded and possessing a high propensity to aggregate become exposed to the solvent or flexible, allowing the formation of native-like aggregates, which convert subsequently into nuclei and fibrils. This process is called &#x27;native-like aggregation&#x27; (green arrows in the figure) and is similar to the &#x27;nucleated conformational conversion&#x27; model.

A more recent, modern and thorough model of amyloid fibril formation involves the intervention of secondary events, such as &#x27;fragmentation&#x27;, in which a fibril breaks into two or more shorter fibrils, and &#x27;secondary nucleation&#x27;, in which fibril surfaces (not fibril ends) catalyze the formation of new nuclei. Both secondary events increase the number of fibril ends able to recruit new monomers or oligomers, therefore accelerating fibril formation through a positive feedback mechanism. These events add to the well recognised steps of primary nucleation (formation of the nucleus from the monomers through one of models described above), fibril elongation (addition of monomers or oligomers to growing fibril ends) and dissociation (opposite process).

Such a new model is described in the figure on the right and involves the utilization of a master equation that includes all steps of amyloid fibril formation, i.e. primary nucleation, fibril elongation, secondary nucleation and fibril fragmentation. The rate constants of the various steps can be determined from a global fit of a number of time courses of aggregation (for example ThT fluorescence emission versus time) recorded at different protein concentrations. The general master equation approach to amyloid fibril formation with secondary pathways has been developed by Knowles, Vendruscolo, Cohen, Michaels and coworkers and considers the time evolution of the concentration formula_1 of fibrils of length formula_2 (here formula_2 represents the number of monomers in an aggregate). formula_4where formula_5 denotes the Kronecker delta. The physical interpretation of the various terms in the above master equation is straight forward: the terms on the first line describe the growth of fibrils via monomer addition with rate constant formula_6 (elongation). The terms on the second line describe monomer dissociation, i.e. the inverse process of elongation. formula_7 is the rate constant of monomer dissociation. The terms on the third line describe the effect of fragmentation, which is assumed to occur homogeneously along fibrils with rate constant formula_8. Finally, the terms on the last line describe primary and secondary nucleation respectively. Note that the rate of secondary nucleation is proportional to the mass of aggregates, defined as formula_9.

Following this analytical approach, it has become apparent that the lag phase does not correspond necessarily to only nucleus formation, but rather results from a combination of various steps. Similarly, the exponential phase is not only fibril elongation, but results from a combination of various steps, involving primary nucleation, fibril elongation, but also secondary events. A significant quantity of fibrils resulting from primary nucleation and fibril elongation may be formed during the lag phase and secondary steps, rather than only fibril elongation, can be the dominant processes contributing to fibril growth during the exponential phase. With this new model, any perturbing agents of amyloid fibril formation, such as putative drugs, metabolites, mutations, chaperones, etc., can be assigned to a specific step of fibril formation.

== Amino acid sequence and amyloid formation ==
In general, amyloid polymerization (aggregation or non-covalent polymerization) is sequence-sensitive, that is mutations in the sequence can induce or prevent self-assembly. For example, humans produce amylin, an amyloidogenic peptide associated with type II diabetes, but in rats and mice prolines are substituted in critical locations and amyloidogenesis does not occur. Studies comparing synthetic to recombinant β amyloid peptide in assays measuring rate of fibrillation, fibril homogeneity, and cellular toxicity showed that recombinant β amyloid peptide has a faster fibrillation rate and greater toxicity than synthetic β amyloid peptide.

There are multiple classes of amyloid-forming polypeptide sequences. Glutamine-rich polypeptides are important in the amyloidogenesis of Yeast and mammalian prions, as well as trinucleotide repeat disorders including Huntington&#x27;s disease. When glutamine-rich polypeptides are in a β-sheet conformation, glutamines can brace the structure by forming inter-strand hydrogen bonding between its amide carbonyls and nitrogens of both the backbone and side chains. The onset age for Huntington&#x27;s disease shows an inverse correlation with the length of the polyglutamine sequence, with analogous findings in a &quot;C. elegans&quot; model system with engineered polyglutamine peptides.

Other polypeptides and proteins such as amylin and the β amyloid peptide do not have a simple consensus sequence and are thought to aggregate through the sequence segments enriched with hydrophobic residues, or residues with high propensity to form β-sheet structure. Among the hydrophobic residues, aromatic amino-acids are found to have the highest amyloidogenic propensity.

Cross-polymerization (fibrils of one polypeptide sequence causing other fibrils of another sequence to form) is observed in vitro and possibly in vivo. This phenomenon is important, since it would explain interspecies prion propagation and differential rates of prion propagation, as well as a statistical link between Alzheimer&#x27;s and type 2 diabetes. In general, the more similar the peptide sequence the more efficient cross-polymerization is, though entirely dissimilar sequences can cross-polymerize and highly similar sequences can even be &quot;blockers&quot; that prevent polymerization.

==Amyloid toxicity==

The reasons why amyloid cause diseases are unclear. In some cases, the deposits physically disrupt tissue architecture, suggesting disruption of function by some bulk process. An emerging consensus implicates prefibrillar intermediates, rather than mature amyloid fibers, in causing cell death, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. The fibrils are, however, far from innocuous, as they keep the protein homeostasis network engaged, release oligomers, cause the formation of toxic oligomers via secondary nucleation, grow indefinitely spreading from district to district and, in some cases, may be toxic themselves.

Calcium dysregulation has been observed to occur early in cells exposed to protein oligomers. These small aggregates can form ion channels through lipid bilayer membranes and activate NMDA and AMPA receptors. Channel formation has been hypothesized to account for calcium dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction by allowing indiscriminate leakage of ions across cell membranes. Studies have shown that amyloid deposition is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and a resulting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can initiate a signalling pathway leading to apoptosis. There are reports that indicate amyloid polymers (such as those of huntingtin, associated with Huntington&#x27;s disease) can induce the polymerization of essential amyloidogenic proteins, which should be deleterious to cells. Also, interaction partners of these essential proteins can also be sequestered.

All these mechanisms of toxicity are likely to play a role. In fact, the aggregation of a protein generates a variety of aggregates, all of which are likely to be toxic to some degree. A wide variety of biochemical, physiological and cytological perturbations has been identified following the exposure of cells and animals to such species, independently of their identity. The oligomers have also been reported to interact with a variety of molecular targets. Hence, it is unlikely that there is a unique mechanism of toxicity or a unique cascade of cellular events. The misfolded nature of protein aggregates causes a multitude of aberrant interactions with a multitude of cellular components, including membranes, protein receptors, soluble proteins, RNAs, small metabolites, etc.

== Histological staining ==
In the clinical setting, amyloid diseases are typically identified by a change in the spectroscopic properties of planar aromatic dyes such as thioflavin T, congo red or NIAD-4. In general, this is attributed to the environmental change, as these dyes intercalate between β-strands to confine their structure.

Congo Red positivity remains the gold standard for diagnosis of amyloidosis. In general, binding of Congo Red to amyloid plaques produces a typical apple-green birefringence when viewed under cross-polarized light. Recently, significant enhancement of fluorescence quantum yield of NIAD-4 was exploited to super-resolution fluorescence imaging of amyloid fibrils and oligomers. To avoid nonspecific staining, other histology stains, such as the hematoxylin and eosin stain, are used to quench the dyes&#x27; activity in other places such as the nucleus, where the dye might bind. Modern antibody technology and immunohistochemistry has made specific staining easier, but often this can cause trouble because epitopes can be concealed in the amyloid fold; in general, an amyloid protein structure is a different conformation from the one that the antibody recognizes.

<doc id="396727" wikidata="Q375513" url="?curid=396727" title="History of Quebec">
<text>Quebec was first called &quot;Canada&quot; between 1534 and 1763. It was the most developed colony of New France as well as New France&#x27;s centre, responsible for a variety of dependencies (ex. Acadia, Plaisance, Louisiana, and the Pays d&#x27;en Haut). Common themes in Quebec&#x27;s early history as &quot;Canada&quot; include the fur trade — because it was the main industry — as well as the exploration of North America, war against the English, and alliances or war with Native American groups.

Following the Seven Years&#x27; War, Quebec became a British colony in the British Empire. It was first known as the Province of Quebec (1763–1791), then as Lower Canada (1791–1841), and then as Canada East (1841–1867) as a result of the Lower Canada Rebellion. During this period, the inferior socio-economic status of francophones (because anglophones dominated the natural resources and industries of Quebec), the Catholic church, resistance against cultural assimilation, and isolation from non English-speaking populations were important themes.

Quebec was confederated with Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in 1867, beginning the Confederation of Canada. Important events that mark this period are the World Wars, the Grande Noirceur, the Quiet Revolution (which improved the socio-economic standing of French Canadians and secularized Quebec), and the emergence of the contemporary Quebec sovereignty movement.

These three large periods of Quebec&#x27;s history are represented on its coat of arms with three fleur-de-lis, followed by a lion, and then three maple leaves.

== Summary of Quebec&#x27;s political transformations ==
Names in bold refer to provinces, others to sub-provincial levels of government; the first names listed are those areas mostly nearly corresponding to contemporary Quebec.
* Canada, the core of New France (1608–1761): a French colony
* Province of Quebec (1763–1791): a British colony
* Lower Canada, one of the Canadas (1791–1841): a British colony
* the Canada East portion of the Province of Canada (1841–1867): a British colony
* Quebec (1867–present): a province of Canada

== Precolonial era ==
The Paleo-Indians, theorized to have migrated from Asia to America between 20,000 and 14,000 years ago, were the first people to establish themselves on the lands of Quebec, arriving there after the Laurentide Ice Sheet melted 11,000-10,000 years ago. From them, many ethnocultural groups emerged over time. The vast majority are forgotten today because none of them developed writing. Before contact with Europeans, aboriginals passed down their history and other cultural knowledge through oral tradition.

=== Paleo-Indian Era (11,000–8000 BC) ===
Existing archaeological evidence attests to a human presence on the current territory of Quebec sometime around 10,000 BC.

=== Archaic era (8000–1500 BC) ===
The Paleoindian period was followed by the Archaic, a time when major changes occurred in the landscape and the settlement of the territory of Quebec. With the end of glaciation, the inhabitable territory increased in size and the environment (such as climate, vegetation, lakes and rivers) became increasingly stable. Migrations became rarer and moving around became a seasonal activity necessary for hunting, fishing or gathering.

The nomadic populations of the Archaic period were better established and were very familiar with the resources of their territories. They adapted to their surroundings and experienced a degree of population growth. Their diet and tools diversified. Aboriginal peoples used a greater variety of local material, developed new techniques, such as polishing stone, and devised increasingly specialized tools, such as knives, awls, fish hooks, and nets.

=== Woodland era (3000 BC–1500 AD) ===
Agriculture appeared experimentally toward the 8th century. It was only in the 14th century that it was fully mastered in the Saint Lawrence River valley by the Iroquoians, who cultivated corn, marrow, sunflowers, and beans.

In the 1500s, Inuit communities could be found in Nunavik, as well as 11 First Nations:

*Abenakis
*Algonquins
*Atikamekw
*Crees
*Innu
*Malecite
*Mi&#x27;kmaq
*Mohawks
*Naskapi
*Wendats

Each group had their own languages, way of life, economies, and religious beliefs.

Some linguists and archaeologists also consider the St. Lawrence Iroquoians to be distinct enough from the other Iroquoians to be considered their own group.

== European explorations ==
In the 15th century, the Byzantine Empire fell. For the Christian West, this made trade with the Far East, usually for things like spices and gold, more difficult because sea routes were now under the control of less cooperative Arab and Italian merchants. As such, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the Spanish and Portuguese, and then the English and French, began to search for a new sea route.

In 1508, only 16 years after the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, Thomas Auber, who was likely part of a fishing trip near Newfoundland, brought back a few Amerindians to France. This indicates that in the early 16th century, French navigators ventured in the gulf of the St. Lawrence, along with the Basques and the Spaniards who did the same.

Around 1522–1523, the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano persuaded King Francis I of France to commission an expedition to find a western route to Cathay (China). Therefore, King Francis I launched a maritime expedition in 1524, led by Giovanni da Verrazzano, to search for the Northwest Passage. Though this expedition was unsuccessful, it established the name &quot;New France&quot; for Northeastern North America.

On June 24, 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier planted a cross on the Gaspé Peninsula and took possession of the territory in the name of King François I of France.

On his second voyage on May 26, 1535, Cartier sailed upriver to the St. Lawrence Iroquoian villages of Stadacona, near present-day Quebec City, and Hochelaga, near present-day Montreal. That year, Cartier decided to name the village and its surrounding territories &quot;Canada&quot;, because he had heard two young natives use the word &quot;kanata&quot; (&quot;village&quot; in Iroquois) to describe the location. 16th-century European cartographers would quickly adopt this name. Cartier also wrote that he thought he had discovered large amounts of diamonds and gold, but this ended up only being quartz and pyrite. Then, by following what he called the Great River, he traveled West to the Lachine Rapids. There, navigation proved too dangerous for Cartier to continue his journey towards the goal: China. Cartier and his sailors had no choice but to return to Stadaconé and winter there. In the end, Cartier returned to France and took about 10 Native Americans, including the St. Lawrence Iroquoians chief Donnacona, with him. In 1540, Donnacona told the legend of the Kingdom of Saguenay to the King of France. This inspired the king to order a third expedition, this time led by Jean-François de La Rocque de Roberval and with the goal of finding the Kingdom of Saguenay. But, it was unsuccessful.

In 1541, Jean-François Roberval became lieutenant of New France and had the responsibility to build a new colony in America. It was Cartier who established the first French settlement on American soil, Charlesbourg Royal.

France was disappointed after the three voyages of Cartier and did not want to invest further large sums in an adventure with such uncertain outcome. A period of disinterest in the new world on behalf of the French authorities followed. Only at the very end of the 16th century interest in these northern territories was renewed.

Still, even during the time when France did not send official explorers, Breton and Basque fishermen came to the new territories to stock up on codfish and whale oil. Since they were forced to stay for a longer period of time, they started to trade their metal objects for fur provided by the indigenous people. This commerce became profitable and thus the interest in the territory was revived.

Fur commerce made a permanent residence in the country worthwhile. Good relations with the aboriginal providers were necessary. For some fishermen however, a seasonal presence was sufficient. Commercial companies were founded that tried to further the interest of the Crown in colonizing the territory. They demanded that France grant a monopoly to one single company. In return, this company would also take over the colonization of the French American territory. Thus, it would not cost the king much money to build the colony. On the other hand, other merchants wanted commerce to stay unregulated. This controversy was a big issue at the turn of the 17th century.

By the end of the 17th century, a census showed that around 10,000 French settlers were farming along the lower St. Lawrence Valley. By 1700, fewer than 20,000 people of French origin were settled in New France, extending from Newfoundland to the Mississippi, with the pattern of settlement following the networks of the cod fishery and fur trade, although most Quebec settlers were farmers.

Around 1580, France became interested in America again, because the fur trade had become important in Europe. France returned to America looking for a specific animal: the beaver. As New France was full of beavers, it became a colonial-trading post where the main activity was the fur trade in the Pays-d&#x27;en-Haut. In 1600, Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit founded the first permanent trading post in Tadoussac for expeditions carried out in the Domaine du Roy.

In 1603, Samuel de Champlain travelled to the Saint Lawrence River and, on Pointe Saint-Mathieu, established a defence pact with the Innu, Wolastoqiyik and Micmacs, that would be &quot;a decisive factor in the maintenance of a French colonial enterprise in America despite an enormous numerical disadvantage vis-à-vis the British colonization in the South&quot;. Thus also began French military support to the Algonquian and Huron peoples in defence against Iroquois attacks and invasions. These Iroquois attacks would become known as the Beaver Wars and would last from the early 1600s to the early 1700s.

==Canada of New France (1608–1763)==
Modern Quebec was part of the territory of New France, the general name for the North American possessions of France until 1763. At its largest extent, before the Treaty of Utrecht, this territory included several colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, and Louisiana.

The borders of these colonies were not precisely defined, and were open on the western side, as the maps below show:

=== Early years (1608–1663) ===

Quebec City was founded in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. Some other towns were founded before, like Tadoussac in 1604 which still exists today, but Quebec was the first to be meant as a permanent settlement and not a simple trading post. Over time, it became a province of Canada and all of New France.

The first version of the town was a single large walled building, called the Habitation. A similar Habitation was established in Port Royal in 1605, in Acadia. This arrangement was made for protection against perceived threats from the indigenous people. The difficulty of supplying the city of Quebec from France and the lack of knowledge of the area meant that life was hard. A significant fraction of the population died of hunger and diseases during the first winter. However, agriculture soon expanded and a continuous flow of immigrants, mostly men in search of adventure, increased the population.

The settlement was built as a permanent fur trading outpost. First Nations traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing. In 1616, the Habitation du Québec became the first permanent establishment of the with the arrival of its two very first settlers: Louis Hébert and Marie Rollet.

The French quickly established trading posts throughout their territory, trading for fur with aboriginal hunters. The &quot;coureur des bois&quot;, who were freelance traders, explored much of the area themselves. They kept trade and communications flowing through a vast network along the rivers of the hinterland. They established fur trading forts on the Great Lakes (Étienne Brûlé 1615), Hudson Bay (Radisson and Groseilliers 1659–60), Ohio River and Mississippi River (La Salle 1682), as well as the Saskatchewan River and Missouri River (de la Verendrye 1734–1738). This network was inherited by the English and Scottish traders after the fall of the French Empire in Quebec, and many of the coureur des bois became &quot;voyageurs&quot; for the British.

In 1612, the &quot;Compagnie de Rouen&quot; received the royal mandate to manage the operations of New France and the fur trade. In 1621, they were replaced by the &quot;Compagnie de Montmorency.&quot; Then, in 1627, they were substituted by the &quot;Compagnie des Cent-Associés&quot;. Shortly after being appointed, the Compagnie des Cent-Associés introduced the Custom of Paris and the seigneurial system to New France. They also forbade settlement in New France by anyone other than Roman Catholics. The Catholic Church was given &quot;en seigneurie&quot; large and valuable tracts of land estimated at nearly 30% of all the lands granted by the French Crown in New France.

Because of war with England, the first two convoys of ships and settlers bound for the colony were waylaid near Gaspé by British privateers under the command of three French-Scottish Huguenot brothers, David, Louis and Thomas Kirke. Quebec was effectively cut off. In 1629, there was the surrender of Quebec, without battle, to English privateers led by David Kirke during the Anglo-French War. On 19 July 1629, with Quebec completely out of supplies and no hope of relief, Champlain surrendered Quebec to the Kirkes without a fight. Champlain and other colonists were taken to England, where they learned that peace had been agreed (in the 1629 Treaty of Suza) before Quebec&#x27;s surrender, and the Kirkes were obliged to return their takings. However, they refused, and it was not until the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye that Quebec and all other captured French possessions in North America were returned to New France. Champlain was restored as de facto governor but died three years later.

In 1633, Cardinal Richelieu granted a charter to the Company of One Hundred Associates, which had been created by the Cardinal himself in 1627. This gave the company control over the booming fur trade and land rights across the territory in exchange for the company supporting and expanding settlement in New France (at the time encompassing Acadia, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Louisiana). Specific clauses in the charter included a requirement to bring 4000 settlers into New France over the next 15 years. The company largely ignored the settlement requirements of their charter and focused on the lucrative fur trade, only 300 settlers arriving before 1640. On the verge of bankruptcy, the company lost its fur trade monopoly in 1641 and was finally dissolved in 1662.

In 1634, Sieur de Laviolette founded Trois-Rivières at the mouth of the Saint-Maurice River. In 1642, Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve founded Ville-Marie (now Montreal) on Pointe-à-Callière. He chose to found Montreal on an island so that the settlement could be naturally protected against Iroquois invasions. Many heroes of New France come from this period, such as Dollard des Ormeaux, Guillaume Couture, Madeleine de Verchères and the Canadian Martyrs.

=== Royal Province (1663–1760) ===

The establishment of the &quot;Conseil souverain&quot;, political restructuring which turned New France into a province of France, ended the period of company rule and marked a new beginning in the colonization effort.

In 1663, the Company of New France ceded Canada to the King, King Louis XIV, who officially made New France into a royal province of France. New France would now be a true colony administered by the Sovereign Council of New France from Québec, and which functioned off . A governor-general, assisted by the intendant of New France and the bishop of Québec, would go on to govern the colony of Canada (Montreal, Québec, Trois-Rivières and the Pays-d&#x27;en-Haut) and its administrative dependencies: Acadia, Louisiana and Plaisance.The French settlers were mostly farmers and they were known as &quot;Canadiens&quot; or &quot;Habitants&quot;. Though there was little immigration, the colony still grew because of the Habitants&#x27; high birth rates. In 1665, the Carignan-Salières regiment developed the string of fortifications known as the &quot;Valley of Forts&quot; to protect against Iroquois invasions. The Regiment brought along with them 1,200 new men from Dauphiné, Liguria, Piedmont and Savoy. To redress the severe imbalance between single men and women, and boost population growth, King Louis XIV sponsored the passage of approximately 800 young French women (known as &quot;les filles du roi&quot;) to the colony. In 1666, intendant Jean Talon organized the first census of the colony and counted 3,215 Habitants. Talon also enacted policies to diversify agriculture and encourage births, which, in 1672, had increased the population to 6,700 Canadiens.

In 1686, the Chevalier de Troyes and the Troupes de la Marine seized three northern forts the English had erected on the lands explored by Charles Albanel in 1671 near Hudson Bay. Similarly, in the south, Cavelier de La Salle took for France lands discovered by Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet in 1673 along the Mississippi River. As a result, the colony of New France&#x27;s territory grew to extend from Hudson Bay all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, and would also encompass the Great Lakes.

In the early 1700s, Governor Callières concluded the Great Peace of Montreal, which not only confirmed the alliance between the Algonquian peoples and New France, but also definitively ended the Beaver Wars. In 1701, Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville founded the district of Louisiana and made its administrative headquarter Biloxi. Its headquarters was later moved to Mobile, and then to New Orleans. During this time, the town had a population of 2,000 settlers. In 1738, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, extended New France to Lake Winnipeg. In 1742, his voyageur sons, François and Louis-Joseph, crossed the Great Plains and discovered the Rocky Mountains.

From 1688 onwards, the fierce competition between the French Empire and British Empire to control North America&#x27;s interior and monopolize the fur trade pitted New France and its Indigenous allies against the Iroquois and English -primarily in the Province of New York- in a series of four successive wars called the French and Indian Wars by Americans, and the Intercolonial wars in Quebec. The first three of these wars were King William&#x27;s War (1688–1697), Queen Anne&#x27;s War (1702–1713), and King George&#x27;s War (1744–1748). Many notable battles and exchanges of land took place. In 1690, the Battle of Quebec became the first time Québec&#x27;s defences were tested. In 1713, following the Peace of Utrecht, the Duke of Orléans ceded Acadia and Plaisance Bay to the Kingdom of Great Britain, but retained Île Saint-Jean, and Île-Royale (Cape Breton Island) where the Fortress of Louisbourg was subsequently erected. These losses were significant since Plaisance Bay was the primary communication route between New France and France, and Acadia contained 5,000 Acadians. In the siege of Louisbourg in 1745, the British were victorious, but returned the city to France after war concessions.

====Catholic nuns====

Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns. Stimulated by the influence in France of the popular religiosity of the Counter-Reformation, new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century and became a permanent feature of Quebec society.

The Ursuline Sisters arrived in Quebec City in 1639, and in Montreal in 1641. They spread as well to small towns. They had to overcome harsh conditions, uncertain funding, and unsympathetic authorities as they engaged in educational and nursing functions. They attracted endowments and became important landowners in Quebec. Marie de l&#x27;Incarnation (1599–1672) was the mother superior at Quebec, 1639–72.

During the 1759 Quebec Campaign of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Augustinian nun Marie-Joseph Legardeur de Repentigny, Sœur de la Visitation, managed the Hôpital Général in Quebec City and oversaw the care of hundreds of wounded soldiers from both the French and British forces. She wrote in after-action report on her work, noting, &quot;The surrender of Quebec only increased our work. The British generals came to our hospital to assure us of their protection and at the same time made us responsible for their sick and wounded.&quot; The British officers stationed at the hospital reported on the cleanliness and high quality of the care provided. Most civilians deserted the city, leaving the Hôpital Général as a refugee centre for the poor who had nowhere to go. The nuns set up a mobile aid station that reached out to the cities refugees, distributing food and treating the sick and injured.

===British conquest of New France (1754–1763)===
In the middle of the 18th century, British North America had grown to be close to a full-fledged independent country, something they would actually become a few decades later, with more than 1 million inhabitants. Meanwhile, New France was still seen mostly as a cheap source of natural resources for the metropolis, and had only 60,000 inhabitants. Nevertheless, New France was territorially larger than the Thirteen Colonies, but had a population less than the size. There was warfare along the borders, with the French supporting Indian raids into the American colonies.

The earliest battles of the French and Indian War occurred in 1754 and soon widened into the worldwide Seven Years&#x27; War. The territory of New France at that time included parts of present-day Upstate New York, and a series of battles were fought there. The French military enjoyed early successes in these frontier battles, gaining control over several strategic points in 1756 and 1757.

The British sent substantial military forces, while the Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic, preventing France from sending much help. In 1758 the British captured Louisbourg, gaining control over the mouth of the St. Lawrence, and also took control of key forts on the frontier in battles at Frontenac and Duquesne. In spite of the spectacular defeat of the supposed main British thrust in the Battle of Carillon (in which a banner was supposedly carried that inspired the modern flag of Quebec), the French military position was poor.
In the next phase of the war, begun in 1759, the British aimed directly at the heart of New France. General James Wolfe led a fleet of 49 ships holding 8,640 British troops to the fortress of Quebec. They disembarked on Île d&#x27;Orléans and on the south shore of the river; the French forces under Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, Marquis de Saint-Veran, held the walled city and the north shore. Wolfe laid siege to the city for more than two months, exchanging cannon fire over the river, but neither side could break the siege. As neither side could expect resupply during the winter, Wolfe moved to force a battle. On 5 September 1759, after successfully convincing Montcalm he would attack by the Bay of Beauport east of the city, the British troops crossed close to Cap-Rouge, west of the city, and successfully climbed the steep Cape Diamond undetected. Montcalm, for disputed reasons, did not use the protection of the city walls and fought on open terrain, in what would be known as the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The battle was short and bloody; both leaders died in battle, but the British easily won. (&quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; is a well-known 1770 painting by artist Benjamin West depicting the final moments of Wolfe.)

Now in possession of the main city and capital, and further isolating the inner cities of Trois-Rivières and Montreal from France, the rest of the campaign was only a matter of slowly taking control of the land. While the French had a tactical victory in the Battle of Sainte-Foy outside Quebec in 1760, an attempt to lay siege to the city ended in defeat the following month when British ships arrived and forced the French besiegers to retreat. An attempt to resupply the French military was further dashed in the naval Battle of Restigouche, and Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, New France&#x27;s last Royal governor, surrendered Montreal on 8 September 1760. Because the Seven Years&#x27; War was still ongoing in Europe, the British put the region under a British military regime between 1760 and 1763.

Britain&#x27;s success in the war forced France to cede all of Canada to the British at the Treaty of Paris. The Royal Proclamation of 7 October 1763 by King George III of Great Britain set out the terms of government for the newly captured territory, as well as defining the geographic boundaries of the territory.

The rupture from France would provoke a transformation within the descendants of the Canadiens that would eventually result in the birth of a new nation whose development and culture would be founded upon, among other things, ancestral foundations anchored in Northeastern America. What British Commissioner John George Lambton (Lord Durham) would describe in his 1839 report would be the kind of relationship that would reign between the &quot;Two Solitudes&quot; of Canada for a long time: &quot;I found two nations at war within one state; I found a struggle, not of principles, but of races&quot;. Incoming British immigrants would find that Canadiens were as full of national pride as they were, and while these newcomers would see the American territories as a vast ground for colonization and speculation, the Canadiens would regard Quebec as the heritage of their own race - not as a country to colonize, but as a country already colonized.

== Province of Quebec (1763–1791) ==
British rule under Royal Governor James Murray was benign, with the French Canadians guaranteed their traditional rights and customs. The British Royal Proclamation of 1763 united three Quebec districts into the Province of Quebec. It was the British who were the first to use the name &quot;Quebec&quot; to refer to a territory beyond Quebec City. The British tolerated the Catholic Church, and protected the traditional social and economic structure of Quebec. Much French law was retained inside a system of British courts, all under the command of the British governor. The goal was to satisfy the Francophile settlers, albeit to the annoyance of British merchants.

=== Quebec Act (1774) ===
With unrest growing in the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the American Revolution, the British were worried that the Canadiens might also support the growing rebellion. At the time, Canadiens formed the vast majority of the population of the Province of Quebec. To secure the allegiance of Canadiens to the British crown, Governor James Murray and later Governor Guy Carleton promoted the need for accommodations. This eventually resulted in enactment of the Quebec Act of 1774. The &quot;Quebec Act&quot; was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain setting procedures of governance in the Province of Quebec. Among other components, this act restored the use of the French civil law for private matters while maintaining the use of the English common law for public administration (including criminal prosecution), replaced the oath of allegiance so that it no longer made reference to the Protestant faith, and guaranteed free practice of the Catholic faith. The purpose of this Act was to secure the allegiance of the French Canadians with unrest growing in the American colonies to the south.

=== American Revolutionary War ===

When the American Revolutionary War broke out in early 1775, Quebec became a target for American forces, that sought to liberate the French population there from British rule. In September 1775 the Continental Army began a two-pronged invasion, with one army capturing Montreal while another traveled through the wilderness of what is now Maine toward Quebec City. The two armies joined forces, but were defeated in the Battle of Quebec, in which the American General Richard Montgomery was slain. The Americans were driven back into New York by the arrival of a large army of British troops and German auxiliaries (&quot;Hessians&quot;) in June 1776.

Before and during the American occupation of the province, there was a significant propaganda war in which both the Americans and the British sought to gain the population&#x27;s support. The Americans succeeded in raising two regiments in Quebec, led by James Livingston and Moses Hazen, one of which served throughout the war. Hazen&#x27;s 2nd Canadian Regiment served in the Philadelphia campaign and also at the Siege of Yorktown, and included Edward Antill, a New Yorker living in Quebec City (who actually led the regiment at Yorktown as Hazen had been promoted to brigadier general), Clément Gosselin, Germain Dionne, and many others. Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil, a Quebecker, was with the French Navy in the Battle of the Chesapeake that prevented the British Navy from reaching Yorktown, Virginia.
After General John Burgoyne&#x27;s failed 1777 campaign for control of the Hudson River, Quebec was used as a base for raiding operations into the northern parts of the United States until the end of the war. In the Western theater of the war, U.S. forces had much better success in areas north of the Ohio River, which were annexed to Quebec in 1774. During the Illinois campaign, Virginia militia leader George Rogers Clark captured Kaskaskia without any loss of life. From there, his men marched into and captured Vincennes, but was soon lost to British Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hamilton, the commander at Fort Detroit. It was later retaken by Clark in the Siege of Fort Vincennes in February 1779. Roughly half of Clark&#x27;s militia in the theater were French Canadian volunteers sympathetic to the American cause.

When the war ended in 1783, Quebec shrunk as a result, with portions of its southwest being ceded to the new United States in accordance with the Treaty of Paris. Around 75,000 or 15% of the Loyalists fled the new United States, with 85% of the rest choosing to stay. These refugees were resettled into parts of the province that bordered on Lake Ontario. These settlers eventually sought to separate themselves administratively from the French-speaking Quebec population, which occurred in 1791.

== Lower Canada (1791–1840) ==
The Constitutional Act of 1791 divided Quebec into Upper Canada (the part of present-day Ontario south of Lake Nipissing plus the current Ontario shoreline of Georgian Bay and Lake Superior) and Lower Canada (the southern part of present-day Quebec). Newly arrived English-speaking Loyalist refugees had refused to adopt the Quebec seigneurial system of land tenure, or the French civil law system, giving the British reason to separate the English-speaking settlements from the French-speaking territory as administrative jurisdictions. Upper Canada&#x27;s first capital was Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the-Lake); in 1796, it was moved to York (now Toronto).

The new constitution, primarily passed to answer the demands of the Loyalists, created a unique situation in Lower Canada. The Legislative Assembly, the only elected body in the colonial government, was continually at odds with the Legislative and Executive branches appointed by the governor. When, in the early 19th century, the Parti canadien rose as a nationalist, liberal and reformist party, a long political struggle started between the majority of the elected representatives of Lower Canada and the colonial government. The majority of the elected representatives in the assembly were members of the francophone professional class: &quot;lawyers, notaries, doctors, innkeepers or small merchants&quot;, who comprised 77.4% of the assembly from 1792 to 1836.

By 1809, the government of Newfoundland was no longer willing to supervise the coasts of Labrador. To solve this issue, and as a result of lobbying in London, the British government assigned the coasts of Labrador to the colony of Newfoundland. The inland border between the jurisdiction of Lower Canada and Newfoundland was not well-defined.

In 1813, Beauport-native Charles-Michel de Salaberry became a hero by leading the Canadian troops to victory at the Battle of Chateauguay, during the War of 1812. In this battle, 300 Voltigeurs and 22 Amerindians successfully pushed back a force of 7,000 Americans. This loss caused the Americans to abandon the Saint Lawrence Campaign, their major strategic effort to conquer Canada. 

The Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, who represented the people, came more and more into conflict with the superior authority of the Crown and its appointed representatives. In 1834, things hit a breaking point and the Parti canadien presented its 92 resolutions, a series of political demands which expressed a genuine loss of confidence in the British monarchy. London refused to consider these and, in response, submitted . Discontentment intensified throughout the public meetings of 1837, sometimes being led by tribunes like Louis-Joseph Papineau. Despite opposition from ecclesiastics, for example Jean-Jacques Lartigue, the Rebellion of the Patriotes began in 1837. Key goals for the rebels were to have responsible government and, for many, to terminate prejudicial dominance of the English minority over the French majority. Louis-Joseph Papineau was instrumental in acting as a leadership figure for the rebels, yet his ideological views were ambiguous concerning the relative importance of seigneurial landowners, the Roman Catholic Church, and the francophone bourgeoisie. Under his influence, the first rebellion of 1837 was directed at the seigneurs and the clergy as much as the anglophone governor. The 1837 rebellion resulted in a declaration of martial law, and suspension of Canada&#x27;s Constitution. To centralize authority under the Crown, John Lambton, Lord Durham was named governor of all of British North America.

In 1837, Louis-Joseph Papineau and Robert Nelson led residents of Lower Canada to form an armed resistance group called the Patriotes in order to seek an end to the unilateral control of the British governors. They made a Declaration of Independence in 1838, guaranteeing human rights and equality for all citizens without discrimination. Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and Upper Canada. The Patriotes forces were victorious in their first battle, the Battle of Saint-Denis, due to government forces being unprepared. However, the Patriotes were unorganized and badly equipped, leading to them suffering a defeat in their second battle, the Battle of Saint-Charles, and another defeat in their final battle, the Battle of Saint-Eustache. Following the government defeat of the Patriotes, the Catholic clergy recovered their moral authority among the people and preached for the cohesion and development of the nation in the fields of education, health and civil society.

=== Martial law and Special Council (1838–1840) ===
The second rebellion in 1838 was to have more far-reaching consequences. In 1838, Lord Durham arrived in Canada as High Commissioner. Although skirmishes with government troops were relatively bloodless during the second rebellion of 1838, the Crown dealt forcefully in punishing the rebels. 850 of them were arrested; 12 were eventually hanged, and 58 were transported to Australian penal colonies.

In 1839, Lord Durham was called upon by the Crown to deliver a &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot; as a result of the rebellions. The Special Council that governed the colony from 1838 to 1841 enacted many reforms with the aim of improving economic and bureaucratic affairs, such as land ownership and the establishment of new schools. These institutional reforms ultimately became the foundation of &quot;responsible government&quot; in the colony.

Many American colonists who remained loyal to England left the 13 Atlantic colonies before American independence for Canada, with many settling in communities in southern Quebec. In the 19th century, Quebec experienced several waves of immigration, principally from England, Scotland and Ireland. At the turn of the 20th century, immigrants to Quebec came mainly from Ireland, but large numbers of immigrants arrived from Germany and other areas of western Europe.

== Province of Canada (1840–1867) ==
Lord Durham recommended that Upper Canada and Lower Canada be united, in order to make the francophone population of Lower Canada a minority within the united territory and weaken its influence. Durham expressed his objectives in plain terms. His recommendation was followed; the new seat of government was located in Montreal, with the former Upper Canada being referred to as &quot;Canada West&quot; and the former Lower Canada being referred to as &quot;Canada East&quot;. The Act of Union 1840 formed the Province of Canada. Rebellion continued sporadically, and in 1849, the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal led to the relocation of the seat of government to Toronto. Historian François-Xavier Garneau, like other Canada East francophones during the 1840s, had deep concerns about the united entity and the place of the francophones within it.

This union, unsurprisingly, was the main source of political instability until 1867. The differences between the two cultural groups of the Province of Canada made it impossible to govern without forming coalition governments. Furthermore, despite their population gap, both Canada East and Canada West obtained an identical number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, which created representation problems. In the beginning, Canada East was under-represented because of its superior population size. Over time, however, massive immigration from the British Isles to Canada West occurred, which increased its population. Since the two regions continued to have equal representation in the Parliament, this meant that it was now Canada West that was under-represented. The representation issues were frequently called into question by debates on &quot;Representation by Population&quot;, or &quot;Rep by Pop&quot;. When Canada West was under-represented, the issue became a rallying cry for the Canada West Reformers and Clear Grits, led by George Brown.

In 1844, the capital of the Province of Canada was moved from Kingston to Montreal. 

In this period, the Loyalists and immigrants from the British Isles decided to no longer refer to themselves as English or British, and instead appropriated the term &quot;Canadian&quot;, referring to Canada, their place of residence. The &quot;Old Canadians&quot; responded to this appropriation of identity by henceforth identifying with their ethnic community, under the name &quot;French Canadian&quot;. As such, the terms &quot;French Canadian&quot; and &quot;English Canadian&quot; were born. French Canadian writers began to reflect on the survival of their own. François-Xavier Garneau wrote an influential national epic, and wrote to Lord Elgin: &quot;I have undertaken this work with the aim of re-establishing the truth so often disfigured, and of repelling the attacks and insults which my compatriots have been and still are the daily target of, from men who would like to oppress and exploit them all at every opportunity. I thought the best way to achieve this was to simply expose their story&quot;. His and other written works allowed French Canadians to preserve their collective consciousness and to protect themselves from assimilation, much like works like &quot;Evangeline&quot; had done for Acadians.

Political unrest came to a head in 1849, when English Canadian rioters set fire to the Parliament Building in Montreal following the enactment of the &quot;Rebellion Losses Bill,&quot; a law that compensated French Canadians whose properties were destroyed during the rebellions of 1837–1838. This bill, resulting from the Baldwin-La Fontaine coalition and Lord Elgin&#x27;s advice, was a very important one as it established the notion of responsible government. In 1854, the seigneurial system was abolished, the Grand Trunk Railway was built and the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty was implemented. In 1866, the Civil Code of Lower Canada was adopted. Then, the long period of political impasse that was the Province of Canada came to a close as the Macdonald-Cartier coalition began to reform the political system.

== Confederation and Early Quebec (1867–1914) ==
In the decades immediately before Canadian Confederation in 1867, French-speaking Quebeckers, known at that time as Canadiens, remained a majority within Canada East. Estimates of their proportion of the population between 1851 and 1861 are 75% of the total population, with around 20% of the remaining population largely composed of English-speaking citizens of British or Irish descent. From 1871 to 1931, the relative size of the French-speaking population stayed much the same, rising to a peak of 80.2% of Quebec&#x27;s population in 1881. The proportion of citizens of British descent declined slightly in contrast, from a peak of 20.4% of the population in 1871, to 15% by 1931. Other minorities made up the remainder of the population of the province.

After several years of negotiations, in 1867 the British Parliament passed the British North America Acts, by which the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the Dominion of Canada. Canada East became the Province of Quebec. Canada remained self-governing locally, but the British continued to control its external affairs.

After having fought as a Patriote at the Battle of Saint-Denis in 1837, George-Étienne Cartier joined the ranks of the Fathers of Confederation and submitted the &quot;72 resolutions&quot; of the Quebec Conference of 1864 approved for the establishment of a federated state -Quebec- whose territory was to be limited to the region which corresponded to the historic heart of the French Canadian nation and where French Canadians would most likely retain majority status. In the future, Quebec as a political entity would act as a form of protection against cultural assimilation and would serve as a vehicle for the national affirmation of the French-Canadian collective to the face of a Canadian state that would, over time, become dominated by Anglo-American culture. Despite this, the objectives of the new federal political regime were going to serve as great obstacles to the assertion of Quebec and the political power given to the provinces would be restricted. Quebec, economically weakened, would have to face political competition from Ottawa, the capital of the strongly centralizing federal state. On July 15, 1867, Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau became Quebec&#x27;s first Premier.

=== Grande Hémorragie ===
In the 1820s and 1830s, rapid demographic growth made access to land in Lower Canada increasingly difficult for young people. Crop failures and political repression in 1838–1839 placed an additional strain on the agricultural sector in the southern part of the colony. Only slowly did French Canadian farmers adapt to competition and new economic realities. According to some contemporary observers, their farming methods were outdated. About this time the textile industry in New England experienced a boom. With living conditions so harsh, and work very hard to find even in the largest city, Montreal, emigration seemed the only option for many. As the first wave moved out in the 1850s, word of mouth soon began to move larger crowds by the late 1870s. Mill owners hired these French immigrants to staff their mills more cheaply than American and Irish-born workers, who were themselves displaced.
When the first wave of emigrants left Quebec, the local government did not pay much attention as the numbers were relatively small. However, when the emigration began to increase and the provincial economy was going through a depression, leaders of the province attempted to halt the emigration. Though a small group of intellectuals believed French-Canadian culture could be recreated or maintained on U.S. soil, many more elites warned against emigration; they argued that cultural and moral perdition would occur south of the border. Instead they proposed domestic colonization in Quebec and the development of the St. Lawrence River valley&#x27;s periphery. Nevertheless, more than 200,000 left between 1879 and 1901.

=== Growth of Montreal ===
Urban expansion characterized Montreal around the time of Confederation, as rural French Canadians moved to the city to find work. Immigrants flocked to Montreal, Canada&#x27;s largest city at the time, and so did many people from other parts of Canada. Major business and financial institutions were established in Montreal, including the headquarters of several national banks and corporations. Prominent businessmen included brewer and politician John Molson Jr., jeweller Henry Birks, and insurer James Bell Forsyth. Montreal&#x27;s population grew rapidly, from around 9000 in 1800, to 23,000 in 1825, and 58,000 in 1852. By 1911, the population was over 528,000. The City of Montreal annexed many neighbouring communities, expanding its territory fivefold between 1876 and 1918. As Montreal was the financial center of Canada during this era, it was the first Canadian city to implement new innovations, like electricity, streetcars and radio.
=== Influence of the Catholic institutions ===
Many aspects of life for French-speaking Quebeckers remained dominated by the Catholic Church in the decades following 1867. The Church operated many of the institutions of the province, including most French-language schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. The leader of the Catholic Church in Quebec was the Bishop of Montreal, and from 1840 to 1876 this was Ignace Bourget, an opponent of liberalism. Bourget eventually succeeded in gaining more influence than the liberal, reformist Institut Canadien. At his most extreme, Bourget went so far as to deny a Church burial to Joseph Guibord, a member of the Institut, in 1874. A court decision forced Bourget to allow Guibord to be buried in a Catholic cemetery, but Bourget deconsecrated the burial plot of ground, and Guibord was buried under army protection. The conservative approach of the Catholic Church was the major force in Quebec society until the reforms of the Quiet Revolution during the 1960s. In 1876, Pierre-Alexis Tremblay was defeated in a federal by-election because of pressure from the Church on voters, but succeeded in getting his loss annulled with the help of a new federal law. He quickly lost the subsequent election. In 1877, the Pope sent representatives to force the Quebecois Church to minimize its interventions in the electoral process.

Catholic women started dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by dowries provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, homes for unwed mothers, and schools. In the first half of the twentieth century, about 2-3% of Quebec&#x27;s young women became nuns; there were 6,600 in 1901 and 26,000 in 1941. In Quebec in 1917, 32 different teaching orders operated 586 boarding schools for girls. At that time there was no public education for girls in Quebec beyond elementary school. The first hospital was founded in 1701. In 1936, the nuns of Quebec operated 150 institutions, with 30,000 beds to care for the long-term sick, the homeless, and orphans. Between 1870 and 1950, thousands of young girls were sent to Quebec City, to the reform school (1870–1921) and the industrial school (1884–1950) of the Hospice St-Charles, both operated by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.

Lionel Groulx wanted to build a nationalistic French-Canadian identity, in purpose to protect the power of the Church and dissuade the public from popular-rule and secularist views. Groulx propagated French-Canadian nationalism and argued that maintaining a Roman Catholic Quebec was the only means to &#x27;emancipate the nation against English power.&#x27; He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used within Confederation, to bolster provincial autonomy (and thus Church power), and advocated it would benefit the French-Canadian nation economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. Groulx successfully promoted Québécois nationalism and the ultra-conservative Catholic social doctrine, to which the Church would maintain dominance in political and social life in Quebec. In the 1920s–1950s, this form of traditionalist Catholic nationalism became known as clerico-nationalism.

=== Politics ===
The 1885 execution in Saskatchewan of Métis rebel leader Louis Riel resulted in protests in Quebec, as the French Canadians thought they were being deliberately persecuted for their religion and language. Honoré Mercier became the outspoken leader of the protest movement. The federal Cabinet members of the Quebec Conservative Party had reluctantly supported Prime Minister Macdonald&#x27;s decision in favour of execution. Support for Conservatives eroded.

Seizing the opportunity to build a coalition of his Liberals and dissident Conservatives, Mercier revived the &quot;Parti National&quot; name for the 1886 Quebec provincial election, and won a majority of seats. However, the coalition consisted of mostly Liberals and only a few Conservatives, so the &quot;Liberal&quot; name was soon reinstituted. The Conservatives, reduced to a minority in the Legislative Assembly, clung to power for a few more months. Mercier became Premier of Quebec in 1887. Seeing provincial autonomy as the political expression of Quebec nationalism, he collaborated with Ontario premier Oliver Mowat to roll back federal centralism.

With his strong nationalist stance, Mercier was very much a precursor of later nationalist premiers in future decades who confronted the federal government and tried to win more power for Quebec. He promoted contacts with francophones in other parts of North America outside of Quebec including Western Canada and New England. Those francophones had not yet been assimilated into the English-Canadian or American culture. Mercier promoted reform, economic development, Catholicism, and the French language. He was returned to the legislature as the Member for the district of Bonaventure and his party won the 1890 election with an increased majority. He was defeated in 1892.

In 1896, Wilfrid Laurier became the first French Canadian to become Prime Minister of Canada. Educated in both French and English, Laurier remained in office as Prime Minister until October 1911. Laurier had several notable political achievements in Quebec, among them winning Quebec votes for the Liberal Party, against the desires of the powerful Catholic clergy.

In 1899, Henri Bourassa was outspoken against the British government&#x27;s request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War. Laurier&#x27;s compromise was to send a volunteer force, but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the world wars. Bourassa challenged, unsuccessfully, the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire. He led the opposition to mandatory conscription during World War I, arguing that Canada&#x27;s interests were not at stake. He opposed Catholic bishops who defended military support of Britain and its allies.

=== Boundary extensions ===
As more provinces joined Canadian Confederation, there was a pressing need to formalize provincial boundaries. In 1898, the Canadian Parliament enacted the &quot;Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898&quot;, which gave Quebec a part of Rupert&#x27;s Land, which Canada had bought from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1870. This Act expanded the boundaries of Quebec northward. In 1912, the Canadian Parliament enacted the &quot;Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912&quot;, which gave Quebec another part of Rupert&#x27;s Land: the District of Ungava. This extended the borders of Quebec northward all the way to the Hudson Strait.

Population migration also characterized life in late 19th century Quebec. In the late 19th century, overpopulation in the Saint Lawrence Valley led many Quebeckers to immigrate to the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region, the Laurentides, and New England, providing a link with that region that continues to this day. In 1909, the government passed a law obligating wood and pulp to be transformed in Quebec. This helped slow the Grande Hémorragie by allowing Quebec to export its finished products to the US instead of its labour force. Clerico-nationalists eventually started to fall out of favour in the federal elections of 1911.

In 1927, the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council drew a clear border between northeast Quebec and south Labrador. However, the Quebec government did not recognize the ruling of this council, resulting in a boundary dispute. The Quebec-Labrador boundary dispute is still ongoing today, leading some to comment that Quebec&#x27;s borders are the most imprecise in the Americas.

== Early 20th century Quebec (1915–1959) ==

=== First World War ===

When World War I broke out, Canada was automatically involved as a Dominion. Many English Canadians voluntarily enlisted to fight. Unlike English Canadians, who felt a connection to the British Empire, French Canadians felt no connection to anyone in Europe. Furthermore, Canada was not threatened by the enemy, who was an ocean away and uninterested in conquering Canada. So, French Canadians saw no reason to fight. Nevertheless, a few French Canadians did enlist in the 22nd Battalion - precursor to the Royal 22e Regiment. By late 1916, the horrific number of casualties were beginning to cause reinforcement problems. After enormous difficulty in the federal government, because virtually every French-speaking MP opposed conscription while almost all the English-speaking MPs supported it, the &quot;Military Service Act&quot; became law on August 29, 1917. French Canadians protested in what is now called the Conscription Crisis of 1917. The conscription protests grew so much that they eventually led to the of 1918.

=== Great Depression ===
The worldwide Great Depression that began in 1929 hit Quebec hard, as exports, prices, profits and wages plunged and unemployment soared to 30%, and even higher in lumbering and mining districts. Politically there was a move to the right, as Quebec&#x27;s leaders noted that across the globe the failures attributed to capitalism and democracy had led to the spread of socialism, totalitarianism, and Civil War. The Spanish Civil War in particular alarmed devout Catholics, who demanded that Canada keep out representatives of the anti-Catholic Loyalist government of Spain. There was a wave of clericalism and Quebec nationalism that represented a conservative reaction of a traditional society which feared social change as a threat to its survival.

With so many men unemployed or on lower wages, it was a major challenge for housewives to cope with the shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women&#x27;s domestic labour—cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare—was essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws. Half the devout Catholics defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births—the number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940.

The populist poet Emile Coderre (1893–1970), writing as &quot;Jean Narrache&quot; gave voice to the poor people of Montreal as they struggled for survival during the Great Depression. Writing in the language of the street, Narrache adopted the persona of a man living in poverty who reflects on the ironies attending the meagerness of social assistance, the role of class, the pretensions of the commercial elite, and the counterfeit philanthropy of the rich.

There was political alienation as more and more voters complained of the indifference and incompetence of both the national leadership of Prime Minister Bennett and the Conservative party, as well as the provincial leadership of Liberal Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. Many of the discontented gravitated toward the ultramontane nationalists especially Henri Bourassa, editor of &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, and the highly traditional Catholic writer Lionel Groulx, editor of &quot;L&#x27;action canadienne-française&quot;. Building on this disenchantment, Maurice Duplessis led the new &quot;Union nationale&quot; party to victory in 1936 with 58% of the vote and became premier.

=== Second World War ===

Prosperity returned with the Second World War, as demand soared for the province&#x27;s manpower, raw materials and manufactures. 140,000 young men, both Francophone and Anglophone, rushed to enlist, although English was the dominant language in all the services and essential for promotion.

Duplessis expected to ride antiwar sentiment to victory when he called an election in the fall of 1939. He miscalculated as the Liberals scored a landslide, with 70 seats to only 14 for the &quot;Union nationale.&quot;

Canadian leaders managed to avoid the depths of the conscription crisis that had soured relations between Anglophones and Francophones during the First World War. During the Conscription Crisis of 1944 Quebecers protested the conscription. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King tried, but did not succeed in, avoiding full conscription in Canada, and it became a reality in the final months of World War II. However, the end of the war also meant the end of the crisis. MacKenzie King succeeded in portraying himself as &quot;a moderate&quot;, and at the same time &quot;limited the ethnic bitterness&quot; that had marked the 1917 conscription crisis.

=== Grande Noirceur (1936–1959)===
Duplessis returned as premier in the 1944 election, and held power without serious opposition for the next fifteen years, until his death, winning elections in 1948, 1952 and 1956. He became known simply as &quot;le Chef&quot; (&quot;the boss&quot;). He championed rural areas, provincial rights, and anti-Communism, and opposed the trade unions, modernizers and intellectuals. He worked well with the powerful Anglo businessmen who controlled most of the economy. A highly controversial figure even today, Duplessis and his Union Nationale party dominated the province. Duplessis&#x27; years in power have been ridiculed as the &quot;La Grande Noirceur&quot; (&quot;Great Darkness&quot;) by his opponents. The Duplessis years were ones of close church-state relations. Quebec society remained culturally insular during this period, in contrast to the modernizing influences sweeping through the rest of North America. Traditional Catholic morality and Church doctrine defined many aspects of daily life, highlighting traditionalism. For example, most schools and hospitals were Church-controlled. Births outside marriage were rare, abortion was illegal, and divorce was not fully legalized in Quebec until 1968. In recent years, many people in Quebec have spoken out about exploitation by Church and government institutions during the Duplessis years, such as the tragedy of the Duplessis Orphans.

Agitation for reform came from liberal Quebeckers during the Duplessis years, although such provocative attitudes were often frowned upon and marginalized. In 1948, a collective of artists calling themselves Les Automatistes published , meaning &quot;total refusal&quot;. The pamphlet was an attempt to start a new vision of Quebec. It has been described as &quot;an anti-religious and anti-establishment manifesto and one of the most influential social and artistic documents in modern Quebec history&quot;. It would have a lasting impact, influencing the supporters of Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution during the 1960s.

Other signs of frustration with the status quo appeared with the bitter Asbestos Strike of 1949. It led to a greater appreciation of labour and social-democratic issues in Quebec.

In fall of 1950 Rivière-du-Loup was the site of a nuclear accident. A USAF B-50 was returning a nuclear bomb to the USA. The bomb was released due to engine troubles, and then was destroyed in a non-nuclear detonation before it hit the ground. The explosion scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of uranium (U-238).

In 1936, Maurice Duplessis hung a crucifix in the National Assembly of Quebec. It hung there for 83 years, until it was removed on 10 July 2019.

The Union Nationale, often had the active support of the Roman Catholic Church during political campaigns, using the slogan &quot;Le ciel est bleu; l&#x27;enfer est rouge&quot; (&quot;Heaven is blue; hell is red&quot;; red is the colour of the Liberal party, and blue was the colour of the Union Nationale).

===Quiet Revolution (1960–1980)===
During the 1960s, the Quiet Revolution ushered in an array of socio-political transformations, from secularism and the welfare state to a specifically Québécois national identity. The baby boom generation embraced the changes that liberalized social attitudes in the province.

In 1960, the Liberal Party of Quebec was brought to power with a two-seat majority, having campaigned with the slogan &quot;&quot; (&quot;Its time for things to change&quot;). This new Jean Lesage government had the &quot;team of thunder&quot;: René Lévesque, Paul Gérin-Lajoie, Georges-Émile Lapalme and Marie-Claire Kirkland-Casgrain. This government made many reforms in the fields of social policy, education, health and economic development. It also created the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Labour Code, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Education, Office québécois de la langue française, Régie des rentes and Société générale de financement.

The Quiet Revolution was particularly characterized by the 1962 Liberal Party&#x27;s slogan &quot; (&quot;Masters in our own house&quot;), which, to the Anglo-American conglomerates that dominated the economy and natural resources of Quebec, announced a collective will for freedom of the French-Canadian people.

Confrontations between the lower clergy and the laity began. As a result, state institutions began to deliver services without the assistance of the church, and many parts of civil society began to be more secular. During the Second Vatican Council, the reform of Quebec&#x27;s institutions was overseen and supported by the Holy See. In 1963, Pope John XXIII proclaimed the encyclical , establishing human rights. In 1964, the confirmed that the laity had a particular role in the &quot;management of &quot;.

In 1965, the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism wrote a preliminary report underlining Quebec&#x27;s distinct character, and promoted open federalism, a political attitude guaranteeing Quebec to a minimum amount of consideration. To favour Quebec during its Quiet Revolution, Canada, through Lester B. Pearson, adopted a policy of open federalism. In 1966, the Union Nationale was re-elected and continued on with major reforms.
The upheavals of the 1960s were also a time of conflict for some in Quebec. The emergence of extremist nationalist violence marked a dark chapter in the province&#x27;s history, when in 1963, the first bombs of the Front de libération du Québec were detonated in Montreal. A major recognition of Quebec&#x27;s cultural importance came in 1964 when, under authority granted by the Government of Canada, the Province of Quebec signed its first international agreement in Paris. The same year, during an official visit by the Queen, the police were required to maintain order during a demonstration by members of the Quebec separatist movement.

To favour Quebec during its Quiet Revolution, Lester B. Pearson adopted a policy of open federalism. In 1966, the Union Nationale was re-elected and continued on with major reforms.

In 1967, President of France Charles de Gaulle visited Quebec, the first French head of state to do so, to attend Expo 67. There, he addressed a crowd of more than 100,000, making a speech ending with the exclamation: &quot;Vive le Québec libre!&quot; (&quot;Long live free Quebec&quot;). This declaration had a profound effect on Quebec by bolstering the burgeoning modern Quebec sovereignty movement and resulting in a political crisis between France and Canada. Following this, various civilian groups developed, sometimes confronting public authority, for example in the October Crisis of 1970. The meetings of the Estates General of French Canada in November 1967 marked a tipping point where relations between francophones of America, and especially francophones of Canada, ruptured. This breakdown greatly affected Quebec society&#x27;s evolution.

In 1968, class conflicts and changes in mentalities intensified. That year, Option Quebec sparked a constitutional debate on the political future of the province by pitting federalist and sovereignist doctrines against each other. In 1969, the federal Official Languages Act was passed to introduce a linguistic context conducive to Quebec&#x27;s development. In 1973, the liberal government of Robert Bourassa initiated the James Bay Project on La Grande River which expanded the capacity of Hydro-Québec by creating one of the largest hydro-electric projects in the world. In 1974, it enacted the Official Language Act, which made French the official language of Quebec. In 1975, it established the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement.

=== Expo 67 ===
The 1960s were largely a time of optimism in Quebec. Expo 67 marked Montreal&#x27;s pinnacle as Canada&#x27;s largest and most important city and prompted the construction of what is now Parc Jean Drapeau and the Montreal Metro. In 1962, the mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau (the man who later was behind Expo 67 and the &#x27;76 Olympics projects) instigated the construction of the Metro (subway). The first phase of the subway was completed in 1966. These mega-projects came in the same era as Canada&#x27;s Confederation centennial celebrations in 1967, when a wave of patriotism swept through most of Canada.

===Religion and culture===
In the midst of the powerful and urban changes, cultural change took root as well. Quebec was greatly affected by the baby boom; between 1960 and 1970, more than 1.2 million Quebeckers reached the age of 14. As more young Québécois rejected Catholic teachings, they made life choices that were a complete change from tradition in the province. Cohabitation rates among young couples rose, as the institution of marriage gradually lost its obligatory status. Births outside of marriage began to rise, from 3.7 percent in 1961 to 10 percent in 1976, then 22 percent by 1984. As of 2015, 62.9% of births were outside of marriage.
Student protests at local universities erupted, mirroring the youth protests throughout the United States and Western Europe during the 1960s and early 1970s. Reforms included an expansion of post-secondary educational opportunities for both English- and French-speaking Quebeckers. In 1968, the Université du Québec à Montréal opened. Protests by English-speaking students led to the establishment of Concordia University in Montreal that same year. The Quiet Revolution combined declericalization with the Church reforms of Vatican II. There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns. Many left the convent while very few young women entered. The Provincial government took over the nuns&#x27; traditional role as provider of many of Quebec&#x27;s educational and social services. Ex-nuns often continued the same roles in civilian dress, and men for the first time started entering the teaching profession.

With the Quiet Revolution, Quebeckers affirmed their identity, especially in the arts, culture and language. It was during the revolution that the government of Quebec formed the Ministry of Culture which focused mainly on defending the French language and culture. The transformation of Quebec was also marked by the adoption of the Law on the assurance-hospitalisation, guaranteeing universal health care through a tax-funded public delivery system. In 1964, Quebec had recognized the equality between men and women and allows all women to have jobs which were once exclusively for men.

===Politics and independence===
The growth of Quebec&#x27;s government bureaucracy and its perceived interventionism produced friction with the federal government, particularly since the federal government followed a policy of close centralization.

English-speaking Canada showed concern at the changes happening in Quebec society and the protests of the Québécois. In 1963, Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson, asked the famous question, &quot;What does Quebec want?&quot; as he instituted a royal commission of enquiry into bilingualism and biculturalism to find an answer for this question, and to propose measures to satisfy the demands of the Québécois. French-speaking communities beyond Quebec were also pushing for increased linguistic and cultural accommodations; in 1965 the report of the Laurendeau-Dunton royal commission recommended making French an official language in the parliaments of Canada, the provincial assemblies of Ontario and New Brunswick, in federal tribunals and in all federal government administration of Canada.

The implementation of the proposed measures only increased the divide between English Canada and Quebec francophones. English Canadians considered the measures put in place to be unacceptable concessions, while francophones considered the measures an insufficient response.

Frictions with English popularized the idea of independence from Canada.

In 1967, René Lévesque quit the Quebec Liberal Party and founded the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association. The Ralliement national (RN), led by Gilles Grégoire, and the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN), led by Pierre Bourgault and Hubert Aquin, were founded in 1960 and quickly became political parties. In 1967, René Lévesque, who until then had been a leading figure in the Liberal Party of Quebec, quit the Liberals to found the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association (MSA).

In 1968, the sovereignists reorganized into a single political party, the Parti Québécois, under the leadership of René Lévesque. Pro-independence parties gained 8% of the popular vote in Quebec in 1966, 23% in 1970 and 30% in 1973.

During an official visit to Quebec as a guest of the government of Canada, in front of a huge crowd the President of France, Colonel Charles de Gaulle, who had been temporarily given the rank of general in WWII, undiplomatically declared from the balcony of the Montreal city hall; &quot;Vive le Québec libre!&quot; (Long live free Quebec!). The Canadian federal government strongly took offence. De Gaulle abruptly cancelled his visit to Ottawa and went home.

Violence erupted in 1970 with the October Crisis, when &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot; members kidnapped British Trade Commissioner James Cross and Quebec Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte. Pierre Laporte was later found murdered. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau used the War Measures Act, which allowed anyone suspected of being involved with the terrorists to be held temporarily without charge.

===Economic burden===
During this time period, several factors contributed to the stagnation or reduction of the buying power of Québécois:
*the gas price shocks of 1973–1974 and of 1979 generated price inflation and high interest rates;
*taxes increased to pay for government programs put in place during the period 1960–1975;
*governments, struggling with spending and growing deficits, disengaged itself from some services that citizens now had to pay for out of their own pocket;
*globalization of the economy put downward pressure on salaries.

===1980 referendum===
In 1976, the separatist Parti Québécois under René Lévesque was elected, and formed the first separatist government of the province. The Parti Québécois promised in its campaign that it would not declare independence without obtaining a mandate through a referendum. The mandate of the Parti Québécois was to govern the province well, and not to bring about independence. The first years of the Parti Québécois government were very productive and the government passed progressive laws that were well accepted by the majority of the population, such as French language protection laws, a law on the financing of political parties, laws for compensating road accident victims, for protecting farm land, and many other social-democracy-type laws. Even opponents of the Parti Québécois occasionally acknowledged that the Party governed the province well.

On May 20, 1980, the first referendum was held on sovereignty-association, but was rejected by a majority of 60 percent (59.56% &quot;No&quot;, 40.44% &quot;Yes&quot;). Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of anglophones and immigrants voted against, and that francophones were almost equally divided.

===Constitution Act of 1982===
Together with the Canada Act 1982, an Act of Parliament passed by the British Parliament severed virtually all remaining constitutional and legislative ties between the United Kingdom and Canada. The Act was signed by all the provinces except Quebec.

On the night of November 4, 1981, (widely known among Quebec sovereigntists as &quot;La nuit des longs couteaux&quot; and in the rest of Canada as the &quot;Kitchen Accord&quot;) Federal Justice Minister Jean Chrétien met with all of the provincial premiers except René Lévesque to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the &quot;fait accompli&quot; to Lévesque. Lévesque refused to sign the document and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec&#x27;s signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). Quebec is the only province not to have formally assented to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982.

=== Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord ===

Between 1982 and 1992, the Quebec government&#x27;s attitude changed to prioritize reforming the federation. The subsequent attempts at constitutional amendments by the Mulroney and Bourassa governments ended in failure with both the Meech Lake Accord of 1987 and the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, resulting in the creation of the Bloc Québécois.

===1995 referendum===
On October 30, 1995, a second referendum for Quebec sovereignty was rejected by a slim margin (50.58% &quot;No&quot;, 49.42% &quot;Yes&quot;). Instrumental leaders of the Quebec separatist side were Lucien Bouchard and Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau. Bouchard had left the senior ranks of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government to form Canada&#x27;s first federal separatist party (the Bloc Québécois) in 1991 and had become the leader of the Opposition after the 1993 federal election. He campaigned heavily for the &quot;Yes&quot; side against Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, a major proponent of the federalist &quot;No&quot; side. Parizeau, a longtime separatist who had played an important role in the 1980 referendum, promised a referendum for sovereignty in his electoral campaign leading up to the 1994 provincial election, which had earned him a majority government in the province. In the aftermath of the referendum, he faced criticism when he blamed the loss of the referendum on &quot;money and the ethnic vote&quot; in his concession speech. Parizeau resigned as Premier and as leader of the Parti québécois the day after his controversial speech, claiming he had always planned to do so in the case of separatist defeat, and Bouchard left federal politics to replace him in January 1996.

Federalists accused the sovereigntist side of asking a vague, overcomplicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:

&quot;Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?&quot;
In 1998, following the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s decision on the reference relating to the secession of Quebec, the Parliaments of Canada and Quebec defined the legal frameworks within which their respective governments would act in another referendum.

== 21st century Quebec (2000–present) ==
On October 30, 2003, the National Assembly voted unanimously to affirm &quot;that the people of Québec form a nation&quot;.

After winning the provincial election in 1998, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. Bernard Landry was then appointed leader of the Parti Québécois and premier of Quebec. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the Quebec Liberal Party and Jean Charest. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, André Boisclair was elected to succeed him.

On November 27, 2006, the House of Commons of Canada passed a motion recognizing that the &quot;Québécois form a nation within a united Canada.&quot; The motion was introduced in the House of Commons by the federal government.

In January 2007, the town of Hérouxville received attention when it approved a code of conduct for immigrants, which occurred in the context of a debate on &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; for other cultures in Quebec. This would start a debate which would lead to the Parti Québécois Quebec Charter of Values.Quebec elected Pauline Marois as its first female premier on September 4, 2012. Marois served as leader of the Parti Québécois.

During the 2011 Canadian federal elections, Quebec voters rejected the sovereignist Bloc Québécois in favour of the federalist and previously minor New Democratic Party (NDP). As the NDP&#x27;s logo is orange, this event was called the &quot;orange wave&quot;.

Marois called a provincial election for April 2014, during which her party was defeated by the Parti libéral du Québec (PLQ). The PLQ won by a large margin, securing a majority government. In the 2018 Quebec general election, the Coalition Avenir Québec defeated the Liberals, forming a majority government. François Legault is the current Premier.

In January 2017, A Quebec City mosque was the subject of a mass shooting. There were six deaths and numerous others injured.

In May 2017, floods spread across southern Quebec, with Montreal declaring a state of emergency.

In 2018, the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), led by François Legault, won the provincial general elections.This marked the first time since the 1966 election, which was won by the now-defunct Union Nationale, that a party other than the Quebec Liberals or the Parti Québécois formed government in Quebec.

In June 2019, Quebec passed Bill 21, a law which bars public servants from wearing religious symbols while on duty.

In the 2019 Canadian federal election, The Bloc Québécois increased its number of seats from 10 in 2015, to 32 seats in 2019, both over taking the NDP to become the third largest party in Canada and regaining official party status.

Between 2020 and 2021, Quebec took measures to protect itself against the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, the provincial legislature passed &quot;An Act respecting French, the official and common language of Québec&quot;. This act expanded the requirement to speak French in many public and private settings and reinforced French as the language of legislation, justice, civil administration, professional orders, employers, commerce and business, and educational instruction.

The Coalition Avenir Québec Government increased its parliamentary majority in the 2022 Quebec general election.

<doc id="396729" wikidata="Q8025576" url="?curid=396729" title="Winnemucca Lake">
<text>Winnemucca Lake is a dry lake bed in northwest Nevada that features the oldest known petroglyphs in North America. Located astride the border between Washoe and Pershing counties, it was a shallow lake until the 1930s, but was dried when a dam and a road were built that combined to restrict and block water flow. It was formerly designated as a National Wildlife Refuge, but its status as a refuge was removed due to the lack of water.

Winnemucca Lake is home to several petroglyphs long believed to be very old. In 2013, researchers dated the carvings to between 14,800 and 10,500 years ago. Either date would make them the oldest known petroglyphs found in North America. The carvings lie within the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.

Note: There is another lake, having the same name of &quot;Winnemucca Lake&quot; in California, near the Carson pass (coordinates: 38°40&#x27;10.80&quot;N, 119°59&#x27;36.59&quot;W).

==Geography==
Winnemucca Lake is a sub-basin within the Lahontan Basin in northwestern Nevada. It lies east of Pyramid Lake and is on the dividing line between Washoe and Pershing counties. The lake bed lies between the Lake Range on the west and the Nightingale Mountains and Selenite Range to the east. Winnemucca Lake is about long and about wide. The lake bed is at an elevation of , which is below the water level of adjacent Pyramid Lake.

==History==
Winnemucca Lake may have been dry when John Frémont came through in 1843–44.
Frémont&#x27;s 1844 map indicates that he traveled to the west of Winnemucca Lake and does not map the Winnemucca Lake valley.
The Elko Free Press reports that there was a flood in 1862 that filled the lake to , but Russell states that the level was low in 1862.

In 1865, Winnemucca Lake (then known as Mud Lake) was the site of the Battle of Mud Lake where 29 soldiers from the 1st Nevada Volunteer Cavalry Battalion led by Captain Almond B. Wells (and two civilian guides) killed 29 Smoke Creek Indians. At least two of those killed were women, possibly more. Sarah Winnemucca wrote &quot;I had one baby brother killed there. My sister jumped on father&#x27;s best horse and ran away. As she ran the soldiers ran after her but thanks be to the Good Father in the Spirit land my dear sister got away. This almost killed my poor papa.&quot;

The maximum level of the lake was in the 1880s

Winnemucca Lake was a shallow tule-filled lake and an important stop for migrating waterfowl. After the Derby Dam was built on the Truckee River in 1903 (the first project of the Reclamation Act), and State Route 447 (which blocked the slough connecting it to Pyramid Lake) was built, Winnemucca Lake dried out and has remained seasonally dry since the late 1930s. 
In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Migratory Bird Conservation Act to create the Winnemucca Migratory Bird Refuge as a &quot;refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife.&quot; In 1940, the name was changed to the Winnemucca National Wildlife Refuge. In 1962, the refuge designation was removed, making this area the first refuge designation lost because of lack of water.

==Petroglyphs==
The western end of Winnemucca Lake is home to several boulders carved with petroglyphs that lie within the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation. The site, officially designated 26Wa3329, was first described by Connick and Connick in 1992. The team, Frances and Robert E. Connick, classified it as unusual, and possibly very early. In 1994, geochemist Larry Benson determined the designs had been carved into a branch form of tufa, a type of limestone. The research showed that the limestone was deposited between 16,200 and 14,800 years ago, but no specific date for the carvings was suggested.

In 2013, a team of researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder (including Benson) collected carbonate crust and shallow-water algal formations from the site. They then used radiocarbon dating strontium isotope analysis and total inorganic carbon data from a core in Pyramid Lake to establish a window of when the lake level was low enough to allow access to the rocks. Sedimentary cores were collected from nearby Pyramid Lake and subjected to analysis to determine rise and fall of the waterline over time. More precise methods of dating would have required taking scrapings from the grooves of the petroglyphs, which was not allowed by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. However, Benson was allowed to use non-invasive techniques to examine the petroglyphs that allowed him to work to the side of the carvings. The research was published in the &quot;Journal of Archaeological Science&quot;.

Dating of the lowest (newest) carbonate crust yielded a date of 10,200 to 9,800 years ago. The algal formation dating suggested the waterline was sufficiently low from 12,600 to 11,400 years ago. The sedimentary core analysis of Pyramid Lake showed the waterline began to fall about 15,000 years ago, reaching a low approximately 13,300 years ago. At about 13,200 years ago it rose again, and had intermittent low periods thereafter (from 11,300 to 10,500 according to one method, or from 11,500 to 11,100 according to another). The broad consistencies among the various dating methods allowed the research team to conclude the petroglyph rocks were above the waterline, and thus available for carving, from 14,800 and 13,200 years ago and between 11,300 and 10,500 years ago. Additionally, the younger date range is consistent with the date of textiles previously found within the Winnemucca sub-basin (dated as old as 10,700 years ago) and the date of various human artifacts previously found within the Lahontan Basin (dated from 11,000 to 10,400 years ago). The younger dates also align with the estimated age of the Spirit Cave mummy found nearby. Either date range would make the petroglyphs the oldest found in North America to date. The older date would roughly correspond to the estimated time of the first human migrations into North America and to remains found in Paisley Cave, Oregon. Previously, the oldest carvings in North America were thought to be those estimated to be 7,300 years old found at Long Lake, in Oregon.

The rocks include both simple petroglyphs such as straight lines and swirls and more complex petroglyphs that resemble trees, flowers, or the veins of a leaf. There also is an intricate diamond pattern on one rock. The smallest are approximately in width, while the largest are . Grooves are approximately deep. The carvings are deeper and larger than those typically found in the Southwestern United States. The meaning of the carvings is unknown. The Connick team suggested the petroglyphs may represent meteorological symbols such as clouds and lightning. Benson&#x27;s team suggests the Winnemucca Lake petroglyphs share several distinctive features in common with the Long Lake petroglyphs that are not found in more recent petroglyphs.

How the petroglyphs were created is not known. One possibility is that hard volcanic rock was used to chip away at the softer carbonate formations on the boulders.

<text>Field Marshal Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 3rd Duke of Lennox, 3rd Duke of Aubigny, (22 February 1735 – 29 December 1806), styled Earl of March until 1750, of Goodwood House in Sussex and of Richmond House in London, was a British Army officer and politician. He associated with the Rockingham Whigs and rose to hold the post of Southern Secretary for a brief period. He was noteworthy for his support for the colonists during the American Revolutionary War, his support for a policy of concession in Ireland and his advanced views on the issue of parliamentary reform. He is believed by many to be the source of the second parchment copy of the US Declaration of Independence, known as the &#x27;Sussex Declaration&#x27;. He went on to be a reforming Master-General of the Ordnance first in the Rockingham ministry and then in the ministry of William Pitt the Younger.

==Origins==
He was the son and heir of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, of Goodwood and of Richmond House, by his wife Sarah Cadogan, a daughter of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan.

==Career==
He was educated at Westminster School and Leiden University and succeeded his father as Duke of Richmond in August 1750. He was commissioned as an ensign in the 2nd Foot Guards in March 1752, promoted to captain in the 20th Regiment of Foot on 18 June 1753 and was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 December 1755.

Richmond became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 33rd Regiment of Foot on 7 June 1756. A second battalion (2nd/33rd) of this regiment was raised and in 1757, and the following year it became an independent regiment, the 72nd Foot; Richmond was appointed its lieutenant colonel, while his younger brother George took command of the 33rd Regiment (1st/33rd). In May 1758 he became Colonel of the 72nd Regiment.

Richmond took part in the Raid on Cherbourg in August 1758 and served as aide-de-camp to Prince Frederick of Brunswick at the Battle of Minden in August 1759. Promoted to major general on 9 March 1761, he saw the 72nd Regiment disbanded in 1763 at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Sussex on 18 October 1763.

Richmond was appointed British ambassador extraordinary in Paris and made a Privy Counsellor in 1765, and in the following year he briefly served as Southern Secretary in the Rockingham Whig administration, resigning office on the accession of Pitt the Elder in July 1766. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 30 April 1770 and was briefly leader of the parliamentary Whigs in opposition in 1771 when Rockingham&#x27;s wife was ill. Richmond&#x27;s anti-colonial positions earned him the epithet &quot;the radical duke.&quot;

In the debates on the policy that led to the American Revolutionary War Richmond was a firm supporter of the colonists, and he initiated the debate in 1778 calling for the removal of British troops from America, during which Pitt (now the Earl of Chatham) was seized by his fatal illness. Nevertheless, as Lord Lieutenant he raised the Sussex Militia for home defence and took personal command as Colonel (a position he held until 1804, despite his advanced age).

Richmond also advocated a policy of concession in Ireland, with reference to which he originated the phrase &quot;a union of hearts&quot; which long afterwards became famous when his use of it had been forgotten. In 1779 Richmond brought forward a motion for retrenchment of the civil list, and in 1780 he embodied in a bill his proposals for parliamentary reform, which included manhood suffrage, annual parliaments and equal electoral areas. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1787.

Richmond joined the Second Rockingham Ministry as Master-General of the Ordnance in March 1782; he was appointed a Knight of the Garter on 17 April 1782 and promoted to full general on 20 November 1782. He resigned as Master-General when the Fox–North coalition came to power in April 1783.

In January 1784 he joined the First Pitt the Younger Ministry as Master-General of the Ordnance; in this role he reformed the Department, introducing salaries for office holders, starting a survey of the South Coast (which led to the formation of the Ordnance Survey) and introducing new artillery (leading to the formation of the Royal Horse Artillery). 

He now developed strongly Tory opinions, and his alleged desertion of the cause of reform led to accusations of apostasy, and an attack on him by Lord Lauderdale in 1792, which nearly led to a duel. In November 1795, when Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke were charged with treason and cited his publications on reform in their defence, Richmond became a liability to the Government and was dismissed in February 1795. He became colonel of the Royal Horse Guards on 18 July 1795 and was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796. On 15 June 1797 he raised a Yeomanry artillery troop, the Duke of Richmond&#x27;s Light Horse Artillery at his estate at Goodwood. The troop was equipped with his own design of Curricle gun carriage.

In retirement Richmond built the famous racecourse at the family seat of Goodwood. He was also a patron of artists such as George Stubbs, Pompeo Batoni, Anton Raphael Mengs, Joshua Reynolds and George Romney.

==Marriage==

On 1 April 1757, he married Lady Mary Bruce (died 1796), a daughter of Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury, and his third wife, Lady Caroline Campbell. The wedding was held at the house of Major-General Henry Conway in Warwick Street, St James, with the consent of the Major-General, one of Mary&#x27;s guardians, by special licence of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral, given the then vacancy of the See of Canterbury, and performed by Frederick Keppel, then Canon of Windsor and the future Bishop of Exeter. The marriage failed to produce any legitimate issue.

==Mistresses and illegitimate issue==

===Mrs Mary Bennett===
As he acknowledged in his will he had three illegitimate daughters (Elizabeth, Caroline and Mary) by Mrs Mary Bennett (1765–1845), described as &quot;his housekeeper&quot;, also known at sometime as Mrs. Mary Blesard, 30 years his junior. To these daughters he bequeathed the sum of £10,000 each, and to Mrs Bennett he bequeathed his estate in Earl&#x27;s Court, Kensington.
*Mary Bennett, who at the age of 19 married William Light (1786–1839), founder of the City of Adelaide in Australia. 
*Caroline Bennett (9 August 1806 – 5 September 1836), who married her first cousin Henry Edward Napier, son of Colonel Hon. George Napier and Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of the 3rd Duke. He was the author of &quot;Florentine History from the earliest Authentic Records to the Accession of Ferdinand the Third, Grandduke of Tuscany&quot;, and a brother of General Sir Charles James Napier, conqueror of the Sindh. She died at the Villa Capponi in Florence and her inscribed gravestone survives in the &quot;English Cemetery&quot; of the Cimitero di Pinti, Florence, next to that of her mother.

===Vicomtesse de Cambis===
By his French mistress Gabrielle d&#x27;Alsace-Hénin-Liétard (Vicomtesse de Cambis; died 1808), wife of the Comte de Cambis and sister of the Prince de Chimay, he had another illegitimate daughter:

*Henrietta Anne le Clerc (1773–1846), variously called &quot;a protégée of the Duchess&quot; and &quot;a long acknowledged daughter of His Grace&quot;. The 3rd Duke referred to her in his will as &quot;Miss Henrietta Anne le Clerc, who resides with me and though Christened by the name of Anne only, is called Henrietta and whom I have [educated?] from her childhood&quot;, and bequeathed her an annual income of £2,000. In 1778, aged 5, Henriette had been brought from France by the Duke&#x27;s sister Lady Louisa Conolly, to live at Goodwood House. It was in Henrietta&#x27;s bedroom in Richmond House in London where in 1791 the fire started which destroyed that building. By the Duke&#x27;s will she received the life tenure of West Lavant House and Park and other lands and farms on the Goodwood Estate. On 28 March 1808, at St. James&#x27;s Church, Westminster, she married General John Dorrien (1758–1825), Royal Regiment of Horseguards, by whom she had a son, Charles Dorrien. After her husband&#x27;s death she turned to the management of her estate, where she bred Merino sheep and hunted with Colonel Wyndham&#x27;s foxhounds.

==Death, burial and succession==
Richmond died at Goodwood on 29 December 1806 and was buried in nearby Chichester Cathedral in Sussex. As he left no legitimate issue he was succeeded in the peerage by his nephew Charles.

==The Sussex Declaration==
On April 21, 2017, the Declaration Resources Project at Harvard University announced that a second parchment manuscript copy had been discovered at West Sussex Record Office in Chichester, England. Named the &quot;Sussex Declaration&quot; by its finders, Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff, it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders refer to as the &quot;Matlack Declaration&quot;) in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States. How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory James Wilson, who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people. The Sussex Declaration was probably brought to Sussex, England, by Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond.

==Memorials==
Both Richmond County, North Carolina and Richmond County, Georgia are named after him.

<doc id="396731" wikidata="Q1902328" url="?curid=396731" title="Bankes's Horse">
<text>Marocco (c. 1586 – c. 1606), widely known as Bankes&#x27;s Horse (after his trainer William Bankes), was the name of a late 16th- and early 17th-century English performing horse. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dancing Horse&quot;, the &quot;Thinking Horse&quot;, or the &quot;Politic Horse&quot;.

==Origin==
William Bankes (also spelled Banks or Banckes, and sometimes called Richard Bankes) was born in Staffordshire, probably in the early 1560s, In the 1580s he became a retainer of Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex; his job may have been working in the stables.

The horse that would be named Marocco was born around 1586; most sources agree he was bay, but some record him as white. Soon thereafter he was obtained by Bankes, who named him after the morocco leather from which contemporary saddles were made, and jocularly addressed him as &quot;seignior&quot; (&quot;señor&quot;). According to modern English physician and writer Jan Bondeson, &quot;Marocco was a small, muscular horse with remarkable litheness and agility; he also proved particularly intelligent and easy to educate.&quot;

==London==
Bankes sold his possessions and used the money to purchase silver horseshoes for Marocco, then moved to London to work at inn-yard theatres. According to Thomas Nashe, Bankes had Marocco&#x27;s tail bobbed: &quot;Wiser was our Brother Bankes of these latter daies, who made his iugling horse a Cut, for feare if at anie time hee should foyst [defecate], the stinke sticking in his thicke bushie taile might be noysome to his Auditors.&quot; Bankes lived at the Cross Keys Inn on Gracechurch Street, where their act performed. A passage from &quot;Tarlton&#x27;s Jests&quot; (1611) says:

The[re] was one Banks, in the time of Tarlton, who served the Erle of Essex, and had a horse of strange qualities, and being at the Crosse-keyes, in Gracious streete, getting mony with him, as he was mightily resorted to. Tarlton then, with his fellowes, playing at the Bel by, came into the Cross-keyes, amongst many people, to see fashions, which Banks perceiving, to make the people laugh, saies; seignior, to his horse, go fetch me the veryest foole in the company. The jade comes immediately, and with his mouth drawes Tarlton forth. Tarlton with merry words, said nothing but, &quot;God a mercy, horse.&quot; In the end Tarlton, seeing the people laugh so, was angry inwardly, and said: Sir, had I power of your horse as you have, I would doe more than that. What ere it be, said Banks, to please him, I will charge him to do it. Then, said Tarleton: charge him bring me the veriest whore-master in the company. The horse leades his master to him. Then &quot;God a mercy horse indeed,&quot; saies Tarlton, The people had much ado to keep peace; but Banks and Tarlton had like to have squar&#x27;d, and the horse by to give aime. But ever after it was a by word thorow London, God a mercy horse! and is so to this day.
Exactly when Marocco and Bankes moved to London is unknown, but for Richard Tarlton (a renowned clown) to have seen the act, they must have arrived before Tarlton&#x27;s death in September 1588. Bondeson has suggested that the entire episode with Tarlton was staged to garner publicity.

Marocco could walk on two and three legs and play dead. He could pull out particular audience members—such as people wearing spectacles—on Bankes&#x27;s command; he could distinguish between colors, such as green and violet (horses are only partially colorblind). In one stunt, the horse drank a large bucket of water, then urinated on Bankes&#x27;s command. In another, he was told to pick out the &quot;maids&quot; (virgins) from the &quot;maulkins&quot; (harlots) in the audience. When ordered to bow to the queen, Elizabeth I, Marocco was trained to do so; when ordered to bow to Philip II (King of Spain), the horse was trained to bare its teeth, whinny, and chase Bankes offstage. This stunt was soon thereafter imitated by other animal trainers. By 1593, John Donne had written:

&lt;poem&gt;
But to a graue man, he doth moue no more 
Than the wise politique horse would heretofore, 
Or thou, O Elephant, or Ape, wilt doe, 
When any names the k[ing] of Spaine to you.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Whether by sleight-of-hand or by the horse&#x27;s own talent, Marocco was known for his unusual counting abilities. Coins could be collected from the audience, and Marocco would indicate to whom each coin belonged and, with stomps of his hoof, how many coins had come from each. Contemporary poet John Bastard wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;
Bankes hath a horse of wondrous qualitie
For he can fight, and pisse, and daunce, and lie,
And finde your purse, and tell what coyne ye haue:
But &quot;Bankes&quot;, who taught your horse to smel a knaue?
&lt;/poem&gt;

By the mid-1590s Marocco and Bankes had become some of London&#x27;s most popular entertainers; Bankes was now wealthy, living and performing at the Bell Savage Inn, where Marocco was kept in the stables. Eventually Bankes had an arena built on Gracechurch Street just for their act. A musician was employed who played a song called &quot;Bankes&#x27;s Game&quot; during the act, and who entertained the audience between shows. Although the tune and lyrics have not been preserved, the song &quot;The Praise of a Pretty Lass; or, The Young Man&#x27;s Dissimulation&quot;, published sometime in the early 17th century, follows the same tune. The first verse goes:

&lt;poem&gt;
Young men and maidens, to you Ile [I&#x27;ll] declare,
 &quot;I love my love, and she loveth me:&quot;
Yet to no goddesse will I her compare,
And yet she is pretty indifferent faire:
 &quot;Will O, my love, O, there is none doth know&quot;
 &quot;How I doe love thee.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

In addition, a ballad was published on 14 November 1595 by pamphleteer Edward White called &quot;A ballad shewing the strange qualities of a yong nagg called Morocco&quot;, which is now lost.
In 1601, perhaps to fight the growing competition of other animal trainers, Bankes and Marocco ascended over a thousand steps to the rooftop of the then-flat St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and performed the act. The show was a success, and even the clergy came out to watch the performance. Then, to the great astonishment of those watching, Marocco walked down the flight of stairs and out onto the street. Writer Thomas Dekker wrote in &quot;The Guls Hornebooke&quot; (1609):
From hence you may descend to talke about the horse that went up, and striue if you can to know his keeper, take the day of the moneth, and the number of the steppes,—and suffer your selfe to beleeue verily that it was not a horse, but something else in the likeness of one.
==Travels and death==
As the act&#x27;s popularity grew, Bankes took it beyond London. A Scottish historian Patrick Anderson wrote, &quot;There came an Englishman to Edinburgh, with a chestain-coloured naig, which he called Marroco. […] He made him to do many rare and uncouth tricks, such as never horse was observed to do the like before in this land&quot;. A journal entry from Shrewsbury in 1591 relates:
September 1591, 33 Eliz. This yeare and against the assise tyme on Master Banckes, a Staffordshire gentile, brought into this town of Salop a white horsse whiche wolld doe woonderfull and strange thinges, as thesse,—wold in a company or prese tell howe many peeces of money by hys foote were in a mans purce; also, yf the partie his master wolld name any man beinge hyd never so secret in the company, wold fatche hym owt with his mowthe, either naming hym the veriest knave in the company, or what cullerid coate he hadd; he pronowncid further to his horse and said, Sirha, there be two baylyves in the towne, the one of them bid mee welcom unto this towne and usid me in frindly maner; I wold have the goe to hym and gyve hym thanckes for mee; and he wold goe truly to the right baylyf that did so use hys sayd master as he did in the sight of a number of people, unto Master Baylyffe Sherar, and bowyd unto hym in makinge curchey withe hys foote in sutche maner as he coullde, withe suche strange feates for sutche a beast to doe, that many people judgid that it were impossible to be don except he had a famyliar or don by the arte of magicke.
In March 1601, Bankes, Marocco, and their musician travelled to Paris and moved into the Lion d&#x27;Argent Inn on Rue Saint-Jacques. Here Marocco became known as &quot;Monsieur Moraco&quot;, and became immensely popular. A Parisian official finally arrested Bankes and charged him with sorcery, forcing Bankes to reveal that many of the tricks were accomplished through subtle hand gestures.

Marocco, Bankes, and the musician moved on to Orléans, where their show was also met with success until Bankes was again arrested and sentenced to burn at the stake. Bankes was given a last show to redeem himself, and during the performance Marocco knelt down before a cross held by one of the priests of the city, &quot;proving&quot; he was not of the devil. When Bankes left Orléans, he was given &quot;money and great commendations&quot; for his troubles.

Marocco&#x27;s show continued to tour Europe, stopping in Frankfurt, Lisbon, Rome, and Wolfenbüttel as late as 1605. Marocco probably died around 1606. After Marocco&#x27;s death. Bankes revealed the secrets of his training to Gervase Markham, who published them in his book &quot;Cavelarice&quot; (1607).

James VI and I mentioned Bankes and his dancing horse during &quot;The Masque of Indian and China Knights&quot; at Hampton Court on 1 January 1604. In 1608 Bankes was hired to work in James I&#x27;s stables, and later trained horses for George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. He married and had a daughter, and was known for his wealth and wit in his old age. Late in life he became a well known innkeeper, and died c. 1641.

<text>James Watson Cronin (September 29, 1931 – August 25, 2016) was an American particle physicist.

Cronin and co-researcher Val Logsdon Fitch were awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics for a 1964 experiment that proved that certain subatomic reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles. Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of kaons, that a reaction run in reverse does not merely retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the interactions of subatomic particles are not invariant under time reversal. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered.

Cronin received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1976 for major experimental contributions to particle physics including fundamental work on weak interactions culminating in the discovery of asymmetry under time reversal. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.

Cronin was Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago winning the prestigious Quantrell Award and a spokesperson emeritus for the Auger project. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

==Education and early life==
James Cronin was born in Chicago on September 29, 1931. His father, James Farley Cronin, was a graduate student of classical languages at the University of Chicago. After his father had obtained his doctorate the family first moved to Alabama, and later in 1939 to Dallas, Texas, where his father became a professor of Latin and Greek at Southern Methodist University. After high school Cronin stayed in Dallas and obtained an undergraduate degree at SMU in physics and mathematics in 1951. He is of Irish descent, with his Irish ancestors immigrating from County Cork, Ireland.

For graduate school Cronin moved back to Illinois to attend the University of Chicago. His teachers there included Nobel Prize laureates Enrico Fermi, Maria Mayer, Murray Gell-Mann and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He wrote his thesis on experimental nuclear physics under supervision of Samuel K. Allison.

==Research and career==
After obtaining his doctorate in 1955, Cronin joined the group of Rodney L. Cool and Oreste Piccioni at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the new Cosmotron particle accelerator had just been completed. There he started to study parity violation in the decay of hyperon particles. During that time he also met Val Fitch, who brought him to Princeton University in Fall 1958. After Cosmotron underwent magnet failure, Cronin and the Brookhaven group moved to Bevatron at the University of California, Berkeley during the first half of 1958. Cronin and Fitch studied the decays of neutral K mesons, in which they discovered CP violation in 1964. This discovery earned the duo the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics.

After the discovery, Cronin spent a year in France at the Centre d&#x27;Études Nucléaires at Saclay. After returning to Princeton he continued studying the neutral CP violating decay modes of the long-lived neutral K meson. In 1971, he moved back to the University of Chicago to become a full professor. This was attractive for him because of a new 400 GeV particle accelerator being built at nearby Fermilab.

When he moved to Chicago, he began a long series of experiments on particle production at high transverse momentum. With physicist Pierre Piroue and colleagues we learned about many things. These are summarized in Physical Review D, vol 19, page 764 (1977). Following these experiments Cronin took a sabbatical at CERN in 1982–83, where he performed an experiment to measure of the lifetime of the neutral pion (Physics Letters vol 158 B page 81, 1985). He then switched to the study of cosmic rays. The first was a series of measurements looking for point sources of cosmic rays. No sources were found. A summary of the measurements was published in Physical Review D vol 55 page 1714 (1997). In 1998 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah on a half-time basis to work on ultra-high-energy cosmic ray physics and to jumpstart the Pierre Auger Observatory project. His appointment was to last five years, but he left after a year to continue gathering international support for the Observatory with Alan Watson and Murat Boratav.

Cronin is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

==Personal life==
While in graduate school he also met his wife, Annette Martin, whom he married in 1954. She was the Director of Special Events at the University of Chicago. They have three children: two daughters, Cathryn (b. 1955) and Emily (b. 1959), and a son, Daniel (b. 1971). In June 2005 Annette Martin died of complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She was 71.

In November 2006 he married Carol Champlin.

In May 2011 his daughter Cathryn Cranston died of leukemia at age 54.

Cronin died on August 25, 2016, at the age of 84.

<text>Val Logsdon Fitch (March 10, 1923 – February 5, 2015) was an American nuclear physicist who, with co-researcher James Cronin, was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics for a 1964 experiment using the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory that proved that certain subatomic reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles. Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of K-mesons, that a reaction run in reverse does not retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the reactions of subatomic particles are not indifferent to time. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered. This demolished the faith that physicists had that natural laws were governed by symmetry.

Born on a cattle ranch near Merriman, Nebraska, Fitch was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II, and worked on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. He later graduated from McGill University, and completed his PhD in physics in 1954 at Columbia University. He was a member of the faculty at Princeton University from 1954 until his retirement in 2005.

==Early life==
Val Logsdon Fitch was born on a cattle ranch near Merriman, Nebraska, on March 10, 1923, the youngest of three children of Fred Fitch, a cattle rancher, and his wife Frances née Logsdon, a school teacher. He had an older brother and sister. The family farm was about in size. The ranch was small; his father specialized in raising breeding stock. Soon after his birth, his father was badly injured in a horse riding accident and could no longer work on his ranch, so the family moved to the nearby town of Gordon, Nebraska, where his father entered the insurance business. Here he attended school, graduating from Gordon High School in 1940 as valedictorian.

==Manhattan Project==
Fitch attended Chadron State College for three years, then transferred to Northwestern University. This was during WWII; his studies were interrupted by being drafted into the US Army in 1943. After completing basic training, he was sent to Carnegie Institute of Technology for training under the Army Specialized Training Program. Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program for less than a year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project.

The Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a third of the technicians at Los Alamos were from the SED. There he met many of the greats of physics including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segrè, Edward Teller and Richard C. Tolman, in some cases attending physics courses taught by them. He worked in the group headed by Ernest Titterton, a member of the British Mission, and became well-acquainted with the techniques of experimental physics. He participated in the drop testing of mock atomic bombs that was conducted at Wendover Army Air Field and the Naval Auxiliary Air Station Salton Sea, and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946. He continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year to earn money. He briefly returned to Los Alamos in summer 1948.

==Academic career==
His wartime experiences led Fitch to decide to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, the head of the physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi&#x27;s at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and there was no evidence that they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.

Fitch designed and built an experiment to measure the gamma rays emitted from mu-mesic atoms. As it turned out, this was a good time to search for them. Columbia had recently commissioned a cyclotron at the Nevis Laboratories that could produce muons; Robert Hofstadter had developed the thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector; and wartime advances in electronics yielded advances in components such as new phototubes needed to bring it all together. Initially nothing was found, but Rainwater suggested expanding the search beyond the energy range predicted by Wheeler on the basis of the then-accepted size of the radius of the atomic nucleus as around 1.4 × 10−15 m. When this was done, they found what they had been looking for, discovering in the process that the nucleus was closer to 1.2 × 10−15 m. He completed his PhD in 1954, writing his thesis on &quot;Studies of X-rays from mu-mesonic atoms&quot;. The thesis was published in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; in November 1953.

In 1949, Fitch married Elise Cunningham, a secretary who worked in the laboratory at Columbia. They had two sons. Elise died in 1972, and in 1976 he married Daisy Harper Sharp, thereby acquiring two stepdaughters and a stepson. After obtaining his doctorate, Fitch&#x27;s interest shifted to strange particles and K mesons. In 1954, he joined the physics faculty at Princeton University, where he spent the rest of his career. He was the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics from 1969 to 1976, the Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics from 1976 to 1982, and the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics from 1982 to 1993, when he retired and took up the position of visiting lecturer with the rank of professor for three years before entering emeritus status. He was chair of the physics department from 1976 to 1981.

Fitch conducted much of his research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he became acquainted with James Cronin. The two of them played bridge at nights while they waited for the Cosmotron to become available. Cronin had built a new kind of detector, a spark chamber spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with K mesons (now known as kaons), which Yale University physicist Robert Adair had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or antimatter. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and René Turlay, they set up their experiment on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect CP symmetry. K mesons that decayed into positrons did so faster than those that decayed into electrons. The importance of this result was not immediately appreciated; but as evidence of the Big Bang accumulated, Andrei Sakharov realized in 1967 that it explained why the universe is largely made of matter and not antimatter. Put simply, they had found &quot;the answer to the physicist&#x27;s &#x27;Why do we exist?&#x27;&quot; For this discovery, Fitch and Cronin received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Fitch received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1968, the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1976 and the National Medal of Science in 1993. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; and the JASON defense advisory group. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1964 and a Member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. In 1981, Fitch became a founding member of the World Cultural Council and received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was president of the American Physical Society from 1988 to 1989, and he served on a number of governmental science and science policy committees, including the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee from 1970 to 1973. 

Fitch is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

He died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 91 on February 5, 2015.

<doc id="396736" wikidata="Q2099455" url="?curid=396736" title="William Nassau de Zuylestein, 4th Earl of Rochford">
<text>William Henry Nassau de Zuylestein, 4th Earl of Rochford, KG, PC (17 September 1717 O.S. – 29 September 1781) was a British courtier, diplomat and statesman of Anglo-Dutch descent. He occupied senior ambassadorial posts at Madrid and Paris, and served as Secretary of State in both the Northern and Southern Departments. He is credited with the earliest-known introduction of the Lombardy poplar to England in 1754.

He was a personal friend of such major cultural figures as the actor David Garrick, the novelist Laurence Sterne, and the French playwright Beaumarchais. George III valued Rochford as his expert advisor on foreign affairs in the early 1770s, and as a loyal and hard-working cabinet minister. Rochford was the only British secretary of state between 1760 and 1778 who had been a career diplomat.

Rochford played key roles in the Manila Ransom negotiation with Spain (1763–66), the French acquisition of Corsica (1768), the Falkland Islands crisis of 1770–1, the crisis following the Swedish Revolution of 1772, and the aftermath of the Royal Marriages Act 1772. In addition to his work as foreign secretary, he carried a heavy burden of domestic responsibilities in the early 1770s, especially Irish affairs. He was a key member of the North administration in the early phase of the American War of Independence. Illness and a political scandal forced him from office in November 1775.

==Biography==

===Early life===
William Henry Nassau van Zuylestein was born in 1717, the elder son of Frederick Nassau van Zuylestein, 3rd Earl of Rochford, and his wife Elizabeth (&#x27;Bessy&#x27;) Savage, daughter of the 4th Earl Rivers. His ancestry was Anglo-Dutch, descended in an illegitimate line from William the Silent&#x27;s son Frederick Henry (1584–1647), Prince of Orange. Rochford&#x27;s grandfather and great-grandfather both had English wives, ladies-in-waiting at the courts of William II and William III of Orange. His grandfather was a close companion of William III, accompanying him to England in the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9, and later rewarded with the earldom of Rochford.

Educated at Eton College (1725–32) as Viscount Tunbridge, Rochford&#x27;s school friends included three future secretaries of state, Conway, Halifax and Sandwich. However, he also made a lifelong enemy at Eton of the Prime minister&#x27;s son, the influential writer Horace Walpole. Instead of going to university, Rochford was sent to the Academy at Geneva, where he lodged with the family of Professor Antoine Maurice. From Geneva he emerged as fluent in French as he was in Dutch and English, and succeeded his father as 4th Earl of Rochford in 1738 at the age of twenty-one.

===Courtier===
Rochford was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George II in 1739 (a mark of special royal favour) and served in this role until 1749. He inherited strong Whig principles and was a loyal supporter of the Hanoverian Protestant succession, but also admired Sir Robert Walpole&#x27;s peaceful foreign policy. At the time of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion he offered to raise a regiment, but this was not needed. He was active in Essex politics in the government&#x27;s interest, but he was no orator and made no impression in the House of Lords. He was appointed Vice-Admiral of Essex in 1748. Though ambitious for high political office, he avoided the factions and cultivated the King&#x27;s son, the Duke of Cumberland, as his patron. Cumberland successfully lobbied for Rochford to be given a diplomatic post at the end of the War of the Austrian Succession, and he was named Envoy to Turin in January 1749.

===Envoy at Turin===
Rochford arrived at Turin on 9 September 1749. This was still the most important of the Italian courts for British foreign policy at this time, and he started as Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, the highest rank in the British diplomatic service short of ambassador. However, he had agreed to accept an ordinary Envoy&#x27;s salary for a probationary period, and this gave him a strong incentive to show zeal and become a thoroughly professional diplomat. His first negotiations, on behalf of a company of English miners and the Protestant Vaudois communities of the Piedmont Alps, were entirely successful, and he then obtained his full salary. He ingratiated himself with the king, Carlo-Emmanuele III, by accompanying him on early morning hunting rides. Rochford made useful friends at court, and was highly regarded by the diplomatic corps at Turin. He played a minor but useful role in the complex negotiations for the Treaty of Aranjuez (1752). He made a tour of Italy in 1753 and used a spy to gain intelligence of the Young Pretender&#x27;s court at Rome. He also made full use of British consuls in the region to obtain information about trade matters and French involvement in Corsica, rewarding them with the removal of the duty on British shipping at Villafranca.

===Lord Lieutenant of Essex===

Recalled from Turin for the duration of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1755–63), Rochford resumed his career as a courtier, appointed by George II as First Lord of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Stole, highly prestigious posts. He was also appointed a member of the Privy Council in 1755. As Lord Lieutenant of Essex from May 1756, Rochford was closely involved in forming the Essex regiment of militia, becoming its Colonel in November 1759. At the death of George II in 1760 Rochford lost his lucrative court posts, but was compensated with a generous pension. He spent the early 1760s involved in local Essex politics and &#x27;improved&#x27; the Park at his St Osyth estate, adding a formal Dutch garden and a maze. However, his landed income was small for an earl, and a return to diplomacy became a financial necessity. He was named Ambassador to Spain on 18 June 1763.

===Ambassador to Spain===
Rochford&#x27;s secret instructions for his Madrid embassy were mainly concerned with countering French influence over the king, Carlos III, and reporting on Spain&#x27;s naval reconstruction after her late and disastrous entry into the Seven Years&#x27; War. His first major negotiation resulted from Spain&#x27;s expulsion of British logwood cutters from the Yucatán Peninsula in Honduras. With strong support from Grenville&#x27;s administration, Rochford&#x27;s threats of naval force made the Spanish back down, but gave him a reputation as an anti-Bourbon. Less successful were his efforts to compel Spain to pay the disputed Manila Ransom, which the French foreign minister Choiseul suggested should be submitted to arbitration. Rochford&#x27;s alertness uncovered a French plot to set fire to British naval dockyards, a scheme which was postponed until 1770. His friendship with the British consul-general at Madrid, Stanier Porten (uncle of the historian Edward Gibbon) deepened his interest in trade matters, and he used the consuls as well as paid spies to get accurate information about Spain&#x27;s naval rebuilding. While at Madrid he befriended the young French playwright Beaumarchais, whose experiences in Spain later formed the basis of his play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. Near the close of his embassy, Rochford was an eyewitness to the Madrid Riots of 1766.

===Ambassador to France===
Rochford&#x27;s appointment to Paris was unexpected, and he left Madrid in such haste that he had to pawn his plate to settle his debts. He insisted on taking the exceptionally capable Porten to Paris as his secretary of embassy. Choiseul at once embroiled Rochford in a scheme to trade off Britain&#x27;s claim to the Manila Ransom for relinquishment of the Falkland Islands, but the misreporting of a previous ambassador, Lord Hertford, and the inexperience of the secretary of state, Lord Shelburne, wrecked this transaction. Choiseul was furious, and unfairly blamed Rochford. Rochford was almost the only member of the diplomatic corps at Paris brave enough to stand up to Choiseul&#x27;s bullying, and their negotiations over such matters as Dunkirk, the Canada Bills and the East India Company&#x27;s claim for compensation for wartime expenses in India were often acrimonious. Rochford prepared thoroughly and mastered the details, winning grudging concessions from Choiseul on all three issues.

Choiseul&#x27;s greatest coup (and Rochford&#x27;s greatest failure) concerned France&#x27;s secret acquisition of Corsica from the Republic of Genoa in 1768. Though Rochford gave early warning of the likely terms, and paid a spy to get a copy of the draft treaty, the British cabinet led by Lord Grafton was too preoccupied by rioting in London and failed to support their ambassador in Paris. Rochford also had the misfortune to fall seriously ill for a fortnight at the height of the crisis, enabling Choiseul to clinch the deal with Genoa. Britain&#x27;s protests thereafter were ineffectual, and an angry Rochford returned to London to resign his embassy. Instead, he was offered a cabinet seat, which he finally accepted on 21 October 1768, on condition that Porten became his under-secretary.

===Northern Secretary===
Contemporary observers such as Edmund Burke and the anonymous letter-writer &#x27;Junius&#x27; thought it odd that Rochford was appointed northern secretary when all of his diplomatic experience had been in southern courts, but Lord Weymouth had insisted on taking the Southern Department as the more important of the secretaryships. British foreign policy, and Britain&#x27;s reputation in Europe, had sunk to their lowest ebb of the eighteenth century thanks to the 1768 Corsican fiasco, but Rochford&#x27;s realistic and capable handling of his new portfolio strengthened British foreign policy in several ways. British diplomats abroad were relieved to be dealing with a secretary of state who knew the business of diplomacy, and regularly kept them informed. Hamish Scott has suggested that Rochford &#x27;almost single-handed&#x27; averted the impending shipwreck for Britain&#x27;s reputation in Europe.

Britain&#x27;s main goal at this time was a treaty of alliance with Russia, but the Empress Catherine II and her foreign minister Panin insisted on a hefty subsidy, which Rochford refused. Instead he persuaded George III to pour secret service money into Swedish politics, to support Russia and undermine French influence. Britain&#x27;s envoy at Stockholm, Sir John Goodricke, made adroit use of this money, and helped to maintain Sweden&#x27;s liberal constitution. According to Michael Roberts, Rochford was much more practical and realistic than Choiseul in his handling of Swedish affairs.

===Falklands Crisis===
Spain&#x27;s expulsion of a British garrison from the Falkland Islands in May 1770 sparked a major diplomatic crisis that brought Europe to the brink of war. Historians have hitherto attributed the resolution of this crisis to a &#x27;secret promise&#x27; by the British Prime Minister Lord North that Britain would quietly evacuate the islands at some future date if the Spanish agreed to disavow their officers and restore the fort to Britain. Recent research in the foreign diplomatic archives suggests an entirely different view of the British side of this crisis. Far from resolving the crisis, North&#x27;s &#x27;secret promise&#x27; nearly wrecked an agreed policy of firm response backed by the threat of naval force. This was Rochford&#x27;s policy, backed by George III. Though he was Northern Secretary in 1770, Rochford&#x27;s advice to cabinet as a former ambassador to Madrid and Paris was decisive. Weymouth&#x27;s laziness and frequent absences left his Southern portfolio for Rochford to manage as well as his own. It was Rochford who ordered the Admiralty to prepare a fleet for war, and sent a simple demand for disavowal and restitution to Madrid. Spain&#x27;s response crucially depended on French support in the event of war, and France began to prepare a fleet, but the French king&#x27;s dismissal of Choiseul in December 1770 removed that prospect, and the recall of the British envoy Harris from Madrid showed that Britain was still prepared to go to war. Weymouth also resigned in December 1770, and Rochford replaced him as southern secretary on 19 December 1770.

===Southern Secretary===
Rochford had already taken charge of the Falklands negotiation, and now received the Spanish acceptance of his demands. The disarmament talks over the next few months were often stormy, however, and there was still a risk of war until April 1771, when all sides disarmed simultaneously, as Rochford had proposed. After Sandwich was named as First Lord of the Admiralty, Rochford&#x27;s successor as northern secretary was Lord Suffolk, who spent a year improving his French so that he could converse with the foreign diplomats in London. In the meantime, Rochford was de facto foreign minister, handling all of Britain&#x27;s diplomatic correspondence until 1772. Before the creation of separate Home and Foreign offices in 1782, the Southern Secretary carried a heavy burden of domestic responsibilities, including oversight of Ireland. The Irish correspondence almost equalled the rest of Rochford&#x27;s domestic correspondence across 1771–5.

Rochford&#x27;s first successes as Southern Secretary were to persuade the new French foreign minister the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon to settle the long-standing Canada Bills dispute, and to forestall a French attempt to reinforce their depleted possessions in India. After George III&#x27;s clumsy intervention in Denmark in 1772 to support his disgraced sister, Queen Caroline, Rochford&#x27;s first big challenge as southern secretary was the Swedish crisis of 1772–3, following the constitutional coup by Gustavus III in August 1772. This crisis again brought Europe to the brink of war, as Russia threatened to invade Sweden and France threatened to send a fleet to the Baltic to support Gustavus. Rochford played a key role in this crisis, advising caution to the Russians and warning the French that Britain would also send a fleet to the Baltic. Panin finally decided not to invade, and the crisis eased as the French switched their naval armament from Brest to Toulon.

The First Partition of Poland in 1772 had, as Rochford noted, &#x27;changed absolutely the System of Europe&#x27;, demonstrating the emergence of Russia and Prussia as predatory new powers. With encouragement from George III, Rochford had embarked on a risky new policy of secret friendship with France, with the long-term goal of forming a defensive alliance of the maritime colonial powers as a counterbalance to the &#x27;eastern powers&#x27;. The Swedish crisis wrecked this initiative, and Rochford then turned to cultivate friendship with Spain, in an attempt to &#x27;drive a wedge&#x27; into the Family Compact. Relations with both Bourbon powers were more cordial by 1775 than they had been since 1763, but France&#x27;s clandestine support for the American colonies increasingly negated one leg of this policy.

Rochford&#x27;s most difficult domestic duty as southern secretary was to act on behalf of George III in the painful negotiations of May 1773 with his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, who had secretly married Horace Walpole&#x27;s niece, Maria Waldegrave, in 1766. She was now pregnant, and Gloucester wanted an assurance of financial support for his family. In view of the Royal Marriages Act of 1772, George III regarded this news as a betrayal by his most trusted sibling, and was deeply hurt, refusing at first to make any reply. Rochford was the only cabinet member willing to act as intermediary. Horace Walpole&#x27;s dislike for Rochford now turned to bitter hatred. He vilified Rochford because he could not openly vilify the king.

===Retirement===

Poor health and the bungled arrest of an American banker in London, Stephen Sayre, on suspicion of a plot to kidnap George III, prompted Rochford&#x27;s retirement on 11 November 1775, with a generous pension and a promise of the &#x27;Blue Ribband&#x27; (Knight of the Garter). He was twice offered the lucrative viceroyalty of Ireland in 1776, and would have been an ideal candidate, but he declined on health grounds. On 12 June 1776 Rochford was elected Master of Trinity House, the corporation responsible for lighthouses, pilots and mariners&#x27; welfare. On behalf of George III he also undertook secret talks with Beaumarchais, and made a quick trip incognito to Paris to try to persuade the French government to stop sending aid to the American rebels, concluding that France was about to declare open war. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1779. His last years were devoted to the Essex Militia, even after the threat of a French invasion had passed. He died at St Osyth on 29 September 1781. He was succeeded by his bachelor nephew, at whose death in 1830 the Rochford title became extinct.

==Personal life==

In May 1742 Rochford married Lucy Younge, daughter of Edward Younge of Durnford in Wiltshire, but the marriage produced no children. Rochford and Lucy first lived at Easton in Suffolk, a property inherited from his uncle Henry Nassau, and they only moved to the family seat at St Osyth in Essex after the death of Rochford&#x27;s mother in 1746. Rochford also bought a town house in London, at 48 Berkeley Square, which he owned until 1777. The Rochfords allowed each considerable freedom in their personal lives, even by the rather relaxed standards of the eighteenth century nobility, and Lucy Rochford was notorious for her numerous lovers, who included the Duke of Cumberland and the Prince of Hesse. Rochford had mistresses at Turin, one of whom, an opera-dancer named Signora Banti, followed him to London, but he never acknowledged her children as his own. Lucy objected to this expensive mistress, and Rochford agreed to give her up if Lucy also gave up her current lover, Lord Thanet. She responded that he was not a drain on their finances, but quite the contrary.

Rochford&#x27;s next mistress, Martha Harrison, gave him a daughter, Maria Nassau, who was adopted by Lucy as her surrogate daughter. Maria lived with them in Paris, and thereafter at St Osyth. Rochford had affairs in Paris with the wives of two of Choiseul&#x27;s friends, the marquise de Laborde and Mme Latournelle. Another mistress, Ann Labbee Johnson, followed him to London and bore him a son and daughter. After Lucy&#x27;s death in 1773 Rochford brought Ann and the children to live with him at St Osyth. His will made her sole executrix of his estate and paid tribute to her &#x27;friendship and affection&#x27;.

In his youth Rochford was an accomplished horseman and an expert yachtsman, once racing his yacht from Harwich to London against that of Richard Rigby, and was also involved in early Essex cricket matches. He used his yacht to visit his estates at Zuylestein in Holland&#x27;s Utrecht province. He was an enthusiast for English country dancing, fostering their popularity at the court of Turin in the 1750s. His greatest loves (apart from his various mistresses) were the theatre, music and opera. (He played the baroque guitar.) Confessing himself &#x27;excessively curious for plants&#x27;, he collected specimens on a visit to the Swiss Alps in 1751 to send home to St Osyth. Most famously, he is credited with the first known introduction of the Lombardy poplar to southern England, bringing home a sapling strapped to the centre-pole of his carriage in 1754.

==Legacy and significance==

With no spectacular triumphs or major treaties to his name, and with his most important secret negotiations unknown at the time, Rochford was soon forgotten after his death. His reputation also suffered at the hands of Horace Walpole, who never missed a chance to belittle Rochford. In his &quot;Memoirs of the Reign of King George III&quot;, Walpole described Rochford as &#x27;a man of no abilities and of as little knowledge, except in the routine of office&#x27;. Yet elsewhere Walpole had recognised Rochford&#x27;s honesty and flexibility. The disappearance of Rochford&#x27;s personal papers (until those relating to his Turin appointment were rediscovered in 1971) meant that historians had very little with which to reconstruct his personal life, but many of his letters have survived in their recipients&#x27; collections, especially those of Garrick and Denbigh.

Detailed research in British and foreign diplomatic archives has enabled a more accurate assessment of the 4th Earl of Rochford&#x27;s public career. As a diplomat he was thoroughly professional, in an age of titled amateurs. He was businesslike and methodical, mastering the detail of complex negotiations, and was widely respected as a tough negotiator and an honest broker. His diplomatic experience proved invaluable when he became secretary of state, and it is clear from the foreign archives how well he managed British foreign policy up to the outbreak of the American War of Independence. He was exceptionally well-informed, and his unpublished Plan to Prevent War in Europe (1775) reveals him as a strategic thinker, and one of the most imaginative of Britain&#x27;s eighteenth century secretaries of state.

George III once remarked on Rochford&#x27;s &#x27;many amiable qualities&#x27;, adding that his &#x27;Zeal makes him rather in a hurry&#x27;. The king also told Stanier Porten that Rochford was &#x27;more active and had more spirit&#x27; than anyone else in the North cabinet of the early 1770s. Hamish Scott has described Rochford as &#x27;the ablest man to control foreign policy in the first decade of peace [after 1763], a statesman of intelligence, perception and considerable application&#x27;.

Rochford&#x27;s major diplomatic legacy was his policy of trying to detach Spain from the Family Compact with France. In his last year in office Rochford had reassured the Spanish ministers that Britain wanted them to remain neutral and would not strike first. He also warned the Spanish that their colonies in Central and South America might be tempted to follow the example of the rebellious North American colonies. These considerations meant that Spain did not automatically join France in open war at sea in 1778, but delayed for another year. That British commanders in America squandered the time thus gained was not Rochford&#x27;s fault. Historians now agree that the American rebels won the war mainly because Britain&#x27;s naval resources were too thinly stretched by the involvement of the Bourbon powers.

<doc id="396737" wikidata="Q189987" url="?curid=396737" title="Nicolaas Bloembergen">
<text>Nicolaas Bloembergen (March 11, 1920 – September 5, 2017) was a Dutch-American physicist and Nobel laureate, recognized for his work in developing driving principles behind nonlinear optics for laser spectroscopy. During his career, he was a professor at Harvard University and later at the University of Arizona and at Leiden University in 1973 (as Lorentz Professor).

Bloembergen shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Arthur Schawlow and Kai Siegbahn because their work &quot;has had a profound effect on our present knowledge of the constitution of matter&quot; through the use of laser spectroscopy. In particular, Bloembergen was singled out because he &quot;founded a new field of science we now call non-linear optics&quot; by mixing &quot;two or more beams of laser light... in order to produce laser light of a different wave length&quot; and thus significantly broaden the laser spectroscopy frequency band.

==Early life==
Bloembergen was born in Dordrecht on March 11, 1920, where his father was a chemical engineer and executive. He had five siblings, with his brother Auke later becoming a legal scholar. In 1938, Bloembergen entered the University of Utrecht to study physics. However, during World War II, the German authorities closed the university and Bloembergen spent two years in hiding.

==Career==
===Graduate studies===

Bloembergen left the war-ravaged Netherlands in 1945 to pursue graduate studies at Harvard University under Professor Edward Mills Purcell. Through Purcell, Bloembergen was part of the prolific academic lineage tree of J. J. Thomson, which includes many other Nobel Laureates, beginning with Thomson himself (Physics Nobel, 1906) and Lord Rayleigh (Physics Nobel, 1904), Ernest Rutherford (Chemistry Nobel 1908), Owen Richardson (Physics Nobel, 1928), and finally Purcell (Physics, Nobel 1952). Bloembergen&#x27;s other influences include John Van Vleck (Physics Nobel, 1977) and Percy Bridgman (Physics Nobel, 1946).

Six weeks before his arrival, Purcell and his graduate students Torrey and Pound discovered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Bloembergen was hired to develop the first NMR machine. At Harvard he attended lectures by Schwinger, Van Vleck, and Kemble. Bloembergen&#x27;s NMR systems are the predecessors of modern-day MRI machines, which are used to examine internal organs and tissues. Bloembergen&#x27;s research on NMR led to an interest in masers, which were introduced in 1953 and are the predecessors of lasers.

Bloembergen returned to the Netherlands in 1947, and submitted his thesis &quot;Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation&quot; at the University of Leiden. This was because he had completed all the preliminary examinations in the Netherlands, and Cor Gorter of Leiden offered him a postdoctoral appointment there. He received his Ph.D. degree from Leiden in 1948, and then was a postdoc at Leiden for about a year.

===Professorship===
In 1949, he returned to Harvard as a junior fellow of the Society of Fellows. In 1951, he became an associate professor; he then became Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics in 1957; Rumford Professor of Physics in 1974; and Gerhard Gade University Professor in 1980. In 1990 he retired from Harvard.

In addition, Bloembergen served as a visiting professor. From 1964 to 1965, Bloembergen was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1996–1997, he was a visiting scientist at the college of optical sciences of the University of Arizona; he became a professor at Arizona in 2001.

Bloembergen was a member of the board of sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; and honorary editor of the &quot;Journal of Nonlinear Optical Physics &amp; Materials&quot;.

===Laser spectroscopy===

By 1960 while at Harvard, he experimented with microwave spectroscopy. Bloembergen had modified the maser of Charles Townes, and in 1956, Bloembergen developed a crystal maser, which was more powerful than the standard gaseous version.

With the advent of the laser, he participated in the development of the field of laser spectroscopy, which allows precise observations of atomic structure using lasers. Following the development of second-harmonic generation by Peter Franken and others in 1961, Bloembergen studied how a new structure of matter is revealed, when one bombards matter with a focused and high-intensity beam of photons. This he termed the study of nonlinear optics. In reflection to his work in a Dutch newspaper in 1990, Bloembergen said: &quot;We took a standard textbook on optics and for each section we asked ourselves what would happen if the intensity was to become very high. We were almost certain that we were bound to encounter an entirely new type of physics within that domain&quot;.

From this theoretical work, Bloembergen found ways to combine two or more laser sources consisting of photons in the visible light frequency range to generate a single laser source with photons of different frequencies in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, which extends the amount of atomic detail that can be gathered from laser spectroscopy.

==Personal life and death==
Bloembergen met Huberta Deliana Brink (Deli) in 1948 while on vacation with his university&#x27;s Physics Club. She was able to travel with him to the United States in 1949 on a student hospitality exchange program; he proposed to her when they arrived in the States, and were married by 1950 on return to Amsterdam. They were both naturalized as citizens of the United States in 1958. They had three children.

Bloembergen died on September 5, 2017, at an assisted living facility in his hometown Tucson, Arizona, of cardiorespiratory failure, at the age of 97.

== Biography ==
In 2016 a Dutch biography was published, and in 2019 an English one.

== Awards and Honors ==

Bloembergen shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Arthur Schawlow, along with Kai Siegbahn. The Nobel Foundation awarded Bloembergen and Schawlow &quot;for their contribution to the development of laser spectroscopy&quot;.

<text>Arthur Leonard Schawlow (May 5, 1921 – April 28, 1999) was an American physicist who, along with Charles Townes, developed the theoretical basis for laser science. His central insight was the use of two mirrors as the resonant cavity to take maser action from microwaves to visible wavelengths. He shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work using lasers to determine atomic energy levels with great precision.

==Biography==
Schawlow was born in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Helen (Mason), was from Canada, and his father, Arthur Schawlow, was a Jewish immigrant from Riga (then in the Russian Empire, now in Latvia). Schawlow was raised in his mother&#x27;s Protestant religion. When Arthur was three years old, they moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

At the age of 16, he completed high school at Vaughan Road Academy (then Vaughan Collegiate Institute), and received a scholarship in science at the University of Toronto (Victoria College). After earning his undergraduate degree, Schawlow continued in graduate school at the University of Toronto which was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, he began work on his Ph.D at the university with Professor Malcolm Crawford. He then took a postdoctoral position with Charles H. Townes at the physics department of Columbia University in the fall of 1949.

He went on to accept a position at Bell Labs in late 1951. He left in 1961 to join the faculty at Stanford University as a professor. He remained at Stanford until he retired to emeritus status in 1996.

Although his research focused on optics, in particular, lasers and their use in spectroscopy, he also pursued investigations in the areas of superconductivity and nuclear resonance. Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for their contributions to the development of laser spectroscopy.

Schawlow coauthored the widely used text &quot;Microwave Spectroscopy&quot; (1955) with Charles Townes. Schawlow and Townes were the first to publish the theory of laser design and operation in their seminal 1958 paper on &quot;optical masers&quot;, although Gordon Gould is often credited with the &quot;invention&quot; of the laser, due to his unpublished work that predated Schawlow and Townes by a few months. The first working laser was made in 1960 by Theodore Maiman.

In 1991, the NEC Corporation and the American Physical Society established a prize: the Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science. The prize is awarded annually to &quot;candidates who have made outstanding contributions to basic research using lasers.&quot;

==Science and religion==
He participated in science and religion discussions. Regarding God, he stated, &quot;I find a need for God in the universe and in my own life.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1951, he married Aurelia Townes, younger sister of his postdoctoral advisor, Charles Townes. They had three children: Arthur Jr., Helen, and Edith. Arthur Jr. is autistic, with very little speech ability.

Schawlow and Professor Robert Hofstadter at Stanford, who also had an autistic child, teamed up to help each other find solutions to the condition. Arthur Jr. was put in a special center for autistic individuals, and later, Schawlow put together an institution to care for people with autism in Paradise, California. It was later named the Arthur Schawlow Center in 1999, shortly before his death. Schawlow was a promoter of the controversial method of facilitated communication with patients of autism.

He considered himself to be an orthodox Protestant Christian, and attended a Methodist church.
Arthur Schawlow was an intense fan and collector of traditional American jazz recordings, as well as a supporter of instrumental groups performing this type of music.

Schawlow died of leukemia in Palo Alto, California, on April 28, 1999, at the age 77.

<text>Kai Manne Börje Siegbahn (20 April 1918 – 20 July 2007) was a Swedish physicist who shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==Biography==
Siegbahn was born in Lund, Sweden, son of Manne Siegbahn the 1924 physics Nobel Prize winner. Siegbahn earned his doctorate at the University of Stockholm in 1944. He was professor at the Royal Institute of Technology 1951–1954, and then professor of experimental physics at Uppsala University 1954–1984, which was the same chair his father had held. He shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Arthur Schawlow. Siegbahn received half the prize &quot;for his contribution to the development of high-resolution electron spectroscopy&quot; while Bloembergen and Schawlow received one quarter each &quot;for their contribution to the development of laser spectroscopy&quot;.

Siegbahn referred to his technique as Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA); it is now usually known as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In 1967 he published a book, &quot;ESCA; atomic, molecular and solid state structure studied by means of electron spectroscopy&quot;. 

He was a member of several academies and societies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and was president of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics from 1981 to 1984.

Siegbahn married Anna Brita Rhedin in 1944. The couple had three sons (two physicists and a biochemist).

Siegbahn died on 20 July 2007 at the age of 89. At the time of his death he was still active as a scientist at the Ångström Laboratory at Uppsala University.

==Awards==
As well as a share of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics, Siegbahn won the following awards:
* 1945 Lindblom Prize
* 1955, 1977 Björkén Prize
* 1962 Celsius Medal
* 1971 Sixten Heyman Award, University of Gothenburg
* 1973 Harrison Howe Award, Rochester 
* 1975 Maurice F. Hasler Award, Cleveland

<doc id="396743" wikidata="Q193503" url="?curid=396743" title="Kenneth G. Wilson">
<text>Kenneth Geddes &quot;Ken&quot; Wilson (June 8, 1936 – June 15, 2013) was an American theoretical physicist and a pioneer in using computers for studying particle physics. He was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on phase transitions—illuminating the subtle essence of phenomena like melting ice and emerging magnetism. It was embodied in his fundamental work on the renormalization group.

==Life==
Wilson was born on June 8, 1936, in Waltham, Massachusetts, the oldest child of Emily Buckingham Wilson and E. Bright Wilson, a prominent chemist at Harvard University, who did
important work on microwave emissions. His mother also trained as a physicist. He attended several schools, including Magdalen College School, Oxford, England,
ending up at the George School in eastern Pennsylvania.

He went on to Harvard College at age 16, majoring in Mathematics and, on two occasions, in 1954 and 1956, ranked among the top five in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition.
He was also a star on the athletics track, representing Harvard in the Mile. During his summer holidays he worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann. He did post-doc work at Harvard and CERN.

He joined Cornell University in 1963 in the Department of Physics as a junior faculty member, becoming a full professor in 1970. He also did research at SLAC during this period. In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell.

In 1982 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on critical phenomena using the renormalization group.

He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff.
His other awards include the A.C. Eringen Medal, the Franklin Medal, the Boltzmann Medal, and the Dannie Heinemann Prize. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Science and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science, both in 1975, and also was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1984.

In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell&#x27;s Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (now known as the Cornell Theory Center), one of five national supercomputer centers created by the National Science Foundation. In 1988, Wilson joined the faculty at Ohio State University. Wilson moved to Gray, Maine in 1995. He continued his association with Ohio State University until he retired in 2008. Prior to his death, he was actively involved in research on physics education and was an early proponent of &quot;active involvement&quot; (i.e. Science by Inquiry) of K-12 students in science and math.

Some of his PhD students include H. R. Krishnamurthy, Roman Jackiw, Michael Peskin, Serge Rudaz, Paul Ginsparg, and Steven R. White.

Wilson&#x27;s brother David was also a professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics until his death, and his wife since 1982, Alison Brown, is a prominent computer scientist.

He died in Saco, Maine, on June 15, 2013, at the age of 77. He was respectfully remembered by his colleagues.

==Work==
Wilson&#x27;s work in physics involved formulation of a comprehensive theory of scaling: how fundamental properties and forces of a system vary depending on the scale over which they are measured. He devised a universal &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; strategy for calculating how phase transitions occur, by considering each scale separately and then abstracting the connection between contiguous ones, in a novel appreciation of renormalization group theory. This provided profound insights into the field of critical phenomena and phase transitions in statistical physics enabling precise calculations. One example of an important problem in solid-state physics he solved using renormalization is in quantitatively describing the Kondo effect.

He extended these insights on scaling to answer fundamental questions on the nature of quantum field theory and the operator product expansion and the physical meaning of the renormalization group.

He also pioneered the understanding of the confinement of quarks inside hadrons, utilizing lattice gauge theory,
and initiating an approach permitting formerly foreboding strong-coupling calculations on computers. On such a lattice, he further shed light on chiral symmetry, a crucial feature of elementary particle interactions.

<doc id="396748" wikidata="Q4020235" url="?curid=396748" title="Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire">
<text>Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire, (30 May 1718 – 7 October 1793), known as the 2nd Viscount Hillsborough from 1742 to 1751 and as the 1st Earl of Hillsborough from 1751 to 1789, was a British politician of the Georgian era.

Best known in North America as the Earl of Hillsborough, he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1768 to 1772, a critical period leading toward the American War of Independence.

==Background==
Born in Fairford, Gloucestershire, Wills Hill was the son of Trevor Hill, 1st Viscount Hillsborough, and Mary, daughter of Anthony Rowe. He was named after General Sir Charles Wills, his godfather.

==Political career==
Hill, known retrospectively as Downshire, was returned to Parliament for Warwick in 1741, a seat he held until 1756. He succeeded his father as The 2nd Viscount Hillsborough in May 1742 (as this was an Irish peerage he was able to continue to sit in the British House of Commons). Lord Hillsborough, as he now was, was the same year appointed Lord Lieutenant of County Down and Custos Rotulorum of County Down.

In 1751, he was created Earl of Hillsborough in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1754, he was made Comptroller of the Household, a post he held until 1756, and appointed a Privy Counsellor. In 1756, he was created Baron Harwich, of Harwich in the County of Essex, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords.

For nearly two years, between 1763 and 1765, Lord Hillsborough was President of the Board of Trade and Plantations under George Grenville, and after a brief period of retirement he filled the same position in 1766, and then that of joint Postmaster General, under the Earl of Chatham. From 1768 to 1772, Hillsborough was Secretary of State for the Colonies and also President of the Board of Trade. Both in and out of office, Hillsborough opposed all concessions to the American colonists, but he favoured the project for a union between England and the Kingdom of Ireland. On his retirement in 1772, he was created Earl of Hillsborough in the Peerage of Great Britain.

In 1779 he served as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, remaining until 1782. He was the last person to serve in this position, because the Secretaries of State were reorganized.

In 1789, he was made Marquess of Downshire in the Irish peerage.

==Family and legacy==

Lord Downshire married firstly Lady Margaretta, daughter of The 19th Earl of Kildare, in 1747. His second daughter and last child by his first marriage was Lady Charlotte Hill, wife of The 1st Earl Talbot. Lady Talbot was the subject of a notable portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. 

After her death in 1766, he married secondly Mary Bilson-Legge, 1st Baroness Stawell, daughter of Edward, 4th Baron Stawell, and widow of Henry Bilson-Legge, in 1768. She died in 1780. 

Lord Downshire died on 7 October 1793, aged 75, and was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, Arthur. 

In the United States, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, the town of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, within the county, the town of Hillsborough, North Carolina, and Hillsborough County, Florida, Hillsboro, Highland, Ohio were named after the Marquess. Hillsborough, California, named for Hillsborough, New Hampshire, is an indirect namesake.

In Canada, Hillsborough Bay, on Prince Edward Island, and the village of Hillsborough, New Brunswick, were named in Downshire&#x27;s honour.

<text>:&quot;TCID may also stand for &quot;Tissue Culture Infectious Dose.&quot; or &quot;4,5,6,7-Tetrachloro-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione&quot;&quot;

The Truckee–Carson Irrigation District (TCID) is a public enterprise organized in the State of Nevada, which operates dams at Lake Tahoe, diversion dams on the Truckee River in Washoe County, and the Lake Lahontan reservoir. 

TCD also operates of canals, and of drains, in support of agriculture in Lyon County and Churchill County, western Nevada. The excess irrigation water eventually drains into the endorheic Lake Lahontan Basin.

==Endangered species==
Diversion of water by the TCID from the Truckee River has caused a reduction in the level of natural Pyramid Lake, resulting in the endemic species of fish that live in it becoming endangered species. 

In the mid-1980s the United States Environmental Protection Agency initiated development of the DSSAM Model to analyze effects of variable Truckee River flow rates and water quality upon these endangered fish species.

<text>John Hampden-Trevor, 3rd Viscount Hampden PC (24 February 1748 – 9 September 1824), was a British diplomat.

==Biography==
He was the younger son of Robert Hampden, 1st Viscount Hampden and was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He followed in his father&#x27;s career by becoming a diplomat. He was Minister to Munich (1780 – 1783) and to Turin (1783 – 1798).

On 8 May 1773, he married Harriet Burton (1751–1829), daughter of the Rev. Daniel Burton. Trevor was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797. He succeeded to the Viscountcy of Hampden on 20 August 1824, just three weeks before his death. He had no heirs, and the title became extinct at that time.

<doc id="396757" wikidata="Q637555" url="?curid=396757" title="Montego Bay">
<text>Montego Bay is the capital of the parish of St. James in Jamaica. The city is the fourth most populous urban area in the country, after Kingston, Spanish Town, and Portmore, all of which form the Greater Kingston Metropolitan Area, home to over half a million people. As a result, Montego Bay is the second-largest anglophone city in the Caribbean, after Kingston.

Montego Bay is a popular tourist destination featuring duty-free shopping, a cruise line terminal and several beaches and resorts. The city is served by the Donald Sangster International Airport, the busiest airport in the Anglophone Caribbean, which is located within the official city limits. The city is enclosed in a watershed, drained by several rivers such as the Montego River. Montego Bay is referred to as &quot;The Second City&quot;, &quot;MoBay&quot; or &quot;Bay&quot;.

==Toponymy==
Christopher Columbus named the bay of Montego, &quot;Golfo de Buen Tiempo&quot; (&quot;Fair Weather Gulf&quot;). The name &quot;Montego Bay&quot; is believed to have originated as a corruption of the Spanish word &quot;manteca&quot; (&quot;lard&quot;), allegedly because during the Spanish period it was the port where lard, leather and beef were exported.

==History==


The Arawak tribe of South America are Jamaica&#x27;s first known inhabitants and were there to greet Columbus when he ventured to the island in 1494. Jamaica was a colony of Spain from 1511 until 1655, when Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Caribbean expedition, the Western Design, drove the Spanish from the island. After the British removed the Spanish rule, along with the majority of all buildings and infrastructure, the colonials established the parish of St. James which directly influenced the area in becoming a huge contributor of sugar cane. In fact, during this period of British governing, Montego Bay was the largest producer of sugar cane on the island of Jamaica, giving the region more value than originally anticipated.

Throughout the duration of slavery, from the mid-17th century until 1834, and well into the 20th century, the town of Montego Bay functioned primarily as a sugarcane port. The island&#x27;s last major slave revolt, the Christmas Rebellion or Baptist War (1831–1832) took place in and around the area of Montego Bay. The rebellion set estates and plantations to flame and was the start of a broader political push toward emancipation. Retribution was quickly sought by British leaders and many were hanged for their attempts at revolt; the leader of the revolt, Samuel Sharpe, was hanged there in 1832. Recognition was later given, and Sharpe was proclaimed a national hero of Jamaica in 1975, and the main square of the town was renamed in his honor. Eventually, Jamaica was emancipated on August 1, 1834 which granted all new children born or children under the age of six &quot;free&quot; status, but held individuals outside of that parameter to be apprentices and work forty hours a week in compensation to their previous or original owners. It was not until four years after these restrictions were put in place that all slave and apprentices were given the status of full freedom. After the half decade emancipation process, Montego Bay and its sugarcane industry took a hit. Therefore, it branched out and took root in expanding into exporting bananas and coffee as well.

Montego Bay&#x27;s city status prior to British rule was debated; however, it had its city status revoked during Jamaica&#x27;s British colonial period. It was re-proclaimed a city by act of parliament in 1980, but this has not meant that it has acquired any form of autonomy, for it continues to be an integral part of the parish of St. James.

Today, Montego Bay is known for Cornwall Regional Hospital, port facilities, second homes for numerous upper-class Jamaicans from Kingston as well as North Americans and Europeans, fine restaurants, vibrant night life and shopping. The coastland near Montego Bay is occupied by numerous tourist resorts, most newly built, some occupying the grounds of old sugarcane plantations with some of the original buildings and mill-works still standing. The most famous is the White Witch&#x27;s Rose Hall which features a world-class golf course.

The infrastructure of the city is going through a series of modernizations which once completed, aims to keep Montego Bay as a top destination in the region. The Montego Bay Convention Centre, built on a large site near to the Rose Hall estate, was opened by Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding on 7 January 2011.

==Demographics==
The majority of the city&#x27;s population is of African descent. The city is also home to sizeable minority ethnic groups such as the East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the mid-to-late 19th century. The Chinese especially occupy important roles in the city&#x27;s economy especially in retail where Downtown Montego Bay is home to many shops and supermarkets owned by Chinese immigrants. The city&#x27;s East Indian population also play a key role as they operate many gift and jewelry shops in the city which are mostly geared to tourists.

There is a minority of Europeans, some descending from immigrants from Germany (the city is a 90-minute drive from German settlements such as German Town in Westmoreland) and Great Britain (who own most of the land in the city from as far back as the days of the slave trade).

The city is home to many immigrants from Hispanic countries such as Mexico, Cuba and Spain as well as many French, Russians and Italians (who mostly own homes or beachfront properties in the area).

The city also is home to many Americans and Canadians, who work the tourism or business process outsourcing (BPO) industries.

==Religion==
There are a wide variety of Christian churches in the city. Most are Protestant, a legacy of British colonisation of the island. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal. Afro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following. The city also has a unit of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The city also has communities of Buddhists, Hindus, and Muslims.

==Economy==
Montego Bay is pivotal to Jamaica&#x27;s economy. The city holds most of the weight of the country&#x27;s tourism sector. Most of the country&#x27;s visitors arrive and depart from Montego Bay&#x27;s airport or port. Many international companies have resorts in the city including Hyatt, Hilton Hotels, Holiday Inn, RIU Hotels, Royalton and Iberostar. The city is the home to the headquarters of international resort chain Sandals. The Government of Jamaica, through the Ministry of Tourism, has begun to focus on bolstering the city&#x27;s entertainment and gastronomic offerings. Though the city&#x27;s airport hosts a number international chains, the city itself does not have access to these restaurants. The city has become home to Usain Bolt&#x27;s Tracks and Records restaurant and became home to Starbucks&#x27; first Jamaican location, at Doctor&#x27;s Cave Beach, in November 2017. The city also serves as the Head Office for Starbucks&#x27; operations in Jamaica.

==Institutions==
The city hosts many financial institutions such as Scotiabank, FCIB, National Commercial Bank, Jamaica National Commercial Bank (JN Bank) and many others. The city also has offices for many auditing firms such as KPMG and PwC.

The city is home to many health institutions such as the Cornwall Regional Hospital as well as the recently opened Hospiten, a Spanish-owned, private hospital located in Rose Hall.

Education in the city can be found from Pre-K up to Tertiary. The city has many Pre-K and Basic Schools. Beyond this, the city has many Primary and Preparatory Schools. Secondary Education is also provided in the city, most notable institutions being the Montego Bay High School for Girls, Mount Alvernia High School—a Roman Catholic High School for Girls which shares the same crest, motto and wears a uniform similar to that of sister school of Immaculate Conception High School in Kingston, Herbert Morrison Technical High School and the oldest school in the city, Cornwall College, an all-boys&#x27; school.

Tertiary institutions in the city are the University of West Indies (UWI) – Western Jamaica Campus, the University of Technology (UTECH) Montego Bay Campus, Sam Sharpe Teachers&#x27; College (SSTC) and the Montego Bay Community College (MBCC). Most tertiary institutions in the city are accredited.

==Transport==

===Roads===
The North Coast Highway runs through the city of Montego Bay, with 2 lanes in each direction within the city, terminating at the Queen&#x27;s Drive and resuming at the intersection of the Alice Eldemire Drive and Barnett Street. The North Coast Highway connects Montego Bay with the North-South section of Highway 2000 (called T3), which begins at Mammee Bay in Ocho Rios, St. Ann and terminates at an interchange which leads onto the Mandela Highway in St. Catherine and into the nation&#x27;s capital, Kingston.

Another major road within the city is the B15 (Montego Bay to Falmouth) road. The city is also well served by buses, mini-busses and taxis, which operate from the Montego Bay Transport Centre.

The Government of Jamaica announced that a tolled bypass to the city has been planned to be built in order to reduce traffic congestion and travel times. The bypass is to begin at Westgate and end at Ironshore. The bypass is expected to cost around USD $200 Million.

===Rail===
The now disused Montego Bay railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line. The railway station opened c. 1894, and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica&#x27;s railways abruptly ceased.

===Air===
Montego Bay is served by Jamaica&#x27;s largest airport, the Sangster International Airport. The airport has the distinction of being the busiest airport in the English-speaking Caribbean, serving 4.3 million passengers in 2017.

The airport was the hub of Jamaica&#x27;s former national airline Air Jamaica. The airline also had its reservations, Western Jamaica sales &amp; ticketing office, as well as its vacations division in the city until its purchase by Caribbean Airlines in 2011, when they moved their offices to Kingston. The site is now the headquarters for Island Routes, a company owned by the Sandals-ATL Group, which in the past was affiliated with the airline.

The airport is served by several North American and European airlines, connecting the island with the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and South America. The southern U.S. city of Miami can be reached within 70 minutes. The southern U.S. cities of Charlotte, Houston, Atlanta and Tampa can be reached by non-stop flights in less than three hours. Other locations like Philadelphia, New York City, Toronto, Washington, D.C., and Montreal can be reached in under four hours. The airport has undergone major expansion since 2003, and has won awards including the coveted World Travel Award for being the Caribbean&#x27;s Leading Airport, beating airports like Punta Cana International Airport and Grantley Adams International Airport.

===Port===
There is a free port and cruise line terminal on a man-made peninsula jutting into the bay.

==Communications==
===Fixed voice and broadband===
Fixed voice and broadband services in Montego Bay is provided by FLOW. FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP &amp; POTS and cable broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. This copper network is currently being upgraded to VDSL2, which may allow speeds of over 50 Mbit/s over existing copper lines as well as provide a migration path for the provider to Fibre to the Home. FLOW also has a fibre-optic network in the neighbourhood of Rhyne Park which provides up to 100 Mbit/s as well. There are several other small cable companies such as Cornwall Communications, that provides cable broadband and voice over its cable network; however, they are vastly incomparable in subscriber numbers to FLOW.

===Mobile voice and broadband===
Mobile voice and broadband services in Montego Bay is dominated by both incumbents, FLOW &amp; Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, 3G HSPA &amp; HSPA+ connectivity in and around the city.

Currently, FLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz with speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s. FLOW also offers LTE data in Montego Bay. The company is the currently the only carrier to provide comprehensive LTE coverage within the city itself. Coverage also extends out towards to the adjoining rural areas surrounding Montego Bay such as Liliput to east and Hopewell (in the parish of Hanover) to the west. FLOW&#x27;s LTE network uses LTE Band 4, commonly known as AWS. Users can avail themselves of speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up. In some areas in the city, FLOW subscribers are able to access LTE Advanced with speeds up to 225 Mbit/s; making Montego Bay the only city in Jamaica to have access to such.

Digicel, Jamaica&#x27;s larger mobile network, also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+; however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on paired 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel&#x27;s LTE network is also available in Montego Bay, owing to its commitment to provide an islandwide LTE network, offering LTE in the city for its subscribers. The network is theoretically capable of speeds up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.

<doc id="396758" wikidata="Q3185794" url="?curid=396758" title="Joseph Williamson (English politician)">
<text>Sir Joseph Williamson, PRS (25 July 1633 – 3 October 1701) was an English civil servant, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons of England variously between 1665 and 1701 and in the Irish House of Commons between 1692 and 1699. He was Secretary of State for the Northern Department from 1674 to 1679.

==Early life==
Williamson was born at Bridekirk, near Cockermouth in Cumberland, where his father, also called Joseph, was vicar. His father died when he was very young, and his mother remarried the Reverend John Ardery. His relatively humble origins were often referred to unkindly in later life by his enemies, especially after he married into the aristocracy. He was educated at St. Bees School, Westminster School and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow.

==Early career==

In 1660 he entered the service of the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Sir Edward Nicholas, retaining his position under the succeeding secretary, Sir Henry Bennet, afterwards Earl of Arlington. He made himself indispensable to Arlington, due to his enormous capacity for hard work, which resulted in his employer delegating most of the routine work of the department to him. He was involved with the foundation of the London Gazette in 1665.

Williamson was elected Member of Parliament for Thetford in 1669 and held the seat until 1685. No less than three previous attempts to enter Parliament had been unsuccessful, due to an increasing &quot;backlash&quot; against Government candidates. Samuel Pepys in his celebrated Diary records that when Williamson appeared at the hustings in 1666, he was shouted down by cries of &quot;No courtiers!&quot; In 1672 he was made one of the clerks of the council and was knighted.

During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he drew up plans for the Zealand Expedition which was intended to land a newly formed English Army in the Netherlands. The strategy was abandoned after the naval defeat at the Battle of Texel and the Treaty of Westminster which ended the war.

In 1673 and 1674 he represented his country at the Congress of Cologne, and in the latter year he became Secretary of State for the Northern Department, having practically purchased this position from Arlington for £6,000, a sum that he required from his successor when he left office in 1679. He served as Master of The Clothworkers&#x27; Company from 1676 to 1677. In 1677, he became the second President of the Royal Society, but his main interests, after politics, were in antiquarian rather than in scientific matters.

As Secretary of State, he largely continued Arlington&#x27;s policy of friendship towards France, and hostility towards the Netherlands. Sir Joseph represented England at the Congress of Nijmegen (1678–79). William III of Orange developed a deep aversion to Williamson: quite apart from their opposing policies, he is said to have found the tone of Williamson&#x27;s dispatches unbearably patronising (&quot;as though I was a child to be fed on whipped cream&quot; William grumbled).

==Popish Plot==
Just before his removal from the post of Secretary of State, he was arrested on a charge of being implicated in the &quot;Popish Plot&quot;, but he was at once released by order of Charles II. Williamson was a particular target of the informers because he was one of the few Ministers who openly disbelieved in the Plot: when Israel Tonge first approached him with &quot;information&quot;, Williamson, who believed, with some reason, that Tonge was insane, gave him a &quot;rude repulse&quot;. As for the other informers, several of whom were members of London&#x27;s criminal underworld, his efficient intelligence service no doubt told him everything necessary about their characters. For this reason, the King, who was equally sceptical about the Plot&#x27;s reality, wished to retain his services, at least in the short term. The actual charge made against Williamson, of commissioning Roman Catholic army officers, was entirely spurious since these officers were intended for foreign service.

Williamson&#x27;s nerve began to give way under the strain of the Plot, and he became a political liability. Charles finally dismissed him after he gave orders to search Somerset House, the Queen&#x27;s official residence, without the King&#x27;s permission; the King, &quot;in great anger&quot; told him that &quot;I marvel at your effrontery in searching my house... your head is turning...I do not wish to be served by a man who fears anyone more than me&quot;. Danby was suspected by many of having a part in Williamson&#x27;s downfall, as he was said to have taken offence at Williamson&#x27;s recent marriage to Lady Clifton, a wealthy widow and cousin of the King.

==Marriage==
His marriage, at the beginning of the Popish Plot, should on the face of it have strengthened him politically: his wife was Katherine Stewart, Baroness Clifton, daughter of George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny, and sister of Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, and thus a member of a junior branch of the Stuart dynasty. Her first husband, by whom she had several children, was Henry O&#x27;Brien, Lord Ibrackan(c. 1642 – 1 September 1678), an old friend of Williamson; she and Williamson had no children.

Despite the obvious advantages of the match to Williamson himself, John Evelyn reported that it was very unpopular, and it probably weakened Williamson politically. Since Katherine as well as her first husband was an old friend of Williamson she was not a surprising choice as a bride; but the fact that O&#x27;Brien had been dead for only three months when she remarried gave rise to ill-natured gossip that Williamson and Katherine had been lovers during her first marriage: &quot;&#x27;Tis said they live together less happily than &quot;before&quot; they married&quot; ran one gibe. More seriously in an age of marked class distinctions, it was considered improper that the sister of a Royal Duke should marry a country clergyman&#x27;s son, and even her children are said to have objected to the marriage. Danby, who reportedly thought that Katherine would be a good match for his own son, was suspected of having had a hand in Williamson&#x27;s downfall.

==Later career==
After a period of comparative inactivity, in 1698 he signed the Treaty of The Hague (1698), the first treaty for the partition of the Spanish Monarchy. It was characteristic of William III that despite his personal dislike of Williamson, so evident in the 1670s, he did not hesitate to make use of his diplomatic skills. The negotiations had been kept a strict secret, and news of the Treaty caused uproar in England, but Williamson himself escaped any serious censure.

In 1690, Williamson was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester and held the seat until 1701. He was also elected MP for Thetford in three separate elections, but each time chose to sit for Rochester instead.

Between 1692 and 1695, Williamson was also MP in the Irish House of Commons for County Clare. In 1695 he represented Portarlington for a few months and subsequently Limerick City until 1699. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1696, as a tribute to his interest in civic improvements in Dublin. In return, he presented the city fathers with a silver cup.

==Death and reputation==
Williamson died at Cobham, Kent, on 3 October 1701, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his widow joined him a year later. He had become very rich by taking advantage of the many opportunities of making money which his official position gave him; and despite the heavy debts left by her brother, his wife is also said to have brought him a fortune. He left £6,000 and his library to Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford; £5,000 to found a school at Rochester, Sir Joseph Williamson&#x27;s Mathematical School; and £2,000 to Thetford. A great number of Williamson&#x27;s letters, dispatches, memoranda, etc., are among the English state papers.

He has been described as one of the greatest English civil servants of his time, and is credited with building up an intelligence service as efficient as that which John Thurloe had operated under Oliver Cromwell. His detailed notes of Privy Council meetings are an invaluable source of information about its operation, especially in the political crisis of 1678–79. On the other hand, he was a poor public speaker: even Charles II, himself a very hesitant speaker, complained of his &quot;droning&quot;.

Despite his gifts, he was not popular, being described as dry, formal and arrogant, an uncertain friend and a harsh employer. Many of his colleagues, like Sir Leoline Jenkins, felt the lash of his sharp tongue. On the other hand, his will, in which he remembered all those who had a claim on him, suggests that he did not lack a certain generosity of character; and he was capable of forming lifelong friendships, notably with Samuel Pepys.

==In fiction==
He is a recurring character in the Thomas Chaloner series of mystery novels by Susanna Gregory, in which he plays a somewhat villainous role: his wife and her first husband appear in the seventh book in the series, &quot;The Piccadilly Plot&quot;. Williamson also appears regularly in Andrew Taylor&#x27;s series of novels about the adventures of Whitehall clerk James Marwood and architect Cat Lovett.

<text>Christopher Henry Difford (born 4 November 1954) is an English musician. He is a founding member and songwriter of the rock group Squeeze.

==Early life==
Difford was born in Greenwich, London, on 4 November 1954, the youngest of three sons. His mother, Isabel (née Hamilton) was from Northern Ireland and met Difford&#x27;s father Sidney Lewis Difford (1919–2001) while he was stationed in Belfast during World War II.

== Music career==
Difford has written lyrics for over 50 years, most notably in partnership with Glenn Tilbrook. The two were primary members in Squeeze and Difford &amp; Tilbrook. According to Difford, he stole 50p from his mother&#x27;s purse to put a card in a local sweetshop window advertising for a guitarist to join his band, although he did not have one at the time. Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advert and they met for the first time shortly afterwards. Some of their best-known songs are &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot;, &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;Up the Junction&quot; and &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.
After the break-up of Squeeze in 1983, Difford continued writing songs for artists such as Jools Holland, Helen Shapiro, Billy Bremner and Elvis Costello. He has also written lyrics for music by Jools Holland, Elton John, Wet Wet Wet, Marti Pellow and others. He was involved with Tilbrook and John Turner in the creation of a musical, &quot;Labelled with Love&quot;, which was created using the songs of Squeeze. The 1983 musical performed in Deptford was short-lived. In 1984, the pair released the album &quot;Difford and Tilbrook&quot; and had a minor hit in the UK with &quot;Love&#x27;s Crashing Waves&quot; which reached 57 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1985, Squeeze reunited, having hits in the US with the album &quot;Babylon and On&quot;, plus the singles &quot;Hourglass&quot; and &quot;853-5937&quot;. Difford left the group in 1999 launching a solo career in 2003 with his album &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Get Where I Am&quot;. Difford was also manager of Bryan Ferry and The Strypes. Squeeze reunited again in 2007, and Difford maintained a concurrent solo career alongside his work with the band.

In March 2010, Difford curated &quot;Songs in the Key of London&quot;, an evening of music dedicated to the capital at the Barbican Centre, London.

In 2017, Difford published his autobiography, &quot;Some Fantastic Place: My Life In and Out of Squeeze&quot;.

Since 2014, Difford has been running the annual Chris Difford Songwriting Retreat, under the auspices of the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation, providing an opportunity for artists to collaborate with one another to write new songs and create new friendships in a relaxed setting in the English countryside.

In August 2021, Difford launched a podcast series, &quot;I Never Thought It Would Happen&quot;, with the charity Help Musicians, a charity he is an ambassador for, speaking to guests including Sting, Robbie Williams and KT Tunstall about the highs and lows of life in music. 

==Personal life==
Difford was raised in Greenwich. He lived in New York with his first wife and their two children. He then lived in Rye, Sussex, with the mother of his two youngest children. Currently, he lives just outside Brighton, Sussex, with his wife, Louise, whom he married in April 2013.

<text>Nizar ben Abdelaziz Trabelsi (born 2 July 1970) is a Tunisian former professional footballer. In 2003, he was convicted as terrorist and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment for his association with Al-Qaeda, and for plotting to attack US targets including American soldiers stationed at the Belgian airbase Kleine Brogel Air Base.

==Football career==
Trabelsi played in Germany for Fortuna Düsseldorf, Wuppertaler SV, 1. FC Wülfrath, SV 09/35 Wermelskirchen and VfR Neuss, as a midfielder.

==Association with Al-Qaeda==
Trabelsi had traveled to Afghanistan and met Osama bin Laden on several occasions. In 2001, Trabelsi was suspected of plotting to attack a US embassy in Paris, which was uncovered and stopped. He is said to be the designated suicide bomber, and was to wear a business suit to conceal the strapped bomb onto himself before walking into the embassy.

Trabelsi was arrested in an apartment, in Uccle near Brussels, Belgium on 13 September 2001. He was also implicated by Briton Saajid Badat, who alleged that both of them had conspired with Richard Reid supposedly to blow up two US-bound airliners using shoe bombs simultaneously.

===Conviction===
In 2003, Trabelsi was sentenced to a ten-year prison term in Belgium, for plotting to attack the Kleine Brogel Air Base. He was also found guilty of illegal weapons possession and being a member in a private militia. On 3 October 2013, he was extradited to the United States. In September 2014, the European Court of Human Rights found that his deportation was performed in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered Belgium to pay 60,000 euros in damages to Trabelsi.

Trabelsi was extradited to the United States in October 2013, after he completed his sentence in Belgium.

, he remained in jail in solitary confinement, in Washington D.C., awaiting trial. On 14 July, 2023, he was found not guilty in an American federal court. Despite the outcome of this trial, Trabelsi remains to be held in jail, also in solitary confinement, in what he calls &quot;a black hole&quot;. The cell measures 3.5 by 3.5 meters, the light is burning constantly, and he is only allowed to leave the cell for one hour per day. The European Court of Human Rights has on multiple occasions convicted the governments of Belgium for the circumstances Trabelsi is living in since his deportation. As a consequence of these rulings, national courts in Brussels have demanded for Trabelsi to be extradited back to Belgium, with a penalty for the federal government of Belgium of up to €200.000 if this demand is not met.

==Beliefs==
Five ordinances are recognized: baptism by immersion, biblical church government, the Lord&#x27;s Supper, feet washing and tithing.
