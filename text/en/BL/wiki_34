<text>Lewis &quot;Duke&quot; Baltz (September 12, 1945 – November 22, 2014) was an American visual artist, photographer, and educator. He was an important figure in the New Topographics movement of the late 1970s. His best known work was monochrome photography of suburban landscapes and industrial parks which highlighted his commentary of void within the &quot;American Dream&quot;.

He wrote for many journals, and contributed regularly to &quot;L&#x27;Architecture d&#x27;Aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;.

Baltz&#x27;s work is held in the collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

==Early life and education==
Lewis Baltz was born on September 12, 1945, in Newport Beach, California. His father died when he was age 11.

Baltz attended Monterey Peninsula College in 1967. He later graduated with a BFA degree in fine arts from San Francisco Art Institute in 1969; and held a Master of Fine Arts degree from Claremont Graduate School (now Claremont Graduate University). 

== Career ==
His work is focused on searching for beauty in desolation and destruction. Baltz&#x27;s images describe the architecture of the human landscape: offices, factories and parking lots. His pictures are the reflection of control, power, and influenced by and over human beings. His minimalistic photographs in the trilogy &quot;Ronde de Nuit, Docile Bodies,&quot; and &quot;Politics of Bacteria,&quot; picture the void of the other. In 1974 he captured the anonymity and the relationships between inhabitation, settlement and anonymity in &quot;The New Industrial Parks near Irvine, California&quot;.

His books and exhibitions, his &quot;topographic work&quot;, such as &quot;The New Industrial Parks,&quot; &quot;Nevada, San Quentin Point, Candlestick Point&quot;, expose the crisis of technology and define both objectivity and the role of the artist in photographs. His work &quot;Candlestick Point&quot; is made of 84 photographs documenting a public space near Candlestick Park, ruined by natural detritus and human intervention.

Baltz moved to Europe in the late 1980s and started to use large colored prints. 

He published several books of his work including &quot;Geschichten von Verlangen und Macht,&quot; with Slavica Perkovic (Scalo, 1986). Other photographic series, including &quot;Sites of Technology&quot; (1989–92), depict the clinical, pristine interiors of hi-tech industries and government research centres, principally in France and Japan. In 1995, the story &quot;Deaths in Newport&quot; was produced as a book and CD-ROM. Baltz also produced a number of video works.

Baltz taught at various institutions, including Claremont Graduate School, California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), University of California, Riverside (UC Riverside), California State University, San Bernardino, and the IUAV University in Venice, Italy, where in 2006 he co-founded the Arsenale Institute for Politics of Representation.

== End of life, death and legacy ==
In 2002, Baltz became a professor for photography at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. He lived his last years between Paris and Venice. Baltz died on November 22, 2014, in Paris at the age of 69 following a long illness.

== Awards ==
He received several scholarships and awards including a scholarship from the National Endowment For the Arts (1973, 1977), the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship (1977), US-UK Bicentennial Exchange Fellowship (1980), and Charles Brett Memorial Award (1991).

<doc id="399808" wikidata="Q604524" url="?curid=399808" title="Glen A. Larson">
<text>Glen Albert Larson (January 3, 1937 – November 14, 2014) was an American television producer, writer, and composer. He created many series, including &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, &quot;The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;B. J. and the Bear&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. Active on television until the early 2010s, he was also a member of the folk revival/satire group The Four Preps.

== Career ==
Larson began his career in the entertainment industry in 1956 as a member of the vocal group The Four Preps, with whom he appeared in one of the &quot;Gidget&quot; films. The Four Preps ultimately produced three gold records for Capitol, all of which Larson himself wrote and/or composed: &quot;26 Miles (Santa Catalina)&quot;, &quot;Big Man&quot;, and &quot;Down by the Station&quot;. A later member of the Four Preps, David Somerville, and a session singer he knew, Gail Jensen, later collaborated with Larson to write and compose &quot;The Unknown Stuntman&quot;, the theme from &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;; series lead Lee Majors performed this song over the opening titles.

After working for Quinn Martin on productions including &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (where he had his first writing credit), Larson signed a production deal with Universal Studios. His first hit series was &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, a 1971–1973 Western which described the activities of Hannibal Heyes and Jedediah &quot;Kid&quot; Curry, concentrating on their efforts to go straight. (George Roy Hill&#x27;s film, scripted by William Goldman, about Butch Cassidy and the &quot;Sundance Kid&quot;, is commonly believed to have been the inspiration for the series.)

Larson was involved in the development for television of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, based on Martin Caidin&#x27;s novel &quot;Cyborg&quot;, into the successful series, and was one of the program&#x27;s early executive producers.

Larson later secured a then-unprecedented $1 million per episode budget for &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The show incorporated many themes from Mormon theology, such as sealing (marriage) for &quot;time and eternity&quot; and a &quot;council of twelve&quot;. Larson, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in real life, had been working on the concept since 1968 with former &quot;Star Trek&quot; producer Gene L. Coon mentoring him in its early development. Although, he originally wanted to name the series &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ark&quot;, he instead opted for &quot;Galactica&quot;. He was later convinced to include the word &quot;star&quot; in the title to capitalize on the recently released film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, eventually morphing the title into &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Larson was similarly convinced to deviate from his plan to produce the property as a series of TV movies to a weekly hour-long series, which caught his crew by surprise with a production schedule more demanding than originally expected in terms of writing while it overwhelmed the series&#x27; budgetary limits.

Even with its generous budget, the series often recycled effects shots and was canceled after one season. The pilot episode, titled &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot; was edited into a two-hour theatrical film and a re-edit of the other episodes was released as a second theatrical feature film titled &quot;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack&quot;. After the series was canceled, Larson went on to create a relatively low-budget sequel titled &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, which was set many years later, when the &quot;Galactica&quot; had reached Earth. It was less successful than the original and was canceled after 10 episodes.

Larson re-used some of the sets, props, costumes, and effects work from &quot;Galactica&quot; for the light-hearted sci-fi series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; in 1979. Based on the comic-book character created in 1928 by Philip Francis Nowlan, Larson co-developed the series with Leslie Stevens. The feature-length pilot episode was released as a theatrical film in March 1979 and grossed $21 million at the North American box office. The weekly television series began in September 1979, running for two seasons until April 1981.

In the 1980s, Larson had further success as one of the creators of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, which ran from 1980 to 1988. Around the same time, he left Universal to work for 20th Century-Fox. Additionally, Larson created &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, which ran from 1981 to 1986. Larson&#x27;s next prominent series was &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, which featured science-fiction elements with a light-hearted action-adventure scenario and limited violence. These basic elements characterized many of Larson&#x27;s series&#x27; throughout the 1980s with &quot;Automan&quot;, &quot;Manimal&quot; and &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, though all of these shows were unsuccessful and none lasted more than a single season. Larson&#x27;s profile declined, though he made a brief comeback in the 1990s with an adaptation of the Ultraverse comic &quot;Night Man&quot;, which lasted two seasons.

In 2003, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was remade for the Sci-Fi Channel as a miniseries; it was followed by a 2004 series, that, unlike the original, lasted multiple seasons. Larson was not involved in any capacity with the new series, though he did receive a screen credit as &quot;Consulting Producer&quot;. After the series ended in 2009, a short-lived prequel series, &quot;Caprica&quot;, followed in 2010. Larson was again not involved, but he was given a screen credit for the creation of certain characters.

In February 2009, media sources reported that Larson was in talks with Universal Pictures to bring &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; to the big screen, though any potential feature film would not be based on the recent Sci-Fi Channel series remake, but would possibly be based on the original series. The project stalled for some time; in 2011 a re-announced version was now no longer a continuation of the original series but rather a complete remake.

=== Criticism ===
Despite his success, much criticism has been aimed at Larson for his perceived general lack of originality as many of his television series are seen as small screen &quot;knock-offs&quot; of feature films. Harlan Ellison once referred to him as &quot;Glen Larceny&quot; for the notorious similarities between Larson&#x27;s shows and cinema blockbusters.

In his autobiography, &quot;The Garner Files&quot;, James Garner stated that Larson stole a number of plots of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (which Garner&#x27;s production company co-produced), then used them for his own shows, simply changing the dialogue minimally and using different character names. Garner&#x27;s group complained to the Writer&#x27;s Guild; Larson was fined, and an episode of Larson&#x27;s series &quot;Switch&quot; called &quot;Death by Resurrection&quot; had the writing credits revised to give sole credit to the writers of the original &quot;Rockford Files&quot; episode &quot;This Case Is Closed&quot;, as it was very clearly the basis of the &quot;Switch&quot; episode. Nevertheless, Garner felt that the fine had taught Larson nothing when he persisted in plagiarism and later copied the theme music from &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; for one of his shows. Garner stated that when Larson subsequently showed up on the &quot;Rockford&quot; set, he put his arm around Garner and said: &quot;I hope there are no hard feelings, Jim.&quot; After Larson ignored a warning by Garner to take his arm off him, Garner reportedly punched Larson so hard that Larson &quot;flew across the curb, into a motor home, and out the other side.&quot;

=== Lawsuit against Universal Studios ===
In July 2011, Larson began a lawsuit against Universal Studios, alleging a decades-long fraud and claimed the studio had not paid him a share of the profits owed from the television shows he produced while working with them. Larson&#x27;s involvement with Universal had begun in the 1970s, and his contractual agreement had secured him net profits from the revenues generated by the shows he worked on as a producer, including &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. The dispute was settled four years later in December 2015.

This was not the first legal wrangle Larson had with the studio, as there had previously been a disagreement over ownership of rights to the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; franchise. It was ultimately determined that Larson no longer owned the television rights to the property, but retained feature film rights.

== Death ==
Larson died on November 14, 2014, in UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, California, from esophageal cancer, aged 77 and was survived by his wife Jeannie and nine children. He is buried at Rose Hill Burial Park (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma).

<text>The name weak consistency can be used in two senses. In the first sense, strict and more popular, weak consistency is one of the consistency models used in the domain of concurrent programming (e.g. in distributed shared memory, distributed transactions etc.). 

A protocol is said to support weak consistency if:
#All accesses to synchronization variables are seen by all processes (or nodes, processors) in the same order (sequentially) - these are synchronization operations. Accesses to critical sections are seen sequentially.
#All other accesses may be seen in different order on different processes (or nodes, processors).
#The set of both read and write operations in between different synchronization operations is the same in each process.

Therefore, there can be no access to a synchronization variable if there are pending write operations. And there can not be any new read/write operation started if the system is performing any synchronization operation.

In the second, more general, sense weak consistency may be applied to any consistency model weaker than sequential consistency.

A stricter condition is strong consistency, where parallel processes can observe only one consistent state.

<doc id="399813" wikidata="Q1258959" url="?curid=399813" title="John Jakes">
<text>John William Jakes (March 31, 1932 – March 11, 2023) was an American writer, best known for historical and speculative fiction. His American Civil War trilogy, &quot;North and South&quot;, has sold millions of copies worldwide. He was also the author of The Kent Family Chronicles. Jakes used the pen name Jay Scotland among others.

==Early life and education==
Jakes was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 31, 1932. He first sold stories to pulp magazines while still in college in the early 1950s. Jakes studied creative writing at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, graduating in 1953. He then earned an MA in American literature from Ohio State University. He and Rachel, to whom he had been married for 13 months at the time, appeared on the game show &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; on August 23, 1952. Although they failed to complete the Bonus Round, Rachel won a Sylvania &quot;Jefferson&quot; 20&quot; screen television set. In 1961, Jakes moved to Dayton, Ohio. He lived there for ten years and worked as a copywriter for several advertising agencies while he wrote fiction at night and on the weekends. In 1971, he began to write full-time.

==Writing career==

&quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, edited by Sam Merwin, published two 1949–1950 letters from Jakes and two of his stories were published in pulp magazines edited by Howard Browne late in 1950, &quot;The Dreaming Trees&quot; (&quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, November) and &quot;Your Number Is Up!&quot; (&quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, December). Jakes sold his first short story (1,500 words) in 1950.

28 more speculative fiction stories by Jakes were published 1951 to 1953. He then published dozens of stories and several novels during the twenty years following completion of college, many of them fantasy fiction, science fiction and westerns, and other sorts of historical fiction. 

During this time, he was a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. The eight original members were self-selected by fantasy credentials alone. They sought to promote the popularity and respectability of the &quot;Sword and Sorcery&quot; subgenre (such as Brak the Barbarian stories by Jakes).

Jakes gained widespread popularity with the publication of his &quot;Kent Family Chronicles&quot;, which became a bestselling American Bicentennial Series of books in the mid- to late 1970s, selling 55 million copies. He subsequently published several more popular works of historical fiction, most dealing with American history, including the &quot; North and South&quot; trilogy about the U.S. Civil War, which sold 10 million copies and was adapted as an ABC miniseries.

In 1988, Jakes&#x27;s stage adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was first performed at his home theater on Hilton Head Island. It has since become popular for production by many universities and regional theaters, including the Alabama Shakespeare Festival.

In September 2013, Jakes was named a Florida Literary Legend at the Florida Heritage Book Festival and Writers Conference in St. Augustine, Florida.

==Personal life and death==
Jakes lived on Bird Key in Sarasota, Florida, with his wife, Rachel, to whom he had been married from 1951. They had four grown children: Andrea, Dr. Ellen, J. Michael, and Victoria.

Jakes died in Sarasota on March 11, 2023, at the age of 90.

<text>The gray-crowned rosy finch or gray-crowned rosy-finch (Leucosticte tephrocotis) is a species of passerine bird in the family Fringillidae native to Alaska, western Canada, and the north-western United States. Due to its remote and rocky alpine habitat it is rarely seen. There are currently six recognized subspecies. It is one of four species of rosy finches.

==Taxonomy==

The gray-crowned rosy finch was first classified by English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832. This bird has been thought to form a superspecies with three other rosy finches (also known as mountain finch): black rosy finch &quot;(L. atrata)&quot; and the brown-capped rosy finch &quot;(L. australis)&quot;, all of which were classified as the same species as the Asian rosy finch &quot;(L. arctoa)&quot; from 1983 to 1993. Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another. Along with one Asian rosy finch and two Asian mountain finches, the three North American rosy finches form the mountain finch genus &quot;Leucosticte&quot;. Alternative common names include: Roselin à tête grise (in French), Schwarzstirn-Schneegimpel (in German), and Pinzón Montano Nuquigrís (in Spanish).

===Subspecies===
Six subspecies of the gray-crowned rosy finch are now recognized, though proposals for additional subspecies have been recognized.

*&quot;L. t. griseonucha&quot; (J. F. Brandt, 1842) Commander Island, and Aleutian Islands (including Shumagin Island and Semidi Island) east to Alaskan Peninsula; non-breeding south to Kodiak Island.
*&quot;L. t. umbrina&quot; (O. Murie, 1944) Hall Island, St. Matthew Island and Pribilof Islands, in Bering Sea.
*&quot;L. t. littoralis&quot; (S. F. Baird, 1869) also known as &quot;Hepburn’s rosy-finch&quot;, &quot;gray-headed rosy-finch&quot;, &quot;gray-cheeked rosy-finch&quot;, breeds in south-central Alaska east to western Canada (SW Yukon, NW British Columbia) and western United States from Washington and Oregon (along Cascade Mountains) to northern California (Mt Shasta); winters in southern section of breeding range East to central Montana, western Nevada, northern Utah and central New Mexico.
*&quot;L. t. tephrocotis&quot; (Swainson, 1832) also known as &quot;brown-cheeked rosy-finch&quot;, breeds northern &amp; central Alaska east to northwest Canada (central Yukon, British Columbia, western Alberta) and northwest United States (northwest Montana); winters from southern British Columbia east to southwest Saskatchewan and South Dakota, south to northeast California, Nevada, Utah, western Colorado and northern New Mexico.
*&quot;L. t. wallowa&quot; (A. H. Miller, 1939) breeds northeast Oregon (Wallowa Mts); winters South to west-central Nevada and central-east California.
*&quot;L. t. dawsoni&quot; (J. Grinnell, 1913) eastern California (Sierra Nevada and White Mts).

==Description==

Within the finch family, the gray-crowned rosy finch is medium-large with a comparatively long notched tail and wing. Adults are brown on the back and breast and mainly pink on the rest of the underparts and the wings. The forehead and throat are black; the back of the head is grey. They have short black legs and a long forked tail. There is some variability in the amount of grey on the head. Adult females and juveniles are similar. Overall length is , wingspan , and weight . &quot;L. t. wallowa&quot; has an almost entirely gray head. The Pribilof and Aleutian subspecies have a length of and weight of , about twice the size of the other subspecies. The black rosy finch has a black instead of brown body and the brown-capped rosy finch is a lighter brown and lacks the gray face patch.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ancestor of the three species of North American rosy finches migrated from Asia. All rosy finches live in an alpine or tundra environment. The gray-crowned rosy finch has a wide range and large numbers throughout Alaska, and western Canada and the United States. &quot;L. t. griseonucha&quot; permanently resides in the Aleutian Islands and &quot;umbrina&quot; on the Pribilof Islands. A small number of gray-crowned rosy finches winters on the mainland in South-Central Alaska and visits feeders there. The other taxa: &quot;littoralis&quot;, &quot;tephrocotis&quot;, &quot;wallowa&quot;, and &quot;dawsoni&quot; are found from the Canadian and American Rockies and migrate south to the western United States. &quot;L. t. tephrocotis&quot; summers from Montana to the Yukon, while &quot;littoralis&quot; breeds closer to the coast, from northern California to west-central Alaska. Due to its remote habitat, few of its nests have been found, it is rarely spotted, and the population is stable. They are invariably found amongst rocks. The areas the subspecies breed in rarely overlap during breeding season. Males typically outnumber females throughout the year.
An individual was seen north of Boonville, in Lewis County, NY beginning on Sunday, March 4 through at least Thursday, March 8. This is only the second confirmed report for New York State.

==Behavior==
Rosy finches are very environment-specific. In the summer their breeding habitat is rocky islands and barren areas on mountains from Alaska to the northwestern United States. These mountain breeding areas tend to be snowfields and rocky scree. When not breeding they form large flocks of over 1000 individuals which are sometimes known to include snow buntings (&quot;P. nivalis&quot;), Lapland longspurs (&quot;C. lapponicus&quot;), and horned larks (&quot;E. alpestris&quot;), as well as other rosy-finch species. They descend in flocks as far as the fringes of the western plains beginning in autumn when the snows get deep. They return to alpine regions when snow is still deep in early spring. They may breed at a higher altitude than any other breeding bird in North America. Due to these extreme breeding altitudes, they are very difficult to observe during breeding times. They build a cup nest in mid-June at a sheltered, hidden location on the ground or on a cliff and are monogamous. They are known to use protected areas such as mine shafts and abandoned buildings for nesting. Both sexes collect the nesting material of grass, roots, lichen, moss, and sedge, but only the female builds the nest. Lining material consists of fine grass, hair, and feathers. The female lays 3–5 eggs which she incubates for approximately two weeks. Both sexes feed the chicks, which leave the nest after 2–3 weeks. Chicks continue to be fed by their parents for about two weeks after leaving the nest in late July or early August. A male will defend its female&#x27;s territory during breeding season, not just the nest but wherever she goes. This behavior is common with the rosy finches.

These birds forage on the ground; many fly to catch insects in flight. During the summer they mainly eat insects, such as cutworms, that were caught in updrafts and frozen in snowfields. They also feed in the meadows near snowfields. In the winter they eat seeds from weeds and grasses such as Russian thistle (&quot;E. exaltatus&quot;), mustard, and sunflower (&quot;H. annuus&quot;). When breeding, both males and females develop throat pouches, known as gular pouches or gular skin, to carry food to their chicks, a trait seen in only one other North American genus, &quot;Pinicola&quot;. The three subspecies that live in mountain interiors have brown cheeks instead of gray cheeks. They show little fear of humans. They often feed in small flocks. Their call is a buzz-sounding &quot;chew&quot;. They can be approached to within .

<text>Memory coherence is an issue that affects the design of computer systems in which two or more processors or cores share a common area of memory.

In a uniprocessor system (where there exists only one core), there is only one processing element doing all the work and therefore only one processing element that can read or write from/to a given memory location. As a result, when a value is changed, all subsequent read operations of the corresponding memory location will see the updated value, even if it is cached.

Conversely, in multiprocessor (or multicore) systems, there are two or more processing elements working at the same time, and so it is possible that they simultaneously access the same memory location. Provided none of them changes the data in this location, they can share it indefinitely and cache it as they please. But as soon as one updates the location, the others might work on an out-of-date copy that, e.g., resides in their local cache. Consequently, some scheme is required to notify all the processing elements of changes to shared values; such a scheme is known as a memory coherence protocol, and if such a protocol is employed the system is said to have a coherent memory.

The exact nature and meaning of the memory coherency is determined by the consistency model that the coherence protocol implements. In order to write correct concurrent programs, programmers must be aware of the exact consistency model that is employed by their systems.

When implemented in hardware, the coherency protocol can, for example, be directory-based or snooping-based (also called &quot;sniffing&quot;). Specific protocols include the MSI protocol and its derivatives MESI, MOSI and MOESI.

<text>Michael Shaara (June 23, 1928 – May 5, 1988) was an American author of science fiction, sports fiction, and historical fiction. 

== Biography ==
Shaara was born to an Italian immigrant father (the family name was originally spelled Sciarra, which in Italian is pronounced in a similar way) in Jersey City, New Jersey, graduated in 1951 from Rutgers University, where he joined Theta Chi, and served as a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division prior to the Korean War.

Before Shaara began selling science fiction stories to fiction magazines during the 1950s, he was an amateur boxer and police officer. The stress combined with cigarette smoking led to a heart attack at the early age of 36. He managed to recover completely and later taught literature at Florida State University while continuing to write fiction. His novel about the Battle of Gettysburg, &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1975. Shaara died of a heart attack in 1988 at the age of 59.

Shaara&#x27;s children, Jeffrey and Lila, are also novelists. In 1997, Jeffrey Shaara established the annual &quot;Michael Shaara Award for Excellence in Civil War Fiction&quot;, awarded at Gettysburg College.

<text>The National Intelligence Service (NIS) (, abbreviated ) is the national intelligence agency of Greece. Originally modeled after the United States Central Intelligence Agency, it was established in 1953 as the Central Intelligence Service (, abbrev. ), specializing in intelligence gathering, counterintelligence activities and securing sensitive state communications.

As Greece&#x27;s primary intelligence agency, EYP is responsible for a range of domestic and foreign matters, ranging from criminal activities and civil rights violations, to terrorism and espionage. Although its agents can be armed for their protection, the agency does not have prosecutorial and detention powers. During wartime, it can fulfill the role of military intelligence, alongside the separate Military Intelligence Directorate (ΔΔΣΠ).

Headquartered in Athens, EYP is an autonomous civilian agency that answers directly to the Prime Minister of Greece. The majority of its 1,800 personnel are civil servants, although the agency also employs scientific and technical contractors, officers of each branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces, and members of the Hellenic Police and Hellenic Fire Service.

==Mission==
EYP&#x27;s mission is to advance Greece&#x27;s strategic interests by safeguarding political, financial, and military assets, preventing and countering criminal and military threats and collecting, processing and disseminating information to relevant authorities. This broad mandate grants the organization many responsibilities, including advising policymakers, cooperating with the Military Intelligence Directorate (ΔΔΣΠ) and Hellenic Police&#x27;s Directorate for Special Violent Crimes (Anti-Terrorist Service), the Directorate for Information Management and Analysis, and the Directorate of State Security (successor to the National Security Service), while coordinating with foreign partners.

==Personnel==
The incumbent Director of the National Intelligence Service is Themistocles Demiris. The two Deputy Directors are amb. Ioannis Raptakis and LtGen (ret.) Georgios Kellis.

The agency is directly responsible to the Prime Minister of Greece, who can appoint or dismiss the Director and his deputies.

EYP employs the following categories of personnel:
* Permanent civilian personnel.
* Scientific civilian personnel, serving on the basis of private contracts of employment.
* A number of officers on active service in the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard or the Hellenic Police. An unspecified number of national field agents are also employed.

The total number of people working for the agency is unknown and remains classified; the Greek media usually give figures of around 3,000.

From 1996 to 2019, responsibility for the service was delegated to Ministers of Public Order/Citizens Protection or the Interior.

==History==
The first modern Greek intelligence agency was created in February 1908, with the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fulfilling the role. It was headed by Panagiotis Danglis, a military officer and member of the Hellenic Macedonian Committee one of the secret organizations taking part in the Macedonian Struggle. The Information Department&#x27;s goal was the promotion of Greek propaganda as well as the collection of economic and military intelligence, through a network of Greek consulates in Ottoman-controlled Macedonia. The Department did not absorb or even collaborate with private Greek secret organizations that continued to act independently. Events such as the Goudi coup and the Young Turk Revolution, prompted a sharp reduction of Greek activity in Macedonia and the eventual dissolution of the agency in November 1909. At the outbreak of World War I Greece remained neutral. The National Schism divided the country into Royalists and Venizelists. Individual members of the military and the diplomatic corps focused their attention on collecting information on their political enemies. In June 1917, King Constantine I of Greece was deposed and the country entered the war on the side of the Entente. Greek officers gained valuable experience on aerial reconnaissance and interrogation techniques from their French and British allies during their tenure on the Macedonian front. 
In 1923, Italy occupied the Greek island of Corfu after accusing the latter of assassinating the Italian general Enrico Tellini. The Corfu incident prompted Greece to create the Corfu Information Center under Georgios Fessopoulos. The center was tasked with countering Italian propaganda, disrupting trade with Italy, limiting Catholic proselytism and the use of the Italian language. Apart from that the center also monitored the activities of Armenian refugees and pacifists residing on the island, for fear that they might be communist agents. On 25 September 1925, Theodoros Pangalos founded the National Special Security Service (YAK) under the auspices of the Hellenic Gendarmerie. Tasked with combating the seditious Communist Party of Greece, the organization was paralyzed by an internal power struggle. On 27 December, Fessopulos took over the YAK on 29 January 1926, YAK was renamed into the National General Security Service (YGAK), which now fell under the command of the Ministry of the Interior. The YGAK continued to gather intelligence on communists and illegal aliens. In August 1926, Pangalos was overthrown in a countercoup by Georgios Kondylis. Kondylis dissolved YGAK due to its close affiliation with Pangalos, leaving Greece without an intelligence agency for the next ten years.

In January 1936, the State Defense Service (Υπηρεσίας Αμύνης του Κράτους) was established under the Ministry for Military Affairs. Its responsibilities included &quot;monitoring of foreign propaganda carried out against the State, the movement and dwelling of foreign nationals in the country, the collection of intelligence relating to the security of the State and the introduction of counter-measures.&quot; On 5 November of that year, the service was dissolved by the Metaxas Regime &amp; was replaced by the Deputy Ministry for Public Security (Υφυπουργείο Δημόσιας Ασφάλειας).

=== After World War II ===
The agency, in its current form, was founded on 7 May 1953 (Law 2421/1953) under the name Central Intelligence Service (, ΚΥΠ). On 27 August 1986, it was renamed and re-established as the National Intelligence Service (, ΕΥΠ) by ministerial decree.

The agency was created by influential Greek American CIA agents, the most famous being Thomas Karamessines, who later rose to become Deputy Director for Plans in the CIA. Its first, most influential and longest-serving Director was Alexandros Natsinas, a Lieutenant General of Artillery and veteran of World War II and the Greek Civil War. He headed the agency from its founding in May 1953 until December 1963.

At the end of World War II, Albania came to be dominated by Enver Hoxha&#x27;s communist party which owed its ascension to power in part to the British MI6 which actively supported it during the war. The outbreak of the Cold War made Britain reverse its position on Albania initiating the Albanian Subversion operation. Britain sought the assistance of Greece which at the time was hostile towards Albania due to its territorial claims in Northern Epirus and Albania&#x27;s support for the Democratic Army of Greece. British reliance on the Albanian nationalist Balli Kombëtar militia created reluctance in the Greek intelligence community to collaborate with their erstwhile enemies. Nevertheless, the Manetta Villa in the Athenian suburb of Kifissia was used as a training ground for Albanian anticommunist guerillas. An MI6 communication center was set up in the Bibelli Villa in north east Corfu and an Albanian language propaganda radio station operated from the Alkyonides Islands. The latter came under the control of Central Intelligence Agency in 1950 and continued to function for four more years. KYPE supplied the British with information acquired from the Greek community in Albania as well as political refugees living in Lavrio camp. The Albanian Subversion was ultimately revealed by KGB double agent Kim Philby, the Albanian authorities conducted numerous arrests thus foiling the plot.

Between 1952 and 1961 KYPE and its successor KYP conducted a campaign of cultural propaganda against the Greek communist party (KKE) and the United Democratic Left (EDA). Reports were issued on the Trotskyist Fourth International as well as Titoism, those two currents of communism were to be reinforced in order to spread discord among the country&#x27;s leftists. On 17 November 1953, KYP proposed conducting tax audits on suspected communist book publishers and cinema owners, censoring Soviet movies and promoting Soviet films of particularly low quality. In 1959, KYP launched exhibitions of Soviet products in Volos, Thessaloniki and Piraeus. The bulk of the products were cheap and defective, purposefully selected to tarnish the Soviet Union&#x27;s image. In 1961, propaganda brochures such as &quot;The Mishellenic Propaganda of the Slavs and the Macedonian Question&quot; and &quot;KKE and Northern Epirus&quot; were printed and sent out to regional newspapers in the north of the country.

At the very beginning, the agency appointed an anticommunist role, as the country was under the consequences of the civil war and all the countries at the northern borders, were under communist regimes. KYP was controlled by the CIA; in the first eleven years of its history (1953–1964) its agents received their salaries from the Americans, not the Greek state, until Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, enraged with this level of dependence, stopped this practice. During the Regime of the Colonels (1967–1974), KYP actively continued its anticommunist action.

Between the late 1970s and the 1990s, KYP and EYP monitored the activities of foreign terrorist organizations such as the German Red Army Faction, the Palestinian Abu Nidal Organization, the Japanese Red Army, the Armenian ASALA, and the Turkish, PKK and Dev Sol. The presence of latter two was tolerated by Greece due to its geopolitical conflict with Turkey. Their members received political asylum, mainly settling in the Lavrio refugee camp. Despite PKK&#x27;s designation as a terrorist organization its members openly raised funds within Greece. Their activities were gradually restricted following the 1999 Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy thaw.

After Andreas Papandreou came to power in 1981, he was determined to totally control the state apparatus, including the intelligence services, which historically had been staffed exclusively by people with right-wing political views. The external attention was focused on the relations towards Turkey. He appointed as head of KYP Lieutenant General Georgios Politis, a close friend of retired General, PASOK MP and minister Antonis Drosogiannis; Politis organized a massive purge of right-wing personnel. KYP became a civilian agency, EYP, by Ministerial Decree 1645/86. In recent years, its directors have been diplomats, while traditionally they were military officers.

In late May 1985, KYP agents monitoring the activities of the Soviet embassy in Athens realized that its sports secretary Sergei Bokhan had vanished under mysterious circumstances. KYP suspected Bokhan to be either a KGB or a GRU operative, as was an approximate 40% of the embassy&#x27;s staff. Valery Goncharouk another suspected GRU agent and embassy worker also unexpectedly returned to Moscow. Unbeknownst to Greece Bokhan had been a MI6 double agent since 1974. On 17 May, Bokhan received an order to urgently return to the USSR in order to confirm a promotion. Fearing that his cover had been blown he escaped to USA with the help of CIA. Bokhan&#x27;s testimony was passed to KYP, revealing that he and Goncharouk had established a network of collaborators most of whom worked in the high tech sector. Amongst them were Greek navy officers specializing in computer engineering, a Greek contractor producing FIM-92 Stinger missiles and a contractor for the French defense manufacturer Thomson-CSF. The latter two were acquitted after the judge presiding over their case claimed that they had the right to engage in industrial espionage as the technology in question belonged to a foreign nation. The fact that the folders containing the documents were mailed through the regular post service and were not properly marked as classified also played a role in the court&#x27;s decision. The court-martial also ended in the officer&#x27;s favor, after Bokhan&#x27;s testimony was judged to be inadequate for a conviction.

In 1989, New Democracy MP Pavlos Bakoyannis was assassinated by members of Revolutionary Organization 17 November. New Democracy and CIA leveled the accusation that the PASOK political party was behind the creation of 17 November and Revolutionary People&#x27;s Struggle (ELA) another Greek far left terrorist organization. The New Democracy leadership continued to insist that the former had collaborated with PASOK even after 17 November disbanded in 2003. 17 November had in fact been founded by Alexandros Giotopoulos, a staunch opponent of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 and former member of the Paris anti–junta circles.

=== 1990s ===

On 5 March 1991, EYP conducted a series of arrests of Palestinian terrorists in Athens, seizing a number of explosive devices. On 19 April 1991, Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine militant Hashaykem Ahmed perpetrated a bombing in the city of Patras. The bombing resulted in seven fatalities and an equal number of injured. EYP had warned the central police headquarters that the leader of the local Palestinian student&#x27;s union was an Islamic Jihad member and possessed weaponry on 3 April. On 16 April, EYP once again issued a communique warning of a possible Islamic Jihad attack in Patras. It was later revealed that the central police headquarters had failed to pass the information to their Patras colleagues. A connection between the perpetrators of the bombing and the Palestine Liberation Organization led to the expulsion of five Palestinian diplomats and eight other Palestinians. The level of EYP&#x27;s awareness of Islamic Jihad&#x27;s movements within the country led to allegations by a number of people including the former interior minister Ioannis Skoularikis that the bombing had been a false flag operation by either CIA or Mossad.

=== Recent Years ===

During the recent years, EYP has also been active regarding cases of corruption in Greek football, such as the 2015 Greek football scandal and various attacks to Greek referees.

In 2021, a former Greek intelligence officer, who was in charge of the Kyrenia branch of the Greek National Intelligence Service admitted that Greece and the Junta of Dimitrios Ioannidis knew about the invasion from at least April of 1974, saying that &quot;if the Greek leadership wanted, the Turks would have suffered annihilation&quot;, this was said in an interview with the Cypriot state broadcaster, RIK.
The Officer also claims that all the evidence he had on this issue was also turned in to the Greek parliament during their investigation of the events of Cyprus (Later to be known as the Cyprus File), adding more details and claiming that although he was sending important intelligence signals to his superiors in Greece, he was getting no reply or instructions, including after informing them of the Turkish Military movements in the area saying &quot; “It was as if they already knew everything and didn&#x27;t need any additional information.” 

In 2022, it was revealed that the National Intelligence Service tapped the mobile phone of opposition politician Nikos Androulakis, which led to immediate resignation of Greece&#x27;s intelligence chief and the head of his personal office.

In 2023 the Agency introduced a Cybersecurity Center. The new Security Operation Center (SOC) will operate in EYP’s Cyberspace Directorate and will be in charge of monitoring, detecting and responding to cyber threats and security breaches of the country’s governmental digital infrastructure. 

==Other information==
The agency&#x27;s motto is the ancient Greek phrase &quot;&quot; (translated roughly as &quot;Do not discuss confidential affairs&quot;), a quote attributed to the Corinthian tyrant and philosopher Periander.

EYP is rumored to operate one of the largest criminal databases of any intelligence agency. In addition, it possesses a large volume of classified information about criminal hubs, activities and organizations operating throughout the European Union.

<text>Ronald Joseph Goulart (; (January 13, 1933 – January 14, 2022) was an American popular culture historian and mystery, fantasy and science fiction author.

He worked on novels and novelizations (and other works) being published under various pseudonyms such as: [[Kenneth Robeson]], Con Steffanson, Chad Calhoun, R. T. Edwards, Ian R. Jamieson, Josephine Kains, Jillian Kearny, Howard Lee, Zeke Masters, Frank S. Shawn, and Joseph Silva.

==Life and career==
Goulart was born in Berkeley, California, on January 13, 1933. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, and worked there as an advertising copywriter in San Francisco while he started to write fiction.

Goulart&#x27;s first professional publication was a 1952 reprint of the science fiction story &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;; this parody of a pulp magazine letters column was originally published in the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Pelican&quot;. His early career in advertising and marketing, influenced most of his work. In the early 1960s, Goulart wrote the text for &quot;Chex Press&quot;, a newspaper parody published on Ralston Purina cereal boxes (Wheat Chex, Rice Chex, Corn Chex). He then wrote dozens of novels and countless short stories spanning many genres, using a variety of pennames He contributed to &quot;P.S.&quot; and other magazines, along with his book review column for &quot;Venture Science Fiction Magazine&quot;. &quot;Cheap Thrills: An Informal History of the Pulp Magazines&quot; (1972) is his best known non-fiction book.

===Fiction===

Goulart&#x27;s fiction is characterized by several themes, including technology gone wrong (usually through incompetence rather than malice) and protagonists with superhuman powers. The characteristic style of his work is satire and anarchic humor. His crime and science fiction works include tales about robots and historical Hollywood figures, such as Groucho Marx. In the 1970s, he wrote several novels based on Lee Falk&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom&quot; for Avon Books, using the pseudonym &quot;Frank Shawn&quot; (a play on his wife and son&#x27;s names). He has also written comic book stories and short stories about The Phantom for Moonstone Books from 2003 to the present. As a commercial freelance writer, Goulart has written novelizations for television programs such as &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, as well as romance novels using female pseudonyms.

It is widely known that Goulart ghost wrote the &quot;TekWar&quot; series of books credited to the actor William Shatner (Shatner is said to have written the outlines for the books). He has also ghosted novels featuring the Phantom, Flash Gordon and the pulp character The Avenger.

A collection of his mystery short stories, &quot;Adam and Eve on a Raft&quot;, was published in 2001 by Crippen &amp; Landru.

===Comics===
In the early 1970s, Goulart wrote several scripts for Marvel Comics, mostly adaptations of classic science fiction stories. Later in the decade, he collaborated with artist Gil Kane on the &quot;Star Hawks&quot; newspaper strip. In the early 1990s, he scripted Marvel&#x27;s &quot;TekWar&quot; comics series.

===Personal life===
Goulart was married to author Frances Sheridan Goulart and has two sons, Sean-Lucien and Steffan Eamon. He died from respiratory arrest at a nursing home in Ridgefield, Connecticut, on January 14, 2022, one day after his 89th birthday.

==Awards==
Goulart was nominated twice for the Edgar Award, once for his 1970 science fiction novel &quot;After Things Fell Apart&quot;. He was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1989.

<text>Tom Godwin (June 6, 1915 – August 31, 1980) was an American science fiction author active throughout the 1950s into the 1970s. In his career, Godwin published three novels and around thirty short stories. He is best known for his short story, &quot;The Cold Equations&quot;. Published in 1954, the short story was Godwin’s fourth work to be published and was one whose controversial dark ending helped redefine the genre.

==Early life and education==

Godwin was born in Maryland in 1915. He had a rough childhood that was marked by much loss and suffering. At the age of five, his younger sister died as a result of an accidental shooting that occurred after he had been &quot;playing with the gun that killed her&quot;. After his mother&#x27;s death, he was raised by his father, with whom he did not have the best relationship. He withdrew from school after the third grade, but he went on to teach himself multiple other subjects to expand his knowledge and be able to write better stories.

==Personal life==
Godwin had a spinal disorder known as kyphosis, which results in a curvature of the spine, making him appear hunchbacked. He spent a few months in the Army before he was discharged due to his spinal condition worsening.

In the early 1960s, Godwin was living in a remote area of northwestern Arizona with his father while writing and making his own drywashers to sell. It was in the summer of 1961 that he met his future wife, Laureola Godwin, and his then twelve-year-old step-daughter, whom he later adopted, Diane Godwin Sullivan, through the sale of one of his drywashers. He went on to base two of the main characters in his second novel, &quot;The Space Barbarians&quot;, after them.

He worked for the forest service in Washington state for a short period of time. His wife died from a heart attack in the early 1970s. This was something that had a heavy impact on him for the rest of his life. After living with his adopted daughter and her family in Texas for some time after his wife&#x27;s death, he moved to Nevada.

==Death==

Throughout his life, Godwin battled with alcohol abuse with varying degrees of success in being able to control it. It was his wife&#x27;s death that eventually led him to be &quot;consume[d]&quot; by drinking which led to many health problems. Godwin died in a Las Vegas hospital in the summer of 1980. He did not have any identification on him so his body was held at a funeral home until a friend of his who was a physician assistant learned of his death and contacted his daughter, Diane.

<text>Herefordshire ( ) is a ceremonial county in the West Midlands of England, bordered by Shropshire to the north, Worcestershire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south-east, and the Welsh counties of Monmouthshire and Powys to the west. The city of Hereford is the largest settlement and county town.

The county is one of the most rural in England, with an area of and a population of 187,034, giving a density of 88/km2 (228/sq mi). After Hereford (53,112) the largest settlements are Leominster (10,938), Ross-on-Wye (10,582), and Ledbury (8,862). For local government purposes Herefordshire is a unitary authority area.

The centre of Herefordshire is lowland which is crossed by the River Wye and its tributary, the Lugg. To the east are the Malvern Hills, a national landscape, which straddle the boundary with Worcestershire. The south of the county contains the northern part of the Wye Valley, also a national landscape, which stretches into Wales. In the west, the ground rises to the Black Mountains range; this contains the Black Mountain (), which lies on the Powys border and is the highest point in the county, at .

The county is in the historic Welsh Marches. The land use is mostly agricultural, and the county is known for its fruit and cider production, and for the Hereford cattle breed.

==Physical geography==

The River Wye, which at is the fourth-longest in the United Kingdom, enters the county after briefly being its border with Powys. It flows through both Hereford and Ross-on-Wye before returning to Wales. Leominster is on the River Lugg, a tributary of the Wye.

There are two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the county. The Wye Valley is in the river&#x27;s valleys south of Hereford, while the Malvern Hills are in the east of the county, along its border with Worcestershire.

==History==
Herefordshire is one of the 39 historic counties of England. Herefordshire County Council was created in 1889.

In 1974, the administrative county formed in 1889 was merged with that of neighbouring Worcestershire to form Hereford and Worcester. Within this, Herefordshire was covered by the local government districts of South Herefordshire, Hereford, and part of Malvern Hills and Leominster districts. However, the county was dissolved in 1998, resulting in the return of Herefordshire and Worcestershire as counties.

The county and unitary authority created in 1998 has almost identical borders to the pre-1974 county; a small area at Park Wood had been transferred from Mathon to West Malvern in 1986 and so went to Worcestershire rather than Herefordshire in 1998, but otherwise the re-established border between the two counties was identical to the pre-1974 boundary.

==Constitution==
From 1974 to 1998, Herefordshire was part of the former non-metropolitan county of Hereford and Worcester.

Herefordshire was reconstituted both as a new district as &quot;County of Herefordshire&quot; and as a new county (coextensive with the area of the aforementioned district) (effective 1 April 1998) by Statutory Instrument as defined in &quot;The Hereford and Worcester (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996&quot;. This Order established Herefordshire as a unitary authority on 1 April 1998, combining county and district functions into a single council. Herefordshire is also commonly called a &quot;unitary district&quot;, but this is not official nomenclature. Herefordshire is officially known as a unitary authority for local government purposes. It is governed by Herefordshire Council which was created in 1998 with the new unitary district that absorbed the previous administrative areas of Hereford City Council, South Herefordshire District Council, most of Leominster District Council, and part of Malvern Hills District Council, all within the previous non-metropolitan county of Hereford and Worcester, whose functions the new authority inherited within its area. The remainder of Malvern Hills district absorbed the Worcestershire part of Leominster district (the area around Tenbury Wells) and continued to constitute a (smaller) district within the new two-tier county of Worcestershire.

The Lieutenancies Act 1997 made Herefordshire a ceremonial county, covering the exact area of the unitary district. For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG11) and is one of three counties that comprise the &quot;Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire&quot; NUTS 2 region.

==Demographics==

In Herefordshire, the population size has increased by 2.0%, from around 183,500 in 2011 to 187,100 in 2021. This is lower than the overall increase for England (6.6%), where the population grew by nearly 3.5 million to 56,489,800.

As of the 2021 census, 91.1% of the population identified as &#x27;White British&#x27;, and 5.1% as &#x27;White Other&#x27;. The &#x27;White Other&#x27; group is largely made up of migrants from central and Eastern Europe who began moving into the county in the early 2000&#x27;s, initially for agricultural work, but more recently to work in other sectors such as health care, catering and hospitality. Poland and Romania are the two most common non-UK countries of birth for foreign born people in Herefordshire.

Christianity is the dominant religion in Herefordshire at 54.9% of the population as of 2021 (a decline from 67.8% at the 2011 census). Muslims make up 0.4% of the population, Buddhists 0.3% and Hindus 0.2%.

===Travellers===
Gypsies and Travellers have historically been Herefordshire&#x27;s largest minority ethnic group. They are made up of three main groups:
* Romanichal or Romani
* Irish Travellers
*New Travellers or New Age Travellers

As of the 2021 census, they number 600 people, at around 0.2% of the county&#x27;s population.

Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers fall within the definition of a minority ethnic group under the Race Relations Amendment Act (2000). There were approximately 400 people (0.2%) within this minority group in the county at the 2011 Census.

==Economy==
Bulmers Cider in Hereford is the world&#x27;s largest cider factory, and has the world&#x27;s largest vat (for Strongbow), built in 1975. Painter Brothers (part of Balfour Beatty) in the north of Hereford, is the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of electricity pylons (transmission towers), broadcasting masts, the Callender-Hamilton bridge, and rail electrification structures. Special Metals Wiggin, part of Special Metals Corporation, based at Hereford was the main producer of nickel alloys in Europe, with a large site directly north of Painter Brothers. Cargill Meats Europe (formerly Sun Valley) have a large poultry meat processing facility, processing chickens from around Herefordshire.

Cadbury (Mondelēz International) make milk chocolate crumb near Marlbrook (near Leominster). Weston&#x27;s Cider is in Much Marcle, who also make Stowford Press. Wye Fruit Ltd is in the north of Ledbury on the B4214 and is a large site of Amcor, and further west is Universal Beverages (UBL), owned by Heineken since 2007 where it cans cider. The site of Ledbury Preserves of RHM made Robertson&#x27;s jam, mincemeat and marmalade and closed in 2008 when production moved to Cambridgeshire. Holden Aluminium Technologies are a sports car chassis manufacturer at Linton. Kingspan Insulation is based at Pembridge. BT&#x27;s Madley Communications Centre, claims to be the world&#x27;s largest earth station. Tyrrells Potato Crisps are at Dilwyn west of Leominster.

Many well-known cider producers are based in Herefordshire. These include Weston&#x27;s cider of Much Marcle, and Bulmer&#x27;s cider, from Hereford, which produces the UK market leader Strongbow.

==Cities, towns and villages==

The major settlements in the county include Hereford, which is the county town and Herefordshire&#x27;s only city, as well as the towns of Leominster, Ledbury, Ross-on-Wye, Kington and Bromyard.

==Employment==
Most employment in Herefordshire is in agriculture, manufacturing and services. According to Herefordshire Council&#x27;s online document &quot;worklessness&quot;, 10% of people are unemployed in Herefordshire including out-of-work, homeless, ill and disabled and their carers. Cargill Meats and H. P. Bulmers are two of the largest private sector employers, with the Council and NHS being the largest public sector employers.

==Politics==

===Westminster Parliamentary===

There are two parliamentary constituencies in Herefordshire. , Ellie Chowns, a member of the Green Party, represents North Herefordshire and Jesse Norman, a member of the Conservative Party, represents Hereford and South Herefordshire.

===Council===
The council operates a cabinet-style council and has been independently controlled since 2019. The chairman is Sebastian Bowen and the leader of the council is David Hitchiner.

The cabinet leader is appointed yearly by the full council of 53 councillors. The cabinet leader then picks their deputy and up to eight other councillors to form the executive cabinet. Each cabinet member makes the decisions about the portfolio that they are allocated. Elections to the council are held every four years. Elections are conducted under the FPTP system with the 53 wards returning one councillor each. Elections have been held in 2000, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019, with the next election due in 2023.

In the 2019 election, the Conservatives lost control of Herefordshire Council.

==Education==

Herefordshire has a comprehensive education system that also includes several independent schools. Most state secondary schools are for ages 11–16. Providers of further and higher education in the county include Hereford College of Arts, Hereford College of Education, Hereford Sixth Form College, Herefordshire and Ludlow College, Royal National College for the Blind, NMITE and Herefordshire and Worcestershire Group Training Association (HWGTA).

==Agriculture==
The agricultural economy has changed greatly in recent years within the county. The county is on the western edge of England which has been historically pastoral as opposed to the east which was more arable.

===Beef===
Probably Hereford&#x27;s most famous export is its Hereford beef cattle. Herefords are docile but extremely hardy creatures and these attributes have led to their proliferation across the world, particularly the US, Canada, South America and Australia. The breed is so gentle that a Hereford bull was used as the mascot for Hereford United Football Club for many years, led around the club&#x27;s Edgar Street ground before major matches.

===Fruit===

The county is famous for its apple and pear orchards, and its cider. There are many orchards around the county but not as many as there once were.

In the last few years, soft fruits such as strawberries have become a new and rapidly expanding area of the agricultural economy of the county. One of the main reasons for this was the introduction of the polytunnel or French tunnel. This allows the strawberries to be grown for a far longer season and with a higher quality (with no blemishes from the rain). The strawberries are mainly picked by Eastern European workers who come over for the season and often earn more money than they could working in their own country and with the bonus, for many of them, of learning or improving their English. The polytunnels have been a major issue in the county, as some people see them as a &quot;blot on the landscape&quot;.

Although some polytunnel sites are illegal, Herefordshire Council has turned a blind eye in the belief that agriculture must be allowed to innovate; otherwise it will stagnate and the county will suffer.

===Dairy===
Previously, most farms in the county had dairy cattle. Due to the cost of investing in new equipment, long hours, BSE, foot-and-mouth disease and mainly falling milk prices, the county&#x27;s milk production has drastically reduced, with only a few farms still in dairy farming.

===Potatoes===
The county is historically pastoral. The soils are mostly clay, meaning that large scale potato production was very difficult, as tractors were not powerful enough to pull the large machinery required to harvest the crop. Around the early 1990s new technology and more powerful machines overcame this problem. Potato production started to increase, fuelled by a few other key factors: The previously pastoral soils had not had potatoes grown in them; consequently they were not infected with eelworm (&quot;Heterodera rostochiensis&quot; and &quot;Heterodera pallida&quot;), which in the east of England had to be sprayed against weekly (a large cost). Also, the clay soil produced an unblemished potato of the highest grade.

The intensive nature of the crop meant that potatoes could be grown viably on a given field in only one of every five years. Because potato growers always needed more land than they owned, they rented extra. This demand for rental fields came at a time when the rest of the industry was struggling and in serious decline. The potato farmers&#x27; rents of £300–500 per acre (as opposed to normally £80 per acre) were very helpful to many farmers in a difficult period.

==Emblems==
===Coat of arms===
Herefordshire County Council was granted a coat of arms on 28 February 1946. The arms became obsolete in 1974 on the abolition of the council, but were transferred to the present Herefordshire Council by Order in Council in 1997.

The arms are blazoned as follows:

&quot;Gules on a fesse wavy between in chief a lion passant guardant argent and in base a Herefordshire bull&#x27;s head caboshed proper, a bar wavy azure; and for a Crest on a wreath of the colours a demi lion rampant gules holding in the sinister claw a fleece or; and for Supporters, on the dexter side a lion guardant or gorged with a wreath of hops fructed proper and on the sinister a talbot argent gorged with a collar or charged with three apples proper.&quot;

The red colouring (&quot;gules&quot;) of the shield is taken from the arms of the City of Hereford. The red colour also represents the red earth of Herefordshire. The silver and blue wave across the centre of the shield represents the River Wye. The lions that form parts of the arms, crest and supporters are also taken from Hereford&#x27;s arms. The agricultural produce of Herefordshire is represented by the bull&#x27;s head, fleece, hops and apples. The talbot dog comes from the heraldry of the Talbot family, Marcher Lords of Shrewsbury and also from that of Viscount Hereford.

The Latin motto is: &quot;Pulchra terra Dei donum&quot; (&quot;This fair land is the gift of God&quot;).

===County flower===
As part of a competition organised by the charity Plantlife to raise awareness of conservation issues, the public were asked to vote for &quot;county flowers&quot; that they felt best represented their county. Mistletoe was announced as the winning choice for Herefordshire in 2004. The emblem has no official status and has not been widely adopted. Herefordshire Council uses a logo consisting of a green apple.

==Media==
===Television===
The county is covered by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central from its studios in Birmingham. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill TV transmitter located 8.5 miles south east of Hereford.

===Radio===
BBC Local Radio the for county is served by BBC Hereford and Worcester which broadcast from Worcester but also has another studio in Hereford. County-wide radio stations are Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, Sunshine Radio, Radio Wyvern, Capital Mid-Counties, and Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire.

==Sport==

Perhaps the most famous sporting team in Herefordshire is Hereford United football club, founded in 1924, who were members of the Football League and played at Edgar Street stadium in the city of Hereford. The club then made its way upwards to the Southern Football League, finally gaining election to the Football League in 1972 and defeating Newcastle United in an FA Cup tie. Two successive promotions saw the club reach the Second Division in 1978, but two successive relegations followed and saw the club side back into the Fourth Division. The club was relegated in 1997 to the Football Conference, not regaining its Football League status until 2006. The club then played in Football League Two – the fourth tier of English football – for six years before once again being relegated out of the Football League at the end of the 2011–12 season. The club was wound up in 2014. A new phoenix club, Hereford F.C. was set up competing in the Midland Football League Premier Division (9th tier) for its first season, 2015–16.

Cricket is widely played within the county, and Herefordshire County Cricket Club compete in the Minor Counties Championship, having been elected in 1992 to take Durham&#x27;s place, when that county joined the First-class structure.

==Transport==

===Road===

The M50, one of the first motorways to be built in the United Kingdom, runs through the south of the county and, with the A40 dual carriageway, forms part of the major route linking South Wales with the West Midlands and the north of England. The A49 runs north–south through the county and is a strategic route between North and South Wales as well as catering for local traffic.

===Railways===
The Welsh Marches Line also runs north–south with passenger trains operated by Transport for Wales offering links to Manchester as well as to North and South Wales. Hereford is the western end of the Cotswold Line which runs via Worcester with through services to Oxford and London Paddington (operated by Great Western Railway) and to Birmingham (operated by West Midlands Trains). The rural Heart of Wales Line linking Craven Arms in Shropshire to Llanelli in southwest Wales passes through the extreme north west of Herefordshire with stations at Knighton and Bucknell near the meeting point of the boundaries of Herefordshire, Shropshire and Powys. The majority of passengers between North and South Wales use the Marches line.

Former lines which are now closed were the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway; Ross &amp; Monmouth Railway; Hereford to Hay-on-Wye; Pontrilas to Hay-on-Wye; Hay-on-Wye to Brecon; Leominster to New Radnor; Eardisley to Presteigne; and Leominster to Worcester via Bromyard. Part of the Titley Spur is opened annually by enthusiasts and a steam train is run along the track.

There has long been talk of a new station at Rotherwas, in the south of Hereford.
===Air===
There are no airports with scheduled air transport in Herefordshire. Birmingham Airport, Cardiff Airport and Bristol Airport are the nearest. The RailAir RailAir coach operated by First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley provides connections to Heathrow Airport via Reading station or passengers can change at Reading station and then go all the way by train via Hayes &amp; Harlington to Heathrow Airport. Shobdon Aerodrome near Leominster is a centre for general aviation and gliding. Hot air ballooning is also popular with Eastnor Castle being one of the favourite launch sites in the area.

===Waterways===
Historically, the rivers Wye, Teme and Lugg were navigable but the wide seasonal variations in water levels mean that few craft larger than canoes and coracles are now used. There are canoe centres at Wye Valley Canoes, Glasbury-on-Wye (in Powys, Wales), the Hereford Youth Service and Kerne Bridge in Ross-on-Wye, as well as rowing clubs in Hereford and Ross-on-Wye.

The early 19th century saw the construction of two canals, The Herefordshire &amp; Gloucestershire Canal and The Leominster &amp; Stourport Canal but these were never successful and there are now few remains to be seen. The Herefordshire &amp; Gloucestershire Canal is currently the subject a restoration project, which includes the construction of a new canal basin in Hereford city centre as part of the regeneration of the Edgar Street Grid. The project, however, is being undertaken by a small voluntary group and there is no expected date for any part of the canal to re-open for boating.

He left college after one year and travelled in Europe, living a drifter&#x27;s existence, working a multitude of jobs around the world in the years leading up to World War II.

==Career==
Gallun wrote his first two stories, &quot;The Space Dwellers&quot; and &quot;The Crystal Ray&quot; (both published in 1929), at age 16. He was among the stalwart group of early sci-fi pulp writers who popularized the genre. He sold many popular stories to pulp magazines in the 1930s. &quot;Old Faithful&quot; (1934) was his first noted story. &quot;The Gentle Brain&quot; was published in &quot;Science Fiction Quarterly&quot; under the pseudonym Arthur Allport.

His first book, &quot;People Minus X&quot;, was published in 1957 by Simon &amp; Schuster, followed by &quot;The Planet Strappers &quot;in 1961 (Pyramid). The Ballantine collection issued in 1978, &quot;The Best of Raymond Z. Gallun&quot;, provides a selection of his early work. Gallun was honored with the I-CON Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985 at I-CON IV; the award was later renamed The Raymond Z. Gallun Award.

His pen names include Dow Elstar, E.V. Raymond, William Callahan, and Arthur Allport.
==Death and posthumous work==
Gallun died of a heart attack at his home in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens, New York, on April 2, 1994.

A posthumous autobiography, &quot;Starclimber&quot;, authored in part by Gallun and completed by Jeffrey M. Elliot, was published in September 2007. There is an extensive interview with Gallun about his life and career in Eric Leif Davin&#x27;s &quot;Pioneers of Wonder&quot;.

In 2017, a mural honoring Gallun was painted in his hometown of Beaver Dam by an organization of sign and mural artists known as &quot;Walldogs.&quot;

<doc id="399839" wikidata="Q152549" url="?curid=399839" title="Maria Theresa of Spain">
<text>Maria Theresa of Spain (; ; 10 September 1638 – 30 July 1683) was Queen of France from 1660 to 1683 as the wife of King Louis XIV. She was born an Infanta of Spain and Portugal as the daughter of King Philip IV and Elisabeth of France, and was also an Archduchess of Austria as a member of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg.

Her marriage in 1660 to King Louis XIV, her double first cousin, was arranged with the purpose of ending the lengthy war between France and Spain. Famed for her virtue and piety, she saw five of her six children die in early childhood, and is frequently viewed as an object of pity in historical accounts of her husband&#x27;s reign, since she was often neglected by the court and overshadowed by the King&#x27;s many mistresses.

Without any political influence in the French court or government (except briefly in 1672, when she was named regent during her husband&#x27;s absence during the Franco-Dutch War), she died aged 44 due to complications from an abscess on her arm. Her grandson Philip V inherited the Spanish throne in 1700 after the death of her younger half-brother, Charles II. The resulting War of the Spanish Succession established the House of Bourbon as the new ruling dynasty of Spain, where it has reigned with some interruption until the present time.

==Biography==
===Birth and early life===

Born at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial, the Infanta Maria Theresa was the daughter of Philip IV &amp; III and his first wife Elisabeth of France. She was named after Sainte Thérèse, who Elisabeth chose to protect her daughter. As a member of the House of Austria, Maria Theresa was entitled to use the title Archduchess of Austria. She was known in Spain as María Teresa de Austria and in France as Marie-Thérèse d&#x27;Autriche.

Maria Theresa was raised by the royal governess Luisa Magdalena de Jesus. Her religious education was first carried out by Juan de Palma. Later, Father Vasquez, a man recognised in Spain for being highly educated and of great virtue, was entrusted with the spiritual education of the young Infanta. Elisabeth of France died when Maria Theresa was six years old. The Infanta was very close to her step-mother, Mariana of Austria, who was only five years her senior.

Unlike France, Spain had no Salic Law, so it was possible for a female to assume the throne. When Maria Theresa&#x27;s brother Balthasar Charles died in 1646, she became heir presumptive to the vast Spanish Empire and remained such until the birth of her brother Philip Prospero, in 1657. She was briefly heir presumptive once more between 1 and 6 November 1661, following the death of Prince Philip and until the birth of Prince Charles, who would later inherit the thrones of Spain as Charles II.

===Betrothal and proxy marriage===
In 1658, as war with France began to wind down, a union between the royal families of Spain and France was proposed as a means to secure peace. Maria Theresa and the French king were double first cousins: Louis XIV&#x27;s father was Louis XIII, who was the brother of Maria Theresa&#x27;s mother, while her father was brother to Anne of Austria, Louis XIV&#x27;s mother. Spanish procrastination led to a scheme in which France&#x27;s chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, pretended to seek a marriage for his master with Margaret Yolande of Savoy. When Philip IV of Spain heard of a meeting at Lyon between the Houses of France and Savoy in November 1658, he reputedly exclaimed of the Franco-Savoyard union that &quot;it cannot be, and will not be&quot;. Philip then sent a special envoy to the French court to open negotiations for peace and a royal marriage.

The negotiations for the marriage contract were intense. Eager to prevent a union of the two countries or crowns, especially one in which Spain would be subservient to France, the diplomats sought to include a renunciation clause that would deprive Maria Theresa and her children of any rights to the Spanish succession. A marriage contract was eventually arranged in November 1659 as one of the provisions of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. The contract specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants. Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 écus. As it turned out, Spain, impoverished and bankrupt after decades of war, was unable to pay such a dowry, and France never received the agreed upon sum.

On 2 June 1660, Maria Theresa was married by proxy to Louis at Fuenterrabia. Luis Méndez de Haro acted as bridegroom.
===Marriage===
Philip IV and the entire Spanish court accompanied the bride to the Isle of Pheasants on the border in the Bidassoa river, where Louis and his court met her in the meeting on the Isle of Pheasants on 7 June 1660, and she entered France. On 9 June the marriage took place in Saint-Jean-de-Luz at the recently rebuilt church of Saint Jean the Baptist. After the wedding, Louis wanted to consummate the marriage as quickly as possible.

===Queen of France===

On 26 August 1660, the newlyweds made the traditional Joyous Entry into Paris. Louis was highly affectionate and attentive to the new Queen, commanding the &quot;Grand Maréchal du Logis&quot; that &quot;the Queen and himself were never to be set apart, no matter how small the house in which they might be lodging&quot;. However, his devotion was short-lived and he promptly began pursuing Louise de La Vallière.

Maria Theresa became pregnant for the first time in early 1661. She gave birth to the long-awaited Dauphin on 1 November 1661, fulfilling her primary duty as Queen. Louis stayed by her side during the difficult birth and exhibited immense care and support but returned to his mistress, La Valliere, shortly after.

Maria Theresa had trouble adjusting to life at the French court, often struggling to understand French pleasures and humor. She clung to her aunt, the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria, whom she affectionately referred to as “tia”. Religiously devout, Maria Theresa enjoyed long masses and the celebration of traditional Spanish fêtes. Outside of praying, she spent much of her free time playing cards and gambling. Maria Theresa played little part in political affairs, although she briefly acted as regent in 1667 while her husband was away on campaigns on the frontier. 

Louis initially attempted to keep his constant infidelity hidden, but became more overt as time progressed. Maria Theresa despised her husband&#x27;s prolonged infidelity with Françoise-Athénaïs, Marquise de Montespan. Louis reprimanded Madame de Montespan when her behaviour at court too flagrantly disrespected the queen&#x27;s position, yet often displayed a level of indulgence toward her that surpassed his treatment of the queen.

Later, the governess of Montespan&#x27;s illegitimate children by the king, Madame de Maintenon, came to supplant her mistress in the king&#x27;s affections. At first she resisted the king&#x27;s advances and encouraged him to bestow more attention on his long-neglected wife, a thoughtfulness which Maria Theresa repaid with warmth toward the new favourite. After the queen&#x27;s death, Maintenon would become the king&#x27;s second, although officially secret, wife.

There were rumours that Maria Theresa had an illegitimate daughter, Louise Marie Thérèse (The Black Nun of Moret).

===Death===
In July 1683, Maria Theresa developed an abscess in her armpit that gave rise to a fever. Her physician, Guy-Crescent Fagon, insisted on bleeding her despite objections. She died a painful death on 30 July 1683. Upon her death, Louis XIV said: &quot;This is the first chagrin she has ever given me.&quot; For the grand funeral ceremony, Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed dramatic motets H.409, H.189, H.331 and Jean-Baptiste Lully his &quot;Dies irae.&quot; The funeral prayer was by Bossuet.

==Issue==
Maria Theresa married her double first cousin Louis XIV in 1660. The couple had six children, only one of whom survived to adulthood:

#Louis, Grand Dauphin (1 November 1661 – 14 April 1711) married Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, had issue.
#Anne-Élisabeth (18 November 1662 – 30 December 1662); died in infancy.
#Marie-Anne (16 November 1664 – 26 December 1664); died in infancy.
#Marie Thérèse (2 January 1667 – 1 March 1672); styled as &quot;Madame Royale&quot;, died at the age of five.
#Philippe Charles (5 August 1668 – 10 July 1671); styled as Duke of Anjou, died at the age of two.
#Louis François (14 June 1672 – 4 November 1672); styled Duke of Anjou, died in infancy.

Of her six children, only one survived her, Louis, &quot;&quot;, the oldest one, who died in 1711. One of her younger grandsons eventually inherited her claim to the Spanish throne to become King Philip V of Spain in 1700.

<doc id="399843" wikidata="Q1229610" url="?curid=399843" title="Distributed shared memory">
<text>In computer science, distributed shared memory (DSM) is a form of memory architecture where physically separated memories can be addressed as a single shared address space. The term &quot;shared&quot; does not mean that there is a single centralized memory, but that the address space is shared—i.e., the same physical address on two processors refers to the same location in memory. Distributed global address space (DGAS), is a similar term for a wide class of software and hardware implementations, in which each node of a cluster has access to shared memory in addition to each node&#x27;s private (i.e., not shared) memory.

== Overview ==

A distributed-memory system, often called a multicomputer, consists of multiple independent processing nodes with local memory modules which is connected by a general interconnection network. Software DSM systems can be implemented in an operating system, or as a programming library and can be thought of as extensions of the underlying virtual memory architecture. When implemented in the operating system, such systems are transparent to the developer; which means that the underlying distributed memory is completely hidden from the users. In contrast, software DSM systems implemented at the library or language level are not transparent and developers usually have to program them differently. However, these systems offer a more portable approach to DSM system implementations. A DSM system implements the shared-memory model on a physically distributed memory system.
DSM can be achieved via software as well as hardware. Hardware examples include cache coherence circuits and network interface controllers. There are three ways of implementing DSM:
* Page-based approach using virtual memory
* Shared-variable approach using routines to access shared variables
* Object-based approach, ideally accessing shared data through object-oriented discipline

===Advantages===
* Scales well with a large number of nodes
* Message passing is hidden 
* Can handle complex and large databases without replication or sending the data to processes
* Generally cheaper than using a multiprocessor system
* Provides large virtual memory space
* Programs are more portable due to common programming interfaces
* Shield programmers from sending or receiving primitives

===Disadvantages===
* Generally slower to access than non-distributed shared memory
* Must provide additional protection against simultaneous accesses to shared data
* May incur a performance penalty
* Little programmer control over actual messages being generated
* Programmers need to understand consistency models to write correct programs

===Comparison with message passing ===
Software DSM systems also have the flexibility to organize the shared memory region in different ways. The page based approach organizes shared memory into pages of fixed size. In contrast, the object based approach organizes the shared memory region as an abstract space for storing shareable objects of variable sizes. Another commonly seen implementation uses a tuple space, in which the unit of sharing is a tuple.

Shared memory architecture may involve separating memory into shared parts distributed amongst nodes and main memory; or distributing all memory between nodes. A coherence protocol, chosen in accordance with a consistency model, maintains memory coherence.
==Directory memory coherence==

Memory coherence is necessary such that the system which organizes the DSM is able to track and maintain the state of data blocks in nodes across the memories comprising the system. A directory is one such mechanism which maintains the state of cache blocks moving around the system.

=== States ===
A basic DSM will track at least three states among nodes for any given block in the directory. There will be some state to dictate the block as uncached (U), a state to dictate a block as exclusively owned or modified owned (EM), and a state to dictate a block as shared (S). As blocks come into the directory organization, they will transition from U to EM (ownership state) in the initial node. The state can transition to S when other nodes begin reading the block.

There are two primary methods for allowing the system to track where blocks are cached and in what condition across each node. Home-centric request-response uses the home to service requests and drive states, whereas requester-centric allows each node to drive and manage its own requests through the home.

=== Home-centric request and response ===
In a home-centric system, the DSM will avoid having to handle request-response races between nodes by allowing only one transaction to occur at a time until the home node has decided that the transaction is finished—usually when the home has received every responding processor&#x27;s response to the request. An example of this is Intel&#x27;s QPI home-source mode. The advantages of this approach are that it&#x27;s simple to implement but its request-response strategy is slow and buffered due to the home node&#x27;s limitations.

=== Requester-centric request and response ===
In a requester-centric system, the DSM will allow nodes to talk at will to each other through the home. This means that multiple nodes can attempt to start a transaction, but this requires additional considerations to ensure coherence. For example: when one node is processing a block, if it receives a request for that block from another node it will send a NAck (Negative Acknowledgement) to tell the initiator that the processing node can&#x27;t fulfill that request right away. An example of this is Intel&#x27;s QPI snoop-source mode. This approach is fast but it does not naturally prevent race conditions and generates more bus traffic.

== Consistency models ==
The DSM must follow certain rules to maintain consistency over how read and write order is viewed among nodes, called the system&#x27;s &quot;consistency model&quot;.

Suppose we have &quot;n&quot; processes and &quot;Mi&quot; memory operations for each process &quot;i&quot;, and that all the operations are executed sequentially. We can conclude that (&quot;M1&quot; + &quot;M2&quot; + ... + &quot;Mn&quot;)!/(&quot;M1&quot;! &quot;M2&quot;!... &quot;Mn&quot;!) are possible interleavings of the operations. The issue with this conclusion is determining the correctness of the interleaved operations. Memory coherence for DSM defines which interleavings are permitted.

==Replication==
There are two types of replication Algorithms. Read replication and Write replication. 
In Read replication multiple nodes can read at the same time but only one node can write. 
In Write replication multiple nodes can read and write at the same time. The write requests 
are handled by a sequencer. 
Replication of shared data in general tends to:
* Reduce network traffic
* Promote increased parallelism 
* Result in fewer page faults
However, preserving coherence and consistency may become more challenging.

==Release and entry consistency==
* Release consistency: when a process exits a critical section, new values of the variables are propagated to all sites.
* Entry consistency: when a process enters a critical section, it will automatically update the values of the shared variables.
** View-based Consistency: it is a variant of Entry Consistency, except the shared variables of a critical section are automatically detected by the system. An implementation of view-based consistency is VODCA which has comparable performance to MPI on cluster computers.

<text>Johann Reinhold Forster (22 October 1729 – 9 December 1798) was a German Reformed pastor and naturalist.

Born in Dirschau, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (now Tczew, Poland), he attended school in Dirschau and Marienwerder before being admitted at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in Berlin in 1745. Skilled in classical and biblical languages, he studied theology at the University of Halle. In 1753, he became a parson at a parish just south of Danzig. He married his cousin Justina Elisabeth Nicolai in 1754, and they had seven children; the oldest child was George Forster, also known as Georg. 

In 1765, Forster was commissioned by the Russian government to inspect the new colonies on the Volga. Accompanied by George on the journey, he observed the conditions of the colonists and made scientific observations that were later read at the Russian Academy of Sciences. After making a report that was critical of the Russian administration, Forster left for England without payment in 1766. In England, Forster became the successor of Joseph Priestley as tutor in modern languages and natural history at Warrington Academy where he worked for two years. He made contact with many other naturalists, published a textbook on mineralogy and translated works of the apostles of Linnaeus into English. Invited by the geographer Alexander Dalrymple, Forster moved to London in 1770 in preparation for participation in an East India Company expedition, but the plans fell through and Forster continued to publish translations as well as scientific works including contributions to North American zoology and botany. In February 1772, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. 

After the withdrawal of Joseph Banks from the second voyage of James Cook, Forster accepted the position of naturalist on board of Cook&#x27;s ship, where he was accompanied by his son George as draughtsman and assistant. On their three-year journey, they made the first recorded crossing of the Antarctic Circle and made observations and discoveries in New Zealand and Polynesia. When they had returned to England, Forster published the botanical work &quot;Characteres generum plantarum&quot;. However, there was disagreement with Cook on who should write a narrative of the journey. After a lengthy argument, George wrote &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;, which appeared six weeks before Cook&#x27;s account. Forster separately published his scientific &quot;Observations Made During a Voyage Round the World&quot;. 

Forster&#x27;s pride and obstinacy caused him to fall out with many powerful men in England; after clearing some of his substantial debt with the aid of German patrons, he returned to Germany where he was professor at the University of Halle from 1780. He oversaw the university&#x27;s botanical garden for a few years and published in a wide range of sciences. Forster died in 1798 and is buried in Halle. He is commemorated in the names of various species of plants and animals, including the genera &quot;Forstera&quot; and &quot;Forsterygion&quot;. 

== Early life and education ==
Johann Reinhold Forster was born on 22 October 1729 in Dirschau, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (now Tczew, Poland). Forster&#x27;s family traced its origins to a Yorkshire-born ancestor called George Forster, a descendant of the Scottish Forrester family. This ancestor had emigrated from England after supporting the losing Royalist side in the English Civil War and had become a merchant in Neuenburg (Nowe) in the 1640s. Forster&#x27;s father was Georg Reinhold Forster and his mother was Eva Plaht, the daughter of Dirschau&#x27;s mayor Johann Wolff and the widow of Martin Plaht. Georg Reinhold became mayor of Dirschau in 1733 (as the third Forster in this position) but became an invalid in 1735 and had to retire as mayor. Forster attended a Latin school in Dirschau, and then went to Marienwerder (Kwidzyn) to attend the &quot;gymnasium&quot; in 1743. 
In May 1745, Forster was admitted at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in Berlin, a reputable institution. His teachers included , the school rector, who taught theology, Hebrew, Roman antiquity and philosophy; and , the school librarian, who taught history, literature, Latin and natural philosophy. Forster quickly became skilled in classical and biblical languages including Coptic and fluent in Latin. He graduated in 1748 together with , who became a lifelong friend. Other friends and acquaintances included Louis de Beausobre, and Carl Gottfried Woide. Forster also sought out the friendship of foreign students to improve his knowledge of modern languages, especially French. 

After his time at the gymnasium, Forster wanted to study medicine at the University of Halle. However, his father wanted him to study law instead. As a compromise, Forster studied theology in Halle. Little is known about his student days. His academic teachers included theologian Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten and orientalist . 

By July 1751, Forster had arrived in Danzig (Gdańsk), where he was a candidate for ordination at the Reformed church of . He had only a meagre income, and his preaching workload did not allow him to pursue his scholarly interests. His sermons won praise, and his superiors contemplated sending him abroad for additional training. Forster was ordained in Königsberg in August 1753 and (possibly to please his father) accepted the post of parson of the Hochzeit-Nassenhuben parish just south of Danzig, starting there on 23 September 1753.

== Marriage and work as pastor ==

Forster had courted his cousin Justina Elisabeth Nicolai since 1751. However, he was unable to marry her on his income at the time. His father died on 15 November 1753, not long after Forster obtained the post in Nassenhuben, and Forster sold the family house in Dirschau soon after, in 1754. He married Justina Elisabeth on 26 February 1754 at St Peter and Paul in Danzig. Between 1754 and 1765, they had seven children who survived childbirth, including the eldest son, Johann George Adam Forster, also known as Georg Forster. 

Forster started to spend some of his inheritance on his library, collecting thousands of books. He concentrated on scholarly work (especially Egyptian languages such as Coptic) to the detriment of his duties as a pastor. Sometimes he fell asleep during the church service only to be woken to deliver his sermon. Forster expected to move to a position in Danzig after the one in Nassenhuben, following existing precedent, but this did not materialise. In 1757, he wrote to the mathematician Leonhard Euler in an attempt to find a position at the new Imperial Moscow University; while he obtained a recommendation, nothing came of it because of the intensifying Seven Years&#x27; War. Russian troops occupied the area surrounding Danzig in May 1758, including the Hochzeit-Nassenhuben parish. Forster did not leave for the relative safety of Danzig, but stayed with his parishioners and protected them against excesses of the occupying Russian troops by directly making demands of the Russian commander-in-chief, William Fermor. 

Forster&#x27;s son George was interested in the study of nature from an early age, and so Reinhold, to satisfy his son&#x27;s curiosity, bought Carl Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and other books, learned natural history from them and then taught his son. Other subjects of this instruction were Latin, French and religion as well as writing and arithmetic.

== Russian expedition ==

In 1765, Forster obtained leave from his pastoral offices and travelled to St Petersburg with ten-year old George, their expenses paid by Hans Wilhelm Rehbinder, a Russian in Danzig who recommended them to Count Grigory Orlov, the favourite of Catherine the Great. Forster was given a commission to inspect the newly founded colonies near Saratov on the Volga River, with the expectation that his report should show that the Volga German colonists were thriving and happy and to dispel rumours to the contrary. Forster also made scientific plans for the journey, which the Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg supported by providing him with reference books and instruments. The Forsters travelled from Moscow to Saratov in May 1765, continuing via Dmitriyevsk (now Kamyshin) to Tsaritsyn (now Volgograd). They reached the Kalmyk Steppe and Lake Elton (where Forster studied the salt industry), and inspected further settlements along the Volga and some of its tributaries before returning to St Petersburg in October. During the journey, George collected hundreds of plant specimens, helping his father with naming and identification. 

Forster lived made contact with other scientists, and his scientific observations from the journey were read in several sessions of the Academy of Sciences, introduced by the geologist Johann Gottlieb Lehmann. His report for the Russian government was critical of the conditions for the colonists and of the officials in Saratov. After it was received by Orlov and Catherine, Forster was asked to draft regulations for the colonies that would include improved governance and some degree of autonomy, and finished this work in May 1766. Forster hoped for a government post, but when that did not come true, he asked for permission to leave Russia and payment of 2000 roubles for his time and as compensation for having lost his Nassenhuben post. When he was offered only 1000 roubles, he proudly refused, only receiving 500 roubles from the Russian government much later, in 1771. The Forsters then traveled by boat from Kronstadt to London, where they arrived on 4 October 1766.

== Arrival in England and teaching at Warrington Academy ==
When Forster came to London, he knew very little English. He brought a letter of introduction from Friedrich Dilthey, a Reformed pastor in St Petersburg, to Andrew Planta, pastor of the German Reformed congregation in London and assistant librarian at the British Museum. Planta did not receive Forster as warmly as the latter had expected. Instead of an employment opportunity in England, Planta suggested a pastoral vacancy in North Carolina. Based on the recommendation of Forster&#x27;s school friend Woide, Planta introduced Forster to the naturalist Daniel Solander, who also worked at the British Museum and was a disciple of Linnaeus. Forster sold some items collected during the Russian expedition, including coins and fossils, and tried to find a salaried position in order to bring the rest of his family to England. At the time, they were living in Danzig from the sale of Forster&#x27;s library and supported by relatives. He was introduced to the Society of Antiquaries and elected as an Honorary Fellow in January 1767. Based on the observations from the voyage in Russia, he wrote , an essay in Latin on the natural history of the Volga region that was translated into English and then read at the Royal Society and published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;.
In June 1767, Forster was appointed as tutor in modern languages and natural history at Warrington Academy, replacing Joseph Priestley, with an annual salary of £60. He was able to reunite with his family, who came to Warrington in September 1767. Forster taught French, German, and natural history, and published a textbook on mineralogy in 1768. The geologist and science historian Victor Eyles described Forster&#x27;s approach as &quot;rather more scientific than some of his contemporaries&quot; and giving a &quot;sound grounding in the subject&quot;. Forster became a member of the committee of the Warrington Circulating Library and of the masonic lodge &quot;Lodge of Lights No. 148 Warrington&quot;. He made the acquaintance of other people interested in natural history, including John Blackburne and his daughter Anna Blackburne of Orford Hall. Forster helped Blackburne with the arrangement of her insect collection and presented his lectures on entomology to her, while she provided him with access to the family library. He also struck up a friendship with the naturalist Thomas Pennant, whom he visited at Downing Hall in the summer of 1768. 

Together with his son George, Forster began to translate the works of three of the apostles of Linnaeus into English: Pehr Kalm&#x27;s &quot;Travels into North America&quot;, Pehr Osbeck&#x27;s &quot;A voyage to China and the East Indies&quot;, and Pehr Löfling&#x27;s &quot;Travels through Spain and Cumana in South America&quot;. Forster increasingly was in financial trouble, and started to teach French at the grammar school in Winwick, sharing the duties with his son, who taught the less able pupils. In early 1769, Forster&#x27;s debts and a dispute about discipline and corporeal punishment caused a rift between him and his colleagues, especially John Seddon, and Forster was dismissed, leaving the Academy in June 1769. Religious differences may also have played a role in the dispute. Forster then taught languages at the Boteler Grammar School in Warrington while continuing work on the translations.

== Translator and scholar in London == 
In the summer of 1770, Forster was invited to accompany the geographer Alexander Dalrymple on an East India Company expedition to Balambangan and planned to take George with him as a midshipman. The family moved to London in November 1770, but the plans fell through when Dalrymple was dismissed from the project in March 1771. Forster cultivated a friendship with the lawyer Daines Barrington, a close friend of Pennant and the vice president of the Society of Antiques and of the Royal Society. The translations begun in Warrington started to appear and were successful, with those of Kalm and Osbeck printed in a second edition. Forster additionally translated Jean Bernard Bossu&#x27;s &quot;Travels through that part of America formerly called Louisiana&quot;. He published his own contributions to North American zoology and botany, &quot;A Catalogue of the Animals of North America&quot; and &quot;Florae Americae Septentrionalis; or a Catalogue of the Plants of North America&quot;. The &quot;Catalogue of the Animals&quot;, described by ornithologist Elsa Guerdrum Allen as &quot;the first attempt to cover American fauna&quot;, contains a section with &quot;Directions for Collecting, Preserving and Transporting all Kinds of Natural History Curiosities&quot;, a guide for field studies. In 1771, Forster started writing for &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, contributing reviews of foreign books. Commissioned by Thomas Davies, he started a translation of Louis Antoine de Bougainville&#x27;s , which appeared in 1772 as &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;. On 14 November 1771, a number of Fellows of the Royal Society headed by Barrington and including Joseph Banks and David Solander, endorsed Forster&#x27;s nomination as a Fellow, leading to his election on 27 February 1772. 
Banks and Solander had returned to England in July 1771 from the first voyage of James Cook, and early plans for a second voyage started in August or September 1771. Forster attempted to ingratiate himself with Banks and Solander, for example by dedicating the &quot;Florae Americae Septentrionalis&quot; to Solander and directly suggested that he should accompany Banks on a further voyage when he dedicated his book &quot;Novae Species Insectorum&quot; to Banks. Cook was officially commissioned in November, and when Lord Sandwich, the First Lord of the Admiralty, approached Banks about taking part, he agreed and started assembling an expedition party including scientists and artists as well as musicians. Forster was not chosen by Banks, but they were in regular contact and had an amicable relationship.

== Appointment as naturalist for Cook&#x27;s second voyage == 
On Banks&#x27;s suggestions, significant changes were made to the expedition ship, , in order to accommodate Banks&#x27;s large entourage and their equipment. Alterations included an additional deck and a &quot;roundhouse&quot; on top for the captain, as Banks was to occupy the great cabin. This made the ship so top-heavy that it was deemed unsafe after a first trial at sea, and the additions were removed again at Sheerness Dockyard. When Banks saw the refitted ship on 24 May 1772, he was furious and soon after announced he would not take part in the expedition. On 26 May, Forster received a visit from the naval surgeon and inventor Charles Irving, who, according to Forster&#x27;s journal, &quot;in a very mysterious manner told me, that Mr Banks did not go in the Resolution to the South Seas, &amp; asked whether I would go&quot;. Forster accepted on the only condition that his son George could accompany him as his assistant. 

The English parliament had not long before voted to spend £4,000 for a scientist to accompany Cook on the voyage, which was intended to go to the Scottish physician and naturalist James Lind, whom Banks had chosen as a member of his party. Banks attempted to use his parliamentary contacts and to obtain an audience with the king in order to change the Admiralty&#x27;s decision regarding the ship. Lord Sandwich obtained the king&#x27;s approval for Forster&#x27;s appointment. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Lord North, Sandwich asked him to support Forster, writing On 11 June 1772, the king authorised a payment of £1,795 to Forster from the civil list to prepare for the voyage, which was received on 17 June. After spending £1,500 on books and equipment, Forster went to Plymouth, where HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; arrived on 3 July.

== Voyage around the world ==
Together with a second expedition ship, , &quot;Resolution&quot; sailed from Plymouth on 11 July 1772. The first stop was the Portuguese island of Madeira, where Forster and his servant Ernst Scholient collected plants that were then drawn by Georg. In November 1772, the expedition spent three weeks in the Cape Colony in Southern Africa where Forster and the officers stayed with the trader Christoffel Brand. Forster met Anders Sparrman, a disciple of Linnaeus, and employed him as his scientific assistant for a salary of £50 per year plus expenses. From there they sailed south, making the first recorded crossing of the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773. They sailed to New Zealand and arrived in Tamatea / Dusky Sound on 27 March after four months at sea. They stayed there for five weeks; while Forster complained it was not a good season for proper botany, he managed to describe at least 19 birds as well as several fishes and plants. On an excursion, Forster found a lake that was later named &quot;Lake Forster&quot;. 

After a stay in Queen Charlotte Sound / Tōtaranui, they visited the Society Islands including Tahiti and the Friendly Islands (Tonga) between June and October 1773. After another tour to antarctic waters where the ship reached 71° 10′ southern latitude, a Farthest South record that stood for almost 50 years, they arrived at Easter Island in February 1774. The southern hemisphere winter was spent in Polynesia, and in October 1774 Cook sailed from New Zealand to Tierra del Fuego, where he started a third attempt to sail into the Antarctic. They returned to the Cape of Good Hope in March 1775 and finally to Plymouth, arriving there on 29 July 1775.

== Return to England, publications and controversies ==
After their return to London, Forster and his family moved to 16 Percy Street, St Pancras. He was received by King George III in August 1775 and presented some animal specimens to Queen Charlotte. Forster started to publish the scientific results of the voyage. The first publication was on botany, the book , which appeared in 1775/76. It had been prepared on board and was rushed to publication while containing numerous errors, as Forster saw himself in competition with Banks and hoped to claim the discoveries of plant species for himself. 

In addition to the scientific publications, Forster also expected, based on promises made by Daines Barrington before the voyage, that he would write the official account of the voyage. The report of Cook&#x27;s first voyage, &quot;An Account of the Voyages&quot;, had been compiled by John Hawkesworth for a compensation of £6,000. For the second voyage, Cook, who was dissatisfied with Hawkesworth&#x27;s work, wanted to publish his own account. A compromise between Forster and Cook was negotiated by Lord Sandwich in April 1776. Cook was to write a first volume containing a narrative of the journey and the nautical observations, while Forster would contribute a second volume on natural history and ethnology. The British Admiralty would pay for engravings that should be distributed between the two books. However, Forster&#x27;s sample chapters did not satisfy Sandwich, who claimed they were a narrative instead of a scientific work and asked Richard Owen Cambridge to correct them. Forster found this unacceptable, proudly refused to submit any of his work for corrections and saw himself as the victim of a conspiracy. 

After all attempts at compromise had failed due to Forster&#x27;s obstinacy, Cook worked on his own narrative towards a separate publication. Forster&#x27;s diaries were used by his son George, who was not bound by any contractual agreements, to write &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;, which appeared in March 1777, six weeks before Cook&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage Towards the South Pole, and Round the World&quot;. Forster by then was writing his &quot;Observations Made During a Voyage Round the World&quot; containing the scientific and ethnological results of the voyage as a separate publication. Forster was spending lavishly and soon was in financial difficulties. The publication of &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot; was not successful financially: although the book had good reviews, it was outsold by Cook&#x27;s book, which contained over sixty engravings. By late 1777, the book sales had not yet covered expenses and Forster was so deeply in debt that he was forced to sell some of his library to avoid debtor&#x27;s prison. An important source of money for Forster was his fellow naturalist Banks: in 1776 and 1777, Banks bought drawings and books for almost £1,000 from Forster and additionally loaned him £200.

In 1778, William Wales, the astronomer on board the &quot;Resolution&quot;, published a &quot;Remarks on Mr Forster&#x27;s Account of Captain Cook&#x27;s last Voyage round the World&quot;, attacking Forster (whom he regarded as the true author of &quot;Voyage&quot;, dismissing George&#x27;s authorship) and accused him of lies and misrepresentations. George Forster defended his father with a &quot;Reply to Mr Wales&#x27;s Remarks&quot; containing some factual corrections as well as attacks on Wales and Sandwich. In June 1778, this was followed up by a further attack on Sandwich and his mistress, Martha Ray, the &quot;Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of Sandwich&quot;. After this publication, there was no more possibility of reconciliation with the Admiralty, and the Forsters worked on plans to move to Germany. The family moved to less pricey lodgings in summer of 1778, and George travelled to Germany to obtain a position for his father, but only obtained a professorship of natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel for himself, which was insufficient to support his father&#x27;s large family.

== Professor in Halle ==

In February 1779, Forster was appointed professor of natural history and mineralogy at the University of Halle by Karl Abraham von Zedlitz, the minister of education of the Kingdom of Prussia. The appointment was part of an attempt to raise the profile of the university and was supported by King Frederick the Great. A difficulty that needed to be overcome before Forster could take up the appointment was that his debts amounted to almost £800. George worked in Germany on securing money to help his father and family leave England, succeeding with the help of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and various Freemasons. The only remaining debt was owed to Banks, who did not pursue the matter at the time. In March 1780, Forster&#x27;s paper on penguins was presented by Johann Friedrich Gmelin at the Göttingen Academy of Sciences; it appeared in 1781 and was later described as his &quot;definite treatise&quot; on the penguins. Forster and his family left London for Germany in July 1780. On his way to Halle, Forster spent some time in Berlin, where he was granted an audience with the king, who gave him the title of , approved an increase of his salary in Halle and supported his travel expenses.

In September 1780, Forster was introduced to the Senate of the University. To make up for his lack of teaching credentials, he was given an honorary degree with the title of Doctor of Philosophy . He was made responsible for the university&#x27;s botanical garden, which was run by Philipp Kaspar Junghans who was employed as demonstrator in botany. When Forster&#x27;s supervision ended in 1788, he had added (in his own estimation) 2700 plants to the garden by using his international connections, for example those to Carl Peter Thunberg in Uppsala and William Aiton at Kew.

Forster was made professor of medicine and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine, also , in 1781. He lectured on natural history, based on his own research, an approach that was unpopular with the students. Possibly influenced by his son-in-law Matthias Christian Sprengel, Forster began to teach universal history, geography and statistics using more established teaching texts. He was more successful in terms of student attendance when he lectured in agriculture, and started publishing essays on cultivation, husbandry and general technology. Forster also taught mineralogy from the works of August Ferdinand von Veltheim and translated Tiberius Cavallo&#x27;s mineralogical tables into German. The first edition of 750 copies sold completely and Forster followed it up with an improved second edition. In 1784, he published a work on the exploration of the Arctic, which was translated to English in 1786 as &quot;History of the Voyages and Discoveries in the North&quot;. An attack on Barrington was removed for the English version. In 1790, Forster was elected pro-rector of the University and was responsible among other things for student discipline. He started editing a journal of travel literature, the (&quot;Magazine of new curious travel descriptions&quot;). Although Forster was by 1790 one of the most well-paid academics at Halle and had additional income from his books, he was often in financial difficulties as he spent his money amassing an extensive library with a special focus on maps and travel literature. 

Meanwhile, George had become university librarian in Mainz in 1788. After the city had been captured by French revolutionary troops in 1792, George became a member of the Mainz Jacobin Club and a leading person of the Republic of Mainz. He was sent to Paris as a delegate in 1793 and petitioned for the accession of Mainz into the First French Republic; for this, he was considered a traitor in Germany. George died in Paris on 10 January 1794. Forster wrote a biographical account of his son that was published in the .

== Death and legacy ==

On 9 December 1798 Forster died from an aortic aneurysm after a long suffering from angina. He was buried in arcade number 61 of the municipal cemetery. A memorial plaque for Forster was installed there on 7 May 2016.

After Forster&#x27;s death, Banks forgave his widow the remaining debt of £250. The extensive library and the manuscripts were bought by the Prussian royal library for 8,000 Taler. Forster&#x27;s collection of Pacific artefacts was sold to the Hanoverian government for 80 Taler after negotiations led by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach; it now forms part of the University of Göttingen&#x27;s ethnological collections.

Forster has been generally overshadowed by his more famous son. This is especially true in Germany, where George Forster was rediscovered by East German historians and studied as an early German democrat. However, the Forsters were often seen as a symbiotic unit, especially for some of their work in the natural sciences. In English-language scholarship concerned with the voyages of James Cook, the focus was for a long time on the elder Forster&#x27;s difficult character; his achievements and abilities were downplayed or ignored. The botanist Elmer Drew Merrill accused Forster of plagiarising the work of Solander, but his arguments were later refuted by fellow botanists Dan Henry Nicolson and Francis Raymond Fosberg. The Cook scholar John Beaglehole introduced Forster as &quot;one of the awkward beings of the age&quot; and called him &quot;one of the Admiralty&#x27;s vast mistakes&quot;. Beaglehole attacked Forster at every opportunity in his edition of Cook&#x27;s journals, going so far that the literary scholar Philip Edwards described these attacks as &quot;petty persecution&quot;. Modern study of Forster has resulted in a reassessment of his contributions, especially after the publication of Michael Hoare&#x27;s Forster biography &quot;The Tactless Philosopher&quot; and Hoare&#x27;s edition of Forster&#x27;s journals from the voyage. The Australian art historian Bernard Smith called Forster a &quot;pioneer of social anthropology&quot; in 1985, and &quot;Observations&quot; was described after the publication of a scholarly edition in 1996 as &quot;the beginning of modern geography&quot; by geographer David Stoddart and &quot;one of the most important early examinations of the new Pacific archive&quot; by anthropologist K. R. Howe.

Forster is commemorated by the plant genus &quot;Forstera&quot;, which is considered to have been named by Linnaeus. Its description, probably due to Sparrman and under the name &quot;Forsteria&quot;, was sent to Linnaeus by Forster in a letter and first published by George Forster in 1780. The genus &quot;Forsterygion&quot; of triplefin fishes in New Zealand is named after Forster, who had described &quot;Forsterygion varium&quot;.
Several other taxa are named in his honour, including various plants, but also the emperor penguin, , and Forster&#x27;s tern, .
Geographic features named after Forster include Lake Forster and Mount Forster in Fiordland, New Zealand, and Forster&#x27;s Passage in the South Sandwich Islands. Also named for Forster, the , is an 1805 drainage tunnel for an iron ore mine close to Siegen, Germany, that has been converted to an exhibition mine in 1983.

<text>The 1969 Irish general election to the 19th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 18 June, following the dissolution of the 18th Dáil on 22 May by President Éamon de Valera on the request of Taoiseach Jack Lynch. The general election took place in 42 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, with boundary changes under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1969. The governing Fianna Fáil won its fourth successive election.

The 19th Dáil met at Leinster House on 21 April to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Lynch was re-appointed Taoiseach, forming the 13th government of Ireland, a single-party majority Fianna Fáil government.

==Campaign==

The general election of 1969 saw two new leaders of the two main parties fight their first general election. Jack Lynch of Fianna Fáil had become Taoiseach in 1966 and was attempting to win his first election. Liam Cosgrave had taken charge of Fine Gael in 1965 and now leading his party into his first election. Brendan Corish was fighting his third general election as leader of the Labour Party.

Fianna Fáil had been in office since 1957, and in spite of media predictions, the party was still very popular with the voters. Its leader Jack Lynch proved to be the party&#x27;s biggest electoral asset. His quiet, easy-going and reassuring style, coupled with the catchy slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s back Jack!&quot;, attracted many new voters to Fianna Fáil. The party had introduced many innovative pieces of legislation during the 1960s and was now looking for a fresh mandate. Fianna Fáil were also helped by a deeply divided opposition.

Fine Gael had internal divisions. There was tension between the older conservative members, who wanted to keep the party as it was, and the younger deputies who wanted to move the party to the left. One of the party&#x27;s policies proposed to abolish compulsory Irish for State examinations and civil service jobs.

The Labour Party on the other hand were predicted to make gains after firmly ruling out a pre-election pact with Fine Gael. The party fielded a number of new, high-profile candidates, including Justin Keating, Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, David Thornley and Noël Browne. The slogan &quot;The Seventies will be Socialist&quot; was popular with Labour supporters; however, Fianna Fáil played the &quot;red card&quot;, linking the Labour Party with communism. The tactic worked successfully.

==Result==




; Notes
* Independents include Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta (1,522 votes).

The result marked a third successive victory for Fianna Fáil, led by Jack Lynch. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael each lost votes, yet gained seats. Labour gained votes, yet lost seats. It was the last election for thirty-three years at which a government was returned to office—until the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats government was returned with an increased majority in the 2002 general election.

<text>Thomas Mayo Brewer (November 21, 1814 – January 24, 1880) was an American naturalist, specializing in ornithology and oology.

==Biography ==
Thomas Mayo Brewer was born in Boston, the younger brother of noted Boston merchant Gardner Brewer. He graduated from Harvard College in 1835 and from Harvard Medical School three years later. His interest in ornithology was such that he was elected a member of the Boston Society of Natural History in 1835.

He abandoned his career as a doctor after a few years to concentrate on ornithology, writing and politics, later becoming editor of the &quot;Boston Atlas&quot; in 1840. He was a friend of John James Audubon in that ornithologist&#x27;s later life. In 1849, Brewer was placed in charge of the oological department for the Boston Society of Natural History.

Brewer continued working as a publisher while working as an ornithologist. He joined the publishing firm of Hickling, Swan &amp; Brown, which became Hickling, Swan &amp; Brewer when he became a partner in 1857; this firm subsequently became Swan, Brewer &amp; Tileston. As an editor, he published Alexander Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;.

In 1857, Brewer completed his first of several volumes of &quot;North American Oology&quot;. However, Brewer is best known as a joint author, with Spencer Fullerton Baird and Robert Ridgway, of &quot;A History of North American Birds&quot; (3 volumes, 1874), which was the first attempt since John James Audubon&#x27;s (thirty years prior) to complete the study of American ornithology.

Brewer also contributed to a number of ornithological publications, including John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Ornithological Biography.&quot; Brewer was a companion to Audubon, who gave Brewer&#x27;s name to a duck, a blackbird, and a mole found in Martha&#x27;s vineyard.

In his last decade of life, Brewer sparred with Elliott Coues over the fate of the House Sparrow, a recently introduced bird that was multiplying far faster than expected. While Coues and most ornithologists were in favor of killing many of them off, Brewer tried to defend them. This ornithological event is known as &quot;The Sparrow War.&quot;

Brewer died in Boston on January 24, 1880, while the fate of the sparrow was still being debated.

==Personal life==
Brewer married Sally Coffin in 1849. They had two children.

The Brewer family has been prominent in Massachusetts for 200 years, including James Brewer (1742–1806), an early American patriot leader and businessman, Gen. Wilmon Blackmar, a Civil War medal of honor winner, and Wilmon Brewer, a poet, biographer, and philanthropist.

<text>The 1965 Irish general election to the 18th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 7 April, following the dissolution of the 17th Dáil on 18 March by President Éamon de Valera on the request of Taoiseach Seán Lemass. The general election took place in 38 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. The governing Fianna Fáil saw a slight increase, though did not obtain a majority.

The 18th Dáil met at Leinster House on 21 April to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Lemass was re-appointed Taoiseach, forming the 11th government of Ireland, a single-party minority Fianna Fáil government.

==Campaign==
The general election of 1965 followed the failure of the governing Fianna Fáil to gain a seat in a by-election on 10 March 1965. The success of Eileen Desmond of the Labour Party in Cork Mid in holding a seat previously held by her husband Dan Desmond, led to an unacceptable mathematical situation with regard to the government&#x27;s majority. On 18 March, the Taoiseach, Seán Lemass dissolved the Dáil and the campaign began in earnest.

Fianna Fáil ran its campaign on its record in government. Over the last number of years, the economy had seen a huge improvement and the party played up on its record in government. The party also played up heavily on the personality of the party leader with the slogan &quot;Let Lemass Lead On&quot;. Fine Gael put forward a comprehensive manifesto, which included the establishment of a government department concerned with economic planning. However, the older, conservative members of the party did not warm to the new turn the party was taking.

==Television and radio==
This was the first Irish general election to be covered on television by state broadcaster RTÉ, which had formed on 31 December 1961. &quot;Election Newsroom&quot; was broadcast live on Telefís Éireann from their Donnybrook studios in Dublin, presented by John O&#x27;Donoghue with analysis provided by John Healy (&quot;The Irish Times&quot;), John O&#x27;Sullivan (&quot;The Cork Examiner&quot;), Garret FitzGerald and Professor Basil Chubb. Cameras were present in four count centres: Bolton Street (Dublin), Wexford, Cork and Monaghan. The GPO provided direct links as results were announced. Raidió Éireann provided special coverage from 3 pm on the day of the count due to the coverage on Telefís Éireann. It was a new approach to election coverage on the state&#x27;s radio service, which began broadcasting in 1926.

In November 1966, Lemass resigned as Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach, and was succeeded in both positions by Jack Lynch, who formed the 12th Government of Ireland.

<doc id="399851" wikidata="Q56220" url="?curid=399851" title="Ivo Sanader">
<text>Ivo Sanader (; born 8 June 1953) is a Croatian former politician who served as Prime Minister of Croatia from 2003 to 2009. He is currently serving a 18-year prison sentence for corruption in Lipovica prison.

Sanader is to date the second longest-serving prime minister since Croatia&#x27;s independence, holding the office for over five and a half years before resigning in July 2009. He is one of only two Croatian prime ministers (along with Andrej Plenković) who have served more than one term, winning the general elections in 2003 and 2007. He is also, along with Ivica Račan and Plenković, one of the three prime ministers who have been at the head of more than one government cabinet, chairing his first cabinet from 23 December 2003 until 12 January 2008, and his second cabinet from 12 January 2008 until his resignation on 6 July 2009.

Sanader obtained his education in comparative literature in Austria, where he also worked as a journalist, in marketing, publishing, and as an entrepreneur. In the 1990s, he was briefly the intendant of the Croatian National Theatre in Split before becoming Minister for Science and Technology as a member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in the cabinet of Hrvoje Šarinić in 1992. In 1993, he moved into diplomacy and served two terms as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Following the death of Franjo Tuđman, Sanader was elected president of the HDZ in 2000, and again in 2002, and led the party to victory in the 2003, and 2007 elections, becoming Croatia&#x27;s Prime Minister. In June 2009, he abruptly resigned his post, leaving scarce explanation for his actions and disappearing from public life for a while. In January 2010, he tried to stage a political comeback within the HDZ, but was ejected from party membership.

In December 2010, Croatian authorities indicted Sanader in two high-profile corruption cases. He fled the country but was apprehended in Austria and extradited to Croatia in July 2011. In November 2012, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in a first instance verdict, later reduced to years, for funneling 10.4 million euros in public money to the Fimi Media company. However, his sentence was annulled by Croatia&#x27;s Constitutional Court in 2015. With the exception of numerous Croatian officials who were sentenced to imprisonment during the existence of the socialist Yugoslavia, he is the first Croatian head of government and highest ranking state official to be tried and sentenced to a jail term. In October 2018, Sanader was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for war profiteering and ordered to return $570,000 in kickbacks from Hypo Bank. In November 2020, he was sentenced to eight years in jail for his role in a retrial of the Fimi Media case. Some Croatian journalists evaluate Sanader&#x27;s leadership of Croatia as a &quot;kleptocratic-clientelistic era&quot;.

==Early life==
Sanader was born in Split to a poor, religious, working-class family originating from Dugobabe, a village in the Split hinterland. He was one of five children so, as his family was financially unable to support their education, his mother asked the rector of the Archbishopric Classical Gymnasium to accept Ivo as a student. At the gymnasium, Sanader distinguished himself as one of the top students, excelling in history and languages. After completing high school, Sanader spent one year in Rome studying philosophy. Following his return from Rome he met Mirjana Šarić, whom he married in 1978.

After their wedding, Ivo and Mirjana, and Ivo&#x27;s younger brother Miro left Split for Innsbruck, Austria. His wife studied archaeology, while Ivo studied comparative literature and Romance languages at the University of Innsbruck. During that time, Sanader worked as a correspondent for the Zagreb sport newspaper &quot;Sportske novosti&quot;.

In 1982, Sanader received his PhD degree, and returned to Croatia (then Yugoslavia) with his wife. He found a job in the marketing department of Dalmacijaturist (Dalmatia Tourist), for a brief period, followed by a lengthy period at the publishing house Logos from 1983, initially as a program editor. In 1988 he became a chief editor, at one time working on the magazine &quot;Mogućnosti&quot; (Possibilities). His career at the publishing house was later terminated. At that time, his wife also received a notice of termination from her workplace.

In 1987, Sanader decided to return to Austria with his family, where he co-founded two businesses, one in 1989 which was liquidated by a court in 1992, while the other existed between 1986 and 2001. Failure of his businesses prompted Sanader to enter politics in the 1990s.

Apart from his native Croatian, he is fluent in English, German, French, and Italian.

==Political career==
===Beginnings (1990s–2000)===
Unlike many Croatian political figures of Sanader&#x27;s generation, he was not actively involved in politics in his younger years – neither as a member of the League of Communists of Croatia (Croatia&#x27;s party which formed the single bloc which governed Yugoslavia), nor as a dissident in exile.

In October 1990, after multi-party system had returned to Yugoslavia, he founded the Tirol branch of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in Austria, and established contact with Franjo Tuđman. Sanader&#x27;s organizational skills, erudition, and fluency in German left a favorable impression on HDZ members with whom he collaborated in Austria. He decided to return to Split, over the objections of his wife who saw war in Croatia looming. His first public office was intendant of the Croatian National Theatre in Split. Shortly after taking the office, he was joined by his wife, who got a job in the University Library in Split.

In 1992 he was elected as an HDZ deputy to the lower house of the Croatian parliament, and became Minister of Science and Technology (1992–1993). From 1993 to 1995 and 1996 to 2000, he was a Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, overseeing the termination of required visas for Croatian citizens who traveled to Greece. He also used his negotiation skills to bring people to the Croatian Democratic Union from other Croatian parliamentary parties.

At the end of November 1995, he became Chief of Staff of the President of Croatia&#x27;s office and General Secretary of the Croatian National Security and Defense Council (VONS) after Hrvoje Šarinić and Goran Drozdek were released from their duties. In January 1996 he became a member of the Council for Cooperation between Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

During his second term as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs he worked to bring Croatia and Israel together. Himself, Hrvoje Šarinić and Eytan Bentsur, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Israeli government, met in Budapest in 1997, at which point diplomatic relations between Croatia and Israel were established.

===Leader of Opposition (2000–03)===
In 2000, following Tuđman&#x27;s death, HDZ suffered defeat in a parliamentary election. Furthermore, their candidate Mate Granić also failed to enter the second round of the presidential election. Granić then left to form the Democratic Centre party hoping to attract moderates from the HDZ. Inner-party election within the HDZ ensued in April that year and Sanader emerged victorious as a compromise candidate.

Initially, Sanader criticized the unpopular International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indictments against Croatian Army generals. In 2001, he took part in a massive rally protesting a war crimes indictment against general Mirko Norac. Sanader also criticised Ivica Račan and his cabinet&#x27;s stance towards the ICTY. He gradually began to distance the party and himself from the protests, softening his criticism towards the government.

Sanader focused his efforts on transforming the HDZ into a modern pro-European right-of-center party. However, his course was challenged by the more conservative wing of the party led by Ivić Pašalić. The ensuing leadership struggle culminated at the 2002 party convention. Sanader, who was supported by Vladimir Šeks and convicted war criminal Branimir Glavaš, managed to win his second mandate. Pašalić left the party to form his Croatian Bloc, but failed to draw many of his former supporters from the HDZ.

Sanader was later accused by Ivan Drmić, a former member of the Croatian Democratic Union, for rigging the presidential election at the 5th convention of the Croatian Democratic Union. Spokesman for the Croatian Democratic Union Ratko Maček said such accusations &quot;belong in the anthology of political stupidity.&quot;

Sanader was able to concentrate on defeating Ivica Račan and his left-of-centre coalition at the 2003 parliamentary elections. HDZ won the election, but did not win an absolute majority in Sabor.

===Prime Minister (2003–2009)===
====First term (2003–2008)====
After the victory of his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) the President of the Republic named Sanader the Prime Minister-designate on 9 December 2003. In the post-election negotiations Sanader ensured the support of ethnic minority representatives, nominally left-wing Croatian Party of Pensioners and the Independent Democratic Serb Party. When the Croatian Parliament subsequently gave its consent by 88 votes (out of 152) on 23 December 2003, Sanader was formally appointed.

The Sanader government&#x27;s main foreign goal was Croatia&#x27;s entry into the European Union and NATO. As a result of the successful implementation of the Association Agreement – signed with the European Union in 2001 – Croatia did become an official candidate for entry into the EU. Sanader&#x27;s HDZ also sought to establish better relations with minority parties and to promote minority rights. Amongst other factors contributing to the positive opinion of the European Commission and the European Council regarding Croatia&#x27;s bid to become an EU member were Croatia&#x27;s cooperation with the ICTY, continued economic growth and the country&#x27;s compliance with political and economic criteria established by the 1993 Copenhagen European Council.

Sanader was the last statesman to visit Pope John Paul II in Vatican City, in February 2005, a few weeks before his death on 2 April 2005.

In October 2005, following the formal start of EU accession negotiations, opinion polls showed Sanader to be the most popular Croatian politician.

Škare Ožbolt reported that Sanader possessed a collection of wrist watches worth in excess of €150,000 which he had not declared as assets. Former Minister of Justice Vesna Škare-Ožbolt in the Sanader government was the one who reported Sanader to a resolution council for conflict of interests.

As Prime Minister, Sanader had close relations with other moderate conservative politicians in Europe: including former Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, former Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, and Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern. The cabinet saw some changes during Sanader&#x27;s term, notably the departure of the foreign minister Miomir Žužul who was accused of conflict of interest. His government was challenged by the rising tide of Euroscepticism in the country.

In July 2006, Sanader was named in the &quot;Verona Affair&quot;, accused by the opposition in the Croatian parliament for fixing the sale of pharmaceutical company Pliva to Barr Pharmaceuticals from the US. The accusations were denied and never proved.

&quot;Nacional&quot;, an independent political weekly, reported Sanader was a part of two bankrupt businesses in Austria, and received bribes in 1995 and 1996 from a tycoon amounting to 800,000 DEM.

====Second term (2008–2009)====
After the closely contested 2007 parliamentary election, and the first ever situation of ambiguity on who gets the mandate to form a government, Sanader emerged as the winner when President Stjepan Mesić gave him his second mandate, though this time in a coalition with the HSS and the HSLS.

Owing in part to the global recession that set in during Sanader&#x27;s term, Croatia&#x27;s economic growth stalled and foreign direct investments slowed down. While displaying symptoms of economic decline shared by larger nations, Croatia&#x27;s decline during Sanader&#x27;s term was amplified in comparison with the fortunes of Serbia and next door Montenegro – who gained greater investments due to major reforms. Under Sanader, judicial reforms in Croatia stopped and the land registry issue was not resolved. Over 1.3 million court cases (in a country of 4.1 million people) were yet to be resolved in 2009.

Croatia was expected to complete negotiations with the EU in 2009. However, the negotiations were stalled for 10 months due to Slovenia&#x27;s blockade of Croatia&#x27;s EU accession in December 2008. On 1 July 2009, Sanader announced his resignation as the Prime Minister and Leader of the HDZ, as well as his complete withdrawal from all active politics, adding that he does not intend to return. At his press conference in Zagreb, Sanader remarked: &quot;There is always a time in life for a new beginning. Such a moment has come and now it is time for others to take over.&quot; According to BBC News, the announcement &quot;came as a surprise&quot;, as Croatian media had quite recently named Sanader as a potential candidate for the 2010 presidential election. He announced that his prime minister-designate would be deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor.

The Croatian Parliament accepted his resignation on 2 July 2009 and informed the President. Sanader was elected Honorary President of the HDZ for life.

===Departure and return to politics (2009–2010)===
At the September 2009 Global Creative Economic Summit, Sanader discussed Croatia&#x27;s shift from a heavily controlled economy to a bustling &quot;knowledge-based&quot; economy. According to Sanader, fostering the &quot;competitiveness in everyday life&quot; played an important role in this process.

On 3 January 2010, contrary to his earlier statements (1 July 2009), Sanader announced he would be returning to a more active role in politics, stating that his decision to withdraw was a mistake, and that the HDZ is a &quot;winning party and not a party that wins 12% of the vote&quot;, a remark made in connection with the first round of the presidential election held one week before. He was supported by a dozen HDZ MPs, including Luka Bebić, but none of the members of the Government. Several of those MPs later disclaimed any association with Sanader and claimed they were misled.

On 4 January 2010, following an entire day of meetings of HDZ leadership, Ivo Sanader was expelled from the Croatian Democratic Union. Of 22 members of the party presidency, 16 voted for expulsion, three were against (Luka Bebić, Mario Zubović and Damir Polančec) and two abstained (Bianca Matković and Petar Selem). Sanader himself was not present at the meeting.

In October 2010, Sanader reactivated his parliamentary seat and regained parliamentary immunity.

===Arrest in Austria===
On 9 December 2010, he was spotted crossing the border into Slovenia, driven by his younger daughter Bruna shortly before the Croatian parliament voted to remove his immunity from prosecution by the Croatian Bureau for Combating Corruption and Organized Crime (USKOK). The next day the Croatian police issued an arrest warrant and applied to Interpol requesting his arrest to face charges of corruption. He was arrested near Salzburg, Austria on 10 December 2010. Croatian authorities froze his assets and bank accounts, and formally applied for extradition on 13 December.

Austrian authorities, including a Carinthian parliamentary committee inquiring into the more recent Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International scandal, have questioned Sanader while in custody, while USKOK expanded its investigation of Sanader to include alleged bribes by the Hypo Bank in the 1990s.

Sanader is alleged to have received nearly $695,000 (£432,000) for arranging a loan from the Austrian Hypo Bank in 1995, launching accusations of war profiteering, and of receiving 10 million euros in bribes from the CEO of the Hungarian oil company MOL, Zsolt Hernádi, to secure MOL a dominant position in the Croatian oil company INA.

===Extradition, trials and imprisonment (2011–present)===
Sanader was extradited by Austria on 18 July 2011. He was transferred to Remetinec prison in Zagreb.

At his first court hearing on 28 October, he complained of heart problems, and he stated that he did not even know he was being taken to court. After hearing this, the judge decided to reschedule, and Sanader was taken to the hospital. His rescheduled court hearing took place in December 2011 and he was released on bail of $2.2 million on 16 December 2011. In January 2012, it was announced that Sanader was facing a new set of corruption charges. USKOK included Sanader in its investigation into Croatia&#x27;s state-owned electric company HEP&#x27;s financial irregularities, including losses of $100 million, based on a witness statement that Sanader accepted a bribe to ensure lower electricity prices.

In May 2012, it was announced that Sanader could be indicted again on corruption offences. It was alleged that he could be charged for his involvement in arranging the sale of electricity to Croatian petrochemical company Dioki Group at prices below market, which damaged the state electricity company HEP by several million Kunas. The former CEO and owner of Dioki, Ivan Mravak and Robert Jezic could also face charges.

In September 2012, A fifth indictment was filed against Ivo Sanader for damaging the state budget by 26 million kuna (3.6 million euro). Prosecutors claimed that the damage was done by selling a building built by Fiolic&#x27;s firm to the Ministry of Regional Development for more than twice the price that the building was actually worth.

According to calculations of Croatian news site Politika Plus from 2012, total damage done to the budget due to corruption scandals involving Sanader counts at least 207 million kuna. He was indicted five times in total; in Fimi Media, Planinska, INA-MOL, Hypo and HEP cases.

On 20 November 2012, Sanader was sentenced to 10 years in prison in a first-degree verdict for Hypo and INA-MOL cases. He was the highest official in Croatia to be convicted of corruption. Sanader denied wrongdoing and stated that his trial was politically motivated. The judge, Ivan Turudić, said that Sanader had disgraced Croatia, adding that he had used his office for his own personal enrichment and not for the common good. Sanader was transferred from the court to the Remetinec prison.

In June 2014, the Supreme Court of Croatia confirmed the 2012 verdict, but reduced Sanader&#x27;s prison sentence to years. On that occasion, president Ivo Josipović described Sanader&#x27;s involvement in MOL&#x27;s acquisition of INA as &quot;high treason&quot;. In 2015, the verdict was quashed by the Constitutional Court based on procedural errors made during the trial. After spending nearly 5 years both in custody and prison, he was released and set to stand a retrial.

In 2017, he was sentenced to years in Planinska case. In April 2019, this conviction was confirmed by Supreme Court and sentence raised to 6 years. Since then, Sanader has been incarcerated.

In 2020, he was convicted and sentenced to an additional sentence of 8 years in prison as the result of retrial in the Fimi Media case. That same year, he was convicted and sentenced to an additional sentence of 6 years in prison for the INA-MOL case. Both of these verdicts were confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2021, with the sentence in the Fimi Media case having been reduced to 7 years. His acquittal in the HEP case was confirmed that same year.

In 2022, he was acquitted in Hypo case, but that has yet to be confirmed by the Supreme Court. In 2023, his sentences stemming from the three convictions were merged into one single sentence totaling 18 years and 8 months, and later reduced to 18 years by the Supreme Court.

As of 2024, he is serving his sentence at Lipovica prison and cannot be released before 2033.

==Honors==
===Revoked===
On 15 July 2014, President Ivo Josipović revoked all of Sanader&#x27;s national decorations following the final judgment by the Supreme Court by which he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 8 years and 6 months due to his corruption while he served as Prime Minister.

<text>The 1961 Irish general election to the 17th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 4 October, following the dissolution of the 16th Dáil on 15 September by President Éamon de Valera on the request of Taoiseach Seán Lemass. The general election took place in 38 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, which had been reduced in size by three seats from the previous election by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1961. Fianna Fáil lost its majority but remained the dominant party.

The 17th Dáil met at Leinster House on 11 October to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Lemass was re-appointed Taoiseach, forming the 10th government of Ireland, a single-party minority Fianna Fáil government.

==Campaign==
At the general election of 1961, the three main parties were led by new leaders: Seán Lemass had taken charge of Fianna Fáil in 1959, making this the first time Fianna Fáil faced a general election campaign without Éamon de Valera (who had become President of Ireland in 1959). James Dillon had taken over at Fine Gael in 1959 also, while the Labour Party was now under the leadership of Brendan Corish.

Lemass announced the date of the election on 8 September, with the dissolution to take place a week later on 15 September. It was the shortest period between the dissolution and the election permitted in law.

While the election was caused by the &quot;crisis&quot; surrounding Ireland&#x27;s application for membership of the European Economic Community and various other international affairs, little attention was paid to these matters during the campaign; the 1961 general election has become known as the dullest campaign on record, with the most important issue being the teaching of the Irish language in schools. Fianna Fáil fought the election on its record in government and a reforming theme; Fine Gael presented itself as the party of free enterprise. The Labour Party campaigned strongly against the &quot;conservative&quot; Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties. It also favoured major expansion in the public sector. It was the first and only general election contested by the National Progressive Democrats led by Noël Browne.

<text>The 1957 Irish general election to the 16th Dáil was held on Tuesday, 5 March, following a dissolution of the 15th Dáil on 12 February by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly on the request of Taoiseach John A. Costello on 4 February. It was the longest election campaign in the history of the state, spanning 30 days. The general election took place in 40 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 147 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas.

The 16th Dáil met at Leinster House on 20 March to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Costello lost office, and Éamon de Valera was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 8th government of Ireland, a single-party majority Fianna Fáil government.

==Campaign==
The 1957 general election was precipitated by the crisis in the trade balance and the government&#x27;s reaction to it. As a result of this crisis, Fianna Fáil tabled a motion of no confidence in the inter-party government of Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan. The Dáil had been scheduled to resume on 13 February. Rather than face defeat in the vote, on 4 February the Taoiseach John A. Costello, sought a dissolution of the Dáil for 12 February. The campaign was fought largely over economic issues and the situation in Northern Ireland. In the North, the IRA had launched Operation Harvest which drew much popular support in the south. Sinn Féin had been re-built and re-organized as a party by Paddy McLogan and was fielding abstentionist candidates.

Fianna Fáil had produced a major policy document in January, criticising many of its own policies in regard to the economy. While they did not know an election was imminent this became the backbone of their manifesto. The importance of free trade was played up by Fianna Fáil in a clear rejection of the protectionist policies they had advocated in the past. The architect of many of these new policies was the spokesperson for Industry and Commerce and the heir-apparent of the party, Seán Lemass. At 75 years of age Éamon de Valera was fighting his last general election as leader of the party. In spite of his age, he carried out a vigorous campaign, often being accompanied by brass bands and torch-lit processions. The Fianna Fáil message was simple: coalition governments were unstable.

The other parties, most of them having enjoyed a stint in government over the previous three years, fought the election on their record in office, Fine Gael in particular. Clann na Talmhan failed to broaden their appeal and remained the voice of the farmers. Clann na Poblachta under Seán MacBride had agreed not to stand in constituencies where Sinn Féin were fielding candidates and lost two of its three seats. Sinn Féin, fighting one of its first post-war elections on an abstentionist ticket won 4 seats.

De Valera failed to secure a majority, and John A. Costello was appointed Taoiseach, forming the second inter-party government, a minority coalition of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan.

==Campaign==
After the 1951 general election, Fianna Fáil had formed a minority single-party government. Shortly after the Minister for Finance, Seán McEntee, had delivered the 1954 budget, Éamon de Valera called a general election.

Fianna Fáil had the most to lose, their campaign concentrated on providing political stability for the next five years. They also put forward strong arguments against coalition governments. However, this would not suffice when the country&#x27;s economy was worsening and unemployment and emigration were increasing.

The opposition parties of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the other minor parties offered the electorate an alternative to three years of Fianna Fáil rule.

<text>Shavkat Miromonovich Mirziyoyev (born 24 July 1957) is an Uzbek politician who has served as President of Uzbekistan and Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan since 14 December 2016. Previously, Mirziyoyev led the government as a Prime Minister of Uzbekistan from 2003 to 2016.

Mirziyoyev joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. He was elected as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR in 1990. From mid-1990s, he headed several regions of Jizzakh and Samarqand as a governor (hakim) before his appointment as the head of government by then-President Islam Karimov.

Following the death of President Karimov, Mirziyoyev was appointed by the Oliy Majlis as acting president of Uzbekistan on 8 September 2016. He was subsequently elected to a full five-year term as president in the 2016 election from the Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party (OʻzLiDeP), winning 88.6% of the vote. Mirziyoyev was re-elected for second five-year term with 80.3% of the vote in the 2021 presidential election, and then again for a renewed first seven-year term with 87.7% of the vote in a snap 2023 presidential election as an independent candidate with the OʻzLiDeP backing, after a constitutional amendment had granted him to legally run for third time after resetting his presidential term of office.

Under his presidency, Mirziyoyev implemented a range of liberal reforms in Uzbekistan’s political and economic system by attracting foreign investment, improving relations with neighboring Central Asian countries, as well as release of political prisoners that was notably accompanied by closure of the infamous Jaslyk Prison in 2019. In late 2021, he announced a series of constitutional reforms which included an abolition of capital punishment and the protection of human rights, which were ratified following the 2023 constitutional referendum with an overwhelming 90.6% of support. One of the proposed changes had initially included a removal of the semi-autonomous Karakalpakstan&#x27;s right to secession, which led to deadly unrest in the region in July 2022 with the protests being brutally suppressed and resulting in the scrapping of the controversial proposal.

==Early life and career==
Mirziyoyev was born on 24 July 1957 in the Jizzakh Region of the Uzbek SSR. Some media outlets alleged that he was actually born in the village of Yakhtan in the Leninabad Oblast (now the Sughd Region) of Tajikistan, and even unconfirmed claims that he was allegedly a Tajik. After an investigation by several journalists, it was revealed that Yakhtan is the native home of Mirziyoyev&#x27;s grandfather on his father&#x27;s side, and that Mirziyoyev himself is an Uzbek, and not a Tajik. His father, Miromon Mirziyoyevich Mirziyoyev, worked as a physician for most of his life until death. He worked as the head physician of the tuberculosis dispensary in Zaamin. O‘rinbek Yoqubov, a cousin of Miromon, being a veteran of World War II, became a Hero of the Soviet Union in April 1944. Shavkat&#x27;s mother Marifat, died at a young age from tuberculosis, which she contracted in the Zaamin tuberculosis dispensary, where she worked as a nurse. After the death of his wife, Miromon Mirziyoyev married a second time to a woman from Tatarstan.

In 1981, Mirziyoyev graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Melioration. He holds a Candidate (Ph.D.) degree in Technological Sciences. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. In early 1990, he was elected as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR&#x27;s last legislative body before the independence of Uzbekistan in 1991. The ceremony took place in the Senate and State Legislative Assembly Building in Tashkent.

== Political career ==
He served as governor (&quot;Hakim&quot;) of Jizzakh Region from 1996 to September 2001, then as governor of Samarqand Region from September 2001 until his appointment as prime minister in 2003. He was nominated as prime minister by President Islam Karimov on 12 December 2003, and approved by the Uzbek parliament. He replaced Prime Minister Oʻtkir Sultonov. His deputy was Ergash Shoismatov and his press secretary was Sherzodkhon Kudratkhuja.

Mirziyoyev and Han Myeong-sook, the Prime Minister of South Korea, met in Tashkent on 25 September 2006. They signed several agreements, including one deal in which Uzbekistan was to send 300 tons of Uzbek uranium ore to South Korea every year from 2010 to 2014. The deal bypasses U.S. companies that acted previously as middlemen for South Korean imports of Uzbek uranium ore. Han also met with President Islam Karimov and parliament speaker Erkin Xalilov. Han and Mirziyoyev boosted cooperation in the energy, agriculture, construction, architecture, and information technology sectors. Trade between South Korea and Uzbekistan increased by nearly 40% between 2005 and 2006, to $565 million.

According to a 2017 report by Human Rights Watch on forced and child labour in the cotton sector of Uzbekistan, during his time as prime minister from 2003 to 2016 Mirziyoyev &quot;oversaw the cotton production system, and as the previous governor of Jizzakh and Samarkand, he was in charge of two cotton-producing regions. The 2016 harvest, when Mirziyoyev was acting president and retained control over cotton production, continued to be defined by mass involuntary mobilization of workers under threat of penalty.&quot; The report states that during a 2015 conference call with local authorities and farmers, Mirziyoyev said “Go to the homes of farmers in debt, who can&#x27;t repay their credit, take their cars, livestock, and if there are none, take the slate from their roofs!”

On 24 October 2021, Uzbekistan&#x27;s Central Election Commission announced that Mirziyoyev received 80.1 percent of the vote and will serve a second five-year term.

==Presidency==

A member of the Samarkand clan, he was considered to be one of the leading potential successors to Islam Karimov as President of Uzbekistan. Mirziyoyev was reported to have friendly relations with Karimov&#x27;s wife, Tatyana Karimova, and National Security Council chairman Rustam Inoyatov.

After the death of Karimov was announced on 2 September 2016, Mirziyoyev was appointed as head of the committee organizing the funeral of the President. That was taken as a sign that Mirziyoyev would succeed Karimov as president. On 8 September 2016, he was appointed as interim president of Uzbekistan by a joint session of both houses of parliament. Although the chairman of the Senate, Nigmatilla Yuldashev, was constitutionally designated as Karimov&#x27;s successor, Yuldashev proposed that Mirziyoyev take the post of interim president instead in light of Mirziyoyev&#x27;s &quot;many years of experience&quot;. There were expectations that Mirziyoyev would repair Uzbek relations with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. He started to settle a long-running border dispute with Kyrgyzstan, and regular flights between the capitals of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were set to resume in January 2017 for the first time since 1992.

The electoral commission announced on 16 September that Mirziyoyev would stand in the December 2016 presidential election as the candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party.

Mirziyoyev won the election, held on 4 December 2016, with 88.6% of the vote according to official results, defeating three minor candidates. The election was described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as a sham; the paper wrote that Mirziyoyev&#x27;s bent was as authoritarian as that of Karimov and that state media claimed the choice was between Mirziyoyev, chaos, or Islamic radicalism. It also claimed that the three opponents were only on the ballot to keep up the appearance of pluralism. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said the election lacked &quot;a genuine choice,&quot; pointing to instances of ballot box stuffing and proxy voting.

On 12 December 2016, Deputy Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov was nominated to take over from Mirziyoyev as prime minister. Mirziyoyev was sworn in as president on 14 December, vowing to &quot;continue the work of my dear teacher, the great statesman Islam Karimov&quot;, while also promising &quot;many changes in the cabinet&quot;. Aripov was confirmed as prime minister by parliament on the same day; a cabinet reshuffle followed on 15 December. On 6 March 2017, he made a state visit to Turkmenistan; it was his first foreign trip after the election.

=== Domestic reforms ===
In the three months following the death of Islam Karimov, Mirziyoyev began to hint at reforms to longstanding policies that had held back the Uzbek economy and isolated the country internationally, so many analysts believed that Mirziyoyev would be a better president than his predecessor.

However, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development noted that &quot;The people of Uzbekistan play no part in political decision-making processes. So far, no parliamentary or presidential election held in the post-Soviet era has been considered as either free or fair by the international community... Given the sensitive political situation in Uzbekistan, development cooperation activities there are implemented as far away from government circles as possible.&quot; Nevertheless, some positive results of his rule are visible. Uzbekistan created more than 336,000 new jobs in 2017. The volume of exports increased by almost 15 percent. In 2018, the total financial indicator of exports is expected at 12.1 billion US dollars. He initiated the project of &quot;Tashkent City&quot;, intended to attract foreign investors to Uzbekistan. Mirziyoyev promised to resume negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on joining the organization in 2018. On several occasions, he sharply criticized the administration and officials in the presence of media.

On 22 December, the first time in the country&#x27;s history, Shavkat Mirziyoyev made an appeal to the parliament. His speech lasted four hours. He said:
Some analysts think Mirziyoyev wants to enter in history as a reformer. He removed most of Karimov&#x27;s officials and urged government to employ &quot;new, young people who love their country.&quot; After a year in office, Mirziyoyev is increasingly moving away from his predecessor&#x27;s policy, which is especially visible in his active foreign policy. He visited all the Uzbek regions and big cities to get acquainted with the implementation of the projects and reforms which he had ordered. Many analysts and Western media compared his rule with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping or Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev; his rule has been quoted as being an &quot;Uzbek Spring&quot;.

At the end of that year, he was named the &quot;Asian of the Year of 2018&quot; by the Asia Journalist Association (AJA).

In August 2019 he closed the notorious Jaslyk Prison.

In July 2021, Mirziyoyev&#x27;s spokesperson attempted to generate some suspense as to whether or not the President would run in the elections again. It was widely acknowledged that Mirziyoyev would not only participate but likely win.

==== Constitutional reform ====
On 1 July 2022 protests broke out in the autonomous region of Karakalpakstan over proposed amendments to the Constitution of Uzbekistan which would have ended Karakalpakstan&#x27;s status as an autonomous region of Uzbekistan and right to secede from Uzbekistan via referendum. They were brutally suppressed, at least 18 people were killed.

In April 2023, a referendum was held in Uzbekistan to change the constitution. The adopted amendments increased the presidential term from 5 to 7 years. The number of terms is still limited to two, but due to a change in the constitution, Mirziyoyev&#x27;s previous presidencies are not counted. Shortly thereafter, the head of state called early elections. They passed on July 9, 2023. Mirziyoyev won with 87% of the vote on a turnout of almost 80%.

===Foreign policy===
Mirziyoyev&#x27;s foreign policy is much more open than the policy of his predecessor. Uzbekistan was practically under international isolation after the Andijan massacre in 2005 and Karimov rarely travelled outside of Central Asia and other CIS states. Mirziyoyev promised to conduct an active foreign policy at the beginning of his tenure.

During the first 10 months of his tenure, Mirziyoyev visited Kazakhstan four times, Turkmenistan three times, Russia two times, as well as China, Saudi Arabia, United States, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan. At the different occasions, he met the presidents of Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Bulgaria, Belarus and the King of Spain. During the CIS Summit in Tashkent in November 2017, he met eight Prime Ministers of foreign countries.

==== Regional policy ====

One of his most significant foreign policy achievements is the gradual improvement of relations with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. On 5 September 2017, just 3 days after the anniversary of the death of his predecessor, he made a historic visit to Kyrgyzstan. This was the first state visit of an Uzbek president to the neighboring country since 2000. On 19 September 2017, Mirziyoyev addressed the UN General Assembly for the first time.

In 2018, a large number of foreign leaders visited or were expected in Uzbekistan, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whose visit took place in September and was his first state visit to the country in 24 years. In March 2018, Mirziyoyev made a visit to Tajikistan, which made him the first Uzbek president to conduct a state visit to Dushanbe since 2000.

In March 2019, Mirziyoyev held a telephone conversation with Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had resigned from office that day. In it, he expressed regret to the ex-president, saying that he was a &quot;great politician&quot;. During a visit to Abu Dhabi in March 2019, Mirziyoyev came away from his talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed with over $10 billion in infrastructure, alternative energy and agriculture deals, as well as deals in other spheres.

In 2022 Uzbekistan hosted the 22nd Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Samarkand. During the summit, which was attended by world leaders Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iran&#x27;s Ebrahim Raisi, Azerbaijan&#x27;s Ilham Aliyev, presidents of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia, and the prime ministers of Pakistan and India, it was noted that the Chinese and Indian leaders chastised President Putin about his role in Ukraine. In preparation for the Summit, the president ordered that the city be redeveloped. This included the construction of a new international airport and a tourism complex that has had mixed reviews.

==== Afghanistan ====
Mirziyoyev has also taken an important role in Afghanistan by offering to host peace talks between the government and the Taliban since March 2018. During the week of 6–10 August 2018, a Taliban delegation visited Tashkent, at the request of Mirziyoyev, to discuss issues including transport, power and peace in Afghanistan. Mirziyoyev attended the Vibrant Gujarat international investment summit as a key guest, being the first Central Asian leader to participate as a partner in the summit. In early 2019, it was announced that Mirziyoyev planned to visit 36 countries in official visits throughout the year.

===Culture policy===
In October 2020, Mirziyoyev issued a decree to accelerate the full Latinization of the Uzbek language that outlined language policy for the 2020–30 period as the country continues an on-again, off-again attempt to reform the Uzbek language and widen its use. Some of the main parts of the degree called on the development of a road map for a full transition to the Uzbek alphabet based on the Latin alphabet, as well as government officials by April 2021 to be certified in their knowledge of Uzbek.

==Personal life==
He has two sisters, a half-brother, and sister. Mirziyoyev is married to Ziroat Mirziyoyeva and has two daughters, a son and six grandchildren. The eldest daughter of Said Mirziyoyev heads the sector for communications and information policy of the executive office of the administration of the head of state. His eldest son-in-law, Oybek Tursunov, is the current head of Mirziyoyev&#x27;s presidential administration, while his younger son-in-law, Otabek Umarov, is the head of the presidential security services.

Since coming to power, Mirziyoyev has built a new residence for himself in Qibray District, which includes his own presidential highway, and an interior that is decorated with Argentinian marble slabs and Swarovski crystals.

In February 2021, it was reported that Mirziyoyev was building an exclusive mountain compound, including a new reservoir. The compound, located about 100 kilometers by car from Tashkent, includes a luxurious mansion built for Mirziyoyev and his relatives. Two sources estimated the cost of the development at several hundred million dollars, though only a handful of publicly available official documents make reference to the compound and the adjacent reservoir, which were largely completed by 2019.

<text>John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, (13 October 16965 August 1743) was an English courtier and political writer. Heir to the Earl of Bristol, he obtained the key patronage of Walpole, and was involved in many court intrigues and literary quarrels, being apparently caricatured by Pope and Fielding. His memoirs of the early reign of George II were too revealing to be published in his time and did not appear for more than a century.

==Family background==
Hervey was the eldest son of John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, by his second wife, Elizabeth. He was known as Lord Hervey from 1723, upon the death of his elder half-brother, Carr, the only son of his father&#x27;s first wife, Isabella, but Lord Hervey never became Earl of Bristol, as he predeceased his father.

==Life==
Hervey was educated at Westminster School and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he took his M.A. degree in 1715. His father then sent him to Paris in 1716, and thence to Hanover to pay court to George I.

He was a frequent visitor at the court of the Prince and Princess of Wales at Richmond, and in 1720 he married Mary Lepell, daughter of Nicholas Lepell, who was one of the Princess&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, and a great court beauty. In 1723 John&#x27;s elder half-brother Carr died, whereby he became heir apparent to the Earldom of Bristol with the courtesy title of &quot;Lord Hervey&quot;. In 1725 he was elected M.P. for Bury St Edmunds.

Hervey had been at one time on very friendly terms with Frederick, Prince of Wales, but in about 1732 they quarrelled, apparently because they were rivals for the affection of Anne Vane. These differences probably account for the scathing picture he draws of the Prince&#x27;s callous conduct. Hervey had been hesitating between William Pulteney (afterwards earl of Bath) and Robert Walpole, but in 1730 he definitely took sides with Walpole, of whom he was thenceforward a faithful adherent. He was assumed by Pulteney to be the author of &quot;Sedition and Defamation display&#x27;d, with a Dedication to the patrons of The Craftsman&quot; (1731). Pulteney, who, up to this time, had been a firm friend of Hervey, replied with &quot;A Proper Reply to a late Scurrilous Libel&quot;, and the quarrel resulted in a duel from which Hervey narrowly escaped with his life.

Hervey is said to have denied the authorship of both the pamphlet and its dedication, but a note on the manuscript at Ickworth, apparently in his own hand, states that he wrote the latter. He was able to render valuable service to Walpole from his influence with the Queen. Through him the minister governed Queen Caroline and indirectly George II. Hervey was vice-chamberlain in the royal household and a member of the Privy Council. In 1733 he was called to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s Barony. He was then elected a governor of the Foundling Hospital prior to its foundation in 1739. In spite of repeated requests he received no further preferment until after 1740, when he became Lord Privy Seal.

After the fall of Sir Robert Walpole, he was dismissed (July 1742) from his office. An excellent political pamphlet, &quot;Miscellaneous Thoughts on the present Posture of Foreign and Domestic Affairs&quot;, shows that he still retained his mental vigour, but he was liable to epilepsy, and his weak appearance and rigid diet were a constant source of ridicule for his enemies. He predeceased his father, but three of his sons became successively Earls of Bristol.

==Memoirs and literary quarrels==
Hervey wrote detailed and brutally frank memoirs of the court of George II of Great Britain from 1727 to 1737. He gave a most unflattering account of the King, and of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and their family squabbles. For the Queen Caroline of Ansbach and her daughter, Princess Caroline of Great Britain, he had genuine respect and attachment. The Princess&#x27;s affection for him was commonly said to be the reason for the close retirement in which she lived after his death. The manuscript of Hervey&#x27;s memoirs was preserved by the family, but his son, Augustus John, 3rd Earl of Bristol, left strict injunctions that they should not be published until after the death of George III. In 1848 they were published under the editorship of J. W. Croker, but the manuscript had been subjected to a certain amount of mutilation before it came into his hands. Croker also softened in some cases the plainspokenness of the original. Hervey&#x27;s account of court life and intrigues resembles in many points the memoirs of Horace Walpole, and the two books corroborate one another in many statements that might otherwise have been received with suspicion.

Until the publication of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; Hervey was chiefly known as the object of savage satire on the part of Alexander Pope, in whose works he figured as Lord Fanny, Sporus, Adonis and Narcissus. The quarrel is generally put down to the Pope&#x27;s jealousy of Hervey&#x27;s friendship with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In the first of the &quot;Imitations of Horace&quot;, addressed to William Fortescue, Lord Fanny and Sappho were generally identified with Hervey and Lady Mary, although Pope denied the personal intention. Hervey had already been attacked in the &quot;Dunciad&quot; and the &quot;Peribathous&quot;, and he now retaliated. There is no doubt that he had a share in the &quot;Verses to the Imitator of Horace&quot; (1732) and it is possible that he was the sole author. In the &quot;Letter from a nobleman at Hampton Court to a Doctor of Divinity&quot; (1733), he scoffed at Pope&#x27;s deformity and humble birth.

Pope&#x27;s reply was a &quot;Letter to a Noble Lord&quot;, dated November 1733, and the portrait of Sporus in the &quot;Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot&quot; (1743), which forms the prologue to the satires. Many of the insinuations and insults contained in it are borrowed from Pulteney&#x27;s &quot;A Proper Reply to a late Scurrilous Libel&quot;.

Some literary critics, such as Martin C. Battestin, suggest that Pope&#x27;s friend and fellow-satirist Henry Fielding intended the character of Beau Didapper in &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; to be read as Hervey. Beau Didapper is described as obedient to the commands of a &quot;Great Man&quot; (presumably Walpole) &quot;which he implicitly submitted to, at the Expence of his Conscience, his Honour, and of his Country.&quot; Didapper is also compared to Hylas, and is mistaken for a woman in the dark on account of his soft skin.

The malicious caricature of Sporus does Hervey great injustice, and he is not much better treated by Horace Walpole, who in reporting his death in a letter (14 August 1743) to Horace Mann, said he had outlived his last inch of character. Nevertheless, his writings prove him to have been a man of real ability, condemned by Walpole&#x27;s tactics and distrust of able men to spend his life in court intrigue, the weapons of which, it must be owned, he used with the utmost adroitness. His wife Lady Hervey (1700–1768), of whom an account is to be found in Lady Louisa Stuart&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes&quot;, was a warm partisan of the Stuarts. She retained her wit and charm throughout her life, and has the distinction of being the recipient of English verses by Voltaire.

==Marriages, affairs, and sexuality==
Hervey married Mary Lepell (1700–1768) on 21 April 1720. They had eight children:

# George William Hervey, 2nd Earl of Bristol (1721–1775), unmarried
# Lepell Hervey (15 April 1723 – 11 May 1780), married in 1743 Constantine John Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave, leaving issue
# Augustus John Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol (1724–1779), died without legitimate issue
# Mary Hervey (1725–1815), married 1747 George FitzGerald, of Turlough, County Mayo, and was the mother of the notoriously eccentric duellist George Robert FitzGerald, hanged for conspiracy to murder in 1786
# Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol (1730–1803), married 1752 Elizabeth Davers, had issue
# General William Hervey (13 May 1732 – 1815), unmarried
# Amelia Caroline Nassau Hervey (1734–1814), unmarried
# Caroline Hervey (1736–1819), unmarried

Hervey was bisexual. He had an affair with Anne Vane, and possibly with Lady Townshend, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Princess Caroline. He lived with Stephen Fox often during the decade after he followed him to Italy in 1728. He wrote passionate love letters to Francesco Algarotti, whom he first met in 1736. He may have had a sexual affair with Prince Frederick before their friendship dissolved. He was in fact denounced as a sexually ambiguous figure in his time most notably by William Pulteney, then leader of the Opposition and as cited above, by Alexander Pope in his &quot;Sporus&quot; portrait: &quot;Let Sporus tremble/What that thing of silk...His wit all seesaw between that and this/Now high, now low, now master up, now miss/And he himself one vile antithesis...&quot;. He was also attracted to Henry Fox before his affair with Stephen Fox.

==Writings==
See Hervey&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Court of George II&quot;, edited by John Wilson Croker (1848); and an article by G. F. Russell Barker in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. Besides the &quot;Memoirs&quot; he wrote numerous political pamphlets, and some occasional verses.

==Modern portrayals==
Hervey appears as a character in the 1999 British television series &quot;Aristocrats&quot;, where he is portrayed by Anthony Finigan. He is shown acting as a patron to the younger Henry Fox.

Hervey appears as a character in the historical novel &quot;Peter: The Untold True Story&quot; (2013) by Christopher Mechling, a tale of 18th-century feral child Peter the Wild Boy, whom the author believes to have been the inspiration for Peter Pan.

<text>The 1951 Irish general election to the 14th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 30 May following the dissolution of the 13th Dáil on 7 May by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly on the request of Taoiseach John A. Costello. The general election took place in 40 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 147 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas.

This election was the first election since the declaration of the Republic of Ireland on 18 April 1949 under the terms of The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which forced Ireland&#x27;s withdrawal from the British Commonwealth.

The 14th Dáil met at Leinster House on 13 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Costello failed to secure a majority, and Éamon de Valera was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 6th government of Ireland, a single-party minority Fianna Fáil government.

==Campaign==
The 1951 general election was caused by a number of crises within the first inter-party government, most notably the Mother and Child Scheme. While the affair – which saw the resignation of the Minister for Health, Noël Browne – was not entirely to blame for the collapse of the government, it added to the disagreement between the various political parties. There were other problems facing the country, such as rising prices and balance-of-payments problems. Two farmer TDs withdrew their support for the government because of rising milk prices.

The coalition parties fought the general election on their record over the previous three years, while Fianna Fáil argued strongly against coalition governments.

==Government formation==
The election result was inconclusive. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s support increased by 61,000 votes; however, the party only gained one additional seat. The coalition parties had mixed fortunes. Fine Gael were the big winners increasing to forty seats. The Labour Party had reunited in 1950, when the National Labour Party had merged back into the party but in spite of this, the party lost seats. Clann na Poblachta was the big loser of the election. Three years earlier the party had been a big political threat but now the party was shattered.

Fianna Fáil did not have enough seats to govern alone. However, the party was able to form a minority government with the support of Noël Browne, the sacked Minister for Health, and other Independent deputies.

<doc id="399862" wikidata="Q1349866" url="?curid=399862" title="John Cassin">
<text>John Cassin (September 6, 1813 – January 10, 1869) was an American ornithologist from Pennsylvania. He worked as curator and vice president at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and focused on the systemic classification of the academy&#x27;s extensive collection of birds. He was one of the founders of the Delaware County Institute of Science and published several books describing 194 new species of birds. Five species of North American birds, a cicada, and a mineral are named in his honor.

==Early life and education==
Cassin was born in Upper Providence Township, Pennsylvania on September 6, 1813. 
He was educated at the Westtown School in Westtown Township, Pennsylvania. His great Uncle, John Cassin, was a commodore in the U.S. Navy and served in the War of 1812.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was held prisoner in the infamous Confederate Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia.

==Career==
Cassin moved to Philadelphia in 1834 and became the head of a lithographing business in which many of his illustrations of birds were later printed. He served for a brief time in the Philadelphia City Council. He was a member of the Zoological Society, the American Philosophical Society and the Pennsylvania Historical Society.

In 1833, Cassin, along with 4 colleagues, founded the Delaware County Institute of Science in Media, Pennsylvania.

In 1842, he was elected curator of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. From 1846 to 1850, Thomas Bellerby Wilson, a wealthy patron of the academy, became interested in the department of ornithology and procured a collection of over 25,000 birds. The academy had the largest ornithological collection in the United States at the time and included an extensive collection of non-North American species. This exceptional collection of birds allowed Cassin to become the leading ornithological taxonomist in the world.

Cassin worked almost exclusively at the academy, focused on research and the systematic classification of species rather than field work. He described 194 new species of birds and revised a number of families in the academy&#x27;s publications. His publications include &quot;Birds of California&quot;, with descriptions and colored engravings of fifty species; &quot;Synopsis of the Birds of North America&quot;; &quot;Ornithology of the United States Exploring Expedition&quot;; &quot;Ornithology of the Japan Expedition&quot;; &quot;Ornithology of Gillis&#x27;s Astronomical Expedition to Chile&quot;; and chapters on raptorial birds and waders in &quot;Ornithology of the Pacific Railroad Explorations and Surveys&quot;. He also co-authored &quot;Birds of North America&quot; (1860) with Spencer Fullerton Baird and George Newbold Lawrence.
Specimens collected from the Pacific Railroad Surveys and the Mexican Boundary Surveys were sent to the academy and further supplemented the collection. Cassin helped revise the publications that arose from these surveys.

Martha Maxwell was a student of Cassin at the Academy of Natural Sciences from 1862 to 1869.

Cassin was elected vice president of the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1864.

He died in 1869 of arsenic poisoning caused by his handling of bird skins preserved with arsenic. His collection of 4,300 birds was purchased for $500, dollars, by John Whipple Potter Jenks for Brown University&#x27;s museum of natural history.

He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==

Five birds from North America are named in his honor: the Cassin&#x27;s auklet, Cassin&#x27;s kingbird, Cassin&#x27;s vireo, Cassin&#x27;s sparrow, and Cassin&#x27;s finch. The periodic cicada &quot;Magicicada cassini &quot; and the mineral orthoclase variety cassinite are also named for him.

In 1901, the journal of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club was renamed Cassinia in his honor.

<doc id="399863" wikidata="Q6239112" url="?curid=399863" title="John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol">
<text>John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol (27 August 1665 – 20 January 1751) was an English Whig politician.

John Hervey was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the son of Sir Thomas Hervey. He was educated in Bury and at Clare College, Cambridge. He became one of the two Members of Parliament for the town five years after his father in March 1694.

In March 1703 he was created 1st Baron Hervey, of Ickworth in the county of Suffolk, and in October 1714 was created 1st Earl of Bristol as a reward for his zeal in promoting the principles of the revolution and supporting the Hanoverian succession.

==Estates==
The principal estate owned by John Hervey was Ickworth, which his ancestor Thomas Hervey (died 1467) acquired following his marriage to Jane Drury, the sole heiress to Henry Drury. However, when he married Elizabeth Felton, he acquired property in other parts of Suffolk: Tuddenham, Playford and Shotley following the death of her father Sir Thomas Felton, 4th Baronet in 1709.

==Marriages and issue==
Lord Bristol married twice:
*to Isabella (died 1693), daughter of Sir Robert Carr, 3rd Baronet, of Sleaford, Lincolnshire
* 25 July 1695, Boxted Hall in Suffolk, to Elizabeth (died 1741), daughter and co-heir of local Suffolk dignitary Sir Thomas Felton, 4th Baronet and his noble wife styled from birth Lady Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk.

By his marriage to Isabella he had three children:
* Isabella Hervey (died November 1711), unmarried
* Carr Hervey, Lord Hervey (1691–1723), who was educated at Clare College, Cambridge and was an MP for the same seat as his father and grandfather from 1713 to 1722. He died unmarried on 14 November 1723.
* Catherine Hervey (b. 1693), died young

By his marriage to Lady Elizabeth he had seventeen children:
* Lady Elizabeth Hervey (1698–1727), married Bussy Mansel, without issue
* John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey (1696–1743), was a politician, court wit and pamphleteer. On the death of his half-brother Carr in 1723 he took the courtesy title of Lord Hervey and gained some renown both as a writer and in politics. In 1733, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Hervey. He also predeceased his father.
* Thomas Hervey (20 January 1699 – 16 January 1775), was one of the members for Bury from 1733 to 1747; held various offices at court; and eloped with Elizabeth, wife of Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet. He had very poor health, and his reckless life frequently brought him into pecuniary and other difficulties. He wrote numerous pamphlets, and when he died Dr. Johnson said of him, &quot;Tom Hervey, though a vicious man [ie a man of vice], was one of the genteelest men who ever lived&quot;.

* Capt. William Hervey, RN (25 December 1699 – January 1776), married Elizabeth Ridge and had issue

<text>N&quot;-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, also known asNSFor N&quot;-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion proteins, is an enzyme which in humans is encoded by the &quot;NSF&quot; gene.

== Function ==

NSF is a homohexameric AAA ATPase involved in membrane fusion. NSF is ubiquitously found in the membrane of eukaryotic cells. It is a central component of the cellular machinery in the transfer of membrane vesicles from one membrane compartment to another. During this process, SNARE proteins on two joining membranes (usually a vesicle and a target membrane such as the plasma membrane) form a complex, with the α-helical domains of the SNAREs coiling around each other and forming a very stable four-helix bundle. As SNAREs intertwine, they pull the vesicle towards the target membrane, excluding water and promoting fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane. NSF unravels SNARE complexes once membrane fusion has occurred, using the hydrolysis of ATP as an energy source, allowing the dissociated SNAREs to be recycled for reuse in further rounds of membrane fusion. This proposal remains controversial, however. Recent work indicates that the ATPase function of NSF does not function in recycling of vesicles but rather functions in the act of fusing vesicles with the plasma membrane.

== SNARE hypothesis ==

Because neuronal function depends on the release of neurotransmitters at a synapse — a process in which synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane — NSF is a key synaptic component. Thus, conditional temperature-sensitive mutations in the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; gene for NSF lead to a comatose behaviour at the restrictive temperature (and hence the gene is called comatose), presumably because neuronal functions are blocked. In &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; amoebae, similar mutations lead to a cessation of cell movement at the restrictive temperature, indicating a role for intracellular membrane transport in migration. Another neuronal role for NSF is indicated by its direct binding to the GluR2 subunit of AMPA type glutamate receptors (which detect the neurotransmitter glutamate). This gives NSF a putative role in delivery and expression of AMPA receptors at the synapse.

NSF was discovered by James Rothman and colleagues in 1987 while at Stanford University; they identified NSF after observing that a cytoplasmic factor, required for membrane fusions, was inactivated by treatment with &quot;N&quot;-ethylmaleimide. This assay enabled them to purify NSF.

== Interactions ==

&quot;N&quot;-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein has been shown to interact with NAPA.

<text>Célestin Leroy Gaombalet (1 January 1942 – 19 December 2017) was a Central African politician who was Prime Minister of the Central African Republic from 2003 to 2005. He was President of the National Assembly of the Central African Republic from 2005 to 2013.

==Biography==
Gaombalet was born in the village of Grimari in 1942. He began working for the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) in the 1970s, then became Director-General of the Union Bank in Central Africa, located in Bangui, before being dismissed from that post by President André Kolingba in 1981. Kolingba moved Gaombalet to a position at the Development Bank of Central African States in Brazzaville. In the early 1990s, Gaombalet returned to the Central African Republic, becoming head of the Moroccan-Central African People&#x27;s Bank and later retiring.

Despite having no political experience, Gaombalet was appointed as prime minister by President François Bozizé on December 12, 2003, replacing Abel Goumba, who in turn became Bozizé&#x27;s vice-president. In a reshuffle of the government on September 2, 2004, Gaombalet remained prime minister while the number of ministers was reduced to 24 from the previous 28; Gaombalet said that this did not affect the political balance and that it was necessary to save money. In the 2005 parliamentary election, Gaombalet was elected to the National Assembly as a Deputy from Bambari. At the opening of the National Assembly, he was elected as President of the National Assembly on June 7, 2005, receiving 78 votes against 18 for Luc Apollinaire Dondon Konamabaye, who had previously held the position under President Ange-Félix Patassé. Gaombalet resigned as prime minister on June 11 and was replaced by Élie Doté on June 13.

In the January–March 2011 parliamentary election, Gaombalet was re-elected to the National Assembly; when the legislature began sitting for its new term, he was re-elected as President of the National Assembly.

<doc id="399870" wikidata="Q738439" url="?curid=399870" title="Croatian Democratic Union">
<text>The Croatian Democratic Union (, , HDZ) is a major conservative, centre-right political party in Croatia. Since 2016, it has been the ruling political party in Croatia under the incumbent Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. It is one of the two major contemporary political parties in Croatia, along with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP). It is currently the largest party in the Sabor with 55 seats. The HDZ governed Croatia from 1990 before the country gained independence from Yugoslavia until 2000 and, in coalition with junior partners, from 2003 to 2011, and since 2016. HDZ is a member of the Centrist Democrat International, International Democracy Union, and the European People&#x27;s Party, and sits in the European People&#x27;s Party Group in the European Parliament. HDZ is the first political party in Croatia to be convicted of corruption.

==History==
===Origins===
The HDZ was founded on 17 June 1989 by Croatian dissidents led by Franjo Tuđman. It was officially registered on 25 January 1990. The HDZ held its first convention on 24–25 February 1990, when Franjo Tuđman was elected its president. When the party was founded, the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia had just introduced a multi-party system in Croatia and scheduled elections for the Croatian Parliament.

The HDZ began as a nationalist party but also included former partisans and members of the Communist establishment, such as Josip Manolić and Josip Boljkovac. President Tuđman and other HDZ officials traveled abroad and gathered large financial contributions from Croatian expatriates. On the eve of the 1990 parliamentary elections, the ruling League of Communists of Croatia saw such tendencies within the HDZ as an opportunity to remain in power. At the beginning of democracy the communists called HDZ &quot;the party of dangerous intentions&quot;. The HDZ won a majority in the Croatian Parliament, and Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia) became one of the few socialist countries where Communist single party rule was replaced by anti-Communist single party rule. 30 May 1990, the day the HDZ formally took power, was celebrated as Statehood Day.

===1990–2000===
A presidential election was held in 1992, and Tuđman, who would remain as undisputed party leader until his death in 1999, was elected president.

The party governed Croatia throughout the 1990s and under its leadership, Croatia became independent (1991), was internationally recognized (1992), and consolidated all of its pre-war territory (by 1998). During that period, the HDZ won both the 1992 and 1995 parliamentary elections.

As it strongly advocated Croatian independence, the HDZ was quite unpopular with the Serb minority and others who preferred to see Croatia remain inside the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This was one of the factors contributing to the creation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the subsequent armed conflict in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The role of the HDZ in those events is matter of controversy, even in Croatia, where some tend to view HDZ policy in the early stages of the conflict as extremist and a contributing factor in the escalation of violence while others (such as Marko Veselica&#x27;s Croatian Democratic Party) see the HDZ as having appeased Serbia and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, therefore being responsible for Croatia&#x27;s unpreparedness for defense. However, the policies of Tuđman and the HDZ shifted according to the circumstances.

=== Transition to capitalism ===

The HDZ also began to lead Croatia toward a political and economic transition from socialism to capitalism. Notably, HDZ governments implemented privatization in the country in a manner that critics consider sub-optimal, and at times possibly illegal, due to the selective nature of the privatizations (see Croatian privatization controversy). According to the HDZ, this process proved a useful distraction from dealing with the baggage of post-World War II communist nationalizations. It was the HDZ in 1992 which enacted into law the right of corporations (the vast majority of which were under state ownership) the right to finally formally register themselves as the owners of nationalized property, thus completing their version of a process of quasi-nationalization started by the communist regime after WWII, in different targeted areas for their gain. Property returned included possessions nationalized from the Catholic Church or widely known individuals such as Gavrilović, the owner of a major meat-producing factory in Petrinja, south of Zagreb.

===HDZ after Tuđman&#x27;s death===
The 2000 parliamentary elections were held 3 January, weeks after Tuđman&#x27;s death. The HDZ was defeated by a centre-left coalition of six opposition parties, led by Ivica Račan&#x27;s Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Dražen Budiša&#x27;s Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS). The election was seen as a referendum on the HDZ with a poor economy, corruption and crony capitalism being major factors in their ouster. 

At the subsequent presidential election, HDZ candidate Mate Granić who was favored to win in the weeks prior to the parliamentary elections, finished third and therefore failed to enter the second round of voting, won by Stipe Mesić.

In the period from 2000 and 2003, several businessmen who became tycoons under the initial HDZ rule were tried and convicted for abuses, though in general the privatization process implemented by the HDZ remained unaltered. This period proved to be a low point for the HDZ; many thought the party could not recover. These people included Mate Granić, who, together with Vesna Škare-Ožbolt, left to form the centre-right Democratic Centre (DC).

When the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTY) began to prosecute Croatian Army commanders, this provoked a major backlash among the Croatian public. As the opposition party, the HDZ supported this popular discontent and actively resisted the transfers of generals to the ICTY. This gradually changed as the HDZ and its new leader Ivo Sanader began to distance themselves from the more extreme rhetoric, becoming perceived as moderates. This tendency continued when the HSLS shifted rightwards, making Sanader&#x27;s HDZ and HSLS appear as like-oriented parties. This process was completed in 2002 when Ivić Pašalić, leader of the HDZ hardliners and perceived to be associated with the worst excesses of Tuđman&#x27;s era, challenged Sanader for the party leadership, accusing him of betraying Tuđman&#x27;s nationalist legacy. At first it looked like Sanader would lose, but with the help of Branimir Glavaš and the tacit support of liberal sections of Croatian public opinion, he won at the party convention. Pašalić then left the HDZ to form the Croatian Bloc party.

===First Sanader government (2003–2008)===

At the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election, the party won 33.9% of the popular vote and 66 out of 152 seats. Although it failed to win a clear majority in the Croatian Parliament, even with the help of the allied DC and HSLS, it formed a government with the nominally left-wing Independent Democratic Serb Party and the Croatian Party of Pensioners.

With such a broad and diverse mandate, the Sanader-led government vigorously pursued policies that amounted to the implementation of the basic criteria for joining the European Union, such as the return of refugees to their homes, rebuilding houses damaged in the war, improving minority rights, cooperating with the ICTY, and continuing to consolidate the Croatian economy. Despite this, the EU&#x27;s Council of Ministers postponed Croatia&#x27;s membership negotiations with the union on the grounds of its non-cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia over the case of indicted general Ante Gotovina.

This setback brought an increase in Eurosceptic views among the Croatian public, which also affected support for the HDZ. Since accession to the EU was a key part of Sanader&#x27;s reformist course, opposition to his leadership within and outside the HDZ was on the rise. This opposition manifested itself at the 2005 local elections and the defection of Glavaš, who not only successfully challenged Sanader&#x27;s authority but also managed to nominally deprive Sanader of his parliamentary majority.

===Second Sanader government (2008–2009)===
Despite this defeat, the first Sanader-led government was able to survive until the end of the legislature. The subsequent parliamentary election in late November 2007 saw the HDZ hard-pressed both by the SDP-led leftist coalition and by the extreme right-wing Croatian Party of Rights and Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja.

During the electoral campaign, a vigorous and sometimes ruthless reaction from the party and Sanader himself, together with some capital errors from SDP, convinced part of the far-right electorate to support the HDZ to prevent what they perceived as the heirs of the former communist party to return to power. The party won a majority of both seats and votes in the election, and the first session of the newly elected parliament was called for 11 January 2008. However, the SDP repeatedly refused to acknowledge defeat, claiming that they had the most votes if the diaspora ballot was not taken into account. The HDZ gained the support of the &quot;yellow–green coalition&quot; (HSS-HSLS) and of the HSU and national minorities representatives; Sanader formed a second government.

In the local elections held in May 2009, the HDZ, against all expectations, managed to grow again, coming ahead of the SDP. However, HDZ support did weaken in the larger cities.

On 1 July 2009, Ivo Sanader abruptly announced his resignation from politics and appointed Jadranka Kosor as his successor. She was confirmed as the new leader of the party on 3 July and was appointed by president Stipe Mesić as the prime minister-designate. Two days later the Sabor confirmed Kosor as the new prime minister, the first woman to hold the position.

In the same resignation speech, Sanader also appointed Andrija Hebrang, who had formerly held the posts of defence minister and health minister, as HDZ candidate for the incoming presidential election, decreasing any speculation about his own ambitions for that position.

The &quot;Fimi media&quot; was a corruption scandal which resulted from former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader stealing money from the state budget. USKOK has charged former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, Fimi media CEO Nevenka Jurak, former treasurer of the Croatian Democratic Union Mladen Barišić, former spokesperson of the Croatian Democratic Union Ratko Maček and former chief accountant Branka Pavošević with damaging the state budget by 70 million kuna or approximately 9 million euros.

===Government of Jadranka Kosor===
The HDZ was faced with bad poll ratings and a large clean-up task that was still underway when Sanader left. The officials used the 2009 convention to elect Jadranka Kosor party president by acclamation. Andrija Hebrang accepted his designation as the presidential candidate only at the end of July, after he underwent a thorough medical examination, to exclude any remaining trace of a previous carcinoma.

The Kosor government remained mostly unchanged from the previous Sanader government, but the HDZ suffered some internal turmoil as ministers Berislav Rončević and Damir Polančec left their posts after allegations of corruption. Along with several anti-corruption investigations, the party had to deal with an economic crisis. It began tackling the issue in April 2010 with a recovery program.

In the next presidential elections, Croatia was looking for a replacement for Stipe Mesić who had held the position for ten years. But Hebrang finished third, failing to reach the second stage in which SDP candidate Ivo Josipović overwhelmingly defeated former SDP member Milan Bandić.

However, many Croatian people were dissatisfied with the government and protested on the streets against the HDZ government, demanding that new elections be held as soon as possible. The police placed a guard on St. Mark&#x27;s Square to prevent civilians from entering.

From 26 October 2011 USKOK expanded its investigation about &quot;Slush Funds&quot; on the HDZ as a legal entity. Previously, the investigation had included only Ivo Sanader, treasurers Milan Barišić and Branka Pavošević, general secretaries Branko Vukelić and Ivan Jarnjak and spokesman Ratko Maček. Party president Jadranka Kosor stated that this was one of the most critical moments of the HDZ. The HDZ became the first political party in Croatia to be charged with corruption.

===In the opposition===

After the 2011 parliamentary elections, the HDZ became the opposition after 8 years in government. The HDZ won its smallest number of votes since its founding, 563,215.

On 20 May 2012, HDZ held a presidential election in which, a day later, Tomislav Karamarko become the winner and thus replaced Kosor as leader of the opposition. Karamarko announced that he would reestablish connections between Croatia and the Croatian diaspora.

Karamarko earlier announced that, after a process of the detudjmanization of the HDZ, he would return to the policies of Franjo Tuđman. He also stated that he could be &quot;neither for Ante Pavelić nor Josip Broz Tito&quot;, as both of them represented totalitarian systems. On 1 July 2013, HDZ received full member status of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). On 11 March 2014, the HDZ and Ivo Sanader were found guilty of corruption.

===Plenković government (2016–present)===
Following the collapse of the Tihomir Orešković government in June 2016, Tomislav Karamarko resigned as HDZ leader. The party elected former diplomat and member of the European Parliament Andrej Plenković as the new president, who won on a policy platform &quot;devoid of extremes and populism&quot;. Plenković won the 2016 parliamentary election, in which he campaigned on a pro-European and moderate agenda. Plenković was appointed prime minister in October.

==Ideology==

In terms of ideology, the HDZ statute, as well as its President Andrej Plenković and Secretary Gordan Jandroković, define the political position of the party as centre-right. However, there have been significant shifts in HDZ&#x27;s ideological and political positions, and there are both moderate and right-wing factions within the party with different interpretations of its basic positions.

The HDZ leaders during the 1990s described their party as centrist and Christian-democratic, although in practice they pursued ultranationalistic policies. However, the party was at the time mostly characterized as further to the right than in recent years. 

At its beginning, the HDZ was an ethnically exclusive party that emphasized Croatian identity. Slogans such as &quot;God and Croats&quot; and &quot;Croats get together&quot; were common, which were incidentally also used by the leaders of the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia. Its discourse had a strong emotional appeal, evoking &quot;fears, desires, material and symbolic benefits&quot; to win over those who sought Croatian sovereignty over communism and drawing upon Croatian nationalist traditions. It did not recognize the plurality of identities when addressing its citizens, viewing them as &quot;Catholic Croats&quot; with anti-Serbian sentiments regularly appearing during its assemblies.
The HDZ&#x27;s position regarding the European Union was soft Eurosceptic: there was no explicit opposition to the accession of Croatia to the EU, but the HDZ opposed some EU policies. Following the election of Ivo Sanader as the party president in 2000, the HDZ adopted a moderate centre-right position. Under Sanader, the party strongly pursued a pro-European policy, which continued under the leadership of Jadranka Kosor. Many observers considered the leadership of Tomislav Karamarko from 2012 to 2016 as a return of nationalism in the party. After Andrej Plenković, viewed as a moderate, came to power in 2016, the party moved back to a centre-right position. The HDZ has been described as Christian-democratic and pro-European. The HDZ is responsible for implementing the &quot;femicide&quot; law, which criminalizes the killing of women, usually by men, because of their gender. This makes Croatia the third country in Europe to have &quot;femicide&quot; as part of its law.

<doc id="399872" wikidata="Q4786639" url="?curid=399872" title="Archie Cameron">
<text>Archie Galbraith Cameron (22 March 18959 August 1956) was an Australian politician. He was a government minister under Joseph Lyons and Robert Menzies, leader of the Country Party from 1939 to 1940, and finally Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1950 until his death.

Cameron was born in Happy Valley, South Australia. After serving in World War I, he took up a farm near Loxton as a soldier settler. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly in 1927, and to the House of Representatives at the 1934 federal election. Cameron was Postmaster-General in the Lyons government from 1938 to 1939. He replaced Earle Page as leader of the Country Party in September 1939, and in March 1940 led the party back into coalition with the United Australia Party (UAP), which Page had broken off. Cameron was &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister under Menzies, as well as Minister for Commerce and Minister for the Navy. However, he was deposed as Country Party leader in October 1940, subsequently defecting to the UAP (and later joining the new Liberal Party). Cameron&#x27;s last appointment was as Speaker, where he was highly respected. He was known throughout his political career for his eccentric manner and strong personality.

==Early life==
Cameron was born in Happy Valley, South Australia, the son of Mary Ann (née McDonald) and John Cameron. His parents were both immigrants from Scotland. He was educated at state schools and worked on his father&#x27;s farm at Happy Valley until 1916, when he joined the First Australian Imperial Force and fought on the Western Front. He was gassed while in the front, suffering severe damage to his heart and lungs. After World War I Cameron took up farming near Loxton as part of a soldier settlement scheme, and became active in the newly formed Country Party.

==State politics==
An early member of the Country Party, Cameron unsuccessfully stood for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Wooroora at the 1924 state election. He reprised his candidacy in Wooroora at the 1927 state election and was elected.

Cameron was elected state leader of the Country Party in 1928. Prior to the 1931 federal election he was involved in the formation of the Emergency Committee of South Australia as a united anti-Labor party. In 1932 he led his party into a merger with the Liberal Federation to form the Liberal and Country League. The Country Party&#x27;s terms were stiff; among them, Cameron sought to transfer to federal politics, and wanted a safe seat in which to run at the next election. Accordingly, Cameron resigned from state parliament in 1934 in order to run in that year&#x27;s federal election.

==Federal politics==
===Early years===
Cameron was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1934 federal election, standing as the LCL candidate in the seat of Barker. He joined the parliamentary Country Party upon his election, in accordance with LCL rules which allowed their federal MPs to choose to sit with either the Country Party or the United Australia Party (UAP). Shortly after taking his seat he moved a motion to expel Lang Labor MP Jock Garden from parliament for his former Communist affiliation, which caused a &quot;near-riot&quot;.

Cameron did not have long to wait for ministerial preferment; in 1937 he was appointed an assistant minister in the government of Joseph Lyons. In November 1937, Cameron stood for the deputy leadership of the Country Party following the retirement of Thomas Paterson; he did not win enough votes to make the second ballot. He briefly served as acting minister for commerce in 1938, and during that time became the first minister to be &quot;named&quot; by the Speaker. Later that year, he became Postmaster-General. He temporarily suspended radio 2KY&#x27;s licence because he objected to political views expressed on it (2KY was the property of the ALP&#x27;s New South Wales branch).

===Leader of the Country Party===

Cameron was elected leader of the Country Party on 13 September 1939, following the resignation of Earle Page. He defeated John McEwen by seven votes to five, with two abstentions. According to McEwen, the result was skewed by the absence of four MPs who had refused to sit with the Country Party with Page as leader – a motion to re-admit them was defeated by seven votes to six. McEwen claimed in his memoirs that the dissident MPs were &quot;all strong supporters of mine and, had they been allowed to vote, I would have won the election&quot;. They were all re-admitted to the party a few months later.

In March 1940, Cameron took the Country Party back into the coalition government under Menzies, becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister as well as Minister for Commerce and Minister for the Navy. The Country Party lost three seats to Labor 1940 election, costing the Coalition its majority. Country Party MPs tired of Cameron&#x27;s domineering style, and removed him as leader. Arthur Fadden was chosen as interim leader and after Page and McEwen deadlocked on three ballots. Cameron then immediately resigned from the ministry, and from the Country Party: he joined Menzies&#x27;s party, the United Australia Party. He rejoined the Army and spent the rest of the war on active service in the Directorate of Military Intelligence at Army Headquarters, Melbourne, where he did useful work on the Japanese order of battle. While he was in the service, he faced what would be his only really close electoral contest. At the 1943 election, trade unionist Harry Krantz slashed Cameron&#x27;s majority from a comfortably safe 15.9 percent to an extremely marginal 1.7 percent. Cameron was left as the only non-Labor MP from South Australia, and the only non-Labor member outside the eastern states (the member for Northern Territory, Adair Blain, was an independent, but did not have full voting rights).

During World War II, Cameron was a strong supporter of mass internment of enemy aliens. In November 1940, shortly after his resignation from the ministry, the Australian War Cabinet decided to allow interned aliens the right to appeal their internment to a tribunal. While remaining a government backbencher, Cameron unsuccessfully moved for the disallowance of the relevant regulation by the House of Representatives and in April 1941 moved a no-confidence motion in the army minister Percy Spender for his handling of internment. Cameron argued that enemy aliens &quot;enjoy no rights whatever&quot; during war-time and were a &quot;danger to the nation&quot; unless proven otherwise, with the appeals tribunals placing the government &quot;in the hopelessly ridiculous position of appearing before a tribunal to defend its own actions&quot;. His motion was not put to a vote as no other MP was willing to second it, but in response Spender defended his actions and stated Cameron&#x27;s intent was to &quot;indulge his peculiar megalomania in order to get some notoriety out of his action&quot;.

===Speaker of the House of Representatives===
Cameron followed most of the UAP into Menzies&#x27;s new party, the Liberal Party, and when the Liberals won the 1949 elections Menzies appointed him Speaker of the House: mainly, it was said, to keep him out of the Cabinet. He presided over the House with an autocratic style that caused a number of celebrated rows with members on both sides. Cameron&#x27;s health never recovered from his World War I gassing, and in August 1955 he contracted influenza. Despite this, he fought that year&#x27;s election and was handily reelected. He died of a heart attack in August in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney.

==Personal life==
Cameron married Margaret Eileen Walsh on 15 April 1925. They had a son and a daughter together; his daughter predeceased him.

Cameron was raised Presbyterian, but later converted to Catholicism, which was his wife&#x27;s religion. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported in 1950 that he was a &quot;deeply religious man&quot;. In parliament, he attracted attention for choosing to make an affirmation rather than swear the oath of office. He did so each time he was elected and was the only member of the House of Representatives to do so during his time in office; after his death no other MPs chose to make an affirmation until 1969. He told an interviewer that &quot;if a man&#x27;s word is worthless no amount of oath-taking will make him worthy&quot;.

<text>George William Hervey, 2nd Earl of Bristol (3 August 1721 – 18/20 March 1775) was an English diplomat and politician who was the eldest son of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, by his marriage with Mary Hervey.

Lord Bristol served for some years in the British Army, and in 1755 was sent to Turin as envoy extraordinary. He was ambassador at Madrid from 1758 to 1761, filling a difficult position with credit and dignity, and ranked among the followers of William Pitt the Elder.

Appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1766, he never visited that country during his short tenure of this office, and, after having served for a short time as keeper of the Privy Seal, became Groom of the Stool to George III in January 1770. He died unmarried, despite a youthful flirtation with the Lady Townshend, and was succeeded by his brother.

<doc id="399875" wikidata="Q429424" url="?curid=399875" title="Bob Griese">
<text>Robert Allen Griese ( ; born February 3, 1945) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for the Miami Dolphins of the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He earned All-American honors playing college football with the Purdue Boilermakers before being drafted in 1967 by the Dolphins of the AFL.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of the 1970s, Griese led the Dolphins to a then record three consecutive Super Bowl appearances, including two Super Bowl victories in VII and VIII, the first of which capped off Miami&#x27;s undefeated and untied 1972 season, the only such season in NFL history. Griese was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. He later worked as a television commentator, calling NFL games for NBC Sports and college football for ESPN and ABC Sports. Griese is one of three quarterbacks from Purdue to win the Super Bowl (along with Len Dawson and Drew Brees).

==Early life==
Griese was born in Evansville, Indiana, to Ida (Ulrich) and Sylverious &quot;Slick&quot; Griese. Slick owned a plumbing company in Evansville and died in 1955 when Bob was ten years old. Bob played baseball primarily, and excelled as a pitcher. He also starred in basketball and football at Evansville&#x27;s Rex Mundi High School. He earned 12 varsity letters for the Monarchs.

===Baseball===
In the summer of 1963, Griese led his American Legion Baseball team, Funkhouser Post #8 of Evansville, Indiana, to the American Legion Baseball World Series as the Region 5 champion. His team did not reach the finals, as the Arthur L. Peterson Post of Long Beach, California, won the title.

===Basketball===
He led the basketball team to the No. 1 ranking in Indiana during the 1962–63 season and a record of 19–3. He scored 900 points in his high school career and while being named All-Sectional, he could not lead the Monarchs past Evansville Bosse in the highly competitive Evansville IHSAA Sectional.

===Football===
The Monarchs were 15–5 during his Junior (9–1) and Senior (6–4) seasons, as he was named 1st Team All-City for three seasons. After being recruited by several colleges for football, Bob chose Purdue, where he majored in management (Krannert School of Management) and became a three-sport star.

==College career==

While at Purdue, Bob became a member of Sigma Chi fraternity.

Griese pitched for the Purdue baseball team, going 12–1 one season, played guard on the Purdue basketball team, and played quarterback, kicker, and punter for the Purdue football team. There are at least four football games in which Griese was in some way responsible for all of Purdue&#x27;s points.

As of the beginning of the 2016 NCAA football season, Griese ranks #10 in all-time scoring at Purdue; #5 in scoring among non-kickers and #4 among kickers. Griese&#x27;s passing skills greatly improved under the tutelage of head coach Jack Mollenkopf and quarterback coach Bob DeMoss.

In his junior year at Purdue in a game against the top-ranked Notre Dame, Griese completed 19 of 22 passes as he led the Boilermakers to an upset win.

Griese was a two-time All-American at Purdue, finishing at No. 8 in the 1965 Heisman Trophy race and was the runner-up to Steve Spurrier for the 1966 Heisman Trophy. Purdue finished second in the Big Ten in 1966, and he led the school&#x27;s first appearance in the Rose Bowl, where they defeated USC 14–13. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1992. He was also awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor for excellence in athletics and academics.

Griese&#x27;s achievements during his college career earned him induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984. Purdue does not have a practice of retiring jersey numbers, but he was inducted as an inaugural member of the Purdue Intercollegiate Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.

On December 11, 2014, the Big Ten Network included Griese on &quot;The Mount Rushmore of Purdue Football&quot;, as chosen by online fan voting. Griese was joined in the honor by Drew Brees, Rod Woodson and Leroy Keyes.

==Professional career==

===1967–1969===
Griese was selected by the AFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins as the fourth player in the 1967 Common Draft. Griese threw for 2,005 yards and 15 touchdowns his rookie year.

Griese was an AFL All-Star his first two years with the Dolphins, and earned AFL All-Star or AFC-NFC Pro Bowl honors in six additional seasons. While he never put up huge numbers, his leadership played an important role in helping the Dolphins compete in three consecutive Super Bowls, winning the latter two contests.

Griese started the season as the team&#x27;s second-string quarterback behind John Stofa. When Stofa broke his ankle in the first quarter of the first game of the 1967 season, Griese stepped in and led the Dolphins to a 35–21 victory against the Denver Broncos. The 1967, 1968, and 1969 seasons were tough for the expansion Dolphins. After a difficult 1969 season that was worse than the 1968 season, coach George Wilson was fired.

===1970–1976===
Dolphin owner Joe Robbie brought in Don Shula from the Baltimore Colts in 1970, and the team&#x27;s personality and fortunes turned quickly. The Dolphins found a new discipline, and learned what it took to become a winning team. They went from a 3–10–1 record in 1969 to 10–4 in 1970, making the playoffs.

In 1971 the Dolphins made it to the Super Bowl, losing 24–3 to the Dallas Cowboys. Griese was named the 1971 Newspaper Enterprise Association NFL Most Valuable Player award, and was awarded the Jim Thorpe Trophy.

The 1972 season began with the Dolphins winning their first four games. In the fifth game of the season, Bob Griese was tackled hard by Deacon Jones and Ron East of the San Diego Chargers, and went down with a broken leg and dislocated ankle. Earl Morrall, fresh off the waiver wire from Shula&#x27;s former team, the Baltimore Colts, guided the Dolphins through the rest of the regular season, and maintained an unbeaten record in the process. Morrall also led the NFL in five passing categories during this time, including passer rating. As the playoffs began, the Dolphins were not as strong as they needed to be to go deep into the postseason, barely winning against the Cleveland Browns, a team that they should have beaten easily. The second game of the playoffs the team got off to a slow start against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Shula asked Griese to relieve the ailing Morrall, simply asking Griese at halftime, “Are you ready?” Griese replied with, “Yes, I&#x27;m ready.” Griese took the field and completed 3 of 5 passes for 70 yards as the Dolphins beat the Steelers by a score of 21–17 to clinch their second straight Super Bowl appearance.
Despite their unbeaten season, the Dolphins were listed as two point underdogs to the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. Staying with the system that got them there, the Dolphins offense played a perfect ball control game. Griese connected on 8 of 11 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown, and Larry Csonka rushed for over 120 yards. Washington&#x27;s only score was on a returned blocked field goal, and Miami won the game 14–7.

In 1973 Griese led another strong Dolphins team, but they did not make it through the season undefeated. They reached the Super Bowl for the third consecutive season and defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–7.

In 1974, Griese and the Dolphins had an 11–3 regular-season record, but lost to the Oakland Raiders in the divisional round of the playoffs.

In 1975, Griese and the Dolphins started strong, but late in the season in a game against the Baltimore Colts, Griese suffered a broken toe and was out for the rest of the season. The Dolphins finished a respectable 10–4, but missed out on the playoffs for the first time in the Shula era.

In 1976, the Dolphins had many injuries, and the team finished the season at 6–8, the first time Don Shula ever suffered a losing season in his career.

===1977–1980===
The 1977 season was a rebound year for both Griese and the Dolphins; he began to wear eyeglasses on the field. On Thanksgiving, Griese threw six touchdown passes in three quarters to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 55–14, which set a franchise record for most points in a game; the Dolphins scored eight touchdowns and accumulated 34 first downs. He again led the AFC in touchdown passes thrown but the Dolphins rebound to a 10–4 record was again not enough to get the team into the playoffs.

The following year, Griese tore ligaments in his knee in a preseason game. However, when he came back, he was just as strong a passer as he had been the previous year. In one game against the Houston Oilers (nationally telecast as a marquee matchup on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on November 20), Griese dueled with Oiler running back Earl Campbell in an offensive slugfest. Griese threw for over 300 yards while Campbell rushed for nearly 200 and the Oilers won 35–30. For the year, Griese completed a league-leading 63% of his passes, as the Dolphins went 11–5, losing again to the Oilers in the playoffs.
In 1979, he suffered from some nagging leg injuries that affected his throwing ability. He was not as effective, and he began to hear some criticism. However, he was able to lead the Dolphins to a 10–6 record. The Dolphins then found themselves dominated by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round of the playoffs.

In 1980, Griese found himself on the bench due to the emergence of Don Strock and rookie David Woodley. However, Griese came off the bench for several games in a row to lead comeback wins. Griese won back the starting spot in the fifth game of the season, but was tackled hard by Mike Ozdowski of the Baltimore Colts. The tackle tore up his shoulder, and he was out for the rest of the year. The injury eventually led to Griese&#x27;s decision to retire from the game at age 35; he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in .

He had established his reputation as the “Thinking Man&#x27;s Quarterback,” as he brilliantly called his own plays throughout his career. Dolphin owner Joe Robbie called him “the cornerstone of the franchise,” around whom the Miami Dolphins were built. Robbie elected to ask Griese to stay on for another year as assistant coach, which he did for the 1981 season, helping Strock and the young Woodley as they teamed to become the famous “Woodstrock.” After the year ended, he decided that he did not like the hours required to be an assistant coach, hoping to devote more time to his family, yet he still enjoyed being part of the game. (Sources for Pro Football Career found in &quot;Undefeated&quot;, by Bob Griese, 2000, and &quot;The Winning Edge&quot; by Don Shula, 1974.)

The Miami Dolphins had the highest winning percentage in all professional sports in the 1970s, and Bob Griese was its starting quarterback throughout the decade, except when he was injured for several games in 1972, 1975, and 1978.

In Griese&#x27;s 14 pro seasons, he threw for 25,092 yards and 192 touchdowns. Griese also rushed for 994 yards and seven scores. Griese was a six-time Dolphins&#x27; MVP and was All-Pro in 1971 and 1977. He played in two AFL All-Star games and six Pro Bowls.

The Dolphins retired his number 12 during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in 1985, telecast on ABC, the network which would prominently be featured in his post-football career.

===NBC Sports===

To stay in touch with the game, in 1982 Griese decided to take a job as an announcer for NBC Sports, teaming with Charlie Jones for NFL games. While there, he called Super Bowl XX.

===ABC Sports===
In 1987, Griese was hired by ABC Sports, where he began to provide color commentary for college football games.

While at ABC, Griese called the 1999, 2001 and 2005 BCS National Championship games.

At ABC Griese had many opportunities to watch his son Brian Griese play for the Michigan Wolverines. ABC was at first reluctant to let Griese broadcast Michigan games, fearing a conflict of interest. But when they decided to give it a try, Bob remained as impartial and professional as he could be, even referring to his son as “Griese,” rather than Brian, and pointing out errors when he felt necessary.

On January 1, 1998, Bob got to broadcast the Rose Bowl game, the last college game of his son&#x27;s career. Brian was named MVP of the game, leading his Wolverines to an undefeated season and the national championship title with their Rose Bowl victory. Bob and Brian were emotional at that moment, as they thought of Bob&#x27;s wife Judi, who had died from breast cancer in 1988 but whom they both felt was there at that special moment. Bob and Brian later wrote a book, entitled &quot;Undefeated&quot; (), which discussed not only their football connection, but also their love for Judi.

Brian became a professional quarterback and broadcaster himself, playing for the Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and later commentating games for ESPN and ABC.

===ESPN===

During the 2009 and 2010 seasons, Griese served as the lead commentator for ESPN&#x27;s noon college football broadcasts. He retired from ESPN on February 3, 2011.

===Miami Dolphins broadcasts===
Griese has been an analyst for Miami Dolphins preseason TV broadcasts since 2002.

In 2011, he joined the Dolphins radio broadcast team as a color commentator, replacing former teammate Jim Mandich.

==Personal life==
Griese married Purdue classmate Judi Lassus in June 1967, following their graduation, and they had three sons: Brian, Jeff, and Scott. A nurse, Judi lost a six-year battle with breast cancer at age 44 in early 1988. He now resides with his second wife, Shay, in Jupiter, Florida, and Banner Elk, North Carolina. His youngest son is Brian Griese (b. 1975), who also played quarterback in the NFL. His grandson, Jack Griese, son of Scott, is a running back for the University of Virginia.

In 2006, Griese made an appearance on the game show, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;: he won the $100,000 grand prize and donated his $114,310 total winnings to Judi&#x27;s House.

In 1975, Griese received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<doc id="399877" wikidata="Q4821448" url="?curid=399877" title="Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol">
<text>Vice Admiral Augustus John Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol, PC (19 May 1724 – 23 December 1779) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. He commanded the sixth-rate HMS Phoenix at the Battle of Minorca in May 1756 as well as the third-rate HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; at the Capture of Belle Île in June 1761, the Invasion of Martinique in January 1762 and the Battle of Havana in June 1762 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He went on to be Chief Secretary for Ireland and then First Naval Lord.

==Early life==
Hervey was born the second son of John, Lord Hervey and educated at Westminster School from 1733. He entered the Royal Navy in 1735 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1740.

==Naval career==
Promoted to post-captain on 15 January 1747, Hervey was given command of the third-rate HMS &quot;Princess&quot; and later the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot; in January 1752 and saw action in her at the Battle of Minorca in May 1756. He went on to command the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Defiance&quot; later that month, the third-rate HMS &quot;Hampton Court&quot; in May 1757 and the third-rate HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot; in March 1758.

Hervey distinguished himself in several encounters with the French, and was of great assistance to Admiral Hawke in 1759, although he had returned to England before the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759. He took command of the third-rate HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; in March 1760 and saw action during the Capture of Belle Île in June 1761, the Invasion of Martinique in January 1762 and the Battle of Havana in June 1762 before transferring to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; in May 1763.

Having served with distinction in the West Indies under Rodney, his active life at sea ceased when the Peace of Paris was concluded in February 1763. He was, however, nominally Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet in this year. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 31 March 1775 and to vice-admiral on 29 January 1778. He was known as the English Casanova, due to his colourful personal life.

==Political career==
Hervey was Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds from 1757 to 1763, and, after being for a short time Member for Saltash, again represented Bury St Edmunds from 1768 until he succeeded his brother in the earldom of Bristol in 1775; as a member of the House of Lords, he automatically became ineligible to sit in the Commons. He often took part in debates in Parliament, and was a frequent contributor to periodical literature. He was an opponent of the Rockingham ministry and a strong defender of Admiral Keppel with whom he had worked closely. 

He was a Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III from 1763 to 1775 and Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1766 to 1767. He joined the Board of Admiralty as First Naval Lord in the North ministry in February 1771 and stood down from the Admiralty Board in April 1775.

==Personal life==
In August 1744 Hervey had been secretly married to Elizabeth Chudleigh (1720–1788), afterwards Duchess of Kingston, but this union was dissolved in 1769. Lord Bristol died leaving no legitimate issue, and having, as far as possible, alienated his property from the title.

In 1748 after Hervey had rejoined his ship and his marriage was foundering, he had formed a deep passion for Etheldreda Townshend, who had previously attracted the amorous attentions of both his elder brother George and his father.

In about 1765 Hervey paid to take Ann Elliot off the stage to become his mistress. She would go on to take the King&#x27;s brother as her lover. From 1775 Hervey had taken as his mistress Mary Nesbitt, a former artists&#x27; model of some notoriety. They lived together, apparently faithfully, at his Surrey home of Norwood House and she received property in his will. He made changes to Norwood House including an ornamental lake and a stable. He died due to gout in the stomach at St James&#x27;s Square, London on 23 December 1779, aged 55, and was buried at Ickworth in Suffolk; he was succeeded by his brother Frederick.
Many of his letters are in the Record Office, and his journals are in the British Museum. Other letters are printed in the &quot;Grenville Papers&quot;, vols. iii. and iv. (London, 1852–1853), and the &quot;Life of Admiral Keppel&quot;, by the Rev. Thomas Keppel (London, 1852). Hervey Bay, Queensland, a bay and city in the Fraser Coast region of Australia, was named after him by Captain James Cook while carrying out the survey of the east coast of Australia on 22 May 1770. Bristol Bay, the rich salmon fishing ground in southwest Alaska, was so named in honour of Hervey by Captain James Cook, who first charted the region in July 1778. Bristol Island, a five-mile long ice-covered quake-prone chain of volcanos in the South Sandwich Islands and the coral atoll comprising the islands of Manuae and Te-O-Au-Tu in the Cook Islands were also named in honour of Hervey by Captain James Cook.

<doc id="399881" wikidata="Q3051201" url="?curid=399881" title="Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon-Hull">
<text>Elizabeth Pierrepont (née Chudleigh), Duchess of Kingston (8 March 172126 August 1788), sometimes called Countess of Bristol, was an English courtier and courtesan, known by her contemporaries for her adventurous life style. She was the daughter of Colonel Thomas Chudleigh (died 1726), and was appointed maid of honour to Augusta, Princess of Wales, in 1743, probably through the good offices of her friend William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath.

Having married again while her first husband was still living, in 1776 Chudleigh was found guilty of bigamy at a trial by her peers at Westminster Hall that attracted 4,000 spectators.

==Marriage to Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol==
Elizabeth Chudleigh was born on 8 March 1721. Her father, Colonel Thomas Chudleigh, was lieutenant governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea; he died while she was a small child.

Chudleigh did not lack admirers, among them James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton, and Augustus Hervey, later 3rd Earl of Bristol, but, at that time, a younger grandson of the first Earl. On 4 August 1744, she was privately married to Hervey at Lainston House, a private country house with its parish church (St Peter&#x27;s, now a ruin), near Winchester. The wedding was held at night to preserve the secrecy. Both husband and wife lacked the financial support they needed, and their union was kept secret to enable Chudleigh to retain her post at court, while Hervey, a naval officer, rejoined his ship, returning to England toward the close of 1746.

The marriage was unhappy, and for years, the pair did not live together. Married in secret, their marriage did not seem to need to be dissolved. However, when it appeared in 1759 that Hervey could succeed his brother as Earl of Bristol, Chudleigh established proof of their marriage by forging an entry in the parish register at Lainston, unbeknownst to him.

==Marriage to Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull==

Chudleigh &quot;cut a prominent figure&quot; in British society, and in 1765 in Berlin, she had the honor to meet Frederick the Great. Then, she became the mistress of Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull.

Hervey wanted to end their marriage by divorce, but Chudleigh preferred to avoid any public acknowledgment of it. She initiated a suit of jactitation against him though with his collusion, requiring him to cease claiming marriage to her unless proved. After Hervey failed to prove the relationship in court and Chudleigh swore she was unmarried, the consistory court in February 1769 pronounced her a spinster, free to marry.

Within a month, she married Kingston and became Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon-Hull. On Knightsbridge, in the City of Westminster, the Duke built for her a grand town house called Chudleigh House, later renamed as Kingston House.

Kingston died in 1773, leaving Chudleigh all his property, on condition she remain a widow.

==Charges of bigamy==

In 1775, her first husband&#x27;s brother died, and Hervey became Earl of Bristol. If Chudleigh&#x27;s marriage to Hervey had been lawful, despite her denials, she had therefore become Countess of Bristol.

Chudleigh was forced to return to England after Evelyn Meadows (died 1826), a nephew of her second husband, brought a charge of bigamy against her, in the hope of establishing a challenge to the Duke of Kingston&#x27;s will. In December 1775 she attempted unsuccessfully to have the charge set aside, by reason of the previous judgment in her favour. However, in 1776 she was tried as a peeress in Westminster Hall and was found guilty by 116 peers, without dissent. Absconding with her Kingston fortune, she hurriedly left England to avoid further proceedings on the part of the Meadows family.

In 1777, Hervey gained legal recognition that his marriage to Chudleigh had been lawful, but he did not pursue divorce proceedings, probably because of his involvement with the suit of jactitation.

==Later life and legacy ==

After Kingston&#x27;s death, she travelled abroad. Visiting Rome, she was received with the honour due to a duchess by Pope Clement XIV.

Chudleigh lived for a time in Calais, and became mistress to Stefano Zannowich. In 1777, after her acceptance at the Russian court, the two had a boat built and made a spectacular entrance sailing into Kronstadt, the port of Saint Petersburg. In the Governorate of Estonia, she bought three properties: Toila, Oru and Voka (Fockenhoff) (near the town of Jõhvi in Ida-Viru County, northeastern Estonia), consolidating them into an estate she named &quot;Chudleigh&quot;. She planned to create a model English estate and imported spaniels, pointers, and a collection of plants, living there in a clifftop house looking over the Baltic Sea.

Chudleigh continued to style herself as Duchess of Kingston, residing in her Paris estate in Montmartre, Rome, and elsewhere, and died at her estate at Saint-Assise near Paris on 26 August 1788 aged 67, in the eyes of the law as Dowager Countess of Bristol, as Hervey had died in 1779.

==In popular culture==
Chudleigh appears as a character in T. H. White&#x27;s non-fiction &quot;The Age of Scandal&quot; and in Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s historical romance &quot;I, Libertine&quot;, which began as a hoax. She appears as a non-speaking character in the play &quot;Mr Foote&#x27;s Other Leg&quot;, in which the controversy surrounding her and Foote is portrayed as central to the latter&#x27;s fall.

The Duchess or Countess, said to be coarse and licentious, was ridiculed as the character Kitty Crocodile by the comedian Samuel Foote in a play &quot;A Trip to Calais&quot;, which, however, he was not allowed to produce. Chudleigh is also rumored to have inspired William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s character of Beatrix Esmond, Baroness Bernstein, in &quot;The History of Henry Esmond&quot; and &quot;The Virginians&quot;.

<text>Lenore Kandel (January 14, 1932, New York City – October 18, 2009, San Francisco, California) was an American poet, affiliated with the Beat Generation and Hippie counterculture.

== Biography ==

Although Kandel was born in New York, her family lived in Bucks County, Pennsylvania during her childhood. Afterward, she moved to Los Angeles to live with her father, screenwriter Aben Kandel. Her brother, prolific screenwriter Stephen Kandel, was best known for co-creating Harry Mudd, a prominent recurring &quot;Star Trek&quot; character.

She returned to New York to attend The New School for Social Research on scholarship for three and a half years before she dropped out. She moved to San Francisco in 1960. She began living in the East-West House co-op, where she met Jack Kerouac, who later immortalized her as &quot;Romana Swartz&quot;, &quot;a big Rumanian monster beauty&quot;, in his novel &quot;Big Sur&quot; (1962). In the novel, she is described as being the girlfriend of Dave Wain, who was based on Lew Welch. &quot;Dave&quot; describes how she walked around the &quot;Zen-East House&quot; (&quot;East-West House&quot;) wearing only purple panties. Kerouac described her as &quot;intelligent, well read, writes poetry, is a Zen student, knows everything [...]&quot; (&quot;Big Sur&quot;, p. 75).

Her first works of poetry were the chapbooks &quot;An Exquisite Navel&quot;, &quot;A Passing Dragon&quot;, and &quot;A Passing Dragon Seen Again&quot;, published in 1959. Several of her poems also appeared in &quot;Beat and Beatific II&quot; in 1959.

Kandel was briefly notorious as the author of a short book of poetry, &quot;The Love Book&quot;. A small pamphlet consisting of four poems, &quot;The Love Book&quot; provoked censorship with its three-part poem, &quot;To Fuck with Love.&quot; Police seized the work as being in violation of state obscenity codes, from both City Lights Books and &quot;The Psychedelic Shop&quot; in 1966. Subsequently, Kandel gained cause célèbre status. She herself defended her verse as &quot;holy erotica.&quot; A jury declared the book obscene and lacking in any redeeming social value in 1967 and sales increased; Kandel thanked the police by giving one percent of all profits to the Police Retirement Association. The decision was overturned on appeal and the book continued to sell well.

In 1964, she participated in The Berkeley Poetry Conference organized by Richard Baker, Program Coordinator, University of California Berkeley, Liberal Arts Extension, along with poets Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg, Bob Creeley, and many others. Kandel was a speaker at the Human Be-In in the Golden Gate Park polo fields on January 14, 1967. The only woman to speak from the stage, Kandel defiantly read from &quot;The Love Book&quot;. It was her 35th birthday, and McClure later stated, &quot;The entire crowd of 20,000 or 30,000 people sang &#x27;Happy Birthday&#x27; to her.&quot;

Kandel published her only full-length book of poems, &quot;Word Alchemy&quot;, in 1967. She was one of 15 people interviewed in &quot;Voices from the Love Generation&quot; (Little, Brown and Company, 1968). In 1976, Kandel recited a poem at the iconic concert The Last Waltz performed by The Band (but was not included in the film or soundtrack).

In 1970, Kandel suffered massive spinal injuries in a motorcycle crash with her then-husband Billy &quot;Sweet Wiliam&quot; Fritsch (poet, stevedore, and member of the Diggers (theater) and Hells Angels). Despite having to cope with excruciating pain for the remainder of her life, she continued to write and maintain social ties.

She died at home on October 18, 2009, of complications from lung cancer, with which she had been diagnosed several weeks earlier.

In 2012, &quot;Collected Poems of Lenore Kandel&quot; was published. It features 80 of her poems, many of which had never before been published.

== Film and music ==

Kandel appears in the Digger film &quot;Nowsreal&quot; (1968), sewing a Hells Angel patch on William Fritsch&#x27;s jacket.

Kandel appears in the Kenneth Anger film &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot; (1969), with William Fritsch, smoking a marijuana cigarette contained in a miniature skull.

In the 2013 film &quot;Big Sur&quot;, Kandel is portrayed by Stana Katic.

<text>John Heneage Jesse (1809 – 7 July 1874), English historian, son of Edward Jesse, was educated at Eton and became a clerk in the secretary&#x27;s department of the Admiralty.

His poem on Mary, Queen of Scots was published about 1831, and was followed by a collection of poems entitled &quot;Tales of the Dead&quot;. He also wrote a drama, &quot;Richard III&quot;, and a fragmentary poem entitled &quot;London&quot;. None of these ventures achieved any success, but his numerous historical works are written with vivacity and interest, and, in their own style, are an important contribution to the history of England.

They include:
*&quot;Memoirs of the Court of England during the Reign of the Stuarts&quot; (1840)
*&quot;Memoirs of the Court of England from the Revolution of 1688 to the Death of George II&quot; (1843)
*&quot;George Selwyn and his Contemporaries&quot; (1843, new ed. 1882)
*&quot;Memoirs of the Pretenders and their Adherents&quot; (1845)
*&quot;Memoirs of Richard the Third and his Contemporaries&quot; (1861)
*&quot;Memoirs of the Life and Reign of King George the Third&quot; (1867)
The titles of these works are sufficiently indicative of their character. They are sketches of the principal personages and of the social details of various periods in the history of England rather than complete and comprehensive historical narratives.

In addition to these works Jesse wrote &quot;Literary and Historical Memorials of London&quot; (1847), &quot;London and its Celebrities&quot; (1850), and a new edition of this work as &quot;London: its Celebrated Characters and Remarkable Places&quot; (1871). His &quot;Memoirs of Celebrated Etonians&quot; appeared in 1875.

A collected edition containing most of his works in thirty volumes was published in London in 1901.
In Richmond Park&#x27;s Pembroke Lodge gardens, there is a memorial to the poet James Thomson, who died at Richmond in 1748. This is a black wooden board with a poem about Thomson by John Heneage Jesse.

<text>Howard Rheingold (born 1947) is an American critic, writer, and teacher, known for his specialties on the cultural, social and political implications of modern communication media such as the Internet, mobile telephony and virtual communities.

==Biography==
Rheingold was born on July 7, 1947, in Phoenix, Arizona. He graduated from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in 1968. His senior thesis was entitled &quot;What Life Can Compare with This? Sitting Alone at the Window, I Watch the Flowers Bloom, the Leaves Fall, the Seasons Come and Go&quot;.

A lifelong fascination with mind augmentation and its methods led Rheingold to the Institute of Noetic Sciences and Xerox PARC. There he worked on and wrote about the earliest personal computers. This led to his writing &quot;Tools for Thought&quot; in 1985, a history of the people behind the personal computer. Around that time he first logged on to The WELL – an influential early online community. He explored the experience in his seminal book, &quot;The Virtual Community&quot;.

Also in 1985, Rheingold coauthored &quot;Out of the Inner Circle: A Hacker&#x27;s Guide to Computer Security&quot; with former hacker Bill Landreth. In 1991, he published &quot;Virtual Reality: Exploring the Brave New Technologies of Artificial Experience and Interactive Worlds from Cyberspace to Teledildonics&quot;.

After a stint editing the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;, Rheingold served as editor in chief of the &quot;Millennium Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he was hired on as founding executive editor of &quot;HotWired&quot;, one of the first commercial content web sites published in 1994 by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. Rheingold left &quot;HotWired&quot; and soon founded Electric Minds in 1996 to chronicle and promote the growth of community online. Despite accolades, the site was sold and scaled back in 1997.

In 1998, he created his next virtual community, Brainstorms, which, as of 2024, is a successful private webconferencing community for knowledgeable, intellectual, civil, and future-thinking adults from all over the world. 

In 2002, Rheingold published &quot;Smart Mobs&quot;, exploring the potential for technology to augment collective intelligence. Shortly thereafter, in conjunction with the Institute for the Future, Rheingold launched an effort to develop a broad-based literacy of cooperation.

In 2008, Rheingold became the first research fellow at the Institute for the Future, with which he had long been affiliated.

Rheingold is a visiting lecturer in Stanford University&#x27;s Department of Communication where he has taught courses such as &quot;Digital Journalism&quot;, &quot;Virtual Communities and Social Media&quot;, and &quot;Social Media Literacies&quot;. He is a former lecturer in UC Berkeley&#x27;s School of Information where he taught &quot;Virtual Communities and Social Media&quot; and &quot;Participatory Media/Collective Action&quot;. He has been a frequent contributor to the Connected Learning Alliance blog on topics ranging from new media literacy to learning innovation.

Rheingold lives in Mill Valley, California, with his wife Judy and daughter Mamie. In an entry on his video blog, he provides a tour of the converted garage that became a &quot;dream office&quot; and an &quot;externalization of [his] mind&quot; where Rheingold absorbs information, writes, and creates art.

He contributed the essay &quot;Participative Pedagogy for a Literacy of Literacies&quot; to the Freesouls book project.

<doc id="399887" wikidata="Q1074835" url="?curid=399887" title="SyncML">
<text>SyncML, or Synchronization Markup Language, was originally developed as a platform-independent standard for information synchronization. Established by the SyncML Initiative, this project has evolved to become a key component in data synchronization and device management. The project is currently referred to as &quot;Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronization and Device Management&quot;. The purpose of SyncML is to offer an open standard as a replacement for existing data synchronization solutions; which have mostly been somewhat vendor, application, or operating system specific. SyncML 1.0 specification was released on December 17, 2000, and 1.1 on February 26, 2002.

A SyncML message is a well-formed XML document that adheres to the document type definition (DTD), but which does not require validation.

==Internals==

SyncML works by exchanging commands, which can be requests and responses. As an example:

* the mobile phone sends an codice_1 command for signaling the wish to begin a refresh-only synchronization
* the computer responds with a codice_2 command for accepting the request
* the phone sends one or more codice_3 command containing an Add sub-command for each item (e.g., phonebook entry); if the number of entries is large, it does not include the &lt;Final/&gt; tag;
* in the latter case, the computer requests to continue with an appropriate codice_1 message, and the mobile sends another chunk of items; otherwise, the computer confirms it received all data with a codice_2 command

Commands (codice_1, codice_3, codice_2, etc.) are grouped into messages. Each message and each of its commands has an identifier, so that the pair (MsgID, CmdID) uniquely determines a command. Responses like codice_2 commands include the pair identifying the command they are responding to.

Before commands, messages contain a header specifying various data regarding the transaction. An example message containing the codice_1 command for begin a refresh synchronization, like in the previous example, is:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE SyncML PUBLIC &quot;-//SYNCML//DTD SyncML 1.2//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/OMA-TS-SyncML_RepPro_DTD-V1_2.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;SyncML xmlns=&quot;SYNCML:SYNCML1.2&quot;&gt;
 &lt;SyncHdr&gt;
 &lt;VerDTD&gt;1.1&lt;/VerDTD&gt;
 &lt;VerProto&gt;SyncML/1.1&lt;/VerProto&gt;
 &lt;SessionID&gt;1&lt;/SessionID&gt;
 &lt;MsgID&gt;1&lt;/MsgID&gt;
 &lt;Target&gt;&lt;LocURI&gt;PC Suite&lt;/LocURI&gt;&lt;/Target&gt;
 &lt;Source&gt;&lt;LocURI&gt;IMEI:3405623856456&lt;/LocURI&gt;&lt;/Source&gt;
 &lt;Meta&gt;&lt;MaxMsgSize xmlns=&quot;syncml:metinf&quot;&gt;8000&lt;/MaxMsgSize&gt;&lt;/Meta&gt;
 &lt;/SyncHdr&gt;

 &lt;SyncBody&gt;
 &lt;Alert&gt;
 &lt;CmdID&gt;1&lt;/CmdID&gt;
 &lt;Data&gt;203&lt;/Data&gt; &lt;!-- 203 = mobile signals a refresh from it to computer --&gt;
 &lt;Item&gt;
 &lt;Target&gt;&lt;LocURI&gt;Events&lt;/LocURI&gt;&lt;/Target&gt;
 &lt;Source&gt;&lt;LocURI&gt;/telecom/cal.vcs&lt;/LocURI&gt;&lt;/Source&gt;
 &lt;Meta&gt;&lt;Anchor xmlns=&quot;syncml:metinf&quot;&gt;&lt;Last&gt;42&lt;/Last&gt;&lt;Next&gt;42&lt;/Next&gt;&lt;/Anchor&gt;&lt;/Meta&gt;
 &lt;/Item&gt;
 &lt;/Alert&gt;

 &lt;Final/&gt;
 &lt;/SyncBody&gt;
&lt;/SyncML&gt;
The response from the computer could be an XML document like (comments added
for the sake of explanation):
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE SyncML PUBLIC &quot;-//SYNCML//DTD SyncML 1.2//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/OMA-TS-SyncML_RepPro_DTD-V1_2.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;SyncML&gt;
 &lt;SyncHdr&gt;
 &lt;VerDTD&gt;1.1&lt;/VerDTD&gt;
 &lt;VerProto&gt;SyncML/1.1&lt;/VerProto&gt;
 &lt;SessionID&gt;1&lt;/SessionID&gt;
 &lt;MsgID&gt;1&lt;/MsgID&gt;
 &lt;Target&gt;&lt;LocURI&gt;IMEI:3405623856456&lt;/LocURI&gt;&lt;/Target&gt;
 &lt;Source&gt;&lt;LocURI&gt;PC Suite&lt;/LocURI&gt;&lt;/Source&gt;
 &lt;/SyncHdr&gt;

 &lt;SyncBody&gt;

 &lt;!-- accept the header of the last message from the client --&gt;
 &lt;Status&gt;
 &lt;CmdID&gt;1&lt;/CmdID&gt;
 &lt;MsgRef&gt;1&lt;/MsgRef&gt;
 &lt;CmdRef&gt;0&lt;/CmdRef&gt; &lt;!-- 0 = header of the message --&gt;
 &lt;Cmd&gt;SyncHdr&lt;/Cmd&gt;
 &lt;TargetRef&gt;PC Suite&lt;/TargetRef&gt;
 &lt;SourceRef&gt;IMEI:3405623856456&lt;/SourceRef&gt;
 &lt;Data&gt;200&lt;/Data&gt; &lt;!-- 200 = ok, accepted --&gt;
 &lt;/Status&gt;

 &lt;!-- accept the request of the mobile for a sync --&gt;
 &lt;Status&gt;
 &lt;CmdID&gt;2&lt;/CmdID&gt; &lt;!-- this is command #2 --&gt;
 &lt;MsgRef&gt;1&lt;/MsgRef&gt;
 &lt;CmdRef&gt;1&lt;/CmdRef&gt; &lt;!-- it respond to command msg=1,cmd=1 --&gt;
 &lt;Cmd&gt;Alert&lt;/Cmd&gt;
 &lt;TargetRef&gt;Events&lt;/TargetRef&gt;
 &lt;SourceRef&gt;/telecom/cal.vcs&lt;/SourceRef&gt;
 &lt;Meta&gt;&lt;Anchor xmlns=&quot;syncml:metinf&quot;&gt;&lt;Next&gt;0&lt;/Next&gt;&lt;Last&gt;0&lt;/Last&gt;&lt;/Anchor&gt;&lt;/Meta&gt;
 &lt;Data&gt;200&lt;/Data&gt; &lt;!-- 200 = ok, accepted --&gt;
 &lt;/Status&gt;

 &lt;Final/&gt;
 &lt;/SyncBody&gt;
&lt;/SyncML&gt;
The transaction then proceeds with a message from the mobile containing the codice_3 command, and so on.

This example is a refresh where the mobile sends all its data to the computer and nothing in the other way around. Different codes in the initial codice_1 command can be used to initiate other kinds of synchronizations. For example, in a &quot;two-way sync&quot;, only the changes from the last synchronization are sent to the computer, which does the same.

The codice_13 and codice_14 tags are used to keep track of a possible loss of sync. codice_13 represents the time of the last operation of synchronization, as measured by each device. For example, a mobile may use progressive numbers (codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, ...) to represent time, while the computer uses strings like &quot;codice_19&quot;. codice_14 is the current time in the same representation. This latter data is stored and then compared with codice_13 in the next synchronization. Any difference indicates a loss of sync. Appropriate actions involving sending all data can be then taken to put the devices back in sync.

Anchors are only used to detect a loss of sync; they do not indicate which data is to be sent. Apart from the loss-of-synchronization situation, in a normal (non-refresh) synchronization, each device sends a log of changes since the last synchronization.

<text>Edward Jesse (14 January 1780 – 28 March 1868) was an English writer on natural history. As a surveyor for the Office of Works, he was responsible for much of the restoration and presentation of Hampton Court Palace after it was opened to the public in 1838.

== Life ==
Jesse was born at Hutton Cranswick, Yorkshire, the third son and youngest of four children of Reverend William Jesse (1738-1814) and Mary Jesse. Originally the parish vicar for Hutton Cranswick, Rev. Jesse later became a prominent evangelical vicar in West Bromwich and personal chaplain to the 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, a convert of Selina Hastings.

Jesse was privately educated, and in 1798 was appointed to a clerkship in the Santo Domingo office. Jesse&#x27;s command of French recommended him to the 3rd Earl of Dartmouth, who made Jesse his private secretary on his appointment in 1801 as President of the Board of Control (overseeing the British East India Company). Following his promotion to Lord Steward in 1802, Dartmouth commended Jesse to the Royal Household, and Jesse was appointed to the ceremonial post of Gentleman of the Ewry in 1803 (which he held until its abolition in 1832). Jesse was also commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Birmingham Volunteers, and on the corps disbandment the Duke of Rutland appointed Jesse as captain in the Leicestershire Militia in 1805. In 1814 Jesse was made a Commissioner of Hackney Coaches (or &#x27;Jarvies&#x27;), which he held until responsibility for coach licensing was transferred to the Stamp Office in 1831.

Jesse was made a clerk in the Office of Woods and Forests by Lord Glenbervie c1821, and following the abolition of the posts of Gentleman of the Ewry and Hackney Coach Commissioner, was appointed Itinerant Deputy Surveyor in the Office of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, with responsibility for Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle, in 1834. On the abolition of this office he retired on a pension, and he died in 1868 at Brighton.

Jesse married his first wife, Matilda Morris, daughter of Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet in 1807. Their son, John, born 1809, became a noted court historian. Their eldest daughter Frances, born 1810, married Edward Curwen, a lieutenant in the 14th Dragoons, in 1833. Their youngest daughter Matilda, born 1811, became a noted author and women&#x27;s rights activist. Following Matilda&#x27;s death c1851, Jesse married Jane Caroline in 1852, who survived him. 

== Works ==

=== Natural history ===
The result of his interest in the habits and characteristics of animals was a series of pleasant and popular books on natural history. He also edited Izaak Walton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Angler.&quot; (See Bibliography)&quot;.&quot;

=== Guide books ===
Jesse contributed to the second edition of Leitch Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Windsor Castle&quot;, and edited later editions of Gilbert White&#x27;s &quot;Selborne.&quot; He wrote a number of handbooks to places of interest, including Windsor and Hampton Court (see Bibliography).

=== Hampton Court Palace ===
In 1832 the Office of Works and Public Buildings was subsumed into the Office of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, and responsibility for the maintenance of unoccupied Royal palaces was passed to the reconstituted Office of Works in 1838. As Itinerant Deputy Surveyor with responsibility for the districts of Hampton Court and Windsor, Hampton Court Palace fell under Jesse&#x27;s responsibility.

The Palace was opened to the general public in December 1838, initially displaying works from the Royal Collection in the State Apartments, with only the interior courtyards, gardens and Apartments open for viewing. Previously, members of the public had been able to tour the palace in small groups conducted by the housekeeper, but the Great Hall had been inaccessible throughout. The Hall had been cleared in the early 18th century by architect James Wyatt (on the orders of George III), removing the theatre fixtures and fittings installed by William III and George I, and adding a new door at the east end of the Hall through to the Great Watching Chamber. 

In July 1840 Jesse began a substantial restoration of the Great Hall for public display, his Romantic interpretation aiming to give &quot;an appearance similar, perhaps, to that it formerly presented when it was occupied by the Cardinal of York and his princely retinue.&quot; Jesse&#x27;s restoration was influenced by the Gothic Revival of the mid-nineteenth century, and in particular the work of architects Jeffry Wyatville (who had remodelled Windsor Castle), and Edward Blore, who had assisted Jesse with the Tudor restoration of the West Front of Hampton Court Palace. Jesse was also influenced by the historical novels of Walter Scott, whose tales of romantic chivalry in medieval settings were popular with the Victorian reading public; Jesse referenced Scott in several of his works.

Jesse decorated the Great Hall with stag&#x27;s heads between each window, banners displaying the &quot;devices of Henry VIII and the arms of Wolsey&quot;, and a string course of Tudor roses and portcullises. Jesse commissioned a statue of St George slaying the Dragon, which was placed on &quot;a richly-carved stone bracket, inscribed &quot;&#x27;Seynt George for merrie Englande&quot;,&#x27;&quot;. Tapestries depicting &quot;The Story of Abraham&quot; were moved from the State Apartments, where they had formed the backdrop to the growing population of paintings from the Royal Collection, to hang in the Great Hall, Jesse noting each to be &quot;of such excellent design, and of such costliness of material, that it may be safely asserted that its parallel does not exist in Europe at this time.&quot; Collections of arms and armour were placed at either end of the Hall, specially-commissioned or loaned from the Tower of London collection. 

Informed by research of the original building accounts, Jesse undertook a second phase of restorative works in 1844, which included the painting of the hammerbeam roof members in bright shades of white, vermillion, blue and green, and gilding the heraldic badges in gold.

==== Thomas Willement stained glass commission ====
Jesse also commissioned stained glass artist Thomas Willement to chart the Tudor history of the Palace in a series of windows on all sides of the Hall and the Great Watching Chamber. The west window, relating to Henry&#x27;s wives and family, provides a full-length portrait of Henry VIII beneath a canopy of state and his arms, cyphers and badges. Alongside Henry are the arms, devices and mottoes of each his wives, and beneath him those of his children Edward VI, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. The two small gable windows above show the arms of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (the original owners of the Manor of Hampton), Lord Thomas Docwra (who leased the Manor to Thomas Wolsey), the Archbishopric of York and Cardinal Wolsey. The east window is dedicated to Henry&#x27;s lineage, showing Henry surrounded by the arms and badges of John Duke of Somerset, Margaret of Richmond, Henry VII, Elizabeth of York, Edward IV, Richard Duke of York, John Earl of Somerset, John Duke of Lancester, Edmond Duke of York and Richard of Cambridge. 


Williment also set out the line of descent of each of Henry VIII&#x27;s wives in alternate windows on the north and south sides of the Hall. 

==== Criticism and legacy ====
Jesse&#x27;s restoration of the Great Hall was the subject of both contemporary criticism (on the grounds of aesthetics and historical authenticity) and praise (for the vivid presentation of context, colour and armour). Henry Cole wrote &quot;[the] effect would have been far more satisfactory if the judgment of the decorator had been as good as his intention,&quot; yet despite the incongruous juxtaposition of disparate Tudor actors and symbolism in Willement&#x27;s windows, &quot;the restoration of the coloured glass ... is most welcome, and characteristic of old times.&quot; Jesse&#x27;s arrangement of the Great Hall continued to be presented until 1925, and Willement&#x27;s stained glass remains in place today. 

Jesse&#x27;s presentation of the Great Hall has since been described as &quot;one of the great Romantic interiors of the mid-nineteenth century&quot;. Jesse himself has been described as &quot;both the first curator and the first interpreter of Hampton Court Palace,&quot; and &quot;a forerunner to the HRP Conservation and Learning Department&quot;.

<doc id="399893" wikidata="Q766758" url="?curid=399893" title="Samuel Foote">
<text>Samuel Foote (January 1720 – 21 October 1777) was a Cornish dramatist, actor and theatre manager. He was known for his comedic acting and writing, and for turning the loss of a leg in a riding accident in 1766 to comedic opportunity.

==Early life==
Born into a well-to-do family, Foote was baptized in Truro, Cornwall on 27 January 1720. His father, Samuel Foote, held several public positions, including mayor of Truro, Member of Parliament representing Tiverton and a commissioner in the Prize Office. His mother, née Eleanor Goodere, was the daughter of Sir Edward Goodere Baronet of Hereford. Foote may have inherited his wit and sharp humour from her and her family which was described as &quot;eccentric. ..whose peculiarities ranged from the harmless to the malevolent.&quot; About the time Foote came of age, he inherited his first fortune when one of his uncles, Sir John Dineley Goodere, 2nd Baronet was murdered by another uncle, Captain Samuel Goodere. This murder was the subject of his first pamphlet, which he published around 1741.

Foote was educated at Truro Grammar School, the collegiate school at Worcester, and at Worcester College, Oxford, distinguishing himself in these places by mimicry and audacious pleasantries of all kinds. An undisciplined student, he frequently was absent from his Latin and Greek classes and subsequently, Oxford expelled him on 28 January 1740. Although he left Oxford without receiving his degree, he acquired a classical training which afterwards enabled him to easily turn a classical quotation or allusion, and helped to give to his prose style a certain fluency and elegance.

Foote was destined for the law, but certainly not by nature. In his chambers at the Inner Temple, and in the Grecian Coffee House nearby, he came to know something of lawyers if not of law, and was afterwards able to jest at the jargon and to mimic the mannerisms of the bar, and to satirize the Latitats of the other branch of the profession with particular success. Though he never applied himself to his studies at the Inner Temple, he well applied himself to spending money and living as a &quot;,&quot; which led to him quickly running out of funds.

After finding himself in debt, Foote married a certain Mary Hickes (or Hicks) on 10 January 1741. With his wife also came a sizable dowry. Contemporaries note that Foote mistreated his wife, deserting her when his financial situation improved and Hickes may have died an early death. But a stronger attraction drew him to the Bedford Coffee-house in Covent Garden, and to the theatrical world of which it was the social centre. His extravagant living soon forced him into debtor&#x27;s prison in 1742, and friends encouraged Foote&#x27;s going onto the stage to make a living.

==Initial theatrical ventures==

Foote&#x27;s first training for the stage came under the tutelage of Charles Macklin. By 1744, when they appeared onstage together, Macklin had made a name for himself as one of the most notable actors on the British stage, after David Garrick. His appearance as Shylock in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1741, mesmerized London audiences. Dismissing the conventional comedic approach to the character, Macklin played the character as consummately evil. Following his debut, George II reportedly could not sleep, while Georg Lichtenberg described Macklin&#x27;s interpretation of Shylock&#x27;s first line—&quot;Three thousand ducats&quot;—as being uttered &quot;as lickerously as if he were savouring the ducats and all they would buy.&quot; Following less than a year of training, Foote appeared opposite Macklin&#x27;s Iago as the titular role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre, 6 February 1744. While his first appearance was unsuccessful, it is noted that this production was produced illegally under the Licensing Act 1737 which forbade the production of plays by theatres not holding letters patent or the production of plays not approved by the Lord Chamberlain. In order to skirt this law, the Haymarket Theatre held musical concerts with plays included &quot;gratis&quot;.

Following his unsuccessful London appearance, Foote spent the summer season in Dublin at the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley where he found his first success. Returning to England, he joined the company at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane which at that time included such noted actors as Peg Woffington, David Garrick and Spranger Barry. There he played comic roles including Harry Wildair in Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Couple,&quot; Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;The Relapse&quot; and most notably, the playwright, Bayes in Villiers&#x27; &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;. It was in this role that Foote publicly showed his gift of mimicry. Borrowing from David Garrick&#x27;s interpretation of the role, Foote used this role to mock many leading contemporaries.

==The Haymarket Theatre==
Even with his success onstage, Foote remained impoverished. Attempting life as a theatre manager, he secured a lease on the Haymarket Theatre in 1746. Foote began writing in earnest, producing two pamphlets, &quot;A Treatise on the Passions&quot; and &quot;The Roman and English Comedy Considered&quot;. After illegally producing &quot;Othello&quot;, Foote opened one of his own plays, &quot;The Diversions of the Morning or, A Dish of Chocolate&quot;, a satire on contemporary actors and public figures performed by himself, on 22 April 1747. The &quot;Dish of Chocolate&quot; of the title referred to a dish or tea offered by Foote to accompany the musical entertainment while the performance was offered gratis, all done to avoid the Licensing Act. On the morning following the performance, the theatre was locked and audiences gathering for the noon performance (another gimmick to evade the law was to stage the show as a ) were turned away by authorities. Foote&#x27;s jabs at other actors brought the ire of many at Drury Lane and the managers took steps to protect their patent.

Fortunately for Foote, some highly placed friends at court helped the theatre reopen and the play continued. In June, Foote offered &quot;A Cup of Tea&quot;, a revision of his revue, &quot;Diversions&quot;, again in the guise of a culinary offering. After a brief trip to Paris, Foote opened &quot;The Auction of Pictures&quot; which satirized satirist Henry Fielding. A war of wit was launched with each lambasting the other in ink and onstage. Among the verbal missiles hurled, Fielding denounced Foote in &quot;The Jacobite&#x27;s Journal&quot; saying &quot;you &quot;Samuel Fut&quot; [sic] be pissed upon, with Scorn and Contempt, as a low Buffoon; and I do, with the utmost Scorn and Contempt, piss on you accordingly.&quot;

==&quot;The Author&quot; himself==
The Fielding quarrel was followed by a more serious quarrel with actor Henry Woodward. This resulted in a small riot that was damaging not only to the Haymarket Theatre but to Foote&#x27;s reputation. He began to deflect criticism only with the opening of his play, &quot;The Knights&quot;. This play, unlike his earlier satirical revues, was a romantic comedy set in the country, though he did use this play as a vehicle to satirize such things as Italian opera and the gentry of Cornwall.
At the close of the Haymarket season in 1749, Foote left London for Paris in order to spend money he had recently inherited. Upon his return to London in 1752, Foote&#x27;s new comedy, &quot;Taste&quot;, was produced at Drury Lane. Foote took aim at the burgeoning art and antiquities market and particularly aristocratic collectors. In his preface to the play, Foote specifies his targets as the &quot;barbarians who have prostituted the study of antiquity to trifling superficiality, who have blasted the progress of the elegant arts by unpardonable frauds and absurd prejudices, and who have vitiated the minds and morals of youth by persuading them that what serves only to illustrate literature is true knowledge and that active idelness is real business.&quot;

&quot;Taste&quot; opens with Lady Pentweazel who believes that the works of art, the Venus de&#x27; Medici and the Mary de Medici, are sisters in the Medici family. Two other collectors, Novice and Lord Dupe, claim to be able to determine the age and value of coins and medals by tasting them while Puff, an auctioneer, convinces them and Sir Positive Bubble that broken china and statuary are worth far more than perfect pieces. Lord Dupe follows this advice by purchasing a canvas with the paint scraped off. The foibles of ignorant art collectors and predatory dealers were presented by Foote in this high burlesque comedy. In order for an audience to appreciate high burlesque, they must understand the standards of true taste before they can recognize the conflict between those standards and the characters&#x27; standards. The audience that saw the premier of &quot;Taste&quot; evidently did not understand this conflict as the play was not successful and played only five performances.

Following the unsuccessful reception of &quot;Taste&quot;, Foote staged a new production, &quot;An Englishman in Paris&quot;, inspired by both his trip there and possibly, as Davison suggests, a French play, &quot;Frenchman in London&quot; which he may have seen. Here, Foote satirized the boorish behaviour of English gentlemen abroad. The play garnered wide acclaim and became a part of the repertoires of the Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres where it remained for a few decades. While his success was becoming more solidified as a writer, Foote was also in demand as an actor, working at Drury Lane and Covent Garden during the 1753–4 season.

When he found himself out of work in November 1754, Foote rented the Haymarket theatre and began to stage mock lectures. Satirizing Charles Macklin&#x27;s newly opened school of oratory, these lectures created a sort of theatrical war, especially when Macklin began to appear at the lectures himself. At one particular lecture, Foote extemporized a piece of nonsense prose to test Macklin&#x27;s assertion that he could memorise any text at a single reading.
So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming up the street, pops its head into the shop. &quot;What! No soap?&quot; So he died, and she very imprudently married the barber; and there were present the Picninnies, and the Joblillies, and the Garyulies, and the grand Panjandrum himself, with the little round button at top, and they all fell to playing the game of catch-as-catch-can till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots.

This introduced the nonsense term &quot;The Grand Panjandrum&quot; into the English language and the name was adopted for the Panjandrum or Great Panjandrum, an experimental World War II-era explosive device.

With Foote&#x27;s success in writing &quot;An Englishman in Paris&quot;, Irish playwright Arthur Murphy was moved to create a sequel, &quot;The Englishman returned from Paris&quot;. While Foote readily encouraged Murphy&#x27;s plan, Foote secretly wrote his own version which opened at Covent Garden on 3 February 1756. While early biographers scorned Foote&#x27;s plagiarism of Murphy&#x27;s play, the 1969 discovery of that manuscript laid it to rest when it was proven that Foote&#x27;s play was far superior. The play was successful at Covent Garden and played regularly until 1760.

Two rival actresses captured the attention of London audiences and Foote&#x27;s satire. Peg Woffington and George Anne Bellamy apparently took their roles rather seriously in a production of Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Rival Queens&quot;. When Bellamy&#x27;s Parisian fashions began to upstage Woffington, Bellamy was driven offstage by a dagger-wielding Woffington thus providing a source for Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Green-Room Squabble or a Battle Royal between the Queen of Babylon and the Daughter of Darius&quot;. The text of this farce is now lost.

Having turned his satire on Englishmen abroad and actresses at home, Foote pointed his daggered pen towards himself, other writers and the condition of the &quot;starving writer&quot; in his play &quot;The Author&quot; which premiered at Drury Lane on 5 February 1757. The plot concerned a poor author&#x27;s father who disguises himself in order to spy on his son. Again, Foote created the role of Cadwallader for himself and used it to satirize John Apreece, a patron of authors. While critics derided Foote&#x27;s attack on Apreece, audiences flocked to the theatre. Apreece even appeared and sat &quot;open-mouthed and silly, in the boxes, to the delight of the audience, and mystified by the reflection of himself, which he beheld on the stage.&quot; Foote noted later that Apreece finding &quot;the resemblance [...] too strong, and the ridicule too pungent [...] occasioned an application for the suppression of the piece, which was therefore forbidden to be anymore performed.&quot; The play was forbidden further productions by the Lord Chamberlain. While success may have been limited, Richard Brinsley Sheridan adapted the plot in his &quot;School for Scandal&quot;. Modern critics would point out that &quot;The Author&quot; shows great development in Foote&#x27;s ability in creating characters and sustaining plot.

==Of mimicry and Methodists==

Late in 1757, Foote faced himself in the guise of young actor and mimic, Tate Wilkinson. Wilkinson, like Foote, had failed somewhat as an actor, but was renowned for his satiric mimicry of others. Foote traveled with him to Dublin for part of the 1757–58 season and he also revived &quot;Diversions of the Morning&quot; as a vehicle to display Wilkinson&#x27;s talents. The popularity of these talents crowded out all other performances at Drury Lane in the first half of the season, much to the chagrin of Garrick and the other actors. Soon, however, the luck ran out and by March, Foote was seeking employment elsewhere. With little luck in London, Foote traveled to perform a season in Edinburgh and found success with many of his works, including &quot;The Author&quot; which could not be staged in London. The following season found Foote in Dublin where Wilkinson was drawing crowds with his imitations and on 28 January 1760, Foote opened a new play, &quot;The Minor.&quot; The production was a failure.

Returning to London, Foote&#x27;s financial situation was still quite poor. After renting the Haymarket theatre and revising &quot;The Minor&quot; into a three-act version (up from the two-act version presented in Dublin), the play opened in London. Doran remarks that while &quot;&quot;The Minor&quot; failed in Dublin, very much to the credit of an Irish audience, [...] they condemned it on the ground of its grossness and immorality[,]&quot; English society, nevertheless, while hearing condemnations of the play, filled the theatres. The play played for full houses for 38 nights.

&quot;The Minor&quot; utilizes a fairly pedestrian plot to satirize the Methodist movement. Before its premiere, Foote showed the text of &quot;The Minor&quot; to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker. Secker objected to several passages, but particularly to Mrs Cole referring to herself as a &quot;lost sheep&quot;. This expression, he said, was sacred to the pulpit. Foote besought the archbishop to take the manuscript and strike the exceptionable passages; he agreed on the condition that it should be published &quot;Revised and Corrected by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&quot;

==&quot;The Devil on Two Sticks&quot;==
While riding with Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany in 1766, he was thrown from his horse and the injury cost him his leg. Even in this state, he continued to act and as possible compensation for his injury was granted a license to legally operate the Haymarket Theatre. He produced a summer season of &quot;legitimate plays&quot; in 1767, engaging Spranger Barry and his wife to perform. He bought the theatre outright and remodelled the interior the same year and continued to operate the theatre until he was forced to give up his patent to George Colman the Elder the following year. Near London, Foote lived and wrote in his much loved villa, &#x27;The Hermitage&#x27;, in North End village in the Parish of Fulham. He died on 21 October 1777 in Dover, while en route to France.

One play, &quot;The Cozeners&quot;, is clearly based on the politician Charles James Fox who was a spendthrift and gambler. He had been duped by Elizabeth Harriett Grieve who had promised that she could arrange for him to marry a West Indian heiress. Grieve was tried and transported in 1773 and in the following year The Cozeners opened with Mrs Gardner in the part of Mrs Fleece&#x27;em. Foote&#x27;s satires are based on caricatures of characters and situations from his era. His facility and wit in writing these earned him the title &quot;the English Aristophanes.&quot; While, often, his subjects found his literary jabs just as humorous as his audiences, they often both feared and admired him.

==Legal troubles==
In 1774, the Duke of Kingston&#x27;s sister was able to invalidate the Duke&#x27;s will, on the grounds that his widow, Elizabeth Chudleigh, was guilty of bigamy. Foote picked up this news and began work on a new play in which the character &quot;Lady Kitty Crockodile&quot; was clearly based on Chudleigh. In response a supporter of Chudleigh&#x27;s, William Jackson, in 1775 began publishing in &quot;The Public Ledger&quot; veiled accusations of homosexuality. Not long after Chudleigh was convicted of bigamy in spring 1776, Foote&#x27;s coachman accused Foote of sexual assault, leading to a trial at which Foote was eventually acquitted. In the interim, the &quot;Ledger&quot; filled its pages with the story, and an anonymous pamphlet (likely written by Jackson) aimed at Foote, &quot;Sodom and Onan&quot;, appeared. The work was subtitled &quot;A Satire Inscrib&#x27;d to [ – – ] Esqr, alias the Devil upon Two Sticks&quot;, with the blank filled by an engraving of a foot. Inevitably, these events provided more fodder for Foote&#x27;s pen, with Jackson making a disguised appearance in &quot;The Capuchin&quot;.

==Mentions of Foote==
In William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s 1844 novel &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot;, which was later published as &quot;Barry Lyndon; The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.&quot; the protagonist claims Foote as a friend. Foote is also referred to in &quot;The Brothers Boswell &quot;by Philip Baruth.

<text>A  is a legal device, namely a writ, that is &quot;based upon the presumption that the person summoned was hiding&quot; (see Blackstone.) The word &quot;&quot; is Latin for &quot;he lurks&quot;.

In England, the writ is essentially a summons out of the civil, and in those days, common law-only court, King&#x27;s Bench. It is now defunct, but examples still exist from 1579 and 1791. One example from the 16th century was a writ presented to the Star Chamber, a powerful court operating outside the normal system of law. In that example, the Court of King&#x27;s Bench had issued a writ of latitat directing the King&#x27;s Sheriff to arrest the named person and present them before the court at a specified time and place. The matter had come before the Star Chamber because the arrest had been resisted and the Under-Sheriff (a Crown official) assaulted and a writ of subpoena was now requested. The writ may have arisen in 1566 because at that time there was a &quot;Bill for Latitat for Vexation out of the King&#x27;s Bench&quot; before Parliament and there was another in 1802.

The current practice would be for the issue of a subpoena. If the person concerned failed to appear, the High Court of England and Wales has the power to issue a bench warrant, i.e. a warrant for the arrest of the person concerned, who may then be subject to arrest under that aegis of the Tipstaff and presentation before the court for contempt of court.

<text>Arques () is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France, bordering Saint-Omer.

==Geography==
Arques is situated in the middle of the Hauts-de-France region, 40 km from Calais and Dunkerque, and 45 km from Boulogne-sur-Mer. It lies on the border of the departments of Pas-de-Calais and Nord.

The town is crossed by the Neufossé Canal, which connects the rivers Aa and Lys. The commune also includes several lakes—Beauséjour, Arc-en-ciel, Malhôve, Batavia—and part of the forest of Rihout-Clairmarais.

==History==
Arques is in the region of French Flanders. As this area has been under Belgian, English, French and Spanish rule, many of the names are French versions of names in other languages.

In the wake of the Battle of the Golden Spurs a battle was fought here in April 1303 between French and Flemish. The Flemish were victorious in the Battle of Arques (1303). Arques is not to be confused with Arques-la-Bataille, where the Battle of Arques (1589) took place. It is also close to Agincourt.

It was one of the first towns in the region which subscribed to Agenda 21.

Possible Roman influence

There is a possibility of Arques being the Roman Port of &#x27;Marcae&#x27; mentioned in the Litus Saxonicum as there appears to be research in the UK that the high sea levels were about 4.5 metres higher in late Roman times than that of today.

Arques is between Oudenberg and Boulogne (both Saxon Shore forts) and appears to be land if the sea level is raised 4.5 metres in which case would mean Arques would have been a well protected harbour inland from the town.

==Population==
==Economy==
Arques is famous for its crystal manufacture. It has been the headquarters of Arc International, the largest manufacturer of glassware in the world, since its inception in the 19th century.

==Places of interest==
* The Fontinettes Boat Lift and the Arques lock (l&#x27;écluse des Fontinettes, not to be confused with l&#x27;ecluse de Flandres, a smaller lock, also in Arques)
* Arc International
* The Aa Valley Tourist Railroad (CFTVA: &quot;Chemin de Fer Touristique de la vallée de l&#x27;Aa&quot;) which runs between Arques and Lumbres
* The Audomarais marshes and the Parc naturel régional des caps et marais d&#x27;Opale (a park that runs from the Opal Coast landinwards)
* It is near the Forest of Éperlecques, which houses the Blockhaus d&#x27;Éperlecques
* The local church, château and town hall

There is a town walk which takes in most of these sites and can be downloaded from the town website.

The town is a &quot;ville fleurie&quot; and is rated with three flowers.

La Goudale have relocated to Arques from Douai, to a state of the art brewery which can be visited.

<text>The Advent wreath, or Advent crown, is a Christian tradition that symbolizes the passage of the four weeks of Advent in the liturgical calendar of the Western church. It is traditionally a Lutheran practice, although it has spread to many other Christian denominations.

It is an evergreen wreath with four candles, sometimes with a fifth, white candle in the center. Beginning with the First Sunday of Advent, the lighting of a candle can be accompanied by a Bible reading, devotional time and prayers. An additional candle is lit on each subsequent Sunday until, by the last Sunday of Advent, all four candles are lit. Some Advent wreaths include a fifth, Christ candle which is lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. The custom originated in family settings but has also become widespread in public worship.

==History==
The concept of the Advent wreath originated among German Lutherans in the 16th century. However, it was not until three centuries later that the modern Advent wreath took shape.
Research by Mary Jane Haemig of Luther Seminary, St. Paul, Minnesota, points to Johann Hinrich Wichern (1808–1881), a Lutheran pastor in Germany and a pioneer in urban mission work among the poor, as the inventor of the modern Advent wreath. During Advent, children at the mission school &quot;Rauhes Haus&quot;, founded by Wichern in Hamburg, would ask daily if Christmas had arrived. In 1839, he took a large wooden ring from an old cartwheel and decorated it with 24 small red candles and four large white candles. One small candle was lit successively every weekday and Saturday during Advent, and a large white candle was lit each Sunday. The custom gained ground among Protestant churches in Germany and evolved into the smaller wreath with four or five candles known today. Roman Catholics in Germany began to adopt the custom in the 1920s, and in the 1930s it spread to North America. Haemig&#x27;s research also indicates that the custom did not reach the United States until the 1930s, even among German Lutheran immigrants.

In medieval times, Advent was a period of fasting during which people&#x27;s thoughts were directed to the expected second coming of Christ; but in modern times many have forgotten this meaning and it has instead been primarily seen as the lead up to Christmas, and in that context the Advent wreath serves as a reminder of the approach of the feast.

In 1964, an Advent crown, made at home from wire coathangers and tinsel, appeared on the BBC&#x27;s bi-weekly children&#x27;s TV program &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. This &quot;make&quot; became one of the program&#x27;s most iconic features, repeated each year, and was the introduction of this tradition to most of the broadly Anglican audience. In later years, the candles were replaced by baubles, out of concern for fire safety.

More recently, some Eastern Orthodox families have adopted an Advent wreath with six candles, symbolizing the longer Christmas fast in Orthodox tradition, which corresponds to Advent in Western Christianity.

==Christian symbolism in the Advent wreath==

Advent wreaths are circular, representing God&#x27;s infinite love, and are usually made of evergreen leaves, which &quot;represent the hope of eternal life brought by Jesus Christ&quot;. Within the Advent wreath are candles that generally represent the four weeks of the Advent season as well as &quot;the light of God coming into the world through the birth of Jesus Christ&quot; although each of the candles can be attributed its own significance as well. The four candles of the Advent wreath specifically symbolize the Christian concepts of hope, peace, joy and love, with these candles being lit subsequently throughout each week of the Advent season. Many Advent wreaths also have a white candle in the center, known as the &#x27;Christ candle&#x27;, to symbolize the arrival of Christmastide. It is first lit on Christmas Eve, the beginning of Christmastide, and may be lit throughout the rest of the Christmas season, as well as during Epiphanytide. The Christ candle is white because this is the traditional festal color in the Western Church. An additional layer of meaning names the first candle as the Messiah or Prophecy candle (representing the Jewish prophets who predicted the coming of Jesus), the second is the Bethlehem candle (representing the journey of Joseph and Mary), the third represents the shepherds and their joy, and the fourth is the Angel&#x27;s candle, representing peace.

In many Catholic and Protestant churches, the most popular colors for the four surrounding Advent candles are violet (or blue) and rose, corresponding with the colors of the liturgical vestments for the Sundays of Advent. For denominations of the Western Christian Church, violet is the historic liturgical color for three of the four Sundays of Advent as it is the traditional color of penitential seasons; blue has been historically used too, as it represents hopefulness, reflective of the theme of Advent surrounding the First Coming of Jesus and Second Coming of Jesus. Rose is the liturgical color for the Third Sunday of Advent, known as Gaudete Sunday (from the Latin word meaning &quot;rejoice ye&quot;, the first word of the introit of this Sunday); it is a pause in the penitential spirit of Advent. As such, the third candle, representing joy, is often a different color from the other three.

In other Protestant churches, especially in the United Kingdom, it is more common for Advent wreaths to have four red candles (reflecting their traditional use in Christmas decorations). An Advent wreath given to Pope Benedict XVI of the Catholic Church also had four red candles. In the UK, the four red Advent candles are often linked to the Sunday Revised Common Lectionary readings for Advent, each candle representing those looking forward to the coming of Christ: the hope of all God&#x27;s people (week one), the Old Testament prophets (week two), John the Baptist (week three) and Mary the mother of Jesus (week four).

In &quot;Making God Real in the Orthodox Christian Home&quot;, Anthony Coniaris states that an Eastern Christian wreath consists of six different colored candles on a round base to celebrate the six weeks of the 40-day Advent and Christmas period. A green candle, symbolizing faith, is lit on the first Sunday that begins on November 15; on the second Sunday, a blue candle, symbolizing hope, is lit; on the third Sunday, a gold candle, symbolizing love; on the fourth Sunday, a white candle, symbolizing peace; on the fifth Sunday, a purple candle, symbolizing repentance; on the sixth Sunday, a red candle, symbolizing communion.

<text>White flight or white exodus is the sudden or gradual large-scale migration of white people from areas becoming more racially or ethnoculturally diverse. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, the terms became popular in the United States. They referred to the large-scale migration of people of various European ancestries from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions. The term has more recently been applied to other migrations by whites, from older, inner suburbs to rural areas, as well as from the American Northeast and Midwest to the milder climate in the Southeast and Southwest. The term &#x27;white flight&#x27; has also been used for large-scale post-colonial emigration of whites from Africa, or parts of that continent, driven by levels of violent crime and anti-colonial or anti-white state policies.

Migration of middle-class white populations was observed during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s out of cities such as Baltimore, Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City and Oakland, although racial segregation of public schools had ended there long before the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27; decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954. In the 1970s, attempts to achieve effective desegregation (or &quot;integration&quot;) by means of busing in some areas led to more families&#x27; moving out of former areas. More generally, some historians suggest that white flight occurred in response to population pressures, both from the large migration of blacks from the rural Southern United States to urban cities of the Northern United States and the Western United States in the Great Migration and the waves of new immigrants from around the world. Some historians have challenged the phrase &quot;white flight&quot; as a misnomer whose use should be reconsidered. In her study of West Side in Chicago during the post-war era, historian Amanda Seligman argues that the phrase misleadingly suggests that whites immediately departed when blacks moved into the neighborhood, when in fact, many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics. Leah Boustan, Professor of Economics at Princeton, attributes white flight both to racism and economic reasons. Some historians also cite crime and neighborhood deterioration as significant causes of white flight.

The business practices of redlining, mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants contributed to the overcrowding and physical deterioration of areas with large minority populations. Such conditions are considered to have contributed to the emigration of other populations. The limited facilities for banking and insurance, due to a perceived lack of profitability, and other social services, and extra fees meant to hedge against perceived profit issues, increased their cost to residents in predominantly non-white suburbs and city neighborhoods. According to the environmental geographer Laura Pulido, the historical processes of suburbanization and urban decentralization contribute to contemporary environmental racism.

==History==

In 1870, &quot;The Nation&quot; covered the large-scale migrations of white Americans; &quot;The report of the Emigration Commissioners of Louisiana, for the past year, estimates the white exodus from the Southern Atlantic States, Alabama, and Mississippi, to the trans-Mississippi regions, at scores of thousands&quot;. By 1888, with rhetoric typical of the time, Walter Thomas Mills&#x27;s &quot;The Statesman&quot; publication predicted:
Social and political equality and the political supremacy of the negro element in any southern state must lead to one of three things: A white exodus, a war of races, or the destruction of representative institutions, as in the District of Columbia.

An 1894 biography of William Lloyd Garrison reveals the abolitionist&#x27;s perception of the pre-Civil War tension and how &quot;the shadows of the impending civil disruption, had brought about a white exodus&quot; of Northerners to Southern states such as Georgia.

In the years leading up to World War I, the newspapers in the Union of South Africa were reporting on the &quot;spectre of white flight&quot;, in particular due to Afrikaners travelling to the Port of Durban in search of ships for Britain and Australia.

==Academic research==
In 1958, political scientist Morton Grodzins identified that &quot;once the proportion of non-whites exceeds the limits of the neighborhood&#x27;s tolerance for interracial living, whites move out.&quot; Grodzins termed this phenomenon the tipping point in the study of white flight.

In 2004, a study of UK census figures at the London School of Economics demonstrated evidence of white flight, resulting in ethnic minorities in inner-city areas becoming increasingly isolated from the ethnic White British population. The study, which examined the white population in London, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester between 1991 and 2001, also concluded that white population losses were largest in areas with the highest ethnic minority populations.

In 2018, research at Indiana University showed that between 2000 and 2010 in the US, of a sample size of 27,891 Census tracts, 3,252 experienced &quot;white flight&quot;. The examined areas had &quot;an average magnitude loss of 40 percent of the original white population.&quot; Published in &quot;Social Science Research&quot;, the study found &quot;relative to poorer neighborhoods, white flight becomes systematically more likely in middle-class neighborhoods at higher thresholds of black, Hispanic, and Asian population presence.&quot;

===Checkerboard and tipping models===
In studies in the 1980s and 1990s, blacks said they were willing to live in neighborhoods with 50/50 ethnic composition. Whites were also willing to live in integrated neighborhoods, but preferred proportions of more whites. Despite this willingness to live in integrated neighborhoods, the majority still live in largely segregated neighborhoods, which have continued to form.

In 1969, Nobel Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling published &quot;Models of Segregation&quot;, a paper in which he demonstrated through a &quot;checkerboard model&quot; and mathematical analysis, that even when every agent prefers to live in a mixed-race neighborhood, almost complete segregation of neighborhoods emerges as individual decisions accumulate. In his &quot;tipping model&quot;, he showed that members of an ethnic group do not move out of a neighborhood as long as the proportion of other ethnic groups is relatively low, but if a critical level of other ethnicities is exceeded, the original residents may make rapid decisions and take action to leave. This tipping point is viewed as simply the end-result of a domino effect originating when the threshold of the majority ethnicity members with the highest sensitivity to sameness is exceeded. If these people leave and are either not replaced or replaced by other ethnicities, then this in turn raises the level of mixing of neighbors, exceeding the departure threshold for additional people.

==Africa==

===South Africa===
About 800,000 out of an earlier total population of 5.2 million whites left post-apartheid South Africa after 1995, according to a 2009 report in Newsweek. The country has suffered a high rate of violent crime, a primary stated reason for emigration. Other causes cited in the Newsweek report include attacks against white farmers, concern about being excluded by affirmative action programmes, political instability and worries about corruption. Many of those who leave are highly educated, resulting in skills shortages. Some observers fear the long-term consequences, as South Africa&#x27;s labour policies make it difficult to attract skilled immigrants. In the global economy, some professionals and skilled people have been attracted to work in the U.S. and European nations.

===Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia)===

Until 1980, the unrecognised Republic of Rhodesia held a well-publicised image as being one of two nations in sub-Saharan Africa where a white minority of European descent and culture held political, economic, and social control over a preponderantly black African majority. Nevertheless, unlike white South Africans, a significant percentage of white Rhodesians represented recent immigrants from Europe. After World War II, there was a substantial influx of Europeans migrating into the region (formerly known as Southern Rhodesia), including former residents of India, Pakistan, and other parts of Africa. Also represented were working-class emigrants responding to economic opportunities. In 1969, only 41% of Rhodesia&#x27;s white community were natural-born citizens, or 93,600 people. The remainder were naturalised European and South African citizens or expatriates, with many holding dual citizenship.

During the Rhodesian Bush War, almost the entire white male population between eighteen and fifty-eight was affected by various military commitments, and individuals spent up to five or six months of the year on combat duty away from their normal occupations in the civil service, commerce, industry, or agriculture. These long periods of service in the field led to an increased emigration of men of military age. In November 1963, state media cited the chief reasons for emigration as uncertainty about the future, economic decline due to embargo and war, and the heavy commitments of national service, which was described as &quot;the overriding factor causing people to leave&quot;. Of the male emigrants in 1976 about half fell into the 15 to 39 age bracket. Between 1960 and 1976 160,182 whites immigrated, while 157,724 departed. This dynamic turnover rate led to depressions in the property market, a slump in the construction industry, and a decline in retail sales. The number of white Rhodesians peaked in 1975 at 278,000, and rapidly declined as the bush war intensified. In 1976, around 14,000 whites left the country, marking the first year since Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 that more whites had left the country than arrived, with most leaving for South Africa. This became known as the &#x27;chicken run&#x27;, the earliest use of which was recorded the following year, often by Rhodesians who remained to contemptuously describe those who had left. Other phrases such as &#x27;taking the gap&#x27; or &#x27;gapping it&#x27; were also used. As the outward flow increased, the phrase &#x27;owl run&#x27; also came into use, as leaving the country was deemed by many to be a wise choice. Disfavour with the biracial Zimbabwe Rhodesia administration in 1979 also contributed to a mass exodus.

The establishment of the Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded the death knell for white political power, and ushered in a new era of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and the provocative attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had a greater impact on the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year. A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe&#x27;s violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country.

From a strictly economic point of view, the departure figures were not as significant as the loss of the skills of those leaving. A disproportionate number of white Zimbabwean emigrants were well educated and highly skilled. Among those living in the United States, for example, 53.7% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree, while only 2% had not completed secondary school. Most (52.4%) had occupied technical or supervisory positions of critical importance to the modern sector of the economy. Inasmuch as black workers did not begin making large inroads into apprenticeships and other training programs until the 1970s, few were in a position to replace their white colleagues in the 1980s.

==Europe==

===Denmark===
A study of school choice in Copenhagen found that an immigrant proportion of below 35% in the local schools did not affect parental choice of schools. If the percentage of immigrant children rose above this level, Danes are far more likely to choose other schools. Immigrants who speak Danish at home also opt out. Other immigrants, often more recent ones, stay with local schools.

===Finland===
In Finland, white flight has been observed in districts where the share of non-Finnish population is 20% or above. In Greater Helsinki region, there are more than 30 such districts. Those include e.g. Kallahti in Helsinki, Suvela in Espoo, and Länsimäki in Vantaa. Outside the Greater Helsinki region, the phenomenon has been witnessed at least in Varissuo district of Turku.

===Ireland===
A 2007 government report stated that immigration in Dublin has caused &quot;dramatic&quot; white flight from elementary schools in a studied area (Dublin 15). 27% of residents were foreign-born immigrants. The report stated that Dublin was risking creating immigrant-dominated &quot;banlieues&quot;, on the outskirts of a city, similar to such areas in France. The immigrants in the area included Eastern Europeans (such as those from Poland), Asians, and Africans (mainly from Nigeria).

===Norway===
White flight in Norway has increased since the 1970s, with the immigration of non-Scandinavians from (in numerical order, starting with the largest): Poland, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, Vietnam, Iran, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, the former Yugoslavia, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Lithuania. By June 2009, more than 40% of Oslo schools had an immigrant majority, with some schools having a 97% immigrant share. Schools in Oslo are increasingly divided by ethnicity. For instance, in the Groruddalen (Grorud valley), four boroughs which currently have a population of around 165,000 saw the ethnic Norwegian population decrease by 1,500 in 2008, while the immigrant population increased by 1,600. In thirteen years, a total of 18,000 ethnic Norwegians have moved from the borough.

In January 2010, a news feature from &quot;Dagsrevyen&quot; on the public Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation said, &quot;Oslo has become a racially divided city. In some city districts the racial segregation starts already in kindergarten.&quot; Reporters said, &quot;In the last years the brown schools have become browner, and the white schools whiter,&quot; a statement which caused a minor controversy.

===Sweden===
After the Second World War, immigration into Sweden occurred in three phases. The first was a direct result of the war, with refugees from concentration camps and surrounding countries in Scandinavia and Northern Europe. The second, prior to 1970, involved immigrant workers, mainly from Finland, Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia. In the most recent phase, from the 1970s onwards, refugees immigrated from the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, joined later by their relatives.

A study which mapped patterns of segregation and congregation of incoming population groups found that, if a majority group is reluctant to accept a minority influx, they may leave the district, avoid the district, or use tactics to keep the minority out. The minority group in turn react by either dispersing or congregating, avoiding certain districts in turn. Detailed analysis of data from the 1990s onwards indicates that the concentration of immigrants in certain city districts, such as Husby in Stockholm and Rosengård in Malmö, is in part due to an immigration influx, but primarily caused by white flight.

According to researcher Emma Neuman at Linnaeus University, the white flight phenomenon commences when the fraction of non-European immigrants reaches 3-4%, but European immigration shows no such effect. High income earners and the highly educated move out first, so the ethnic segregation also leads to class segregation.

In a study performed at Örebro University, mothers of young children were interviewed to study attitudes on Swedishness, multiculturalism and segregation. It concluded that while many expressed values such as ethnic diversity being an enriching factor, when, in practice, it came to choosing schools or choosing which district to move to, ensuring the children had access to a school with a robust Swedish majority was also a consideration. This was because they did not want their children to grow up in a school where they were a minority, and wanted them to be in a good environment for learning the Swedish language.

===United Kingdom===
For centuries, London was the destination for refugees and immigrants from continental Europe. Although all the immigrants were European, neighborhoods showed ethnic succession over time, as older residents moved out and new immigrants moved in, an early case of white flight (though the majority of London&#x27;s population was still ethnic British).

In the 2001 census, the London boroughs of Newham and Brent were found to be the first areas to have non-white majorities. The 2011 census found that, for the first time, less than 50% of London&#x27;s population were white British, and that in some areas of London white British people make up less than 20% of the population. A 2005 report stated that white migration within the UK is mainly from areas with a high ethnic minority population to those with predominantly white populations; white British families have moved out of London, as many immigrants have settled in the capital. The report&#x27;s writers expressed concern about British social cohesion, and stated that different ethnic groups were living &quot;parallel lives&quot;; they were concerned that lack of contact between the groups could result in fear more readily exploited by extremists. In a study, the London School of Economics found similar results. A 2016 BBC documentary, &quot;Last Whites of the East End&quot;, covered the migration of whites from Newham to Essex. A 2019 &quot;Guardian&quot; article stated that &quot;came to represent &#x27;white flight&#x27; in the UK&quot;, and a 2013 &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine article gave Essex as an example of white flight.

Researcher Ludi Simpson has stated that the growth of ethnic minorities in Britain is due mostly to natural population growth (births outnumbering deaths), rather than immigration. Both white and non-white Britons who can do so economically are equally likely to leave mixed-race inner-city areas. In his opinion, these trends indicate counter urbanisation, rather than white flight.

==North America==

===Canada===

====Toronto====
In 2013, the Toronto Star examined the &quot;identity crisis&quot; of Brampton (a suburban city in the Greater Toronto Area), and referring to white Canadians, the &quot;loss of more than 23,000 people, or 12 per cent, in a decade when the city&#x27;s population rose by 60 per cent&quot;. The paper reported University of Manitoba sociologist Jason Edgerton&#x27;s analysis that &quot;After you control for retirement, low birth rate, etc. some of the other (shrinkage) could be white flight — former mainstream communities not comfortable being the minority.&quot;

A 2016 article from &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, addressing the diversity of Brampton, acknowledged that while academics in Canada are sometimes reluctant to use the term of white flight, it reported that:
[...] the Brampton story reveals that we have our own version of white flight, and before we figure out how to manage hyper-diverse and increasingly polarized cities like Greater Toronto, we need to reflect on our own attitudes about race and ethnic diversity.

In 2018, &quot;The Guardian&quot; covered the white flight that had occurred in Brampton, and how the suburban city had been nicknamed &quot;Bramladesh&quot; and &quot;Browntown&quot;, due to its &quot;73% visible minority, with its largest ethnic group Indian&quot;. It was also reported how &quot;the white population fell from 192,400 in 2001 to 169,230 in 2011, and now hovers around 151,000.&quot;

====Vancouver====

In 2014, the Vancouver Sun addressed the issue of white flight across Metropolitan Vancouver. Detailing the phenomenon of &quot;unconscious segregation&quot;, the article points to large East Asian and South Asian enclaves within Greater Vancouver such as Burnaby, East Vancouver, Richmond, South Vancouver and Surrey. In contrast, other cities and neighbourhoods within the metropolitan region such as Tsawwassen, South Surrey, White Rock and Langley host equally large white enclaves.

===United States===

In the United States during the 1940s, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, low-cost mortgages through the G.I. Bill, and residential redlining enabled white families to abandon inner cities in favor of suburban living and prevent ethnic minorities from doing the same. The result was severe urban decay that, by the 1960s, resulted in crumbling &quot;ghettos&quot;. Prior to national data available in the 1950 US census, a migration pattern of disproportionate numbers of whites moving from cities to suburban communities was easily dismissed as merely anecdotal. Because American urban populations were still substantially growing, a relative decrease in one racial or ethnic component eluded scientific proof to the satisfaction of policy makers. In essence, data on urban population change had not been separated into what are now familiarly identified its &quot;components.&quot; The first data set potentially capable of proving &quot;white flight&quot; was the 1950 census. But original processing of this data, on older-style tabulation machines by the US Census Bureau, failed to attain any approved level of statistical proof. It was rigorous reprocessing of the same raw data on a UNIVAC I, led by Donald J. Bogue of the Scripps Foundation and Emerson Seim of the University of Chicago, that scientifically established the reality of white flight.

It was not simply a more powerful calculating instrument that placed the reality of white flight beyond a high hurdle of proof seemingly required for policy makers to consider taking action. Also instrumental were new statistical methods developed by Emerson Seim for disentangling deceptive counter-effects that had resulted when numerous cities reacted to departures of a wealthier tax base by annexation. In other words, central cities had been bringing back their new suburbs, such that families that had departed from inner cities were not even being counted as having moved from the cities.

During the later 20th century, industrial restructuring led to major losses of jobs, leaving formerly middle-class working populations suffering poverty, with some unable to move away and seek employment elsewhere. Real estate prices often fall in areas of economic erosion, allowing persons with lower income to establish homes in such areas. Since the 1960s and changed immigration laws, the United States has received immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America, Asia, and Africa. Immigration has changed the demographics of both cities and suburbs, and the US has become a largely suburban nation, with the suburbs becoming more diverse. In addition, Latinos, the fastest growing minority group in the US, began to migrate away from traditional entry cities and to cities in the Southwest, such as Albuquerque, Phoenix and Tucson. In 2006, the increased number of Latinos had made whites a minority group in some western cities.

====Catalysts====

=====Legal exclusion=====
In the 1930s, states outside the South (where racial segregation was legal) practiced unofficial segregation via exclusionary covenants in title deeds and real estate neighborhood redlining – explicit, legally sanctioned racial discrimination in real property ownership and lending practices. Blacks were effectively barred from pursuing homeownership, even when they were able to afford it. Suburban expansion was reserved for middle-class and working-class white people, facilitated by their increased wages incurred by the war effort and by subsequent federally guaranteed mortgages (VA, FHA, HOLC) available only to whites to buy new houses, such as those created by the Federal Housing Administration. In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants could not constitutionaly be enforced by the states.

=====Roads=====
After World War II, aided by the construction of the Interstate Highway System, many white Americans began leaving industrial cities for new housing in suburbs. The roads served to transport suburbanites to their city jobs, facilitating the development of suburbs, and shifting the tax base away from the city. This may have exacerbated urban decay. In some cases, such as in the Southern United States, local governments used highway road constructions to deliberately divide and isolate black neighborhoods from goods and services, often within industrial corridors. In Birmingham, Alabama, the local government used the highway system to perpetuate the racial residence-boundaries the city established with a 1926 racial zoning law. Constructing interstate highways through majority-black neighborhoods eventually reduced the populations to the poorest proportion of people financially unable to leave their destroyed community.

=====Blockbusting=====

The real estate business practice of &quot;blockbusting&quot; was a for-profit catalyst for white flight, and a means to control non-white migration. By subterfuge, real estate agents would facilitate black people buying a house in a white neighborhood, either by buying the house themselves, or via a white proxy buyer, and then re-selling it to the black family. The remaining white inhabitants (alarmed by real estate agents and the local news media), fearing devalued residential property, would quickly sell, usually at a loss. The realtors profited from these &quot;en masse&quot; sales and the ability to resell to the incoming black families, through arbitrage and the sales commissions from both groups. By such tactics, the racial composition of a neighborhood population was often changed completely in a few years.

=====Association with urban decay=====

Urban decay is the sociological process whereby a city, or part of a city, falls into disrepair and decrepitude. Its characteristics are depopulation, economic restructuring, abandoned buildings, high local unemployment (and thus poverty), fragmented families, political disenfranchisement, crime, and a desolate, inhospitable city landscape. White flight contributed to the draining of cities&#x27; tax bases when middle-class people left. Abandoned properties attracted criminals and street gangs, contributing to crime.

In the 1970s and 1980s, urban decay was associated with Western cities, especially in North America and parts of Europe. In that time, major structural changes in global economies, transportation, and government policy created the economic, then social, conditions resulting in urban decay.

White flight in North America started to reverse in the 1990s, when the rich suburbanites returned to cities, gentrifying the decayed urban neighborhoods.

=====Government-aided white flight=====

New municipalities were established beyond the abandoned city&#x27;s jurisdiction to avoid the legacy costs of maintaining city infrastructures; instead new governments spent taxes to establish suburban infrastructures. The federal government contributed to white flight and the early decay of non-white city neighborhoods by withholding maintenance capital mortgages, thus making it difficult for the communities to either retain or attract middle-class residents.

The new suburban communities limited the emigration of poor and non-white residents from the city by restrictive zoning; thus, few lower-middle-class people could afford a house in the suburbs. Many all-white suburbs were eventually annexed to the cities their residents had left. For instance, Milwaukee, Wisconsin partially annexed towns such as Granville; the (then) mayor, Frank P. Zeidler, complained about the socially destructive &quot;Iron Ring&quot; of new municipalities incorporated in the post–World War II decade. Analogously, semi-rural communities, such as Oak Creek, South Milwaukee, and Franklin, formally incorporated as discrete entities to escape urban annexation. Wisconsin state law had allowed Milwaukee&#x27;s annexation of such rural and suburban regions that did not qualify for discrete incorporation per the legal incorporation standards.

=====Desegregation of schools=====

In some areas, the post–World War II racial desegregation of the public schools catalyzed white flight. In 1954, the US Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) ordered the &quot;de jure&quot; termination of the &quot;separate, but equal&quot; legal racism established with the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896) case in the 19th century. It declared that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Many southern jurisdictions mounted massive resistance to the policy. In some cases, white parents withdrew their children from public schools and established private religious schools instead. These schools, termed segregation academies, sprung up in the American South between the late 1950s and mid-1970s and allowed parents to prevent their children from being enrolled in racially mixed schools.

Upon desegregation in 1957 in Baltimore, Maryland, the Clifton Park Junior High School had 2,023 white students and 34 black students; ten years later, it had twelve white students and 2,037 black students. In northwest Baltimore, Garrison Junior High School&#x27;s student body declined from 2,504 whites and twelve blacks to 297 whites and 1,263 blacks in that period. At the same time, the city&#x27;s working class population declined because of the loss of industrial jobs as heavy industry restructured.

In &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; (1971), the Supreme Court ordered the desegregation busing of poor black students to suburban white schools, and suburban white students to the city to try to integrate student populations. In &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; (1974), the dissenting Justice William Douglas observed, &quot;The inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly black; and the blacks, we know, in many instances are likely to be poorer.&quot; Likewise, in 1977, the Federal decision in &quot;Penick v. The Columbus Board of Education&quot; (1977) accelerated white flight from Columbus, Ohio. Although the racial desegregation of schools affected only public school districts, the most vehement opponents of racial desegregation have sometimes been whites whose children attended private schools.

A secondary, non-geographic consequence of school desegregation and busing was &quot;cultural&quot; white flight: withdrawing white children from the mixed-race public school system and sending them to private schools unaffected by US federal integration laws. In 1970, when the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Pasadena Unified School District desegregated, the proportion of white students (54%) reflected the school district&#x27;s proportion of whites (53%). Once the federally ordered school desegregation began, whites who could afford private schools withdrew their children from the racially diverse Pasadena public school system. By 2004, Pasadena had 63 private schools educating some 33% of schoolchildren, while white students made up only 16% of the public school populace. The Pasadena Unified School District superintendent characterized public schools as &quot;like the bogey-man&quot; to whites. He implemented policies to attract white parents to the racially diverse Pasadena public school district.

===== Crime =====
Studies suggest that rising crime rates were one of the reasons that white households left cities for suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Samuel Kye (2018) cites several studies that identified &quot;factors such as crime and neighborhood deterioration, rather than racial prejudice, as more robust determinants of white flight&quot;. Ellen and O&#x27;Regan (2010) found that lower crime rates in city centers are associated with less out-migration to suburbs, but they did not find an effect on lower levels of crime attracting new households to the city.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
In Sydney, Australian-born minority (white and non-white) people in Fairfield and Canterbury fell by three percentage points, six percentage points in Auburn, and three percentage points in Strathfield between 1991 and 1996. Only in Liverpool, one of the more fast growth areas of Sydney, did both the Australia-born and overseas-born male population increase over the 1991-1996 period. However, the rate of growth of the overseas-born was far greater than that of the Australia-born, thus the sharp increase in Liverpool&#x27;s population share from 43.5 per cent to 49 per cent by 1996. The Australia-born movers from the south-western suburbs relocated to Penrith in the northwest and Gosford and Wyong in the northeast.

According to the New South Wales Secondary Principals Council and the University of Western Sydney, public schools in that state have experienced white flight to private and Catholic schools wherever there is a large presence of Aboriginal and Middle Eastern students.

In 2018, NSW Labor Opposition leader Luke Foley talked about White flight in Fairfield, where he stated that Iraqi and Syrian refugees are replacing the Anglo-Australians in the suburb, although he later apologised for the comments.

===New Zealand===

White flight has been observed in low socioeconomic decile schools in New Zealand. Data from the Ministry of Education found that 60,000 New Zealand European students attended low-decile schools (situated in the poorest areas) in 2000, and had fallen to half that number in 2010. The same data also found that high-decile schools (which are in the wealthiest areas) had a corresponding increase in New Zealand European students. The Ministry claimed demographic changes were behind the shifts, but teacher and principal associations have attributed white flight to racial and class stigmas of low-decile schools, which commonly have majority Maori and Pacific Islander rolls.

In one specific case, white flight has significantly affected Sunset Junior High School in a suburb of the city of Rotorua, with the total number of students reduced from 700 to 70 in the early 1980s. All but one of the 70 students are Maori. The area has a concentration of poor, low-skilled people, with struggling families, and many single mothers. Related to the social problems of the families, student educational achievement is low on the standard reading test.

<text>Heinrich Harrer (; 6 July 1912 – 7 January 2006) was an Austrian mountaineer, explorer, writer, sportsman, geographer, and briefly SS sergeant. He was a member of the four-man climbing team that made the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger, the &quot;last problem&quot; of the Alps, in July 1938. Harrer and the team flew the Nazi flag atop the mountain. Harrer had joined the Nazi Party shortly after the annexation of Austria in March 1938, and was personally received by Hitler after the climb. A year later in 1939, he and the climbing team went on an expedition to the Indian Himalayas, where they were arrested by British colonial authorities due to the outbreak of World War II. He eventually escaped to Tibet, staying there until 1951 and never seeing active combat from that point onwards. He wrote the books &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1952) and &quot;The White Spider&quot; (1959).

==Early life==
Heinrich Harrer was born 6 July 1912 in Hüttenberg, Austria, in the district of Sankt Veit an der Glan in the state of Carinthia. His father, Josef Harrer, was a postal worker. From 1933 to 1938, Harrer studied geography and sports at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz. Harrer became a member of the traditional student corporation ATV Graz.

In 1935, Harrer was designated to participate in the Alpine skiing competition at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The Austrian Alpine skiing team, however, boycotted the event due to a conflict regarding the skiing instructors&#x27; status as professionals. As a result, Harrer did not participate.

In 1937, Harrer won the downhill event at the World Student Championships at Zell am See.

==Eiger North Face==
Mountain climbing was Harrer&#x27;s true passion. Knowing an extraordinary feat of climbing could win him a place on a Himalayan expedition, Harrer and a friend, Fritz Kasparek, resolved to be the first to climb the North Face of the Eiger (3,967 m, 13,025 ft) in Switzerland. The near vertical wall, with its ice-field known as The White Spider, had claimed several lives; and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it. Following his final university exams in July 1938, Harrer and Kasparek traveled to Kleine Scheidegg at the foot of the Eiger and set out on their climb. Halfway up the mountain, Harrer and Kasparek encountered another team making the attempt, Ludwig Vörg and Anderl Heckmair from Germany. The four decided to make the rest of the climb as a single team, with the experienced Heckmair leading.
Throughout the climb, the four men were constantly threatened by snow avalanches and rock falls. They were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the White Spider on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon 24 July 1938. This first ascent of the Eiger North Face was described by Italian climber Reinhold Messner as &quot;a glorious moment in the history of mountaineering and a great sensation, since several climbers had previously perished on the Face&quot;, made headlines around the world, and is recounted in Harrer&#x27;s book &quot;The White Spider&quot;, published in 1959.

==Nazi involvement==
In 1996, ORF editor and filmmaker Gerald Lehner found in American archives the membership card of Harrer, who joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in October 1933. After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of March 1938, as Germany annexed Austria, he joined the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) on 1 April. He held the rank of &quot;Oberscharführer&quot; (Sergeant), and on 1 May he became a member of the Nazi Party. After their ascent of the Eiger North Face, the four climbers were received by and photographed with Adolf Hitler. Harrer later said he wore his SS uniform only once, on the day of his marriage to Charlotte Wegener, daughter of the eminent explorer and scholar Alfred Wegener. After returning to Europe in 1952, Harrer was cleared of any pre-war crimes and this was later supported by Simon Wiesenthal. In his memoir, &quot;Beyond Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, Harrer called his involvement with the Nazi Party a mistake made in his youth, when he had not yet learned to think for himself.

==Internment in India==
In 1939, Harrer joined a four-man expedition, led by Peter Aufschnaiter, to the Diamir Face of the Nanga Parbat with the aim of finding an easier route to the peak. Having concluded that the face was viable, the four mountaineers were in Karachi, India at the end of August, waiting for a freighter to take them home. The ship being long overdue, Harrer, Ludwig, and Hans Lobenhoffer tried to reach Persia (Iran), but several hundred kilometres north-west of Karachi they were arrested by British colonial authorities as enemy aliens and escorted back to Karachi, where Aufschnaiter had stayed. Two days later, war was declared, and on 3 September 1939 all were put behind barbed wire to be transferred to a detention camp at Ahmednagar near Bombay. They considered escaping to Portuguese Goa, but when further transferred to Dehradun to be detained there for years with 1,000 other enemy aliens, they found Tibet more promising, the final goal being the Japanese front in Burma or China.

Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped and were re-captured a number of times before finally succeeding. On 29 April 1944, Harrer and six others, including Rolf Magener and Heins von Have (disguised as British officers), Aufschnaiter, the Salzburger Bruno Treipel (aka Treipl) and the Berliners Hans Kopp and Sattler (disguised as native Indian workers), walked out of the camp. Magener and von Have took the train to Calcutta and from there found their way to the Japanese army in Burma.

The others headed for the closest border via Landour. After Sattler gave up on 10 May, the remaining four entered Tibet on 17 May 1944, crossing the Tsang Chok-la Pass (5,896 m, 19,350 ft) and thereafter split into two groups: Harrer and Kopp, Aufschnaiter and Treipel. On 17 June, Treipel, exhausted, bought himself a horse and rode back to the lowlands. Several months later, when the remaining three were still without visas for Tibet, Kopp also gave up and left for Nepal (where he was handed over to British colonial authorities within a few days).

==Seven years in Tibet==

Aufschnaiter and Harrer, helped by the former&#x27;s knowledge of the Tibetan language, proceeded to Tibet&#x27;s capital city, Lhasa, which they reached on 15 January 1946 (eight months after Nazi Germany&#x27;s surrender), having crossed Western Tibet, the South-West with Gyirong County, and the Northern Changthang.

In 1948, Harrer became a salaried official of the Tibetan government, translating foreign news and acting as the Court photographer. Harrer first met the 14th Dalai Lama when he was summoned to the Potala Palace and asked to make a film about ice skating, which Harrer had introduced to Tibet. Harrer built a cinema for him, with a projector run off a Jeep engine. Harrer soon became the Dalai Lama&#x27;s tutor in English, geography, and some science, and Harrer was astonished at how fast his pupil absorbed the Western world&#x27;s knowledge. They shared the same birthday and a strong friendship developed between the two that would last the rest of Harrer&#x27;s life.

In 1952, Harrer returned to Austria where he documented his experiences in the books &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1952) and &quot;Lost Lhasa&quot; (1953). &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; was translated into 53 languages, and was a bestseller in the United States in 1954, selling three million copies. The book was the basis of two films of the same title, the first in 1956 and the second in 1997, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Harrer.

In &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, Harrer wrote:
==Later adventures==
Following his return from Tibet, Harrer settled down in Kitzbühel, Austria, and later in Liechtenstein. He took part in a number of ethnographic as well as mountaineering expeditions to Alaska, the Andes, and the Mountains of the Moon in central Africa. In 1953 he explored the source of the Amazon River and made a first ascent of Ausangate (6384 m). In 1954, some with German-American Fred Beckey, Harrer made the first ascents of Mount Deborah (3,761 m, 12,339 ft), Mount Hunter (4,442 m, 14,573 ft), and Mount Drum (3661 m), all in Alaska. In 1957, he explored the Congo River with the former king Leopold III of Belgium.

In February 1962, he was the leader of the team of four climbers who made the first ascent of the Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m, 16,024 ft; later named Puncak Jaya) on Papua, Indonesia (then Dutch New Guinea), the highest peak in Oceania and one of the Seven Summits. This and his pioneering expedition to reach the Neolithic stone axe quarries at Ya-Li-Me are recorded in his memoir &quot;I Come from the Stone Age&quot;.

In 1966, he met the Xingu Indians of Brazil&#x27;s Mato Grosso. In 1972, Harrer crossed the island of Borneo. He also made expeditions to Nepal, French Guiana, Greenland, Sudan, India, Ladakh, Andaman Islands, Uganda, Kenya and Bhutan.

Harrer wrote more than 20 books about his adventures, some including photographs considered to be among the best records of traditional Tibetan culture. Harrer was also an excellent golfer, winning Austrian national championships in 1958 and 1970.

==Private life==

In December 1938, Harrer married Lotte Wegener (1920–1989), the daughter of Alfred Wegener, German polar researcher and originator of the theory of continental drift. Her father had died on a Greenland expedition when she was 10. Their son Peter Harrer was born in December 1939, three months after Harrer was arrested by the British. Their marriage was dissolved in 1943 while he was still in India. In 1953, he married Margaretha Truxa (divorce in 1958), and in 1962 he married Katharina (Carina) Haarhaus (1922–2014), who remained his wife until his death.

==Final years==

In the early 1980s, he visited Tibet again, and wrote a sequel to &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, titled &quot;Return to Tibet: Tibet After the Chinese Occupation&quot;. The Kirkus Review of his sequel said: He later wrote his autobiography published in English as &quot;Beyond Seven Years in Tibet&quot; in 2007. He made approximately 40 documentary films and founded the Heinrich Harrer Museum in Hüttenberg, Austria dedicated to Tibet. In October 2002, the Dalai Lama presented Harrer with the International Campaign for Tibet&#x27;s Light of Truth Award for his efforts to bring the situation in Tibet to international attention. Harrer died on 7 January 2006 in Friesach, Austria at the age of 93.

<text>Coral bleaching is the process when corals become white due to loss of symbiotic algae and photosynthetic pigments. This loss of pigment can be caused by various stressors, such as changes in temperature, light, or nutrients. Bleaching occurs when coral polyps expel the zooxanthellae (dinoflagellates that are commonly referred to as algae) that live inside their tissue, causing the coral to turn white. The zooxanthellae are photosynthetic, and as the water temperature rises, they begin to produce reactive oxygen species. This is toxic to the coral, so the coral expels the zooxanthellae. Since the zooxanthellae produce the majority of coral colouration, the coral tissue becomes transparent, revealing the coral skeleton made of calcium carbonate. Most bleached corals appear bright white, but some are blue, yellow, or pink due to pigment proteins in the coral.

The leading cause of coral bleaching is rising ocean temperatures due to climate change caused by anthropogenic activities. A temperature about 1 °C (or 2 °F) above average can cause bleaching.The ocean takes in a large portion of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by human activity. Although this uptake helps regulate global warming, it is also changing the chemistry of the ocean in ways never seen before. Ocean acidification (OA) is the decline in seawater pH caused by absorption of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This decrease in seawater pH has a significant effect on marine ecosystems.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, between 2014 and 2016, the longest recorded global bleaching events killed coral on an unprecedented scale. In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed 29 to 50 percent of the reef&#x27;s coral. In 2017, the bleaching extended into the central region of the reef. The average interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016. The world&#x27;s most bleaching-tolerant corals can be found in the southern Persian/Arabian Gulf. Some of these corals bleach only when water temperatures exceed ~35 °C.

Bleached corals continue to live, but they are more vulnerable to disease and starvation. Zooxanthellae provide up to 90 percent of the coral&#x27;s energy, so corals are deprived of nutrients when zooxanthellae are expelled. Some corals recover if conditions return to normal, and some corals can feed themselves. However, the majority of coral without zooxanthellae starve.

Normally, coral polyps live in an endosymbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae. This relationship is crucial for the health of the coral and the reef, which provide shelter for approximately 25% of all marine life. In this relationship, the coral provides the zooxanthellae with shelter. In return, the zooxanthellae provide compounds that give energy to the coral through photosynthesis. This relationship has allowed coral to survive for at least 210 million years in nutrient-poor environments. Coral bleaching is caused by the breakdown of this relationship.

== Process ==


The corals that form the great reef ecosystems of tropical seas depend upon a symbiotic relationship with algae-like single-celled flagellate protozoa called zooxanthellae that live within their tissues and give the coral its coloration. The zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients through photosynthesis, a crucial factor in the clear and nutrient-poor tropical waters. In exchange, the coral provides the zooxanthellae with the carbon dioxide and ammonium needed for photosynthesis. Negative environmental conditions, such as abnormally warm or cool temperatures, high light, and even some microbial diseases, can lead to the breakdown of the coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis. To ensure short-term survival, the coral-polyp then consumes or expels the zooxanthellae. This leads to a lighter or completely white appearance, hence the term &quot;bleached&quot;. Under mild stress conditions, some corals may appear bright blue, pink, purple, or yellow instead of white, due to the continued or increased presence of the coral cells&#x27; intrinsic pigment molecules, a phenomenon known as &quot;colourful bleaching&quot;. As the zooxanthellae provide up to 90 percent of the coral&#x27;s energy needs through products of photosynthesis, after expelling, the coral may begin to starve.

Coral can survive short-term disturbances, but if the conditions that lead to the expulsion of the zooxanthellae persist, the coral&#x27;s chances of survival diminish. In order to recover from bleaching, the zooxanthellae have to re-enter the tissues of the coral polyps and restart photosynthesis to sustain the coral as a whole and the ecosystem that depends on it.
If the coral polyps die of starvation after bleaching, they will decay. The hard coral species will then leave behind their calcium carbonate skeletons, which will be taken over by algae, effectively blocking coral regrowth. Eventually, the coral skeletons will erode, causing the reef structure to collapse.

== Triggers ==
Coral bleaching may be caused by a number of factors. While localized triggers lead to localized bleaching, the large-scale coral bleaching events of recent years have been triggered by global warming. Under the increased carbon dioxide concentration expected in the 21st century, corals are expected to become increasingly rare on reef systems. Coral reefs located in warm, shallow water with low water flow have been more affected than reefs located in areas with higher water flow. Marine heatwaves caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation have been found to be one of the main causes of widespread coral bleaching and consequent coral mortality.

=== List of triggers ===
* increased water temperature (marine heatwaves, most commonly due to global warming), or reduced water temperatures
* increased solar irradiance (photosynthetically active radiation and ultraviolet light)
* increased sedimentation (due to silt runoff)
* bacterial infections
* changes in salinity
* herbicides
* extreme low tide and exposure
* cyanide fishing
* elevated sea levels due to global warming (Watson)
* mineral dust from African dust storms caused by drought
* pollutants such as oxybenzone, butylparaben, octyl methoxycinnamate, or enzacamene: four common sunscreen ingredients that are nonbiodegradable and can wash off of skin
* ocean acidification due to elevated levels of CO2 caused by air pollution
* being exposed to oil or other chemical spills
*changes in water chemistry, particularly an imbalance in the ratio of the macronutrients nitrate and phosphate
*meteorological conditions

== Trends due to climate change ==

Extreme bleaching events are directly linked with climate-induced phenomena that increase ocean temperature, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The warming ocean surface waters can lead to bleaching of corals which can cause serious damage and coral death. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 found that: &quot;Since the early 1980s, the frequency and severity of mass coral bleaching events have increased sharply worldwide&quot;. Coral reefs, as well as other shelf-sea ecosystems, such as rocky shores, kelp forests, seagrasses, and mangroves, have recently undergone mass mortalities from marine heatwaves. It is expected that many coral reefs will &quot;undergo irreversible phase shifts due to marine heatwaves with global warming levels &gt;1.5°C&quot;.

This problem was already identified in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the greatest threat to the world&#x27;s reef systems.

The Great Barrier Reef experienced its first major bleaching event in 1998. Since then, bleaching events have increased in frequency, with three events occurring in the years 2016–2020. Bleaching is predicted to occur three times a decade on the Great Barrier Reef if warming is kept to 1.5 °C, increasing every other year to 2 °C.

With the increase of coral bleaching events worldwide, &quot;National Geographic&quot; noted in 2017, &quot;In the past three years, 25 reefs—which comprise three-fourths of the world&#x27;s reef systems—experienced severe bleaching events in what scientists concluded was the worst-ever sequence of bleachings to date.&quot;

In a study conducted on the Hawaiian mushroom coral &quot;Lobactis scutaria&quot;, researchers discovered that higher temperatures and elevated levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) had a detrimental impact on its reproductive physiology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the survival of reef-building corals in their natural habitat, as coral reproduction is being hindered by the effects of climate change.

== Mass bleaching events ==
Elevated sea water temperatures are the main cause of mass bleaching events. Sixty major episodes of coral bleaching have occurred between 1979 and 1990, with the associated coral mortality affecting reefs in every part of the world. In 2016, the longest coral bleaching event was recorded. The longest and most destructive coral bleaching event was because of the El Niño that occurred from 2014 to 2017. During this time, over 70 percent of the coral reefs around the world have become damaged.

Factors that influence the outcome of a bleaching event include stress-resistance which reduces bleaching, tolerance to the absence of zooxanthellae, and how quickly new coral grows to replace the dead. Due to the patchy nature of bleaching, local climatic conditions such as shade or a stream of cooler water can reduce bleaching incidence. Coral and zooxanthellae health and genetics also influence bleaching.

Large coral colonies such as &quot;Porites&quot; are able to withstand extreme temperature shocks, while fragile branching corals such &quot;Acropora&quot; are far more susceptible to stress following a temperature change. Corals consistently exposed to low-stress levels may be more resistant to bleaching.

Scientists believe that the oldest known bleaching was that of the Late Devonian (Frasnian/Famennian), also triggered by the rise of sea surface temperatures. It resulted in the demise of the largest coral reefs in the Earth&#x27;s history.

According to Clive Wilkinson of Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network of Townsville, Australia, in 1998 the mass bleaching event that occurred in the Indian Ocean region was due to the rising of sea temperatures by 2 °C coupled with the strong El Niño event in 1997–1998.

In April 2024 a 4th global coral bleaching event was confirmed by NOAA The share of affected coral reefs worldwide by each of the four bleaching events has been estimated to be 20%, 35%, 56% and 54%.

Preceding this, the second major coral bleaching crisis of this decade began in February 2023, affecting reefs across 54 nations in all major ocean basins. This event has led to severe damage, with coral mortalities reaching up to 93% in areas like the Pacific coast near Mexico. The economic implications are profound, as coral reefs contribute approximately $2.7 trillion annually to the global economy, including $36 billion from tourism alone. Although a forthcoming shift to a La Niña phase may offer some relief, regions such as Florida have already experienced complete die-offs in some reefs, where temperatures have risen to 101°F (38.3°C). Moreover, the Great Barrier Reef is undergoing its fifth extensive bleaching event since 2016, underscoring the persistent and serious risks these vital ecosystems face.

== Impacts ==
Coral bleaching events and the subsequent loss of coral coverage often result in the decline of fish diversity. The loss of diversity and abundance in herbivorous fish particularly affect coral reef ecosystems. As mass bleaching events occur more frequently, fish populations will continue to homogenize. Smaller and more specialized fish species that fill particular ecological niches that are crucial for coral health are replaced by more generalized species. The loss of specialization likely contributes to the loss of resilience in coral reef ecosystems after bleaching events.

=== Economic and political impact ===
According to Brian Skoloff of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, &quot;If the reefs vanished, experts say, hunger, poverty and political instability could ensue.&quot; Since countless sea life depend on the reefs for shelter and protection from predators, the extinction of the reefs would ultimately create a domino effect that would trickle down to the many human societies that depend on those fish for food and livelihood. There has been a 44% decline in coral reefs over the last 20 years in the Florida Keys and up to 80% in the Caribbean alone.

Coral reefs provide various ecosystem services, one of which is being a natural fishery, as many frequently consumed commercial fish spawn or live out their juvenile lives in coral reefs around the tropics. Thus, reefs are a popular fishing site and are an important source of income for fishers, especially small, local fisheries. As coral reef habitat decreases due to bleaching, reef associated fish populations also decrease, which affects fishing opportunities. A model from one study by Speers et al. calculated direct losses to fisheries from decreased coral cover to be around $49–69 billion, if human societies continue to emit high levels of greenhouse gases. But, these losses could be reduced for a consumer surplus benefit of about $14–20 billion, if societies chose to emit a lower level of greenhouse gases instead. These economic losses also have important political implications, as they fall disproportionately on developing countries where the reefs are located, namely in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. It would cost more for countries in these areas to respond to coral reef loss as they would need to turn to different sources of income and food, in addition to losing other ecosystem services such as ecotourism. A study completed by Chen et al. suggested that the commercial value of reefs decreases by almost 4% every time coral cover decreases by 1% because of losses in ecotourism and other potential outdoor recreational activities.

Coral reefs also act as a protective barrier for coastlines by reducing wave impact, which lowers the damage from storms, erosions, and flooding. Countries that lose this natural protection will lose more money because of the increased susceptibility of storms. This indirect cost, combined with the lost revenue from tourism, will result in enormous economic effects.

=== Monitoring coral bleaching and reef sea surface temperature ===
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitors for bleaching &quot;hot spots&quot;, areas where sea surface temperature rises 1 °C or more above the long-term monthly average. The &quot;hot spots&quot; are the locations in which thermal stress is measured, and with the development of Degree Heating Week (DHW), the coral reef&#x27;s thermal stress is monitored. Global coral bleaching is being detected earlier due to the satellite remote sensing of the rise of sea temperatures. It is necessary to monitor the high temperatures because coral bleaching events are affecting coral reef reproduction and normal growth capacity, as well as it weakening corals, eventually leading to their mortality. This system detected the worldwide 1998 bleaching event, that corresponded to the 1997–98 El Niño event. Currently, 190 reef sites around the globe are monitored by the NOAA, and send alerts to research scientists and reef managers via the NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) website. By monitoring the warming of sea temperatures, the early warnings of coral bleaching alert reef managers to prepare for and draw awareness to future bleaching events. The first mass global bleaching events were recorded in 1998 and 2010, which was when the El Niño caused the ocean temperatures to rise and worsened the corals living conditions. The 2014–2017 El Niño was recorded to be the longest and most damaging to the corals, which harmed over 70% of our coral reefs. Over two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef have been reported to be bleached or dead.
To accurately monitoring the extent and evolution of bleaching events, scientist are using underwater photogrammetric techniques to create accurate orthophoto of coral reefs transects and AI-assisted image segmentation with open source tools like TagLab to identify from these photos the health status of the corals.

=== Changes in ocean chemistry ===
Increasing ocean acidification due to rises in carbon dioxide levels exacerbates the bleaching effects of thermal stress. Acidification affects the corals&#x27; ability to create calcareous skeletons, essential to their survival. This is because ocean acidification decreases the amount of carbonate ion in the water, making it more difficult for corals to absorb the calcium carbonate they need for the skeleton. As a result, the resilience of reefs goes down, while it becomes easier for them to erode and dissolve. In addition, the increase in CO2 allows herbivore overfishing and nutrification to change coral-dominated ecosystems to algal-dominated ecosystems. A recent study from the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that with the combination of acidification and temperature rises, the levels of CO2 could become too high for coral to survive in as little as 50 years.

=== Coral bleaching due to photoinhibition of zooxanthellae ===
Zooxanthellae are a type of dinoflagellate that live within the cytoplasm of many marine invertebrates. Members of the phylum Dinoflagellata, they are round microalgae that share a symbiotic relationship with their host. They are also part of the genus Symbiodinium and Kingdom Alveolata. These organisms are phytoplankton and therefore photosynthesize. The host organism harnesses the products of photosynthesis, i.e. oxygen, sugar, etc., and in exchange, the zooxanthellae are offered housing and protection, as well as carbon dioxide, phosphates, and other essential inorganic compounds that help them to survive and thrive. Zooxanthellae share 95% of the products of photosynthesis with their host coral. According to a study done by D.J. Smith et al., photoinhibition is a likely factor in coral bleaching. It also suggests that the hydrogen peroxide produced in zooxanthealle plays a role in signaling themselves to flee the corals. Photo-inhibition of Zooxanthellae can be caused by exposure to UV filters found in personal care products. In a study done by Zhong et al., Oxybenzone (BP-3) had the most negative effects on zooxanthellae health. The combination of temperature increase and presence of UV filters in the ocean has further decreased zooxanthellae health. The combination of UV filters and higher temperatures led to an additive effect on photo-inhibition and overall stress on coral species.

=== Infectious disease ===
Following bleaching events, there has been a rise in the global disease outbreak among coral populations. This is due to the weakened state of the corals that makes them susceptible to infection caused by disease-carrying pathogens. Infectious bacteria of the species &quot;Vibrio shiloi&quot; are the bleaching agent of &quot;Oculina patagonica&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea, causing this effect by attacking the zooxanthellae. &quot;V. shiloi&quot; is infectious only during warm periods. Elevated temperature increases the virulence of &quot;V. shiloi&quot;, which then become able to adhere to a beta-galactoside-containing receptor in the surface mucus of the host coral. &quot;V. shiloi&quot; then penetrates the coral&#x27;s epidermis, multiplies, and produces both heat-stable and heat-sensitive toxins, which affect zooxanthellae by inhibiting photosynthesis and causing lysis.

During the summer of 2003, coral reefs in the Mediterranean Sea appeared to gain resistance to the pathogen, and further infection was not observed. The main hypothesis for the emerged resistance is the presence of symbiotic communities of protective bacteria living in the corals. The bacterial species capable of lysing &quot;V. shiloi&quot; had not been identified as of 2011.

=== Pacific Ocean ===
==== Great Barrier Reef ====
The Great Barrier Reef along the coast of Australia experienced bleaching events in 1980, 1982, 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017, 2022 and 2024. Some locations suffered severe damage, with up to 90% mortality. The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals. An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.
A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans. These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef. The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas. In late November 2016, surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral. The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.
The IPCC&#x27;s moderate warming scenarios (B1 to A1T, 2 °C by 2100, IPCC, 2007, Table SPM.3, p. 13) forecast that corals on the Great Barrier Reef are very likely to regularly experience summer temperatures high enough to induce bleaching.

A study from early 2024 tracked 462 colonies of corals at One Tree Island after they were affected by heat stress. At the end of the study in July 2024 only 92 coral colonies were unaffected by bleaching, while 193 were dead and 113 were showing signs of bleaching.

==== Hawaii ====
In 1996, Hawaii&#x27;s first major coral bleaching occurred in Kaneohe Bay, followed by major bleaching events in the Northwest islands in 2002 and 2004. In 2014, biologists from the University of Queensland observed the first mass bleaching event, and attributed it to The Blob. In 2014 and 2015, a survey in Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve on Oahu found 47% of the corals suffering from coral bleaching and close to 10% of the corals dying. In 2014 and 2015, 56% of the coral reefs of the big island were affected by coral bleaching events. During the same period, 44% of the corals on west Maui were effected. On 24 January 2019, scientists with The Nature Conservancy found that the reefs had begun to stabilize nearly 4 years after the last bleaching event. According to the Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR), there was still a considerable amount of bleaching in 2019. On Oahu and Maui, up to 50% of the coral reefs were bleached. On the big island, roughly 40% of corals experienced bleaching in the Kona coast area. The DAR stated that the recent bleaching events have not been as bad as the 2014–2015 events. In 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released the first-ever nationwide coral reef status report. The report stated that the northwestern and main Hawaiian islands were in &quot;fair&quot; shape, meaning the corals have been moderately impacted.

* Hawaiian Sunscreen Policy In May 2018, Hawaii passed the bill &quot;SB-2571&quot;, banning the vending of sunscreen containing chemicals deemed conducive of coral bleaching on the island&#x27;s local reefs. The bill was signed in by David Ige, of the Democratic party.  A chemical deemed toxic in SB-2571 is the &#x27;oxybenzone&#x27; (also banned; octinoxate), a chemical that becomes toxic to coral when exposed to sunlight. Up to one-tenth of the approximated 14,000 tons of sunscreen polluting coral reef areas contains oxybenzone, putting almost half of all coral reefs in danger of being exposed. Coral reefs show increased rates of bleaching in both controlled and natural environments when exposed to high levels of oxybenzone, found in many commercial sunscreen products. Another study showed that over time, the presence of oxybenzone in water will decrease a reef&#x27;s strength to face other bleaching events such as increasing water temperatures. SB-2571 banned all sunscreen products with the exception of prescription products. Hawaii is the first U.S. state to introduce this type of ban, which went into effect in January 2021.

==== Jarvis Island ====
Eight severe and two moderate bleaching events occurred between 1960 and 2016 in the coral community in Jarvis Island, with the 2015–16 bleaching displaying the unprecedented severity in the record.

==== Japan ====
About 94% of the corals on Japan&#x27;s Iriomote Island in the Ryukyu Islands bleached during a significant coral bleaching event that occurred in 2016. Prior to this event, the region typically experienced multiple typhoons during July and August. However, during this particular event, no typhoon was detected until September, suggesting a prolonged period of high seawater temperatures. According to the 2017 Japanese government report, almost 75% of Japan&#x27;s largest coral reef in Okinawa has died from bleaching.

In summer of 2024, rising sea temperatures were responsible for a major bleaching event that killed 61.2% of corals off Amami-Oshima island, Japan. The bleaching was brought on by sea temperatures 2° higher than in 2023.

=== Indian Ocean ===
Coral reef provinces have been permanently damaged by warm sea temperatures, most severely in the Indian Ocean. Up to 90% of coral cover has been lost in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Tanzania and in the Seychelles during the massive 1997–98 bleaching event. The Indian Ocean in 1998 reported 20% of its coral had died and 80% was bleached. The shallow tropical areas of the Indian Ocean are already experiencing what are predicted to be worldwide ocean conditions in the future. Coral that has survived in the shallow areas of the Indian Ocean may be proper candidates for coral restoration efforts in other areas of the world because they are able to survive the extreme conditions of the ocean.

==== Maldives ====
The Maldives has over 20,000 km2 of reefs, of which more than 60% of the coral has suffered from bleaching in 2016. Moreover, the Maldivian coral reef faces risks from the growing tourism industry and coastal construction, as well as land reclamation projects, alongside natural challenges such as diseases.

==== Thailand ====
Coral reef ecosystems are a notable feature of the western shoreline of the Gulf of Thailand. In 1998 and 2010, there were bleaching events in Thailand; the effects of both occurrences varied among coral species, with some exhibiting more resilience to the 2010 bleaching. In contrast to 1998, there was a more severe bleaching event in 2010. Thailand experienced a severe mass bleaching in 2010 which affected 70% of the coral in the Andaman Sea. Between 30% and 95% of the bleached coral died.

==== Indonesia ====
&quot;Acropora&quot; corals were dominant coral species of Indonesian reef system however they are extremely vulnerable to external stressors. A study was conducted to study effect of mass bleaching event in 2010 on &quot;Acropora&quot;. Post bleaching recovery is influenced by severity and frequency of the bleaching event. Research indicates that frequent moderate disturbances tend to affect &quot;Porites&quot;, while less frequent but stronger disturbances primarily impact &quot;Acropora&quot;. Consequently, &quot;Acropora&quot; demonstrates rapid regrowth in such instances.

In 2017, there was a study done on two islands in Indonesia to see how their coral cover was. One of the places was the Melinjo Islands and the other was the Saktu Islands. On Saktu Island, the lifeform conditions were categorized as bad, with an average coral cover of 22.3%. In the Melinjo Islands, the lifeform conditions were categorized as bad, with an average coral cover of 22.2%.

=== Atlantic Ocean ===
==== United States ====
During the 2005 mass bleaching event in Florida, the bleaching patterns varied among species. &quot;Colpophyllia natans&quot; and &quot;Diploria strigosa&quot; were particularly susceptible to thermal stress, whereas &quot;Stephanocoenia intersepta&quot; exhibited greater tolerance. Moreover, it was noted that larger coral colonies experienced more bleaching compared to smaller ones. The prediction suggests that mass bleaching events are likely to affect larger coral colonies even within the same community.

In South Florida, a 2016 survey of large corals from Key Biscayne to Fort Lauderdale found that about 66% of the corals were dead or reduced to less than half of their live tissue.

==== Belize ====
The first recorded mass bleaching event that took place in the Belize Barrier Reef was in 1998, where sea level temperatures reached up to from 10 August to 14 October. For a few days, Hurricane Mitch brought in stormy weather on 27 October but only reduced temperatures by 1 degree or less. During this time period, mass bleaching in the fore-reef and lagoon occurred. While some fore reef colonies suffered some damage, coral mortality in the lagoon was catastrophic.

The most prevalent coral in the reefs Belize in 1998 was the lettuce coral, &quot;Agaricia tenuifolia&quot;. On 22 and 23 October, surveys were conducted at two sites and the findings were devastating. Virtually all the living coral was bleached white and their skeletons indicated that they had died recently. At the lagoon floor, complete bleaching was evident among &quot;A. tenuifolia&quot;. Furthermore, surveys done in 1999 and 2000 showed a near total mortality of &quot;A. tenuifolia&quot; at all depths. Similar patterns occurred in other coral species as well. Measurements on water turbidity suggest that these mortalities were attributed to rising water temperatures rather than solar radiation.

==== Caribbean ====
Hard coral cover on reefs in the Caribbean have declined by an estimated 80%, from an average of 50% cover in the 1970s to only about 10% cover in the early 2000s. A 2013 study to follow up on a mass bleaching event in Tobago from 2010 showed that after only one year, the majority of the dominant species declined by about 62% while coral abundance declined by about 50%. However, between 2011 and 2013, coral cover increased for 10 of the 26 dominant species but declined for 5 other populations.

=== Other areas ===
Coral in the south Red Sea does not bleach despite summer water temperatures up to .
Coral bleaching in the Red Sea is more common in the northern section of the reefs; the southern part of the reef has been plagued by coral-eating starfish, dynamite fishing and human impacts on the environment. In 1988, there was a massive bleaching event that affected the reefs in Saudi Arabia and Sudan, though the southern reefs were more resilient and it affected them very little. Previously, it was thought that the northern reef suffers more from coral bleaching and shows a fast turnover of coral, while the southern reef was thought to not suffer from bleaching as harshly and show more consistency. However, new research shows that where the southern reef should be bigger and healthier than the northern, it was not. This is believed to be because of major disturbances in recent history from bleaching events, and coral-eating starfish.
In 2010, coral bleaching occurred in Saudi Arabia and Sudan, where the temperature rose 10 to 11 degrees. Certain taxa experienced 80% to 100% of their colonies bleaching, while some showed on average 20% of that taxa bleaching.

== Coral adaptation ==

In recent times, climate change has been linked to a notable increase in coral mortality. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that bacteria associated with corals contribute to their ability to withstand thermal stress. Attempts have been undertaken to enhance coral resilience in the face of bleaching incidents. Since corals serve as the fundamental components of coral reefs, their decline significantly affects the endurance and composition of reefs directly affecting the reef-dwelling organisms. 

In 2010, researchers at Penn State discovered corals that were thriving while using an unusual species of symbiotic algae in the warm waters of the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. Normal zooxanthellae cannot withstand temperatures as high as was there, so this finding was unexpected. This gives researchers hope that with rising temperatures due to global warming, coral reefs will develop tolerance for different species of symbiotic algae that are resistant to high temperature, and can live within the reefs.
In 2010, researchers from Stanford University also found corals around the Samoan Islands that experience a drastic temperature increase for about four hours a day during low tide. The corals do not bleach or die regardless of the high heat increase. Studies showed that the corals off the coast of Ofu Island near America Samoa have become trained to withstand the high temperatures. Researchers are now asking a new question: can we condition corals, that are not from this area, in this manner and slowly introduce them to higher temperatures for short periods of time and make them more resilient against rising ocean temperatures.

Certain mild bleaching events can cause coral to produce high concentrations of sun-screening pigments in order to shield themselves from further stress. Some of the pigments produced have pink, blue or purple hues, while others are strongly fluorescent. Production of these pigments by shallow-water corals is stimulated by blue light. When corals bleach, blue light inside the coral tissue increases greatly because it is no longer being absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments found inside the symbiotic algae, and is instead reflected by the white coral skeleton. This causes an increase in the production of the sun-screening pigments, making the bleached corals appear very colourful instead of white – a phenomenon sometimes called &#x27;colourful coral bleaching&#x27;.

Increased sea surface temperature leads to the thinning of the epidermis and apoptosis of gastrodermis cells in the host coral. The reduction in apoptosis and gastrodermis is seen via epithelium, leading to up to a 50% loss in the concentration of symbionts over a short period of time. Under conditions of high temperature or increased light exposure, the coral will exhibit a stress response that includes producing reactive oxygen species, the accumulation of this if not removed by antioxidant systems will lead to the death of the coral. Studies testing the structures of coral under heat stressed environments show that the thickness of the coral itself greatly decreases under heat stress compared to the control. With the death of the zooxanthellae in the heat stressed events, the coral must find new sources to gather fixed carbon to generate energy, species of coral that can increase their carnivorous tendencies have been found to have an increased likelihood of recovering from bleaching events.

After the zooxanthellae leaves the coral, the coral structures are often taken over by algae due to their ability to outcompete the zooxanthella since they need less resources to survive. There is little evidence of competition between zooxanthellae and algae, but in the absence of zooxanthellae the algae thrives on the coral structures. Once algae takes over and the coral can no longer sustain itself, the structures often begin to decay due to ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is the process by which carbon dioxide is absorbed into the ocean, this decreases the amounts of carbonate ions in the ocean, a necessary ion corals use to build their skeletons. Corals go through processes of decalcifying and calcifying during different times of the day and year due to temperature fluctuations. Under current IPCC emission pathway scenarios, corals tend to disintegrate, and the winter months with cooler temperatures will not serve ample time for the corals to reform.

=== Artificial assistance ===
In 2020, scientists reported to have evolved 10 clonal strains of a common coral microalgal endosymbionts at elevated temperatures for 4 years, increasing their thermal tolerance for climate resilience. Three of the strains increased the corals&#x27; bleaching tolerance after reintroduction into coral host larvae. Their strains and findings may potentially be relevant for the adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and further tests of algal strains in adult colonies across a range of coral species are planned.

In 2021, researchers demonstrated that probiotics can help coral reefs mitigate heat stress, indicating that such could make them more resilient to climate change and mitigate coral bleaching.

== Recovery and macroalgal regime shifts ==
After corals experience a bleaching event to increased temperature stress some reefs are able to return to their original, pre-bleaching state. Reefs either recover from bleaching, where they are recolonized by zooxanthellae, or they experience a regime shift, where previously flourishing coral reefs are taken over by thick layers of macroalgae. This inhibits further coral growth because the algae produces antifouling compounds to deter settlement and competes with corals for space and light. As a result, macroalgae forms stable communities that make it difficult for corals to grow again. Reefs will then be more susceptible to other issues, such as declining water quality and removal of herbivore fish, because coral growth is weaker. Discovering what causes reefs to be resilient or recover from bleaching events is of primary importance because it helps inform conservation efforts and protect coral more effectively.

A primary subject of research regarding coral recovery pertains to the idea of super-corals, otherwise referred to as the corals that live and thrive in naturally warmer and more acidic regions and bodies of water. When transplanted to endangered or bleached reefs, their resilience and irradiance can equip the algae to live among the bleached corals. As Emma Camp, a National Geographic Explorer, marine bio-geochemist and an ambassador for Biodiversity for the charity IBEX Earth, suggests, the super-corals could have the capability to help with the damaged reefs long-term. While it can take 10 to 15 years to restore damaged and bleached coral reefs, the super-corals could have lasting impacts despite climate change as the oceans rise in temperature and gain more acidity. Bolstered by the research of Ruth Gates, Camp has looked into lower oxygen levels and the extreme, unexpected habitats that reefs can be found in across the globe.

Corals have shown to be resilient to short-term disturbances. Recovery has been shown in after storm disturbance and crown of thorns starfish invasions. Fish species tend to fare better following reef disturbance than coral species as corals show limited recovery and reef fish assemblages have shown little change as a result of short-term disturbances. In contrast, fish assemblages in reefs that experience bleaching exhibit potentially damaging changes. One study by Bellwood &quot;et al&quot;. notes that while species richness, diversity, and abundance did not change, fish assemblages contained more generalist species and less coral dependent species. Responses to coral bleaching are diverse between reef fish species, based on what resources are affected. Rising sea temperature and coral bleaching do not directly impact adult fish mortality, but there are many indirect consequences of both. Coral-associated fish populations tend to be in decline due to habitat loss; however, some herbivorous fish populations have seen a drastic increase due to the increase of algae colonization on dead coral. Studies note that better methods are needed to measure the effects of disturbance on the resilience of corals.

Until recently, the factors mediating the recovery of coral reefs from bleaching were not well studied. Research by Graham &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) studied 21 reefs around Seychelles in the Indo-Pacific in order to document the long-term effects of coral bleaching. After the loss of more than 90% of corals due to bleaching in 1998 around 50% of the reefs recovered and roughly 40% of the reefs experienced regime shifts to macroalgae dominated compositions. After an assessment of factors influencing the probability of recovery, the study identified five major factors: density of juvenile corals, initial structural complexity, water depth, biomass of herbivorous fishes, and nutrient conditions on the reef. Overall, resilience was seen most in coral reef systems that were structurally complex and in deeper water.

The ecological roles and functional groups of species also play a role in the recovery of regime shifting potential in reef systems. Coral reefs are affected by bioeroding, scraping, and grazing fish species. Bioeroding species remove dead corals, scraping species remove algae and sediment to further future growth, grazing species remove algae. The presence of each type of species can influence the ability for normal levels of coral recruitment which is an important part of coral recovery. Lowered numbers of grazing species after coral bleaching in the Caribbean has been likened to sea-urchin-dominated systems which do not undergo regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae dominated conditions.

There is always the possibility of unobservable changes, or cryptic losses or resilience, in a coral community&#x27;s ability to perform ecological processes. These cryptic losses can result in unforeseen regime changes or ecological flips. More detailed methods for determining the health of coral reefs that take into account long-term changes to the coral ecosystems and better-informed conservation policies are necessary to protect coral reefs in the years to come.

== Rebuilding coral reefs ==
Research is being done to help slow down the mortality rate of corals. Worldwide projects are being completed to help replenish and restore the coral reefs. Current coral restoration efforts include microfragmentation, coral farming, and relocation. The population of corals is rapidly declining, so scientists are doing experiments in coral growth and research tanks to help replenish their population. These research tanks mimic the coral reefs natural environment in the ocean. They are growing corals in these tanks to use for their experiments, so no more corals are being harmed or taken from the ocean. They are also transplanting the successfully grown corals from the research tanks and putting them into the areas of the ocean where the reefs are dying out. An experiment is being done in some coral growth and research tanks by Ruth Gates and Madelaine Van Oppen. They are trying to make &quot;super corals&quot; that can withstand some of the environmental factors that the corals are currently dying from. Van Oppen is also working on developing a type of algae that will have a symbiotic relationship with corals and can withstand water temperature fluctuations for long periods of time. This project may be helping to replenish our reefs, but the growing process of corals in research tanks is very time-consuming. It can take at least 10 years for the corals to fully grow and mature enough to where they will be able to breed. Following Ruth Gates&#x27; death in October 2018, her team at the Gates Coral Lab at the Hawai&#x27;i Institute of Marine Biology continues her research on restoration efforts. Continuing research and restoration efforts at the Gates Coral Lab focuses on the effects of beneficial mutations, genetic variation, and relocation via human assistance on the resilience of coral reefs. As of 2019, the Gates Coral Lab team determined that large-scale restoration techniques would not be effective; localized efforts to restore coral reefs on an individual basis are tested to be more realistic and effective while research is conducted to determine the best ways to combat coral destruction on a mass scale.

=== Marine Protected Areas ===

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are sectioned-off areas of the ocean designated for protection from human activities such as fishing and un-managed tourism. According to NOAA, MPAs currently occupy 26% of U.S. waters. MPAs have been documented to improve and prevent the effects of coral bleaching in the United States. In 2018, research by coral scientists in the Caribbean concluded that areas of the ocean managed/protected by government had improved conditions that coral reefs were able to flourish in. MPAs defend ecosystems from overfishing, which allows multiple species of fish to thrive and deplete seaweed density, making it easier for young coral organisms to grow and increase in population/strength. From this study, a 62% increase in coral populations was recorded due to the protection of an MPA. Higher populations of young coral increase the longevity of a reef, as well as its ability to recover from extreme bleaching events.

=== Local impacts and solutions to coral bleaching ===
There are a number of stressors locally impacting coral bleaching, including sedimentation, continual support of urban development, land change, increased tourism, untreated sewage, and pollution. To illustrate, increased tourism is good for a country, however, it also comes with costs. An example is the Dominican Republic which relies heavily on its coral reefs to attract tourists resulting in increased structural damage, over fishing, nutrient pollution, and an increase in diseases to the coral reefs. As a result, the Dominican Republic has implemented a sustainable management plan for its land and marine areas to regulate ecotourism.

== Economic value of coral reefs ==
Coral reefs provide shelter to an estimated quarter of all ocean species. Experts estimate that coral reef services are worth up to $1.2 million per hectare which translates to an average of $172 billion per year. The benefits of coral reefs include providing physical structures such as coastal shoreline protection, biotic services within and between ecosystems, biogeochemical services such as maintaining nitrogen levels in the ocean, climate records, and recreational and commercial (tourism) services. Coral reefs are one of the best marine ecosystems to use to as a food source. The coral reefs are also the perfect habitat for rare and economically important species of tropical fish, as they provide the perfect area for fish to breed and create nurseries in. If the populations of the fish and corals in the reef are high, then we can use the area as a place to gather food and things with medicinal properties, creating jobs for people who can collect these specimens. The reefs also have cultural importance in specific regions around the world.

== Cost benefit analysis of reducing loss of coral reefs ==
Coral restoration is a common strategy used to combat the problems brought on by global warming; however, while ecological factors are primarily taken into account, efforts need also be made to address social, economic, and governance factors. The rapid growth in advocacy and implementation of intervention measures, such coral restoration, are a result of the intensifying effects of climate change and human pressure on coral reefs. The goal is to preserve the remaining reefs and the functions that they provide to the reef ecosystem.

The Paris Agreement has offered reasons for hope by pledging nations worldwide to maintain the rise in global average temperatures significantly below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, with concerted endeavors aimed at capping the increase at 1.5°C. In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x27;s (CBD) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 created twenty distinct targets for sustainable development for post-2015. Target 10 indicates the goal of minimizing &quot;anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs&quot;. Two programs were looked at, one that reduces coral reef loss by 50% that has a capital cost of $684 million and a recurrent cost of $81 million. The other program reduces coral reef loss by 80 percent and has a capital cost of $1.036 billion with recurring costs of $130 million. CBD acknowledges that they may be underestimating the costs and resources needed to achieve this target due to lack of relevant data but nonetheless, the cost–benefit analysis shows that the benefits outweigh the costs by a great enough amount for both programs (benefit cost ratio of 95.3 and 98.5) that &quot;there is ample scope to increase outlays on coral protection and still achieve a benefit to cost ratio that is well over one&quot;.

<doc id="399920" wikidata="Q1016925" url="?curid=399920" title="Galashiels">
<text>Galashiels (; , ) is a town in the Scottish Borders with a population of around 12,600. Its name is often colloquially shortened to &quot;Gala&quot;. The town is a major commercial centre for the Borders region with extensive history in the textile industry. Galashiels is the location of Heriot-Watt University&#x27;s School of Textiles and Design.

==History==

To the west of the town, there is an ancient earthwork known as the Picts&#x27; Work Ditch or Catrail. It extends many miles south, and its height and width vary. There is no agreement about the purpose of the earthwork. There is another ancient site on the north-western edge of the town, at Torwoodlee, an Iron Age hill fort, with a later broch known as Torwoodlee Broch built in the western quarter of the hill fort, and overlapping some of the defensive ditches of the original fort. The Romans destroyed the broch in 140 CE, soon after it was completed.

The town&#x27;s coat of arms shows two foxes reaching up to eat plums from a tree, and the motto is &quot;Sour Plums&quot; pronounced in Scots as soor plooms. This is a reference to an incident in 1337 when a raiding party of English soldiers were picking wild plums close to the town and were caught by Scots who came across them by chance and slaughtered them all.

On a hillside to the north of the town, Buckholm Tower is a prominent structure that dates back to 1582 and replaced an earlier tower built on the same site but destroyed around 1570. In 1599, Galashiels received its Burgh Charter, an event celebrated every summer since the 1930s, by the &quot;Braw Lads’ Gathering&quot;, with riders on horseback parading through the town. Galashiels Burgh Chambers were designed in the Scottish Renaissance style and completed in 1867. 

The Paton Street drill hall was completed in the late 19th century. The textile trade caused Galashiels&#x27; population to increase dramatically from 800 residents at the start of the nineteenth century to 19,553 by 1890. A connection with the town&#x27;s mill history, the Mill Lade, still links the town from near the site of mills at Wheatlands Road, to Netherdale, via Wilderhaugh, Bank Street, the Fountain and next to the Tesco/retail development Street.

Despite the town&#x27;s relatively low population, the early 2000s saw many new developments, including Asda, Boots pharmacy, Halfords, Marks &amp; Spencer, Matalan, McDonald&#x27;s, Next, Subway fast-food outlet and Tesco Extra. Most of these are on former mill and industrial estate sites, while other disused mills have been converted to living accommodations.

==Governance==
Local government services for Galashiels are provided by the Scottish Borders Council. There is also a community council covering the town. Galashiels was designated a burgh of barony in 1599 and later became a police burgh by 1868. Galashiels Burgh Chambers on Albert Place was built in 1867. 

When elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, burghs which met certain criteria were excluded from the area under the control of the county councils. There was disagreement between Galashiels and Selkirkshire County Council as to whether these criteria applied to Galashiels. The case went to court, and the Scottish Supreme Court found that Galashiels was entirely responsible for its own affairs and should neither be represented on nor taxed by Selkirkshire County Council. Further local government reform in 1930 brought the burgh of Galashiels within the area controlled by the county council, with the town being reclassified as a small burgh, ceding most of its functions to the county council.

In 1975, local government across Scotland was reformed under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The burghs and counties were abolished as administrative areas and replaced with a two-tier system of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Galashiels therefore became part of the Ettrick and Lauderdale district within the Borders region. Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council used Galashiels Burgh Chambers as its headquarters. Further local government reform in 1996 abolished the regions and districts, since when Galashiels has been administered by Scottish Borders Council.

==Culture==
===The arts===

Robert Burns wrote two poems about Galashiels, &quot;Sae Fair Her Hair&quot; and &quot;Braw Lads&quot;. The latter is sung by some of the townsfolk each year at the Braw Lads Gathering. Sir Walter Scott built his home, Abbotsford, just across the River Tweed from Galashiels. The Sir Walter Scott Way, a long-distance path from Moffat to Cockburnspath, passes through Galashiels. There is some largely good-hearted rivalry between some of the Galashiels townsfolk and those of other border towns, particularly Hawick, the next largest town in the Scottish Borders. Galashiels&#x27; citizens often refer to their rival as &quot;dirty Hawick&quot; while the &#x27;Teries&#x27; retort that Galashiels&#x27;s residents are &quot;pail merks&quot;, supposedly because their town was the last to be plumbed into the mains water system and so residents had to rely on buckets as toilets. 

Galashiels was also home to the author of the famous Scottish song &quot;Coulters Candy&quot;. Robert Coltart was a weaver in the town, but also made confectionery in nearby Melrose. The song was created as an advertisement and hence was renamed &quot;Sugar Candy&quot; when played by the BBC. The song is possibly better known by the first line of its chorus - &quot;Ally, bally, ally bally bee&quot;. Coltart died in 1890. A statue of Coltart now stands in the Market Square. The 1985 Marillion hit single &quot;Kayleigh&quot; was partially inspired by events that took place in Galashiels as the band&#x27;s lead singer, Fish, spent some time in the town in his earlier years. In 2012, the Scottish Borders Council undertook work to revamp the Market Square with lyrics of the song inscribed into the paving slabs. Fish officially reopened the square on completion later that year.

A new £6.7m Great Tapestry of Scotland Centre opened in Galashiels on 21 August 2021, to house one of the world’s largest tapestries and community arts projects. The Great Tapestry of Scotland was hand stitched by over 1,000 people across Scotland and had been taken for display around the country throughout its six-years&#x27; creation, the original brainchild of Edinburgh-born author Alexander McCall Smith, whose vision it was to create a tapestry telling the history of Scotland. The new purpose-built gallery, visitor centre, café and workshop space has been created and, on the opening day, saw the 160th and final tapestry panel revealed by chief stitcher Dorie Wilkie, accompanied by McCall Smith himself.

The Pavilion Cinema in Market Street opened in 1922 as a cinema, dance hall and theatre, originally named the Playhouse. The auditorium was converted to a bingo hall in the 1960s. The building was refurbished in the early 1990s, with its original art-deco façade being restored. It is now a four-screen cinema.

The town is home to the Glasite church, in danger of being lost, but still standing sandwiched between mills and shop buildings on High Street, Botany Lane and Roxburgh Street.

Netherdale is home to Gala RFC and Gala Fairydean Rovers, with the football and rugby stadiums adjoining each other at one end. The football club&#x27;s main stand was built in 1963 to designs by Peter Womersley, based in nearby Gattonside. The cantilevered concrete structure, in the Brutalist style, is now protected as a Category A listed building.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 93.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Scottish Borders and North Northumberland on 96.8 FM and TD1 Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast on 106.5 FM. 

The Border Telegraph and Southern Reporter are the town&#x27;s local newspapers. 

==Transport==
In 1969, the historic Waverley Line, which connected the Scottish Borders to the national rail network, was closed as part of a wider series of cuts to British Railways. The closure led to a campaign for a return of rail to the region that never diminished. Following years of campaigning, in 2006, the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament, which authorised a partial restoration of the service. The new Borders Railway, which links Galashiels with Edinburgh, saw four new stations built in Midlothian and three in the Scottish Borders.

For most of the route, the original line was followed with of new railway line built. The project is estimated to have cost £294 million and was completed in September 2015, with the formal opening on 9 September by the Queen. Trains from Galashiels railway station run every half-hour going down to hourly in the evening and on Sundays. Journey times between Tweedbank and Edinburgh take less than one hour.

The town also has a recently-opened Interchange building which replaces the old bus station and is also situated next to the railway station. It has a café, and upstairs has office space that has been leased to businesses and organizations. It also has toilet and baby-changing facilities, and a travel helpdesk.

==Climate==
Galashiels has an oceanic climate. However, due to its elevated position and distance from the sea, it has colder winters and slightly warmer summers than coastal places such as Edinburgh, Dunbar and Eyemouth. Snow is also much more common in winter, and covers the ground for an average of 38 days a year in an average winter.

<doc id="399927" wikidata="Q1452908" url="?curid=399927" title="Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol">
<text>Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, (1 August 1730 – 8 July 1803), was an 18th-century Anglican prelate.

Elected Bishop of Cloyne in 1767 and translated to the see of Derry in 1768, Hervey served as Bishop of Derry until his death in 1803.

He is remembered for designing mansions at Downhill and Ballyscullion, and he was known as the Edifying Bishop or the Earl-Bishop (in allusion to prince-bishop).

== Early life ==
Frederick Hervey was born in Suffolk, and attended Westminster School before going up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he read Law. He took an MA degree in 1754 and was later awarded a DD (Cantab) in 1770.

==Titles==
Accorded the courtesy style The Honourable after his father&#x27;s death in 1743, both of his brothers died without an heir. Thus he succeeded his immediate elder brother, Admiral Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol, in the title in December 1779, becoming the 4th earl. He also inherited the Hervey family&#x27;s extensive ancestral estates centred on Ickworth House in Suffolk.

Hervey conceived the redevelopment of the Ickworth estate to a standard appropriate to his family&#x27;s wealth, with the added practical purpose of housing his extensive art collection. Work started in 1794, but so ambitious was the project that by the time of his death in 1803 only the Rotunda had been constructed. However, his son Frederick (later Marquess of Bristol) took over and completed his father&#x27;s vision for Ickworth House, eventually completing the wings and its gardens in 1830.
In 1799 the Howard de Walden barony by writ was called out of abeyance by the House of Lords Committee of Privileges in the 4th Earl of Bristol&#x27;s favour. Thus he succeeded as 5th Baron Howard de Walden, a title which devolved upon him via his grandmother (Elizabeth, Countess of Bristol, the 1st earl&#x27;s 2nd wife), who was daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Felton and great-great-granddaughter of Sir Thomas Howard, KG (created a baron 1597).

Styled Bishop Hervey after his consecration on 31 May 1767, the following year he was translated as Lord Bishop of Derry, which became his formal ecclesiastical style until his death in 1803.

==Church career==
Hervey was ordained in 1754 as a Fellow of Corpus Christi College and then became Clerk of the Privy Seal in 1756 and Principal Clerk in 1761 before appointment as a Royal chaplain in 1763.

Hervey then set off on an extended Grand Tour while awaiting ecclesiastical preferment. During his European travels, he developed his already insatiable passion for art.

His eldest brother, George, 2nd Earl of Bristol, became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1766 and helped to secure his election as Bishop of Cloyne in 1767. Hervey displayed great enthusiasm for improving the property of the see of Cloyne which opened the way for his translation to the well endowed bishopric of Derry a year later. As Bishop of Derry, Hervey quickly developed a reputation for being &quot;the most worldly, most eccentric, most talked-about priest in the Church of Ireland&quot;.

Hervey was Derry&#x27;s most generous philanthropist, although some of the clergy in his diocese came to regard him as cheerfully sadistic, for such instances as when he instructed any portly priests coveting plum promotions to compete in midnight runs through bogs and marshland.

Given his family&#x27;s wealth, Hervey both enjoyed personal luxury and expended large sums on building roads and developing agricultural enterprise within his diocese, including within the City of Derry.

Hervey was especially keen on architectural design and built mansions at Downhill and Ballyscullion; he then filled them with works of art from Italy and elsewhere.

==Political activity==

Hervey favoured absolute religious equality, and opposed the feudal system of tithes. Having again passed some time in Italy, he returned to Ireland and in 1782 threw himself ardently into the Irish Volunteer Movement, quickly attaining a prominent position among the volunteers. With much pomp, he arrived at an Irish nationalist convention held at Dublin in November 1783. Buoyed by his status and popularity Bishop Hervey let slip some scurrilous talk of rebellion which led the Dublin Castle administration to contemplate his arrest.

After this Hervey took no further part in British politics, spending his later years mainly on the continent of Europe. In 1798 he was imprisoned by the French at Milan for suspected espionage and was held in custody for eighteen months.

Upon his release, Hervey headed for Rome. En route at Albano, he needed overnight accommodation, which was offered by an Italian peasant by way of an outhouse; he and his wife were opposed to welcoming a Protestant into their house. The Lord Bishop died there outdoors at Albano. The earl&#x27;s body was repatriated to England before being buried at Ickworth.

Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1782, the following year Hervey received the Freedom of the City of Dublin as well as of Derry.

== Personality==
Varying estimates have been found of his character. He was considered clever and cultured, but licentious and eccentric. He was a great collector of art and in later life, he openly professed materialistic opinions. Hervey fell in love with Wilhelmina, Countess von Lichtenau, King Frederick William II of Prussia&#x27;s mistress, and by his bearing and often unusual and ostentatious style of dress he gave fresh point to Voltaire&#x27;s original saying: &quot;when God created the human race, he made men, women and Herveys&quot;.

During his European travels, and especially during his frequent visits to Rome, Hervey was known to walk around wearing a broad-brimmed white hat, many gold chains and red breeches, in what was perceived as a possible attempt to upstage his Catholic rivals.

As a bishop, Hervey was industrious and vigilant (despite his long absences from Ireland) albeit having once declared himself an agnostic. King George III, bemused by his behaviour, began referring to Bishop Hervey as &quot;that wicked prelate&quot;!

It is said that Hervey&#x27;s knowledge of fine things in Europe and love of travelling and staying in luxury inspired the fashion for naming a hotel the Hotel Bristol. The use of this name is meant to be synonymous with the finest accommodation and living throughout the Continent; the implication being that if Hervey were in town, that is where he would stay.

==Family==
The Hon. Frederick Hervey married, in 1752, Elizabeth Davers (1733–1800), daughter of Sir Jermyn Davers, a great-granddaughter of Thomas, 2nd Baron Jermyn, as well as being sister and heiress of Sir Charles Davers (1737–1807).

By their marriage, Hervey had four sons and three daughters:
* Lady Mary Caroline Hervey (1753–1842); married John Crichton, 1st Earl Erne, the couple later separated.
* George (1755–1765); died of illness aged nine, at Spa, Belgium, while the family was travelling.
* John &quot;Jack&quot; Augustus Hervey, Lord Hervey (1757–1796); Captain RN, married Elizabeth Drummond and predeceased his father, leaving issue one daughter (&quot;qv&quot;. Baron Seaford)
* Lady Elizabeth Christiana Hervey (1758–1824); married firstly John Thomas Foster, an Irish politician; after separation from her first husband became longtime mistress and later second wife of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. 
* Short-lived son (b. and d. 1761)
* Lady Louisa Theodosia Hervey (1767–1821); married Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool and Prime Minister, 1812–1827.
* Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol (1769–1859); styled by courtesy Lord Hervey after 1796.

In 1782, after 30 years of marriage, Hervey and his wife separated. The two never saw each other again, although Hervey regularly corresponded with his children, including the youngest daughter Louisa, who lived with her mother.

When Hervey died in 1803 in Lazio, Italy, his son Frederick succeeded as 5th Earl of Bristol as well as to the family estates including Ickworth House. The title of Baron Howard de Walden however passed to his great-grandson Charles Ellis, son of the 1st Baron Seaford, son of The Hon. Elizabeth Hervey (only child of Jack, Lord Hervey).

<doc id="399928" wikidata="Q458004" url="?curid=399928" title="James Edward Smith (botanist)">
<text>Sir James Edward Smith (2 December 1759 – 17 March 1828) was an English botanist and founder of the Linnean Society.

== Early life and education ==

Smith was born in Norwich in 1759, the son of a wealthy wool merchant. He started studying botanical science when he was eighteen. In 1781 he enrolled in the medical course at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied chemistry under Joseph Black, natural history under John Walker, and botany under John Hope, an early teacher of Linnaean taxonomy. He moved to London in 1783 to continue his studies and became a friend of Sir Joseph Banks, who was offered the entire collection of books, manuscripts and specimens of the Swedish natural historian and botanist Carl Linnaeus following the death of his son Carolus Linnaeus the Younger. Banks declined the purchase, but Smith borrowed money from his father and bought the collection for the price of £1,000 in 1784. Smith was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1785.

== Academic career ==
Between 1786 and 1788, Smith made the grand tour through the Netherlands, France, Italy and Switzerland visiting botanists, picture galleries and herbaria. He founded the Linnean Society of London in 1788, becoming its first President, a post he held until his death. He returned to live in Norwich in 1796 bringing with him the entire Linnean Collection. His library and botanical collections acquired European fame and was visited by numerous entomologists and botanists from all over the Continent. In 1792, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 

In 1796, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Smith spent the remaining thirty years of his life writing books and articles on botany. His books included &quot;Flora Britannica&quot; and &quot;The English Flora&quot; (4 volumes, 1824–1828). He contributed 3,348 botanical articles to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; between 1808 and 1819, following the death of Rev. William Wood, who had started the work. In addition, he contributed 57 biographies of botanists. 

He contributed seven volumes to the major botanical publication of the eighteenth century, &quot;Flora Graeca&quot;, the publications begun by John Sibthorp. A fruitful collaboration was found through descriptions Smith supplied to publisher and illustrator, James Sowerby with whom he subsequently developed as passionate interest in mosses and lichens. Depiction of flora in England had previously only found patronage for aesthetic concerns, but an interest in gardening and natural history saw illustrated publications, such as the exotic &quot;A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland&quot; and James Sowerby&#x27;s 36-volume &quot;English Botany&quot;, reach new audiences.

In 1797, Smith published &quot;The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia&quot;, the earliest book on North American insects. It included the illustrations and notes of John Abbot, with descriptions of new species by Smith based on Abbot&#x27;s drawings.

Smith&#x27;s friendship with William Roscoe (after whom he named the genus &quot;Roscoea&quot;) saw him contribute 5000 plants, between 1806 and 1817, to supplement the &quot;Roylean Herbarium&quot;. This was to become the &quot;Smith Herbarium&quot; held by the Liverpool Botanical Garden.

== Personal life and death ==
Smith died at his Norwich home in Surrey Street on March 17, 1828, aged 68. After his death the Linnean Collection, together with Smith&#x27;s own collections, were bought by the Linnean Society for £3,000.

He was married in 1796 to Pleasance Reeve, who survived him by 49 years and edited his memoirs and correspondence. They are buried together at St Margaret&#x27;s, Lowestoft. His niece, Frances Catherine Barnard (1796–1869), was an author.

==Eponymy==
The leguminous genus &quot;Smithia&quot; and the Himalayan spruce, &quot;Picea smithiana&quot;, are named for him.

<text>Frederick William Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol (2 October 1769 – 15 February 1859), styled Lord Hervey between 1796 and 1803 and known as The Earl of Bristol between 1803 and 1826, was a British peer.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frederick William Hervey was born on 2 October 1769, the son of Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Jermyn Davers, 4th Baronet. He was the younger son but, as his elder brother John Hervey died during their father&#x27;s lifetime, he succeeded to the title on the father&#x27;s death in 1803. He also had three sisters, Lady Mary Erne, Countess Erne, Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire and Louisa Jenkinson, Countess of Liverpool.

===Adult life===
Hervey was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1786. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1805.

Hervey served as an Ensign in the 1st Foot Guards from 1788 to 1793, and in 1798 was captain in a volunteer infantry regiment at Bury St Edmunds and Major-commandant of the Ickworth yeomanry which were both raised during the French Revolutionary War. Hervey was a member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds 1796–1803.

In 1806 he inherited the estates of his uncle, Sir Charles Davers, 6th Baronet.

In 1826, he was created Marquess of Bristol and Earl Jermyn. He was succeeded by his son Frederick William (1800–1864), M.P. for Bury St Edmunds 1830–1859, as 2nd Marquess.

===Personal life===
Hervey married Elizabeth Albana (1775–1844), daughter of Clotworthy Upton, 1st Baron Templetown and Elizabeth Upton, Baroness Templetown, by whom he had two daughters and six sons:
*Lady Augusta Hervey (29 December 1798 – 17 March 1880) married Frederick Charles William Seymour, son of Adm. Lord Hugh Seymour, and had six children.
*Frederick Hervey, 2nd Marquess of Bristol (15 July 1800 – 30 October 1864), the great-great-great-grandfather of the present Marquess
*Lady Georgiana Elizabeth Charlotte Hervey (8 September 1801 – 16 January 1869) married Rev. Hon. John Grey, son of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, and had three children.
*Major Lord George Hervey (25 January 1803 – 3 February 1838)
*Lord William Hervey (27 September 1805 – 6 May 1850), the great-great-grandfather of the current second in line to the marquessate
*Rt. Rev. Lord Arthur Charles Hervey (20 August 1808 – 9 June 1894), Bishop of Bath and Wells 
*Lady Sophia Elizabeth Caroline Hervey (26 April 1811 – 1 October 1863)
*Rev. Lord Charles Amelius Hervey (1 November 1814 – 11 April 1880), cricketer and clergyman
*Lord Alfred Hervey (25 June 1816 – 15 April 1875)

===Death===
He died on 15 February 1859 from gout. He had given the land for the Woodvale Cemetery at Brighton, where he was originally buried in the cruciform Gothic Revival tomb which still bears his name, but his body was later taken to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ickworth—the church closest to Ickworth House, where the Marquesses are traditionally buried. Cremated remains are now stored in the gable-topped mausoleum. It stands near the eponymous Bristol Ground, originally a pauper burial area within the Extra Mural Cemetery but now part of the Woodvale grounds: it has become a memorial garden attached to Woodvale crematorium.

<text>Web annotation can refer to online annotations of web resources such as web pages or parts of them, or a set of W3C standards developed for this purpose. The term can also refer to the creations of annotations on the World Wide Web and it has been used in this sense for the annotation tool INCEpTION, formerly WebAnno. This is a general feature of several tools for annotation in natural language processing or in the philologies.

== Annotation of web resources ==

With a web annotation system, a user can add, modify or remove information from a Web resource without modifying the resource itself. The annotations can be thought of as a layer on top of the existing resource, and this annotation layer is usually visible to other users who share the same annotation system. In such cases, the web annotation tool is a type of social software tool. For Web-based text annotation systems, see Text annotation.

Web annotation can be used for the following purposes:

* to rate a Web resource, such as by its usefulness, user-friendliness, suitability for viewing by minors.
* to improve or adapt its contents by adding/removing material (like wiki).
* as a collaborative tool, e.g. to discuss the contents of a certain resource.
* as a medium of artistic or social criticism, by allowing Web users to reinterpret, enrich or protest against institution or ideas that appear on the Web.
* to quantify transient relationships between information fragments.
*to save, retain and synthesize selected information.

Annotations can be considered an additional layer with respect to comments. Comments are published by the same publisher who hosts the original document. Annotations are added on top of that, but may eventually become comments which, in turn, may be integrated in a further version of the document itself.

== Web Annotation standard ==

In the Web Annotation standard,
The basic data structures of Web Annotation (Fig. 1) are 
* target (the element being annotated, e.g., a web document or a part of it),
* body (the content of the annotation, e.g., a string value), and
* annotation (the element that serves to relate body and target of an annotation)

The body can be a literal value or structured content (a URI). The target can be identified by an URI (e.g., fragment identifiers) and/or a selector that defines a domain-, resource- or application-specific access protocol, e.g., offset-based, XPath-based, etc.

Web Annotation was standardized on February 23, 2017 with the release of three official Recommendations by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group:

* Web Annotation Data Model
* Web Annotation Vocabulary
* Web Annotation Protocol

These recommendations were accompanied by additional working group notes that describe their application:

* Embedding Web Annotations in HTML
* Selectors and States

The Web Annotation data model is also provided in machine-readable form as the Web Annotation ontology.
Note that this ontology defines the Web Annotation namespace (codice_1), and that this namespace is conventionally abbreviated as codice_2. This is the abbreviation for &quot;Open Annotation&quot;, a W3C Community Group whose specifications formed the basis for the Web Annotation standard.

Web Annotation supersedes other standardization initiatives for annotations on the web within the W3C, e.g., the earlier Annotea project discontinued after 2003.

=== Related specifications ===

Web Annotation can be used in conjunction with (or as an alternative to) fragment identifiers that describe how to address elements within a web document by means of URIs. These include

* RFC 5147 (URI fragment identifiers for the text/plain media type)
* RFC 7111 (URI fragment identifiers for the text/csv media type)
* RFC 8118 (URI fragment identifiers for the application/pdf media type)
* SVG fragment identifiers
* XPointer (for addressing components of XML documents)
* Media Fragments (for addressing components of media files)

Other, non-standardized fragment identifiers are in use, as well, e.g., within the NLP Interchange Format.

Independently from Web Annotation, more specialized data models for representing annotations on the web have been developed, e.g., the NLP Interchange Format (NIF) for applications in language technology. In early 2020, the W3C Community Group &quot;Linked Data for Language Technology&quot; launched an initiative to harmonize these vocabularies and to develop a consolidated RDF vocabulary for linguistic annotations on the web.

== Web Annotation Systems ==

===Comparison of web annotation systems===
Many of these systems require software to be installed to enable some or all of the features below. This fact is only noted in footnotes if the software that is required is additional software provided by a third party.

<doc id="399933" wikidata="Q1012490" url="?curid=399933" title="Campbeltown">
<text>Campbeltown (; or ) is a town and former royal burgh in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It lies by Campbeltown Loch on the Kintyre Peninsula. Campbeltown became an important centre for Scotch whisky, and a busy fishing port.

The 2018 population estimate was 4,600 indicating a reduction since the 2011 census.

==History==
Originally known as Kinlochkilkerran (an anglicization of the Gaelic, which means &#x27;head of the loch by the kirk of Ciarán&#x27;), Campbeltown was renamed in the 17th century as &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Town&quot; after Archibald Campbell (Earl of Argyll) was granted the site in 1667. Campbeltown Town Hall was completed in 1760.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened Campbeltown Lifeboat Station in 1861. The present building dates from 1996.

==Economy==

In addition to the benefits of distilling, and whisky tourism, there were two major employers in 2018, Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind UK, who provided &quot;a substantial portion of the Campbeltown area’s high skilled jobs and are a vital part of the local economy,&quot; according to the Scottish government. A report in October 2019 had raised warning signs for the economy of Argyll &amp; Bute; the report also suggested that up to 70 jobs at CS Wind UK could be lost but did not specify a time frame.
Both companies confirmed the prediction of job redundancies, leading the Scottish government to hold an emergency summit in November 2019 to discuss steps that might be taken for improving the local economy. Participants included Argyll &amp; Bute Council, Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise, trades unions and local employers. After the summit, a &quot;working group&quot; was formed in late November 2019.

The number of dairy farms supplying Campbeltown Creamery reduced from 147 to 28 and the number of dairy cows fell from 6600 to 2500. Consequently, the Creamery became unviable. A plan by a small number of local dairy farmers to take over the running of the Creamery failed in early December 2019. The milk produced in Kintyre is now transported by road tankers to Lockerbie and Mull of Kintyre Cheddar is no longer available.

By early December 2019, CS Wind UK had declared 22 jobs redundant. The Scottish government was working with the company to search for long-term solutions. Preliminary discussions did not produce optimism about the future stability of the company. The Unite union indicated that while CS Wind had been profitable, it was not receiving an adequate number of orders to sustain full employment. The plant was shut down in 2019 and production shifted to CS Wind&#x27;s cheaper Vietnam plant in Phú Mỹ.

===Whisky===
Campbeltown is one of five areas in Scotland categorised as a distinct malt whisky producing region, and is home to the Campbeltown single malts. At one point it had over 30 distilleries and proclaimed itself &quot;the whisky capital of the world&quot;. However, a focus on quantity rather than quality, and the combination of Prohibition and the Great Depression in the United States, led to most distilleries going out of business. Today only three active distilleries remain in Campbeltown: Glen Scotia, Glengyle, and Springbank.

Campbeltown is a &quot;protected locality&quot; for Scotch Whisky distilling under the UK&#x27;s Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009.

The folk song titled &quot;Campbeltown Loch, I wish you were whisky&quot; is based on the town&#x27;s history in this industry.

==Climate==
As with the rest of Scotland, Campbeltown experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is at Campbeltown Airport/RAF Machrihanish, about west of the town centre.

The lowest temperature to be reported in recent years was during December 2010.

==Culture==

Campbeltown boasts a museum and a heritage centre. The museum has a varied collection of items from Campbeltown&#x27;s past, and prehistoric items excavated from sites around Kintyre, such as axeheads, jewellery and combs. The 19th-century building, by John James Burnet, also houses the Registrars office and Customer Service Point for Argyll and Bute council and has plaques or exhibits related to famous Kintyre people: for example, William McTaggart and William Mackinnon. Near the museum is the cinema known as the &quot;Wee Picture House&quot;, a small but distinctive Art Nouveau building of the Glasgow School dating from 1913 and believed to be the oldest surviving purpose-built cinema in Scotland. These buildings are on the waterfront, as is a 14th-century Celtic cross that also served as a mercat cross.

St Kieran (Ciarán of Clonmacnoise) lived in this area before the town existed. A cave named after him can be visited at low tide, as can the cave on nearby Island Davaar where pilgrims and tourists go to see a 19th-century crucifixion painting.

Campbeltown also hosts the annual Mull Of Kintyre Music Festival, which has seen acts ranging from up-and-coming local bands to well-established groups such as Deacon Blue, The Stranglers and Idlewild perform.

The Kintyre Songwriters Festival, a fairly low key annual gathering aimed at promoting the wealth and variety of original music across the area, which started in 2009. The festival is held during the last weekend of May and is open to anyone interested in performing.

On Friday 16 June 2006, First Minister Jack McConnell flew to Campbeltown to officially open Campbeltown&#x27;s new &#x27;Aqualibrium&#x27; Centre. Aqualibrium, designed by Page\Park Architects, replaced the old Campbeltown swimming pool, which was previously closed due to safety concerns; the centre houses Campbeltown&#x27;s library (with the old building being the museum only), swimming pool, gym, conference centre and &#x27;Mussel Ebb&#x27; Cafe.

The Kintyre Camanachd are a local shinty team that belongs to the Camanachd Association.

The local amateur football team, Campbeltown Pupils AFC, are members of the West of Scotland Football League Division 4 which largely comprises clubs based in the Greater Glasgow and Inverclyde areas, requiring the Campbeltown team to make a round trip of over for away fixtures most weekends.

Argyll FM is a local radio station based in Campbeltown on 106.5, 107.1 and 107.7.

In May 2012 Campbeltown and Dunoon were jointly named in a report by the Scottish Agricultural College as the rural places in Scotland most vulnerable to a downturn. The &quot;vulnerability index&quot; ranked 90 Scottish locations according to factors associated with economic and social change.

== Politics ==
Campbeltown is part of the Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber constituency for elections to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

==Infrastructure==
===Telecommunications===
The West Highland Telegraph was extended to Campbeltown in 1865 when the Universal Private Telegraph Company opened a telegraph office. 

The first telephone exchange was opened by the National Telephone Company in the early 1900s. It was modernised in 1939 with the introduction of direct dialling and went digital in 1991 following the upgrade of the Lochgilphead exchange.

===Electricity===

Electricity for domestic consumption arrived on 17 October 1935 when the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electric Power Company’s new power station in Glebe Street was inaugurated. The power station was built in the former premises of the Co-operative Society’s laundry. Two 150 h.p. oil fired engines drove the generators built by Ruston and Honsby. The street lighting in the town was converted from gas to electricity in 1936.

==Transport==
Campbeltown Airport is near the town, and has a scheduled service to/from Glasgow International Airport on weekdays and some summer Sundays.

The town is the westernmost town in the island of Great Britain (if the port of Mallaig is not counted as a town). It has the population of a large village, but lays claim to its town status based on its port and its central close grid of streets. Its position near the end of a long peninsula makes for a time-consuming road journey, and to some extent the area relies on sea and air transport, like the Inner Hebrides. However it is linked to the rest of Scotland by the A83 (to Tarbet) and A82 (from Tarbet to Glasgow). Bus service is provided by West Coast Motors, who also operate services to Glasgow for Scottish Citylink.

Ferries sail from Campbeltown to Ballycastle in Northern Ireland, operated by Kintyre Express. The service, which runs to Ballycastle every Friday to Monday during summer months and on Mondays and Fridays during the winter months, commenced in 2011.

In 2006 a foot passenger ferry operated by Kintyre Express ran between Campbeltown and Troon every Monday, Wednesday and Friday with a crossing time of one hour in calm weather. By 2007 this ferry no longer ran, although the vessel can be chartered privately.

Starting 23 May 2013, Caledonian MacBrayne began operating a ferry service across the Firth of Clyde to Ardrossan, calling at Brodick on Saturdays.

Campbeltown was linked to Machrihanish by a canal (1794 – mid-1880s) that was superseded by the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway, which closed in 1932. The railway, which was originally built to serve the Machrihanish Coalfield, ran from Campbeltown railway station to Machrihanish railway station.



==Language==
Campbeltown is one of the few communities in the Scottish Highlands where the Scots language predominated in recent centuries, rather than the previously widespread Scottish Gaelic, an enclave of Lowland Scots speech surrounded by Highland Scottish speech.

<text>Crail (; ) is a former royal burgh, parish and community council area (Royal Burgh of Crail and District) in the East Neuk of Fife, Scotland.

The locality has an estimated population of 1,630 (2018).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Crail&quot; was recorded in 1148 as &quot;Cherel&quot; and in 1153 as &quot;Karel&quot;. The first element is the Pictish &quot;*cair&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;caer&quot;) meaning &quot;fort&quot;, though this word seems to have been borrowed into Gaelic. The second element may be either Gaelic &quot;ail&quot;, &quot;rocks&quot;, or more problematically Pictish &quot;*al&quot;; no certain instance of this word exists in P-Celtic. However, if the generic element were Pictish, then this is likely of the specific.

==History==
The site on which the parish church is built appears to have religious associations that pre-date the parish church&#x27;s foundation in early medieval times, as evidenced by an 8th-century cross-slab preserved in the church. The parish church was itself dedicated (in the 13th-century) to the early holy man St. Maelrubha of Applecross in Wester Ross.

Crail Castle was an occasional residence of David I of Scotland during the 12th century but subsequently fell into ruin.

Crail became a royal burgh in 1178 during the reign of King William the Lion. Robert the Bruce granted permission to hold markets on a Sunday.

Mary of Guise, afterward consort of James V, landed in Crail in June 1538 after a severe storm, and was hospitably entertained in the ancient mansion of Balcomie Castle, whence, accompanied by the king, she proceeded to St. Andrew&#x27;s.

John Knox, visiting Crail on his way to St Andrews in 1559, was moved to deliver a sermon in Crail Parish Church. Afterwards, protesters went through the church and forcefully removed images which were put in place by previous generations but were now considered ideologically unsound. In August 1583, many of the inhabitants of Crail attacked nearby Wormiston House, which belonged to Sir John Anstruther. They filled up newly made ponds and ditches, and destroyed a plantation of ash trees. They were vexed at Anstruther because his new ditches had been built on land they claimed to belong to them as common land. The Privy Council of Scotland ordered them to rebuild the dykes.

In 2017, the Community Council was granted the Letters Patent to the Crail Shield and Coat of Arms. This was lost when the Royal Burgh of Crail Council was abolished in 1976.

==Architecture==

The most notable building in the town is the parish church, situated in the Marketgate – from the mid-13th century St Maelrubha&#x27;s, in later medieval times St Mary&#x27;s, but now, as part of the Church of Scotland&#x27;s ministry, known just as Crail Parish Church. It was founded in the second half of the 12th century. From early in its history, it belonged to the Cistercian Nunnery of St Clare in Haddington, East Lothian, and remained the Nunnery&#x27;s possession until the Reformation. The kirkyard also includes a war memorial gateway of 1921.

Crail Tolbooth is near the juncture of Tolbooth Wynd and the Marketgate. It stands on its own at the edge of the large marketplace with its Mercat cross in the centre of the town. This is where the Sunday markets were once held. (The former marketplace is now used as a car park.) The tolbooth has a characteristic tower dating from about 1600 and a European-style roof, similar to buildings in Holland. The weathervane on the spire is in the form of a smoked haddock (known locally as a &quot;Crail Capon&quot;) rather than the traditional cockerel form.

The Crail Museum and Heritage Centre, largely staffed by volunteers and open every day in summer, is sited in a neighbouring building, also of historical interest, at the top of Tolbooth Wynd. It houses temporary exhibitions and has a permanent exhibition on RNAS Crail.

The Golf Hotel, on High Street, is Category A listed, dating to the 18th century or earlier.

==Harbour==
In 1610, the eastern pier was described as &quot;new foundit&quot; (newly built); however, by 1707 it was called &quot;old and ruinous&quot;, requiring rebuilding.

The west pier was rebuilt in 1828 by Robert Stevenson. This work incorporated the crane on the southwest corner which lifts timbers into slots to seal the inner harbour.

The structure of the inner walls of the harbour features a highly unusual vertical coursing of the stones.

==Notable residents==
*Andrew Duncan, minister exiled for opposing the policies of James VI ( c.1560–1626)
*James Sharp, became Archbishop of St Andrews (1618–1679)
*James Oswald (1710–1769), composer
*William Dickson, footballer (1866–1910)
*Oswald Wynd, author (1913–1998)
*Joan Clarke, cryptanalyst and former fiancée of Alan Turing (1917–1996)
*King Creosote, singer-songwriter (1967–)

==Carboniferous fossils==
On the beach beside the harbour, there are fossilised trees related to Horsetails, dating back to the Carboniferous geological period.

==Sport==
The Crail Golfing Society, formed in 1766, is the seventh-oldest in the world. Their oldest course, Balcomie, was formally laid out by Tom Morris Sr. in 1894, but competitions had been played there since the 1850s.

==Public transport==
Stagecoach East Scotland&#x27;s bus service 95 from Leven to St Andrews via Pittenweem and Anstruther is the only bus service which serves Crail. The hourly service runs every day.

<text>The bass clarinet is a musical instrument of the clarinet family. Like the more common soprano B clarinet, it is usually pitched in B (meaning it is a transposing instrument on which a written C sounds as B), but it plays notes an octave below the soprano B clarinet. Bass clarinets in other keys, notably C and A, also exist, but are very rare (in contrast to the regular A clarinet, which is quite common in classical music). Bass clarinets regularly perform in orchestras, wind ensembles and concert bands, and occasionally in marching bands, and play an occasional solo role in contemporary music and jazz in particular.

Someone who plays a bass clarinet is called a bass clarinettist or a bass clarinetist.

==Description==

Most modern bass clarinets are straight-bodied, with a small upturned silver-colored metal bell and curved metal neck. Early examples varied in shape, some having a doubled body making them look similar to bassoons. The bass clarinet is fairly heavy and is supported either with a neck strap or an adjustable peg attached to its body. While Adolphe Sax imitated its upturned metal bell in his design of the larger saxophones, the two instruments are fundamentally different. Bass clarinet bodies are most often made of grenadilla (African Blackwood) or (more commonly for student-instruments) plastic resin, while saxophones are typically made of metal. (Metal bass clarinets exist, but are rare.) More significantly, all clarinets have a bore that is basically the same diameter along the body. This cylindrical bore differs from the saxophone&#x27;s conical one and gives the clarinet its characteristic tone, causing it to overblow at the twelfth (octave + fifth) compared with the saxophone&#x27;s octave.

A majority of modern bass clarinets, like other clarinets in the family, have the Boehm system of keys and fingering. However, bass clarinets are also manufactured in Germany with the Oehler system of keywork, which is most often known as the &#x27;German&quot; system in the US, because it is commonly used in Germany and Austria, as well as Eastern Europe and Turkey; bass clarinets produced with the Oehler system&#x27;s predecessor, the Albert system, are still in use, particularly in these areas.

Most modern Boehm system bass clarinets have an &quot;extension&quot; key allowing them to play to the (written) E. This key was originally added to allow easy transposition of parts for the relatively rare bass clarinet pitched in A, but it now finds significant use in concert band and other literature. A significant difference between soprano and bass clarinet key work is a key pad played by the left-hand index finger with a vent that may be uncovered for certain high notes. This allows a form of &quot;half-hole&quot; fingering that allows notes in higher registers to be played on the instrument. In addition, older bass clarinets have two register keys, one for middle D and below, the other for middle E and higher. Newer models typically have an automatic register key mechanism, where a single left thumb key commands the two vent holes. Depending on whether the right hand ring finger (used in fingerings for middle D and below) is down or up, the lower or upper vent hole will open.

Many professional or advanced bass clarinet models extend down to a low C (sounding B, identical to the bassoon&#x27;s lowest B), two octaves below written middle C. At concert pitch this note is the B below the second ledger line below the bass staff or B1 in scientific pitch notation. These three lowermost half-steps are played via additional keys operated by the right thumb, some of them often duplicated in the left- or right-hand little-finger key clusters. Overall, the instrument sounds an octave lower than the B soprano clarinet.

As with all wind instruments, the upper limit of the range depends on the quality of the instrument and skill of the clarinetist. According to Aber and Lerstad, who give fingerings up to written C7 (sounding B5), the highest note commonly encountered in modern solo literature is the E below that (sounding D5, the D above treble C). This gives the bass clarinet a usable range of up to four octaves, quite close to the range of the bassoon; indeed, many bass clarinetists perform works originally intended for bassoon or cello because of the plethora of literature for those two instruments and the scarcity of solo works for the bass clarinet.

==Uses==

The bass clarinet has been regularly used in scoring for orchestra and concert band since the mid-19th century, becoming more common during the middle and latter part of the 20th century. A bass clarinet is not always called for in orchestra music, but is almost always called for in concert band music. In recent years, the bass clarinet has also seen a growing repertoire of solo literature including compositions for the instrument alone, or accompanied by piano, orchestra, or other ensemble. It is also used in clarinet choirs, marching bands, and in film scoring, and has played a persistent role in jazz.

The bass clarinet has an appealing, rich, earthy and inky tone, quite distinct from other instruments in its range, drawing on and enhancing the qualities of the lower range of the soprano and alto instrument.

===Musical compositions===
Perhaps the earliest solo passages for bass clarinet—indeed, among the earliest parts for the instrument—occur in Mercadante&#x27;s 1834 opera &quot;Emma d&#x27;Antiochia&quot;, in which a lengthy solo introduces Emma&#x27;s scene in Act 2. (Mercadante actually specified a glicibarifono for this part.) Two years later, Giacomo Meyerbeer wrote an important solo for bass clarinet in Act 4 of his opera &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;.

French composer Hector Berlioz was one of the first of the Romantics to use the bass clarinet in his large-scale works such as the &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot;, Op. 15 (1840), the &quot;Te Deum&quot;, Op. 22 (1849), and the opera &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, Op. 29 (1863). Later French composers to use the instrument included Maurice Ravel, who wrote virtuosic parts for the bass clarinet in his ballet &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; (1912), &quot;La valse&quot; (1920), and his orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (1924).

The operas of Richard Wagner also make extensive use of the bass clarinet, beginning with &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (1845). He incorporated the instrument fully into the wind section as both a solo and supporting instrument. Wagner pioneered in exploiting the instrument&#x27;s dark, somber tone to represent sadness and melancholy. Wagner was almost completely responsible for making the instrument a permanent member of the opera orchestra. The instrument plays an extensive role in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (1859), the operas of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (1876), and &quot;Parsifal&quot; (1882).

Also around this time, Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt wrote important parts for the instrument in his symphonic poems &quot;Ce qu&#x27;on entend sur la montagne&quot; (&quot;What One Hears on the Mountain&quot;), &quot;Tasso&quot;, and his &quot;Dante Symphony&quot;. Giuseppe Verdi followed suit, using it in Ernani, &quot;Aida&quot; (1870), &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, &quot;Don Carlo&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;. Following in Verdi&#x27;s footsteps, Giacomo Puccini, composer of &quot;La Bohème&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, used the bass clarinet in all of his operas, beginning with &quot;Edgar&quot; in 1889. The Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote some prominent solos for the instrument in his last ballet, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

The later Romantics used the bass clarinet frequently in their works. All of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s symphonies include the instrument prominently, and often contain lengthy solos for the instrument, especially in his Symphony No. 6 in A minor. Richard Strauss wrote for the instrument in all of his symphonic poems except for &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and the instrument shared the spotlight with the tenor tuba in his 1898 tone poem, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Op. 35. Strauss wrote for the instrument as he did for the smaller clarinets, and the parts often include playing in very high registers, such as in &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;, Op. 30.

Composers of the Second Viennese School, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg, often favored the instrument over the bassoon, the instrument&#x27;s closest relative in terms of range. Russian composers Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev used the low concert C and B (equivalent to the bassoon&#x27;s lowest two notes) in many of their compositions and an instrument with the extended range is necessary for works such as Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11, and Leoš Janáček&#x27;s Sinfonietta. All of these works exploit the instrument&#x27;s dark, powerful lower range.

Prokofiev wrote parts for the instrument in his Symphonies Nos. 2–7 and in his ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Sergei Rachmaninoff used the instrument to great effect in his Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 and in his symphonic poem, &quot;Isle of The Dead&quot;. Igor Stravinsky also wrote complex parts for the instrument throughout his career, most prominently in his ballets &quot;The Firebird&quot; (1910), &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911) and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913).

The bass clarinet has a solo at the opening of the third movement of Ferde Grofé&#x27;s Grand Canyon Suite.

In the duet &quot;A Boy Like That&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1957), Leonard Bernstein scored for &quot;the inky sounds of three bass clarinets&quot;.

Early minimalist Steve Reich&#x27;s &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot; (1976) calls for two bass clarinets, featured prominently in the lower register. Used almost percussively, the effect of deep, staccato repetitions, played beneath a static rhythmic drone, is to create a feeling of slowly fluctuating cycles.

One of the most performed works for Bass Clarinet is Marc Mellits&#x27;s Black, with over 3,000 performances as of 2024.

Many modern composers employ the bass along with the contra-alto and contrabass clarinets, such as Esa-Pekka Salonen in his Piano Concerto. A great amount of literature can be found in the wind ensemble, in which there is always a part for the instrument.

There are many important solo pieces, duos, sonatas and concertos for bass clarinet, including:

There is a rich and diverse chamber repertoire for bass clarinet and other instruments, including Leoš Janáček&#x27;s suite &quot;Mládí&quot; (&quot;Youth&quot;), Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Kontra-Punkte&quot;, Theo Loevendie&#x27;s &quot;Plus One&quot; for flute, bass clarinet &amp; piano and Beat Furrer&#x27;s &quot;Gaspra&quot; for ensemble incl. bass clarinet.

===Soloists and ensembles===
It was not until the 1950s that classical performers began to adopt the bass clarinet as their primary instrument. The pioneer was the Czech performer Josef Horák (1931–2005), who is credited as having performed the first ever solo bass clarinet recital on March 23, 1955. This marked a turning point when the instrument first became thought of as a soloist&#x27;s instrument.

Because the repertoire of solo music for the bass clarinet was quite small, most bass clarinet soloists specialize in new music, while also arranging works composed for other instruments from earlier eras (such as the Bach Cello Suites). Beginning with Horák, many players have commissioned works for the instrument, and consequently there now exists a repertoire of hundreds of solo works, many by prominent international composers such as Brian Ferneyhough and David Lang. In addition to Horák, other specialist performers include Henri Bok (Netherlands), his student Luís Afonso (Brazil), Dennis Smylie (United States), Tommie Lundberg (Sweden), Harry Sparnaay (Netherlands, who has worked with important composers such as Luciano Berio, Iannis Xenakis, and Morton Feldman), Fie Schouten (artistic director Basklarinet Festijn; worked with o.a. Georges Aperghis, Michael Finnissy, Theo Loevendie, Louis Sclavis, Rozalie Hirs) Jason Alder, Evan Ziporyn (United States), and Michael Lowenstern (United States); the latter two are also composers.

In October 2005, the First World Bass Clarinet Convention was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, at which Horák was the guest of honor and played in one of the many concerts given by the leading bass clarinetists from around the world (including all the aforementioned performers, as well as many others).

In April 2014, 70th birthday of Harry Sparnaay the first Basklarinet Festijn was held in the Netherlands. Initiators and artistic leaders are former students of Sparnaay and active in contemporary composed and improvised music: Fie Schouten and Tobias Klein.

At least two professional bass-clarinet quartets exist. Rocco Parisi&#x27;s Bass Clarinet Quartet is an Italian group whose repertoire includes transcriptions of music by Rossini, Paganini, and Piazzolla. Edmund Welles is the name of a bass clarinet quartet based in San Francisco. Their repertoire includes original &quot;heavy chamber music&quot; and transcriptions of madrigals, boogie-woogie tunes, and heavy metal songs. Two of the members of Edmund Welles also perform as a bass clarinet duo, Sqwonk.

===In jazz===
While the bass clarinet was seldom heard in early jazz compositions, a bass clarinet solo by Wilbur Sweatman can be heard on his 1924 recording &quot;Battleship Kate&quot; and a bass clarinet solo by Omer Simeon can be heard in the 1926 recording &quot;Someday Sweetheart&quot; by Jelly Roll Morton and His Red Hot Peppers. Additionally, Benny Goodman recorded with the instrument a few times early in his career.

Harry Carney, Duke Ellington&#x27;s baritone saxophonist for 47 years, played bass clarinet in some of Ellington&#x27;s arrangements, first recording with it on &quot;Saddest Tale&quot; in 1934. He was featured soloist on many Ellington recordings, including 27 titles on bass clarinet.

The first jazz album on which the leader solely played bass clarinet was &quot;Great Ideas of Western Mann&quot; (1957) by Herbie Mann, better known as a flautist. However, avant-garde musician Eric Dolphy (1928–1964) was the first major jazz soloist on the instrument, and established much of the vocabulary and technique used by later performers. He used the entire range of the instrument in his solos. Bennie Maupin emerged in the late 1960s as a primary player of the instrument, playing on Miles Davis&#x27;s seminal record &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; as well as several records with Herbie Hancock&#x27;s Mwandishi group. His style resembles Dolphy&#x27;s in its use of advanced harmonies.

While the bass clarinet has been used often since Dolphy, it is typically used by a saxophonist or clarinetist as a second or third instrument; such musicians include David Murray, Marcus Miller, John Surman, John Gilmore, Bob Mintzer, John Coltrane (to whom Dolphy&#x27;s mother left some of Dolphy&#x27;s instruments including his bass clarinet), Brian Landrus, James Carter, Steve Buckley, Andy Biskin, Don Byron, Julian Siegel, Gunter Hampel, Michel Portal, Myron Walden, Yusef Lateef, Paul McCandless, Gianluigi Trovesi, and Chris Potter. Very few performers have used the instrument exclusively, but such performers include American Michael Pinz, Berlin-based bass clarinetist Rudi Mahall, and French bass clarinetists Louis Sclavis and Denis Colin. Klezmer clarinetist Giora Feidman is known for idiosyncratic use of the bass clarinet on some klezmer and jazz tunes.

===In rock===

On The Beatles 1967 recording of George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;, a prominent bass clarinet ostinato, scored and conducted by producer George Martin, is played by session musician Paul Harvey.

The Mascara Snake (Victor Hayden) was a member of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s band in the late 1960s, playing bass clarinet on the 1969 album &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;.

On Steely Dan&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;, bass clarinets are played by George Marge and Walter Kane.

On Paramore&#x27;s 2023 album This Is Why, the song &quot;Figure 8&quot; prominently features a bass clarinet. The part is played by Henry Solomon. 

==History==
There are several instruments that can arguably be considered the first bass clarinet. Probably the earliest is a dulcian-shaped instrument in the Museum Carolino Augusteum in Salzburg. It is incomplete, lacking a crook or mouthpiece, and appears to date from the first half of the eighteenth century. Its wide cylindrical bore and its fingering suggest it was a chalumeau or clarinet in the bass range. Four anonymous bass chalumeaux or clarinets apparently dating from the eighteenth century and having from one to six keys also appear to be among the earliest examples, and one in particular has been suggested to date from before 1750. However, the authenticity of at least one of these instruments has been questioned.

In the Munich Stadtmuseum there is an instrument made c. 1770 by the Mayrhofers of Passau, who are often credited with the invention of the basset horn. It resembles early sickle-shaped basset horns, but has a larger bore and is longer, playing in low B. Whether this should be considered a low basset horn or a bass clarinet is a matter of opinion. In any case, no further work along this line is known to have been done.

A 1772 newspaper article describes an instrument called the , invented by G. Lott in Paris in 1772. This instrument has not survived and very little is known of it. The article has frequently been cited as the earliest record of a bass clarinet, but it has more recently been suggested that the basse-tube was in fact a basset horn.

The &quot;Klarinetten-Bass&quot; by Heinrich Grenser, c. 1793, had a folded, bassoon-like shape and an extended range, and was presumably intended to serve as a bassoon replacement in military bands. Desfontenelles of Lisieux built a bass clarinet in 1807 whose shape was similar to that of the later saxophone. It had thirteen keys, at a time when most soprano clarinets had fewer.

Additional designs were developed by many other makers, including Dumas of Sommières (who called his instrument a ) in 1807; Nicola Papalini, c. 1810 (an odd design, in the form of a serpentine series of curves, carved out of wood); George Catlin of Hartford, Connecticut () c. 1810; Sautermeister of Lyons () in 1812; Gottlieb Streitwolf in 1828; and Catterino Catterini () in the 1830s. These last four, and several others of the same period, had bassoon-like folded shapes, and most had extended ranges. A straight-bodied instrument without extended range was produced in 1832 by Isaac Dacosta and Auguste Buffet.

Finally, Adolphe Sax, a Belgian manufacturer of musical instruments, designed a straight-bodied form of the bass clarinet in 1838. Sax&#x27;s expertise in acoustics led him to include such features as accurately-placed, large tone holes and a second register hole. His instrument achieved great success and became the basis for all bass clarinet designs since.

The instrument on which Anton Stadler first played Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s clarinet concerto was originally called a , but was not a bass clarinet in the modern sense; since the late eighteenth century this instrument has been called a basset clarinet.

==Notation==
Orchestral music for bass clarinet is written using one of four systems:

Music is occasionally encountered written for the bass clarinet in A, e.g., in Wagner operas, and Mahler or Rachmaninov symphonies. This music tends to be written in bass clef, although not invariably (e.g. Ravel&#x27;s &quot;La Valse&quot;). Probably the first bass clarinet in A was made by Johann Adam Henkel, around 1850, and a number of greater and lesser known makers continued to produce examples over the next 70 years: e.g., Stengel, Moritz, Kruspe, &quot;et al&quot;. Buffet made some instruments in the 1920s, but the bass in A was never produced in any great numbers, and after the 1920s very few instruments in A were made (although Fritz Wurlitzer experimented with one in the 1940s).

Despite its relative rarity, important works by some prominent composers featured the bass clarinet in A, and in the early 20th century makers began regularly offering B♭ bass clarinets equipped with an E extension key, so that bass parts in A could be transposed onto the B♭ instrument.

In the 1970s there was a mild revival of interest in the instrument, and Selmer of Paris produced a few instruments pitched in A with Boehm system key work and keyed to low E (even though the original parts seldom descend below written low E). However, these instruments were expensive and many players were reluctant to haul around two heavy bass clarinets to rehearsals and performances, so few of the modern bass clarinets in A were sold. Selmer ceased production of the bass clarinet in A in the late 1980s. Today, very few players own a bass clarinet in A and these parts are generally played on the B instrument, transposing them down a semitone.

<doc id="399943" wikidata="Q2342809" url="?curid=399943" title="George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol">
<text>George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol (5 November 161220 March 1677) was an English politician and peer who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 until 1641, when he was raised to the House of Lords by a writ of acceleration. He supported the Royalists during the English Civil War, but his ambition and instability of character caused serious problems to himself and both Kings he served.

==Early life==
Digby was baptized in Madrid, the eldest known son of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol, who for many years was the English Ambassador to Spain, and his wife Beatrice Walcott. He is presumed to have been born there shortly before. At the age of twelve, he appeared at the bar of the House of Commons and pleaded for his father who was then imprisoned in the Tower of London. His youth, graceful person and well-delivered speech made a great impression. He was admitted to Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 August 1626, where he was a favourite pupil of Peter Heylin. He spent the following years in study and in travel, from which he returned, according to George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, &quot;the most accomplished person of our nation or perhaps any other nation, and distinguished by a remarkably handsome person&quot;. In June 1634 Digby was committed to the Fleet Prison till July for striking Crofts, a gentleman of the court, in Spring Gardens, and possibly his severe treatment and the disfavour shown to his father were the causes of his hostility to the court. He became MA in 1636. In 1638 and 1639 were written the &quot;Letters between Lord George Digby and Sir Kenelm Digby, Knt. concerning Religion&quot; (published in 1651), in which Digby attacked Roman Catholicism.

==Politics and the Civil War==

In April 1640, Digby was elected member of parliament for Dorset in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Dorset for the Long Parliament in November 1640. In conjunction with John Pym and John Hampden he took an active part in the opposition to Charles I of England. He moved on 9 November for a committee to consider the deplorable state of the kingdom, and on 11 November was included in the committee for the impeachment of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, against whom he at first showed great zeal. However, after the failure of the impeachment, he opposed the attainder of Strafford, and made an eloquent speech on 21 April 1641, accentuating the weakness of Henry Vane&#x27;s evidence against the prisoner, and showing the injustice of &quot;ex post facto&quot; legislation, in condemning a man for acts which were not treason when they were committed. He was regarded in consequence with great hostility by the parliamentary party, and was accused of having stolen from Pym&#x27;s table Vane&#x27;s notes on which the prosecution mainly depended. On 15 July his speech was burnt by the public hangman by the order of the House of Commons.

On 8 February he made an important speech in the Commons advocating the reformation and opposing the abolition of episcopacy. On 8 June, during the angry discussion on the army plot, he narrowly escaped assault in the House, and the following day, in order to save him from further attacks, Charles I of England called him up to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s Barony of Digby.

King Charles mistakenly followed Digby&#x27;s advice in preference to such men as Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. In November 1641 Digby was recorded as performing &quot;singular good service&quot;, and &quot;doing beyond admiration&quot;, in speaking in the Lords against the instruction concerning evil counsellors. He suggested to Charles the impeachment of the five members, and urged upon him the fatal attempt to arrest them on 4 January 1642. He failed to play his part in the Lords in securing the arrest of Lord Mandeville, to whom on the contrary he declared that the king was very mischievously advised, and according to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon his imprudence was responsible for the betrayal of the king&#x27;s plan. On the next day, Digby advised the attempt to seize the five members in the city by force.

In the same month Digby was ordered to appear in the Lords to answer a charge of high treason for a supposed armed attempt at Hull, but fled to the Dutch Republic, where he joined Queen consort Henrietta Maria of France, and on 26 February was impeached.

Subsequently, he visited Charles at York disguised as a Frenchman, but on the return voyage to the Dutch Republic, he was captured and taken to Hull. For some time he escaped detection, but at last, after revealing his identity, he cajoled Sir John Hotham into letting him escape. Later on a second visit to Hull, he tried unsuccessfully to persuade Hotham to surrender York to the King. He was present at the Battle of Edgehill, and was wounded while leading the assault at Lichfield. After a quarrel with Prince Rupert of the Rhine, he threw down his commission and returned to the King at Oxford, over whom he obtained more influence as the prospect became more gloomy.

On 28 September 1643 he was appointed secretary of state and a privy councillor, and on 31 October high steward of Oxford University. He now supported Henrietta Maria&#x27;s policy of foreign alliances and use of help from Ireland, and took part in several imprudent and ill-conducted negotiations which damaged the king&#x27;s affairs. His fierce disputes with Prince Rupert and his party caused further embarrassment.

On 14 October 1645, he was made lieutenant general of the royal forces north of the River Trent. The intention was to push through to join James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, but he was defeated on 15 October at Sherburn, where his correspondence was captured. This correspondence revealed the king&#x27;s expectations from abroad and from Ireland and his intrigues with the Scots. Digby reached Dumfries, but finding his way barred, escaped on 24 October to the Isle of Man. He then crossed to Ireland, where he caused Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, who had been sent to negotiate with the Irish Confederacy, to be arrested. In Ireland, he believed he was going to achieve wonders. &quot;Have I not carried my body swimmingly,&quot; he wrote to Hyde in irrepressible good spirits, &quot;who being before so irreconcilably hated by the Puritan party, have thus seasonably made myself as odious to the Papists?&quot; 

== Exile ==

Digby&#x27;s plan was to bring over Charles, Prince of Wales, to head a royalist movement on the island. When he joined Charles at Jersey in April 1646, he intended to entrap him on board, but was dissuaded by Hyde. Digby then travelled to Paris to gain Henrietta Maria of France&#x27;s consent to his scheme, but returned to persuade Charles to go to Paris, and accompanied him thither. He revisited Ireland on 29 June once more, and on the surrender of the island to Parliament escaped again to France.

At Paris, amongst the Royalists, he found himself in a nest of enemies eager to pay off old scores. Prince Rupert challenged him, and he fought a duel with Lord Wilmot. He continued his adventures by serving in Louis XIV of France&#x27;s troops in the war of the Fronde, in which he greatly distinguished himself. He was appointed in 1651 lieutenant-general in the French army, and commander of the forces in Flanders. These new honours, however, were soon lost.

During Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s enforced absence from the court Digby aspired to become his successor. However, when the Cardinal was restored to power, he sent Digby away on an expedition in Italy, having penetrated his character and regarded him as a mere adventurer. When Digby returned to France he was told that he was included in the list of those expelled from France, in accordance with the new treaty with Oliver Cromwell.

In August 1656 he joined Charles II at Bruges, and wanting revenge on the cardinal, offered his services to John of Austria the Younger in the Southern Netherlands. He was instrumental in effecting the surrender of the garrison of St. Ghislain to Spain in 1657. On 1 January 1657, he was appointed by Charles II secretary of state, but shortly afterwards, he was compelled to resign office as he had become a Roman Catholic — probably with the view of adapting himself better to his new Spanish friends. Charles took him with him to Spain in 1659 on account of his &quot;jollity &quot; and Spanish experience.

Although unwelcome to the Spanish, he succeeded in ingratiating himself, and was later welcomed by Philip IV of Spain at Madrid. Digby succeeded to the peerage as 2nd Earl of Bristol on the death of his father in January 1653 and was made K.G. the same month.

== Restoration ==

As Lord Bristol, he returned to the Kingdom of England at the English Restoration, when he found himself excluded from office on account of his religion, and relegated to only secondary importance. He tried to make an impression through restless and ambitious activity in parliament and he was violently hostile to Clarendon. In foreign affairs, he inclined strongly to the side of Spain, and opposed the king&#x27;s marriage with Catherine of Braganza. He persuaded Charles to despatch him to Italy to view the Medici princesses, but the royal marriage and treaty with Portugal were settled in his absence.

In June 1663 Bristol tried to upset Clarendon&#x27;s management of the House of Commons, but his intrigue was exposed to the parliament by Charles, and he had to attend the House of Lords to exonerate himself. When he confessed that he had &quot;taken the liberty of enlarging&quot;, his &quot;comedian-like&quot; speech excited general amusement. In July, he broke out into fierce and disrespectful reproaches to the King, ending with a threat that unless Charles granted his requests within twenty-four hours &quot;he would do somewhat that should awaken him out of his slumbers, and make him look better to his own business&quot;. Accordingly, on 10 July he impeached Clarendon in the Lords of high treason. When the charge was dismissed he renewed his accusation, was expelled from the court, and only avoided the warrant issued for his apprehension by hiding for two years.

In January 1664 Bristol appeared at his house at Wimbledon, and publicly renounced before witnesses his Roman Catholicism and declared himself a Protestant. His motive was probably to secure immunity from the charge of recusancy preferred against him. When, however, the fall of Clarendon was desired, Bristol was again welcomed at court. He took his seat in the Lords on 29 July 1667. &quot;The king,&quot; wrote Samuel Pepys in November, &quot;who not long ago did say of Bristol that he was a man able in three years to get himself a fortune in any kingdom in the world and lose all again in three months, do now hug him and commend his parts everywhere above all the world.&quot; He pressed eagerly for Clarendon&#x27;s committal, and on the refusal of the Lords accused them of mutiny and rebellion, and entered his dissent with &quot;great fury&quot;.

In March 1668, Bristol attended prayers in the Lords. On 15 March 1673 though still ostensibly a Roman Catholic, he spoke in favour of the Test Act, describing himself as &quot;a Catholic of the Church of Rome, not a Catholic of the Court of Rome&quot;, and asserting the unfitness of Romanists for public office. In 1674, he acquired Buckingham House (later Beaufort House) in Chelsea. His adventurous and erratic career was closed by his death on 20 March 1677.

==Character==

Bristol was one of the most striking and conspicuous figures of his time, a man of brilliant abilities, a great orator, one who distinguished himself without effort in any sphere of activity he chose to enter, but whose natural gifts were marred by a restless ambition and instability of character fatal to real greatness.

Clarendon describes him as &quot;the only man I ever knew of such incomparable parts that was none the wiser for any experience or misfortune that befell him&quot;, and records his extraordinary facility in making friends and making enemies. Horace Walpole characterized him in a series of his smartest antitheses as &quot;a singular person whose life was one contradiction&quot;. &quot;He wrote against popery and embraced it; he was a zealous opposer of the court and a sacrifice for it; was conscientiously converted in the midst of his prosecution of Lord Strafford and was most unconscientiously a persecutor of Lord Clarendon. With great parts, he always hurt himself and his friends; with romantic bravery, he was always an unsuccessful commander. He spoke for the Test Act, though a Roman Catholic; and addicted himself to astrology on the birthday of true philosophy.&quot; Samuel Pepys in 1668 records in the great Diary an outburst against Bristol from an elderly Cavalier, Mr Ball: &quot;I said at the King&#x27;s coming back that the nation could never be safe while that man was alive&quot;.

Besides his youthful correspondence with Sir Kenelm Digby on the subject of religion, already mentioned, he was the author of an &quot;Apology&quot; (1643) [Thomason Tracts, E. 34 (32)], justifying his support of the king&#x27;s cause; of a comedy, &quot;Elvira&quot; (1667) [Printed in R. Dodsley&#x27;s Select Collection of Old English Plays (Hazlitt, 1876), vol. xv], and of &quot;Worse and Worse&quot;, an adaptation from the Spanish, acted but not printed. Other writings are also ascribed to him, including the authorship with Sir Samuel Tuke of &quot;The Adventures of Five Hours&quot; (1663). His eloquent and pointed speeches, many of which were printed, are included in the article in the Biog. Brit. and among the Thomason Tracts; see also the general catalogue in the British Museum. The catalogue of his library was published in 1680.

==Family==

Bristol married Lady Anne Russell, a daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford and his wife Catherine Brydges. She died in 1697. They were parents to four children:

*John Digby, 3rd Earl of Bristol (c. 163518 September 1698). He married twice, firstly Alice Bourne and secondly Rachel Wyndham, but died without issue, and the peerage became extinct.
*Francis Digby (d. 1672), died unmarried.
*Diana Digby, who married in 1658 Rene de Mol, Baron de Herent (died 1691), a nobleman of Flanders and had issue, including Jean-Baptiste, Baron de Herent, who was later styled &quot;Comte de Bristole&quot;. Like her father, she was a convert to Catholicism.
*Anne Digby (d. 26 April 1715), who married Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland. From her descended Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York (b. 1959) and Diana, Princess of Wales (1961–1997).

<doc id="399945" wikidata="Q1011787" url="?curid=399945" title="Girvan">
<text>Girvan (, &quot;mouth of the River Girvan&quot;) is a burgh and harbour town in Carrick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Girvan is situated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,450. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland.

Deriving its name from the river which runs through the landscape the etymology of Girvan has possible Brythonic origins, related to the Welsh: &quot;Gearafon&quot; or &quot;Gwyrddafon&quot;, &quot;river flowing through the green flourishing place, from afon or avon, a river, and Gwyrdd, green, flourishing&quot;.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
The earliest evidence of human habitation in the Girvan area dates to the Mesolithic.

Between 1996 and 1998, archaeological investigations were undertaken by GUARD archaeology (then part of the University of Glasgow) as part of an expansion of the William Grant &amp; Sons distillery. This work discovered several burnt mounds that dated to the later third millennium/early second millennium BC and an Iron Age trackway. They also discovered a medieval moated enclosure, which is a house or compound surrounded by a moat. These are usually the homes of minor aristocracy but are rare in Scotland (of the roughly 5400 known from mainland Britain, only ~120 are in Scotland). It is surmised that it might have belong to the Bruce family group, either a relative or a supporter and that it was likely that the house would have been known to Robert the Bruce, as he was born at Turnberry.

Two Roman camps lie half a mile (0.8 km) north of the estuary of the Water of Girvan in level fields of Girvan Mains Farm. The discovery of a fragment of a late first-century glass vessel in the primary ditch-fill of the second camp, combined with the almost square plan of the first, makes it entirely reasonable to assume that these were bases used by the forces of Agricola during the campaigns 78-84 AD mentioned by Tacitus in (de Vita Agricolae, cap xxiv) as relating to a possible descent upon Ireland. The provision of a beach head at either site would have allowed the camps to fulfill the function of a base for Agricolan combined army and naval operations around the Scottish coast.

==History==
Girvan was originally a fishing port. In 1668, it became a municipal burgh incorporated by charter.

The opening of the railways, initially with the Maybole and Girvan Railway at the end of the 1850s, encouraged the development of Girvan as a seaside resort with beaches and cliffs. Holidaying here from 1855 to 1941 were Robert and Elizabeth Gray and their children; particularly Alice and Edith Gray. The family, led principally by Elizabeth and Alice, created scientifically organised collections of fossils for several museums including the Natural History Museum.

Girvan Lifeboat Station was opened by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1865 with a boathouse was built on land donated by the Duchesse de Coigny. It moved to its present site in 1993. Since 2018 it has operated the Shannon-class lifeboat RNLB &quot;Elizabeth and Gertrude Allan&quot;.

Just north of the town is Grangestone Industrial Estate, which hosts a William Grant &amp; Sons distillery which opened in 1964. There is a Nestlé factory that manufactures chocolate that is shipped down to York and used in Kit Kat and Yorkie bars.

On 12 October 2024, a memorial stele was inaugurated in Doune Cemetery, Girvan, to honour the 31 crew members of the French cargo ship Longwy, who were lost when the ship was torpedoed off the coast of Stranraer on 4 November 1917, during World War I. Among those remembered, two French sailors from the Longwy, Adolphe Harré and Samuel Brajeul, are buried in Doune Cemetery. The commemoration aimed to recognise the sacrifices made by the French crew members and strengthen Franco-Scottish ties.

==Transport==
Girvan railway station is served by ScotRail on the Glasgow Central to Stranraer line. All services call here, and several more start/terminate here.

Girvan is also served well by bus. Bus services are run by Stagecoach West Scotland, Shuttle Buses, and South Ayrshire Community Transport.

==Places of interest==
Knockcushan Gardens contains the old &#x27;Hill of Justice&#x27; stone and a plaque records that King Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick held a court here in 1328.

The McKechnie Institute was endowed by local businessmen Robert and Thomas McKechnie, was opened in 1889. The Institute plays host to regular displays and sales of local artists, offers tours and historical information about Girvan and the surrounding area. And is free to access when open.

Culzean Castle is about north of the town, and the volcanic island of Ailsa Craig is visible about offshore. Turnberry golf course and hotel are located north of Girvan. The coastline south of Girvan is famous for its geology, and also for the Sawney Bean Caves at Bennane Head or Balcreuchan Port, where the murderer and cannibal Sawney Bean supposedly lived until his arrest and execution in Edinburgh.

==Local festivals==

The Girvan Traditional Folk Festival takes place each year, on the Mayday holiday weekend. There were folk festivals held in the town from the mid 1960s however the Festival, in its current form, began proper in 1975. The Festival is one of Scotland&#x27;s longest-established gatherings of folk and traditional musicians and played a defining role in the Scottish Folk Revival – serving both as a significant annual celebration for traditional singers but also as a major session festival. Girvan&#x27;s long-standing folk club which played a foundational role in the early years of the Festival has recently been revitalised and re-christened as the Girvan Folk &amp; Music Club.

Girvan lifeboat harbour gala takes place each summer, usually in July, with music, stalls, fun fair, rescue displays and emergency services.

The Lowland Gathering takes place on the first Sunday of June each year in the Victory Park in the centre of the town.

The annual Festival of Light takes place in October with a six-week lantern project resulting in the river of light lantern procession and shorefront performance. The autumn lantern project is a celebration of the lanternmakers and the people of Carrick.

An additional new years event for families, involving lantern trails, lights and art aimed at families is run on new years Eve (Hogmanay), by Carrick Rural Arts.

==Education and community==

Girvan has its own secondary school, Girvan Academy, which the majority of local children attend. Roman Catholic families have the option of Queen Margaret Academy in Ayr. There are also two primary schools, Girvan Primary School (non-denominational) and Sacred Heart Primary School (denominational) and there is one non-denominational specialist school, Invergarven School.

The town&#x27;s swimming pool was closed in 2009 by South Ayrshire Council, on the grounds that it had reached the end of its operational life. The building has since been demolished. A new leisure centre, named &#x27;The Quay Zone&#x27; was officially opened on 26 April 2017. &#x27;The Quay Zone&#x27; was built in a way to help redevelop Girvan. It is sited on the old swimming pool&#x27;s location at the harbour.

==Religion==
The 2022 Scottish census found that 50% of Girvan&#x27;s population identified as having no religion, while 42% identified with Christian denominations and 1% other religions. 7% of Girvan&#x27;s population did not answer the optional question. 

=== Christian Churches ===
The Roman Catholic church in the town, &quot;Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary&quot;, built in 1860 in a plain gothic style. For many years the convent and the church were closely connected with Roman Catholic primary and secondary schools in Girvan. The secondary school closed in 1991.

Girvan has two Church of Scotland congregations: Girvan North Parish Church dating from 1883 in Montgomerie Street (with a spire over tall) and Girvan South Parish Church dating from 1839.

Milestone Christian Fellowship, a local congregation which began meeting in Girvan&#x27;s Community Centre in 2005, moved into a redeveloped nightclub on Bridge Street in 2016. Milestone is a member of the Baptist Union of Scotland.

The town&#x27;s Episcopalian congregation of St John was closed in 2014: they had been using the town&#x27;s Methodist church building for services after their building became unusable in 2009.

==Twin town==
Girvan is twinned with Torcy, Seine-et-Marne, France - in honour of a Scottish knight named Sir Thomas Huston originally from Girvan, who fought the English as part of the Auld Alliance during the Hundred Years War. Rewarding him for his bravery during the capture of Meaux in 1439, the King of France granted him the fiefdom of Torcy.

<text>Gourock ( ; ) is a town in the Inverclyde council area and formerly a burgh of the County of Renfrew in the west of Scotland. It was a seaside resort on the East shore of the upper Firth of Clyde. Its main function today is as a residential area, extending contiguously from Greenock, with a railway terminus and ferry services across the Clyde.

==History==

The name Gourock comes from a Gaelic word for &quot;pimple&quot;, in reference to the hill above the town. As far back as 1494 it is recorded that James IV sailed from the shore at Gourock to quell the rebellious Highland clans. Two hundred years later William and Mary granted a Charter in favour of Stewart of Castlemilk which raised Gourock to a Burgh of Barony. In 1784 the lands of Gourock were purchased by Duncan Darroch, a former merchant in Jamaica. He built Gourock House near the site of the castle in what the family eventually gifted to the town as Darroch Park, later renamed by the council as Gourock Park.

From a small fishing village in the traditional county of Renfrewshire, Gourock grew into a community involved in herring curing, copper mining, ropemaking, quarrying and latterly yacht-building and repairing. Within sight of Gourock, in the early hours of 21 October 1825, &quot;PS Comet (II)&quot; was run into by the steamer &quot;Ayr&quot;, some 62 people losing their lives.

When the competing railway companies extended their lines to provide fast connections to Clyde steamer services the &quot;Pierhead&quot; was built as a railway terminus. Nowadays a passenger ferry serves Kilcreggan and electric trains provide a service to Glasgow from Gourock railway station at the pierhead. The David MacBrayne Ltd headquarters is at the pier, and CalMac run a passenger ferry service to Dunoon. A car ferry service is run by Western Ferries from McInroy&#x27;s Point on the west side of the town to Hunter&#x27;s Quay to the north of Dunoon.

Like many Scottish seaside towns, Gourock&#x27;s tourist heyday was in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. Evidence of this part of its past is gradually disappearing - The Bay Hotel and Cragburn Pavilion and The Ashton, three local landmarks, disappeared towards the end of the last century. At the same time, Gourock has continued to expand along the coastline, with new estates above the medieval Castle Levan which has been restored and is in use as a bed and breakfast. Further development is taking place, though a short stretch of green belt still separates the town from the Cloch lighthouse which looks out over the firth to Innellan in Argyll.

==Places of interest==

Gourock has one of the three remaining public outdoor swimming pools in Scotland. Gourock Outdoor Pool was built in 1909 and reconstructed in 1969, it was once tidal and had a sandy floor, but is now a modern, heated facility, with cleaned sea water used in the saltwater pool. The pool was closed at the end of the 2010 summer season for a major improvement project, now completed. The existing changing accommodation was demolished and replaced with a more modern leisure centre, incorporating an enlarged gymnasium and lift access from the street level down to the new changing accommodation and the upgraded pool.

The megalithic Kempock Stone, popularly known as &quot;Granny Kempock Stone&quot;, stands on a cliff behind Kempock Street. The superstition was that for sailors going on a long voyage or a couple about to be married, walking seven times around the stone would ensure good fortune. A flight of steps winds up from the street past the stone to Castle Mansions and St John&#x27;s Church, whose crown steeple forms a landmark dominating Gourock.

Kempock Street is the main shopping street, and has a variety of shops including a small supermarket, art and gift shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs. At the north end of the street, a statue of a &quot;Girl on a Suitcase&quot; with bucket and spade at her side, popularly known as &quot;Wee Annie&quot;, commemorates the town&#x27;s past as a seaside resort and setting-off point. She looks out over the pier where Clyde steamers took holidaymakers &quot;doon the watter&quot;. The statue was created by Angela Hunter as part of a public art project commissioned by Riverside Inverclyde in 2011.

Gourock also has a golf course, which stretches from behind Trumpethill to Levan estates. The Municipal Buildings in Shore Street, which are now used as a business centre, were completed in 1924.

==Yacht club==
Gourock has a large yacht club named the Royal Gourock Yacht Club. Situated on Ashton Road at the junction of Victoria Road, it was known as Gourock Sailing Club when it was founded in 1894. It became Gourock Yacht Club in 1900, and acquired Royal status in 1908.

==Clan Darroch==
Clan Darroch&#x27;s links with Gourock began in the later half of the 18th century with Duncan Darroch, 1st of Gourock, who had returned to Scotland after making a fortune in the West Indies. There is a story that as a lad, before leaving for Jamaica, he climbed into the garden of Gourock House to get apples from the orchard, and when chased out by the gardener said he would return to buy the estate with its orchard. He acquired the Barony of Gourock from the Stewarts of Castlemilk in 1784. He was also granted arms by the Court of the Lord Lyon and designated Chief of McIireich.

The present head of the Scottish clan Darroch is titled Claire Darroch-Thompson, 8th of Gourock, Lady of the Barony of Gourock, following the death of her father, the late Duncan Darroch of Gourock on 1 February 2011.

==Industry==
Gourock&#x27;s principal industry, apart from tourism and fishing, was small craft repair and chandlery. An eponymous ropework opened in the town but later moved to Port Glasgow. More recently Amazon.com opened a distribution centre at Faulds Park, an industrial estate to the south of the town. The Amazon building was originally occupied by Mimtec who manufactured PC products in high volumes for IBM which closed in 2023.

==Geography ==
===Ashton===
The promenade at Ashton forms part of the Inverclyde Coastal Path.

===McInroy&#x27;s Point===

McInroy&#x27;s Point is a small peninsula to the west of the town. Around 1973, a pier was constructed here to form the departure point for Western Ferries. The port has since been expanded and now incorporates two floating ramps. The port is a terminus for the service to Hunters Quay, near Dunoon on the Cowal peninsula, on the western shore of the upper Firth of Clyde.



===Midton===
The area was the home of the Drumshantie Rifle Range in the late 19th century. It was developed in the mid-20th century as a series of prefabs (pre-fabricated houses) which were built on part of the &quot;Tower Hill&quot; as a temporary response to the post-war housing shortage.

===Trumpethill===

Trumpethill is a residential area situated between Midton and Levan and lies to the north of Gourock Golf Club, which stretches all the way behind to the back of Levan.
