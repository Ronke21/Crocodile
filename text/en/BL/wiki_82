<text>Inverurie (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Inbhir Uraidh&quot; or &quot;Inbhir Uaraidh&quot;, &#x27;mouth of the River Ury&#x27;) is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland at the confluence of the rivers Ury and Don, about north-west of Aberdeen.

==Geography==

Inverurie is in the strath of the River Don at the centre of Aberdeenshire and is known locally as the Heart of the Garioch. It sits between the River Don and the River Ury and is only from the imposing hill of Bennachie. The town centre is triangular and is dominated by Inverurie Town Hall built in 1863. In the middle of the &#x27;square&#x27; (as it is known locally) is the Inverurie and District War Memorial, capped by a lone Gordon Highlander looking out over the town. The main shopping areas include the Market Place and West High Street which branches off from the centre towards the more residential part of the town. South of the River Don is the village of Port Elphinstone, which is part of the Royal Burgh of Inverurie and is so called due to the proximity of the former Aberdeenshire Canal which ran from Inverurie to Aberdeen.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Inverurie&quot; comes from the Scottish Gaelic meaning &#x27;confluence of the Ury&#x27; after the river which joins the Don just south of the town. In the 19th century, with the increased use of the postal service, many letters addressed to &quot;Inverury&quot; were being sent to &quot;Inverary&quot; in Argyll, on the west coast of Scotland. The town council ordained that the name to be used for council business should be &quot;Inverurie&quot; which they also regarded as being the &quot;ancient spelling&quot;. They asked the public to use this spelling in future and said that the Postmaster General had accepted the change. The town clerk made the official announcement on 20 April 1866.

== Prehistory ==
Excavations by archaeologists in the summer of 2018 at the Thainstone Business Park, discovered the remains of: a Scottish Middle Bronze Age (1550–1150 BC) roundhouse and a urned cremation cemetery; Scottish Late Bronze Age (1150–800 BC) cremation practices; and an Iron Age roundhouse and souterrain from the 1st/2nd century AD, indicating human occupation in the area for thousands of years. An excavation in 2002 uncovered the remains of another Iron Age roundhouse.

==History==

The Bass of Inverurie is said to have been founded by David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of Malcolm IV, in the late 12th century. The religious foundation pre-dates this by five centuries with the establishment of the Kirk of Inverurie now known as St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church. However, the town&#x27;s earliest known charter dates from 1558, with its modern development taking place after the building of the Aberdeenshire Canal linking Port Elphinstone with Aberdeen Harbour in 1806.

On a nearby hillside the Easter Aquhorthies stone circle dates back to the 3rd millennium BC. On the outskirts of the town the Brandsbutt Stone is a class I Pictish symbol stone with an ogham inscription.

There have been three well known battles in the town: The Battle of Inverurie (1308), the Battle of Harlaw (1411) between Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles (MacDonald) and an army commanded by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar; and the Battle of Inverurie during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

The House of Aquahorthies is at Burnhervie on the edge of Inverurie, built around 1797. The house served as a clandestine major seminary until after Catholic Emancipation in 1829, and since then it has been a private family home.

During the Second World War, Luftwaffe planes would have been seen several times, due to the Blitz against the nearby city of Aberdeen but Inverurie itself was not bombed.

The Inverurie Locomotive Works, which closed in 1969, led to a modest increase in size and prosperity, but much of the growth came from the &quot;Oil boom&quot; in 1970s.

==Twinning==
Inverurie, Scotland, was officially twinned with the French town Bagnères-de-Bigorre on 15 October 2016. This partnership fosters cultural exchanges, particularly through educational initiatives like those involving Inverurie Academy. The connection has seen visits from French students, including a notable visit in 2017, where students engaged in various cultural activities, culminating in a ceilidh that celebrated Scottish and French traditions. These exchanges encourage language learning and community bonding between the two towns. 

Fiona Peebles was a key figure in the twinning relationship between Inverurie, Scotland, and Bagnères-de-Bigorre, France. She was instrumental in fostering cultural exchanges, and was involved in initiatives such as student exchanges and community events. Both towns mourned her death in 2023, as she had had a lasting impact on their twinning partnership.

* Bagnères-de-Bigorre (France) since 2016.

==Industry==
Inverurie is a market town, now with a monthly Farmer&#x27;s Market, with many small shops, businesses and services. Its main industries other than service and commerce are agriculture, oil and, until International Paper closed the mill at Thainstone in March 2009, paper manufacture. The Great North of Scotland Railway constructed its locomotive construction and repair works on a site at Inverurie. Coombes, a small sweet shop, was famed as being the oldest family-owned business in Scotland until the death of Colin Coombes in 1957 whereupon the business closed. The bakery chain JG Ross is headquartered in the town.

Agriculture continues to be a mainstay of Inverurie&#x27;s economy, as it has done since the town&#x27;s inception. The Thainstone Centre, to the south east of the town, is a large livestock market, which rents out commercial units to various agricultural support services, oil industry storage yards and vehicle hire companies.

A retail park opened in June 2009.

The town is served by Inverurie Hospital.

==Language==
Some Inverurie natives speak the Aberdeenshire Doric dialect of Scots, as well as Scottish English.
The council&#x27;s 2016 population survey estimated a population of 13,480 of which 90.0% spoke primarily English at home, 4.9% Scots and 1.5% Polish. However, 51% of residents reported being proficient in the Scots language.

Historically, Pictish is the ancient language of the area, which can be found in many place names. It appears to have been a Brythonic language, but its classification remains uncertain. Pictish was eventually replaced by Scottish Gaelic in the area, and evidence of the language is found both in words in the Doric and in place names, such as Inverurie itself. The Book of Deer originates from the village of Old Deer, a few miles to the north east.

==Religion==
The oldest church in Inverurie is St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church, part of The Church of Scotland which was founded as the &quot;Kirk of Rocharl&quot; by the Culdee monks in the 9th century.

==Sports==
Inverurie Loco Works F.C., who play their matches at Harlaw Park, are the local Highland League football team.

Inverurie Boxing Club, an amateur boxing club located in Kintore. The club was started in 2017 and has since then acquired its own premises and has had multiple Scottish novice and district champions

Colony Park F.C. are the town&#x27;s juvenile team, founded by Dod Reid MBE in 1978.

Garioch RFC, based at Kellands Park, play Rugby Union.

==Notable residents==
* Hannah Miley, athlete, represented Scotland at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.
* Peter Nicol, former world squash number one, born in Inverurie.
* Barry Robson, Aberdeen former midfielder and current manager, born in Inverurie.
* Callum Smith – Double Olympian in cross country skiing, who competed at both the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics attended both Kellands Primary School and Inverurie Academy.

==Transport==
Inverurie has an hourly internal bus service as well as some out of town services, including to Aberdeen – most (but not all) are provided by Stagecoach Bluebird. The town lies on the A96 road and is served by Inverurie railway station on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line. The nearest airport is Aberdeen Airport at Dyce. Port Elphinstone railway station was a freight depot in Port Elphinstone; it is now disused.

A bypass opened on 7 December 1990 and the A96 was rerouted to use the new road.

==Education==
Inverurie Academy is the main secondary school in the town.

<text>Inverkeithing ( ; ) is a coastal town, parish and historic Royal burgh in Fife, Scotland. The town lies on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, 9.5 miles northwest of Edinburgh city centre and 4 miles south of Dunfermline. 

A town of ancient origin, Inverkeithing became an important centre of trade and pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. Inverkeithing was granted Royal burgh status by 1161 and became the host of the annual Convention of Royal Burghs from 1487. The town witnessed the Battle of Inverkeithing in 1651, a conflict in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Following the Industrial Revolution, Inverkeithing developed industries in distilling, ship breaking and quarrying.

Inverkeithing town centre is a conservation area, home to 41 listed historic buildings including the best-preserved medieval friary in Scotland and one of the finest examples of a medieval Mercat Cross. Inverkeithing features on the Fife Coastal Path, one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails, and the Fife Pilgrim Way.

Inverkeithing railway station is a main stop for trains running over the nearby Forth Rail Bridge, and the town is home to the Ferrytoll Park &amp; Ride. Around half of Inverkeithing&#x27;s workers work in Edinburgh city centre or Dunfermline (2024). The town has a population of 4,820 (2020) and the civil parish has a population of 8,878 (2022).
==Toponymy==
The name is of Scottish Gaelic origin, &quot;Inbhir Céitein&quot;. &quot;Inbhir&quot; is a common element in place names with Celtic roots and means &quot;confluence, inflow&quot; (see Aber and Inver), thus &quot;mouth of the Keithing/Céitein&quot;. The Keithing is the name of a small river or burn that runs through the southern part of the town. Simon Taylor notes that the name Keithing probably contains the Pictish (Brythonic) *&quot;coet&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;, so the Keithing burn would have meant &quot;stream that runs through or past or issues from woodland&quot;. William Watson in 1910 hypothesised an etymological link between the hydronym &quot;Keithing&quot; and the Welsh &quot;cethin&quot;, &quot;dusky&quot; (c.f. Bryncethin).

==Geography==
=== Townscape ===
Inverkeithing lies on the north shore of the Firth of Forth at its narrowest crossing point, about 2.5 miles from South Queensferry, from Edinburgh city centre and from Edinburgh Airport. The nearest city is Dunfermline, northwest.

Topographically, Inverkeithing is situated on a raised terrace sloping down towards Inverkeithing Bay, which cuts in to the south of the town, separating it from the North Queensferry peninsula. There are views from the town centre across the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh, Arthur&#x27;s Seat, and the Pentland Hills.

The town is bounded to the south by the North Queensferry peninsula and to the east by Inverkeithing Bay and Letham Hill. Its medieval centre lay along High Street and Church Street, but the town has since expanded to encompass areas to the north, east, and west. Modern Inverkeithing is almost contiguous with the neighbouring settlements of North Queensferry, Rosyth and Hillend village, and Dalgety Bay.

The Keithing Burn flows from forest plantations to the northeast of the town between Dalgety Bay and Aberdour, past the railway junction, before falling into the Inner Bay of Inverkeithing Bay south of the town centre.

=== Landscape ===
Inverkeithing lies on the Fife Coastal Path, a long-distance footpath designated as one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails. Coming from North Queensferry, the path winds around the Inner Bay, through Inverkeithing proper, and past the Ballast Bank public park towards Dalgety Bay. The Fife Pilgrim Way also passes through Inverkeithing.
Rising from the Inverkeithing stretch of Fife Coastal Path is Letham Hill Wood, a strip of broadleaved woodland 1.5km long, forming a hilly barrier between Inverkeithing and Dalgety Bay popular with walkers and mountain bikers. The approach to the hill passes Prestonhill Quarry, which has high cliffs of igneous and metamorphic rock and native species of fish in the resulting quarry water pools.

Inverkeithing has two sandy beaches: Inverkeithing Bay Beach located off the Fife Coastal Path, and another located on the south shore of Inverkeithing&#x27;s inner bay. Inverkeithing Bay Beach has a mean tidal range of approximately 4.9 meters.
=== Climate ===
Inverkeithing follows a typical East Scotland temperate maritime climate.

==History==

=== Roman period ===
Inverkeithing has ancient origins: there is some evidence that during the Roman conquest of Britain, Roman governor Agricola established an encampment in the area between AD 78–87 during his war against the Caledonians. By AD 142, when construction on the Antonine Wall began on the southern shores of the River Forth, it is likely any Roman settlement ended.

=== Medieval period ===
The town&#x27;s early history is tied to the founding of a church by a holy man named St Erat, supposedly a follower of St Ninian. Local tradition (recorded in a plaque on the parish church) holds that St Erat founded a church in Inverkeithing in the 5th century, but he might be identical to a &quot;St Theriot&quot; venerated in nearby Fordell, who is thought to have lived in the 8th century. Because the first written references to St Erat come from the 16th century, they do not provide hard evidence for Inverkeithing&#x27;s early history, or even for the existence of the saint.

Inverkeithing is first documented in 1114, when it is mentioned in the foundation charter of Scone Abbey granted by King Alexander I. In 1163 it appears—as &quot;Innirkeithin&quot;—in Pope Alexander III&#x27;s summons of the clergy of the British Isles to the Council of Tours. Inverkeithing was made one of Fife&#x27;s first royal burghs—which brought with it legal and trading privileges—in the 12th century. While the precise date is unknown, its burgh status may have been bestowed during the reign of David I, and it is mentioned as an existing burgh as early as 1161 by Malcolm IV. The settlement was an obvious choice to be created a burgh, as its location at the narrowest crossing point of the Firth of Forth and its sheltered bay were both strategically important.

One of the earliest accounts of life in Inverkeithing comes from the 14th-century &quot;Lanercost Chronicle&quot;. At Easter 1282, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; relates, the parish priest of Inverkeithing had &quot;revived the profane rites of Priapus, collecting young girls from the villages, and compelling them to dance in circles to the honour of Father Bacchus, [...] singing and dancing himself and stirring them to lust by filthy language.&quot; When the priest exhibited similar behaviour during Lent, a scandalised citizen stabbed him to death. The incident was used by influential archaeologist and folklorist Margaret Murray in her 1931 book &quot;The God of the Witches&quot; as support for her (now mostly discredited) hypothesis of the survival of British paganism into the Middle Ages.
The town was the last place that King Alexander III was seen before he died on 19 March 1286. The King had crossed the Forth from Dalmeny in a storm to pay a birthday visit to Queen Yolande, who was staying in Kinghorn. On arriving in Inverkeithing, the party was met by one of the burgesses of the town, Alexander Le Saucier (whose name indicates he was either linked to the King&#x27;s kitchen, or the master of the local saltpans), who tried to convince the King to stay the night. However, the pleas fell on deaf ears, and Alexander set off into the rainy night with two local guides. The group lost its way near Kinghorn and got separated from the King, who was found dead at the bottom of a steep embankment on the next day, having presumably fallen from his horse.

Edward I (&quot;Longshanks&quot;) stayed in Inverkeithing on 2 March 1304 on his return to Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence. This is evidenced by letters written here as he made his way from Dunfermline to St Andrews. All the 14th century Scottish monarchs had a connection with Inverkeithing.

Roger de Mowbray, baron of Inverkeithing, sealed the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 and was later sentenced to death for treason against King Robert I.

Throughout much of the Middle Ages, Inverkeithing was an important resting place and staging post for pilgrims. Travelers on their way to the shrines of Saint Margaret in Dunfermline and Saint Andrew in St Andrews would often stop in the town after crossing the Firth of Forth via the Queen&#x27;s Ferry. A hostel for pilgrims in Inverkeithing is documented as a possession of Dryburgh Abbey as early as 1196. A Franciscan friary was established in Inverkeithing in the mid-14th century, which was also intended to serve religious travelers. It is one of the few remnants of a house of the Greyfriars to have survived in Scotland. Due to Inverkeithing&#x27;s importance for medieval pilgrims, it is one of the towns along the Fife Pilgrim Way established in 2019.

In 1487, an Act of Parliament during the reign of James III specified that the Convention of Royal Burghs would be held annually in Inverkeithing. Evolving in parallel to the Parliament of Scotland, the Convention was an important representative assembly of trading towns. While the Act specified Inverkeithing as the host, it is unclear how many meetings were held there before the Convention moved to Edinburgh in 1552.

=== Post-medieval period ===

==== 16th century ====
In November 1504 there was a plague scare at Dunfermline Palace, and four African women including Ellen More, with John Mosman, the court apothecary, came to stay in Inverkeithing before crossing to South Queensferry.

Inverkeithing was one of the few Scottish burghs to have four stone gates—known as &quot;ports&quot;—around its medieval settlement. Stone walls were added in 1557, the last remains of which can still be found on the south side of Roman Road. Until that time, Inverkeithing enjoyed a successful trade in wool, fleece and hides, and served as a hub of commerce for Fife. The town&#x27;s flourishing was evidenced by its weekly markets and five annual fairs.

==== 17th century ====
However, trade had begun to decrease by the 16th century, and Inverkeithing slowly became poorer than its neighbouring settlements. Due to political and social instability, caused by both plague and war, this downward trend continued in the 17th century. In 1654, Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu mentions Inverkeithing as &quot;formerly a flourishing market&quot; in his &quot;Nova Fifae Descriptio&quot;.

Inverkeithing was a hotbed for witch trials in the 17th century. In 1621 six local women were tried for witchcraft in the Tolbooth. Between 1621 and 1652, at least 51 people were executed for witchcraft in Inverkeithing, an unusually large number for a town of this size; the much larger Kirkcaldy only saw 18 executions in the same period. The reason is believed to be a combination of cholera outbreaks, famine, and the appointment of Rev. Walter Bruce—a known witch hunter—as minister of St Peter&#x27;s. Bruce also played a pivotal role in initiating the so-called Great Scottish witch hunt of 1649–50. The executions were carried out at &quot;Witch Knowe&quot; to the south of town, which today is partially within Hope Street Cemetery.
On 20 July 1651, the Battle of Inverkeithing was fought on two sites in the area, one north of the town close to Pitreavie Castle, the other to the south on and around the peninsula of North Queensferry and the isthmus connecting it to Inverkeithing. The battle took place during Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s invasion of the Kingdom of Scotland following the Third English Civil War. It was an attempt by the English Parliamentarian forces to outflank the army of Scottish Covenanters loyal to Charles II at Stirling and get access to the north of Scotland. This was the last major engagement of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and led to Scotland passing into Cromwell&#x27;s control. Cromwell&#x27;s 4,500 troops defeated a Scottish force of roughly equal size, forcing the Covenanters to abandon Stirling and march south to support Charles II. Of the estimated 800 MacLean clansmen who fought in the battle, only 35 were said to have survived, although Covenanter officer Sir James Balfour estimated the clan&#x27;s losses at around 100. An apocryphal account states that the Pinkerton Burn ran red with blood for three days afterwards. This was a significant episode in the history of Clan MacLean, and the 20th century poet Sorley MacLean mentions Inverkeithing in one of his poems.

==== 18th century ====
In 1703 the title of Viscount of Inverkeithing fell to the Earl of Roseberry. In 1707, James Spittle representing Inverkeithing voted in favour of ratification of the Treaty of Union (see Act of Union).

Daniel Defoe, writing of Inverkeithing in his &quot;Tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot; in 1724, found the town to be &quot;still populous, but decayed, as to what it has formerly been&quot;. Defoe also relates that Inverkeithing had briefly become known in England in the early 1700s for a crime of passion in which Robert Balfour, 5th Lord Balfour of Burleigh, murdered an Inverkeithing schoolmaster who had married a woman Balfour loved—the nobleman was later sentenced to death, but escaped captivity by exchanging clothes with his sister.

Defoe&#x27;s sentiments about Inverkeithing were echoed by Sir William Burrell when he toured Scotland in 1758, who found it a &quot;mean, miserable, paultry town, teaching us what to expect from its neighbouring villages&quot;. At the time, the parish had a population of over 2,200, and industry had become both smaller in scale and more diverse. Lead and coal were mined, with coal being exported in substantial quantities. There was an iron foundry and, by the late 18th century, the town had a brewery, tan works, soap works, a salt pan and timber works. A whisky distillery, using the water of Keithing Burn, was opened in 1795, and operated until the mid-19th century. Its buildings, near the railway line in Keith Place, were later used for oil works. The importance of fishing declined in line with increasing industrialisation and, by 1891, Inverkeithing only had 14 resident fishermen. 

==== 19th century ====
In 1821, merchant and politician Sir Robert Preston directed the development of Preston Crescent, a new road to the south of the town on the banks of the Inner Bay. Alongside a small stone bridge (today a C-listed building), a number of plain classical houses were built to accommodate retired sea captains, with most of the buildings surviving to this day. Nearby Preston Hill is also named for Sir Robert, who erected a flagpole there intended to aid marine traffic.

By the mid-19th century quarrying, engineering and shipbuilding were major industries in the area and, in 1831, the population increased by over 600 in a decade, due to an influx of labourers employed in greenstone quarries. The quarries provided material for major works, such as the extension of Leith Pier and some of the piers of the Forth Bridge. By 1870, engineering and shipbuilding had largely ceased, and the harbour lost freight traffic to the railways. As a result, Inverkeithing was no longer on a through route for freight. The opening of the Forth Bridge in 1890, however, led to another surge in population and new building. By 1925, quarrying remained a major operation and, whilst the saltworks, iron foundry and sawmill had closed, a papermaking industry had developed at the harbour. Caldwell&#x27;s paper mill would remain in operation until 2003, with the factory being demolished in 2012.

==== 20th century onwards ====
In 1901 Inverkeithing Bowling Club was founded, and in 1908 Inverkeithing United Football Club was founded.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Inverkeithing became known for its shipbreaking at Thos. W. Ward&#x27;s yard on the Inner Bay. Among others, the revolutionary battleship HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was dismantled there in 1923, as was the hull of the &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s sister ship RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; in 1937, the Nazi Party cruise ship &quot;Robert Ley&quot; in 1947, passenger steamer and later depot ship HMS Montclare in 1958, and the second RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; in 1966. Today, the yard is a metal recycling facility.

Caldwell’s Paper Mill was a significant employer in the town throughout the 20th century.

All Royal Burghs were disbanded in 1975, ending the autonomy Inverkeithing had enjoyed since the 11th century. Inverkeithing became part of Fife Council.

==Places of interest==

=== Historic landmarks ===
Inverkeithing is home to 55 listed buildings, including 6 of category A; the highest possible level of classification for &quot;buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic; or fine, little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type&quot;. The heart of the medieval town was located around High Street, Bank Street, Townhall Street, and Church Street.

==== St. Peter&#x27;s Church ====
The B-listed parish church of St. Peter stands in its large churchyard on the east side of Church Street. The church was founded by Waltheof of Allerdale, son of Gospatrick, as a wooden Celtic church before being adapted into a Norman stone structure, which was bequeathed by the monks of Dunfermline Abbey in 1139. The Norman foundations were reused for the 13th century Gothic structure, and a tower was added in the 14th century. In pre-Reformation times the church had altars to St. Michael, the Holy Blood, John the Baptist, St. Catherine, the Holy Rood, St. Laurence, St. Ninian and St. Mary. In 1611 it absorbed the adjacent parish of Rosyth.

Extensive fire damage in 1825 reduced it to the height of its lower window sills, although the tower survived, but it was rebuilt. The main part of the church is thus a large plain neo-Gothic &#x27;preaching box&#x27; of 1826–27, designed by James Gillespie Graham. Built of soft sandstone, the tower—the only remaining part of the pre-Reformation church—is very weathered, and has been partially refaced. The tower is crowned by a lead-covered spire from 1835 designed by Thomas Bonnar, whose elaborate gabled dormers saw clock faces being added in 1883.

The church&#x27;s roomy interior—now deprived of its galleries—is graced by one of the finest medieval furnishings to survive in any Scottish parish church. This is the large and well-preserved sandstone font of around 1398, which was rediscovered buried under the church, having been concealed at the Reformation. Its octagonal bowl is decorated with angels holding heraldic shields. These include the royal arms of the King of Scots, and of Queen Anabella Drummond, the consort of King Robert III. The high quality of the carving is explained by it being a royal gift to the parish church, Inverkeithing being a favourite residence of Queen Anabella. Most of the interior visible today was designed by Peter MacGregor Chalmers and dates from 1900. Notable ministers include Robert Roche (Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1613) and witch hunter Walter Bruce, who served the unique church role of &#x27;Constant Moderator&#x27; from 1662 until 1673.

==== Hospitium of the Grey Friars ====

On the High Street lies one of the best surviving examples of a friary building in Scotland, the category-A listed Hospitium of the Grey Friars (also known as the Franciscan order). The friary could date from the late 13th century, with a charter in 1268 mentioning the building of a church and convent for the Franciscans. It may have been founded by Philip Mowbray, Lord of Barnbougle on the opposite shore of the Forth. There are no further mentions of the friary until 1384, but at the time, it would have been a thriving hub for pilgrims to Dunfermline and St Andrews, comprising accommodations, cloisters, storage cellars, and a chapel. The friary was sold to a private buyer in 1559 during the Scottish Reformation and remodeled into a tenement.

The hospitium visible today once formed the west end of the friary, and it was the only building preserved during the 16th-century alterations, while the rest of the complex was used as a quarry. An antiquarian renovation in 1932–1935 restored the 14th-century details for which there was evidence, and otherwise retained the 17th-century finishes. The building was originally cruciform, but only its central part remains, including several tunnel vaults formerly used for storage. The foundations of the north range of the complex, together with a well and several cellars, can be seen in the public gardens next to the hospitium. The building is now mainly used as a community centre.

==== Inverkeithing Mercat Cross ====

Inverkeithing contains one of the oldest and finest remaining examples of a mercat cross in Scotland, dating from 1389. The cross, a category-A listed historic monument, is believed to have been built as a memorial of the marriage between the Duke of Rothesay and the daughter of the Earl of Douglas. Originally, the cross stood on the north end of the High Street, before moving to face the Tolbooth and then to its present site at the junction between Bank Street and High Street, further up the road. As of 2021, there are plans to move it to a more prominent position in the Market Square, as part of a £3.6 million, five-year programme of improvements to the town centre. The core of the mercat cross is thought to date from the late 14th century, with the octagonal shaft from the 16th century. Two of the shields on the cross bear the arms of Queen Anabella Drummond and the Douglas family. Later, a unicorn and a shield depicting the St Andrew&#x27;s Cross were added in 1688, the work of John Boyd of South Queensferry.

==== Inverkeithing Town House ====
On Townhall Street is the A-listed Inverkeithing Town House (also known as the Tolbooth), which displays the old town coat of arms above the front door. The Renaissance tower, at the western end of the building, is the oldest part of the tolbooth, dating from 1755. A three-storey classical building followed in 1770 as a replacement for the previous tolbooth. The building featured a prison or &#x27;black hole&#x27; on the ground floor, the court room on the middle and the debtors&#x27; prison on the top. The building was fully renovated and remodeled for community use from 2022 to 2024.

==== Other historic landmarks ====

The Burgh Arms Hotel and Pub dates to 1664 with an extension from 1888, making it one of the oldest pubs in East Scotland. The pub is a category-C listed historic building and is still in operation.

Fordell&#x27;s Lodging is opposite St Peter&#x27;s Church and is an A-listed L-plan tower house which dates from 1671 and was built by Sir John Henderson of Fordell. On King Street is the much altered B-listed &quot;Rosebery House&quot;, once owned by the Rosebery family, and possibly the oldest surviving house in the burgh. The unusual monopitch lean-to roof is locally known as a &#x27;toofall&#x27;, and dates the house to no later than the early 16th century. It was owned by the Earl of Dunbar before being purchased by the Earl of Rosebery.

Inverkeithing Harbour is a historic B-Listed narrow rubble-built harbour at the point where Keithing Burn debouches into Inverkeithing Bay. The harbour was first recorded in 1587, and was a probable landing place for the Queensferry passage during the 12th century. It was the terminus of the 18th century Halbeath Waggon Way. The Keithing Burn enters the head of harbour through square bull-faced rubble sluice installed in 1840, over which runs a 20th century metal footbridge.
Inverkeithing Railway Station dates from 1877, and was significantly expanded in 1890 as a dual track railway following the completion of the nearby Forth Rail Bridge. The East Block is original, and now forms a large waiting block, and is category B listed by Historic Scotland. Part of the Railway&#x27;s infrastructure includes tunnelling under Boreland Road Bridge at the immediate south exit from the station, built in the late 18th century to span over the river Keithing for the original Halbeath Waggon Railway (now category-B listed). The Waggon Way, opened in 1783, is now used as a footpath.

Moffat Cottage on Heriot Street was the home of missionary Robert Moffat, father-in-law of Victorian explorer David Livingstone. Information from local sources and a commemorative plaque indicate that Livingstone occasionally stayed at the cottage, including after his first return to Britain during 1856/57; he also may have built the summerhouse. Today the cottage is a category-C Listed building. 

St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church, dated 1908, is a classic example of Edwardian church design, built to accommodate the growing number of episcopal residents following the church&#x27;s re-establishment in Edinburgh in 1878. The church lies at the southern end of the town, and is a category-C listed historic building.

Thomsoun&#x27;s House is located on Bank Street, between numbers 2–4, dates from 1617, and was reconstructed in 1965. Its carved sandstone pediment includes thistle-shaped finials and the initials of the first owners John Thomson (&quot;I.T.&quot;) and Bessie Thomsoun (&quot;B.T.&quot;).

<text>The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (abbreviated as CPI(M)) is a communist political party in India. It is the largest communist party in India in terms of membership and electoral seats, and one of the six national parties of India. The party was founded through a splitting from the [[Communist Party of India]] in 1964 and it quickly became the dominant faction.

The 34 years of CPI(M) led Left Front rule in West Bengal was the longest-serving democratically elected communist-led government in the world. It has been also the third largest party of parliament several times. Presently, CPI(M) is a part of ruling alliances in two states - the LDF in Kerala, which it leads, and the SPA in Tamil Nadu. It also has representation in the legislative assemblies of seven states.

The All-India Party Congress is the supreme authority of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). However, during the time between two party congresses, the Central Committee is the highest decision-making body. The Central Committee shall elect from among its members a Polit Bureau including the General Secretary. The Polit Bureau carries on the work of the Central Committee between its two sessions and has the right to take political and organisational decisions in between two meetings of the Central Committee.

CPI(M) had a total income of ₹1,620,000,000 in fiscal year 2021–22. The party reported zero funding from Electoral Bonds.

== Name ==
CPI(M) is officially known as [] in Hindi, but it is often known as (, abbreviated &quot;MaKaPa&quot;) in press and media circles. During its initial years after the split, the party was often referred to by different names such as &#x27;Left Communist Party&#x27; or &#x27;Communist Party of India (Left)&#x27;. The party has used the name &#x27;Left&#x27; because CPI people were dubbed &#x27;rightist&#x27; in nature for their support of the Congress-Nehru regime. During the Kerala Legislative Assembly elections of 1965, the party adopted the name &#x27;Communist Party of India (Marxist)&#x27; and applied to obtain its election symbol from the Election Commission of India.

== Background ==


The Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged from a division within the Communist Party of India. The CPI had experienced an upsurge in support during the years following the World War II, and had led armed rebellions in Telangana, Tripura, and Kerala. However, it soon abandoned the strategy of armed revolution in favor of working within the Parliament framework. In 1950, B. T. Ranadive, the CPI general secretary and a prominent representative of the radical sector inside the party, was demoted on grounds of left-adventurism.

Under the government of the Indian National Congress party of Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India developed close relations and a strategic partnership with the Soviet Union. The Soviet government consequently wished that the Indian communists moderate their criticism towards the Indian state and assume a supportive role towards the Congress governments. However, large sections of the CPI claimed that India remained a semi-feudal country and that Class conflict could not be put on the back-burner for the sake of guarding the interests of Soviet trade and foreign policy. Moreover, the Indian National Congress appeared to be generally hostile towards political competition. In 1959 the central government intervened to impose President&#x27;s rule in Kerala, toppling the E. M. S. Namboodiripad cabinet (the sole non-Congress state government in the country).

== History ==

=== Formation (1964) ===
The basis of difference in opinion between the two factions in CPI was ideological – about the assessment of the Indian scenario and the development of a party programme. This difference in opinion was also a reflection of whether the Communist Party in India would toe the lines of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) or follow an independent path based on the concrete analysis of the Indian situation. The alleged &#x27;right-wing&#x27; inside the party followed the Soviet path whereas the &#x27;left-wing&#x27; wanted to follow the mass party with a class line with national characteristics, based on the &#x27;independent&#x27; development of socialism in accordance to the India situation. Moreover, the faction of CPI which later became CPI(M) referred to the &quot;right&quot; strategy as a national approach of class collaboration, a damning charge within the communist movement, in which the prioritization of working-class interests and independence is considered paramount. Ideological difference also grew on the analysis of the role and character of the Indian bourgeoisie and the character of the Indian revolution. While the &#x27;right wing&#x27; in the Party sought the Indian bourgeoisie to have a &#x27;progressive&#x27; character and called for a national democratic revolution, the &#x27;left wing&#x27; sought the character of the Indian bourgeoisie to be essentially reactionary and called for a peoples&#x27; democratic revolution. However as the &#x27;left wing&#x27; grew, the Congress and the Party&#x27;s &#x27;right wing&#x27; dubbed them as pro-Chinese and essentially made extensive efforts to incriminate them of committing &#x27;anti-national&#x27; activities. This ideological difference later intensified, and ultimately gave rise to the establishment of CPI(M).

Hundreds of CPI leaders, accused of being pro-Chinese, were imprisoned. Thousands of Communists were detained without trial.
The Communist Party CPI(M) has a strong history of championing labor rights and it supports the rights of industrial laborers, demanding fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to unionize.

In 1962, Ajoy Ghosh, the General Secretary of the CPI died. After his death, Shripad Amrit Dange was installed as the party chairman (a new position) and E.M.S. Namboodiripad as general secretary. This was an attempt to achieve a compromise.

At a CPI National Council meeting held on 11 April 1964, 32 Council members walked out.

The leftist section, to which the 32 National Council members belonged, organized a convention in Tenali, Andhra Pradesh 7 to 11 July. In this convention, the issues of the internal disputes in the party were discussed. 146 delegates, claiming to represent 100,000 CPI members, took part in the proceedings. The convention decided to convene the 7th Party Congress of CPI in Kolkata later the same year.

Marking a difference from the official sector of CPI, the Tenali convention was marked by the display of a large portrait of the Communist leader of China, Mao Zedong.

At the Tenali convention, a Bengal-based pro-Chinese group, representing one of the most radical streams of the CPI left-wing, presented a draft program proposal of their own. These radicals criticized the draft program proposal prepared by Makineni Basavapunnaiah for undermining Class conflict and failing to take a clear pro-Chinese position in the ideological conflict between the CPSU and the CPC.

After the Tenali convention, the CPI left-wing organized party district and state conferences. In West Bengal, a few of these meetings became battlegrounds between the most radical elements and the more moderate leadership. At the Calcutta Party District Conference, an alternative draft program was presented to the leadership by Parimal Das Gupta (a leading figure amongst far-left intellectuals in the party). Another alternative proposal was brought forward to the Calcutta Party District Conference by Aziz ul Haq, but Haq was initially banned from presenting it by the conference organizers. At the Calcutta Party District Conference, 42 delegates opposed M. Basavapunniah&#x27;s official draft program proposal.

At the Siliguri Party District Conference, the main draft proposal for a party program was accepted, but with some additional points suggested by the far-left North Bengal cadre Charu Majumdar. However, Hare Krishna Konar (representing the leadership of the CPI left-wing) forbade the raising of the slogan &quot;Mao Tse-Tung Zindabad&quot; (Long live Mao Tse-Tung) at the conference.

Parimal Das Gupta&#x27;s document was also presented to the leadership at the West Bengal State Conference of the CPI leftwing. Das Gupta and a few others spoke at the conference, demanding the party ought to adopt the class analysis of the Indian state of the 1951 CPI conference. His proposal was, however, voted down.

The Calcutta Congress was held between 31 October and 7 November, at Tyagraja Hall in southern Kolkata. Simultaneously, the CPI convened a Party Congress in Mumbai. The group which assembled in Calcutta would later adopt the name &#x27;Communist Party of India (Marxist)&#x27;, to differentiate themselves from the CPI. The CPI(M) also adopted its own political program. Puchalapalli Sundarayya was elected general secretary of the party.

In total, 422 delegates took part in the Calcutta Congress. CPI(M) claimed that they represented 104,421 CPI members, 60% of the total party membership.

At the Calcutta conference, the party adopted a class analysis of the character of the Indian state, that claimed the Indian bourgeoisie was increasingly collaborating with imperialism.

Parimal Das Gupta&#x27;s alternative draft program was not circulated at the Calcutta conference. However, Souren Bose, a delegate from the far-left stronghold Darjeeling, spoke at the conference asking why no portrait had been raised of Mao Tse-Tung along with the portraits of other communist stalwarts. His intervention was met with huge applause from conference delegates.
 
=== Early years (1964–1966) ===
The CPI (M) was born into a hostile political climate. At the time of the holding of its Calcutta Congress, large sections of its leaders and cadres were jailed without trial. Again on 29–30 December, over a thousand CPI (M) cadres were arrested and detained and held in jail without trial. In 1965 new waves of arrests of CPI(M) cadres took place in West Bengal, as the party launched agitations against the rise in fares in the Calcutta Tramways Company and against the then-prevailing food crisis. Statewide general strikes and hartals were observed on 5 August 1965, 10–11 March 1966, and 6 April 1966. The March 1966 general strike resulted in several deaths during confrontations with police forces.

Also in Kerala, mass arrests of CPI(M) cadres were carried out during 1965. In Bihar, the party called for a &quot;Bandh&quot; (general strike) in Patna on 9 August 1965 in protest against the Congress state government. During the strike, police resorted to violent actions against the organizers of the strike. The strike was followed by agitations in other parts of the state.

P. Sundaraiah, after being released from jail, spent the period of September 1965 – February 1966 in Moscow for medical treatment. In Moscow, he also held talks with the CPSU.

The Central Committee of CPI(M) held its first meeting on 12–19 June 1966. The reason for delaying the holding of a regular CC meeting was that several of the persons elected as CC members at the Calcutta Congress were jailed at the time. A CC meeting had been scheduled to have been held in Thrissur during the last days of 1964, but had been canceled due to the wave of arrests against the party. The meeting discussed tactics for electoral alliances and concluded that the party should seek to form a broad electoral alliance with all non-reactionary opposition parties in West Bengal (i.e. all parties except Bharatiya Jana Sangh and Swatantra Party). This decision was strongly criticized by the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Party of Labour of Albania, the Communist Party of New Zealand, and the radicals within the party itself. The line was changed at a National Council meeting in Jalandhar in October 1966, where it was decided that the party should only form alliances with select left parties.

=== Naxalbari uprising (1967) ===

At this point, the party stood at crossroads. There were radical sections of the party who were wary of the increasing parliamentary focus of the party leadership, especially after the electoral victories in West Bengal and Kerala. Developments in China also affected the situation inside the party. In West Bengal, two separate internal dissident tendencies emerged, which both could be identified as supporting the Chinese line.

In 1967, a peasant uprising broke out in Naxalbari, in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal. The hardliners within CPI(M) saw the Naxalbari uprising as the spark that would ignite the Indian revolution. The CPC hailed the Naxalbari movement, causing an abrupt break in CPI(M)-CPC relations.

The Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government, of which CPI(M) was a major partner. Within the party, the hardliners rallied around an All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries. Following the 1968 Burdwan plenum of CPI(M) (held on 5–12 April 1968), the AICCCR separated itself from CPI(M). This split divided the party throughout the country. But notably in West Bengal, which was the center of the violent radicalized stream, no prominent leading figure left the party. The party and the Naxalites (as the rebels were called) were soon to get into a bloody feud.

In Andhra Pradesh, another revolt was taking place. There the pro-Naxalbari dissidents had not established any presence. But in the party organization, there were many veterans from the Telangana armed struggle, who rallied against the central party leadership. In Andhra Pradesh, the radicals had a strong base even amongst the state-level leadership. The main leader of the radical tendency was T. Nagi Reddy, a member of the state legislative assembly. On 15 June 1968, the leaders of the radical tendency published a press statement outlining the critique of the development of CPI(M). It was signed by T. Nagi Reddy, D.V. Rao, Kolla Venkaiah, and Chandra Pulla Reddy.

In total, around 50% of the party cadres in Andhra Pradesh left the party to form the Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, under the leadership of T. Nagi Reddy.

=== Dismissal of United Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala (1967–1970) ===

In November 1967, the West Bengal United Front government was dismissed by the central government. Initially, the Indian National Congress formed a minority government led by Prafulla Chandra Ghosh, but that cabinet did not last long. Following the proclamation that the United Front government had been dislodged, a 48-hour hartal was effective throughout the state. After the fall of the Ghosh cabinet, the state was put under President&#x27;s Rule. CPI(M) launched agitations against the interventions of the central government in West Bengal.

The 8th Party Congress of CPI(M) was held in Kochi, Kerala, on 23–29 December 1968. On 25 December 1968, whilst the congress was held, 42 Dalits were burned alive in the Tamil Nadu village of Kizhavenmani. The massacre was a retaliation from landlords after Dalit labourers had taken part in a CPI(M)-led agitation for higher wages.

The United Front government in Kerala was forced out of office in October 1969, as the CPI, RSP, KTP, and Muslim League ministers resigned. E.M.S. Namboodiripad handed in his resignation on 24 October. A coalition government led by CPI leader C. Achutha Menon was formed, with the outside support of the Indian National Congress.

==== Elections in West Bengal and Kerala ====
Fresh elections were held in West Bengal in 1969. CPI(M) contested 97 seats and won 80. The party was now the largest in the West Bengal legislative. But with the active support of CPI and the Bangla Congress, Ajoy Mukherjee was returned as Chief Minister of the state. Mukherjee resigned on 16 March 1970, after a pact had been reached between CPI, Bangla Congress, and the Indian National Congress against CPI(M). CPI(M) strove to form a new government, instead but the central government put the state under President&#x27;s Rule.

=== Land Reform ===

Though land reform was successfully done in three Indian states (West Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu), India&#x27;s first land reform was done in West Bengal in 1967, under the leadership of two Communist leaders: Hare Krishna Konar and Benoy Choudhury, in which Hare Krishna Konar played a leading role in getting surplus land held by big land owners in excess of land ceiling laws and kept ‘benami&#x27; (or false names) vested with the state. The quantum of land thus vested was around one million acres (4,000 km2) of good agricultural land. Subsequently, under the leadership of Hare Krishna Konar and Benoy Choudhury land was distributed amongst 2.4 million landless and poor farmers. Later after 1970 the united front government of west Bengal fail and the land reform was also stopped for seven years and after left front came in West Bengal in 1977 this land reform was renamed to Operation Barga and this barga was the notable contribution to the people from Left Front Government of West Bengal. To begin with, group meetings between Officials and Bargadars were organized during &quot;settlement camps&quot; (also called &quot;Reorientation camps&quot;), where the bargadars could discuss their grievances. The first such camp was held at Halusai in Polba taluk in Hooghly district from 18 to 20 May 1978. In noted camp, two Adibashi Borgaders objected procedure adopted by the official for Barga Operation. They suggested to start it organising people in the field instead of sitting in the houses of rural rich people or the places dominated by them.

=== Formation of CITU (1970) ===

Centre of Indian Trade Unions, CITU is a National level Trade Union in India and its trade union wing is a spearhead of the Indian Trade Union Movement. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions is today one of biggest assembly of workers and classes of India. It has strong unchallengeable presence in the Indian state of Tripura besides a good presence in West Bengal, Kerala and Kanpur. They have an average presence in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

 According to the provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, CITU had a membership of approximately 6,040,000 in 2015.

Tapan Kumar Sen is the General Secretary and K. Hemalata is the president of CITU. K. Hemalata was the first woman President in CITU who was elected after A. K. Padmanabhan. It runs a monthly organ named &quot;WORKING CLASS&quot;.

CITU is affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions.

=== Outbreak of war in East Pakistan (1971–1972) ===

In 1971, Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) declared its independence from Pakistan. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising. India intervened militarily and gave active backing to the Bangladeshi rebels. Millions of Bangladeshi refugees sought shelter in India, especially in West Bengal.

At the time, the radical sections of the Bangladeshi communist movement were divided into many factions. Whilst the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Bangladesh actively participated in the rebellion, the pro-China communist tendency found itself in a peculiar situation as China had sided with Pakistan in the war. In Calcutta, where many Bangladeshi leftists had sought refuge, CPI(M) worked to co-ordinate the efforts to create a new political organization. In the fall of 1971 three small groups, which were all hosted by the CPI(M), came together to form the Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist). The new party became the sister party of CPI(M) in Bangladesh.

=== Boycott of Assembly and Emergency rule (1972–1977) ===
In 1975, the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi imposed a State of emergency on the premise of internal disturbances suspending elections, legitimising rule by decree and curbing civil liberties. The proposition for the declaration of the emergency and the formal draft of the ordinance were both notably corroborated to have been forwarded by Siddhartha Shankar Ray. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged as one of the primary opposition to The Emergency (India). The following period witnessed a succession of authoritarian measures and political repression, which was particularly severe in West Bengal. The members of the CPI-M&#x27;s labour union became the first subject to political repression and mass arrests while the rest of the members of the CPI-M went underground.

With the initiation of the Jayaprakash Narayan (JP)&#x27;s movement, the CPI-M began providing support to it and went on to participate in discussions for the creation of a united front under the umbrella of the Janata Party. Several of the leaders of the CPI-M were also influenced by JP with Jyoti Basu noted to be one of his prominent admirers having worked under him in the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation during the 1940s. The involvement of the Hindutva movement however complicated matters, according to JP the formal inclusion of the marxists who had undergone a splintering and whose organisation was localised in particular region would have been detrimental to the movement as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members would switch sides if they joined. JP and Basu eventually came to an agreement that the CPI-M would not formally join the Janata Party as it would weaken the movement. After the revocation of the emergency, the CPI-M joined an electoral alliance with the Janata Party in the 1977 Indian general election which resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Janata Alliance.

=== Left Front Government formation in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura assembly (1977 afterwards) ===
==== West Bengal ====
CPI(M) West Bengal under the leadership of Jyoti Basu fought the 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. Initially the election was planned to fight in alliance with the Janata Party but the negotiations between the parties broke down. This led to a three sided contested between the Indian National Congress, the Janata Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led Left Front coalition. The results of the election was a surprising sweep for the Left Front winning 230 seats out of 290 with the CPI-M winning an absolute majority on its own, Basu became the Chief Minister of West Bengal. From the 1977 election the CPI(M) led Left Front won 7 continuous elections till 2011. Under Jyoti Basu&#x27;s leadership the Left Front won, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1991, 1996 elections. For the next 23 years he was the Chief Minister of West Bengal making him longest serving at this position. 

In the late 2000s the Left Front saw a change in leadership. Under the leadership of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the Left Front won the elections of 2001 elections and 2006. From 2000 to 2011, remained the Chief Minister of West Bengal for 11 years.

Following the events of 2007 Nandigram anti land acquisition violence and the 2006 Singur anti land acquisition violence, led by opposition parties in West Bengal. In the 2011 assembly election lost the elections marking the end of 34-year rule of Left Front, the longest-serving democratically elected communist government in the world, a fact that was noted by international media. After 2021 elections the Left Front has no representatives in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly.

==== Kerala ====
After the CPI split in 1964, prominent communist leader in Kerala E.M.S. Namboodiripad, A. K. Gopalan and K. R. Gouri Amma stood with the Communist Party of India (Marxist). One year after the split, in the 1965 elections CPI(M) which was splinter faction of CPI, emerged as the largest party in the assembly with 40 seats. Where CPI settled with 3 seats only. However no single party could form a ministry commanding majority and hence this election is considered abortive. President&#x27;s rule was invoked for the fourth time.

In the 1967 Kerala assembly election both communist parties - CPI (M) and CPI - along with smaller parties including SSP and Muslim League contested this election as a United Front. A total of seven parties contested in the front, and the front was known as &quot;Saptakakshi Munnani&quot;. The CPI(M) led front won the election with a record 113 seats out of 133 seats and formed the government under E.M.S. Namboodiripad.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two main pre-poll political alliances were formed: the Left Democratic Front (LDF) led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India and the United Democratic Front (UDF), led by the Indian National Congress. These pre-poll political alliances of Kerala have stabilized strongly in such a manner that, with rare exceptions, most of the coalition partners stick their loyalty to the respective alliances (Left Democratic Front or United Democratic Front).

LDF first came into power in Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1980 under the leadership of E. K. Nayanar who later became the longest serving Chief minister of Kerala, ever since 1980 election, the power has been clearly alternating between the two alliances till the 2016. In 2016, LDF won the 2016 election and had a historic re-election in 2021 election where an incumbent government was re-elected for first time in 40 years. Pinarayi Vijayan is the first chief minister of Kerala to be re-elected after completing a full term (five years) in office.

==== Tripura ====
Under the leadership of Nripen Chakraborty, the CPI(M) led Left Front won the 1977 assembly elections. Nripen Chakraborty, became the first Chief minister of Tripura from CPI(M). In the next 1983 assembly elections the incumbent government of Left Front was again re-elected and therefore it was in the government for 10 years. In 1988 assembly elections CPI(M) was out of power for 5 years despite being the largest party by seats won. In 1993 assembly elections, the Left Front won the elections and Dasarath Deb sworn in as the Chief minister of Tripura.

From 1993 to 2013, the Left Front won 5 elections continuously. Since the 1998 assembly elections, Manik Sarkar was the Chief minister of Tripura for 20 years making him the longest serving at the position in Tripura. Under his leadership the Left Front has won 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013. Currently, CPI(M) is the main opposition party in the Tripura Legislative Assembly.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the dominant party in the coalition. The other four members of the Left Front are the Communist Party of India, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, the All India Forward Bloc and the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation.

All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was founded in 1936, which predominantly became active in Bihar. By 1942, AIKS and communists dominated the peasant movement in the country. The members of AIKS or Kisan Sabha were mostly communists. This created a political and social base for communists in Bihar. Sahajanand Saraswati, Karyanand Sharma, Bhogendra Jha were most notable leaders of the movement. Afterwards Bakasht movement (1946–1952), Madhubani movement, Darbhanga movement mobilised Left politics in the state.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Punjab has an eventful history, connected with the state&#x27;s socio-political landscape and its struggle for workers&#x27; rights, agrarian reforms, and social justice. The roots of the CPI(M) in Punjab can be traced back to the early 20th century with the emergence of various revolutionary movements. Two significant organizations that played a crucial role in shaping the communist movement in Punjab were the Gaddar Party, formed in 1913, and the Lal Communist Party, established in 1928. While the Gaddar Party aimed at seeking India&#x27;s independence from British colonial rule through armed resistance, the Lal Communist Party focused on empowering peasants and labourers through revolutionary means.

After India gained independence in 1947, the Communist Party of India (CPI) was formed through the amalgamation of various leftist groups, including the Lal Communist Party. However, ideological differences within the CPI led to a split, resulting in the formation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) in 1964. The CPI(M) in Punjab has consistently advocated for land reforms, workers&#x27; rights, and social equality. It has garnered support among the rural and urban poor, particularly in areas with a strong agrarian base. The party actively participated in various social and political movements, aiming to uplift the marginalized sections of society and improve their living conditions.

During the 1980s, Punjab faced a crisis with the rise of the Khalistan movement, seeking a separate Sikh state. The Khalistan movement posed a significant challenge to not only the Indian state but also to Punjab. During this period, the CPI(M) opposed the Khalistan movement and stood for a united India. In the late 1990s, the CPI(M) faced internal divisions, leading to a significant split. One prominent faction led by Mangat Ram Pasla formed a new party called the Communist Party of Marxist (CPM) in Punjab, pursuing its own ideological path. This internal rift had an impact on the party&#x27;s organizational structure and electoral presence.

Over the years, the CPI(M) experienced a waning presence on the electoral front in Punjab. The changing political dynamics, rise of regional parties, and the diminishing appeal of communist ideology in a globalized world contributed to its reduced influence in electoral politics. Despite the challenges, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Punjab continues to be active in advocating for workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; rights and participating in social and political movements. Its history reflects the complexities of Punjab&#x27;s political landscape and its contribution to the larger communist movement in India.

====Rajasthan====
In the 2008 Rajasthan Legislative Assembly election, CPIM secured three seats from Anupgarh, Dhod and Danta Ramgarh. Along with six other parties, CPIM formed Loktantrik Morcha in 2013. However, CPIM could not win any seats in the 2013 Legislative Assembly election. The party made a comeback in the state by winning two seats out 28 seats they contested in the 2018 Legislative Assembly election.

====Tamil Nadu====

CPIM, as a part of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam front in 1989 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, won 15 seats. In 2006, CPIM was the part of the alliance led by DMK. The party contested in 13 seats and won 9 seats. In the next election, CPIM joined All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam coalition and won 10 seats out of the 12 seats they contested. But the party was unable to secure any seat in 2016. In 2019 Indian general election, CPIM won two seats from Coimbatore and Madurai in Tamil Nadu. In 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, CPIM made a comeback by winning two seats. In 2022, CPI(M) won many seats in the municipal corporation elections. T. Nagarajan of CPI(M) got the post of Deputy Mayor in Madurai Municipal Corporation.

====Telangana====
In 2014, CPIM won in one seat in Andhra Pradesh, which subsequently went to Telangana state. However, in 2018 CPIM won no seats. In 2022 Munugode by-election, CPIM supported the candidate fielded by Bharat Rashtra Samithi. In 2023, CPIM will contest the election in alliance with BRS.

==State legislative assembly election results ==

== Indian general elections results ==


=== 1967 general election ===
In the 1967 Lok Sabha elections, the CPI(M) nominated 59 candidates. In total 19 of them were elected. The party received 6.2 million votes (4.28% of the nationwide vote). By comparison, CPI won 23 seats and got 5.11% of the nationwide vote. In the state legislative elections held simultaneously, the CPI(M) emerged as a major party in Kerala and West Bengal. In Kerala, a United Front government led by E.M.S. Namboodiripad was formed. In West Bengal, the CPI(M) was the main force behind the United Front government formed. The Chief Ministership was given to Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress (a regional splinter group of the Indian National Congress).

=== 1971 general election ===
With the backdrop of the Bangladesh War and the emerging role of Indira Gandhi as a populist national leader, the 1971 election to the Lok Sabha was held. The CPI(M) contested 85 seats and won in 25. In total the party mustered 7510089 votes (5.12% of the national vote). 20 of the seats came from West Bengal (including Somnath Chatterjee, elected from Burdwan), two from Kerala (including A.K. Gopalan, elected from Palakkad), two from Tripura (Biren Dutta and Dasarath Deb) and one from Andhra Pradesh.

In the same year, state legislative elections were held in three states; West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha. In West Bengal CPI(M), had 241 candidates, winning 113 seats. In total the party mustered 4241557 votes (32.86% of the statewide vote). In Tamil Nadu CPI(M), contested 37 seats but won none of them, obtaining 259298 votes (1.65% of the statewide vote). In Odisha, the party contested 11 seats and won in two. The CPI(M) vote in the state was 52785 (1.2% of the statewide vote).

=== 1977 general election ===
In the 1977 Lok Sabha election, the CPI(M) fielded its candidates on 53 seats scattered around in 14 states and union territories of India. It won 4.29% of the average votes polled in this election. The party had won 17 seats from West Bengal, three from Maharashtra, and one each from Odisha and Punjab. This election was done shortly after the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi and reflected a wide uproar of masses against her draconian rule. A coalition of Opposition parties was formed against the Congress regime; CPI(M) too supported this coalition by not fielding its candidates against the Janta Party.

=== 1980 general elections ===
The Janta Party coalition did not last long, and two years after its formation India faced the 1980 Lok Sabha election. This election saw an increase in the vote percentage of CPI(M) and the party secured more seats than the previous elections. The Party had contested elections in the 15 states and union territories of India and fielded its candidates on 64 seats. The party had won 37 seats in total. It won 28 seats in West Bengal, seven in Kerala, and two seats in Tripura. The party emerged out as the whole sole representative of the people of Tripura in this election.

=== 2014 Lok Sabha election ===

Nine CPI(M) candidates were elected in the 2014 Indian general election, as well as two CPI(M)-supported independents. This is further down from the previous number of 16. The national vote share of CPI(M) has also shrunk from 5.33% in 2009 to mere 3.28% in 2014. This is a significant 38.5% reduction within a span of five years which is consistent with the overall decline of the left in India. CPI(M) did not win a single seat in Tamil Nadu and its seats went down from 9 to 2 in West Bengal where it is being heavily eroded by Mamata Banerjee governed AITC. Kerala is the only state where CPI(M) gained one more seat but this is mainly attributed to the splitting of anti-LDF votes between the UDF and emerging NDA. The NDA saw a sharp spike in vote share in decades which came coupled with a sharp decline in UDF votes. Thus, it is assumed that the NDA cut into UDF votes thereby facilitating victory for LDF. This was again mirrored during the 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, which saw the NDA getting entry into the State Assembly for the first time as BJP veteran O. Rajagopal wins the Nemom seat and CPI(M)&#x27;s Pinarayi Vijayan forming the LDF-ruled government.

=== 2019 general election ===

The CPI(M) contested on 69 seats nationwide and won three in the 2019 general election. One seat was won in Kerala, where the CPI(M) is leading the state government. Two other seats were won in Tamil Nadu, where the CPI(M) contested within the DMK-led coalition.
=== 2024 general election===
The CPI(M) contested on 52 seats nationwide and won four in the 2024 general election. One seat was won in Kerala, One seat in Rajasthan and two more in Tamil Nadu under the-DMK led coalition.

== Indian Presidential elections==
=== 2002 presidential election ===
In the 2002 Presidential election, Left Front announced Captain Lakshmi Sehgal as its presidential candidate. Against her was the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s candidate A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. CPI(M)&#x27;s leadership announced that in form of Captain Lakshmi, they were fielding an &#x27;Alternative Candidate&#x27;. They said that though it was clear that Captain Lakshmi could not become president because of the opposition of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Indian National Congress to her, yet through this Presidential Election, the Left wished to raise key national issues and make them heard by the masses. Captain Lakshmi herself pointed out that this Presidential election reflected the opposition of the Indian Left to the communal-sectarian politics of BJP, and the Left&#x27;s solidarity with the religious minorities who had suffered greatly under the NDA&#x27;s leadership.

=== 2012 Presidential election ===
While CPI(M) supported Pranab Mukherjee as presidential candidate in 2012 presidential election, it was in favour of a non-Congress candidate for the post of the Vice-President.

<doc id="408207" wikidata="Q219530" url="?curid=408207" title="Inveraray">
<text>Inveraray ( ; &quot;mouth of the Aray&quot;) is a town in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is on the western shore of Loch Fyne, near its head, and on the A83 road. It is a former royal burgh, the traditional county town of Argyll, and ancestral seat to the Duke of Argyll. Known affectionately as &quot;The Capital of Argyll&quot; 

During the Second World War the Combined Operations Training Centre, located close to the town, was an important military facility.

==Coat of arms==

The town&#x27;s coat of arms depicts a net cast out over the ocean, entangled in which are five herrings and the Latin motto &quot;SEMPER TIBI PENDEAT HALEC&quot; (possible English translation: &quot;may a herring always hang to thee&quot;).

Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, in his 1909 book &quot;A Complete Guide to Heraldry&quot;, notes the following:

&quot;There&quot; is no doubt of its ancient usage. ...and the blazon of the coat, according to the form it is depicted upon the Corporate seal, would be for the field: &quot;The sea proper, therein a net suspended from the dexter chief and the sinister fess points to the base; and entangled in its meshes five herrings,&quot; which is about the most remarkable coat of arms I have ever come across.

==Inveraray Castle==


In 1744 the third Duke of Argyll decided to demolish the existing castle and start from scratch with a new building. The castle was 40 years in construction, and the work was largely supervised by the Adam family, still renowned to this day as gifted architects and designers. The end product was not a castle in the traditional sense, but a classic Georgian mansion house on a grand scale, Inveraray Castle.

Over the years the castle has played host to numerous luminaries; Queen Victoria visited it in 1874, and the Royal connection was further cemented when her daughter, Princess Louise, married the heir to the Campbell chieftainship, the Marquess of Lorne, in 1871, illustrating the elevated position of the Argyll family in the social order of the times.
==Rebuilding the town==
In 1747, William Adam had drawn up plans for the creation of a new Inveraray. By 1770, little had been done, and the fifth Duke set about rebuilding the town in its present form. Some of the work on the rebuilt Inveraray was done by John Adam. The Inveraray Inn (formerly known as the New Inn, Great Inn, Argyll Arms Hotel and Argyll Hotel) on Front Street being his, as well as the Town House. Much of the rest of the town, including the church, was designed and built by the celebrated Edinburgh-born architect Robert Mylne (1733-1811) between 1772 and 1800.

The end product was an attractive town which included houses for estate workers, a woollen mill, and a pier to exploit herring fishing, which was to grow in later years to play a major role in the town&#x27;s economy. The finished product is one of the best examples of an 18th-century new town in Scotland, and the vast majority of the properties in the centre of Inveraray are considered worthy of protection because of the town&#x27;s architectural significance.
==Tourist attractions==

In addition to the castle, the Georgian Inveraray Jail in the burgh is now a museum. Other attractions include the Argyll Folk Museum at Auchindrain. The Celtic &quot;Inveraray Cross&quot; can also been seen in the town. The Clyde puffers VIC 72, &quot;Vital Spark&quot;. The Bell Tower dominates the town, and contains the second-heaviest ring of ten bells in the world. The bell tower is open to the public, and the bells are rung regularly.

===Dun Na Cuaiche, Tower===
Is a folly of a ruined watch tower overlooking Inveraray and Loch Fyne. Built 1747-48 by William Douglas, at a contract price of £46 for the mason work, commissioned by the 3rd Duke of Argyll. 

==Media==

In autumn 2014, PBS premiered a series, &quot;Great Estates of Scotland&quot;. Inveraray was featured in one episode, as was the present Duke of Argyll, head of the Campbell clan.

From 1968 to 1970, Davis garnered attention playing multiple characters on the daytime Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. He played Peter Bradford, Jeff Clark, Ned Stuart, Dirk Wilkins, and Charles Delaware Tate.

In 1971, Davis narrated the voiceover theme sequence for the western series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, starring Pete Duel as Hannibal Heyes/Joshua Smith and Ben Murphy as Jedidiah &quot;Kid&quot; Curry/Thaddeus Jones. He also appeared in one of the episodes (&quot;Smiler with a Gun&quot;) as slick gunfighter Danny Bilson. Bilson has the distinction of being the only character kind-hearted Kid Curry was ever driven to kill during the series. Also in 1971, he appeared in season 12, episode 17 of &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

When Pete Duel committed suicide at the end of 1971, Davis replaced him as Hannibal Heyes. However, after Davis completed just 17 episodes, it was clear the show would not achieve the same level of popularity it had with Pete Duel. The series ended in 1973 when competition from the popular &quot;Flip Wilson Show&quot; siphoned the show&#x27;s ratings.

Davis continued to act in guest-starring roles on TV series throughout the 1970s as well as the occasional film appearance in movies such as &quot;Killer Bees&quot; (1974), &quot;Flash and the Firecat&quot; (1975), &quot;Nashville Girl&quot; (1976), &quot;Ruby&quot; (1977), and &quot;Aspen&quot; (1977), and he has been a voiceover actor for thousands of TV and radio commercials. In 2000, he appeared in the film &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;. Davis regularly attends fan conventions for both &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, and in 2011, he reprised his role of Charles Delaware Tate in both &quot;The Blind Painter&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Pearl&quot;, new audio plays of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. In 2019, Davis appeared as himself in the documentary movie &quot;Master of Dark Shadows&quot;, a direct-to-DVD release.

==Business career==
Davis developed land and built luxury homes in southern California until 2010, and continues to design and renovate luxury properties in the greater Los Angeles area as of 2022. He owns an interest in movie developer Lonetree Entertainment in Los Angeles. He also renovated the famous Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky, and built a luxury condominium building there, known as 1400 Willow. His family owned Davis Tire Company in Louisville.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Davis married actress Jaclyn Smith. After a brief separation, they divorced in January 1975. During his second marriage to Ohioan Suzanne Irwin (Emerson), Roger became a father to a daughter Margaret in 1981. The family resided at Spring Station, Louisville, Kentucky&#x27;s oldest home, built in 1791. After a divorce in 1983, Davis was married to realtor Alice LeGette from 1985 to 1988. In 1991, Davis married Los Angeles attorney Donna Jenis; they divorced in 1996.

<text>A. Charles Muller (born September 19, 1953) is a Japan-based academic specializing in Korean Buddhism and East Asian Yogacara, having published numerous books and articles on these topics. He was one of the earliest developers of online research resources for the field of Buddhist Studies and the founder and managing editor of the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, the CJKV-English Dictionary, and the H-Buddhism Scholars Information Network, along with having digitized and published numerous reference works.

==Early life and education==
Muller was raised in Yaphank, New York. He was the youngest of three children. He became interested in East Asia when he began taking karate classes in high school after being bullied.

Muller first took college classes at the University of Dayton in 1971, on a pre-med path. However, he later dropped out. In 1980 he returned to college at Suffolk County Community College, where he studied for a year before transferring to Stony Brook University. Muller&#x27;s academic study of Buddhism began at Stony Brook, where he majored in Religious Studies under the guidance of Sung Bae Park, a specialist in Seon and Korean Buddhism. 

After graduating, he spent two years studying in Japan, after which he spent one year in the graduate program in Religious Studies at the University of Virginia. In 1988, he left UVA to return to Stony Brook, where he completed a PhD in Comparative literature, once again with Sung Bae Park as his principal advisor. He also studied Christian Theology with Peter Manchester, Islam with William Chittick, and postmodern literary criticism with Michael Sprinker and Hugh Silverman. His dissertation, &quot;Hamhŏ Kihwa: A Study of His Major Works,&quot; was accepted in 1993, after which he spent six months in Korea as a research associate at the Academy of Korean Studies, before taking up an academic position in Japan, at Toyo Gakuen University.

==Career==
From 1994 to 2008, Muller taught courses in philosophy and religion at Toyo Gakuen University, during which time he published books and articles on Korean Buddhism, Zen, East Asian Yogacara, and Confucianism. While active in numerous academic organizations such as the American Academy of Religion and the Japanese Association for Indian and Buddhist Studies, he also created online research resources. In 1995, he set up a website called Resources for East Asian Language and Thought, which features online lexicons, indexes, bibliographies, and translations of classical texts. In 1997, he started the Budschol listserv for the academic study of Buddhism, which would, in 2000, become part of H-Net, under the name of H-Buddhism. 

He also initiated two major dictionary projects, the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism and the CJKV-E Dictionary. His work in the area of online reference works and digitization led him into the field of Digital Humanities, with his principal area of expertise lying in the handling of literary documents using XML and XSLT. In 2008, Muller was invited to join the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Tokyo, where he taught courses in Digital Humanities, Chinese Philosophy, and Korean Philosophy and Religion. 

He retired from UTokyo in March 2019 and moved to Musashino University, where he is director of the Institute of Buddhist culture and teaches courses in Buddhist Studies.

<doc id="408212" wikidata="Q507125" url="?curid=408212" title="Yateley">
<text>Yateley () is a town and civil parish in the English county of Hampshire. It lies in the north-eastern corner of Hart District Council area, and is approximately 33 mi (53 km) southwest of Central London. It includes the settlements of Frogmore and Darby Green to the east. Yateley&#x27;s population was 20,334 at the 2021 census.

Yateley Town Council is one of the few local councils recognised under the national &#x27;Quality Council&#x27; award scheme.

In 2011, Hart district was named the UK&#x27;s most desirable place to live, and Yateley was mentioned in a BBC News article as one of its towns. Yateley is known for hosting a family music festival every summer, Gig on the Green, and a beer and wine festival every autumn - Blackwater Valley Cask &amp; Cork Festival.

==History==
The name &quot;Yateley&quot; derives from the Middle English &#x27;Yate&#x27; meaning &#x27;Gate&#x27; (into Windsor Forest) and &#x27;Lea&#x27;, a &#x27;forest clearing&#x27;.

In historical records, spelling variations include Hyatele, Yateleghe, Yatche, Yatelighe, Yeatley, Yeateley and Yatelegh.

==Amenities==

The parish church is St Peter&#x27;s. It was badly damaged in a fire in 1979 and subsequently restored. Its outstanding feature is an early 16th-century wooden bell tower, housing a ring of eight bells. The tower survived the fire but the bells were cracked and had to be recast. The church is a Grade II listed building. The White Lion pub, in the centre of Yateley, is also Grade II listed.

==Transport==
Yateley was never served by the railway network - the nearest station is Sandhurst, away. Sandhurst station is on the North Downs Line which runs from Reading to Guildford, Redhill and Gatwick Airport. The line is operated by Great Western Railway (GWR).

Stagecoach operates bus route 3 between Yateley and Aldershot every 15 minutes except on Sundays. The route goes via Camberley, Frimley, Mytchett, and Ash Vale.

==Sport==
Yateley United F.C. was formed in 2013, playing their home games at recently developed Sean Devereux Park. Yateley United&#x27;s first team currently compete in Combined Counties League division one.

Yateley Cricket Club was established in 1881, playing originally at the Cricketers pub on Cricket Hill and then on &quot;The Green&quot; on Reading Road. In 1999, the club moved to a new purpose-built ground and clubhouse at Sean Devereux Park.

==Education==

Following the closure and amalgamation of St Peter&#x27;s Church of England Junior School and Yateley Infant School, a new primary school opened in September 2010. Named Cranford Park CE Primary School.

Yateley School is the largest secondary school in north-east Hampshire. It caters for children aged 11 to 16 and has an attached sixth-form college.

Frogmore Community College is another secondary school in Yateley.

Yateley Manor School is an independent school catering for around 500 pupils aged 3 to 13.

<text>Ford&#x27;s Theatre is a theater located in Washington, D.C., which opened in 1863. The theater is best known for being the site of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. On the night of April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth entered the theater box where Lincoln was watching a performance of Tom Taylor&#x27;s play &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, slipped the single-shot, 5.87-inch derringer from his pocket and fired at Lincoln&#x27;s head. After being shot, the fatally wounded Lincoln was carried across the street to the nearby Petersen House, where he died the next morning.

The theater was later used as a warehouse and government office building. In 1893, part of its interior flooring collapsed, causing 22 deaths, and needed repairs were made. The building became a museum in 1932, and it was renovated and re-opened as a theater in 1968. A related Center for Education and Leadership museum opened in 2012, next to Petersen House.

The Petersen House and the theater are preserved together as Ford&#x27;s Theatre National Historic Site, administered by the National Park Service; programming within the theater and the Center for Education is overseen separately by the Ford&#x27;s Theatre Society.

== History ==


The site was originally a house of worship, constructed in 1833 as the second meeting house of the First Baptist Church of Washington, with Obadiah Bruen Brown as the pastor. In 1861, after the congregation moved to a newly built structure, John T. Ford bought the former church and renovated it into a theater. He first called it Ford&#x27;s Athenaeum. It was destroyed by fire in 1862 and was rebuilt.

=== Assassination of President Lincoln ===
On April 14, 1865—just five days after General Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House—Lincoln and his wife attended a performance of &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Ford&#x27;s Theatre. The famous actor John Wilkes Booth, desperate to aid the dying Confederacy, made his way into the presidential box and shot Lincoln. Booth then jumped down to the stage and escaped through a rear door. This was witnessed by a theater full of people, possibly including the then 5-year-old Samuel J. Seymour who claimed to be the last living witness to the Lincoln assassination before his death in 1956. 

Following the assassination, the United States government appropriated the theater. Congress paid Ford $88,000 in compensation, and an order was issued forever prohibiting its use as a place of public amusement. Between 1866 and 1887, the theater was taken over by the U.S. military and served as a facility for the War Department with records kept on the first floor, the Library of the Surgeon General&#x27;s Office on the second floor, and the Army Medical Museum on the third. In 1887, the building exclusively became a clerk&#x27;s office for the Record and Pension Office of the War Department when the medical departments moved out.

=== Disrepair and restoration ===
On June 9, 1893, the front section of the three interior floors collapsed when a supporting pillar was undermined during excavation of the cellar, killing 22 clerks and injuring another 68. This led some people to believe that the former church turned theater and storeroom was cursed. The building was repaired and Record and Pension Office clerks were moved back on July 30, 1894.

In 1928, the building was turned over from the War Department Office to the Office of Public Buildings and Parks of the National Capital. A Lincoln museum opened on the first floor of the theater building on February 12, 1932—Lincoln&#x27;s 123rd birthday. In 1933, the building was transferred to the National Park Service.

The restoration of Ford&#x27;s Theatre was brought about by the two-decade-long lobbying efforts of Democratic National Committeeman Melvin D. Hildreth and Republican North Dakota Representative Milton Young. Hildreth first suggested to Young the need for its restoration in 1945. Through extensive lobbying of Congress, a bill was passed in 1955 to prepare an engineering study for the reconstruction of the building. In 1964, Congress approved funds for its restoration, which began that year and was completed in 1968.

On January 21, 1968, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and 500 others dedicated the restored theater. The theater reopened on January 30, 1968, with a gala performance.
The presidential box is never occupied.

The theater was again renovated during the 2000s. It has a current seating capacity of 665. The reopening ceremony was on February 11, 2009, which commemorated Lincoln&#x27;s 200th birthday. The event featured remarks from President Barack Obama as well as appearances by Katie Couric, Kelsey Grammer, James Earl Jones, Ben Vereen, Jeffrey Wright, the President&#x27;s Own Marine Band, Joshua Bell, Patrick Lundy and the Ministers of Music, Audra McDonald and Jessye Norman.

In March of every year, the Abraham Lincoln Institute holds a symposium at Ford&#x27;s Theatre.

== Ford&#x27;s Theatre National Historic Site ==
The National Historic Site consisting of two contributing buildings, the theater and the Petersen House, was designated in 1932.

The Ford&#x27;s Theatre Museum beneath the theater contains portions of the Olroyd Collection of Lincolniana. Most recently renovated for a July 2009 reopening, the Museum is run through a partnership with the National Park Service and the private non-profit 501(c)(3) Ford&#x27;s Theatre Society. The collection includes multiple items related to the assassination, including the Derringer pistol used to carry out the shooting, Booth&#x27;s diary and the original door to Lincoln&#x27;s theater box. In addition, a number of Lincoln&#x27;s family items, his coat (without the blood-stained pieces), some statues of Lincoln and several large portraits of the President are on display in the museum. The blood-stained pillow from the President&#x27;s deathbed is in the Ford&#x27;s Theatre Museum. In addition to covering the assassination conspiracy, the renovated museum focuses on Lincoln&#x27;s arrival in Washington, his presidential cabinet, family life in the White House and his role as orator and emancipator. The museum also features exhibits about Civil War milestones and generals and about the building&#x27;s history as a theatrical venue. The rocking chair in which Lincoln was sitting is now on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

=== Petersen House ===

After Lincoln was shot, doctors had soldiers carry him into the street in search of a house in which he would be more comfortable. A man on the steps of the house of tailor William Petersen beckoned to them. They took Lincoln into the first-floor bedroom and laid him on the beddiagonally because of his unusual height. Many people came to visit him throughout the night before he died the following morning at 7:22 a.m.

The Petersen House was purchased by the U.S. government in 1896 as the &quot;House Where Lincoln Died&quot;, being the federal government&#x27;s first purchase of a historic home.
The National Park Service has operated it as a historic house museum since 1933, the rooms furnished as on the night Lincoln died.

<text>The Communist Party of India (CPI) is the oldest communist party in India. The CPI was founded in modern-day Kanpur on 26 December 1925. 

In 1964, a split in the CPI caused the formation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the largest communist party in India.

Currently, the CPI has two members in Lok Sabha and two members in Rajya Sabha. In addition, it has 22 MLAs across four states and one MLC in Bihar. It has the current ECI status of a state party in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Manipur.

CPI was heavily involved in resistance to British colonisation, the fight against the caste system and for land reform. Between 1921 and 1933, many communist leaders were arrested and imprisoned. In 1934, the British colonial administration banned the Communist Party and its affiliated trade union and peasant organisations, making membership a criminal offence. The Communist Party continued its activities clandestinely, despite the repression. Between 1946 and 1951, it structured the peasant revolt in Telangana and organised guerrilla warfare against the feudal lords. The CPI was the main opposition party in India during the 1950s to 1960s.

CPI was part of the ruling United Front government from 1996 to 1998 and had two ministers under Devegowda and Gujral Ministry. The Left Front gave outside support to the V. P. Singh government (1989–90) and UPA government (2004–2009). The Left Front governed West Bengal for 34 years (1977–2011) and Tripura for 25 years (1993–2018).

As of December 2023, the CPI is a part of the state government in Kerala led by LDF. The CPI have four Cabinet Ministers and a Deputy Speaker in Kerala. In Tamil Nadu, it is in power with SPA coalition led by DMK. In Telangana, it is in alliance with the INC.

CPI, along with the Left Front, is part of the INDIA bloc formed to defeat the incumbent BJP-led right-wing NDA government in 2024 General elections.

==History==

===Formation===
The Communist Party of India (CPI) was formed on 26 December 1925 at the first Party Conference in Kanpur, which was then known as &quot;Cawnpore&quot;. S. V. Ghate was the first General Secretary of the CPI. There were many communist groups formed by Indians with the help of foreigners in different parts of the world, Tashkent group of Contacts were made with Anushilan and Jugantar the groups in Bengal, and small communist groups were formed in Bombay (led by S. A. Dange), Madras (led by Singaravelu), United Provinces (led by Shaukat Usmani), Punjab, Sindh (led by Ghulam Hussain), Orissa (led by Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi) and Bengal (led by Muzaffar Ahmed).

There is a dispute on the year of formation of CPI. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) which split from CPI in 1964, considers 17 October 1920 as the founding day of Communist Party of India. On this day, M. N. Roy, Evelyn Trent-Roy, Abani Mukherji, Rosa Fitingov, Mohd. Ali, Mohamad Shafiq, and M. P. T. Acharya met in Tashkent to form the communist movement in India. Though 1920 and 1925 both dates are insignificant, because on both of these occasions, the CPI did not adopt a &quot;Party Constitution&quot;, which was a foremost prerequisite required to be considered for the membership of the Communist International. The CPI considers 1925 as their founding day, but CPI(M) thinks 1920 as the year, when communist movement in India was founded. There is a technical dispute between both parties on this issue.

===Involvement in independence struggle===
During the 1920s and the early 1930s the party was poorly organised, and in practice there were several communist groups working with limited national co-ordination. The government banned all communist activity, which made the task of building a united party difficult. Between 1921 and 1924, there were three conspiracy trials against the communist movement: the Peshawar Conspiracy Cases, the Meerut Conspiracy Case, and the Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case. In the first three cases, Russian-trained muhajir communists were put on trial. However, the Cawnpore (now spelt Kanpur) trial had more political impact. On 17 March 1924, Shripad Amrit Dange, M. N. Roy, Muzaffar Ahmad, Nalini Gupta, Shaukat Usmani, Malayapuram Singaravelu, Ghulam Hussain, and R. C. Sharma were charged, in Cawnpore Bolshevik Conspiracy case. The specific pip charge was that they as communists were seeking &quot;to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty of British India, by complete separation of India from Britain by a violent revolution.&quot; Pages of newspapers daily splashed sensational communist plans and people for the first time learned, on such a large scale, about communism and its doctrines and the aims of the Communist International in India.

Singaravelu Chettiar was released on account of illness. M. N. Roy was in Germany and R. C. Sharma in French Pondichéry, and therefore could not be arrested. Ghulam Hussain confessed that he had received money from the Russians in Kabul and was pardoned. Muzaffar Ahmed, Nalini Gupta, Shaukat Usmani and Dange were sentenced for various terms of imprisonment. This case was responsible for actively introducing communism to a larger Indian audience. Dange was released from prison in 1927. Rahul Dev Pal was a prominent communist leader.

On 26 December 1925, a communist conference was organised in Kanpur. Government authorities estimated that 500 persons took part in the conference. The conference was convened by a man called Satya Bhakta. At the conference Satyabhakta argued for a &#x27;National communism&#x27; and against subordination under the Comintern. Being outvoted by the other delegates, Satyabhakta left the conference venue in protest. The conference adopted the name &#x27;Communist Party of India&#x27;. Groups such as Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan (LKPH) dissolved into the CPI. The émigré CPI, which probably had little organic character anyway, was effectively substituted by the organisation now operating inside India.

Soon after the 1926 conference of the Workers and Peasants Party of Bengal, the underground CPI directed its members to join the provincial Workers and Peasants Parties. All open communist activities were carried out through Workers and Peasants Parties.

The sixth congress of the Communist International met in 1928. In 1927 the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The Colonial theses of the 6th Comintern congress called upon the Indian communists to combat the &#x27;national-reformist leaders&#x27; and to &#x27;unmask the national reformism of the Indian National Congress and oppose all phrases of the Swarajists, Gandhists, etc. about passive resistance&#x27;. The congress did however differentiate between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Indian Swarajist Party, considering the latter as neither a reliable ally nor a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian communists to use the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists. The congress also denounced the WPP. The Tenth Plenum of the executive committee of the Communist International, 3 July 192919 July 1929, directed the Indian communists to break with WPP. When the communists deserted it, the WPP fell apart.

On 20 March 1929, arrests against WPP, CPI and other labour leaders were made in several parts of India, in what became known as the Meerut Conspiracy Case. The communist leadership was now put behind bars. The trial proceedings were to last for four years.

As of 1934, the main centres of activity of CPI were Bombay, Calcutta and Punjab. The party had also begun extending its activities to Madras. A group of Andhra and Tamil students, amongst them P. Sundarayya, were recruited to the CPI by Amir Hyder Khan.

The party was reorganised in 1933, after the communist leaders from the Meerut trials were released. A central committee of the party was set up. In 1934, the party was accepted as the Indian section of the Communist International.

When Indian left-wing elements formed the Congress Socialist Party in 1934, the CPI branded it as Social Fascist.

The League Against Gandhism, initially known as the Gandhi Boycott Committee, was a political organisation in Calcutta, founded by the underground Communist Party of India and others to launch militant anti-Imperialist activities. The group took the name &#x27;League Against Gandhism&#x27; in 1934.

In connection with the change of policy of the Comintern toward popular front politics, the Indian communists changed their relation to the Indian National Congress. The communists joined the Congress Socialist Party, which worked as the left-wing of Congress. Through joining CSP, the CPI accepted the CSP demand for a Constituent Assembly, which it had denounced two years before. The CPI however analysed that the demand for a Constituent Assembly would not be a substitute for soviets.

In July 1937, a clandestine meeting was held at Calicut. Five persons were present at the meeting, P. Krishna Pillai, K. Damodaran, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, N. C. Sekhar and S.V. Ghate. The first four were members of the CSP in Kerala. The CPI in Kerala was formed on 31 December 1939 with the Pinarayi Conference. 
The latter, Ghate, was a CPI Central Committee member, who had arrived from Madras. Contacts between the CSP in Kerala and the CPI had begun in 1935, when P. Sundarayya (CC member of CPI, based in Madras at the time) met with E. M. S. Namboodiripad and Krishna Pillai. Sundarayya and Ghate visited Kerala at several times and met with the CSP leaders there. The contacts were facilitated through the national meetings of the Congress, CSP and All India Kisan Sabha.

In 1936–1937, the co-operation between socialists and communists reached its peak. At the 2nd congress of the CSP, held in Meerut in January 1936, a thesis was adopted which declared that there was a need to build &#x27;a united Indian Socialist Party based on Marxism-Leninism&#x27;. At the 3rd CSP congress, held in Faizpur, several communists were included into the CSP National Executive Committee.

Two communists, E. M. S. Namboodiripad and Z. A. Ahmed, became All India joint secretaries of CSP. The CPI also had two other members inside the CSP executive.

On the occasion of the 1940 Ramgarh Congress Conference, CPI released a declaration called &quot;Proletarian Path&quot;, which sought to use the weakened state of the British Empire in the time of war and gave a call for general strike, no-tax, no-rent policies and mobilising for an armed revolutionary uprising. The National Executive of the CSP assembled at Ramgarh took a decision that all communists were expelled from CSP.

In July 1942, the CPI was legalised, as a result of Britain and the Soviet Union becoming allies against Nazi Germany. Communists strengthened their control over the All India Trade Union Congress. At the same time, communists were politically cornered for their opposition to the Quit India Movement.

CPI contested the Provincial Legislative Assembly elections of 1946 on its own. It had candidates in 108 out of 1585 seats, winning in eight seats. In total, the CPI vote counted 666 723, which should be seen with the backdrop that 86% of the adult population of India lacked voting rights. The party had contested three seats in Bengal, and won all of them. One CPI candidate, Somnath Lahiri, was elected to the Constituent Assembly.

The Communist Party of India opposed the partition of India and did not participate in the Independence Day celebrations of 15 August 1947 in protest at the division of the country.

===After independence===

During the period around and directly following Independence in 1947, the internal situation in the party was chaotic. The party shifted rapidly between left-wing and right-wing positions. In February 1948, at the 2nd Party Congress in Calcutta, B. T. Ranadive (BTR) was elected General Secretary of the party. The conference adopted the &#x27;Programme of Democratic Revolution&#x27;. This programme included the first mention of struggle against caste injustice in a CPI document.

In several areas the party led armed struggles against a series of local monarchs that were reluctant to give up their power. Such insurgencies took place in Tripura, Telangana and Kerala. The most important rebellion took place in Telangana, against the Nizam of Hyderabad. The communists built up a people&#x27;s army and militia and controlled an area with a population of three million. The rebellion was brutally crushed and the party abandoned the policy of armed struggle. BTR was deposed and denounced as a &#x27;left adventurist&#x27;.

In Manipur, the party became a force to reckon with through the agrarian struggles led by Jananeta Irawat Singh. Singh had joined CPI in 1946. At the 1951 congress of the party, &#x27;People&#x27;s Democracy&#x27; was substituted by &#x27;National Democracy&#x27; as the main slogan of the party.

A Communist Party was founded in Bihar in 1939. Post independence, the Communist Party achieved success in Bihar (Bihar and Jharkhand). The Communist Party conducted movements for land reform, trade union movement was at its peak in Bihar in the sixties, seventies and eighties. Achievement of communists in Bihar placed the Communist Party in the forefront of left movement in India. Bihar produced some of the legendary leaders like Kishan leaders Sahajanand Saraswati and Karyanand Sharma, intellectual giants like Jagannath Sarkar, Yogendra Sharma, and Indradeep Sinha, mass leaders like Chandrasekhar Singh and Sunil Mukherjee, Trade Union leaders like Kedar Das and others. In the Mithila region of Bihar Bhogendra Jha led the fight against the Mahants and Zamindars. He later went on the win Parliamentary elections and was MP for seven terms.

In the early 1950s, young communist leadership was uniting textile workers, bank employees and unorganised sector workers to ensure mass support in north India. National leaders like S. A. Dange, Chandra Rajeswara Rao, and P. K. Vasudevan Nair were encouraging them and supporting the idea despite their differences on the execution. Firebrand Communist leaders like Homi F. Daji, Guru Radha Kishan, H. L. Parwana, Sarjoo Pandey, Darshan Singh Canadian and Avtaar Singh Malhotra were emerging between the masses and the working class in particular. This was the first leadership of communists that was very close to the masses and people consider them champions of the cause of the workers and the poor.

In 1952, CPI became the first leading opposition party in the 1st Lok Sabha, while the Indian National Congress was in power.

In the 1952 Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly election, the Communist Party was banned, so it couldn&#x27;t take part in the election process. In the general elections in 1957, the CPI emerged as the largest opposition party. In 1957, the CPI won the state elections in Kerala. This was the first time that an opposition party won control over an Indian state. E. M. S. Namboodiripad became Chief Minister. At the 1957 international meeting of Communist parties in Moscow, the Chinese Communist Party directed criticism at the CPI for having formed a ministry in Kerala.

&quot;Liberation of Dadra-Nagar Haveli&quot;:
The Communist Party of India, along with its units in Bombay, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, decided to start armed operations in the area in the July 1954. Both the areas were liberated by the beginning of August. Communist leaders like Narayan Palekar, Parulekar, Vaz, Rodriguez, Cunha, and others emerged as the famous Communist leaders of this movement. Thereafter, the struggle to liberate Daman and Diu was begun by the Communist Party in Gujarat and other forces.

&quot;Goa Satyagraha&quot;:
The countrywide Goa satyagraha of 1955–1956 is among the unforgettable pages in the history of freedom struggle, in which the communists played a major and memorable role. The CPI decided to send batches of satyahrahis since the middle of 1955 to the borders of Goa and even inside. Many were killed, many more others arrested and sent to jails inside Goa and inhumanly treated. Many others were even sent to jails in Portugal and were brutally tortured.
The satyagraha was led and conducted by a joint committee known as Goa Vimochan Sahayak Samiti. S. A. Dange, Senapati Bapat, S. G. Sardesai, Nana Patil and several others were among the prominent leaders of the Samiti. Satyagraha began on 10 May 1955, and soon became a countrywide movement.

Ideological differences led to the split in the party in 1964 when two different party conferences were held, one of CPI and one of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

During the period between 1970 and 1977, the CPI was allied with the Congress party. In Kerala, they formed a government together with Congress as part of a coalition known as the United Front, with the CPI-leader C. Achutha Menon as Chief Minister. This government continued governing throughout the emergency period and was responsible for the many acts of repression throughout the period carried out against political opponents in the guise of fighting naxals, manifesting most infamously in the Rajan case. The United Front government also used this opportunity to pursue class struggle by punishing those from the managerial classes, money lenders, bosses with anti-labour stances, ration shopkeepers and truckers engaged in black marketing, under stringent provisions of MISA and DIR.

In the 1980s, the CPI opposed the Khalistan movement at Punjab.

In 1986, the CPI&#x27;s leader in Punjab and MLA in the Punjabi legislature Darshan Singh Canadian was assassinated by Sikh extremists. Altogether about 200 communist leaders out of which most were Sikhs were killed by Sikh extremists in Punjab.

==Present situation==

The CPI was recognised by the Election Commission of India as a &#x27;National Party&#x27;. Until 2022, CPI happened to be the only national political party from India to have contested all the general elections using the same electoral symbol. Owing to a massive defeat in 2019 Indian general election where the party saw its tally reduced to two MPs, the Election Commission of India sent a letter to CPI asking for reasons why its national party status should not be revoked. Due to repeated poor performances in elections, the Election Commission of India withdrew its national party status on 10 April 2023.

On the national level, they supported the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government along with other parliamentary Left parties, but without taking part in it. Upon attaining power in May 2004, the United Progressive Alliance formulated a programme of action known as the Common Minimum Programme. The Left bases its support to the UPA on strict adherence to it. Provisions of the CMP mentioned to discontinue disinvestment, massive social sector outlays and an independent foreign policy.

On 8 July 2008, the General Secretary of the CPI(M), Prakash Karat, announced that the Left was withdrawing its support over the decision by the government to go ahead with the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. The Left parties combination had been a staunch advocate of not proceeding with this deal citing national interests.

In West Bengal, the CPI participates in the Left Front. It also participated in the state government in Manipur. In Kerala, the party is part of Left Democratic Front. In Tripura the party is a partner of the Left Front, which governed the state until 2018. In Tamil Nadu it is part of the Secular Progressive Alliance and in Bihar it is the part of Mahagathbandhan. It is involved in the Left Democratic Front in Maharashtra. In February 2022, CPI and Congress formed an alliance in Manipur named Manipur Progressive Secular Alliance. The current general secretary of CPI is D. Raja.

==Presence in states==
As of 2020, the CPI is a part of the state government in Kerala. Pinarayi Vijayan is Chief Minister of Kerala. CPI have four Cabinet Ministers in Kerala. In Tamil Nadu, it is in power with SPA coalition led by M. K. Stalin. The Left Front governed West Bengal for 34 years (1977–2011) and Tripura for 25 years (1993–2018)

<text>Yeadon is a town within the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

Most of the town is in the Otley and Yeadon ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. A southern part of the town, north of Swincar Avenue on Kirk Lane and south of the A65 is in the Guiseley and Rawdon ward and the Pudsey constituency.

Leeds Bradford International Airport is immediately east of the town.

==History==
===Early times===
Yeadon&#x27;s name comes from Old English and meaning &quot;steep hill&quot;, and the hilly part of the High Street has been known as &quot;the Steep&quot; for centuries. It was one of three hill settlements: Rawdon, Yeadon and Baildon, and it has been suggested that Rawdon was the main one, Yeadon being used for burial (there are burial urns nearby) and other religious purposes.

===Medieval Period===
Yeadon was part of the Kingdom of Elmet until overrun by the Anglo-Saxons who transferred religion to Guiseley by building a church and divided Yeadon into two areas, Yeadon and Nether Yeadon, with Saxon lords (thegns). It remained divided until 1630. Following the Danish conquest of Yorkshire Yeadon was part of the Wapentake of Skyrack but still with Saxon lords.

After the Norman conquest the two manors were taken from their Saxon lords and given to the House of Percy (present Yeadon village) and the Meschines family (Nether Yeadon). According to the Domesday book it comprised four carucates or about 328 acres. Much of the area was later acquired by Bolton Priory and Kirkstall Abbey who exerted considerable power until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1354 the villagers won a court case against Kirkstall Abbey over 300 acres of moorland between Yeadon Tarn (lake) and Horsforth, which now accommodates Leeds Bradford Airport.
In this period there were only thirty or so households scattered around three points: where the town centre is now; the main cluster round where the Woolpack is, and a smaller group of cottages further to the west along Yeadon Gill at Nether Yeadon, probably a marketplace. Sheep were farmed and the wool made into cloth locally. Yeadon Gill provided water power for a corn mill.

===Later history===

Despite the English Civil War the area prospered and the population more than doubled to more than 400 during the 17th century, with 93 hearths (i.e. fireplace with chimney) recorded. Medieval parcels of land were traded into more efficient farms and a new mill was built. The town was no longer divided and had a significant social organization with poor relief and a constable.
The 18th century saw the establishment of a school (now Layton Cottage) and more stone houses were built replacing the wattle and daub cottages, a windmill and the first steam engine operated mill were built. The people worshipped at the parish church in Guiseley, some distance away, and started demanding their own church in 1714: but did not get one until 1844.

John Yeadon (1764–1833), a lay preacher in the town for more than thirty years, kept a journal about his life, family and events in the locality for most of his adult life. He and his wife, Mary had fourteen children, one of whom had a severe intellectual disability. John conducted services locally, but also in many villages and towns in the Aire and Wharfe Valleys. He attended services conducted by John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, many times. The handwritten journal provides detailed insights into town life and the early Methodist Church in the district.
In the 19th century, the population rose rapidly from 1,695 in 1801 to 4,109 in 1851 and 7,396 in 1891 as Yeadon became a manufacturing rather than farming town. It was particularly noted for making women&#x27;s apparel. To assist trade, New Road (now A65) was built in 1827 through Yeadon, linking Kirkstall with Guiseley and the railway followed in the 1840s. In 1845 it was administratively separated from Guiseley. By 1853 it had gas from the &quot;Yeadon and Guiseley Gas Light Co&quot;. The watercourse became badly polluted by effluent from Bradford, Shipley and Bingley, leading to a successful court case against Bradrod Corporation in 1868. The Yeadon Waterworks sank a well in 1861 and began the Cold Harbour Reservoir in 1877. The town&#x27;s Board of Health was established in 1863, and set up the cemetery and buildings in 1876. In 1880 the town had its own &quot;Yeadon Town Hall and Mechanics&#x27; Institute&quot;.

===20th century onwards===
Increasing social unrest and labour disputes in the early 20th century led to a major lockout and subsequent hunger marches in 1913. As a result of the dispute, the working week in the textile mills was shortened, and workers received a pay rise, although this fell short of the demands of the trade unions who in consequence streamlined their organisation. In 1937 it became part of the Aireborough district, being the most populous township of over ten thousand.

==Geography==
The main part of the town is on a hill with a south facing slope towards the Aire valley. It is bounded by the A65 road to the southwest and the A658 road to the southeast. South of the junction of these roads are Nether Yeadon and Little London. To the west of the A65 is New Scarborough, containing many 19th century houses. A public park, Nunroyd Park, to the northwest provides a green break between the housing of Yeadon and Guiseley. This was formerly the house and lands of a mill owner, and before that the parkland belonging to a nunnery, &quot;royd&quot; meaning a woodland clearing.

Evidence of the medieval settlement is seen in fields to the north in Yeadon Banks which follow the strips of this time, and in the irregular and organic location of buildings around Town Street and Ivegate, described in 1878, as &quot;a bewildering labyrinth of yards and courts and intricate lanes&quot;. By contrast the 19th century development produced a regular grid of terraced houses, many of which remain, while the pattern of streets remains for those that have gone. There are also a number of former mill and dyeworks sites.

The geology is sandstone and millstone grit, which has been extensively quarried and used for buildings, and impervious shale and clay to the north, which allowed the formation of a natural hilltop lake, Yeadon Tarn, which was enlarged for industrial use. Leeds Bradford Airport occupies the high plateau of Yeadon Moor to the east. In chronostratigraphy, the term Yeadonian—for a British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period—is derived from the study of a geological site at the brick and tile works in Yeadon.

==Public transport==
Yeadon had a rail connection from Guiseley that opened in 1894. The line was closed in 1964. It is now a nature path and most of its length can still be walked, from the Old Engine Fields, off Henshaw Lane, past Guiseley retail park where it joined the Guiseley Branch Line. The line continued over Henshaw Lane where an old bridge can still be seen. Immediately after the bridge was the railway station, near the Station Inn in the (now) council storage yard. The line terminated opposite Trinity Church (previously Benton Congregational Church) in Rawdon. Yeadon Station was mostly used for goods, and the line served several large mills directly along its route (Leafield Mill, Kirk Lane Mill, Westfield Mill, Green Lane Mill, a soap works and a dye works). The only passenger trains were special services. The first train to leave Yeadon Station in 1905 held 500 people. The following year, trains took passengers from Yeadon to Blackpool. The nearest railway station is at , to the north-west.

Yeadon (Green Lane) was connected by tram to Leeds from 1909 until the 1950s. Northbound, Yeadon is served by bus route A2 to Harrogate, 33, 34 and 27 to Otley and Guiseley respectively, and the 966 to Guiseley. Southbound, the town is served by the A2 to Bradford via Greengates, the A3 to Bradford via Shipley, 33, 34 and 27 to Leeds

==Religion==
Yeadon was part of the old, large Guiseley Parish but a church, St John the Evangelist Church, was built in 1844 as a Commissioners&#x27; church with a grant of £300. It was designed by Walker Rawsthorne. Its tower was demolished as unsafe in 1970. The New Life Community Church was formerly St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church (C of E), built by Thomas Healey of Bradford in 1891 and is Grade II listed. There is a Roman Catholic church (St Peter and St Paul), a Methodist church developed from a Primitive Methodist Chapel, and a meeting hall for Plymouth Brethren.
==Notable features==
===Town Hall===

Facing north on Town Hall Square by the High Street, the Yeadon Town Hall and Mechanics&#x27; Institute of 1880 was designed by William Hill of Leeds. It is a Grade II listed building of coursed dressed sandstone, with slate roofs in French Gothic style, with a central tower with a clock. The architect was selected after a competition with more than 200 entries, with a budget of £5,000. The stonemason was Richard Hogg of Rawdon.

The building was used as a registrar&#x27;s office in the Yorkshire Television programme &quot;The Beiderbecke Tapes&quot; in 1985.

===Low Hall===

Arthur Mee wrote &quot;Though Yorkshire has many greater houses, it has few more charming than Low Hall on the fringe of Yeadon.&quot; It is a Grade II listed building on Gill Lane, a former 17th century farmhouse (with a datestone &quot;W S 1658&quot;), remodelled in the 19th century, of coursed sandstone and slate roof. It was built in 1624, and has a porch added by William Sale in 1658, the stone believed to be taken from Esholt Priory following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It contains a Tudor priest hole.

===Yeadon Tarn===
Yeadon Tarn, also known as Yeadon Dam, between High Street and the airport runway was drained during the Second World War to prevent enemy aircraft using its reflection as a landmark to identify the nearby Avro factory.
The tarn is used for sailing and fishing. Mallard ducks, swans and a sizable population of Canada geese can be found at the tarn. Adjacent to the tarn is a park of with a BMX bike track, known as Tarnfield Park.

==Governance==
Yeadon was formerly a township and chapelry, in 1866 Yeadon became a separate civil parish, in 1894 Yeadon became an urban district, on 1 April 1937 the district was abolished to form Aireborough, part also went to the County Borough of Bradford. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Aireborough, part also went to Idle. In 1931 the parish had a population of 7672.

Yeadon, along with neighbouring towns Guiseley and Rawdon formed part of Aireborough Urban District from 1937 to 1974. Yeadon still hosts local Rugby Union side Aireborough RUFC at Nunroyd Park. Yeadon (except for the area north of Swincar Avenue on Kirk Lane, and the area south of the A65) is now in the Leeds City Council Ward of Otley and Yeadon ward. It is represented by three councillors. Leeds City Council now control the public services in Yeadon. Yeadon falls into Leeds North West constituency, which is held by the Labour Party, represented by Katie White.

==Amenities==
Yeadon has a developed town centre and most of the businesses are situated around the High Street. There is a Morrisons supermarket and several other chain shops, such as KC&#x27;s Express (est. 1994). There are also building societies, estate agents and public houses. Travelodge and Premier Travel Inn hotels are situated near the airport.
In Town Hall Square there is a public library which is part of Leeds City Council&#x27;s library network. It also operates as a council One Stop Centre.

==Sports==
Cricket has been played in Yeadon at least since around 1850 when scores of people were reported to play on Yeadon Moor after work ended on a Saturday teatime. Play continued as long as the light would allow. The origins of cricket in Yeadon are not definitely known, but at that time Yeadon boasted two teams, Topenders and Lowenders. The teams decided to amalgamate at a meeting held in the Old Victoria Hotel, at the junction of Sandy Way and the Green in 1859. The club adopted the name Yeadon United Cricket Club, ‘united’ was dropped soon afterwards.

The legendary W. G. Grace played at the Swan ground in 1877 with a United South XI. Grace was bowled for nought by an elated bowler who was then admonished by his captain for removing the man the crowd had paid to see.

Yeadon Cricket Club plays in the Bradford Premier League with their 1XI in Division One and the 2XI in Division One (2nds) and the 3XI play in the Mid Yorkshire Sunday Cricket League, Championship after winning their Section in 2023.

Yeadon FC won promotion to the FA&#x27;s Wharfedale Triangle Premier League in the 2018–19 season.

==Economy==
The Avro factory next to Yeadon Aerodrome from 1938 to 1946 produced many of the company&#x27;s wartime planes, including the Lancaster, Lincoln, York and Anson. Several different variants of Lancasters were produced at Yeadon, with a final tally of 695.

Aviation heritage in Yeadon is kept alive by the activities of 2168 (Yeadon) Squadron Air Training Corps.

The national charity Epilepsy Action has its headquarters in the town.

<doc id="408219" wikidata="Q803681" url="?curid=408219" title="Bahujan Samaj Party">
<text>The Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP) is a political party in India that was formed to represent Bahujans (literally means &quot;community in majority&quot;), referring to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes (OBC), along with minorities. According to Kanshi Ram, when he founded the party in 1984, the Bahujans comprised 85 percent of India&#x27;s population, but were divided into 6,000 different castes. The party claims to be inspired by the philosophy of B. R. Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Narayana Guru, Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj, and Gautama Buddha.

Kanshi Ram named his protégée, Mayawati, as his successor in 2001. The BSP has its main base in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh where it was the second-largest party in the 2019 Indian general election with 19.3% of votes and fourth largest in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election with 12.88% of votes. Its election symbol is an elephant which is the same symbol historically used by Dr. Ambedkar&#x27;s Scheduled Castes Federation.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Bahujan&quot; is a Sanskritic term found in Hindu and Buddhist texts, and literally refers to &quot;many people&quot;, or &quot;the majority&quot;. It connotes the combined population of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Muslims, and minorities who together constitute the demographic majority of India. The word &quot;Bahujan&quot; appears in the dictum &quot;Bahujana Hitaya Bahujana Sukhaya&quot;, or &quot;The benefit and prosperity of the many&quot;, articulated by Gautama Buddha.

In his writing, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar used the term to refer to the majority of people in society that experienced discrimination and oppression on the basis of caste. Jyotirao Phule used the term in a similar context, and compared the Bahujans of India to Slavery in the United States. Schedule Caste and Bahujan writers have suggested this proportion was 70 percent of the population.

== History ==
Bahujan Samaj Party was founded on the birth anniversary of B. R. Ambedkar (14 April 1984) by Kanshi Ram, who named former school teacher, Mayawati, as his successor of BSP in 2001. The party&#x27;s power grew quickly with seats in the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh and the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India. In 1993, following the assembly elections, Mayawati formed a coalition with Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav as Chief Minister. On 2 June 1995, she withdrew support from his government, which led to a major incident where Mulayam Singh Yadav was accused of sending his zealots to keep her party legislators hostage at a Lucknow guest house and shout casteist abuses at her. Since this incident, they have regarded each other publicly as chief rivals. Mayawati then obtained support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to become Chief Minister on 3 June 1995. In October 1995, the BJP withdrew their support and fresh elections were called after a period of President&#x27;s Rule. In 2003, Mayawati resigned from her own government to prove that she was not &quot;hungry for power&quot; and asked the BJP-run Government of India to remove Union Tourism and Culture Minister, Jagmohan. In 2007, she began leading a BSP-formed government with an absolute majority for a full five-year term.

On 10 December 2023, Mayawati declared her nephew Akash Anand as the party&#x27;s successor. However, he was sacked immediately after his comments on the ruling BJP Party.

=== Silver jubilee ===
On 14 April 2009, the Bahujan Samaj Party celebrated its silver jubilee. The &quot;Manywar Shri Kanshi Ramji Shahri Garib Awas Yojna&quot; housing scheme for poor was launched by Lucknow Development Authority (LDA). The role of Mayawati was discussed in BSP&#x27;s success. A mass rally was organised in Lucknow with 10000 police personnel on duty. It was the 305th and largest rally of BSP since 1984. As per Observer Research Foundation, within 25 years BSP became the third largest political party of India.

== Views ==
BSP believes in &quot;Social Transformation and Economic Emancipation&quot; of the &quot;Bahujan Samaj&quot;. The Bahujan Samaj signifies the Bahujans as the Scheduled Castes (SC), the Scheduled Tribes (ST), and the Other Backward Castes (OBC). B. R. Ambedkar, a proponent of Bahujan rights, is their important ideological inspiration. The BSP also speaks in favor of religious minorities. The party claims not to be prejudiced against upper-caste Hindus. In 2008, while addressing the audience, Mayawati said: &quot;Our policies and ideology are not against any particular caste or religion. If we were anti-upper caste, we would not have given tickets to candidates from upper castes to contest elections&quot;.

== Electoral performances ==

=== Success in 2007 ===
The results of the May 2007 Uttar Pradesh state assembly election saw the BSP emerge as a sole majority party, the first to do so since 1991. Mayawati began her fourth term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and took her oath of office along with 50 ministers of cabinet and state rank on 13 May 2007, at Rajbhawan in the state capital of Lucknow. Most importantly, the majority achieved in large part was due to the party&#x27;s ability to take away majority of upper castes votes from their traditional party, the BJP.

The party could manage only 80 seats in 2012, as opposed to 206 in 2007 assembly elections. BSP government was the first in the history of Uttar Pradesh to complete its full five-year term. On 26 May 2018, Ram Achal Rajbhar was replaced by R S Kushwaha as the president of UP unit.

=== 2014 Lok Sabha elections ===
The 2014 national Lok Sabha elections saw the BSP become the third-largest national party of India in terms of vote percentage, having 4.2% of the vote across the country but gaining no seats.

=== 2019 Lok Sabha elections: Mahagathbandhan===
Prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BSP formed an alliance. The &quot;Mahagathbandhan&quot; (or Grand Alliance), or simply the &quot;Gathbandhan&quot; (Alliance), is an anti-Congress, anti-BJP Indian political alliance formed in the run-up to the 2019 general election under the leadership of two former Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati of the Bahujan Samaj Party, along with Ajit Singh&#x27;s Rashtriya Lok Dal and several other political parties, contesting in different states of India.

In Uttar Pradesh, BSP contested 38 seats, SP 37, and RLD 3, and the alliance supported Congress in the final two. Due to this seat sharing agreement, BSP&#x27;s vote share fell slightly nationally and in the state, but they won 10 seats, up from 0 in 2014. The Samajwadi Party won 5 seats, giving the alliance a total of 15 seats out of 80 in the state.

=== 2024 Lok Sabha elections: Historic setback ===
On 19 July 2023, the BSP had announced that it would neither side with the INDIA nor the NDA and would go alone in the 2024 Indian General Election. However, it had its worst performance in a Lok Sabha election. It lost all ten of its seats in Uttar Pradesh that it had gained in the previous election and didn&#x27;t gain any seats elsewhere. Its national vote share fell to 2.07%, less than half of what it was in 2014 when it also won 0 seats.

<text>Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin (July 24, 1944 – June 4, 2018) was an American poet and musician. He was one of the founding members of The Last Poets, a group of poets and musicians that evolved in the 1960s out of the Harlem Writers Workshop in New York City.

He was born Lawrence Padilla in Fort Greene in Brooklyn, New York, USA. Earlier in his career he used the names Lightnin&#x27; Rod and Alafia Pudim. He is sometimes called &quot;The Grandfather of Rap&quot;.

A devout Muslim, poet, acupuncturist, and martial art exponent (a practitioner of a form of Bak Mei), Nuriddin&#x27;s talent and genius with words and rhythm are renowned and he produced some epic poems such as &quot;Be-Yon-Der&quot;, an 18-minute piece on The Last Poets 1977 album &quot;Delights of the Garden&quot;, which was originally released on Douglas Records, and later on Celluloid Records.

==Early life==

Jalal Mansur Nuriddin grew up in Fort Greene, a neighborhood of project buildings near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Running with a local gang, the Fort Greene Chaplains, they fought a street rivalry with the Bed-Stuy Bishops, from further up on Myrtle Avenue, which ran through both neighborhoods. He was incarcerated during this period.

He was given early release on condition that he join the US Army, where he trained as a paratrooper but was imprisoned again within the Army for refusing to salute the American flag. He did, however, receive an honourable discharge and went to work for a bank on Wall Street. It was his experience there that spawned his poem &quot;E-Pluribus Unum&quot;, from 1973&#x27;s &quot;Chastisement&quot;. Nuriddin converted to Islam while in jail and in 2003 went on a pilgrimage to Mecca. While in jail he learned to spiel, an early form of rap, which he called &quot;spoagraphics&quot; or &quot;spoken pictures&quot;. It was also known as toasting, which was a form of rhythmic spoken poetry accompanied by &quot;ad hoc&quot; percussion by prison inmates, such as the famous Signified Monkey toast popularised by comedian Dolemite (not to be confused with the &quot;toast&quot; of Jamaican DJs, which is more reggae than rap).

==The Last Poets==

Nuriddin joined the first version of The Last Poets, with members Gylan Kain, David Nelson, and Felipe Luciano, but left before the trio recorded and released their only album, &quot;Right On&quot;, in 1967, the soundtrack to a documentary movie of the same name. As he informed them of the intention to form his own group called The Last Poets, the &quot;Right On&quot; album was released under the name The Original Last Poets.

Together with Umar Bin Hassan and the late Nilja, their percussionist, he released in 1969 the self-titled first album &quot;The Last Poets&quot;, followed in 1970 by &quot;This Is Madness&quot;. In 1971, that follow-up album landed the group on President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Cointelpro radicals list targeted for surveillance by the FBI. At the time, his name was still credited as Alafia Pudim, but he later changed it to the Islamic name (Jalaluddin – The Glory of the Faith, Mansur – Victorious, Nuriddin – The Light of the Faith) by which he is known today. Nuriddin&#x27;s fellow poet and friend the late Suleiman El-Hadi replaced Nilja on the third album, &quot;Chastisement&quot;, and also recorded 1974&#x27;s &quot;At Last&quot; (the only recording to include Nuriddin, Bin Hassan, and El-Hadi together). Altogether, there were six albums released by the Nuriddin / El-Hadi &quot;mach two&quot; edition of the Poets, culminating with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Scatterap/Home&quot;. Later members included Kenyatte Abdur-Rahman, composer and vibraphonist (who died in November 2015) on the album &quot;Scatterap/Home&quot;, and Abu Mustafa (also deceased).

&quot;Lightnin&#x27; Rod&quot; was the pseudonym of Nuriddin when he released his seminal 1973 &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot; LP, featuring tracks including &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;Spoon&quot; and &quot;Coppin&#x27; Some Fronts for the Set&quot;. The album was released on United Artists and featured Tina Turner and The Ikettes, Bernard Purdie, Billy Preston, Cornell Dupree, and Kool and the Gang. Most of the lyrics deal with the way of life in ghettos, i.e. hustling, drugs, gambling and money with the outcome being a shoot out with the cops followed by jail where the hustlers learn &quot;The whole truth&quot;. A sequel, &quot;The Hustlers Detention&quot; is purportedly in the pipeline with the final part being &quot;The Hustlers Ascension&quot;. &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot; has been sampled by many hip-hop artists; producer Ron Saint Germain had declared it to be &quot;one of the most stolen and sampled albums ever made&quot;.

In April 2008, Nuriddin reunited and reconciled with fellow Last Poets Umar Bin Hassan and Abiodun Oyewole, along with David Nelson and Felipe Luciano, all of whom appear in &quot;Made in Amerikkka&quot;, a documentary by French film-maker Claude Santiago. Bin Hassan recalled in a &quot;Billboard&quot; article how the fiery and passionate Last Poets in the 1970s said things they should not have said: &quot;we were all young men, 19, 20 years old. What do we know, really, about the world, about ourselves, America, race relations?&quot;

Nuriddin made an album for Adrian Sherwood. and the single &quot;Mankind, Pt. 2&quot;, produced by Skip McDonald and released on Sherwood&#x27;s label On-U Sound, can be heard over the closing credits of the film &quot;187&quot;.

Nuriddin and the Last Poets also had a cameo appearance in John Singleton&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur.

==2004–2018==
In 2004, Nuriddin wrote the foreword to Malik Al Nasir&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Ordinary Guy&quot;, published under Malik&#x27;s pre-Islamic name Mark T. Watson in the UK by Fore-Word Press. Nuriddin was also featured in the documentary &quot;Word Up – From Ghetto to Mecca&quot;, along with poets Gil Scott Heron, Mark T. Watson a.k.a. Malik Al Nasir, Rod Youngs (Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s Amnesia Express) and dub poet Benjamin Zephaniah, where he discussed the significance of the spoken word as an extension of the African oral tradition, as well as the origins of rap and the work of his student and friend Malik Al Nasir. In the film Nuriddin recites from Al Nasir&#x27;s book &quot;Ordinary Guy&quot; the poem he wrote as a foreword to it, called &quot;Malik&#x27;s Mode&quot;. Nuriddin also later recorded &quot;Malik&#x27;s Mode&quot; with Al Nasir&#x27;s band &quot;Malik &amp; the O.G&#x27;s&quot; for the album &quot;Rhythms of the Diaspora Vol&#x27;s 1 &amp; 2&quot; at Mercredi 9 Studios in Paris, while filming the &quot;Word Up&quot; documentary. The album &quot;Rhythms of the Diaspora Vol&#x27;s 1 &amp; 2&quot; was released on August 1, 2015, on Mentis Records in the UK.

Nuriddin returned to the UK in 2014 to perform live the seminal solo album &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot;, credited as being the first ever rap album live at the Jazz Café in Camden Town, London. The event was produced by Fore-Word Press for Riverhorse Communications, who filmed it as part of a documentary on the forgotten roots of rap called &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot;. The executive producer is Public Enemy&#x27;s front man Chuck D. The film &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot;, directed by Mike Todd, premiered at Docfest in Sheffield, UK, in 2015, with its London premiere at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, on June 14, 2015. The &quot;Hustlers Convention Live&quot; featured The Jazz Warriors International Collective, Malik &amp; the O.G&#x27;s and poet Lemn Sissay. The UK DVD release of the historical &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot; was in 2015. After the film premiered in the UK at Docfest 2015 it went on general release throughKaleidoscope and premiered in New York at TriBeca Film Festival 2015 for its USA cinema release. Nuriddin screened the film also in Canada in 2016 as part of a tour with UK poet Malik Al Nasir called &quot;The Revolution Will Be Live&quot;, comprising seminars, poetry performances, school visits, workshops and joint screenings of Al Nasir&#x27;s film also featuring Nuriddin, called &quot;Word-Up&quot;.

Jalal died after a long battle with cancer on June 4, 2018.

<doc id="408223" wikidata="Q1036307" url="?curid=408223" title="High Gear (Howe II album)">
<text>High Gear is the first studio album by the American hard rock band Howe II, released in 1989 through Shrapnel Records. Howe II was a short-lived group fronted by guitarist Greg Howe and his brother Albert Howe on vocals.

==Critical reception==
Andy Hinds at AllMusic reviewed the album positively, saying that &quot;The songs on &quot;High Gear&quot; are good, the riffs are killer, and the execution is flawless.&quot; He praised Greg Howe&#x27;s guitar playing as &quot;more effective than ever; focused like a laser, his brilliant solos drive home the point of the songs rather than being the point of the songs&quot; and likened Albert Howe&#x27;s vocals to David Lee Roth. More praise went to the band overall: &quot;The entire band plays with an articulate, inspired precision and energy that is truly awesome.&quot; Journalist Martin Popoff described the album as &quot;a rhythmic good time metal party&quot; and the production as &quot;a bit blocky, but vital like Van Halen&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, specifically complex analysis, the principal values of a multivalued function are the values along one chosen branch of that function, so that it is single-valued. A simple case arises in taking the square root of a positive real number. For example, 4 has two square roots: 2 and −2; of these the positive root, 2, is considered the principal root and is denoted as formula_1

==Motivation==
Consider the complex logarithm function . It is defined as the complex number such that
:formula_2
Now, for example, say we wish to find . This means we want to solve
:formula_3 
for formula_4. The value formula_5 is a solution.

However, there are other solutions, which is evidenced by considering the position of in the complex plane and in particular its argument formula_6. We can rotate counterclockwise formula_7 radians from 1 to reach initially, but if we rotate further another formula_8 we reach again. So, we can conclude that formula_9 is &quot;also&quot; a solution for . It becomes clear that we can add any multiple of formula_8 to our initial solution to obtain all values for .

But this has a consequence that may be surprising in comparison of real valued functions: does not have one definite value. For , we have
:formula_11
for an integer , where is the (principal) argument of defined to lie in the interval formula_12. Each value of determines what is known as a &quot;branch&quot; (or &quot;sheet&quot;), a single-valued component of the multiple-valued log function. When the focus is on a single branch, sometimes a branch cut is used; in this case removing the non-positive real numbers from the domain of the function and eliminating formula_13 as a possible value for . With this branch cut, the single-branch function is continuous and analytic everywhere in its domain.

The branch corresponding to is known as the &quot;principal branch&quot;, and along this branch, the values the function takes are known as the &quot;principal values&quot;.

==General case==
In general, if is multiple-valued, the principal branch of is denoted
:formula_14
such that for in the domain of , is single-valued.

===Principal values of standard functions===
Complex valued elementary functions can be multiple-valued over some domains. The principal value of some of these functions can be obtained by decomposing the function into simpler ones whereby the principal value of the simple functions are straightforward to obtain.

====Logarithm function====
We have examined the logarithm function above, i.e., 
:formula_15
Now, is intrinsically multivalued. One often defines the argument of some complex number to be between formula_16 (exclusive) and formula_13 (inclusive), so we take this to be the principal value of the argument, and we write the argument function on this branch (with the leading capital A). Using instead of , we obtain the principal value of the logarithm, and we write
:formula_18

====Square root====
For a complex number formula_19 the principal value of the square root is:

:formula_20

with argument formula_21 Sometimes a branch cut is introduced so that negative real numbers are not in the domain of the square root function and eliminating the possibility that formula_22

====Inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions====
Inverse trigonometric functions (, , , etc.) and inverse hyperbolic functions (, , , etc.) can be defined in terms of logarithms and their principal values can be defined in terms of the principal values of the logarithm.

====Complex argument====
The principal value of complex number argument measured in radians can be defined as:
* values in the range formula_23
* values in the range formula_24

For example, many computing systems include an  function. The value of will be in the interval formula_25 In comparison, is typically in formula_26

<doc id="408230" wikidata="Q505119" url="?curid=408230" title="Blockbuster (entertainment)">
<text>A blockbuster is a work of entertainment—typically used to describe a feature film produced by a major film studio, but also other media—that is highly popular and financially successful. The term has also come to refer to any large-budget production &quot;intended&quot; for &quot;blockbuster&quot; status, aimed at mass markets with associated merchandising, sometimes on a scale that meant the financial fortunes of a film studio or a distributor could depend on it.

==Etymology==
The term began to appear in the American press in the early 1940s, referring to the blockbuster bombs, aerial munitions capable of destroying a whole block of buildings. Its first known use in reference to films was in May 1943, when advertisements in &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; described the RKO film, &quot;Bombardier&quot;, as &quot;The block-buster of all action-thrill-service shows!&quot; Another trade advertisement in 1944 boasted that the war documentary, &quot;With the Marines at Tarawa&quot;, &quot;hits the heart like a two ton blockbuster.&quot;

Several theories have been put forward for the origin of the term in a film context. One explanation pertains to the practice of &quot;block booking&quot; whereby a studio would sell a package of films to theaters, rather than permitting them to select which films they wanted to exhibit. However, this practice was outlawed in 1948 before the term became common parlance; while pre-1948 high-grossing big-budget spectacles may be retroactively labelled &quot;blockbusters,&quot; this is not how they were known at the time. Another explanation is that trade publications would often advertise the popularity of a film by including illustrations showing long queues often extending around the block, but in reality the term was never used in this way. The term was actually first coined by publicists who drew on readers&#x27; familiarity with the blockbuster bombs, drawing an analogy with the bomb&#x27;s huge impact. The trade press subsequently appropriated the term as short-hand for a film&#x27;s commercial potential. Throughout 1943 and 1944 the term was applied to films such as &quot;Bataan&quot;, &quot;No Time for Love&quot; and &quot;Brazil&quot;.

==History==

===Golden Age era===
The term fell out of usage in the aftermath of World War II but was revived in 1948 by &quot;Variety&quot; in an article about big budget films. By the early 1950s the term had become standardised within the film industry and the trade press to denote a film that was large in spectacle, scale and cost, that would go on to achieve a high gross. In December 1950 the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; predicted that &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; would be &quot;a box office block buster&quot;, and in November 1951 &quot;Variety&quot; described &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; as &quot;a b.o. blockbuster [...] right up there with &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; for boxoffice performance [...] a super-spectacle in all its meaning&quot;.

According to Stephen Prince, Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; had a &quot;racing, powerful narrative engine, breathtaking pacing, and sense-assaulting visual style&quot; (what he calls a &quot;kinesthetic cinema&quot; approach to &quot;action filmmaking and exciting visual design&quot;) that was &quot;the clearest precursor&quot; and became &quot;the model for&quot; the &quot;visceral&quot; Hollywood blockbuster &quot;brand of moviemaking&quot; that emerged in the 1970s. According to Prince, Kurosawa became &quot;a mentor figure&quot; to a generation of emerging American filmmakers who went on to develop the Hollywood blockbuster format in the 1970s, such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.

===Blockbuster era===
====1970s====
In 1975, the usage of &quot;blockbuster&quot; for films coalesced around Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;. It was perceived as a new cultural phenomenon: fast-paced, exciting entertainment, inspiring interest and conversation beyond the theatre (which would later be called &quot;buzz&quot;), and repeated viewings. The film is regarded as the first film of the &quot;blockbuster era&quot;, and founded the blockbuster film genre. Two years later, &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded on the success of &quot;Jaws&quot;, setting box office records and enjoying a theatrical run that lasted more than a year. After the success of &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, many Hollywood producers attempted to create similar &quot;event&quot; films with wide commercial appeal, and film companies began green-lighting increasingly large-budget films, and relying extensively on massive advertising blitzes leading up to their theatrical release. These two films were the prototypes for the &quot;summer blockbuster&quot; trend, in which major film studios and distributors planned their annual marketing strategy around a big release by July 4. Alongside other films from the New Hollywood era, George Lucas&#x27;s 1973 hit &quot;American Graffiti&quot; is often cited for helping give birth to the summer blockbuster.

====1980s–1990s====
The next fifteen years saw a number of high-quality blockbusters released including the likes of &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and its sequel, &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), the first three &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films (1981, 1984 and 1989), &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy (1985, 1989 and 1990), &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and its sequel &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) and &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995).

====21st century====
Some examples of summer blockbusters from the 2000s include &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006), &quot;Transformers&quot; (2007) and &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008)—all of which founded successful franchises—and originals like &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), &quot;Ice Age&quot; (2002), &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004) and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008) and &quot;Up&quot; (2009). The superhero genre saw renewed interest with &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000), &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) and its sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) all proving to be very popular.

Blockbusters in the 2010s include &quot;Inception&quot; (2010), &quot;Despicable Me&quot; (2010), &quot;Ted&quot; (2012), &quot;The Conjuring&quot; (2013), &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017). Several established franchises continued to spawn successful entries with &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011), &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019) and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) and &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018) alongside animated originals &quot;Zootopia&quot; (2016) and &quot;Inside Out&quot; (2015). Several older franchises were successfully resurrected by &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), &quot;Jurassic World&quot; (2015), &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2014) and its sequel &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2017). The most successful franchise of the decade was arguably Disney&#x27;s Marvel Cinematic Universe, particularly &quot;The Avengers&quot; series.

The following decade, Hollywood saw blockbusters, such as &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023), &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), &quot;&quot; (2022), &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), &quot;&quot; (2022), &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; (2024) and Greta Gerwig&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023) alongside several older franchises that were successfully resurrected like &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (2022) and &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024).

==Criticism==
Eventually, the focus on creating blockbusters grew so intense that a backlash occurred, with some critics and film-makers decrying the prevalence of a &quot;blockbuster mentality&quot;, lamenting the death of the author-driven, &quot;more artistic&quot; small-scale films of the New Hollywood era. This view is taken, for example, by film journalist Peter Biskind, who wrote that all studios wanted was another &quot;Jaws&quot;, and as production costs rose, they were less willing to take risks, and therefore based blockbusters on the &quot;lowest common denominators&quot; of the mass market. In his 2006 book &quot;The Long Tail&quot;, Chris Anderson talks about blockbuster films, stating that a society that is hit-driven, and makes way and room for only those films that are expected to be a hit, is in fact a limited society. In 1998, writer David Foster Wallace posited that films are subject to an inverse cost and quality law.&lt;ref name=&quot;F/X&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Biskind&#x27;s book &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot; argues that the New Hollywood movement marked a significant shift towards independently produced and innovative works by a new wave of directors, but that this shift began to reverse itself when the commercial success of &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; led to the realization by studios of the importance of blockbusters, advertising and control over production (even though the success of &quot;The Godfather&quot; was said to be the precursor to the blockbuster phenomenon).

<text>The Party of Functional Groups (), often known by its abbreviation Golkar, is a centre-right big tent secular nationalist political party in Indonesia. Founded in 1964 as the Joint Secretariat of Functional Groups (, Sekber Golkar), it is the oldest extant political party in Indonesia. It first participated in national elections in 1971 as Functional Groups. Since 2009, it has been the second-largest party in the House of Representatives (DPR), having won 102 seats in the latest election.

Golkar was the ruling political group during the New Order government of Suharto from 1971 to 1999, when it was required to become a political party in order to contest elections. In the ensuing legislative election, its share of votes declined. Golkar then joined the governing coalitions of Presidents Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri. It regained its position as the largest party in the DPR after winning the 2004 legislative election, and its member Jusuf Kalla was elected as vice president. In 2009, Golkar nominated Kalla for president, but he was defeated by the incumbent Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY). When Joko Widodo (Jokowi) was elected president in 2014, Golkar initially joined the opposing coalition led by Prabowo Subianto, but in 2016, switched its allegiance to the Jokowi administration.

In 2024, Golkar finished second in the legislative election and gained 102 seats, the party&#x27;s best performance following a trend of declining seats since 2009. The party also remains in government as part of the governing Advanced Indonesia Coalition. For 53 years, Golkar has continued to be in government, whether it be as the sole ruling party, or as a junior coalition partner.

==History==
===Origins===

In 1959, President Sukarno introduced his concept of Guided Democracy, in which so-called functional groups would play a role in government in place of political parties. The Indonesian National Armed Forces supported its creation because it believed these groups would balance the growing strength of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). In 1960, Sukarno awarded sectoral groups such as teachers, the Armed Forces and the Indonesian National Police, workers and artists seats in the Mutual Cooperation House of Representatives. As some of the members of these functional groups were linked to political parties, this gave political influence to the National Armed Forces and by extension the National Police. The TNI then established an anti-PKI trade union, the Central Organization of Indonesian Workers, or Soksi (&quot;Sentral Organisasi Karyawan Swadiri Indonesia&quot;), and used this as the core of an Armed Forces-led Joint Secretariat of Functional Groups, or Sekber Golkar, which was officially established on 20 October 1964. By 1968 there were almost 250 organisations under the Sekber umbrella. On 22 November 1969 they were organized into seven main organizations, or Kino (&quot;Kelompok Induk Organisasi&quot;), namely Soksi, Kosgoro (Union of Mutual Cooperation Multifunction Organizations), MKGR (Mutual Assistance Families Association), Gerakan Karya Rakyat (People&#x27;s Working Movement), Ormas Hankam (Defense and Security Mass Organizations), Professi (professional organizations), and Gerakan Pembangunan (Development Movement). The Joint Secretariat was one of those organisations moblized against the PKI in the aftermath of the failure of the 30 September Movement in 1965.

===Suharto and Golkar===
In March 1968, General Suharto was officially elected by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) as Indonesia&#x27;s second president. Because of his military background, Suharto was not affiliated with any political parties. Suharto had never expressed much interest in party politics. However, if he were to be elected for a second term as president, he needed to align himself with a political party. Originally, Suharto had shown interest in aligning with the Indonesian National Party (PNI), the party of his predecessor, Sukarno. But in seeking to distance himself from the old regime, Suharto settled on Golkar.

Suharto then ordered his closest associate, Ali Murtopo, to transform Golkar and turn it into an electoral machine. Under Murtopo, and with Suharto&#x27;s supervision, Golkar was turned from a federation of NGOs into a political party. Under Suharto, Golkar continued to portray itself as a non-ideological entity, without favoritism or political agendas. It promised to focus on &quot;economic development&quot; and &quot;stability&quot; rather than a specific ideological goal. Golkar also began identifying itself with the government, encouraging civil servants to vote for it as a sign of loyalty to the government.

Murtopo claimed that workers were a functional group, which by rights ought to be subsumed under Golkar: &quot;thus all unions were united into a single body answerable to the state. The population was no longer there to be mobilised by political parties, rather, the people were the &#x27;floating mass&#x27;, or the &#x27;ignorant mass&#x27;, who needed firm guidance so they would not be lured into politics. In order to &quot;Golkar-ize&quot; the nation, Murtopo sometimes used the military and gangs of young thugs to eliminate political competition.

Golkar was declared on 4 February 1970, to participate in the 1971 legislative elections. Suharto&#x27;s alignment with Golkar paid dividends when Golkar won 62% of the votes and an overwhelming majority in the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR). The members of the DPR also doubled as members of the MPR, and thus, Suharto was easily re-elected to a second term as president in March 1973.

The 1971 legislative election was a success for Golkar and Suharto. Strengthened by his re-election, Suharto quickly began tightening his grip on Golkar. Control was increased in October 1973 with the implementation of a less democratic and more centralized system headed by a chairman. In October 1978, after his re-election to a 3rd term, Suharto further consolidated his control of Golkar by being elected chairman of the executive board (&quot;Ketua Dewan Pembina&quot;), a position whose authority supersedes even the party chairman. From this position, Suharto had the supreme power in Golkar while leaving the day-to-day running of Golkar to the chairman.

Aside from being dominated by Suharto, Golkar was also an organization dominated by the National Armed Forces. Out of the six people that served as Golkar chairmen during the New Order, five had a military background as officers. It was only in the last years of Suharto&#x27;s rule that Harmoko, a civilian, was elected as Golkar chairman.

===Electoral dominance in the New Order===

Golkar continued to dominate Indonesian politics well beyond the 1971 legislative elections. In subsequent New Order legislative elections, Golkar won 62% (1977), 64% (1982), 73% (1987), 68% (1992), and 74% (1997). Golkar&#x27;s dominance was so absolute that for most of the Suharto era, Indonesia was effectively a one-party state. Suharto was able to pass bills without any meaningful opposition, and was able to form a Cabinet which consisted only of Golkar appointees.

After 1973, Suharto banned all political parties except for the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the United Development Party (PPP). These two parties were nominally permitted to contest the reign of Golkar. In practice, however, Golkar permitted only a semblance of competition. Elections were &quot;exercises in controlled aggression&quot;, and were ritualized performances of &quot;choice&quot;, in which local authorities were to obey directives about Golkar&#x27;s electoral results in their area. A system of rewards, punishments, and violence meted out by thugs helped to guarantee cooperation across the archipelago, and the perpetual reelection of Golkar.

After the 1977 and 1997 legislative elections, there were claims of electoral fraud launched by the party, who together with Golkar were the only legal political parties after 1973. There were also claims of Golkar members intimidating the electorate to vote for Golkar.

===After Suharto: &quot;Reformasi&quot; and beyond===

With the Fall of Suharto in May 1998, Golkar quickly sought to adapt and reform itself. In July 1998, a Special National Congress was held to elect the next chairman of Golkar. The congress was dogged by protests by both pro-Suharto and anti-Suharto groups. Suharto himself did not come to the congress. In the contest that followed, Akbar Tandjung emerged as the new chairman of Golkar after beating Army General Edi Sudrajat. It was the first time that a Golkar chairman was elected democratically rather than appointed by the chairman of the executive board. Under Akbar, the executive board was abolished and replaced by an advisory board which had considerably less authority. Edi Sudrajat, feeling that Golkar was insufficiently cooperative with reform movements, left the party and formed the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party. In the same time, elements of the Pancasila Youth that previously supported Golkar formed the Patriot Party led by Yapto Soerjosoemarno.

In 1999, Golkar lost its first democratic legislative election to Megawati Sukarnoputri&#x27;s PDI-P. Golkar won 20% of the votes and was the runner-up in the legislative elections. Despite losing these elections Golkar was still able to secure the Tanjung&#x27;s election as Head of the DPR. October 1999 would see the MPR assemble for its General Session during which a president and a vice president would be elected. It was widely expected that Golkar would support Jusuf Habibie in his bid for a second term as president. Before Habibie could be nominated, however, he was required to deliver an accountability speech: a report delivered by the President to the MPR at the end of his term. The MPR would not ratify the accountability speech and it was revealed that some Golkar members had voted against ratifying the speech.

Although PDI-P had won the legislative elections, Golkar joined forces with the Central Axis, a political coalition put together by MPR Chairman Amien Rais, to nominate and successfully secure the election of Abdurrahman Wahid as president. Golkar, however, was unable to stop the election of Megawati as vice president.

Golkar was rewarded for its support of Wahid by having its members appointed to ministerial positions in Wahid&#x27;s Cabinet. Much like those who had supported Wahid, Golkar would grow disillusioned with Wahid. In April 2000, Jusuf Kalla, a Golkar member who held position as Minister of Industries and Trade was sacked from his position. When Golkar inquired as to why this was done, Wahid alleged it was because of corruption. In July 2001, Golkar, along with its Central Axis allies, held an MPR Special Session to replace President Wahid with Megawati.

On 2002, members who were dissatisfied with Golkar&#x27;s abandonment of former president Suharto including former minister Hartono and Suharto&#x27;s eldest daughter Tutut Soeharto left Golkar and formed the Concern for the Nation Functional Party.

By 2004, the reformist sentiments that had led PDI-P to victory in the 1999 legislative elections had died down. Many Indonesians were disappointed with what Reformasi had achieved thus far and were also disillusioned with Megawati&#x27;s presidency, enabling Golkar to emerge victorious in the 2004 legislative elections with 21% of the votes.

Unlike the other political parties who had one person as their presidential candidate from the start, Golkar had five. In April 2004, Golkar held a national convention to decide who would become Golkar&#x27;s candidate for president. These five were Akbar Tanjung, General Wiranto, Lieutenant-General Prabowo, Aburizal Bakrie, and Surya Paloh. Akbar won the first round of elections but Wiranto emerged as the winner in the second round. Wiranto chose Solahuddin Wahid as his running mate.

The 2004 Presidential Election was held on 5 July. The first round was won by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Jusuf Kalla who faced Megawati and Hasyim Muzadi in the September 2004 run-off. Wiranto/Wahid came second and there were allegations of disunity within the party with Akbar not fully supporting Wiranto after losing the nomination.

In August 2004 Golkar formed, with PDI-P, PPP, Reform Star Party (PBR) and Prosperous Peace Party (PDS), a national coalition to back Megawati. Further infighting would hamper Golkar in its bid to back Megawati. Fahmi Idris led a group of Golkar members in defecting and threw their support behind Yudhoyono and Kalla. At the Presidential Run-Off in September 2004, Yudhoyono emerged victorious over Megawati to become Indonesia&#x27;s 6th president. Yusuf Kalla, who had gone his own way back in April 2004, became vice president.

===2004: Golkar under the Yudhoyono administration===
Although he had overwhelmingly won the presidency, Yudhoyono was still weak in the DPR. His own Democratic Party had only won 7% in the legislative elections and even combined with other parties who had aligned themselves with the new government, they still had to contend with the legislative muscle of Golkar and PDI-P who now intended to play the role of opposition.

With a National Congress to be held in December 2004, Yudhoyono and Kalla had originally backed Head of DPR Agung Laksono to become Golkar chairman. When Agung was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono and Kalla threw their weight behind Surya Paloh. Finally, when Paloh was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono gave the green light for Kalla to run for the Golkar Chairmanship.

This was a widely controversial move. Up to that point, Yudhoyono had not let members of his administration hold a concurrent position in political parties to prevent the possible abuse of power. There were also complaints by Wiranto who claimed that some months earlier, Yudhoyono had promised to support him if he ran for the Golkar chairmanship.

On 19 December 2004, Kalla became the new Golkar chairman with over 50% of the votes. Akbar, who had expected to win a second term as Golkar chairman, was defeated with 30% of the votes. Agung and Surya, who Yudhoyono and Kalla had backed earlier, became the party vice chairman and the chairman of the advisory board, respectively.

Kalla&#x27;s new appointment as chairman of Golkar significantly strengthened Yudhoyono&#x27;s government in Parliament and left the PDI-P as the only major opposition party in the DPR.

After being eliminated in the first round of the 2004 Indonesian presidential election, Wiranto was &quot;traumatized&quot; by his defeat and decided not to run for the presidency without his own political vehicle. He resigned from Golkar Party in 2006 and established Hanura, targeting voters who had supported him in 2004. Meanwhile, Prabowo Subianto who came last in the April 2004 convention also resigned from Golkar on 12 July 2008, forming Gerindra in the process.

At the 2009 Congress, held in Pekanbaru, Aburizal Bakrie was elected chairman, winning 269 out of 583 votes, and beating Surya Paloh into second place. Surya Paloh then went on to establish the National Democratic organization, which in turn established the National Democratic Party.

=== 2014–2024: Leadership dualism and support for the Jokowi administration ===
At the end of 2014, there was dualism in management within Golkar, led by Aburizal Bakrie from the Bali National Conference and Agung Laksono from the Jakarta National Conference. In early March 2015, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia issued a decree legalizing Golkar led by Agung Laksono. In April 2015, the Jakarta State Administrative Court (PTUN) issued an interim decision to postpone the implementation of a decree issued by the Minister of Law and Human Rights Yasonna Laoly which legalized the management of the Golongan Karya Party in the Agung Laksono camp. On 10 July 2015, the four judges who heard the case, namely Arif Nurdu&#x27;a, Didik Andy Prastowo, Nurnaeni Manurung and Diah Yulidar decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the General Chair of the Golongan Karya Party resulting from the Bali National Conference, Aburizal Bakrie, regarding the dualism of party management. The decision was taken at a deliberation meeting of the Jakarta PTTUN panel of judges. With the reading of the PTUN decision, the management of the Golongan Karya Party which was later recognized by the court was the result of the Bali National Conference led by Agung Laksono as general chairman and Zainudin Amali as secretary general.

However, in October 2015, the Supreme Court granted the appeal filed by Golkar as a result of the Bali National Conference led by Aburizal Bakrie. This leadership dualism began to end when an agreement was reached for reconciliation led by the former General Chair of Golkar and Vice President Jusuf Kalla in early 2016. The two camps also agreed to hold an extraordinary national meeting (Munaslub) in mid-2016. This leadership dualism officially ended on 17 May 2016 when Setya Novanto was elected as the new General Chair of the Golongan Karya Party during the Golkar National Conference in Nusa Dua, Bali.

Setya Novanto then announced that Golkar was now supporting the government of Joko Widodo despite backed his rival Prabowo Subianto in the 2014 presidential election. However, due to his corruption cases, Golkar then appointed Airlangga Hartanto as their new chairman, replacing Novanto. Hartanto would later lead Golkar to retain second place during the 2019 election, albeit with seats loss of 6. Golkar also fully backed Jokowi&#x27;s reelection bid with Airlangga assures that the party will not be playing both sides unlike the previous election and prioritize the party to win 18% of the vote and Jokowi&#x27;s victory. Despite securing second place, the election result shows the worst performance for Golkar throughout its electoral participation since 1971, with only 85 seats while finishing third in popular vote with only 12,1%. In the Onward Indonesia Cabinet, Golkar got 3 ministerial post, with Airlangga Hartarto appointed as Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita as Minister of Industry, and Zainudin Amali as Minister of Youth and Sports.

Reflecting the results of the 2019 election, Golkar worked to make changes to rebound from the losses in the upcoming 2024 election. In ensuring this, Golkar began to diversify their voter base by making overtures to the youth vote through the works from Minister of Youth and Sports Dito Ariotedjo to attract young voters. Golkar also attracted politicians such as Ridwan Kamil and Musa Rajekshah, famous politicians in their own home provinces, to boost party standings in the election. Internally, Airlangga also worked to solidify the party base after a period of conflict between Bakrie and Laksono while continuing the consolidation process which were halted when Novanto was indicted for corruption.

==Political identities==
===Ideology===
The 2008 Law on Political Parties states that political parties are allowed to include specific characteristics that reflect their political aspirations, as long as they do not contradict Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. In March 2023, the then chairman Airlangga Hartarto described Golkar as a &quot;centrist&quot; party. Outsider views on the party&#x27;s political orientation vary. Academics and domestic observers classified it as a nationalist party, while their international counterparts described it as a secular-nationalist or conservative party. During the New Order, its political leaning was described as far-right. In the post-Suharto era, Golkar is now considered a centrist, centre-right, or catch-all party.

===Political positions===
The Golkar parliamentary group in the DPR have expressed their opinions on a few issues:
===Party platforms===
Under chairman Aburizal Bakrie, the party has produced a blueprint known as &quot;Vision Indonesia 2045: A Prosperous Nation&quot; with the aim of making Indonesia a developed nation by the centenary of the country&#x27;s independence in 2045. The plan comprises three stages each lasting a decade. The key strategies in the vision comprise developing Indonesia from the villages, strengthening the role of the state, quality economic growth, equalising incomes, ensuring even development in all areas, quality education and healthcare, strengthening communities, sustained economic development, upholding the law and human rights, industrial development based on technology, and revitalization of agriculture and trade.

The first decade would lay the foundations for a developed nation, the second would accelerate development and the final decade would see Indonesia become a developed nation. Each stage would have targets for indicators such as economic growth, GDP, and levels of unemployment and poverty.

===Organisation and factions===
During the New Order Golkar was formally divided into seven (eight since 1971) organizations, called Main Organization Groups (), or KINO. These were:
*the Trikarya, consisting of:
**Central Indonesian Workers&#x27; Organization (, SOKSI/CIWO);
**Mutual Cooperation Multifunction Organizations&#x27; Union (, KOSGORO);
**Mutual Assistance Families Association (, MKGR);
*Indonesian People&#x27;s Working Movement (, GAKARI/IPWM);
*the Defense and Security Mass Organizations (, Ormas Hankam/DSMOs);
*professional organizations ();
*the Development Movement ();
*and, since its establishment by Presidential decree in 1971, the Employees&#x27; Corps of the Republic of Indonesia (, KORPRI).

However, Golkar during this era was also &quot;de facto&quot; divided into three factions:

*The ABRI faction: Consisted of members of the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI) who under Suharto played a dominant role in political affairs. This faction was headed by the ABRI Commander and was commonly known as the A faction. The &quot;Ormas Hankam&quot; was, as a general rule, supportive of the Armed Forces faction. It provided much of the military representation in the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly.
*The Bureaucrats (&quot;Birokrat&quot;) faction: Consisted of KORPRI members—which are &quot;de jure&quot; all civil servants; non-civil servant public officers; employees of state-, provincial- and municipal-owned enterprises; and ABRI members employed by the government. This faction was headed by the Home Affairs Minister and was commonly known as the B faction.
*The Groups (&quot;Utusan Golongan&quot;) faction: Consisted of Golkar members who were neither armed forces service personnel nor the bureaucracy. This faction was headed by the Golkar Chairman and was commonly known as the G faction. Its composition was made up of members of the other organizations that are part of the party.

These three factions worked closely together to gain consensus and in the case of nominating a presidential candidate it was the heads of these three factions who went to inform the candidate (which until 1998 was Suharto) that he had just been nominated as Golkar&#x27;s presidential candidate. The three factions did not always work together however. In 1988, the ABRI faction was unable to nominate Sudharmono as vice president. The factions disappeared along with the fall of the New Order.

<text>The Samajwadi Party ( SP; ) is a socialist political party in India. It was founded on 4 October 1992 by former Janata Dal politician Mulayam Singh Yadav and is headquartered in New Delhi. The Samajwadi Party is currently led by former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav.

While the party is largely based in Uttar Pradesh, it has significant presence in many other Indian states as well. It has been the ruling party in the state of Uttar Pradesh for four terms – three times under Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, the fourth and most recent being Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav&#x27;s full majority government in the 2012–2017 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.

The coalition of the party and its alliance partners: Samajwadi Alliance SP+ is currently the largest bloc in Uttar Pradesh in terms of Lok Sabha MPs. The alliance has one of the largest vote bases in the state of Uttar Pradesh in terms of the collective voting pattern, with more than 37% vote share in the 2022 assembly elections and 44% in the 2024 general elections.

==History==

The Samajwadi Party was one of several parties that emerged when Janata Dal fragmented into several regional parties. The party was founded by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1992. Created just months before the Babri Masjid demolition, the party rose to power by pursuing secular politics. The support of its key voters, Other Backward Classes and Muslims helped the party become a major political force in Uttar Pradesh.

In West Bengal, the West Bengal Socialist Party of Kiranmoy Nanda merged with the SP in 2010. The Samajwadi Party is now led by former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav.

He was chosen as the President for the first time in an Emergency meeting in 2017. He was chosen for second time in 2017 at Agra Convention of Samajwadi Party. He was chosen for the third time at the party&#x27;s national convention held in September 2022 at Lucknow, after he was chosen as the President at the party&#x27;s national convention held on 1 January 2017.

The party have contested Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections around the country, but by far the bulk of its victories have been in Uttar Pradesh. In the 2012 legislative assembly elections of Uttar Pradesh, SP registered a landslide victory with a clear majority in the house, thus enabling it to form a government in the state. This was expected to be the fifth term of Mulayam Singh Yadav as Chief Minister of state, but he selected his son, Akhilesh Yadav instead. This became official on 15 March. It was also the first time that SP was head of the UP government for a full term of five years. However, the party suffered a landslide defeat in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election, slumping to only 47 seats as the Bharatiya Janata Party swept to victory. The major loss of Samajwadi Party was attributed to several factors, most notably being corruption, several political controversies, deteriorating law and order, and insensitive comments on rape as well as anti-women views.

=== National Convention of January 2017 ===
In a National Convention held on 1 January 2017, called by Ram Gopal Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav was appointed as president of the Party for 5 years.

==Position in state and national politics==

=== Alliance ===
====UPA====
The Samajwadi Party provided outside support to the United Progressive Alliance government up to the fourteenth general election. After the fourteenth general election, its support became unnecessary when the UPA became the largest alliance. It contested the 2009 general election in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party of Bihar.

In April 2014, the Save Indian Family Foundation encouraged voters to support the Samajwadi Party or vote None of the above because they had said they opposed the alleged misuse of gender bias laws.
====SP-BSP Alliance====
In 2019 general election, the Samajwadi Party was defeated by the BJP in Uttar Pradesh though allying with Bahujan Samaj Party. It became the thirteenth largest party in parliament. In the general elections of 2019, it won only five seats, while the BSP won 10.

====INDIA====
Recently, Samajwadi Party joined the newly formed Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance(I.N.D.I.A) formed as an umbrella alliance of opposition parties in India.

In the 2024 Indian general election, the Samajwadi Party achieved a historic breakthrough by winning 37 seats, making it the third-largest party in the 18th Lok Sabha. In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party contested the elections in alliance with the Indian National Congress. Together, they secured 43 out of the 80 seats in the state, marking a significant gain for the INDIA Alliance.

=== Presence in state assemblies ===
The SP has two MLAs in Maharashtra and one MLA in the 2022 Gujarat assembly election.

== Samajwadi Prahari and Samajwadi Sanwad ==

He reportedly cited the fight for equal rights for all races and issues related to inequality in youth-related matters as the main issues presented.

<text>The United Development Party (, PPP) is an Islam-based political party in Indonesia.

The PPP was formed in 1973 as a result of the merger between several Islam-based parties, assuming the role of umbrella party for Muslims. 

The party was led by Suryadharma Ali until 2014 when he was prosecuted for corruption. From 2014 to 2016 the party was split in the dispute over its chairmanship. In April 2016, Muhammad Romahurmuziy was declared a new chairman after a reconciliation congress. In the 2024 election, the party won 3.87 of the popular vote, a decrease from 4.52 percent it won in 2019. It was the first time PPP lost all the seats in the DPR.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Ten political parties participated in the 1971 legislative election, a number that President Suharto considered to be too many. Suharto wished that political parties be reduced to just two or three and that the parties should be grouped based on their programs.

The basis for the merger that would result in the birth of the PPP was a coalition of the four Islamic Parties in the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) called the United Development Faction. This faction consisted of Nahdatul Ulama (NU), the Muslim Party of Indonesia (Parmusi), the Islamic Association Party of Indonesia (PSII) and the Islamic Education Movement (Perti).

With encouragement by the Government, officials from all four parties had meetings with each other and after finding some common ground, merged the four Islamic parties in Indonesia into the United Development Party on 5 January 1973. Despite this formal merging of the parties however, internal PPP politics under the Suharto government were dominated by the differing priorities of the original groups that formed the party.

=== Opposition to the New Order ===


In the mid-1970s, popular support for Suharto&#x27;s regime was rapidly waning. When Suharto had seized power with a bloody military coup in 1965 and ousted President Sukarno, the Islamic groups had supported Suharto and aided in persecuting his political opponents. But as the regime had become corrupt and even more authoritarian, this alliance began to crumble. As the 1977 legislative election approached, many began to seek other options to vote for aside from the government-backed Golkar.

Worried that the PPP might win the elections, Suharto played on the fears of the people by having the military arrest a group of people who claimed to be associated with the Jihad Commando (&quot;Komando Jihad&quot;). With this some people became worried that to vote for the PPP and its Islamic leaning would mean expressing support the Jihad Commando and in a government growing increasingly authoritarian, many simply refused to be associated with the wrong side. Golkar would go on to win the legislative elections with 62% with the PPP coming second with 27% of the votes.

The PPP however, would not sit back and accept defeat. At the 1978 MPR General Session, PPP member Chalid Mawardi launched a scathing criticism of Suharto&#x27;s regime. Mawardi accused the Government of being anti-Muslim, complained about the government&#x27;s violent crackdown of dissent, and alleged that the 1977 legislative election was won because of electoral fraud. PPP members also conducted a mass walkout when Suharto referred to religions as &quot;streams of beliefs&quot;.

The PPP seemed to have cemented itself a status as the strongest opposition party. It would not last long however. In 1984, NU, under its Chairman, Abdurrahman Wahid withdrew from the PPP, severely weakening it. The PPP vote share fell from almost 28% in the 1982 legislative election to 16% in the 1987 legislative election, the PPP was also forced by the government to replace its ideology of Islam with the national ideology of Pancasila and to stop using Islamic symbols. As a result, the party replaced its logo showing the Kabah shrine in Mecca with a star. The symbol was identical to the first principle of Pancasila, &quot;Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa&quot; (Belief in the One Supreme God).

=== 1988 MPR general session ===
At the 1988 MPR General Session, Jailani Naro, the PPP Chairman, was nominated as vice president. Suharto, who had been elected to the presidency for a fifth term at the aforementioned General Session, intervened. He cited a decision that the MPR made in 1973 that one of the criteria for a vice president was that he should be able to work with the president. Suharto also conducted discussions with Naro and convinced him to withdraw the nomination.

What Naro did was unprecedented as both Suharto and his vice presidents had always been elected unopposed. The problem this time was Suharto&#x27;s choice for vice president, Sudharmono. Suharto&#x27;s choice had caused a rift between him and his most loyal ally, ABRI. Many within ABRI did not like Sudharmono because he spent more time behind a desk (Sudharmono was a military attorney) than as a field officer. Seeing a gap to exploit, Naro nominated himself, possibly with the private support of ABRI who, in public, had shown support for Sudharmono.

===The PPP in the Reform era ===

The PPP continued as the second biggest party out of the three allowed in the New Order. In May 1998, after Suharto&#x27;s fall, the PPP returned to its Islamic ideology and prepared itself for the 1999 legislative election, where it won 11% of the vote.

In the 1999 MPR General Session, the PPP was part of the Central Axis, a political coalition of Muslim parties which was formed by MPR Chairman, Amien Rais to counter the dominance of Megawati Sukarnoputri&#x27;s Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P). The PDI-P had won the legislative election and Megawati was expected to win the presidency. However, the MPR was still at this stage responsible for electing the president and vice president, and the Muslim parties in the Central Axis did not want a female president. Instead, they nominated and successfully secured the election of Abdurrahman Wahid as president. In the vice-presidential election, PPP Chairman Hamzah Haz ran against Megawati and was defeated.

The PPP was the first of Wahid&#x27;s political allies to become disillusioned with him. The PPP&#x27;s main problem with Wahid was his visit to Israel and the suggestion that he was willing to establish diplomatic relations with that nation. Hamzah who served in Wahid&#x27;s cabinet as Coordinating Minister for People&#x27;s Welfare, immediately resigned from his position just a month after Wahid had appointed him to it. Many other Wahid allies would follow and in July 2001, the PPP would join in removing Wahid from the presidency and naming Megawati as the president. Hamzah was then elected as vice president after defeating Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Akbar Tanjung in the vice-presidential election.

=== 2004 legislative election ===
The PPP won 8.1% of the vote in the 2004 legislative election, a decrease from its 10.7% share of the vote in 1999, but enough to retain its place as the third-best represented party in the legislature, behind the PDI-P and Golkar.

=== 2004 presidential election ===
The PPP originally did not have a presidential candidate in mind for the 2004 presidential election. They had expected that Hamzah would be picked as Megawati&#x27;s running mate and continue the Megawati/Hamzah President/Vice President partnership. Megawati however, chose NU Chairman Hasyim Muzadi as her running mate.

The PPP then continued to wait, still expecting that Hamzah Haz would be picked as a vice-presidential candidate. Finally, a day before the registration of presidential/vice-presidential candidates was closed, Hamzah moved forward and became the PPP&#x27;s presidential candidate. His running mate was Agum Gumelar, who served as Minister of Transportation in Megawati&#x27;s Cabinet. Hamzah&#x27;s presidential run was unsuccessful as he received only 3.1% of the vote and came fifth.

In August 2004, the PPP announced that it was forming a national coalition with the PDI-P, Golkar, the Reform Star Party (PBR) and the Prosperous Peace Party to back Megawati to win the presidential run-off against Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Yudhoyono however would emerge victorious and the PPP would defect from the national coalition to Yudhoyono&#x27;s camp. They were rewarded by being given cabinet places.

=== 2007 party congress ===
The PPP held its 6th National Congress in Jakarta from 30 January to 3 February 2007. On the last day of the Congress, Suryadharma Ali emerged as the new PPP Chairman to replace Hamzah. Suryadharma served as Minister of Cooperatives and State and Medium Enterprises in President Yudhoyono&#x27;s Cabinet. He announced that he would continue as minister while concurrently holding the position of PPP Chairman.

=== 2009 legislative election ===
The party came sixth in the 2009 legislative election with 5.3 percent of the vote, winning 38 seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council. Throughout the election, the party obtained votes from the elderly Muslim men throughout rural and urban area, inside and outside of Java.

===The party in the 2010s===
In the 2014 Indonesian legislative election, the PPP improved on its performance in the previous election winning 6.53% of the vote, and 39 seats in the legislature. Five years later, in the 2019 Indonesian legislative election, the PPP share of the vote fell to 4.52%, and the number of seats it held in the legislature halved to 19.

==Political identities==
===Ideology===
After the fall of Suharto, PPP once again became an Islamist party in the early Post-Suharto era. Today it is considered a centre-right to right-wing nationalist Islamist party which conforms with Pancasila doctrine and no longer upholds sharia as a main goal.

===Party platform===
The party&#x27;s vision is to bring about a nation that is just, prosperous, moral and democratic and that upholds the law, respects human rights and that holds in high esteem the dignity of mankind and social justice based on the values of Islam. The party believes that religion (Islam) has an important role to play as a moral guidance and inspiration in the life of the nation. It is committed to improving the quality of democracy in Indonesia and respects freedom of expression, opinion and organization, the realization of good governance and the endeavor to preserve the unitary Republic of Indonesia based on Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. It supports the concept of a people-based economic system, economic justice, the creation of jobs, the eradication of poverty, state control of sectors of the economy that have a controlling influence on the lives of the majority, a major role for state-owned companies, and economic independence.

<text>Tracer ammunition, or tracers, are bullets or cannon-caliber projectiles that are built with a small pyrotechnic charge in their base. When fired, the pyrotechnic composition is ignited by the burning powder and burns very brightly, making the projectile trajectory visible to the naked eye during daylight, and very bright during nighttime firing. This allows the shooter to visually trace the trajectory of the projectile and thus make necessary ballistic corrections, without having to confirm projectile impacts and without even using the sights of the weapon. Tracer fire can also be used as a marking tool to signal other shooters to concentrate their fire on a particular target during battle.

When used, tracers are usually loaded as every fifth round in machine gun belts, referred to as four-to-one tracer. Platoon and squad leaders will load some tracer rounds in their magazine or even use solely tracers to mark targets for their soldiers to fire on. Tracers are also sometimes placed two or three rounds from the bottom of magazines to alert shooters that their weapons are almost empty. During World War II, aircraft with fixed machine guns or cannons mounted would sometimes have a series of tracer rounds added near the end of the ammunition belts, to alert the pilot that he was almost out of ammunition. However, this practice similarly alerted astute enemies that their foes were nearly out of ammunition. More often, however, the entire magazine was loaded four-to-one, on both fixed offensive and flexible defensive guns, to help mitigate the difficulties of aerial gunnery. Tracers were very common on most WWII aircraft, except for night fighters, which needed to be able to attack and shoot down the enemy before they realized they were under attack, and without betraying their own location to the enemy defensive gunners. The United States relied heavily on tracer ammunition for the defensive Browning M2 .50 caliber machine guns on its heavy bombers such as the B-24 Liberator.

== History ==
There are fireworks manuals from the 14th century specifying a way to make &quot;flaming cannonballs,&quot; with pitch, gunpowder, a cloth/cordage cover, and finally smearing them with lard and tallow. These were however not available for small arms, and before the development of tracers, gunners still relied on seeing their bullets&#x27; impact to adjust their aim. However, these were not always visible, especially as the effective range of ammunition increased dramatically during the later half of the 19th century, meaning the bullets could impact a mile or more away in long-range area fire. In the early 20th century, ammunition designers developed &quot;spotlight&quot; bullets, which would create a flash or smoke puff on impact to increase their visibility. However, these projectiles were deemed in violation of the Hague Conventions″ prohibition of &quot;exploding bullets.&quot; This strategy was also useless when firing at aircraft, as there was nothing for the projectiles to hit if they missed the target. Designers also developed bullets that would trail white smoke. However, these designs required an excessive amount of mass loss to generate a satisfactory trail. The loss of mass en route to the target severely affected the bullet&#x27;s ballistics.

The United Kingdom was the first to develop and introduce a tracer round, a version of the .303 cartridge in 1915. The United States introduced a .30-06 tracer in 1917. Prior to adopting red (among a variety of other colors) bullet tips for tracers, American tracers were identified by blackened cartridge cases.

Tracers proved useful as a countermeasure against Zeppelins used by Germany during World War I. The airships were used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and bombing operations. Normal bullets merely had the effect of causing a slow leak, but tracers could ignite the hydrogen gasbags, and bring down the airship quickly.

In World War II US Naval and marine aircrew were issued tracer rounds with their side arms for emergency signaling use as well as defense.

== Construction ==

A tracer projectile is constructed with a hollow base filled with a pyrotechnic flare material, made of a mixture of a very finely ground metallic fuel, oxidizer, and a small amount of organic fuel. Metallic fuels include magnesium, aluminum, and occasionally zirconium. The oxidizer is a salt molecule that contains oxygen combined with a specific atom responsible for the desired color output. Upon ignition, the heated salt releases its oxygen to sustain the combustion of the fuel in the mixture. The color-emitting atom in the salt is also released and reacts chemically with excess oxygen providing the source of the colored flame. In NATO standard ammunition (including US), the oxidizer salt is usually a mixture of strontium compounds (nitrate, peroxide, etc.) and the metallic fuel is magnesium. Burning strontium yields a bright red light. Russian and Chinese tracer ammunition generates green light using barium salts. An oxidizer and metallic fuel alone, however, do not make a practical pyrotechnic for the purpose of producing colored light. The reaction is too energetic, consuming all materials in one big flash of white lightwhite light being the characteristic output of magnesium-oxide (MgO), for example. Therefore, in the case of using strontium nitrate and magnesium, to produce a red-colored flame that is not over-powered by the white light from the burning fuel, a chlorine donor is provided in the pyrotechnic mixture, so that strontium chloride can also form in the flame, cooling it so that the white light of MgO is greatly reduced. Cooling the flame in this manner also lengthens the reaction rate so that the mixture has an appreciable burn time. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a typical organic fuel in colored light for this purpose. Some modern designs use compositions that produce little to no visible light and radiate mainly in infrared, being visible only on night vision equipment.

== Types ==

There are three types of tracers: bright tracer, subdued tracer, and dim tracer. Bright tracers are the standard type, which starts burning very shortly after exiting the muzzle. A disadvantage of bright tracers is that they give away the shooter&#x27;s location to the enemy; as a military adage puts it, &quot;tracers work both ways&quot;. Bright tracers can also overwhelm night-vision devices, rendering them useless. Subdued tracers burn at full brightness after a hundred or more yards to avoid giving away the gunner&#x27;s position. Dim tracers burn very dimly but are clearly visible through night-vision equipment.

The M196 tracer cartridge (54-grain bullet) 5.56×45mm NATO was developed for the original M16 rifle and is compatible with the M16A1 barrel also using 1:12 rifling twist. It has a red tip and is designed to trace out to 500 yards, and its trajectory matches the M193 (56-grain) ball cartridge, which has no tip color. Trajectory match, or ballistic match, is achieved between two bullets of slightly different weight and aerodynamic characteristics by adjusting the cartridge propellant weight, propellant type, and muzzle velocity, to remain within safe pressure limits, yet provide each bullet with a trajectory to the target that is nearly identical over all atmospheric conditions and target engagement ranges, while using the same gunsight aimpoint. Trajectory match is not intended to be perfect, an engineering impossibility under the closest of similarities between the two bullets, that is further complicated in the case of the tracer losing mass and changing its drag properties as it flies. The intent is that the tracer matches the ball round well enough for the purposes of machinegun fire.

The M856 tracer cartridge (63.7-grain bullet) is used in the M16A2/3/4, M4-series, and M249 weapons (among other 5.56mm NATO weapons). This round is designed to trace out to 875 yards, has an orange tip color, and is trajectory matched to the M855 (62-grain, green tip) ball cartridge. The M856 tracer should not be used in the M16A1 except under emergency conditions and only in relatively warm weather, because the M16A1&#x27;s slower 1:12 rifling twist is not sufficient to properly stabilize this projectile at colder combat service temperatures (freezing down to –40 degrees), when the air density is much greater, disrupting the gyroscopic stability of the bullet. The M16A2 and newer models have a rifling twist of 1 in 7&quot; necessary to stabilize the M856 tracer round under all temperature conditions. (The M196, however, does function safely in all 1:7 twist barrels, as well as those with 1:12 twist.)

The M25 is an orange-tipped 30-06 Springfield tracer cartridge consisting of a 145 gr bullet with 50 grains of IMR 4895 powder. The tracer compound contains composition R 321 which is 16% polyvinyl chloride, 26% magnesium powder, and 52% strontium nitrate.

The M62 is an orange-tipped 7.62×51mm NATO tracer consisting of a 142 gr bullet with 46 grains of WC 846 powder. The tracer compound contains composition R 284 which is 17% polyvinyl chloride, 28% magnesium powder, and 55% strontium nitrate. (This is the same composition used on the M196.)

The M276 is a violet-tipped 7.62×51mm NATO dim tracer that uses composition R 440, which is barium peroxide, strontium peroxide, calcium resinate for example calcium abietate, and magnesium carbonate.

Tracer compositions can also emit primarily in infrared, for use with night-vision devices. An example composition is boron, potassium perchlorate, sodium salicylate, iron carbonate or magnesium carbonate (as combustion retardant), and binder. Many variants exist.

== Other applications ==
Tracers can also serve to direct fire at a given target because they are visible to other combatants. The disadvantage is that they betray the gunner&#x27;s position; the tracer path leads back to its source. To make it more difficult for an enemy to do this, most modern tracers have a delay element, which results in the trace becoming visible some distance from the muzzle.

Depending on the target, tracer bullet lethality may be similar to standard ball ammunition. The forward portion of a tracer bullet contains a substantial slug of lead filler, nearly as much as the non-tracer ball round that it trajectory matches. In the case of the M196/M193 bullet set, the lethality differences are probably negligible for this reason. However, with the M856/M855 bullet set, the M855 ball round contains a steel penetrator tip that is not present in the M856 tracer bullet. As a result, different lethality effects can be expected against various targets. Nevertheless, under some circumstances, a slight degradation in lethality can often be made up for by the psychological and suppressive-fire effects tracer bullets can have on an enemy who is receiving them.

Besides guiding the shooter&#x27;s direction of fire, tracer rounds can also be loaded at the end of a magazine to alert the shooter that the magazine is almost empty. This is particularly useful in weapons that do not lock the bolt back when empty (such as the AK-47). During World War II, the Soviet Air Force also used this practice for aircraft machine guns. One disadvantage in this practice is that the enemy is alerted that the pilot or shooter is low on ammunition and possibly vulnerable. For ground forces, this generally offers no tactical advantage to the enemy, since a soldier with a crew-served weapon such as a machine gun who is out of ammunition is supposed to alert his team that he is &quot;dry&quot; and rely on their cover fire while he reloads the machine gun. Thus, an enemy must risk exposing himself in order to attack the reloading soldier.

Modern jet fighters primarily rely on radar and infrared seeker missiles to track and destroy enemy planes and laser-guided missiles to attack surface targets, rather than the plane&#x27;s cannon, which may be just an ancillary weapon for air-to-air combat; although in the ground attack role, cannon fire may be emphasized. However, modern fighter aircraft use gyroscopes and inertial sensors coupled with radar and optical computing gunsights that make the use of tracers in cannon ammunition unnecessary. As long as the pilot can put the &quot;pipper&quot; (aiming point) in the head-up display (HUD) onto the target, he can be assured that the burst will be on target since the computers automatically compute range, closing rate, deflection, lateral accelerations, and even weather conditions to calculate target lead and aimpoint. Thus one of the primary reasons for using tracers on aircraft in the first place, uncertainty over where the bullets will end up in relation to the target, is removed.

Another use for the tracer is in tank hull machineguns, of mostly outdated tanks, where the machinegun operator cannot sight directly along the barrel, thus he has to rely on tracer bullets to guide his aim. Modern main battle tanks and armored fighting vehicles, however, employ advanced fire control systems that can accurately aim secondary weapons along with the main armament; although the continued use of tracers provides reassurance to gunners on the direction of machinegun fire.

In anti-aircraft autocannon tracer ammunition the tracer material can be part of a shell self-destruct mechanism to prevent missed shots from falling back down on friendly targets. As the tracer material burns to the end it triggers the self-destruct.

== Safety restrictions ==
Tracers are associated with grass fires if used in summer over dry vegetation.

In the UK, the use of tracers is prohibited on National Rifle Association-operated ranges, due to the increased risk of fire. Use of tracers is usually only authorized during military training. During spells of hot weather, the Ministry of Defence will suspend the use of tracers for non-essential training to reduce the risk of wildfires on sites such as Salisbury Plain.

In July 2009, a large fire was started by tracer ammunition near Marseille, France, an area where shrub vegetation is very dry and flammable in the summer, and where normally this kind of ammunition should not be used.

On February 24, 2013, a fire was started at DFW Gun Club in Dallas, Texas, by the use of a tracer round inside the facility.

On July 3, 2018, the Lake Christine Fire near Basalt, Colorado, was started by tracer rounds fired at a gun range. The two individuals who were deemed responsible for the fire were shooting the tracer round ammunition outside of the designated target area at the gun range.

<doc id="408240" wikidata="Q1257317" url="?curid=408240" title="National Awakening Party">
<text>The National Awakening Party (; ), frequently abbreviated to PKB, is an Islam-based political party in Indonesia. It is also the party of the former Vice President of Indonesia, Ma&#x27;ruf Amin, who was elected to its Shura Council.

The party was founded in 1999 by the traditionalist strand of Muslim society in Indonesia, which overlaps with the membership of Nahdlatul Ulama. The party is described as a nationalist Muslim party, which promotes inclusive and nationalist principles and upholds Pancasila doctrine.

In 2014, the party obtained 9.04 percent of the popular vote, which is an increase from 4.95 percent in 2009 but lower than 10.57 percent in 2004. The party is currently led by Muhaimin Iskandar.

==Origins==
The PKB was established on 11 May 1998. Kyai (religious scholars), held a meeting at the Langitan Pesantren (Islamic boarding school) to discuss several problems facing Indonesia they deemed to be critical. They developed an official statement, which Kyai Muchid Muzadi of Jember and Gus Yusuf Muhammad, were sent to deliver to President Suharto. Before they were able to deliver the statement, however, Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998.

On 30 May 1998, the Kyai held a grand meeting, or Istighosah, at the office of the East Java branch of the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) Islamic organization. The meeting resulted in KH Cholil Bisri being urged to form a party based on the NU&#x27;s political aspirations. After initially resisting their request, due to his desire to continue his work with the pesantren, Bisri eventually relented and accepted the leadership role.

A week later, on 6 June, Bisri met the Kyai in order to discuss the formation of the new party. Invitations had been sent via telephone, and more than 200 Kyai attended the meeting, which was held in Bisri&#x27;s home in Leteh, Rembang, Central Java. This meeting resulted in the formation of the &quot;Standing Committee&quot;, consisting of 11 people, with Bisri as chairman and Gus Yus as secretary. In turn, this committee worked in a marathon session, preparing a platform and party components, including the logos which would become the party&#x27;s symbol. The logos were created by KH A. Mustofa Bisri.

The Standing Committee and representatives of the NU held a major conference in Bandung, on 4 July 1998, which was attended by 27 regional representatives. In a discussion regarding the name of the organization, the proposed names were the &quot;National Awakening Party&quot;, the &quot;Nahdlatul Ummah Awakening Party&quot; and the &quot;Ummah Party&quot;. The name chosen was &quot;Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa&quot; (PKB) meaning &quot;National Awakening Party&quot;. The party&#x27;s declaratory was 72 people, representing the age of the NU organization, consisting of the Standing Committee Team (11), the Lajnah Assistance Team (14), Team NU (5), the NU Assistance Team (7), and two Representatives from each of the 27 regions (27 x 2). The 72 founders signed the Party&#x27;s Platform and its components.

Subsequent to this, however, the PBNU decided that only five people could become the party&#x27;s declaratory. Those five were Kyai Munasir Ali, Kyai Ilyas Ruchiyat, Kyai Muchid Muzadi, KH A. Mustofa Bisri and KH Abddurahman Wahid, who was the chairman of the PBNU. The 72 names of the party&#x27;s original declaratory were erased by the PBNU.

The party&#x27;s base of support is strongest in Java Island and draws from the constituency that formerly supported the conservative Muslim organization NU. The PKB differs from Nahdlatul Ulama in that while it supports a role for Islam in government, it does not share the older organization&#x27;s support for an explicitly Islamic republic.

==General elections==
The National Awakening Party stood in the 1999 elections, winning 13 percent of the votes. In the 2004 elections, the party gained 10.57% (11,989,564) of votes and 52 seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council. However, the party won only 4.9 percent of the votes in the 2009 legislative election, and 27 seats in the legislature.

==Policies==
According to the party website, the party&#x27;s policies are to:
* Strengthen democracy to increase the prosperity of people living in villages
* Strengthen the protection of farmers and fishermen
* Accelerate the development of disadvantaged regions
* Make labourers prosperous
* Increase the involvement of women in strategic sectors

For the 2014 elections, the party plans to focus more intensively on its policies related to villages, in particular such as village representation, the allocation of funding for villages and the development of education and health facilities.

== 2024 Planned Takeover by Nahdlatul Ulama ==
Relationship of National Awakening Party and Nahdlatul Ulama became worsened due to differences in political stance during 2024 Indonesian general election. Since Muhaimin Iskandar loss in the election, the party increasingly distanced itself from Nahdlatul Ulama and often taking actions that disadvantaging Nahdlatul Ulama political interests. Due to this, Nahdlatul Ulama Central Committee announced plan for taking over the National Awakening Party leadership on 26 July 2024.

<text>The Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) is an agency of the U.S. state of Georgia operating state prisons. The agency is headquartered in Forsyth, on the former campus of Tift College.

==Headquarters==
The GDC has its offices in Gibson Hall, located in the State Offices South at Tift College in Forsyth, Georgia.

Until 2009, the Georgia Department of Corrections headquarters was in the James H. &quot;Sloppy&quot; Floyd Veterans Memorial Building in Atlanta. In 2006, Governor Sonny Perdue announced that the agency planned to move its headquarters to Tift College by 2009. The state estimated that the relocation would bring around 400 jobs to Forsyth.

A 2007 employee survey indicated that 49% of the headquarters staff who responded to the survey planned to move with the agency and continue employment at the new headquarters. The agency planned to relocate to the former Tift College by 2010. The ordered relocation was to take place in September of that year.

Five GDOC offices in Atlanta are merging into one facility in Tift. After the move was announced in 2006, many employees have moved south of Atlanta, and as of 2010 increasing numbers of employees who live on the south side of Atlanta were hired. Some employees left GDOC for other jobs after the move was announced. Four years of planning and $45 million funded the move. The Georgia Corrections Academy moved to Tift in Fall 2009. In September 2010 the administration began to move into Tift. Employees will reverse commute to Forsyth instead of commuting with traffic into Downtown Atlanta.

The Tift College campus is visible from Interstate 75. Part of the Tift College property will be used as the GDC headquarters, and a part is used as the Georgia Corrections Academy.

The State of Georgia stated that the move will occur because the Atlanta location &quot;does not facilitate effective Command &amp; Control.&quot; There are 92 GDC facilities in the vicinity of Macon/South, while there are 27 GDC facilities in the vicinity of Atlanta/North. There are 35 state prisons in the vicinity of Macon/South and there are five state prisons in the vicinity of Atlanta/North. The agency stated &quot;Elimination of regional offices accentuates need to be in central GA.&quot; In addition, five previous GDC Atlanta offices would be consolidated into one new location; according to GDC this will cause more efficient operations. The moving of the headquarters would cause of space to become available in the Twin Towers complex in Atlanta.

The agency considered placing its headquarters on the property of the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison (GDCP) in unincorporated Butts County, near Jackson. Other potential headquarters sites included another site in Forsyth, Macon, areas around Macon, Centerville, and the area near Warner Robins.

==Facilities==


== Death row==
The state&#x27;s death row for men is in the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison (GDCP) in Butts County, Georgia. The death row for women is located in the Arrendale State Prison. GDCP houses the state&#x27;s execution chamber.

From 1735 until 1924, persons condemned to death were hanged by the sheriff of the county or judicial circuit where the crime occurred. Over 500 of such hangings had occurred. The Georgia General Assembly passed a law on August 16, 1924, that abolished hanging for all capital crimes. Instead the condemned were to be electrocuted at the old Georgia State Prison at Milledgeville. During that year an electric chair was installed in the prison, and the first execution by that method was conducted on September 13, 1924.

On January 1, 1938, the site of the execution chamber relocated to the newly built Georgia State Prison at Reidsville. From 1964 until 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court suspended executions, ruling that states&#x27; laws were insufficient. In 1974 the Supreme Court had outlawed executions and nullified original death penalty laws. The State of Georgia passed a rewritten death penalty law in 1973. In 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Georgia death penalty was constitutional.

In June 1980 the site of execution was moved to GDCP, and a new electric chair was installed in place of the original one. The original chair was put on display at the Georgia State Prison. On December 15, 1983, the first execution at GDCP occurred. In 2000 the Georgia government signed HB 1284 into law, which changed the method of execution to lethal injection, effective May 1, 2000. The first lethal injection execution occurred in October 2001.

The Georgia Department of Corrections stated in its 1999 annual report that &quot;Typically, all Georgia death row inmates are males&quot; and are housed at the GDCP. In November 1998 Kelly Gissendaner, a woman, was given a death sentence and was housed in the Metro State Prison. She was the first woman to reside on death row since 1992, when Janice Buttram&#x27;s sentence was commuted to a life sentence. Buttram had been housed at the Middle Georgia Correctional Institution Women&#x27;s Unit. The death row for women remained at the Metro State Prison, until it was closed in 2011.

== Fallen officers ==

Since the establishment of the Georgia Department of Corrections, 25 officers have died in the line of duty.

==Corrections results==
According to a Pew Center on the States study in 2009, Georgia had one in 13 adults in the justice system. Figures for Georgia juveniles were not tabulated.

==Prison strike==
In 2010, seven Georgia state prisons had inmates that participated in an organized strike. The 2010 Georgia prison strike demanded better healthcare, more sanitary conditions in prison and more educational opportunities.

<doc id="408244" wikidata="Q2279320" url="?curid=408244" title="Telugu Desam Party">
<text>The Telugu Desam Party (TDP; ) is an Indian regional political party primarily active in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It was founded by Telugu matinée idol N. T. Rama Rao (NTR) on 29 March 1982 and has focused on supporting Telugu people. The party has won a five-time majority in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and has emerged as the most successful political outfit in the state&#x27;s history. It is currently the ruling party in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.

From 1 September 1995, the TDP was led by N. T. Rama Rao&#x27;s son-in-law, Nara Chandra Babu Naidu as the national president of the party. The headquarters of the party is called N. T. R. Bhavan, which is located at Mangalagiri, Andhra Pradesh.

==Ideology and symbolism==
The Telugu Desam Party follows a pro-Telugu ideology. It was founded as an alternative to the Congress hegemony, by emphasizing Telugu regional pride and serving as the party for farmers, backward castes and middle-class people. Since the 1990s, it has followed an economically liberal policy that has been seen as pro-business and pro-development.

The TDP uses yellow as the background colour for its flag, with a hut, wheel and plough symbol in the foreground. The party&#x27;s electoral symbol is bicycle.

==Health insurance scheme==
Since 2014, every active member has been eligible for a life insurance policy of ₹2 lakh to be paid to their family in cases of death or permanent total disability, such as the loss of two limbs of eyes, due to accidents, with additional payouts of ₹5,000 per child (up to two) for educational costs. Active members are also reimbursed for up to ₹50,000 to cover hospital treatment from such accidents.

==History==
===N. T. Rama Rao (1983–1995)===

Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR) is a prominent figure in Indian cinema and politics, particularly known for his influence in Telugu-speaking regions. As an actor, he gained widespread recognition not only among Telugu-speaking people but across the country. NTR&#x27;s contributions extend beyond the film industry, as he played a significant role in Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s political landscape.

On 18 November 1977, the Pralaya cyclone struck the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh, particularly affecting Diviseema in Krishna district. The cyclone caused widespread devastation, with turbulent seas resulting in massive flooding. Thousands of people lost their lives, and extensive property damage was reported. Official reports indicated casualties more than 10,000. Around 20,000 acres of crops were destroyed, and the overall damage was estimated to be in crores of rupees. The event left a lasting impact on the people of the region, and the memory of the flooding is still vivid among locals.

Shocked by the devastation, NTR mobilized support from the film industry and the general public to assist the victims of Diviseema. He appealed to people for donations, and the funds raised were used for the rehabilitation of the affected communities.

In response to the challenges faced by the people of Andhra Pradesh, NTR founded the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on 29 March 1982, with the aim of addressing the state&#x27;s political and socio-economic issues. The party&#x27;s formation marked a shift in the political landscape, as it sought to provide an alternative to the long-standing rule of the Indian National Congress, which had been in power for over 26 years. In the 1983 state elections, the TDP secured a landslide victory, and NTR was sworn in as the 10th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh on 9 January 1983.

However, NTR&#x27;s tenure as Chief Minister was interrupted in August 1984 when he went to the United States for medical treatment. During his absence, Nadendla Bhaskara Rao, a TDP MLA, took office as the Chief Minister with the support of the then Governor, Thakur Ram Lal. NTR&#x27;s son-in-law Naidu, played an active role in rallying the support of legislators for NTR. He gathered them at Ramakrishna Cine Studios until NTR&#x27;s return. On 16 September 1984, NTR led a march and protest in Delhi, demonstrating against the central government&#x27;s actions under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Subsequently, NTR regained his position as Chief Minister, restoring his leadership in the state.

In 1985, after successfully regaining his position as Chief Minister following a brief political crisis, NTR called for fresh elections. The elections resulted in a landslide victory for the TDP. Naidu, who was initially involved in party activities by organizing training programs for legislators and computerizing membership records, was subsequently appointed as the party&#x27;s general secretary in 1986.

During his tenure as Chief Minister, NTR implemented significant reforms in Andhra Pradesh, including the divestment of state industries, the introduction of the 1995 MACS Act for co-operatives, and an overhaul of the education system with statewide entrance exams like EAMCET. He also initiated welfare programs such as subsidized rice and housing, along with large-scale irrigation projects like the Telugu Ganga project. NTR’s governance focused on decentralization, women empowerment, and enhancing the state&#x27;s infrastructure, making lasting contributions to its political and economic development.

The party lost power in the 1989 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, and was restricted to the opposition. However, it regained power in the 1994 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election. NTR was sworn in as Chief Minister for the third time. At the national level, the National Front (NF) was established under the leadership of the Janata Dal, which governed India from 1989 to 1990. NTR served as its chairperson.

In 1995, a political crisis in Andhra Pradesh resulted in the removal of NTR as both the Chief Minister and the party president. NTR&#x27;s son-in-law, N. Chandrababu Naidu, along with other family members, including Nandamuri Harikrishna, Nandamuri Balakrishna, and eldest son-in-law Daggubati Venkateswara Rao, ousted NTR from his roles in the party and government. Naidu accused NTR of being influenced by his second wife, Lakshmi Parvathi, whom he had married in 1993 following the death of his first wife, Basava Tarakam, in 1985. With the majority of party legislators supporting him, Naidu went on to become the longest-serving Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the president of TDP since then.

On 18 January 1996, NTR died of a heart attack at his residence in Hyderabad, aged 72. With Naidu already assuming leadership of the TDP, Lakshmi Parvathi founded the NTR Telugu Desam Party (Lakshmi Parvathi). However, it failed to make any impact on the TDP&#x27;s performance or vote share.

===N. Chandrababu Naidu (1995–present)===


=== Telangana (2014–present) ===
After the formation of Telangana, the TDP, in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), contested the 2014 Legislative Assembly election. TDP won 15 seats in the newly formed Telangana Legislative Assembly securing most of its seats in the districts of Ranga Reddy, Hyderabad, Mahabubnagar, Warangal, and Khammam. The party also won a Lok Sabha seat from Malkajgiri in the simultaneously held 2014 Indian general election. However, defections of legislators and other leaders from TDP to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), now known as Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), and the alleged portrayal of TDP as an &quot;Andhra party&quot; by the TRS, led to a decline of the party&#x27;s influence in the state.

In the 2016 Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election, TDP won just one councillor seat out of 150. In the 2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, the party won two seats, both in Khammam district, out of 119 seats. It had contested the 2018 elections as part of the Praja Kutami, which included the Indian National Congress, traditionally a long-time opponent of TDP and other parties.

Following the bifurcation, TDP created separate state units for both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In 2015, L. Ramana, a two time former MLA from Jagtial, was appointed as the first president of the Telangana unit of TDP, serving until 2021. Ramana later quit the party to join the BRS. He was succeeded by Bakkani Narasimhulu, a former MLA from Shadnagar, in July 2021. The party performed poorly in the 2020 Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election, failing to win any seats.

In November 2022, Kasani Gnaneshwar Mudiraj, a former MLC and BC leader, was appointed president of Telangana TDP by N. Chandrababu Naidu. Kasani, who had also served as the national president of the Mudiraj Mahasabha, initiated efforts to revive the party in Telangana after his appointment.

However, on 30 October 2023, Kasani resigned as Telangana TDP president and joined the BRS, following N. Chandrababu Naidu announcement that TDP would not contest the 2023 Telangana Legislative Assembly election. Since then, the party&#x27;s Telangana unit has remained without a leader. The party also announced that it would not contest the 2024 Indian general election in Telangana, but would continue to be part of the NDA.

==== Activities ====
On 21 December 2022, the party organized a large public gathering in Khammam district of Telangana to re-energize the party cadre. It was attended by TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and the T–TDP unit President Kasani. A huge crowd attended the gathering held at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Khammam. While addressing the gathering, Chandrababu Naidu appealed to those who quit the party to join other political parties to return to regain the party&#x27;s past glory. After 2018, it was the first time that TDP organized a show of strength in Telangana.

=== Andaman and Nicobar Islands ===
The TDP also holds influence in the union territory Andaman and Nicobar Islands, contesting the Port Blair Municipal Council elections periodically. With a significant Telugu population in the islands, the party secured and maintained two seats in both the 2015 and 2022 council elections. On 14 March 2023, TDP councillor S. Selvi was elected as the chairperson, as part of the TDP–BJP alliance.

==Electoral performance==
===Lok Sabha electoral performance===
The Telugu Desam Party has had a significant presence in the Lok Sabha elections since its formation in 1982. In its first election in 1984, the party made a debut by winning 30 out of 42 seats in Andhra Pradesh. Over the years, TDP&#x27;s performance in the Lok Sabha elections has fluctuated. In the 1989 elections, the party&#x27;s influence slightly waned but it remained a key player in the state&#x27;s politics.

N. T. Rama Rao served as the chairperson of the National Front, a coalition of non-Congress parties in the late 1980s. The TDP saw a resurgence in the 1996 and 1999 elections, forming alliances with national parties. N. Chandrababu Naidu played a crucial role as the convenor of the United Front, a coalition of non-BJP and non-Congress parties in the mid-1990s.

During the late 1990s, TDP leader G. M. C. Balayogi served as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from 1998 to 2002. The party played a crucial role in supporting the Janata Dal coalition government and was instrumental in the formation of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister. The party&#x27;s alliance with the BJP was pivotal in securing the necessary majority for the NDA.

The TDP&#x27;s fortunes declined in the 2004 and 2009 elections, but it improved it&#x27;s seat count in 2014, winning 16 seats in alliance as part of the NDA. However, in the 2019 elections, TDP faced a major setback, winning only 3 seats amidst strong competition from other parties in the state. After the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the Lok Sabha seats were divided between the newly formed state of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, leaving behind 25 seats in Andhra Pradesh and 17 seats in Telangana. In the recent 2024 election, the party, part of the NDA, managed to win 16 seats, playing a key role in the formation of the Third Modi ministry.

<text>The Liberals of Andorra (, LA) is a conservative-liberal political party in Andorra. It is a member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.

==History==

The party was established as the Liberal Union () in 1992 by Marc Forné Molné. In the 1993 elections it received 22% of the vote and won five seats, making it the second largest party in the General Council. Although the party was in opposition after Òscar Ribas Reig formed a progressive coalition government, Ribas was forced out of office after losing a vote of no confidence and Forné became Prime Minister on 7 December 1994.

After two votes of no confidence, Forné called early elections in 1997. In the run-up to the elections the Union formed alliances with several local parties, including the Liberal Union–Liberal Group of Encamp, the Liberal Opinion Group (GOL), Unity and Renewal (UiR) and the Lauredian Union (UL), with the local parties contesting only at the parish level. The Union won 16 seats of which GOL took four, UL two and the UiR two, with Forné remaining Prime Minister.

Shortly before the 2001 elections the party was renamed the Liberal Party of Andorra () It won 46.1% of the popular vote and 15 seats, with Forné again remaining Prime Minister. In the 2005 elections the party lost another seat, but was still able to form a government, this time led by Albert Pintat. Pintat resigned the leadership, which passed to Joan Gabriel, before the 2009 elections.

In the elections the party was part of the Reformist Coalition alongside the Lauredian Union, Century 21, and two other political parties. The Coalition won 11 seats, whilst the Social Democrats won 14 seats and gained control of the government.

In the run up to the 2011 parliamentary election, the Liberal Party and the other members of the Reformist Coalition gave support to the Democrats for Andorra (DA). The new party chose Antoni Martí as leader and won the election on 3 April 2011 a landslide with 20 of the General Council&#x27;s 28 seats.

Half way through the first term in office of Democrats for Andorra, a group of party activists started to actively work in order to run again separately in the 2015 elections. They presented their new name, Liberals of Andorra, and they announced their intention to stand candidates in the next parliamentary election.

In the 2015 parliamentary election held on 1 March 2015, the Liberal Party received 27.7% of the vote and 8 seats in the General Council.

<text>The Social Democratic Party (, PS) is a social-democratic political party in Andorra.

==History==
The party was established in the run-up to the March 2001 parliamentary elections when the National Democratic Group split in two, with the Democratic Party also being formed. The new party received 28.7% of the vote and won six seats.

In the buildup to the April 2005 parliamentary elections the party formed an alliance named L&#x27;Alternativa with the Parochial Union of Independents Group (GUPI) and Democratic Renewal to contest parish-level seats. The party won six seats at the national level, whilst the alliance won six seats at the parish level. With a total of twelve seats, the party remained in opposition.

The April 2009 parliamentary elections saw the party renew its alliance with GUPI and some independents. The alliance won 14 of the 28 seats and PS leader Jaume Bartumeu became Prime Minister, with the Andorra for Change party supporting the government.

In 2010 the APC withdrew its support for the PS-led government, and in 2011 the General Council rejected the government&#x27;s budget, forcing early elections. The April 2011 parliamentary elections saw the PS receive 34.8% of the vote, reducing its representation to six seats.

In the March 2015 parliamentary elections, the party ran in alliance with the Greens of Andorra, Citizens&#x27; Initiative and independent candidates. The alliance&#x27;s vote share fell to 24%, winning only three seats.

<doc id="408255" wikidata="Q1277738" url="?curid=408255" title="Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party">
<text>The Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP) is a political party in Antigua and Barbuda. The current leader of the party is Gaston Browne, who serves as the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda. The party had previously been led by Lester Bird, who was chairman of the party since 1971, and was Prime Minister and political leader in 1994.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1946, during the first national elections, as the Antigua Labour Party (ALP). Its founders included Vere Bird, father of Lester. The ABLP later came to be seen as a political arm of the Bird family. With the exception of five years in the 1970s, the ABLP ruled Antigua and Barbuda for over four decades leading up to 2004. It was in the opposition from 2004 to 2014, and then returned to power in the 2014 general election.

=== 2004 defeat ===
Two major events precipitated the ABLP&#x27;s first defeat in 28 years in the 2004 elections. First, an Electoral Commission was introduced after the 1999 election. According to international observers, the 1999 election was rife with irregularities. The report from an observer group from across the Commonwealth concluded that &quot;voting rolls appeared to be inflated&quot; and recommended &quot;the establishment of an independent electoral commission to improve the voter registration process.&quot; Second, in 2002 there was a scandal over medical benefits, in which the government failed to contribute EC$120 million to cover recipients&#x27; medical expenses.

The opposition United Progressive Party campaigned on an anti-corruption platform they called &quot;Government in the Sunshine.&quot; The ABLP lost its majority in the general election held on 24 March 2004. It received 41.8% of the popular vote, but won only four out of 17 seats. ABLP Prime Minister and political leader Bird was also defeated in his constituency.

=== Leadership crisis and transition ===
In early 2009, the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party faced an internal leadership crisis. There was speculation that even if the ABLP won the 2009 election, Bird&#x27;s leadership would be challenged. He announced that, if the ABLP failed to win the forthcoming 2009 general election, he would step down. Nevertheless, despite not winning, he remained the ABLP&#x27;s leader until 2012, when he was defeated by Gaston Browne in a leadership challenge.

=== 2014 elections and return to government ===
The Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party won 14 of the 17 seats in the Legislature in the 2014 general elections, forming a majority government with Browne as Prime Minister. They won 15 seats in the 2018 general elections and thereby retained power.

== Ideology ==
Despite having been founded as a partisan expression of the labor movement in Antigua and Barbuda and having labor and social democratic origins, the party is generally considered as an economically liberal and fiscally conservative party, defender of a market-oriented economy and tax reductions, in particular rejecting the imposition of income tax. However, the party&#x27;s policy of maintaining the public sector as the largest employer in Antigua and Barbuda during its successive governments (representing up to 40% of the workforce) has also led to the party being considered a guarantor of a &quot;paternalistic conservatism&quot; or &quot;right-wing socialism.&quot; After the death of Elizabeth II of Antigua and Barbuda, the party went on to officially support the conversion of Antigua and Barbuda into a republic. The party is also against an Antiguan and Barbudan federation.

<text>James Ambrose Johnson Jr. (February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004), better known by his stage name Rick James, was an American singer, songwriter and record producer. Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, James began his musical career in his teenage years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Naval Reserve to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, James moved to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band The Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966. James&#x27;s career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted him of desertion related charges. He served several months in jail. After being released, James moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

After forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown&#x27;s Gordy Records, releasing the album &quot;Come Get It!&quot; in 1978 which produced the hits &quot;You &amp; I&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot;. In 1981, James released his most successful album, &quot;Street Songs&quot;, which included career-defining hits such as &quot;Give It to Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Super Freak&quot;, the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock, and new wave. James was also known for his soulful ballads such as &quot;Fire &amp; Desire&quot; and &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;. He also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including Teena Marie, the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy, and Smokey Robinson.

James&#x27;s mainstream success peaked by the release of his album &quot;Glow&quot; in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, &quot;The A-Team&quot;. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled James&#x27;s &quot;Super Freak&quot; for his 1990 hit, &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; which won Best R&amp;B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. James received his only Grammy for composing the song. By the early 1990s, James&#x27;s career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled in legal issues. In 1993, he was convicted of two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. He was released on parole in 1996. His health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.

In 2004, James&#x27;s career returned to mainstream pop culture after he appeared in an episode of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. The segment involved a Charlie Murphy &quot;True Hollywood Stories&quot;-style sketch that satirized James&#x27;s wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. He died later that year from heart failure at age 56.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
James Ambrose Johnson Jr. was born on February 1, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, to Mabel (née Sims) and James Ambrose Johnson Sr. He was one of eight children. He was an altar boy and choir member at St. Bridget&#x27;s Catholic Church. James&#x27;s father, an autoworker, left the family when James was 10. His mother was a dancer for Katherine Dunham, and later worked as a cleaner in the day, and as a numbers-runner for the Buffalo crime family at night to earn a living.

=== Early career ===
In 1964, James fled to Toronto. Soon after his arrival three drunk men tried to attack him outside a club; a trio of other men came to his aid. One of them, Levon Helm, was at the time a member of Ronnie Hawkins&#x27; backing band. Helm invited James to their show later that night and he ended up performing onstage with the band. To evade US military authorities, James went under the assumed name &quot;Ricky James Matthews&quot;. That same year, James formed The Mynah Birds, a band that produced a fusion of soul, folk and rock music. In 1965, the band briefly recorded for the Canadian division of Columbia Records, releasing a single, &quot;Mynah Bird Hop&quot;/&quot;Mynah Bird Song&quot;. At one point, Nick St. Nicholas, later of Steppenwolf fame, was a member; by the time &quot;Mynah Bird Hop&quot; was recorded bassist Bruce Palmer had replaced him. James and Palmer recruited guitarists Tom Morgan and Xavier Taylor and drummer Rick Mason to form a new Mynah Birds lineup, and soon traveled to Detroit to record with Motown. Before the group began recording their first songs for the label, Morgan left, unhappy about the label&#x27;s attitude toward the musicians. Neil Young eventually took his place. It was while in Detroit that James met his musical heroes, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. After meeting Wonder and telling him his name, Wonder felt the name &quot;Ricky James Matthews&quot; was &quot;too long&quot; and told James to shorten it to &quot;Ricky James&quot;.

In 1966, a financial dispute in Toronto between James and the Mynah Birds&#x27; handler, Morley Shelman led to Motown&#x27;s learning of James&#x27;s fugitive status with the Navy. Hoping to prevent any scrutiny, Motown execs told Rick they would not be releasing any more of his material and convinced him to come back and work with them after straightening out his legal issues. James surrendered himself to the FBI, and, in May 1966, was sentenced by the Navy to five months&#x27; hard labor for unauthorized absence. He was not yet 19 years old. James escaped from the Brooklyn Naval Brig after only six weeks&#x27; confinement, but following another six months as a fugitive, surrendered himself a second time. With help from his mother, James found legal assistance from his cousin, future Congressman Louis Stokes, and another attorney, former Marine Captain John Bracken, who pled James&#x27;s second court-martial down from a potential five years&#x27; hard labor to five months. After his release from Portsmouth Naval Prison in August 1967, James returned to Toronto and endured another detention, initially derailing resumption of his career with Mynah Bird bandmate Neil Merryweather, with whom he would later collaborate, first at Motown and then in Los Angeles.

In 1968, again working under the pseudonym Ricky Matthews, James produced and wrote songs at Motown for acts such as The Miracles, Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers, and The Spinners. It was during this third stint at Motown that James met musician Greg Reeves. Reeves, hoping to find a better situation than the US$38 a week (US$ in dollars) he was earning as a session bassist for Berry Gordy, joined James, looking to &quot;hitch a lift from Neil Young&#x27;s rising star,&quot; and relocated to Los Angeles.

On one of his first nights in Los Angeles, James was crashing on musician Stephen Stills&#x27; couch. When he awoke, he saw a stoned young man sitting on the floor in the lotus position. The man&#x27;s wrists were bleeding so a scared James sought help. James was later formally introduced to the man who was Jim Morrison, lead singer of the Doors. After the Doors opened for Buffalo Springfield at the Whisky a Go Go, Morrison tricked James into taking acid.

In California, James initially worked as a duo with Greg Reeves, but soon after James introduced Reeves to Neil Young, it was Reeves, not James, who was hired as bassist for the newly formed rock supergroup, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Around this time James formed several versions of the rock band Salt&#x27;N&#x27;Pepper. James claimed that in 1969 friend and hairstylist Jay Sebring invited him to attend a party at actress Sharon Tate’s house, but he was too hungover to get out of bed. The next morning, he discovered that Sebring had been murdered when he saw the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; headline &quot;Sharon Tate, Four Others Murdered.&quot;

In 1970, James and Salt&#x27;N&#x27;Pepper member Ed Roth participated in the recording of Bruce Palmer&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Cycle Is Complete&quot;. The duo also recorded as part of the group Heaven and Earth in Toronto. Heaven and Earth eventually changed their name to Great White Cane and recorded a self-titled album for the Los Angeles label Lion Records, released in 1972. James formed another band, Hot Lips, afterwards. He also briefly replaced Mendelson Joe in the Toronto blues band McKenna Mendelson Mainline. During this period, James and Mainline guitarist Mike McKenna co-wrote the song &quot;You Make the Magic&quot;, which would later be released by The Chambers Brothers as a B-side to their single &quot;Boogie Children.&quot;

=== Solo career ===

In 1973, James signed with A&amp;M Records, under the name Rick James. The first single, &quot;My Mama&quot;, was released in 1974, becoming a club hit in Europe.

In 1976, James returned to Buffalo and formed the Stone City Band. Shortly thereafter, he recorded &quot;Get Up and Dance!&quot;, his second single to be released. In 1977, James and the Stone City Band signed a contract with Motown&#x27;s Gordy Records imprint and began recording their first album in both New York City and Los Angeles.

In April 1978, James released his debut solo album, &quot;Come Get It!&quot;, which included the Stone City Band. The album launched the top 20 hit, &quot;You and I&quot;, which became his first number-one R&amp;B hit. The album also included the hit single, &quot;Mary Jane&quot;. It eventually sold a million copies, launching James&#x27;s musical career to stardom, and helping out Motown Records at a time when label fortunes had dwindled. In early 1979, James&#x27;s second album, &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out of L Seven&quot;, followed the previous album&#x27;s success, reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the R&amp;B album charts. A third album, &quot;Fire It Up&quot;, was released in late 1979. Around that same period, James launched his first headlining tour, the Fire It Up Tour, and agreed to invite the then-upcoming artist, Prince, as well as singer Teena Marie, as his opening act.

Following the end of the tour in 1980, James released the ballads-heavy &quot;Garden of Love&quot;, which was a relative flop only reaching number 83 on the Billboard 200. In 1981, James recorded his best-selling album to date, &quot;Street Songs&quot;, which like his previous four albums, was a concept album. &quot;Street Songs&quot; featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and new wave, as well as James&#x27;s brand of crossover funk, enabling James&#x27;s own style of &quot;punk funk&quot;. The album featured hit singles such as &quot;Ghetto Life&quot;, the Teena Marie duet &quot;Fire and Desire&quot;, &quot;Give It to Me Baby&quot;, and his biggest crossover hit to date, &quot;Super Freak&quot;, which peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and sold over a million copies in the United States. &quot;Street Songs&quot; peaked at number one R&amp;B and number three pop and sold over 4 million copies worldwide. Following up that success, James released two successive gold-certified albums, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Throwin&#x27; Down&quot; and 1983&#x27;s &quot;Cold Blooded&quot;.

During this period, when Prince also became a success as a producer of other acts including The Time and Vanity 6, James launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the Mary Jane Girls, featuring his former background singer Joanne &quot;JoJo&quot; McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, &quot;All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Candy Man&quot;, and &quot;In My House&quot;. In 1982, James produced the Temptations&#x27; Top 10 R&amp;B hit, &quot;Standing on the Top&quot;. In 1983, James recorded the hit duet, &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;, with singer Smokey Robinson, as well as a ballad &quot;Tell Me What You Want&quot; with an introduction by Billy Dee Williams. In 1985, James produced another hit for entertainer Eddie Murphy with the song &quot;Party All the Time&quot;. That same year he appeared on an episode of &quot;The A-Team&quot; with Isaac Hayes. After the release of his ninth solo album, &quot;The Flag&quot;, in 1986, James signed with Warner Bros. Records, which released the album &quot;Wonderful&quot; in 1988, featuring the hit, &quot;Loosey&#x27;s Rap&quot;.

James&#x27;s controversial and provocative image became troublesome sometimes. Famous for promoting the use of marijuana live in concerts during a time that simple possession could lead to a long-term prison sentence, James was often threatened by cops in various cities that he would be arrested if he smoked marijuana on stage during performances of songs such as &quot;Fire It Up&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot;. According to Kerry Gordy, most Motown executives erroneously thought the latter song was a &quot;simple cute love song to a girl&quot; not knowing the song was about marijuana.

James&#x27;s overtly sexual bravado made it tough for him to be a bigger mainstream act. After the debut of the fledgling music video network MTV in August 1981, James tried to present the music video to &quot;Super Freak&quot; to the label, only for the channel to turn the video down. James accused the network of racism. MTV denied this, stating the real reason &quot;Super Freak&quot; was turned down by MTV was because they felt James&#x27;s video was too vulgar for the channel. When younger artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince found fame on the channel, James accused the two singers of being &quot;tokens&quot; in a 1983 interview, demanding that any black artist that had a video aired on MTV to take their video off the channel in protest. James&#x27;s rant was cosigned by David Bowie, who argued with MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the lack of black artists being featured on the channel despite the successes of Jackson and Prince.

When MTV and BET both avoided playing the video for &quot;Loosey&#x27;s Rap&quot; because of its graphic sexual content, James considered the networks hypocritical in light of them still playing provocative videos by artists such as Madonna.

=== Decline ===
In 1989, James&#x27;s 11th album, &quot;Kickin&#x27;&quot;, was released only in the UK. By 1990, he had lost his deal with Reprise/Warner Bros., and James began struggling with personal and legal troubles. That year MC Hammer released his hit signature song, &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;, which sampled the prominent opening riff from &quot;Super Freak&quot;. James and his co-writer on &quot;Super Freak&quot;, Alonzo Miller, sued Hammer for shared songwriting credit and all three received a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song in 1991.

In 1997, James released &quot;Urban Rapsody&quot;, his first album since his release from prison on assault charges and he toured to promote the album. That year, he discussed his life and career in interviews for the VH1 musical documentary series, &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, which aired in early 1998. James&#x27;s musical career slowed again after he suffered a minor stroke during a concert in 1998. He was featured on the song &quot;Love Gravy&quot; with Ike Turner for the 1998 soundtrack album &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot;. James accepted an offer by Eddie Murphy to appear in the comedy-drama &quot;Life&quot; (1999).

===Resurgence===

====&quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;====
In early 2004, after years out of the spotlight, James participated in a comedy sketch on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, in a segment called &quot;Charlie Murphy&#x27;s True Hollywood Stories.&quot; James and Murphy recounted humorous stories of their experiences together during the early 1980s. During the sketch, James&#x27;s character, played by Dave Chappelle, utters the now famous catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;m Rick James, bitch!&quot; The sketches were punctuated by James, explaining his past behavior with the phrase, &quot;Cocaine is a hell of a drug!&quot;

James enjoyed a career revival after his appearance on the show. He supported Teena Marie&#x27;s tour of her album &quot;La Doña&quot; and toured with her in May 2004, playing with her at the KBLX Stone Soul Picnic, Pioneer Amphitheatre, Hayward, California. James gave his last public appearance and performance at the fourth annual BET Awards on June 29, 2004. He performed a live rendition of &quot;Fire &amp; Desire&quot; with Teena Marie. James called out a girl backstage who didn&#x27;t recognize him by saying, &quot;Never mind who you thought I was, I&#x27;m Rick James, bitch!&quot; The audience erupted and gave James a standing ovation as he walked off the stage.

=== Autobiography ===
At the time of his death, James was working on an autobiography, &quot;The Confessions of Rick James: Memoirs of a Super Freak&quot;, as well as a new album. The book was finally published in 2007 by Colossus Books and features a picture of his tombstone. Noted music journalist/biographer David Ritz, who had been employed by James to work on the book with him, later said that this version did not truly reflect how the musician wanted himself portrayed. In 2014, Ritz published his own, re-edited version, &quot;Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James&quot;.

===Music publishing sale===

In November 2020, James&#x27;s estate confirmed the sale of a 50% stake in his publishing and masters catalog to the Hipgnosis Songs Fund, founded by Canadian music industry executive and entrepreneur Merck Mercuriadis.

=== Documentary ===
In 2021, James was the subject of a documentary film, &quot;Bitchin&#x27;: The Sound and Fury of Rick James&quot;, directed by Sacha Jenkins, that was produced and broadcast by Showtime. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary has 100% positive reviews from 13 professional reviewers.

=== Stage musical ===
Rick James life will be depicted in a 2024 touring stage production musical titled &quot;Super Freak: A Rick James Story&quot; produced by Ja&#x27;Caryous Johnson and James&#x27; daughter Ty James. Stokley Williams of the notable R&amp;B band Mint Condition is set to star in the titular role. 

==Personal life==

===Relationships and children===
James had two children with Syville Morgan, a former singer and songwriter. They had a daughter, Tyenza, and a son, Rick Jr.

James dated actress Linda Blair from 1982 to 1984. They met after James read an interview where Blair called him sexy. He contacted her and spent time getting to know the actress during a short stint living at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. Early in their relationship, Blair became pregnant and had an abortion. James wrote in his memoir, &quot;I loved Linda and it hurt me that she would choose to abort our child without even wanting to talk to me about it first. I still look back on her choice with sadness and wonder about our baby, and how having that child might have changed my life.&quot; His hit song &quot;Cold Blooded&quot; was about his relationship with Blair. &quot;It was about how Linda could freeze my blood,&quot; he wrote in his memoir.

In 1989, James met 17-year-old party-goer Tanya Hijazi. The two began a romance shortly after. In 1993, the couple had their only child and James&#x27;s youngest, Tazman. Following their respective releases from prison for assaulting Mary Sauger and Frances Alley, they married in 1996 and divorced in 2002.

James was very close with Teena Marie, whom he met and began collaborating with in 1979. Teena Marie stated they were engaged &quot;for two weeks.&quot; Their professional partnership lasted into 2004, when Marie released her comeback album, &quot;La Doña&quot;, which included her and James&#x27;s duet &quot;I Got You&quot;. When James died, Teena Marie said she was &quot;devastated by his death&quot; and struggled with a painkiller addiction following his passing.

===Friendships===
James had a close friendship with Eddie Murphy, whom he met in 1981. He was also close to Murphy&#x27;s older brother Charlie Murphy, who worked as a security guard for his brother. On the Chappelle show skits, Charlie Murphy recalled occasions of mistreatment by James.

James was good friends with actress Debbie Allen. Allen once invited James to a Broadway show and sent a car to pick him up; during the show, James fell asleep due to exhaustion from prior sexual activities. Afterwards, Allen confronted him in the dressing room. She pinned him down and pleaded that he was throwing his life away. &quot;All you do is get high and have sex,&quot; she said. He promised to change his ways, but he broke his promise that same night.

James was also a friend of fellow Motown act performers Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye, singers James idolized as a teenager. Additionally, he befriended Gaye&#x27;s second wife, Janis, and he was godfather of Gaye&#x27;s daughter Nona. James&#x27;s relationship with Robinson began shortly after James signed with Motown and, in 1983, the duo recorded the hit &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;.

James also idolized former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin and Ruffin&#x27;s self-proclaimed cousin, bass vocalist Melvin Franklin, and grabbed at the chance to produce the hit &quot;Standing on the Top&quot; for them in 1982. Before that, the then-current lineup of the group recorded background vocals on two James-associated projects—James&#x27;s &quot;Street Songs&quot; (singing &quot;Ghetto Life&quot; and &quot;Super Freak&quot;) and Teena Marie&#x27;s &quot;It Must Be Magic&quot; (singing on the title track). In &quot;Super Freak&quot;, &quot;It Must Be Magic&quot;, and &quot;Standing on the Top&quot;, James famously shouted out, &quot;Temptations, SING!&quot;

===Drug abuse and health problems===
James&#x27;s drug abuse began in his teens, first with marijuana and heroin. He began using cocaine in the late 1960s. Although James claimed that he quit cocaine when he entered prison, his autopsy showed there was a small amount of the drug in his bloodstream at the time of his death.

His drug use led to major health problems. In April 1984, he was hospitalized after being found unconscious at his house by a friend. In 1998, James suffered a stroke after a blood vessel ruptured in his neck during a concert at Mile High Stadium in Denver. Earlier that year he had hip replacement surgery to repair bone damage &quot;from jumping around on stage and substance abuse.&quot;

===Kidnapping, rape, and assault convictions===
By the 1990s, James&#x27;s drug abuse was public knowledge. He was heavily addicted to cocaine and later admitted to spending about $7,000 per week on drugs for five years straight. On August 2, 1991, James and his girlfriend Tanya Hijazi were arrested on charges of holding 24-year-old Frances Alley hostage for up to six days, tying her up, forcing her to perform sexual acts, and burning her legs and abdomen with the hot end of a crack cocaine pipe during a week-long cocaine binge. James faced a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on all charges, which included assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated mayhem, torture, forcible oral copulation, false imprisonment and kidnapping.

On November 3, 1992, while out on bail for that incident, James, under the influence of cocaine, assaulted music executive Mary Sauger at the St. James Club and Hotel in West Hollywood. Sauger said she met James and Hijazi for a business meeting, but that the two then kidnapped and beat her over a 20-hour period.

James was found guilty of both offenses but was cleared of a torture charge that could have put him in prison for the rest of his life. While serving his five-year sentence at Folsom Prison, James lost a civil suit to Sauger, who was awarded nearly $2 million in damages in 1994. James was ordered to pay her about $1 million; the hotel and a private security firm were found liable for nearly $750,000 in damages due to negligence. James was released from prison on August 21, 1996, after serving more than two years.

In 1998, James was accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old woman, but the charges were later dropped. In 2020, his estate was sued for $50 million by a woman who accused him of raping her when she was 15 years old at a group home for troubled youths in Buffalo, New York, in 1979. The suit was later dismissed.

==Health problems and death==

On the morning of August 6, 2004, James&#x27;s caretaker found him dead in his Los Angeles home at the Oakwood Toluca Hills apartment complex, just outside Burbank. He was 56 years old. His longtime publicist, Sujata Murthy, released a statement to the media stating he died of natural causes. James died from pulmonary failure and cardiac failure, associated with his various health conditions of diabetes, a stroke, pacemaker, and heart attack. His autopsy found alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam, bupropion (Wellbutrin), citalopram (Celexa), hydrocodone, digoxin (Digitalis), chlorpheniramine, methamphetamine, and cocaine in his blood. However, the coroner stated that &quot;none of the drugs or drug combinations were found to be at levels that were life-threatening in and of themselves&quot;. 

Following a public viewing for fans, a private memorial was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park – Hollywood Hills.

<doc id="408260" wikidata="Q1452315" url="?curid=408260" title="All India Forward Bloc">
<text>The All India Forward Bloc ( AIFB) is a left-wing nationalist political party in India. It emerged as a faction within the Indian National Congress in 1939, led by Subhas Chandra Bose. The party re-established as an independent political party after the independence of India. During the 1951–1952 and 1957 Indian general election, the party was known as Forward Bloc (Marxist). It has its main stronghold in West Bengal. The party&#x27;s current Secretary-General is G. Devarajan. Veteran Indian politicians Sarat Chandra Bose (brother of Subhas Chandra Bose) and Chitta Basu had been the stalwarts of the party in independent India.

Leveraging Netaji&#x27;s sway over the populace, the organization had established its electoral footprint after Independence in states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Assam, with West Bengal as its primary bastion. However, after eight decades, the party, now confined to select regions, lacks any Members of Parliament or Legislative Assembly representatives.

==History==

===Formation of the Forward Bloc===
The Forward Bloc of the Indian National Congress is a Political Party that was formed on May 3, 1939, by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in Makur Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, who had resigned from the presidency of the Indian National Congress on 29 April after being outmaneuvered by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The formation of the Forward Bloc was announced to the public at a rally in Calcutta. Bose said that all who were joining, must never turn their back to the British and must fill the pledge form by cutting their finger and signing it with their blood. First of all, seventeen young girls came up and signed the pledge form. Initially the aim of the Forward Bloc was to rally all the leftwing sections within the Congress and develop an alternative leadership inside the Congress. Bose became the president of the Forward Bloc and S.S. Kavishar its vice-president. A Forward Bloc Conference was held in Bombay in the end of June. At that conference the constitution and programme of the Forward Bloc were approved. In July 1939 Subhas Chandra Bose announced the Committee of the Forward Bloc. It had Subhas Chandra Bose as president, S.S. Kavishar from Punjab as its vice-president, Lal Shankarlal from Delhi, as its general secretary and Vishwambhar Dayalu Tripathi and Khurshed Nariman from Bombay as secretaries. Other prominent members were Annapurniah from Andhra Pradesh, Senapati Bapat, Hari Vishnu Kamath from Bombay, Pasumpon U. Muthuramalingam Thevar from Tamil Nadu and Sheel Bhadra Yagee from Bihar. Satya Ranjan Bakshi, was appointed as the secretary of the Bengal Provincial Forward Bloc.

In August, the same year Bose began publishing a newspaper titled &quot;Forward Bloc&quot;. He travelled around the country, rallying support for his new political project.

===The first conference===
The next year, on 20–22 June 1940, the Forward Bloc held its first All India Conference in Nagpur. The conference declared the Forward Bloc to be a socialist political party, and the date of 22 June is considered as the founding date of the party by the Forward Bloc itself. The conference passed a resolution titled &#x27;All Power to the Indian People&#x27;, urging militant action for struggle against British colonial rule. Subhash Chandra Bose was elected as the president of the party and H.V. Kamath as the general secretary.

===Arrest and exile of Bose===
Soon thereafter, on 2 July 1940 Bose was arrested and detained in Presidency Jail, Calcutta. In January 1941 he escaped from house arrest, and clandestinely went into exile. He travelled to the Soviet Union via Afghanistan, seeking Soviet support for the Indian independence struggle. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin declined Bose&#x27;s request, and he then travelled to Germany. In Berlin he set up the Free India Centre, and rallied the Indian Legion.

Inside India, local activists of the Forward Bloc continued the anti-British activities without central co-ordination. For example, in Bihar members were involved in the Azad Dasta resistance groups, and distributed propaganda in support of Bose and Indian National Army. They did not have, however, any organic link either with Bose nor the INA.

===Post-war reorganisation===
At the end of the war, the Forward Bloc was reorganised. In February 1946 R.S. Ruiker organised an All India Active Workers Conference at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. The conference declared the formation of the &#x27;FB Workers Assembly&#x27;, in practice the legal cover of the still illegal Forward Bloc. Notably some leading communists from Bombay, like K.N. Joglekar and Soli Batliwalli, joined the &#x27;FB Workers Assembly&#x27;. The Workers Assembly conference declared that the &quot;Forward Bloc is a Socialist Party, accepting the theory of class struggle in its fullest implications and a programme of revolutionary mass action for the attainment of Socialism leading to a Classless Society.&quot;

Ahead of the 1946 assembly elections the ban on the Bloc was lifted in June that year. The Working Committee of the Forward Bloc met on 10 June.

Elections to the Constituent Assembly and to provincial legislatures were held in December 1946. The Forward Bloc contested the elections. H.V. Kamath won a seat in the Constituent Assembly and Jyotish Chandra Ghosh, Hemantha Kumar Basu and Lila Roy were elected to the Bengal Legislative Assembly.

===Arrah conference===
The Bloc held its 2nd All India Conference in Arrah, Bihar on 12–14 January 1947. S.S. Kavishar (a leading member of the Subhasist sector) was elected president and Sheel Bhadra Yagee (a leading member of the Marxist sector) was elected general secretary.

===Split between Yagee and Ruikar===
Following Independence and Partition, the party national council met in Varanasi February 1948. The national council meeting was also preceded by a decision of the Indian National Congress in the beginning of the year to expel all dissenting tendencies within the Congress, including the Forward Bloc. Thus the party decided to renounce any links with the Congress once and for all, and reconstruct itself as an independent opposition party. Moreover, it passed a resolution that the party be divided into a Forward Bloc for India and a Forward Bloc for the new nation of Pakistan. This would soon prove to be very controversial. The general secretary Yagee did, in line with the Varanasi resolution, dissolve the Bengal committee of the Forward Bloc and set-up &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees for West Bengal and East Bengal. Now the division between &#x27;Marxists&#x27; and &#x27;Subhasists&#x27; resurfaced. The &#x27;Subhasists&#x27;, and S. S. Kavishar in particular, criticised Yagee&#x27;s actions.

The split was now a fact. The &#x27;Subhasist&#x27; group, led by Ruiker and Cavesheer, called for a conference in Chandannagar, West Bengal. Their conference was held on 29–31 December. On the same dates Yagee organised a conference in Calcutta. Effectively there was now two Forward Blocs, the Forward Bloc led by Ruiker and the Forward Bloc led by Yagee. Yagee was elected general secretary and K.N. Joglekar, chairman of the Yagee-led group.

Roughly speaking the Yagee&#x27;s party had its main base in Bihar, Punjab and West Bengal, whereas the Ruiker-led group had its strongholds in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.

In Tripura, a united front was formed by the Communist Party of India, Tripura Ganatantrik Sangha, Ganamukti Parishad, Ganatantrik Nari Samiti and independents to contest the election to the Tripura electoral college (whose function was to appoint a Rajya Sabha delegate from Tripura) jointly. The Forward Bloc participated in mass rallies on 2 October and 2 December 1951. However, just before the election the Forward Bloc withdrew from the front and decided to contest three of the 30 seats on their own. None of the Forward Bloc candidates were elected.

The 5th party conference (a 4th party plenum had been held in Ingota, U.P. in 1949) was held in Puri, Odisha on 28–31 December 1952. Mohan Singh was elected chairman and Dhillon as general secretary.

===Expulsion of Yagee and Singh===
In 1955, the Indian National Congress adopted socialism as its policy. Thus, leaders like Yagee and Singh then proposed that, as the Congress had become a socialist party, the Forward Bloc ought to merge with it. Singh and Yagee, without consulting the Central Committee nor the party membership, declared the unification of the Forward Bloc into the Congress. Many sections of the party disagreed with this move, and a Central Committee meeting was held in Nagpur 11–15 May. The Central Committee decided to expel Singh and Yagee. Hemanta Kumar Bose was elected as the new chairman and R.K. Haldulkar as general secretary.

===Socialist unity===
In 1964, a unity process was initiated by the Praja Socialist Party, which eventually resulted in the formation of the Samyukta Socialist Party. The Forward Bloc was invited to join the new party, and the Delhi unit of the party did take part in a joint socialist anti-Nehru campaign conference in April 1964.

===Death of U.M. Thevar===
The party stalwart in Tamil Nadu, U. Muthuramalingam Thevar, died on 30 October 1963. Following his death a power-struggle began between two of his disciples, Sasivarna Thevar and P.K. Mookiah Thevar. Mookiah Thevar emerged victorious and Sasivarna Thevar left to form his own party, the Subhasist Forward Bloc.

A by-election for the Aruppukottai Lok Sabha constituency seat vacated by U. Muthuramalingam Thevar&#x27;s death was held in 1964, in which the Forward Bloc was defeated for the first time.

===Progressive Front in Tripura===
In 1965, the party joined a &#x27;Progressive Front&#x27; in Tripura. The front consisted of the Communist Party of India, the Forward Bloc and a break-away faction of the Socialist Party. The front demanded nationwide land reforms, strengthening of the national defence, withdrawal from the Commonwealth, nationalisation of foreign capital, a rational food policy, release of all political prisoners and scrapping of the Indo-American agreement of food supply. Existence of the new front was declared at a meeting in Agartala on 17 November. Mass rallies of the front were held in Belonia on 28 November and then in Birchandra Bazar (near Belonia) on 1 December. The front did not last, though, as in the 1967 election the communist parties aligned with a splinter group of the Congress Party. The Forward Bloc did not present any candidates in that election.

===1968 split in Tamil Nadu===
In 1968, two influential party leaders in Tamil Nadu Velayudham Nayar (then a central committee member of the party) and S. Andi Thevar broke away from AIFB and founded the Revolutionary Forward Bloc. Nayar and Thevar accused the Forward Bloc of having deviated from its socialist principles through its co-operation with the rightwing Swatantra Party.

===West Dinajpur clashes===
In July 1969, violent clashes erupted in West Dinajpur district, West Bengal, between peasants aligned with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and East Pakistani refugee cultivators, who supported the Forward Bloc. CPI(M) leader Hare Krishna Konar characterised the events as a degeneration of the agrarian struggles in rural West Bengal.

===Split in the Indian National Congress===
In 1969, a major split occurred in the Indian National Congress. Indira Gandhi had entered into open conflict with the traditional Congress leadership. Effectively two separate Congress parties appeared, the Congress(R) led by Indira and the Congress(O) led by Kamaraj. The split was in many ways a left-right one, with Indira whipping up populism against the established party elites. The Forward Bloc did in some ways welcome the new developments. It appreciated Indira&#x27;s stands and reformulated its anti-Congress line to focus mainly opposition to the traditional Congress elite (i.e., the Congress(O)). In the 1969 presidential elections, AIFB supported Indira&#x27;s candidate V.V. Giri. This caused an abrupt break-up of the Swatantra-AIFB alliance in Tamil Nadu, as the Swatantra Party sought to align itself with the Congress(O).

===1971–72 elections===
On 20 February, just ahead of the 1971 general elections, the All India Forward Bloc chairman Hemantha Kumar Bose was murdered in Calcutta. An emergency central committee meeting was held on 24 February, which appointed P.K. Mookiah Thevar as the new chairman of the party.

In the 1971 Lok Sabha election, the Forward Bloc launched 24 candidates around the country. Two were elected, P.K. Mookiah Thevar from Ramanathapuram and Jambuwantrao Dhote from Nagpur. The party contested three seats in the interior of Maharashtra, where it performed well. Dhote, who was then known as &quot;Vidarbha ka Sher&quot; (the Lion of Vidarbha), had joined the Forward Bloc and campaigned for a separate Vidarbha state with the Forward Bloc as his platform. Dhote was hugely popular in the region at the time, and could draw crowds of hundreds of thousands to his meetings.

In Tamil Nadu, the party contested one seat, Ramanathapuram, with the support of its allies in the Progressive Front (most notably the Congress(R) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam). Meanwhile, the Forward Bloc played an important role in securing Mukkulathor votes for its Progressive Front allies.

In West Bengal, the party contested 10 Lok Sabha seats. The party obtained some significant voting in constituencies like Cooch Behar (22.17%) and Birbhum (19.70%), but in general it was defeated by the CPI(M) candidates.

Moreover, the party contested three seats in Bihar, one in Haryana, one in Madhya Pradesh, four in Uttar Pradesh and one in Delhi. In total, the candidates of the party obtained 962,971 votes (0.66% of the national vote).

In the 1971 state legislative assembly election in Odisha, the party contested four seats. It got 8393 votes (0.19% of the statewide vote), but was not close to winning any seat. In Tamil Nadu, the party contested nine seats in the southern part of the state within the framework of the Progressive Front. Out of these nine candidates, seven won. In total, its vote stood at 268,721 (1.71% of the statewide vote). One of its candidates came second and in the Mudukulathur constituency (that had been the centre of the violent 1957 Ramnad riots) the AIFB candidate R. Rathina Thevar came third with 17244 votes (31.02%). The most spectacular victory was that of P.K. Mookiah Thevar (who contested Lok Sabha and assembly elections simultaneously) who got 49292 votes (74.46%) in the Usilampatti constituency, defeating S. Andi Thevar of the Revolutionary Forward Bloc. Lastly in West Bengal the party contested 52 constituencies, but could only win three seats. Its vote stood at 374 141 (2.90% of the statewide vote).

On 28 March 1972, the party was able to win a seat in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (the upper house of the state assembly) for the first time. R. Sakthi Mohan was elected with the votes of the AIFB, DMK, PSP, Muslim League and the Tamil Arasu Kazhagam.

In the 1972 state legislative assembly election, the Forward Bloc presented one candidate in Assam, five in Bihar and two in Madhya Pradesh. In Maharashtra, the party contested 26 seats. Like in the 1971 Lok Sabha elections, the party did well in the interior areas of the state. It won the Nagpur North and Yeotmal seats, and came second in several others. In total, the AIFB candidates in Maharashtra got 363 547 votes (2.4% of the statewide vote). In West Bengal, where fresh elections to the state assembly were again held in 1972, the Forward Bloc launched 18 candidates. It got 331 244 votes (2.48% of the statewide vote), but could not win a single seat.

===Realignment in Tripura===
After having contested the 1972 elections on its own, the Forward Bloc decided to join a &#x27;United Front&#x27; led by the communist parties in Tripura. The front demanded clear-cut policies for procurement and distribution of food grains, stopping spiralling prices of essential commodities, a land reform legislation for delimitation of Tribal reserve areas and creation of employment opportunities for the unemployed. A 24-hour Tripura Bandh was organised by the front on 16 December. On 3 May 1974 the four parties organised a 12-hour Tripura Bandh.

===1977 elections===
Nineteen seventy seven was a crucial year in Indian political history. For the first time in independent India, the Congress Party was routed in a national election. The Forward Bloc had contested four seats in the Lok Sabha election. In West Bengal, it had three candidates which were supported by the Left Front, out of whom all three were elected. Moreover, the party contested one seat in Haryana.

In Tripura, a Left Front was formed consisting of the CPI(M), RSP and the Forward Bloc. The Front launched one Forward Bloc candidate, Brajagopal Roy in the Town Bordowali constituency. Roy won the seat with 7m800 votes (62.76%). In the beginning of 1978, the Left Front formed a majority government in the state, with Brajagopal Roy appointed minister in the state government.

===Recent history===
Ahead of the 2000 Bihar legislative election, AIFB took part in building a front together with the Bharatiya Jan Congress, the Bihar Vikas Party, the Janata Dal (Secular), the Samajwadi Janata Party and the Nationalist Congress Party. The front vowed to maintain equidistance towards the two major blocs in Bihari politics, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the National Democratic Alliance, condemning them as &#x27;casteist and communal&#x27;.

In 2002, AIFB was one of four left-wing parties that nominated Lakshmi Sahgal as a candidate for the presidency of India. Sehgal, who challenged the main candidate A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, got around 10% of the votes.

In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the party received 0.4% of votes and three seats (All from West Bengal).

Just before the 2006 Tamil Nadu legislative election, the party was joined by the actor Karthik. Karthik was given the post of president of the Tamil Nadu state unit by the national party leadership and was put in charge of the election campaign of the party in the state. The party decided to contest a large number of seats without joining either of the two major political blocs in Tamil Nadu. The appointment of Karthik as the new leader of the state unit provoked the sole Forward Bloc legislator and secretary of the state unit, L. Santhanam, to leave the party. In the election the party lost its representation in the assembly. A few months later, the party leadership expelled Karthik on the grounds of &#x27;anti-party activities&#x27;.

Ahead of the 2006 West Bengal legislative election, a section of the party led by Jayanta Roy, former AIFB Rajya Sabha member, and Chhaya Ghosh, former West Bengal Minister of Agriculture, broke away and formed the Indian People&#x27;s Forward Bloc. This party aligned itself with the Indian National Congress. The Bharatiya Forward Bloc, a former Forward Bloc splinter group, merged into the All India Forward Bloc prior to the 2006 election.

===Tripura===
The Forward Bloc established its presence in Tripura in 1944, founded by Kamala Ranjan Talapatra. Bengali immigrants like Sailesh Sen, Gopi Ballav Saha, Dwijen Deu, Anil Dasgupta, Hiren Nandi and Sati Bhardwaz are the other active members of the party. They took part in various political campaigns. However, around 1955–1956 most of the founding core of the party in Tripura joined the RSP. Today, AIFB is a member of opposition Left Front coalition. In the 2003 Tripura legislative election the Tripura State Committee president Brajagopal Roy contested the Town Borowali constituency on behalf of the Left Front. Roy got 9844 votes (43.57%), but was defeated by a Congress candidate. The AIFB state unit publishes Tripura Bani.

<doc id="408262" wikidata="Q1418204" url="?curid=408262" title="Instrument rating">
<text>Instrument rating refers to the qualifications that a pilot must have in order to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR). It requires specific training and instruction beyond what is required for a private pilot certificate or commercial pilot certificate, including rules and procedures specific to instrument flying, additional instruction in meteorology, and more intensive training in flight solely by reference to instruments.

==Training and testing==
Testing consists of a written exam and a practical test (also known as a check ride in the US, or a flight test in other countries). The check ride is divided into an oral component (certain countries only) to verify that the applicant understands the theory of instrument flying and an actual flight to ensure the pilot possesses the practical skills required for safe IFR flight.

For most private pilots, the most significant value of flying under IFR is the ability to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (such as inside clouds or days with poor visibility). Additionally, all flights operating in Class A airspace must be conducted under IFR. In the United States, an instrument rating is required when operating under special visual flight rules (SVFR) at night.

==Requirements==
Requirements for an instrument rating in the United States are listed in section 61.65 of the Federal Aviation Regulation are:
* 50 hours of Pilot in Command cross country
* 40 hours of simulated or actual instrument time
* 15 hours of flight instruction towards instrument rating

The Canadian license VFR-Over-the-Top (VFR OTT) allows private as well as commercial pilots to cross IMC areas when start and end of the trip is performed under VFR conditions.

In the UK, private pilots can attend a less intensive training to the Instrument Rating (Restricted) rating, restricted to the national airspace. This does not confer the privileges of a full Instrument Rating, but allows flight in IMC outside class A airspace, and flight on a SVFR clearance with in-flight visibility below 10 km (but more than 3 km).

An instrument rating test can be taken in either single or multi engine aircraft, with the qualification awarded being known as an SEIR or MEIR respectively. A pilot may be qualified to fly multi engine aircraft, but only hold a SEIR - in which case he/she would only be allowed to fly SE aircraft in IMC. To upgrade to a MEIR, further training and another check ride would be required. An MEIR holder is automatically granted SEIR privileges.

In addition, under EASA, an instrument rating is issued as either single pilot (SP) or multi pilot (MP) and must be re-validated separately every 12 months. Typically, a pilot will get their first SP MEIR on a light piston twin, then when they move to an airline, they will get an MP MEIR as part of their type rating training. If they do not re-validate their SP MEIR, they could find themselves in the position of being allowed to fly IFR in a jet but not a piston.

<text>Civic Coalition ARI (, CC-ARI), until October 2009 known as Support for an Egalitarian Republic (, ARI), is a centrist political party in Argentina founded in 2002 by Elisa Carrió.

It is a member of Cambiemos since 2015, along with centrist and centre-right parties.

Many consider it a social liberal and an innovative party. It offers a political option located in the centre, where the defense of republican institutions and democratic freedoms prevails. It groups together modern social democrats, who accept the &quot;Fundamentals of the economy&quot; and publicly condemn the dictatorship of Fidel Castro; together with democratic liberals, supporters of civil liberties that clearly separate them from conservatives, primarily defenders of the rule of law and pragmatists.

== Creation and history ==
Elisa Carrió, a former Radical Civic Union (UCR) politician, created the ARI after the breakup of the government alliance that brought Fernando de la Rúa to the presidency in 1999.

The 2001 elections gave ARI 17 of the 257 seats in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, and one senator. Carrió got a 14.1% share of the vote in the 2003 presidential elections. In the 2005 elections, ARI won eight seats. In the 2007 elections, ARI won the governorship of the deep-south Province of Tierra del Fuego, when Fabiana Rios, an ARI deputy, defeated the pro-government candidate Hugo Cóccaro, on June 24, 2007. Tierra del Fuego is currently (as of 2008) the first and only province ruled by ARI.

The party has established itself as a major force in the City of Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires Province, and in the aforementioned Province of Tierra del Fuego.

In the presidential elections of 2007, Carrió came second, heading the Civic Coalition with Rubén Giustiniani. She obtained about 23% of the vote, coming in a second behind Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. She won the majority vote in two of the three largest cities of Argentina: Buenos Aires and Rosario, but she suffered a larger defeat in Buenos Aires Province, the most populated district, and could not force a run-off election. ARI did however win four Senate seats (2 of the City of Buenos Aires and 2 of Tierra del Fuego) and a considerable number of seats in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, with further Congress seats for other members of the Coalition.

===Current status===
On 31 January 2015, through their personal accounts on social networks, Mauricio Macri and Elisa Carrió simultaneously announced that they &quot;sealed the unity.&quot; Each one headed a formula of his same party in the primaries of August; the winner of the internship competed in the national generals on October.

== 2007 split ==
As part of building a broader coalition ahead of the 2007 elections, Carrió reached out to centre-right figures such as Patricia Bullrich and María Eugenia Estenssoro, who was elected Senator for Buenos Aires. This proved controversial in ARI ranks and some national legislators formed a separate block called the Autonomous ARI in Congress. In May 2008, the block, led by Eduardo Macaluse, announced that they were forming a new party, Solidarity and Equality (&quot;Solidaridad e Igualdad – SI&quot;). Others who left ARI were Carlos Raimundi, Leonardo Gorbacz, Delia Bisutti, Nélida Belous, Verónica Venas, Emilio García Méndez, Lidia Naim and María América González. Senator María Rosa Díaz also appeared at the launch of SI. Several of the legislators that created the new party had won their seats in the 2007 election as part of the Civic Coalition, which they later opposed. The ARI deputies from Tierra del Fuego sit with the SI members in a separate block in the Chamber of Deputies. Subsequently, Senators María Rosa Díaz and José Carlos Martínez left ARI altogether in March 2009.

In October 2009, the official name was changed into &quot;Partido Coalición Cívica para la Afirmación de una República Igualitaria&quot; (Civic Coalition Party for the Support of an Egalitarian Republic). Usually it is shortened to &quot;Coalición Cívica ARI&quot; (Civic Coalition ARI).

==Ideology and values==
According to Maximiliano Ferraro, its national chairman, &quot;the &quot;Civic Coalition&quot; and Lilita Carrió represent values and ideas that are linked to the republic, liberal democracy, humanism, the ethics of otherness and ecumenism.&quot;

Elisa Carrió is considered a liberal, Christian and heterodox politician in Argentina.

Gregorio Hernández Maqueda, chairman of CC-ARI in the province of Córdoba, declared that his vigilance is the fulfillment of the maximum alliance agreed by the people and for the people: the Constitution. He affirms that the other side of poverty is not lack of resources or wars, but corruption. He believes that Mauricio Macri has achieved a government that &quot;brought freedom where there was only authoritarianism, truth where there was only lies and hope where there was only resignation.&quot;

In the Civic Coalition, of its 10 members, only one Juan Manuel López voted in favor of legalization of abortion. The most outraged by the result of the vote was Elisa Carrió, who threatened to break the coalition. His words fell lousy in the leadership of Cambiemos.

Being an opponent, during the conflict between ruralists and the government, Carrió said that the &quot;way out is the countryside.&quot;

<doc id="408264" wikidata="Q123585" url="?curid=408264" title="Radical Civic Union">
<text>The Radical Civic Union (, UCR) is a major political party in Argentina. It has reached the national government on ten occasions, making it one of the most historically important parties in the country. Ideologically, the party has stood for radicalism, secularism and universal suffrage. Especially during the 1970s and 1980s, it was perceived as a strong advocate for human rights. Its factions however, have been more heterogeneous, ranging from conservative liberalism to social democracy. 

Founded in 1891 by Leandro N. Alem, it is the second oldest political party active in Argentina. The party&#x27;s main support has long come from the middle class. On many occasions, the UCR was in opposition to Peronist governments and declared illegal during military rule. Since 1995 it has been a member of the Socialist International (an international organisation of social democrat political parties). 

The UCR had different fractures, conformations, incarnations and factions, through which the party ruled the country seven times with the presidencies of Hipólito Yrigoyen (1916-1922 and 1928-1930), Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear (1922-1928), Arturo Frondizi (1958-1962), Arturo Illia (1963-1966), Raúl Alfonsín (1983-1989) and Fernando de la Rúa (1999-2001). After 2001, the party has been particularly fragmented. As the Justicialist Party led by Nestor and Cristina Kirchner moved to the left, the UCR aligned itself with anti-Peronist centre-right parties.

From 2015 to 2023, the UCR was a member of the centre-right Cambiemos / Juntos por el Cambio coalition, along with Republican Proposal and Civic Coalition ARI, and supported Mauricio Macri in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections. For the 2023 elections, the party supported the candidacy of Patricia Bullrich. The party is not currently in any coalition since Juntos por el Cambio&#x27;s dissolution in 2023.

== History ==
The party was a breakaway from the Civic Union, which was led by Bartolomé Mitre and Leandro Alem. The term &#x27;radical&#x27; in the party&#x27;s name referred to its demand for universal male suffrage, which was considered radical at the time, when Argentina was ruled by an exclusive oligarchy and government power was allocated behind closed doors.

The party unsuccessfully led an attempt to force the early departure of President Miguel Juárez Celman in the Revolution of the Park (&quot;Revolución del Parque&quot;). Eventually a compromise was reached with Juárez Celman&#x27;s government. Hardliners who opposed this agreement founded the current UCR, led by Alem&#x27;s nephew, the young and charismatic Hipólito Yrigoyen. In 1893 and 1905, the party led unsuccessful revolutions to overthrow the government.

With the introduction of free, fair and confidential voting in elections based on universal adult male suffrage in 1912, the Party managed to win the general elections of 1916, when Hipólito Yrigoyen became president. As well as backing more popular participation, UCR&#x27;s platform included promises to tackle the country&#x27;s social problems and eradicate poverty. Yrigoyen&#x27;s presidency however turned out to be rather dictatorial; he refused to cooperate with the Congress and UCR in government fell short of the democratic expectations it had raised when in opposition.

The UCR remained in power during the next 14 years: Yrigoyen was succeeded by Marcelo T. de Alvear in 1922 and again by himself in 1928. The first coup in Argentina&#x27;s modern history occurred on September 6, 1930, and ousted an aging Yrigoyen amid an economic crisis resulting from the United States&#x27; Great Depression.

From 1930 to 1958, the UCR was confined to be the main opposition party, either to the Conservatives and the military during the 1930s and the early 1940s or to the Peronists during the late 1940s and early 1950s.

It was only in 1958 that a faction of the party allied with banned Peronists (in the Intransigent Radical Civic Union founded in 1956, splitting from what then called itself the People&#x27;s Radical Civil Union) came back to power, led by Arturo Frondizi. The growing tolerance of Frondizi towards his Peronist allies provoked unrest in the army, which ousted the president in March 1962.

After a brief military government, presidential elections took place in 1963 with the Peronist Party banned (as in 1958). The outcome saw the candidate of the People&#x27;s Radical Civic Union (the other party&#x27;s faction) Arturo Illia coming first but with only 25% of the votes (approximately 19% of the votes were blank ballots returned by Peronists owing to their party being banned). Although Argentina experienced during Illia&#x27;s presidency one of the most successful periods of history in terms of economic performance, the president was ousted by the army in June 1966. Illia&#x27;s peaceful and ordered style of governing — sometimes considered too &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; - was heavily criticized at the time.

During the 1970s, Peronist government (1973–1976), the UCR was the second-most supported party, but this didn&#x27;t actually grant the party the role of being the political opposition. In fact, the Peronist government&#x27;s most important criticisms came from the same Peronist Party (now called Justicialist Party). The UCR&#x27;s leader in those times, Ricardo Balbín, saluted Peron&#x27;s coffin (Perón had died on July 1, 1974, during his third mandate as president) with the famous sentence &quot;This old adversary salutes a great friend&quot;, thus marking the end of the Peronist-radical rivalry that had marked the pace of the Argentine political scene until then. The growing fight between left-wing and right-wing Peronists took the country into chaos and many UCR members were targeted by both factions. The subsequent coup in 1976 ended Peronist rule.

During the military regime, many members of the UCR were &quot;disappeared&quot;, as were members of other parties.

Between 1983 and 1989, its leader, Raúl Ricardo Alfonsín, was the first democratically elected president after the military dictatorship headed by generals such as Jorge Videla, Leopoldo Galtieri and Reynaldo Bignone. Alfonsín was succeeded by Carlos Saúl Menem of the Peronist Justicialist Party (PJ).

The election of Mr. Alfonsin, who campaigned hard for clean government and civil rights, represented a fundamental change toward genuine democracy in Argentina.

In 1997, the UCR participated in elections in coalition with Front for a Country in Solidarity (FREPASO), itself an alliance of many smaller parties.

This strategy brought Fernando de la Rúa to the presidency in the 1999 elections. During major riots triggered by economic reforms implemented by the UCR government (with the advice of the International Monetary Fund), President de la Rúa resigned and fled the country to prevent further turmoil. After three consecutive acting presidents assumed and resigned their duties in the following weeks, Eduardo Duhalde of the PJ took office until new elections could be held.

After the 2001 legislative elections, the party lost and became the second-largest party in the federal Chamber of Deputies, winning 71 of 257 seats. It campaigned in an alliance with the smaller, more leftist FREPASO.

The party has subsequently declined markedly and its candidate for president in 2003, Leopoldo Moreau, gained just 2.34% of the vote, beaten by three Peronists and more seriously, by two former radicals, Ricardo López Murphy of Recrear and Elisa Carrió of ARI, who have leached members, support and profile from the UCR. Since Nestor Kirchner&#x27;s led peronist PJ switched into political left, the UCR start to alliance with center-right anti-peronists.

In the 2005 legislative elections, the UCR was reduced to 35 deputies and 13 senators, but remains the second force in Argentine politics.

Ahead of the 2007 election, the remaining Radicals divided, between those who wanted to find an internal candidate and those who wanted to back a candidate from another movement, mostly former economy minister Roberto Lavagna, supported by former president Raúl Alfonsín.

In May 2005, the National Committee of the UCR, then led by Ángel Rozas, intervened (suspended of authorities of) the Provincial Committee of the UCR in Tierra del Fuego Province after Radical governor Jorge Colazo spoke in favour of Kirchner&#x27;s reelection. The intervention was rejected by the Provincial Committee.

A party convention held in Rosario in August 2006 officially rejected the possibility of alliances with Kirchner&#x27;s faction of Justicialism and granted former Party President Roberto Iglesias the permission to negotiate with other political forces. This led to several months of talks with Lavagna.

The continued dissidence of the &quot;Radicales K&quot; prompted the intervention of the UCR Provincial Committee of Mendoza on 1 November 2006, due to the public support of President Kirchner by Mendoza&#x27;s governor, the Radical Julio Cobos. The measure was short-lived, as the Mendoza Province Electoral Justice overturned it three days later. Deputy and UCR National Committee Secretary General Margarita Stolbizer stated that the party is virtually &quot;broken due to the stance of the leaders who support the alliance [with Kirchner]&quot;.

Roberto Iglesias eventually resigned the presidency of the party in November 2006 due to differences with Lavagna, having reached the conclusion that an alliance with him would be a mistake, and joined Stolbizer&#x27;s camp, maintaining that the party should look for its own candidate (the so-called &quot;Radicales R&quot;). On 1 December 2006 the National Committee appointed Jujuy Province Senator Gerardo Morales as its new president. Morales stated that he wanted to follow the mandate of the Rosario convention (that is, looking for a possible alliance with Roberto Lavagna).

Morales went on to become Lavagna&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election of October 2007, coming third. Although this campaign represented the mainstream of the national UCR leadership, substantial elements backed other candidates, notably the &quot;Radicales K&quot;. Cobos was elected vice president as the running mate of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner through the Plural Consensus alliance, and several Radicals were elected to Congress as part of the Kirchners&#x27; Front for Victory faction. The official UCR ranks in Congress were reduced to 30 in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies and 10 in the Argentine Senate.

In recent years, the UCR has been riven by an internal dispute between those who oppose and those who support the left-wing policies of Peronist President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor Néstor Kirchner. However, most &quot;Radicales K&quot; support for the Kirchners ended by mid 2008, when Vice President Julio Cobos opposed the Government bill on agricultural export taxes. He later rejoined UCR, becoming a prominent figure in the opposition, despite being still the Vice President.

The UCR joined the Civic and Social Agreement to run for the 2009 elections. The loose coalition obtained 29% of the national votes and came a close second to the Front for Victory and allies national outcomes. The Party&#x27;s reorganization, as well as the 2009 elections, resulted in a gain of party representatives in the National Congress.

In 2015, the UCR formed a coalition with Republican Proposal, a center-right political party, to form Cambiemos. Cambiemos won the presidential election, which ended its 12 years of opposition. The alliance with Republican Proposal was criticized by the Socialist International and the Young Radicals were suspended from the International Union of Socialist Youth.

==Ideology and factions==
The UCR is generally classified as a centrist, or liberal. Due to its heterogeneity, the UCR has also been described as a big tent or catch-all party and social-liberal party, but it is also occasionally classified as a social-democratic. Radicals call themselves the party of civil liberties, democracy and the Constitution. In their history, they resisted authoritarian regimes, won universal suffrage and starred in the struggle for the causes of the popular majorities.

Raúl Alfonsín thought that radicalism advocated social democracy. He wanted to form a &quot;broad popular, democratic, reformist and national movement&quot;; to end privilege, authoritarianism and demagoguery and consolidate an authentic social democracy in the country. He also explained that Radicals do not define themselves, as European political parties usually do, on the left–right political spectrum, as radicalism is an ethic before being an ideology. However, according to Alfonsín, Radicals felt very comfortable as &quot;observers&quot; of all the tendencies that make up European social democracy. Moreover, in 1995 Raúl Alfonsín brought radicalism into the world organization of center-left parties, the Socialist International. Another former leader, Angel Rozas, defined the political-ideological identity of the party as humanist and center-left. He and his faction gave a progressive look to the party.

On the conservative side of the party sat Ricardo Balbín. The party was particularly divided since the 1960s and again since the end of the 1990s. After Balbín&#x27;s death, Fernando de la Rúa who gave a neoliberal and conservative tint to the party and who famously said that &quot;we are radicals, not socialists&quot;, kept UCR conservatives active until he became president in 1999.

During the 1989 general election, Eduardo Angeloz promised a &quot;red pencil&quot; to cut public deficit spending and mentioned the possible privatization of state companies, which would later be carried out by his rival, the Peronist Carlos Menem.

Since de la Rúa&#x27;s demise in 2001, the UCR has become more and more fragmented politically and geographically. Besides the interventions in Tierra del Fuego and Mendoza, in September 2006, the party leaders had admitted that they reviewing requests of intervention against the provincial committees of Río Negro and Santiago del Estero. In Santa Fe, the UCR had teamed up with the Socialist Party to support Socialist candidate for governor Hermes Binner, in exchange for the vice-governorship, taken by the former governor Aldo Tessio&#x27;s daughter, the &quot;fiscal federal&quot; Griselda Tessio, winning the 2007 elections.

The Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) has gradually shifted toward center-right positions since the 2005 legislative elections, due to internal divisions and the exclusion of the Alfonsinismo from its ranks. This political process has led the UCR to adopt a more conservative orientation in its focus and ideological alignment. According to the president of the party, now within the organization we can find a centrist sector and another linked to right-wing values.

== Leaders ==
The UCR is headed by a National Committee; its president is the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the party. A national convention brings together representatives of the provincial parties and affiliated organisations such as Franja Morada and Radical Youth, and is itself represented on the National Committee.

== Focus: Yrigoyen presidency ==
In 1903, Hipólito Yrigoyen began to reorganize the UCR for a new revolution. Two years after he led the armed uprising known as the Revolution of 1905, which although it failed to put sufficient pressure on the official party, it was able to cause a party breakdown.

The more progressive leaders of the autonomists, such as Carlos Pellegrini and Roque Sáenz Peña, began to support that it was necessary to make institutional changes to hold back the growth of social and political conflict.

When Roque Sáenz Peña was elected president in 1910, the UCR already was not in the position to carry out new assembled uprisings, but the general belief that existed was that a revolution was imminent. Saénz Peña y Yrigoyen, who had been maintaining a personal friendship from childhood, they then had a private meeting in which they agreed to sanction a law of free suffrage. Two years later, in 1912, they approved the law of universal secret, and obligatory voting for men, known as The Sáenz Peña Law. On the other hand, it was also the first Argentinian political party to present a legal project for women to vote in 1919, that eventually did not pass given the conservative majority in Congress. Gabino Ezeiza was a great Payador, and he musically described the popular culture in favor of Yrigoyen.

The UCR put an end to their electoral political abstention, and went to the parliamentary elections, without forming electoral alliances. For the first time in Argentina, they voted in a voting booth to guarantee a secret ballot.The predictable vote, the secret vote, and democracy. Before 1912, Argentina was using an electoral system in which votes were expressed verbally, or by ticket, in public place, and in a voluntary way, called the &quot;predictable vote&quot;, which broke the electoral system. The struggle for democracy in Argentina, not related initially as much with universal suffrage but with the secret vote, in a voting booth, which made independent the wish of the voter from all external pressures. The Sáenz Peña Law of 1912 established the secret and obligatory vote, but due to the fact that it did not recognize the right of women to vote or to be voters, it is incorrect to say that Argentina had a truly universal voting system until 1947.The UCR first won the elections to governor in Santa Fe (Manuel Menchaca), from which followed a trail of triumphs in the rest of the country.

Among the radical leaders at this time were: José Camilo Crotto (CF), Leopoldo Melo (CF), Vicente Gallo (CF), Fernando Saguier (CF), Marcelo T. de Alvear (CF), José L. Cantilo (CF), Delfor del Valle (PBA), Horacio Oyhanarte (PBA), Rogelio Araya (SF), Rodolfo Lehmann (SF), Enrique Mosca (SF), Elpidio González (CBA), Pelagio Luna (LR), Miguel Laurencena (ER), José Néstor Lencinas (Mza), Federico Cantoni (SJ).

The electoral triumphs of radicalism caused the collapse of the parties from the prior political system to the Sáenz Peña Law. The UCR auto-dispersed due to an initiative of Honorio Pueyrredón and its members massively joined radicalism. The National Autonomist Party dissolved.

On 2 April 1916, for the first time in Argentinian history, they carried out the presidential elections by means of a secret ballot. The UCR obtained 370,000 votes, against the 340,000 votes of all the other parties and in the Electoral College their way was put to a vote. Due to this, a long cycle of 14 consecutive years of radical government ensued. The Radical UCR won the presidential elections on three successive occasions: Hipólito Yrigoyen (1916-1922), Marcelo T. de Alvear (1922-1928), and Hipólito Yrigoyen once again (1928-1930). The series of radical governments would be violently interrupted by means of a military coup on December 6, 1930. The secret vote opened a new chapter in Argentinian History.

The government of the UCR indicated the arrival of the government and the direction of the state organization of members of the medial sects that until this moment were indeed excluded from these functions.

The first presidency of Hipólito Yrigoyen promoted a series of politics of a new type, which in conjunction was signaling a transformative nationalist tendency, between that which emphasized the creation of the state-owned oil business YPF, the new rural laws, the fortification of the public railways, the Reform University, and a strongly autonomous political exterior for the greatest improvements.

On the matter of labor, he propelled several laws for workers such as the law of the 8 hour work day and the law of Sunday rest, and he intervened as a neutral mediator in the conflicts between labor unions and big companies. However, during his time in government, several large worker massacres such as the Tragic Week, La Forestral massacre, and the Firing Squad Executions of Patagonia occurred, with thousands of workers killed. The historian Halperín Donghi explains that the radical governments resolved the problem of regional equality in Argentina, but as a consequence of this, they brought social inequalities to a higher level at the same time. This is because radicalism was lacking solutions for the people on the bottom of the social hierarchy, through systematically neglecting class differences.

Radicalism, during the first government of Yrigoyen, was in the minority in Congress: In the Deputy Chamber 45 members were radicals and 70 opposers, while amongst the 30 members of the Senate 4 were radicals. Nonetheless, Yrigoyen kept up an anti-accord force and a slightly inflammatory conversation and negotiation, not only with the traditional conservative parties that were controlling the senate, but also with the new popular parties that had gained leadership from the secret ballot: the Socialist Party and the Democratic Progressive party. Also, Yrigoyen took forward a political system of interventions to the provinces and a style of personal and direct management, that would be severely critical for his opposition both inside and outside of the UCR, calling it &quot;personalism&quot;.

<text>The Front for a Country in Solidarity ( or ) was a center-left political coalition in Argentina. Its leading figures were José Octavio Bordón, Carlos &quot;Chacho&quot; Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide.

==History==
The coalition was formed in 1994 out of the Broad Front (&quot;Frente Grande&quot;), which had been founded mainly by progressive members of the Peronist Justicialist Party who denounced the neoliberal policies and alleged corruption of the Carlos Menem administration; the Broad Front joined with other dissenting Peronists, the Unidad Socialista (Popular and Democratic Socialist Party) and several other leftist parties and individuals.

Shortly after its foundation, the coalition contested the 1995 elections, with José Octavio Bordón running for president with Carlos &quot;Chacho&quot; Álvarez as running mate. While the coalition didn&#x27;t win the election, the campaign was considered nonetheless very successful for a newly-formed alliance, as Bordón came second with 29,3% of the vote. Subsequently, Bordón proposed converting FrePaSo into a unified party, while Álvarez wanted a loose confederation of different parties. On May 17, 1995, Bordón and Álvarez announced the formation of a confederation, with a unified political platform and leadership, with the third largest block in the Argentine National Congress. The Intransigent Party and the Christian Democratic Party joined the coalition. Bordón later resigned after a leadership battle and returned to the Justicialist Party.

The FrePaSo campaigned for the 1999 elections in an alliance with the larger Radical Civic Union (UCR) and a few provincial parties, the Alliance for Work, Justice, and Education (known simply as the Alliance), which won the presidency for Fernando de la Rúa. Frepaso politician Aníbal Ibarra was elected Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2000 on the Alliance ticket. However, that same year vice president Chacho Álvarez resigned amidst public intra-party accusations of bribery in the Senate, followed shortly after by other leading members.

After the 2001 elections, FrePaSo became the joint third largest party in the federal Chamber of Deputies, with 17 of 257 deputies.

Following the December 2001 riots, the party disintegrated. Many members re-joined the Peronist movement within the centre-left Front for Victory faction of President Néstor Kirchner, with others supporting the ARI party of Elisa Carrió. Until 2007 the party nominally retained one senator, Vilma Ibarra, who sat as a lone &#x27;Party for Victory&#x27; member but in practice supported the Front for Victory, for which she became a national deputy in 2007. Her brother Aníbal Ibarra was removed as Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2006 in the wake of the Cromañón nightclub fire.

<text>Jean-Pierre Aumont (born Jean-Pierre Philippe Salomons; 5 January 1911 – 30 January 2001) was a French film and theatre actor. He was a matinée idol and a leading man during the 1930s, but his burgeoning career was interrupted by the Second World War. He served in the Free French Forces, and receiving both the Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the Croix de Guerre for his actions.

After the war, Aumont resumed his career, in Hollywood as well as his native France, typically playing suave romantic leads. In 1991, he received an Honorary César for his contributions to the French film industry.

== Early life ==

Aumont was born Jean-Pierre Philippe Salomons in Paris, the son of Suzanne (née Cahen; 1885–1940), an actress, and Alexandre Salomons, owner of La Maison du Blanc (a linen department store). His mother&#x27;s uncle was well-known stage actor Georges Berr (died 1942). His father was from a Dutch-Jewish family; his mother&#x27;s family were French Jews. Aumont&#x27;s younger brother was the noted French film director François Villiers.

== Career ==

At age 16, Aumont began studying drama at the Paris Conservatory, where his mother also studied. His professional stage debut occurred at the age of 19. His film debut came one year later when &quot;Jean de la Lune&quot; (&quot;Jean of the Moon&quot;) was produced in 1931.

However, his most important, career-defining role came in 1934 when Jean Cocteau&#x27;s play &quot;La Machine infernale&quot; (&quot;The Infernal Machine&quot;), was staged. While his film and stage career began rising quickly, World War II began. Aumont remained in France until 1942 when he realized that as a Jew he would have to flee the Nazis. He migrated from the unoccupied zone of Vichy France to New York City, then to Hollywood, California to pursue his film career. 

He began working for MGM, but after finishing &quot;The Cross of Lorraine&quot;, he joined the Free French Forces. He was sent to North Africa, where he participated in Operation Torch in Tunisia. He then moved with the Allied armies through Italy and France. He was wounded twice. The first was on a mission with his brother; the second was more serious. Aumont&#x27;s Jeep was blown up near a land-mined bridge. General Diego Brosset, commander of the 1st Free French Division, to whom Aumont was aide de camp, was killed. For his bravery during the fighting, Aumont received the Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the Croix de Guerre.

After the war, Aumont quickly resumed his movie career, starring with Ginger Rogers in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1946) and as the magician in &quot;Lili&quot; (1953) with Leslie Caron. He worked with a number of prominent theatre director and stars, including his (then) wife Maria Montez. In the mid-1950s, Aumont began working in television, appearing on several anthology programs, such as &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and as a guest on the show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. In the 1960s and 1970s, he appeared in various theater productions, including the musicals &quot;Tovarich&quot; with Vivien Leigh, &quot;Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, and &quot;Gigi&quot;.

One of his later performances was in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1989). Two years later, in 1991, aged 80, he received an honorary César Award as well as being decorated with the cross of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres.

== Personal life ==

Aumont was married four times to three women. His first wife was French actress Blanche Montel, to whom he was married from 1938 to 1940, ultimately divorcing. While in Hollywood, Aumont married Maria Montez, a Dominican actress. She was known as the Queen of Technicolor, and their marriage was very happy. However, Montez drowned in her bathtub on 7 September 1951 after suffering an apparent heart attack at the family&#x27;s villa in Suresnes. Montez and Aumont had one child, a daughter, Tina (1946–2006).

In 1955, Aumont was dating Grace Kelly at the time she first met Prince Rainier III of Monaco. 

In 1956, Aumont married Italian actress Marisa Pavan. The couple starred in &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959), in which Pavan played the romantic interest of the lead, and Aumont appears as King Louis XVI. They divorced, but later remarried and remained together until his death. Aumont and Pavan had two sons, Jean-Claude and Patrick.

== Death ==
Jean-Pierre Aumont died 30 January 2001 of a heart attack in Gassin, France, aged 90, and was cremated.

<doc id="408270" wikidata="Q318657" url="?curid=408270" title="Armenian Revolutionary Federation">
<text>The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (, abbr. ARF (ՀՅԴ) or ARF-D), also known as Dashnaktsutyun (Armenian: Դաշնակցություն, lit. &quot;Federation&quot;), is an Armenian nationalist and socialist political party founded in 1890 in Tiflis, Russian Empire by Christapor Mikaelian, Stepan Zorian, and Simon Zavarian. , the party operates in Armenia, Lebanon, Iran and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is present. The party was also active in Artsakh until the Azerbaijani offensive in September 2023. Although it has long been the most influential political party in the Armenian diaspora, it has a comparatively smaller proportional presence in modern-day Armenia. , the party was represented in two national parliaments, with ten seats in the National Assembly of Armenia and three seats in the Parliament of Lebanon as part of the March 8 Alliance.

The ARF has traditionally advocated socialist democracy and has been a full member of the Socialist International since 2003; it joined the Second International in 1907. It has the largest membership of the political parties present in the Armenian diaspora, having established affiliates in more than 20 countries. Compared to other diasporan Armenian parties which tend to primarily focus on educational or humanitarian projects, the ARF is the most politically oriented of the organizations and traditionally has been one of the staunchest supporters of Armenian nationalism. The party campaigns for the recognition of the Armenian genocide and the right to reparations. It also advocates the establishment of United Armenia, partially based on the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920.

The ARF originated as a merger of various Armenian political groups, mainly from the Russian Empire, with the declared goal of achieving &quot;the political and economic freedom of Turkish Armenia&quot; by means of armed rebellion. In the 1890s, the party sought to unify the various small groups in the Ottoman Empire that were advocating reform and defending Armenian villages from the massacres and banditry that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. ARF members formed groups of partisans (&quot;fedayi&quot;) that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance. The party refrained from revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire until the decision of the Russian authorities to confiscate Armenian Church property in 1903. Initially restricting its demands to the establishment of autonomy and democratic rights for Armenians in the two empires, the party adopted an independent and united Armenia as part of its program in 1919.

In 1918, the party was instrumental in the formation of the First Republic of Armenia, which fell to the Soviet communists in 1920. After the communists exiled its leadership, the ARF established itself within Armenian-diaspora communities, where it helped Armenians to preserve their cultural identity. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the ARF reestablished its presence in Armenia. Prior to Serzh Sargsyan&#x27;s election as President of Armenia in February 2008 and for a short time thereafter, the ARF was a member of the governing coalition, even though it nominated its own candidate in the 2008 presidential elections.

ARF reentered Sargsyan&#x27;s cabinet in February 2016 in what was defined as a &quot;long-term political cooperation&quot; agreement with the Republican Party by means of which the ARF would share responsibility for all government policies. The ARF then approved of Sargsyan&#x27;s nomination in April 2018 as Prime Minister, from which post he resigned six days later (23 April 2018) amid large-scale protests in what came to be known as the Velvet Revolution. By the evening of 25 April 2018, ARF-Dashnaktsutyun had withdrawn from the coalition.

Following the Velvet Revolution, the party lost support from the general public in Armenia and is now being polled at 1–2%. The party lost political representation in the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election after receiving only 3.89% of the votes, which is lower than the 5% minimum threshold required for representation in the National Assembly.

During the 2020–2021 Armenian protests, the party confirmed it would participate in the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election as part of a political alliance - the Armenia Alliance - with Reborn Armenia. In the 2021 election, the Armenia Alliance, led by the second President of Armenia, Robert Kocharyan, won 21% of the popular vote and gained 29 seats in the National Assembly.

== Early history ==

In the late 19th century, the Russian Empire became the hub of small groups advocating reform in Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. In 1890, recognizing the need to unify these groups in order to be more efficient, Christapor Mikaelian, Simon Zavarian and Stepan Zorian created a new political party called the &quot;Federation of Armenian Revolutionaries&quot; (, Hay Heghapokhakanneri Dashnaktsutyun), which would eventually be called the &quot;Armenian Revolutionary Federation&quot; or &quot;Dashnaktsutiun&quot; in 1890.

The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, an existing Armenian socialist and revolutionary party, initially agreed to join the &quot;Federation of Armenian Revolutionaries.&quot; However, the Hunchaks soon withdrew due to disputes over ideological and organizational questions, such as the role of socialism in the party&#x27;s program. Another faction of non-socialists led by Konstantin Khatisian split from the federation early on. Despite this, the party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire and convened its First General Congress in 1892, where a program containing socialist principles was adopted. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire by means of armed rebellion. At the First Congress, the party adopted a decentralized &quot;modus operandi&quot; according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the democratic principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.

=== Russian Empire ===
The ARF gradually acquired significant strength and sympathy among Russian Armenians. Mainly because of the ARF&#x27;s stance towards the Ottoman Empire, the party enjoyed the support of the central Russian administration, as tsarist and ARF foreign policy had the same alignment until 1903. On 12 June 1903, the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong ARF opposition, because the ARF perceived the tsarist edict as a threat to the Armenian national existence. As a result, the ARF leadership decided to defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and by holding mass demonstrations. In 1904, the party broke with its old policy of non-struggle against the Tsarist authorities, engaging in acts of terrorism against the imperial bureaucracy and establishing separate schools, courts, and prisons in Russian Armenia.

In 1905–06, the Armenian-Tatar massacres broke out during which the ARF became involved in armed activities. Some sources claim that the Russian government incited the massacres in order to reinforce its authority during the revolutionary turmoil of 1905. The first outbreak of violence occurred in Baku, in February 1905. The ARF held the Russian authorities responsible for inaction and instigation of massacres that were part of a larger anti-Armenian policy. On 11 May 1905, Dashnak revolutionary Drastamat Kanayan assassinated Russian governor general , who was considered by the Armenian population as the main instigator of hate and confrontation between the Armenians and the Tatars. Unable to rely on the state for protection, the Armenian bourgeoisie turned to the ARF. Against the criticisms of their rivals to the left (the Hunchaks, Bolsheviks and Specifists), the Dashnak leaders argued that, given employment discrimination against Armenian workers in non-Armenian concerns, the defence provided to the Armenian bourgeoisie was essential to the safekeeping of employment opportunities for Armenian laborers. The Russian Tsar&#x27;s envoy in the Caucasus, Vorontsov-Dashkov, reported that the ARF bore a major portion of responsibilities for perpetrating the massacres. The ARF, however, argued that it helped to organize the defence of the Armenian population against Muslim attacks. The blows suffered at the hands of the Dashnakist fighting squads proved a catalyst for the consolidation of the Muslim community of the Caucasus. During that period, the ARF regarded armed activity, including terror, as necessary for the achievement of political goals.

In January 1912, 159 ARF members, being lawyers, bankers, merchants and other intellectuals, were tried before the Russian senate for their participation in the party. They were defended by then-lawyer Alexander Kerensky, who challenged much of the evidence used against them as the &quot;original investigators had been encouraged by the local administration to use any available means&quot; to convict the men. Kerensky succeeded in having the evidence reexamined for one of the defendants. He and several other lawyers &quot;made openly contemptuous declarations&quot; about this discrepancy to the Russian press, which was forbidden to attend the trials, and this in turn greatly embarrassed the senators. The Senate eventually opened an inquiry against the chief magistrate who had brought the charges against the Dashnak members and concluded that he was insane. Ninety-four of the accused were acquitted, while the rest were either imprisoned or exiled for varying periods, the most severe being six years.

=== Persian Empire ===
The Dashnaktsutiun held a meeting on 26 April 1907, dubbed the Fourth General Congress, at which ARF leaders such as Aram Manukian, Hamo Ohanjanyan and Stepan Stepanian discussed their engagement in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. They established that the movement was one that had political, ideological and economic components and was thus aimed at establishing law and order, human rights and the interests of all working people. They also felt that it would work for the benefit and interest of Armenian-Iranians. The final vote was 25 votes in favour and one absentia.

From 1907 to 1908, during the time when the Young Turks came to power in the Ottoman Empire, Armenians from the Caucasus, Western Armenia, and Iran started to collaborate with Iranian constitutionalists and revolutionaries. Political parties, notably the Dashnaktsutiun, wanted to influence the direction of the revolution towards greater democracy and to safeguard gains already achieved. The Dashnak contribution to the fight was mostly military, as it sent some of its well-known fedayees to Iran after the guerrilla campaign in the Ottoman Empire ended with the rise of the Young Turks. A notable ARF member already in Iran was Yeprem Khan, who had established a branch of the party in the country. Yeprem Khan was highly instrumental in the Constitutional revolution of Iran. After the Persian national parliament was shelled by the Russian Colonel Vladimir Liakhov, Yeprem Khan rallied with Sattar Khan and other revolutionary leaders in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran against Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar. Relations between Sattar Khan and the ARF oscillated between amity and resentment. Sometimes he was viewed as being ignorant, while at other times he was dubbed a great hero. Nonetheless, the ARF came to collaborate with him and alongside Yeprem Khan posted many victories including the capture of Rasht in February 1909. At the end of June 1909, the fighters arrived in Tehran and after several battles, took over the Majles building and the Sepahsalar Mosque. Yeprem Khan was then appointed chief of Tehran police. This caused tensions between the Dashnaks and Khan.

=== Ottoman Empire ===

==== Abdul Hamid Period (1894–1908) ====

The ARF became a major political force in Armenian life. It was especially active in the Ottoman Empire, where it organized or participated in many revolutionary activities. The ARF was especially influential due to their ability to educate the population through a system of &quot;educating, explaining,and encouraging&quot;. This was a tactic used to disseminate information to gain support in terms of political elections, campaigns, or alliances to strengthen the ARF&#x27;s social relations. When they weren&#x27;t educating their youth and preparing the new generation for revolution, they themselves were taking part in revolutionary activities. For example, in 1894, the ARF took part in the Sasun Resistance, supplying arms to the local population to help the people of Sasun defend themselves against the Hamidian purges. In June 1896, the Armenakan Party organized the Van Rebellion in the province of Van. The Armenakans, assisted by members of the Hunchakian and ARF parties, supplied all able-bodied men of Van with weapons. They rose to defend the civilians from the attack and subsequent massacre.

 To raise awareness of the massacres of 1895–96, members of the Dashnaktsutiun led by Papken Siuni, occupied the Ottoman Bank on 26 August 1896. The purpose of the raid was to dictate the ARF&#x27;s demands of reform in the Armenian populated areas of the Ottoman Empire and to attract European attention to their cause since the Europeans had many assets in the bank. The operation caught European attention but at the cost of more massacres by Sultan Abdul Hamid II.

During this period, many famous intellectuals joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, including Harutiun Shahrigian, Avetik Isahakyan, Hakob Zavriev, Levon Shant, Karekin Khajag, Vartkes Serengülian, Abraham Gyulkhandanyan, Vahan Papazian, Siamanto, Nikol Aghbalian and many others.

The Khanasor Expedition was performed by the Armenian militia against the Kurdish Mazrik tribe on 25 July 1897. During the Defense of Van, the Mazrik tribe had ambushed a squad of Armenian defenders and massacred them. The Khanasor Expedition was the ARF&#x27;s retaliation. Some Armenians consider this their first victory over the Ottoman Empire and celebrate each year in its remembrance.

On 30 March 1904, the ARF played a major role in the Second Sasun Uprising. The ARF sent arms and &quot;fedayi&quot; to defend the region for the second time. Among the 500 fedayees participating in the resistance were famed figures such as Kevork Chavush, Sepasdatsi Murad and Hrayr Djoghk. Although they managed to hold off the Ottoman army for several months, despite their lack of fighters and firepower, Ottoman forces captured Sasun and massacred thousands of Armenians.

In 1904, during an annual congress bringing together Armenian and Bulgarian representatives, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation decided to assassinate Sultan Abdul Hamid II in response to the Hamidian massacres. Pierre Quillard, a French anarchist linked with the ARF attended and reported to his anarchist colleagues that the Armenians intended to use &quot;extreme methods.&quot; One of Dashnaksutiun&#x27;s founders Kristapor Mikaelian was killed by an accidental explosion during the planning of the operation. In 1905, members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation organized the failed Yıldız Attempt, an assassination plot on Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul); the explosion missed its target by a few minutes and was helped by Belgian anarchist Edward Joris. He was arrested and sentenced to death, prompting Pierre Quillard to use his journal, &quot;Pro Armenia&quot;, to advocate for his release—a stance shared by his colleague Jean Grave in &quot;Les Temps nouveaux&quot;.

==== Young Turk Revolution (1908–14) ====

In the 1890s the party used terrorism against the Ottoman Empire and Russia with the goal of gaining an independent nation, more well known attacks occurred against Bedros Kapamajian, the mayor of Van who was assassinated in December 1912, and the assassination of archbishop Leon Tourian in New York City on December 24, 1933.

Together with the Committee of Union and Progress, a group of mostly European-educated Turks, the ARF had been one of the largest revolutionary groups trying to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In a general assembly meeting in 1907, the ARF acknowledged that the Armenian and Turkish revolutionaries had the same goals. Although the Tanzimat reforms had given Armenians more rights and seats in the parliament, the ARF hoped to gain autonomy to govern Armenian populated areas of the Ottoman Empire as a &quot;state within a state&quot;. The &quot;Second congress of the Ottoman opposition&quot; took place in Paris, France, in 1907. Opposition leaders including Ahmed Riza (liberal), Sabahheddin Bey, and ARF member Khachatur Maloumian attended. During the meeting, an alliance between the two parties was officially declared. The ARF decided to cooperate with the Committee of Union and Progress, hoping that if the Young Turks came to power, autonomy would be granted to the Armenians.

In 1908, Abdul Hamid II was overthrown during the Young Turk Revolution, which launched the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Dashnaktsutiun became a legal political party and Armenians gained more seats in the 1908 parliament, but the reforms fell short of the greater autonomy that the ARF had hoped for. The Adana massacre in 1909 also created antipathy between Armenians and Turks, and the ARF cut relations with the Young Turks in 1912. Between December 1912 and 1914 ARF politicians held negotiations with the CUP about political reforms in the eastern provinces. The Armenians had the support of the Russians and the CUP accused the Armenians that their actions caused further division between Turks and Armenians. The CUP and ARF continued a close cooperation throughout the Second Constitutional Era up until 1914.

=== World War I and the Armenian genocide ===
In 1915, Dashnak leaders were deported and killed alongside other Armenian intellectuals during a purge by Ottoman officials against the leaders of the empire&#x27;s Armenian communities. The ARF, maintaining its ideological commitment to a &quot;Free, Independent, and United Armenia&quot;, led the defense of the Armenian people during the Armenian genocide, becoming leaders of the successful Van Resistance. Jevdet Bey, the Ottoman administrator of Van, tried to suppress the resistance by killing two Armenian leaders (Ishkhan and Vramian) and trying to imprison Aram Manukian, who had risen to fame and gained the nickname &quot;Aram of Van&quot;. Moreover, on 19 April, he issued an order to exterminate all Armenians, and threatened to kill all Muslims who helped them.

About 185,000 Armenians lived in Vaspurakan. In the city of Van itself, there were around 30,000 Armenians, but more Armenians from surrounding villages joined them during the Ottoman offensive. The battle started on 20 April 1915, with Aram Manukian as the leader of the resistance, and lasted for two months. In May, the Armenian battalions and Russian regulars entered the city and successfully drove the Ottoman army out of Van. The Dashnaktsutiun was also involved in other less-successful resistance movements in Zeitun, Shabin-Karahisar, Urfa, and Musa Dagh. After the end of the Van resistance, ARF leader Aram Manukian became governor of the Administration for Western Armenia and worked to ease the sufferings of Armenians.

At the end of World War I, members of the Young Turks movement, considered executors of the Armenian genocide by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, were assassinated during Operation Nemesis.

=== Republic of Armenia (1918–1920) ===
As a result of the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Azerbaijani leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.

With the collapse of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to fend for themselves as the Turkish army approached the capital of Yerevan. At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of Yerevan. Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army. The opposing armies met on 28 May 1918, near Sardarapat. The battle was a major military success for the Armenian army as it was able to halt the invading Turkish forces. The Armenians also stood their ground at the Battle of Kara Killisse and at the Battle of Bash Abaran. The creation of the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party. However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.

The ARF, led by General Andranik, tried several times to seize Shusha (known as Shushi by Armenians), a city in Karabakh. Just before the Armistice of Mudros was signed, Andranik was on the way from Zangezur to Shusha, to control the main city of Karabakh. Andranik&#x27;s forces got within of the city when the First World War ended, and Turkey, along with Germany and Austria-Hungary, surrendered to the Allies. British forces ordered Andranik to stop all military advances, assuring him that the conflict would be solved with the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Andranik, not wanting to antagonize the British, retreated to Goris, Zangezur.

The Armenian Revolutionary Federation had a strong presence in the DRA government. Most of the important government posts, such as prime minister, defence minister and interior minister were controlled by its members.

The DRA wanted to recover the country&#x27;s economy, and create new rules and regulations, but the situation required it to focus on overcoming widespread hunger in the country. The situation was complicated externally, provoked by Turkish and Azerbaijani Muslim riots. In 1920 the situation in the country became worse, with apparent rapprochement between Soviet Russia and Kemal&#x27;s Turkey. When the Turkish-Armenian war started in autumn 1920, Armenia was isolated and abandoned by Western allies. The newly formed League of Nations did not provide any help. Soviet Russia intensified its pressure on Armenia. Losing the war, Armenia signed the Treaty of Alexandropol on 2 December 1920, which resulted in the recognition of large territorial losses to Turkey. The Armenia military-revolutionary committee formed in Soviet Azerbaijan. Despite their tight grip on power, the ARF ceded power to the Communist Red Army troops invading from the north, which culminated with a Soviet takeover. The ARF was banned, its leaders exiled, and many of its members dispersed to other parts of the world.

== Exile ==

After the communists took over the short-lived First Republic of Armenia and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the Armenian diaspora had settled. With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon and to a lesser extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states, including the USA, where a large number of Armenians had settled.

With political and geographic division came religious division. One part of the Armenian Church claimed it wanted to be separate from the head, whose seat was in Echmiadzin, Armenian SSR. Some Armenians in the US thought Moscow tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists&#x27; ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the Armenian Apostolic Church would not admit members of the ARF. This was one of the reasons why the ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia, from Lebanon to the US. In 1933, members of ARF were convicted in the assassination of Armenian archbishop Levon Tourian with large butcher knives in New York City. Prior to his murder, the archbishop had been accused of being exclusively pro-Soviet by the ARF. The ARF was legally exonerated of any direct involvement in the assassination, but the incident weakened the party in the United States and led to its members being ostracized by the other Armenian political parties.

During World War II, some ARF members, specifically those living in areas under German occupation, collaborated with Nazi Germany. However, this was not the position of the entire party, and the party bureau in Cairo declared its loyalty to the Allies. The Armenian Legion, composed largely of former Soviet Red Army POWs, was led by Drastamat Kanayan. It participated in the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and the North Caucasus. but was later based in the Netherlands and France a result of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s distrust of their loyalty. In 1942, the Nazi government recognized the Armenian National Council (), a collaborationist body directed against the Soviet Union whose vice-president was ARF member Abraham Gyulkhandanyan and whose members included ARF member Vahan Papazian and former ARF member Garegin Nzhdeh. The main motivation for this collaboration was likely a desire to protect Armenians living in the German-occupied areas and to protect Armenia from a potential Turkish invasion in the event of a German victory over the Soviet Union. 

During the 1950s, tensions arose between the ARF and the Armenian SSR. The death of Catholicos Garegin of the Holy See of Cilicia prompted a struggle for succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected Zareh of Aleppo. This decision was rejected by the Echmiadzin-based Catholicos of All Armenians, the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over a large part of the Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by his election. This event split the large Armenian community of Lebanon, creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed his election.

Religious conflict was part of a greater conflict that raged between the two &quot;camps&quot; of the Armenian diaspora. The ARF still resented the fact that they were ousted from Armenia after the Red Army took control, and the ARF leaders supported the creation of a &quot;Free, Independent, and United Armenia&quot;, free from both Soviet and Turkish hegemony. The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and Ramgavar Party, the main rivals of the ARF, supported the newly established Soviet rule in Armenia.

===Lebanon===
From 1923 to 1958, conflicts erupted among Armenian political parties struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. The ARF and Hunchakian parties struggled in 1926 for control of the newly established shanty-town of Bourj Hammoud in Lebanon; ARF member Vahan Vartabedian was assassinated. The assassination of Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi followed in 1929 and 1931 respectively. In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon. As a result, in the context of the Lebanese civil strife of 1958, an armed conflict erupted between supporters (the ARF) and opponents (Hunchakians, Ramgavars) of Zareh.

Prior to the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–90, the party was closely allied to the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and generally ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut constituencies with large Armenian populations. The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to play an active role in the civil war, however, soured relations between the two parties, and the Lebanese Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel&#x27;s son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.

Ethnic Armenians are allocated six seats in Lebanon&#x27;s 128-member National Assembly. The Lebanese branch of the ARF has usually controlled a majority of the Armenian vote and won most of the ethnic Armenian seats in the National Assembly. A major change occurred in the parliamentary election of 2000. With a rift between ARF and the Mustaqbal (Future) party of Rafik Hariri and the ARF was left with only one parliamentary seat, its worst result in many decades. The ARF called for a boycott of the 2005 Beirut elections. Relations soured further when on 5 August 2007 by-election in the Metn district, which includes the predominantly Armenian area of Bourj Hammoud, ARF decided to support Camille Khoury, the candidate backed by opposition leader Michel Aoun&#x27;s Free Patriotic Movement against Phalangist leader Amine Gemayel and subsequently won the seat. In the 2009 Lebanese general elections, the ARF won 2 seats in parliament which it holds presently. In June 2011, a new Lebanese government was formed where ARF party members were appointed to two ministerial positions, including Ministry of Industry, as part of the March 8 alliance.

The ARF Lebanon branch is headquartered in Bourj Hammoud in the Shaghzoian Centre, along with the ARF Lebanon Central Committee&#x27;s &quot;Aztag Daily&quot; newspaper and &quot;Voice Of Van&quot; 24-hour radio station.

Since February 2025, the ARF controls one portfolio in the Lebanese government of Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the Sports Ministry, headed by Nora Bayrakdarian.

=== Syria ===
During the French Mandate and under the parliamentary régime in Syria, there were reserved seats for the various religious communities, like in Lebanon, including for Armenians. This system is unofficially still living. Even when they didn&#x27;t take part as such in elections, Armenian parties such as Dashnak exerted an influence on them.

== Independent Armenia ==
The ARF has always maintained its ideological commitment to &quot;a Free, Independent, and United Armenia&quot;. The term &quot;United Armenia&quot; refers to the borders of Armenia recognized by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and outlined in the Treaty of Sèvres. After Armenia fell under Soviet control in 1920, the ARF within the Armenian diaspora opposed Soviet rule over Armenia and rallied in support of Armenian independence. It contributed to organizing a social and cultural framework aimed at preserving the Armenian identity. However, because of tight communist control, the ARF could not operate in the Armenian SSR and the political party remained banned until 1991.

In the leadup to the reestablishment of independent Armenia, the ARF was opposed to Armenia&#x27;s immediate independence from the Soviet Union, considering the threat of neighboring Turkey to be too great.

When independence was achieved in 1991, the ARF soon became one of the major and most active political parties, rivaled mainly by the Pan-Armenian National Movement. Subsequently, on 28 December 1994, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in a famous television speech banned the ARF, which was the nation&#x27;s leading opposition party, along with &quot;Yerkir&quot;, the country&#x27;s largest daily newspaper. The party&#x27;s leader, Hrayr Maroukhian, was expelled from Armenia. Ter-Petrosyan introduced evidence that supposedly detailed a plot hatched by the ARF to engage in terrorism against his administration, endanger Armenia&#x27;s national security and overthrow the government. Throughout the evening, government security forces arrested leading ARF figures, and police seized computers, fax machines, files and printing equipment from ARF offices. In addition to &quot;Yerkir&quot;, government forces also closed several literary, women&#x27;s, cultural, and youth publications. A group of eleven ARF members were arrested and accused of being members of a purported secret terrorist cell within the ARF known as the &quot;Dro Group&quot; (named after the Dro Committee, the group that was allegedly behind the plot), which was allegedly led by ARF member Hrant Markarian. Another group of thirty-one ARF members, including ARF Bureau member Vahan Hovhannisyan, were also arrested and charged with attempting to stage an armed coup, among other crimes.

Gerard Libaridian, an historian and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented the evidence against the defendants. He later stated in an interview that he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. The trials were marked by accusations of misconduct, including forced confessions, and were regarded as politically motivated by the opposition and human rights groups. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. Three men from the &quot;Dro Group&quot; case (Arsen Artsruni, Armenak Mnjoyan, Armen Grigoryan) and one man from the group of 31 (Tigran Avetisyan) were sentenced to death for murder. Their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 2003. Mnjoyan died while in prison in early 2019, while Artsruni and Avetisyan continue to serve their sentences.

The ban on the party was lifted less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks. Most of the ARF members convicted in relation to the &quot;Dro Group&quot; and &quot;Group of 31&quot; cases were released after the relegalization of the party.

In 2007, the ARF was not part of but had a cooperation agreement in place with the governing coalition, which consisted of two parties in the government coalition, the Republican Party and Prosperous Armenia Party. The Country of Law party was also a member of the governing coalition until it pulled out in May 2006. With 16 of the 131 seats in the National Assembly of Armenia, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation became the third-largest party in parliament.

In addition to its parliamentary seats, the following governmental ministries were also headed by ARF members: Ministry of Agriculture, Davit Lokian; Ministry of Education and Science, Levon Mkrtchian; Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Aghvan Vardanian; Ministry of Healthcare, Norair Davidian. On 13 July 2007, the ARF History Museum was inaugurated in Yerevan, displaying the history of the party and of its notable members.

In 2007, the ARF announced that it would nominate its own candidate to run for president of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election. In an innovation on 24–25 November 2007, the ARF conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates, Vahan Hovhannisyan and Armen Rustamyan, they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard opinion poll was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling political coalition in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.

Due to the signature of the so-called Zurich Protocols the ARF left the coalition and became an opposition party once again in 2009, but relations with other factions in the Armenian opposition remained frosty. In 2012 parliamentary election the ARF won 5 seats losing 11 parliamentary seats from 2007.

ARF then reentered Sargsyan&#x27;s cabinet in February 2016, obtaining three ministerial posts: Ministry of Economy, Local Government and Education; also, as a result of what was defined as a &quot;long-term political cooperation&quot; agreement with the Republican Party, ARF also got to appoint the regional governors of Aragatsotn and Shirak Provinces.

After the 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes, the ARF helped the Ministry of Defense of Armenia in setting up a volunteer reserve battalion, made up mostly of party members. This unit, made up of experienced commanders and soldiers, some of them veterans from the Nagorno-Karabakh war, is one of the newest units of the Armenian military. It traces back its heritage from the Shushi independent battalion of the previous war and is called the &quot;ARF battalion&quot;.

Following the 2017 elections, the party won 7 seats in the National Assembly with 6,58% of the votes.

Following the start of the Armenian Velvet Revolution, the ARF broke its coalition with the Republican Party of Armenia and moved into opposition; later on, the party supported Nikol Pashinyan&#x27;s new cabinet. The 2018 election saw the collapse of the party. The ARF only scored 3,89% of the votes and won no seats. It was the first time since the independence of Armenia that ARF had no political representation in the National Assembly.

Since its loss in the 2018 election, the ARF has become the main extra parliamentary opposition party to the Pashinyan government.

The ARF also gained popularity by intensifying its social aid programs to those in need in Armenia, especially in the rural areas. The party has provided aid to locals during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, mainly thanks to various donation made by members of the Armenian diaspora.

During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, the ARF again formed volunteer battalions to fight in the war. After the conclusion of the war, the party formed a coalition with 16 other political parties (most notably the former ruling Republican Party and the parliamentary opposition party Prosperous Armenia) calling itself the &quot;Homeland Salvation Movement&quot;, calling on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to resign for the defeat of the Armenian side in the war. Along with the other parties in the coalition, the ARF supported former prime minister Vazgen Manukyan as their candidate for prime minister. The Homeland Salvation Movement attempted to force Pashinyan&#x27;s resignation through the organization of mass protests.

The ARF formed the Armenia Alliance electoral alliance with ex-president Robert Kocharyan and the Reborn Armenia party to participate in the 2021 snap parliamentary election. The alliance won 29 seats out of 107, 10 of which were taken by candidates put forward by the ARF.

Electoral record

In the 2000s, the party usually garnered some 10 to 15 percent of the vote in national elections. In a 2007 confidential telegram Anthony Godfrey, U.S. Embassy in Armenia &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;, wrote that the party &quot;has had a historically loyal following of 10 to 12 percent of the population, but probably has little chance to expand from that base.&quot; Following the 2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution, the party polled at 1–2%. The ARF, for the first time since 1999, did not win seats in parliament and effectively became an extra-parliamentary opposition party. However, the party gained 10 seats in parliament following the 2021 elections, as part of the Armenia Alliance coalition.

==Artsakh==

After the Soviet Union expanded into the South Caucasus, it established the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR in 1923. In the final years of the Soviet Union, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation established a branch in Nagorno-Karabakh. In January 1991, the Dashnaktsutiun won the parliamentary election and governed as the ruling party during the entirety of the Nagorno-Karabakh war. The Dashnaks actively supported the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh (or Artsakh as Armenians call it). It aided the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army by sending armed volunteers to the front lines and supplying the army with weapons, food, medicine and moral support. The party even had its own infantry battalion, subordinated to NKR army command, the &quot;Shushi independent battalion&quot;, which became one of the most efficient Armenian units during the war. After deciding not to run in the second parliamentary elections, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ran in the 1999 elections and won 9 of the 33 seats in the National Assembly of Nagorno Karabakh. At the June 2005 elections, the Dashnaktsutiun was part of an electoral alliance with Movement 88 that won 3 out of 33 seats. Following the March 2020 elections, the party won 3 seats in the National Assembly.

== Ideology and goals ==

The principal founders of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation were nationalist, socialists, and Marxist elements were omnipresent in the introductory section of the party&#x27;s first program written by Rosdom, entitled &quot;General Theory&quot;. The ARF first set down its ideological and political goals during the Hamidian regime. It denounced the Ottoman regime and the unbearable conditions of life for its Armenians and advocated changing the regime in power and securing more rights through revolution and armed struggle. The ARF had and still has socialism within its political philosophy. Its program expresses the entire, multifaceted make-up of the Armenian revolutionary movement, including its national-liberation, political, and social-economic aspects. Politically the ARF is aligned with Marxist socialism, being influenced by Marxist analysis of history, capitalism, and politics.

Despite subsequent modifications, the above-mentioned principles and tendencies continue to characterize the ideological world of the Dashnaktsutiun, and its approach toward issues has remained unchanged. In recent decades, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation reasserted itself ideologically and reformulated the section of its program called &quot;General Theory&quot;, adapting it to current concepts of socialism, democracy and rights of self-determination. The party has long supported a parliamentary republican political system and campaigned for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the 2015 constitutional referendum.

Its primary goals are:
*Creation of a free, independent, and united Armenia. The borders of United Armenia shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the Treaty of Sèvres as well as the regions of Artsakh, Javakhk, and Nakhichevan (&quot;See map&quot;).
*International condemnation of the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenians, return of the lands which are occupied, and just reparations to the Armenian nation
*The gathering of worldwide expatriate Armenians on the lands of United Armenia.
*Strengthening Armenia&#x27;s statehood, institutionalization of democracy and the rule of law, securing the people&#x27;s economic well-being, and establishment of social justice, and a democratic and socialistic independent republic in Armenia

In 1907, the Dashnaktsutiun joined the Second International until its dissolution during World War I. It later joined the reformed Socialist International and remained a full member until 1960, when it decided to pull out of the organization. In 1996, it was re-accepted as an observer member, and in 1999 the Dashnaks earned full membership in the international organization. The party was also a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.

A member of the ARF is called &quot;Dashnaktsakan&quot; (in Eastern Armenian) or &quot;Tashnagtsagan&quot; (in Western Armenian), or Dashnak/Tashnag for short. Other than calling each other by name, members formally address one another as &quot;Comrade&quot; (Ընկեր or &quot;Unger&quot; for boys and men, Ընկերուհի or &quot;Ungerouhi&quot; for girls and women).

The party has supported some pro-European policies which favor the European integration of Armenia. The party was in favor of Armenia&#x27;s continued political association and economic integration with the European Union. However, in 2013 the ARF backed the government&#x27;s decision to join the Eurasian Economic Union instead of signing an Association Agreement and DCTFA with the EU, stating that there were &quot;security concerns&quot; facing Armenia. In 2016, the ARF signed a memorandum of co-operation with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D). Former S&amp;D President Gianni Pittella stated, &quot;Armenia deserves to benefit from both its membership of the Eurasian Economic Union and the closest relations with the European Union. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation has its place within the European social-democratic family.&quot;

== Affiliate organizations ==
The ARF is considered the foremost organization in the Armenian diaspora, having established numerous Armenian schools, community centers, Scouting and athletic groups, relief societies, youth groups, camps, and other organs throughout the world.

The ARF also works as an umbrella organ for the Armenian Relief Society, the Homenetmen Armenian General Athletic Union, the Hamazkayin Cultural Foundation, and many other community organizations. It operates the Armenian Youth Federation, which encourages the youth of the diaspora to join the political cause of the ARF and the Armenian people.

The ARF Shant Student Association and the ARF Armen Karo Student Association are organizations of college and university students on various campuses and are the only ARF organizations whose membership is exclusively from this group.

The Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG) was the militant arm of the ARF. It was active in from 1975 to 1987. They were responsible for a number of assassinations of Turkish diplomats with the goal of bringing attention to the Armenian genocide.

=== US and Canada ===
Armenian National Committee of America, an ARF-affiliated organization, is the strongest Armenian lobby organization in the United States. Its sister organization, the Armenian National Committee of Canada, operates in Canada as the strongest and most influential Armenian Canadian organization.

==== Western US Committee controversy ====
In December 2020, the ARF&#x27;s highest body, the Bureau, appointed a new Central Committee in the Western United States, citing the limitations created by the COVID-19 pandemic as reason for the appointment without the calling of a convention. After this, a group of ARF members refused to accept the decision, convened an assembly and elected a body which claimed to be the legitimate Central Committee of the ARF in the Western United States. This group took control of the bank account and various movable and immovable properties of the ARF Western Region of the US, including the official organ &quot;Asbarez&quot;. The members of this group were expelled from the party by decision of the Bureau in March 2021. The expelled group then initiated lawsuits, including Federal RICO litigation. On July 18, 2021, at the ARF Western United States 55th Regional Convention, sanctioned and attended by the ARF Bureau, a new Central Committee of the ARF Western United States Region was elected for a two-year term. On March 8, 2022, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation&#x27;s World Congress, its highest authority, issued a public statement re-affirming that &quot;the only ARF entity operating in the Western United States region is the ARF Central Committee elected for a term of two years on July 18, 2021 at the ARF Western United States 55th Regional Convention. This entity is the only one authorized to incorporate the use of the ARF&#x27;s name and use its flag, insignia and anthem.&quot; The newspaper &quot;Oragark&quot; was established as the new official publication of the organization in the Western United States in April 2022.

=== Other countries ===
Branches of the Armenian National Committee in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, England, France, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Russia, Switzerland, Syria, the Netherlands and Uruguay subsequently have played a significant role in the campaign for the recognition of the Armenian genocide in their respective countries.

== Media ==
ARF and its affiliate organizations worldwide publish 12 newspapers: 4 daily and 8 weeklies. Also, there are two TV channels, including one online. Two radio stations are aired every day, including one online.

<text>Roger Clive Davis (born 15 January 1946) is a Welsh former county cricketer who played for Glamorgan for 13 years as an all-rounder. While having a quiet career from his debut in 1964 until 1970, he then enjoyed five years of greater success, including scoring over 1,000 runs in the 1975 season, before a rapid decline in 1976 which saw him dropped from the team. He nevertheless enjoyed a successful career, with over 7,000 runs and 241 wickets in first-class cricket. He became headline news in 1971, when a ball hit him on the side of the head while he was fielding in the dangerous &quot;short leg&quot; position, causing his heart and breathing to stop.

==County career==

===Early years===

Born in Cardiff, Wales, Davis attended Blundell&#x27;s School. His older brother, John Davis, who was born in 1939, also went to school there. Both enjoyed successful sports careers in the school&#x27;s cricket 1st XI. John Davis debut for Glamorgan in 1959 having graduated from the University of Oxford and played in 13 matches before retiring to teaching in 1967. Roger Davis, in contrast, did not debut until five years after his older brother.

===Debut for Glamorgan===
Davis first played for Glamorgan in 1964 as an all-rounder in first-class matches. Batting in the middle of the order and bowling off-spin, he was to move up the order later in his career, he took 241 first-class wickets and hit five centuries. In his first year, he only played one match, scoring three runs, and taking one wicket. In 1967, he played his first List-A match for his county. He was not chosen for the 1965 season, but returned in 1966 for 12 matches, hit 273 runs at 13.00 with one half-century, and taking six wickets at 28.50. The following season was his most successful so far, taking 16 wickets at 22.37 and scoring 373 runs at 12.43 over 19 matches. He also played his first one-day match for the club, scoring five runs, and faced the International Cavaliers on 5 June 1966, scoring 43 before being caught and bowled by Jim Standen.

===Gary Sobers and the championship===
In 1968, he came close to preventing the record-breaking 36 runs in one over, scored by Gary Sobers in a match at Swansea, when he caught the ball but fell over the boundary rope, giving Sobers another six. During that season, he scored 877 runs off 22 matches at 21.92, with four fifties, but only took two wickets at 50.50. In one day cricket, he again played only one match, scoring six runs.

In 1969, he helped Glamorgan to their county championship victory, taking 33 catches, often in dangerous positions close to the batsman. He scored 835 first-class runs at 22.56 including his maiden century, 116. He also took 32 wickets at 23.43, including his first five-wicket haul. He again failed in one day matches, however, playing 15 but scoring only 45 runs at 3.21. He did, however, take 11 wickets at 16.18. Over the winter of 1969/1970 Davis toured the West Indies, however he found playing difficult there during the two first-class matches. He scored 47 runs at 11.75, and took only two wickets at 62.50.

===Peak===
The early 1970s, in contrast to his first six years at Glamorgan, were to be the peak of Davis&#x27;s cricketing career. In 1970, Davis enjoyed a successful season. Out of 27 first-class matches he scored 82 runs at 20.07, hitting four half centuries of the third time in his career. In one day matches his batting was of a lower standard, however, hitting 101 runs at 9.18 over 14 games. Despite this mixed batting performance, his bowling was at its peak. In first-class cricket, Davis took a career best 54 wickets in the season at 25.42, including career best figures of 6/82 and one five-wicket haul. This was supported by one day efforts resulting in five wickets at 25.20.

The 1971 season saw both great success and great difficulty for Davis. There was little difference in his one-day bowling, with six wickets at 24.83, and his first-class bowling was greatly reduces, 12 wickets at 35.83. His one-day batting was also fairly average, hitting only 57 runs at 11.40. It was his first-class batting that excelled during the season. Davis hit 528 runs at 25.14, a career best average at that point, and scored his highest first-class total, 134.

In contrast to this success, the most difficult time of his career began in May 1971 during a match against Warwickshire at Cardiff. Davis was struck on the head by a cricket ball, while fielding close to the batsman at short leg. Cricket players wore little protective equipment at the time, and David began to suffer convulsions before being given CPR by a doctor from the crowd. He was then rushed to hospital, where it transpired that both his heart and his breathing had stopped when he was hit. After making a full recovery, Davis continued to play for Glamorgan. Later that year, he also played for the England Under-25s.

He followed his career best 134 in the 1971 season with 114 in 1972, ending the season with 617 first-class runs at 22.85, and two half centuries to go with his hundred. He also found some success in his one-day batting, reaching his highest score thus far, 46*, and hit a career best 219 at 16.84. He also enjoyed his second best first-class bowling performance after the 1970 season, this time taking 41 first-class wickets at 37.63, and his best one day bowling figures, 15 wickets at 24.86 with his lowest economy figure, 3.74 runs an over.

Success continued in 1973. Davis took 10 one day wickets at 33.80, and 24 first-class wickets at 29.87. His one-day batting reached its peak, when he hit a career best 101 against the touring West Indies. He finished the season with 291 runs at 29.10, including his one and only one day century. These figures were paired with his 721 runs at 20.60 in first-class cricket, with three half centuries.

In 1974, Davis hit 752 runs at 24.25 and took 22 wickets at 43.45 in first-class cricket. His one-day success continued, with another career best 301 at 17.70, including hit first half centuries. His nine wickets at 44.55 in one day cricket, however, were his worst in terms of average. Good form continued, nevertheless. In 1975, Davis enjoyed his greatest season, hitting 1,243 runs in first-class cricket. These runs came at an average of 31.07, the only time he would reach an average of over 30, and including two centuries, the most of any of his season, and a high score of 131. His one-day batting also reached new heights, with a career best 555 at 27.75 and four fifties. It was only the second season that Davis had scored over 50 in the one day form. With the ball, Davis took 29 first-class wickets at 37.75, with two five-wicket hauls, another careed best statistic. In one day matches, he took 11 wickets at 27.72.

===Decline===
From 1971 until 1975, Davis had hit 3,861 first-class runs at 24.89, hit four centuries and 17 half-centuries, and taken 182 wickets. His success came to an abrupt end, however, with his form deteriorating rapidly in 1976. While he enjoyed a good average in one day bowling, four wickets at 17.17, three of those came in one match, and he failed to take a first-class wicket for the first time in his career. With the bat, he scored 275 runs at 21.15, with two half centuries compared to the six of the two previous seasons. In one day matches, he scored 150 runs at 18.75, compared to the 555 of the previous season. Glamorgan quickly refused him a contract for the following year, prompting his resignation.

He did, however, return to play for an old Glamorgan team in 1989. On 17 May 1989 old Glamorgan players formed &quot;Glamorgan 1969&quot; to face the current team, &quot;Glamorgan 1989&quot;, in a 30-over day/night match. Davis took three wickets for 44 runs off of four overs, those of Michael Cann, John Derrick and the century maker Matthew Maynard. Davis then opened the batting for &quot;Glamorgan 1969&quot; with Alan Jones, scoring three before being bowled by Steve Watkin.

<text>The Justice Party (Armenian: Արդարություն, &quot;Ardarutyun&quot;), also known as the Justice Alliance was an electoral coalition, consisting of nine different political parties in Armenia.

==History==
The electoral alliance was created by Stepan Demirchyan, leader of the People&#x27;s Party of Armenia in 2003.

Prior to the 2003 Armenian parliamentary election, the Justice coalition listed 136
candidates to run in the election across Armenia. Some candidates from other minor parties were also included in the list, to which they were affiliated with the coalition, but not formally part of it. Following the 2003 election, the Justice coalition won 13.6% of the popular vote and 14 out of 131 seats. It became the second largest group within the National Assembly and had won the second largest percentage of the popular vote.

The People&#x27;s Party of Armenia often regarded itself as the lead party within the coalition, however, other member parties disputed this.

The coalition dissolved prior to the 2007 Armenian parliamentary elections due to internal divisions among members. Some of the members chose to run independently in the 2007 elections.

==Ideology==
Since the coalition consisted of several political parties, each party supported various ideologies. During an interview, Stepan Demirchyan stated, &quot;We should strive for good neighborly relations with our neighbors, we are in favor of European integration, we attach importance to relations with Russia and the United States. I do not see any contradiction here. Armenia must pursue a balanced foreign policy.&quot;

<doc id="408276" wikidata="Q4314930" url="?curid=408276" title="National Unity (Armenia)">
<text>National Unity () is a conservative political party in Armenia. It was founded and led by Artashes Geghamyan from 1997 until his death in 2024.

==History==
In the parliamentary election held on 25 May 2003, the party won 8.8% of the popular vote and 9 out of 131 seats in the National Assembly of Armenia. In the 2003 presidential election, Geghamyan received 17.54% of the vote in the first round, but was eliminated prior to the second round of voting. In the 2007 parliamentary election, the party did not win any seats, receiving a popular vote of 3.69%. The party has not participated in any parliamentary elections since 2007.

In the February 2008 presidential election, Geghamyan, running again as the National Unity Party&#x27;s candidate, placed seventh with 0.46% of the vote according to final official results.

Following the 2020–2021 Armenian protests, the party endorsed the &quot;New Union&quot; political alliance of the Voice of the Nation Party, the Towards Russia Party, and the Constitutional Rights Union. Geghamyan attended a meeting of the alliance. Geghamyan has also been very critical of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, accusing the Prime Minister of being ruled by George Soros and Western interests.

==Ideology==
The party advocates for strengthening the Armenian economy, protecting minority rights, deepening European integration while maintaining close relations with other Commonwealth of Independent States members, especially with Russia. The party also believes in keeping Armenia within the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Eurasian Union but also fostering deeper relations with the United States and NATO. However, the party is against any NATO peacekeepers being deployed in Armenia.

The party additionally believes in establishing peace with Armenia&#x27;s neighbours and peacefully resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

In May 2021, the party supported the idea of Armenia joining the Belarus-Russia Union State.

<text>Orinats Yerkir (, ՕԵԿ/OEK) is a political party operating in Armenia. Its foundation was in 1998, and founder Artur Baghdasaryan continues to lead the party. The party was formerly known as Armenian Renaissance (), during the run-up to the 2017 parliamentary elections.

The party&#x27;s name is translated into English in a number of ways, including Country of Law and Rule of Law.

==Party history==
The party participated in elections for the first time during the 1999 Armenian parliamentary election, winning a total of 6 seats in the National Assembly.

Following the 2003 elections, the party won 19 seats. Also in 2003, Gagik Aslanyan, the Chairman of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party, opted to merge his party with Orinats Yerkir.

Following the 2007 Armenian parliamentary elections, the party obtained 9 seats in the National Assembly.

In the February 2008 presidential election, Baghdasaryan was the party&#x27;s candidate; he obtained third place, according to the final official results, with 17.7% of the vote.

The party participated in the 2009 Yerevan City Council election, winning 5.11% of votes, but failing to gain seats in the Yerevan City Council.

After the 2012 Armenian parliamentary election, the party won 6 seats in the National Assembly.

The party participated in the 2013 Yerevan City Council election, winning just 3.73% of votes, gaining no seats in the Yerevan City Council.

In 2014, during an interview, Petros Makeyan, the leader of the Democratic Homeland Party, proclaimed that Serzh Sargsyan, the leader of the Republican Party of Armenia, had been indirectly controlling the Orinats Yerkir party for years.

In 2017, the party was renamed &quot;Armenian Renaissance&quot; after the creation of a political alliance with the Unified Armenians Party, led by Ruben Avagyan. Following the 2017 Armenian parliamentary election, the alliance lost all political representation in the National Assembly, receiving just 3.72% of the popular vote. The alliance dissolved and Orinats Yerkir then decided to restore its original name during a meeting held on 13 February 2018.

The party participated in the 2018 Yerevan City Council election, winning just 1.09% of the popular vote, gaining no seats in the Yerevan City Council.

The party initially refused to participate in the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election because the National Assembly failed to pass amendments to electoral law, yet days later decided to register with the country&#x27;s CEC in order to participate in the elections. It received just 0.99% of the popular vote. As this was lower than the 5% minimum threshold required, the party failed to gain any representation in the National Assembly.

During the 2020–2021 Armenian protests, Orinats Yerkir announced its support to the Homeland Salvation Movement political alliance, however, the alliance did not accept their request to join as a full member.

The party did not participate in the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election. The party currently acts as an extra-parliamentary force.

==Ideology==
During an interview in 2007, party leader, Artur Baghdasaryan stated that, &quot;Armenia&#x27;s membership in the European Union should be one of the key priorities of our country&#x27;s present and future foreign policy, as EU membership will open new avenues for Armenia.&quot; Baghdasaryan further stated that in order to begin accession negotiations with the EU, Armenia would have to strengthen its democracy and complete legal, social, economic and political reforms in order to meet European standards, just as the Baltic states have done.

The party is mostly pro-Western but also supports maintaining positive relations with Russia. The party additionally supports the goals and initiatives of the EU&#x27;s Eastern Partnership program. 

In 2018, the party announced that it supports Armenia&#x27;s continued membership in the CSTO and the Eurasian Economic Union.

<doc id="408283" wikidata="Q1751089" url="?curid=408283" title="Azerbaijani Popular Front Party">
<text>The Azerbaijani Popular Front Party (APFP; , ) is a political party in Azerbaijan, founded in 1989 by Abulfaz Elchibey. Since Elchibey was ousted from power in the 1993 military coup, the party has been one of the main opposition parties to the Heydar Aliyev and Ilham Aliyev authoritarian regimes.

The party formed in 1989 as an anti-Soviet political movement. The party pushed for Azerbaijani independence from the Soviet Union. The party staged mass protests against the Soviet regime. After Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union, Popular Front pressured the communist old guard that controlled newly independent Azerbaijan to establish a parliament and allow free elections. The party pressured Ayaz Mutallibov, Azerbaijan&#x27;s first president to implement democratic reforms and forced him out of power in 1992 when he tried to cancel the 1992 presidential election in a self-coup. Popular Front leader Abulfaz Elchibey was elected in the 1992 election.

The party&#x27;s policies emphasized democracy, rule of law, and secularism, as well as respect for human rights, religious rights and ethnic minorities.

In the aftermath of the 1993 coup where Elchibey was ousted from power, the party has been blocked from participating in several elections, and prominent individuals associated with the party have been repressed by Azerbaijan governments ruled by Heydar Aliyev and his son Ilham Aliyev. The party has also boycotted several elections, citing an unbalanced playing field and repression by the incumbent government.

== History ==

===Popular Front of Azerbaijan===
The founding congress of the party was held in July 1989.

PFA came to unite several informal public organizations which were established in the 1980s to struggle for the independence of Azerbaijan from the Soviet Union. In 1987, Ali Karimli, a law school student, became the founder and leader of one of these informal organizations - &quot;Yurd&quot; (&quot;Homeland&quot;) - that inspired and led thousands of students to the main square of Baku city to protest against the Soviet Union. As a result, a large-scale campaign of public demonstrations and meetings swept across Azerbaijan. Later, the movement was suppressed by the special forces of the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR. Despite this fact, the Popular Front of Azerbaijan was established and Yurd became an integral part of this movement.

Intellectuals associated with the party questioned the official Soviet narrative of the Soviet takeover of Azerbaijan in 1920. 

In 1992, Abulfaz Elchibey, the leader of PFA, won the 1992 Azerbaijani presidential election. A period of political, social, and economic reforms followed. The laws on political parties, freedom of press, education, and others were adopted. The country chose a pro-western, liberal economic course and established the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat.

In April 1993, the Russian (formerly Soviet) army was withdrawn from Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan became the first republic in the former USSR, which achieved a full and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops.

General Heydar Aliyev captured power in 1993 following the 1993 Azerbaijani coup d&#x27;état and the Subsequent vote of confidence referendum on Abulfaz Elchibey&#x27;s presidency. Elchibey was forced to leave the capital city.

=== Transformation to political party ===

After Elchibey&#x27;s death in 2000, the party split into two wings, the &quot;reform&quot; wing led by Ali Kerimli and the &quot;classical&quot; wing led by Mirmahmud Miralioglu.

Considering the dramatic and challenging situation facing PFA following the coup, Ali Karimli took the initiative by leading and protecting the organization from the attacks of the new regime from 1993 until 1997 and restoring its political power. In 1995, with the proposal of Ali Karimli and as a result of internal party discussions, the Popular Front of Azerbaijan was reorganized from a social-political movement into a political party. In the same year, the Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan (PFPA) managed to take seats in Parliament, and Ali Kerimli became a leader of the parliamentary party fraction.

In 2000, after the death of PFPA Chairman Elchibey, Ali Karimli was elected Chairman of the Party. In the 2000 parliament elections, PFPA retook seats, and Ali Karimli was elected the leader of the opposition faction in parliament.

The 2003 Azerbaijani presidential election in Azerbaijan fell short of international norms and standards. They were followed by another wave of repressions against the opposition. Consequently, PFPA first suggested and then proclaimed the unification of opposition as the surest means to free and fair elections. On 18 March 2005 Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan (PFPA) signed an agreement with other opposition parties to establish a united opposition bloc – &quot;Freedom&quot; - for participation in the parliamentary elections in November 2005.

<text>Nanci Caroline Griffith (July 6, 1953 – August 13, 2021) was an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. She often appeared on the PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, starting in 1985 during Season 10. In 1990, Griffith appeared on the Channel 4 programme &quot;Town &amp; Country with John Prine&quot; in a segment entitled &quot;White Pants&quot;, where she wore white pants at the Bluebird Café in Nashville, Tennessee, along with Buddy Mondlock, Barry &quot;Byrd&quot; Burton, and Robert Earl Keen. In 1994, Griffith won a Grammy Award for the album &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms.&quot;

Griffith toured with various other artists including Buddy Holly&#x27;s band, the Crickets; John Prine, Iris DeMent, Suzy Bogguss, Judy Collins, and The Everly Brothers. Griffith recorded duets with many artists, among them Prine, Emmylou Harris, Mary Black, Don McLean, Jimmy Buffett, Dolores Keane, Willie Nelson, Adam Duritz (of Counting Crows), the Chieftains, John Stewart, and Darius Rucker. Griffith referred to her backing band as the Blue Moon Orchestra.

==Early life and career==
Griffith, the youngest of three siblings, was born in Seguin, Texas and grew up in Austin, where her family moved shortly after her birth. Her mother Ruelene was a real estate agent and amateur actress; her father, Marlin Griffith, was a graphic artist and barbershop quartet singer. Griffith began her music career at age 12, singing in a local coffeehouse. When she was a teenager her father took her to see Townes Van Zandt. At 14, she performed her first professional gig at the Red Lion Cabaret in downtown Austin. Her debut album, &quot;There’s a Light Beyond These Woods&quot;, was released in 1978; the cover was designed by her father.

Griffith&#x27;s career spanned a variety of musical genres, predominantly country, folk, and what she termed &quot;folkabilly.&quot; She won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1994 for her 1993 recording, &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms.&quot; The album features Griffith covering the songs of artists who were her major influences. One of her better-known songs is &quot;From a Distance,&quot; which was written and composed by Julie Gold. Similarly, other artists have occasionally achieved greater success than Griffith herself with songs that she wrote or co-wrote. For example, Kathy Mattea had a country music top five hit with a 1986 cover of Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Love at the Five and Dime&quot; and Suzy Bogguss had one of her largest hits with Griffith (and Tom Russell)&#x27;s &quot;Outbound Plane&quot;.

In 1994, Griffith teamed with Jimmy Webb to contribute the song &quot;If These Old Walls Could Speak&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. She survived breast cancer which was diagnosed in 1996, and thyroid cancer in 1998.

Christine Lavin, a singer and songwriter, remembers the first time she saw Griffith perform:I was struck by how perfect everything was about her singing, her playing, her talking. I realized from the get-go that this was someone who was a complete professional. Obviously she had worked a long time to get to be that good.

Griffith contributed background vocals on many other recordings.
Griffith performed four songs, The Day the Earth Stopped Cold, Gravity of the Situation, So Strange, and Hold My Hand with Hootie &amp; the Blowfish during their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance in 1996 in Columbia, South Carolina to raise awareness for Sweet Relief Musicians Fund.

Griffith suffered from severe writer&#x27;s block after 2004, lasting until the 2009 release of her &quot;The Loving Kind&quot; album, which contained nine selections that she had written and composed either entirely by herself or as collaborations. After several months of limited touring in 2011, Griffith&#x27;s bandmates the Kennedys (Pete &amp; Maura Kennedy) packed up their professional Manhattan recording studio and moved it to Nashville installing it in Griffith&#x27;s home. There with her backing group including the Kennedys and Pat McInerney, she co-produced her album &quot;Intersection&quot; over the summer. The album included several new original songs and was released in April 2012 on Proper Records.

==Awards==
Griffith won the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album for &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms.&quot; She was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 1995. Griffith was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 1995. In 2008, the Americana Music Association awarded her its Lifetime Americana Trailblazer Award. Lyle Lovett, who contributed backing vocals to her third album, &quot;Once in a Very Blue Moon&quot;, had won it before her. In 2010, Griffith received a Lifetime Achievement Award at BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

Griffith was posthumously inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame in February 2022 at the Paramount Theatre in Austin.

== The Blue Moon Orchestra ==
Griffith called her backing band the Blue Moon Orchestra. With regard to the chosen stage name, she wrote:

The title selection of the &quot;Once in a Very Blue Moon&quot; album reached number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart in 1986. In 1986, Griffith showcased tracks from her &quot;Lone Star State of Mind&quot; album on The Nashville Network TV show, &quot;New Country&quot;.

<text>Douglass Cecil North (November 5, 1920 – November 23, 2015) was an American economist known for his work in economic history. Along with Robert Fogel, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1993. In the words of the Nobel Committee, North and Fogel &quot;renewed research in economic history by applying economic theory and quantitative methods in order to explain economic and institutional change.&quot;

North was an influential figure in New Institutional Economics, which emphasizes the impact of institutions on economic behaviors and outcomes. North argued, &quot;Institutions provide the incentive structure of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth, stagnation, or decline.&quot; Rational and wealth-maximizing individuals lack complete information and have difficulties monitoring and enforcing agreements. Institutions can provide information and reduce transaction costs, thus encouraging economic activity.

==Biography==
Douglass North was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 5, 1920. He moved several times as a child due to his father&#x27;s work at MetLife. The family lived in Ottawa, Ontario, in Lausanne, Switzerland, in New York City, and in Wallingford, Connecticut.

North was educated at Ashbury College in Ottawa and the Choate School in Wallingford. He was accepted at Harvard at the same time that his father became the head of MetLife on the West Coast, so North chose instead to attend the University of California, Berkeley. During his time at Berkeley, North was a member of Chi Phi fraternity. In 1942, he graduated with a general B.A. in the humanities. Although his grades amounted to slightly better than a &quot;C&quot; average, he managed to complete a triple major in political science, philosophy and economics. That same year, he entered the US Merchant Marine Academy, graduated a year later and went to sea for three years as a deck officer.

A conscientious objector in World War II, North became a navigator in the Merchant Marine, traveling between San Francisco and Australia. During that time, he read economics and picked up his hobby of photography. He taught navigation at the Maritime Service Officers&#x27; School in Alameda during the last year of the war, and struggled with the decision of whether to become a photographer or an economist.

North returned to UC Berkeley, where he obtained a Ph.D. degree in economics in 1952. He subsequently began his career as an assistant professor at the University of Washington.

North died on November 23, 2015, at his summer home in Benzonia, Michigan from esophageal cancer at the age of 95.

==Academic career==

From 1951 to 1983, North taught economics at the University of Washington, where he was an assistant professor till 1956, an associate professor from 1956 to 1960, and a full professor till 1983; he also chaired the economics department at Washington from 1967 to 1979. In 1960, North became co-editor of the &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot;, where he helped popularise cliometrics. In 1979 he served as the Peterkin Professor of Political Economy at Rice University, and in 1981–82 as the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions at Cambridge University, before joining the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis in 1983 as the Henry R. Luce Professor of Law and Liberty in the Department of Economics (where he also directed the Center for Political Economy from 1984 to 1990). He also served as the Bartlett Burnap Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

In 1991, he became the first economic historian to win the John R. Commons Award, which was established by the International Honors Society for Economics in 1965.

A collection of North&#x27;s papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.

==Research agenda==
Along with Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson, he helped found the International Society for the New Institutional Economics (ISNIE) which held its first meeting in St. Louis in 1997. His research included property rights, transaction costs, the institutional basis of markets, and economic organization in history as well as economic development in developing countries.

North served as an expert for the Copenhagen Consensus and as an advisor to governments around the world. He was engaged in research (with John J. Wallis of the University of Maryland and Barry Weingast of Stanford University) on how countries emerge from what they call &quot;the natural state&quot; and into long-run economic growth. He was a trustee of Economists for Peace and Security, and a special adviser to the non-profit organization Vipani.

==Publications==
=== &quot;Institutions&quot; ===
In 1991 Douglass North published a paper, titled &quot;Institutions&quot;, in the &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot;. This paper summarized much of his earlier research relating to economic and institutional change. North defines institutions as &quot;humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interactions&quot;. Constraints, as North describes, are devised as formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights) and informal restraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, codes of conduct), which usually contribute to the perpetuation of order and safety within a market or society. The degree to which they are effective is subject to varying circumstances, such as a government&#x27;s limited coercive force, a lack of organized state, or the presence of strong religious precept.

Section 2 of North&#x27;s 1991 paper describes the economic development of societies as occurring in stages:

North begins with local exchange within the village. In this setting, specialization &quot;is rudimentary and self-sufficiency characterizes most individual households&quot;, with small-scale village trade existing within dense social networks of informal constraints that facilitate local exchange, and a relatively low transaction cost. However, this confined market reduces the potential of specialization and increases production costs. In this close-knit network &quot;people have an intimate understanding of each other, and the threat of violence is a continuous force for preserving order ...&quot;

With growth, the market extends beyond the village into larger, interconnected regions. As the participants of a transaction become more socially distant, the terms of exchange must be made more explicit. This increase in transaction costs necessitates institutions that reduce the risks of being cheated, either by raising &quot;the benefits of cooperative solutions or the costs of defection&quot;. With increased specialization, production costs are reduced and can justify higher transaction costs.

As long-distance trade becomes more feasible, generally through caravans or lengthy ship voyages, individuals and groups experience occupational and geographic specialization. Society also experiences a rise of formal trading centers (temporary gathering places, towns or cities). From the development of long-distance trade arise two transactional cost problems.

The first transactional cost problem is agency: the transfer of one&#x27;s goods or services outside the control of local rule leaves the rules of exchange undefined, the risk of unfair trade high, and the contracts within society unenforced. For this reason, sedentary merchants often would send their kin with the product to ensure its safe arrival and the fulfillment of agreed terms of exchange by the receiving party.

The second transactional cost problem is the enforcement of contracts. Historically this problem was met with either armed forces protecting ships or caravans, or use of tolls by local coercive groups. However, in modern societies, institutions acting cooperatively in the interest of free market trade provide protection for goods and enforcement of contracts. Negotiation and enforcement in alien parts of the world require the development of a standardized system of weights and measures.

As development continues, the rise of capital markets (and the protection of associated property rights), creates social capital and enables citizens to gain wealth. Technology plays an instrumental role in the continued development of manufacturing sectors, and acts to lower transaction costs in several ways. The most substantial benefits are generally the result of transportation improvements.

Eventually, society becomes overwhelmingly urban. This final stage of development specialization requires increasing percentages of the resources of the society to be active in the market so that the transaction sector becomes a large share of gross national product. Highly specialized forms of transaction organizations emerge at this stage. Globalized specialization and division of labor demand institutions to ensure property rights even when trading in neighboring countries enabling capital markets to develop &quot;with credible commitment on the part of the players.&quot;

North enumerates three primitive types of exchange:
* Tribal Society, which &quot;relies on a dense social network&quot;.(Colson 1974, p. 59)
* Bazaars, which have &quot;high measurement costs; continuous effort at clientization; intensive bargaining at every margin&quot;
* Long-distance caravan trade illustrates the informal constraints that made trade possible in a world where protection was essential and no organized state existed.
All three methods above are found to be much less likely to evolve than large urban societies.

North&#x27;s paper concludes with a few intriguing questions which his paper aimed to address:
* What is it about informal constraints that give them such a pervasive influence upon the long-run character of economies?
* What is the relationship between formal and informal constraints?
* How does an economy develop the informal constraints that make individuals constrain their behavior so that they make political and judicial systems effective forces for third party enforcement?

=== &quot;Transaction Costs, Institutions, and Economic Performance&quot; ===
In a 1992 paper, North argues that neoclassical economic theory overlooks the institutions required to create efficient markets with low monitoring and transaction costs. He develops a framework for explaining how institutions change and become more efficient over time.

North theorizes that all transaction costs are rooted in information asymmetries between the parties to an exchange. Hence, each person must expend resources ascertaining the qualities of the good she is buying and enforcing the terms of the trade. Because these costs pose such a large barrier to economic growth, a central function of political and economic institutions is to control them, often by disincentivizing fraud, theft, and other socially detrimental behaviors. Yet those who command the political system will structure these institutions to maximize their personal benefit, rather than the social benefit, so transaction costs will not always be minimized by existing institutions.

Importantly for North, individuals and organizations make their decisions on the basis of imperfect ideologies, which are &quot;mental models&quot; for how the world functions. Therefore, the politicians who craft institutions will, despite their best efforts, occasionally fail to maximize their personal gain. When this happens, entrepreneurs who believe that institutional changes will significantly benefit them will enter the political realm to effect this change. The result is incremental institutional change, pushed forward by self-seeking individuals.

North argues that this change will usually be slow for two reasons. First, the powerful actors in control of the political systems made the institutions for their benefit and so will be reluctant to change them, resulting in path dependence. Second, informal institutions—like social customs and cultural practices—are by their nature slow to change, yet play a role in determining transaction costs.

North goes on to apply this framework to analyze a few historical examples, including the Green Revolution, the American Revolution, and imperial Spain, as well as to offer some general policy recommendations.

===&quot;Violence and the Rise of Open-Access Orders&quot;===
In &quot;Violence and the Rise of Open-Access Orders&quot;, North, Wallis, and Weingast integrate a theory of politics with a theory of economics to explain the institutions, i.e. the rules governing behavior, that develop in human societies. In their view, the primary task of any set of institutions is to limit violence among individuals. They focus on two sets of institutions—which they call social orders—that accomplish this task, but which also have different effects on economic growth.

The first set of institutions are called &quot;limited access orders,&quot; and they are characterized by elite control of the political and economic systems to extract rents. Violence is limited because the most powerful actors maintain law and order to protect their rents. However, their means of maintaining law and order require supporting economic and political monopolies, which stunt economic growth.

The second set of institutions that North et al. propose are called &quot;open access orders,&quot; and they limit violence through a politically controlled military. These societies allow anyone who meets some impersonal criteria to form political and economic organizations, resulting in a Schumpeterian process of &quot;creative destruction.&quot; The military limits societal violence, and the political actors that control this military are themselves constrained by the constant competition for political and economic power that this process of creative destruction entails. Unlike limited access orders, open access orders stimulate economic growth since solutions to economic and political challenges can come from any individual in society, rather than a select few.

North et al. argue that modern open access orders emerged from limited access orders through a two-step process: first, the application of impersonal laws to elites and the consolidation of military power, and second, the extension of elite privileges to the rest of society. They apply this theory to explain the legitimacy of elections within different societies and to explain why economic growth is more consistent in modern open access orders than it is in limited access orders.

==Personal life==

North was married twice. His first marriage was to Lois Heister in 1944 with whom he had three sons: Douglass Jr., Christopher and Malcolm. During the marriage, Heister became a notable activist and politician. The marriage ended in divorce. North remarried in 1972, to Elisabeth Case.

==Legacy==
As a Nobel laureate, North&#x27;s reputation extended both from his own university environment to the international influences made by his research and writing. North&#x27;s research in New Economic History has included such notable economists and historians as Jonathan Hughes, Richard Sutch, Lloyd Mercer, Jim Sheperd, Donald Gordon, Gary Walton, Lance E. Davis, Robert Huttenback, Roger Ransom, Gaston Rimlinger, Terry L. Anderson, P.J. Hill, Philip Coelho, and David Knowles as recorded in the 60th Anniversary dedication volume in memory of North.

<text>The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), operated by the United States federal government, is the world&#x27;s largest medical library.

Located in Bethesda, Maryland, the NLM is an institute within the National Institutes of Health. Its collections include more than seven million books, journals, technical reports, manuscripts, microfilms, photographs, and images on medicine and related sciences, including some of the world&#x27;s oldest and rarest works.

 the acting director of the NLM was Stephen Sherry.

== History ==
The precursor of the National Library of Medicine, established in 1836, was the Library of the Surgeon General&#x27;s Office, a part of the office of the Surgeon General of the United States Army. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and its Medical Museum were founded in 1862 as the Army Medical Museum. Throughout their history the Library of the Surgeon General&#x27;s Office and the Army Medical Museum often shared quarters. From 1866 to 1887, they were housed in Ford&#x27;s Theatre after production there was stopped, following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.

In 1956, the library collection was transferred from the control of the U.S. Department of Defense to the Public Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and renamed the National Library of Medicine, through the instrumentality of Frank Bradway Rogers, who was the director from 1956 to 1963. The library moved to its current quarters in Bethesda, Maryland, on the campus of the National Institutes of Health, in 1962.

==Publications and informational resources==
Since 1879, the National Library of Medicine has published the Index Medicus, a monthly guide to articles, in nearly five thousand selected journals. The last issue of Index Medicus was printed in December 2004, but this information is offered in the freely accessible PubMed, among the more than fifteen million MEDLINE journal article references and abstracts going back to the 1960s and 1.5 million references going back to the 1950s.

The National Library of Medicine runs the National Center for Biotechnology Information, which houses biological databases (PubMed among them) that are freely accessible on the Internet through the Entrez search engine and Lister Hill National Center For Biomedical Communications. As the United States National Release Center for SNOMED CT, NLM provides SNOMED CT data and resources to licensees of the NLM UMLS Metathesaurus. NLM maintains ClinicalTrials.gov registry for human interventional and observational studies. Additionally NLM runs ChemIDplus, which is a chemical database of over 400,000 chemicals complete with names, synonyms, and structures. It includes links to NLM and other databases and resources, including links to federal, state and international agencies.

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Program was established at the National Library of Medicine in 1967 and is charged with developing computer databases compiled from the medical literature and from the files of governmental and nongovernmental organizations. The program has implemented several information systems for chemical emergency response and public education, such as the Toxicology Data Network, TOXMAP, Tox Town, Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders, Toxmystery, and the Household Products Database. These resources are accessible without charge on the internet.

==Radiation exposure==
The United States National Library of Medicine Radiation Emergency Management System provides:
* Guidance for health care providers, primarily physicians, about clinical diagnosis and treatment of radiation injury during radiological and nuclear emergencies
* Just-in-time, evidence-based, usable information with sufficient background and context to make complex issues understandable to those without formal radiation medicine expertise
* Web-based information that may be downloaded in advance, so that it would be available during an emergency if the Internet were not accessible

Radiation Emergency Management System is produced by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Office of Planning and Emergency Operations, in cooperation with the National Library of Medicine, Division of Specialized Information Services, with subject matter experts from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many U.S. and international consultants.

==Extramural division==
The Extramural Division provides grants to support research in medical information science and to support planning and development of computer and communications systems in medical institutions. Research, publications, and exhibitions on the history of medicine and the life sciences also are supported by the History of Medicine Division. In April 2008 the current exhibition Against the Odds: Making a Difference in Global Health was launched.

== National Center for Biotechnology Information division ==
National Center for Biotechnology Information is an intramural division within National Library of Medicine that creates public databases in molecular biology, conducts research in computational biology, develops software tools for analyzing molecular and genomic data, and disseminates biomedical information, all for the better understanding of processes affecting human health and disease.

<text>The Anointed Quorum, also known as the Quorum of the Anointed, or the Holy Order, was a select body of men and women who Joseph Smith initiated into Mormon temple ordinances at Nauvoo, Illinois, which gave them special standing in the early Latter Day Saint movement. Beginning in May 1842, Smith gave this group, which ultimately numbered over sixty persons, their washings and anointings and endowments in the upper floor of his Red Brick Store on Water Street, as well as in a few private residences in the city. Most couples, but not all, also received their Second Anointing. Members typically referred to their meetings, which were held usually every two weeks, as prayer circles, because prayer played an important role in the group&#x27;s religious activities.

Nearly all members of the Anointed Quorum were important leaders and their wives in the church or community, including the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. After Smith&#x27;s death in June 1844, members of the Anointed Quorum continued to meet under the direction of Brigham Young, even admitting additional persons to the group. As the Nauvoo Temple neared completion during 1845, they prepared the building&#x27;s upper floor for the administration of ordinances. Between December 1845 and February 1846, the Anointed Quorum extended the same rituals they had received from Smith to over 5,000 men and women living in the vicinity of Nauvoo.

After the Mormons left Nauvoo in 1846, the Anointed Quorum ceased to exist as an organized group. The Anointed Quorum dealt essentially with spiritual and matters, but it was never an official administrative body of the church.

==Members==
The following individuals were members of the Anointed Quorum (spouses are listed together and plural marriage relationships are indicated):

<doc id="408292" wikidata="Q460475" url="?curid=408292" title="Nick Bostrom">
<text>Nick Bostrom ( ; ; born 10 March 1973) is a philosopher known for his work on existential risk, the anthropic principle, human enhancement ethics, whole brain emulation, superintelligence risks, and the reversal test. He was the founding director of the now dissolved Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford and is now Principal Researcher at the Macrostrategy Research Initiative.
Bostrom is the author of &quot;Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2014) and &quot;Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World&quot; (2024).

Bostrom believes that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to superintelligence, which he defines as &quot;any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest&quot;. He views this as a major source of opportunities and existential risks.

==Early life and education==
Born as Niklas Boström in 1973 in Helsingborg, Sweden, he disliked school at a young age and spent his last year of high school learning from home. He was interested in a wide variety of academic areas, including anthropology, art, literature, and science.

He received a B.A. degree from the University of Gothenburg in 1994. He then earned an M.A. degree in philosophy and physics from Stockholm University and an MSc degree in computational neuroscience from King&#x27;s College London in 1996. During his time at Stockholm University, he researched the relationship between language and reality by studying the analytic philosopher W. V. Quine. He also did some turns on London&#x27;s stand-up comedy circuit. In 2000, he was awarded a PhD degree in philosophy from the London School of Economics. His thesis was titled &quot;Observational selection effects and probability&quot;. He held a teaching position at Yale University from 2000 to 2002, and was a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford from 2002 to 2005.

==Research and writing==

=== Existential risk ===
Bostrom&#x27;s research concerns the future of humanity and long-term outcomes. He discusses existential risk, which he defines as one in which an &quot;adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential&quot;. Bostrom is mostly concerned about anthropogenic risks, which are risks arising from human activities, particularly from new technologies such as advanced artificial intelligence, molecular nanotechnology, or synthetic biology.

In 2005, Bostrom founded the Future of Humanity Institute which, until its shutdown in 2024, researched the far future of human civilization. He is also an adviser to the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.

In the 2008 essay collection, &quot;Global Catastrophic Risks&quot;, editors Bostrom and Milan M. Ćirković characterize the relationship between existential risk and the broader class of global catastrophic risks, and link existential risk to observer selection effects and the Fermi paradox.

==== Vulnerable world hypothesis ====
In a paper called &quot;The Vulnerable World Hypothesis&quot;, Bostrom suggests that there may be some technologies that destroy human civilization by default when discovered. Bostrom proposes a framework for classifying and dealing with these vulnerabilities. He also gives counterfactual thought experiments of how such vulnerabilities could have historically occurred, e.g. if nuclear weapons had been easier to develop or had ignited the atmosphere (as Robert Oppenheimer had feared).

=== Digital sentience ===
Bostrom supports the substrate independence principle, the idea that consciousness can emerge on various types of physical substrates, not only in &quot;carbon-based biological neural networks&quot; like the human brain. He considers that &quot;sentience is a matter of degree&quot; and that digital minds can in theory be engineered to have a much higher rate and intensity of subjective experience than humans, using less resources. Such highly sentient machines, which he calls &quot;super-beneficiaries&quot;, would be extremely efficient at achieving happiness. He recommends finding &quot;paths that will enable digital minds and biological minds to coexist, in a mutually beneficial way where all of these different forms can flourish and thrive&quot;.

===Anthropic reasoning===
Bostrom has published numerous articles on anthropic reasoning, as well as the book &quot;Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy&quot;. In the book, he criticizes previous formulations of the anthropic principle, including those of Brandon Carter, John Leslie, John Barrow, and Frank Tipler.

Bostrom believes that the mishandling of indexical information is a common flaw in many areas of inquiry (including cosmology, philosophy, evolution theory, game theory, and quantum physics). He argues that an anthropic theory is needed to deal with these. He introduces the self-sampling assumption (SSA) and analyzes the self-indication assumption (SIA), shows how they lead to different conclusions in a number of cases, and identifies how each is affected by paradoxes or counterintuitive implications in certain thought experiments. He argues against SIA and proposes refining SSA into the strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA), which replaces &quot;observers&quot; in the SSA definition with &quot;observer-moments&quot;.

In later work, he proposed with Milan M. Ćirković and Anders Sandberg the phenomenon of &quot;anthropic shadow&quot;, an observation selection effect that prevents observers from observing certain kinds of catastrophes in their recent geological and evolutionary past. They suggest that events that lie in the anthropic shadow are likely to be underestimated unless statistical corrections are made.

====Simulation argument====
Bostrom&#x27;s simulation argument posits that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:
# The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;
# The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;
# The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.

===Ethics of human enhancement===
Bostrom is favorably disposed toward &quot;human enhancement&quot;, or &quot;self-improvement and human perfectibility through the ethical application of science&quot;, as well as a critic of bio-conservative views.

In 1998, Bostrom co-founded (with David Pearce) the World Transhumanist Association (which has since changed its name to Humanity+). In 2004, he co-founded (with James Hughes) the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, although he is no longer involved with either of these organisations.

In 2005, Bostrom published the short story &quot;The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot;. A shorter version was published in 2012 in &quot;Philosophy Now&quot;. The fable personifies death as a dragon that demands a tribute of thousands of people every day. The story explores how status quo bias and learned helplessness can prevent people from taking action to defeat aging even when the means to do so are at their disposal. YouTuber CGP Grey created an animated version of the story.
With philosopher Toby Ord, he proposed the reversal test in 2006. Given humans&#x27; irrational status quo bias, how can one distinguish between valid criticisms of proposed changes in a human trait and criticisms merely motivated by resistance to change? The reversal test attempts to do this by asking whether it would be a good thing if the trait was altered in the opposite direction.

Bostrom&#x27;s work also considers potential dysgenic effects in human populations but he thinks genetic engineering can provide a solution and that &quot;In any case, the time-scale for human natural genetic evolution seems much too grand for such developments to have any significant effect before other developments will have made the issue moot&quot;.

===Technology strategy===

Bostrom has suggested that technology policy aimed at reducing existential risk should seek to influence the order in which various technological capabilities are attained, proposing the principle of differential technological development. This principle states that we ought to retard the development of dangerous technologies, particularly ones that raise the level of existential risk, and accelerate the development of beneficial technologies, particularly those that protect against the existential risks posed by nature or by other technologies.

In 2011, Bostrom founded the Oxford Martin Program on the Impacts of Future Technology.

Bostrom&#x27;s theory of the unilateralist&#x27;s curse has been cited as a reason for the scientific community to avoid controversial dangerous research such as reanimating pathogens.

===Books===
==== &quot;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies&quot; ====
In 2014, Bostrom published &quot;&quot;, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller.
The book argues that superintelligence is possible and explores different types of superintelligences, their cognition, the associated risks. He also presents technical and strategic considerations on how to make it safe.

===== Characteristics of a superintelligence =====
Bostrom explores multiple possible paths to superintelligence, including whole brain emulation and human intelligence enhancement, but focuses on artificial general intelligence, explaining that electronic devices have many advantages over biological brains.

Bostrom draws a distinction between final goals and instrumental goals. A final goal is what an agent tries to achieve for its own intrinsic value. Instrumental goals are just intermediary steps towards final goals. Bostrom contends there are instrumental goals that will be shared by most sufficiently intelligent agents because they are generally useful to achieve any objective (e.g. preserving the agent&#x27;s own existence or current goals, acquiring resources, improving its cognition...), this is the concept of instrumental convergence. On the other side, he writes that virtually any level of intelligence can in theory be combined with virtually any final goal (even absurd final goals, e.g. making paperclips), a concept he calls the orthogonality thesis.

He argues that an AI with the ability to improve itself might initiate an intelligence explosion, resulting (potentially rapidly) in a superintelligence. Such a superintelligence could have vastly superior capabilities, notably in strategizing, social manipulation, hacking or economic productivity. With such capabilities, a superintelligence could outwit humans and take over the world, establishing a singleton (which is &quot;a world order in which there is at the global level a single decision-making agency&quot;) and optimizing the world according to its final goals.

Bostrom argues that giving simplistic final goals to a superintelligence could be catastrophic:

===== Mitigating the risk =====
Bostrom explores several pathways to reduce the existential risk from AI. He emphasizes the importance of international collaboration, notably to reduce race to the bottom and AI arms race dynamics. He suggests potential techniques to help control AI, including containment, stunting AI capabilities or knowledge, narrowing the operating context (e.g. to question-answering), or &quot;tripwires&quot; (diagnostic mechanisms that can lead to a shutdown). But Bostrom contends that &quot;we should not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever. Sooner or later, it will out&quot;. He thus suggests that in order to be safe for humanity, superintelligence must be aligned with morality or human values so that it is &quot;fundamentally on our side&quot;. Potential AI normativity frameworks include Yudkowsky&#x27;s coherent extrapolated volition (human values improved via extrapolation), moral rightness (doing what is morally right), and moral permissibility (following humanity&#x27;s coherent extrapolated volition except when it&#x27;s morally impermissible).

Bostrom warns that an existential catastrophe can also occur from AI being misused by humans for destructive purposes, or from humans failing to take into account the potential moral status of digital minds. Despite these risks, he says that machine superintelligence seems involved at some point in &quot;all the plausible paths to a really great future&quot;.

===== Public reception =====
The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller and received positive feedback from personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Peter Singer and Derek Parfit. It was praised for offering clear and compelling arguments on a neglected yet important topic. It was sometimes criticized for spreading pessimism about the potential of AI, or for focusing on longterm and speculative risks. Some skeptics such as Daniel Dennett or Oren Etzioni contended that superintelligence is too far away for the risk to be significant. Yann LeCun considers that there is no existential risk, asserting that superintelligent AI will have no desire for self-preservation and that experts can be trusted to make it safe.

Raffi Khatchadourian wrote that Bostrom&#x27;s book on superintelligence &quot;is not intended as a treatise of deep originality; Bostrom&#x27;s contribution is to impose the rigors of analytic philosophy on a messy corpus of ideas that emerged at the margins of academic thought.&quot;

==== &quot;Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World&quot; ====
In his 2024 book, &quot;Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World&quot;, Bostrom explores the concept of an ideal life, if humanity transitions successfully into a post-superintelligence world. Bostrom notes that the question is &quot;not how interesting a future is to look at, but how good it is to live in.&quot; He outlines some technologies that he considers physically possible in theory and available at technological maturity, such as cognitive enhancement, reversal of aging, arbitrary sensory inputs (taste, sound...), or the precise control of motivation, mood, well-being and personality. According to him, not only machines would be better than humans at working, but they would also undermine the purpose of many leisure activities, providing extreme welfare while challenging the quest for meaning.

==Public engagement==
Bostrom has provided policy advice and consulted for many governments and organizations. He gave evidence to the House of Lords, Select Committee on Digital Skills. He is an advisory board member for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, Future of Life Institute, and an external advisor for the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.

=== 1996 email incident ===
In January 2023, Bostrom issued an apology for a 1996 listserv email he sent as a postgrad where he had stated that he thought &quot;Blacks are more stupid than whites&quot;, and where he also used the word &quot;niggers&quot; in a description of how he thought this statement might be perceived by others. The apology, posted on his website, stated that &quot;the invocation of a racial slur was repulsive&quot; and that he &quot;completely repudiate[d] this disgusting email&quot;. 

The email has been described as &quot;racist&quot; in several news sources. According to Andrew Anthony of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The apology did little to placate Bostrom’s critics, not least because he conspicuously failed to withdraw his central contention regarding race and intelligence, and seemed to make a partial defence of eugenics.&quot;

Shortly afterward, Oxford University condemned the language used in the email and started an investigation. The investigation concluded on 10 August 2023: &quot;[W]e do not consider you to be a racist or that you hold racist views, and we consider that the apology you posted in January 2023 was sincere.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bostrom met his wife Susan in 2002. As of 2015, she lived in Montreal and Bostrom in Oxford. They have one son.

<text>USS &quot;Sailfish&quot; (SSR/SS/AGSS-572), the lead ship of her class of submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sailfish, a large gamefish inhabiting tropical seas, related to the swordfish, but possessing scales and a large sail-like dorsal fin.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sailfish&quot; was the first submarine built expressly for radar picket service, and was equipped with BPS-2 and BPS-3 radars in and aft of the sail. She and her sister ship, , were the largest conventionally-powered submarines in the United States Navy since of 1928. Designed to scout in advance of carrier groups using long-range radar, the &quot;Sailfish&quot; class were designed for a high surface speed. However, their speed achieved was not significantly faster than converted World War II radar picket submarines.

&quot;Sailfish&quot; was laid down on 8 December 1953 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 8 September 1955, sponsored by Mrs. Lynde D. McCormick, wife of Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, and commissioned on 14 April 1956.

==Service history==

===1956–1960===
Following trials off the New Hampshire coast, &quot;Sailfish&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea before joining Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 6 at Norfolk, Virginia. In July 1957, she began her first extended deployment with Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. She returned to Norfolk in October and, through the fall of 1958, engaged in local operations, with occasional visits to Caribbean ports. In December, she commenced a seven-month conversion and overhaul at Philadelphia. In April 1959, while the yard work was still in progress, she was transferred to SubRon 10 at New London, Connecticut. &quot;Sailfish&quot; resumed coastal operations out of New London in July, participating in fleet and NATO exercises, providing qualification training for prospective submarine officers and crews, and sharpening her own battle readiness.

===1961–1967===
On 3 February 1961, &quot;Sailfish&quot; was reclassified an attack submarine and given hull classification symbol SS-572, as the submarine radar picket mission ended fleetwide. Airborne radar had superseded it with the full deployment of the Grumman WF-2 Tracer. Over Thanksgiving weekend in 1961 she was dispersed from New London to Rhode Island and while in port there a fire in the deep fat fryer caused significant damage burning nearly all of the cables running through the after battery compartment. She returned to New London at the end of that weekend and the entire crew worked around the clock for five straight days replacing all of the cables. As a result, Sailfish was able to complete an exercise previous assigned by getting underway just six days after the fire. In January 1962 Sailfish entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul. By September 1962, she was preparing for her second Mediterranean deployment and departed New London on 10 October. She operated with Sixth Fleet over the next four months and returned to New London in February 1963, where she participated in local operations through the rest of that year and 1964.

In January 1965, &quot;Sailfish&quot; was transferred to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an extensive &quot;FRAM II&quot; conversion. Thirteen months later, in February 1966, she left the navy yard presenting a more sleek, streamlined appearance, broken only by the deck mounted fins of the new PUFFS sonar system. Her large search radar had been removed. These new fins duplicated on a miniature scale the form of her conning tower, giving her the dorsaled look of a large, beautiful fish, like the sailfish for which she was named. Following an exhaustive checkout of her newly acquired systems and a period of refresher training, she deployed in July for her third Mediterranean tour. After four months, she returned to New London and local operations.

===1967–1978===
On 1 November 1967, she was assigned to SubRon 8 and joined the submarines of Submarine Division (SubDiv) 82, specialists in antisubmarine warfare. She operated out of Groton, Connecticut, until July 1968, then underwent overhaul into February 1969. On 1 July, she was ordered to the Pacific and assigned a new home port, Pearl Harbor. &quot;Sailfish&quot; departed New London on 14 July; transited the Panama Canal; and, after a brief visit to Acapulco, Mexico, proceeded to Hawaii. From Pearl Harbor, she sailed on 9 October for deployment with Seventh Fleet in the western Pacific. &quot;Sailfish&quot; operated out of Yokosuka, Japan. In January 1970, she participated in Allied exercises off Taiwan and Okinawa; in February, she conducted joint training operations with units of the Navy of the Republic of Korea; and, in March, she operated with units of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. On 26 May, &quot;Sailfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor and spent the remainder of the year there in training operations and upkeep.

On 8 February 1971, &quot;Sailfish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her second WestPac deployment. For over six months, she cruised the western Pacific. In late May she joined units of the United States Navy and of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in HUK ASWEX 3-71. By mid-July, she was in the Mindanao Sea participating in another antisubmarine exercise, this time with units of the Philippine Navy. &quot;Sailfish&quot; spent a week in Brisbane, Australia, before returning to Pearl Harbor, on 28 August, for overhaul.

The submarine underwent regular overhaul from 20 October 1971 until 14 July 1972. Between July and December, she operated between Hawaii and the California coast, engaged in trials and type training. On 1 December, &quot;Sailfish&quot; departed San Diego, California, for Yokosuka, Japan, and her third WestPac cruise. She plied the waters of the western Pacific until 4 May 1973, when she departed Subic Bay to return to the United States. She stopped overnight 19/20 May at Pearl Harbor, then continued on to San Diego. For the rest of 1973, she operated off the California coast out of San Diego.

===Decommissioning and fate===
&quot;Sailfish&quot; was decommissioned on 29 September 1978 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the next day. She was to be disposed of by the Security Assistance Program for cash sale to the Bolivian Navy, but remained berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Bremerton, Washington after the fall of the Torrelio government in August 1982. In May 2007 &quot;Sailfish&quot; was expended as a target in a Fleet Training SINKEX, when a Mark 48 ADCAP torpedo fired from the submarine sent her to the bottom at , off the coast of Washington at a depth of 1,451 fathoms .

<text>USS &quot;Salmon&quot; (SSR/SS/AGSS-573), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the salmon.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Salmon&quot; was the second of a class of two radar picket submarines, which were the largest conventionally-powered submarines in the United States Navy since the of 1928. She was equipped with BPS-2 and BPS-3 radars in and aft of the sail. Intended to scout in advance of aircraft carrier groups using long-range radar, the &quot;Sailfish&quot; class were designed for a high surface speed. However, they achieved a speed only a few knots higher than converted World War II radar picket submarines.

&quot;Salmon&quot; was laid down on 10 March 1954 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 25 February 1956, sponsored by Mrs. Albert M. Bontier, widow of Commander A. M. Bontier, who was lost during World War II when the submarine was sunk during a war patrol in the South Pacific early in October 1944. &quot;Salmon&quot; was commissioned on 26 August 1956.

==Service history==

===1956–1959===
&quot;Salmon&quot; conducted her shakedown cruise between 19 February and 10 May 1957, ranging from Newport, Rhode Island, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She departed Portsmouth for the West Coast in late May, transited the Panama Canal on 3 July; visited Callao, Peru; and proceeded to San Diego, California, arriving on 25 July.

&quot;Salmon&quot; conducted local operations in southern California waters, as a unit of Submarine Division 33 (SubDiv 33), until she began her first western Pacific deployment on 23 September. She sailed via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island to join the Seventh Fleet off southern Japan on 19 October. For the remainder of the year she participated in fleet training exercises and special operations, with port calls at Yokosuka, Japan; Hong Kong; Manila and Subic Bay, Philippines; and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. &quot;Salmon&quot; departed Yokosuka on 31 March 1958 and returned to San Diego, California, on 19 April.

Resuming local operations, &quot;Salmon&quot; remained in the San Diego area for the rest of the year. From 6 January 1959 until 30 May, she underwent overhaul and limited conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Giving up a large radome from her superstructure, she gained instrumented Regulus missileguidance capability and improved, longer range sonar. &quot;Salmon&quot; then prepared for her second WestPac deployment.

&quot;Salmon&quot; departed San Diego, California, on 17 July and sailed to Pearl Harbor where her crew received Regulus missile guidance training, then proceeded to Japan and joined Seventh Fleet on 21 August. She operated with the fleet in Allied training exercises, provided services for other Seventh Fleet surface and subsurface units for training purposes, and made visits to various ports, before returning to San Diego on 14 February 1960.

===1960–1970===
Through 1960 and 1961, &quot;Salmon&quot; operated from San Diego, California, with occasional visits to San Francisco, California, Astoria, Oregon, Tacoma, Washington, Port Angeles, Washington, and Esquimalt, British Columbia. On 1 March 1961, she was reclassified an attack submarine and given hull classification symbol SS-573, and, on 1 November, she was reassigned to SubDiv 52. The submarine radar picket mission ended fleetwide at this time as airborne radar superseded it with the full deployment of the Grumman WF-2 Tracer.

On 1 June 1962, &quot;Salmon&quot; departed San Diego for her third WestPac deployment. She visited Papeete, Tahiti, from 13 to 16 June, then proceeded to Yokosuka for duty with Seventh Fleet. She subsequently operated with antisubmarine warfare (ASW) hunter-killer groups in fleet exercises and often engaged in free-play battle problems with individual surface units. During this deployment, she visited Hakodate and Sasebo, Japan; Naha, Okinawa and Hong Kong. &quot;Salmon&quot; returned to San Diego, California, on 20 December and became flagship of Submarine Flotilla 1; and, in addition to that distinction, was awarded the Golden &quot;E&quot; for excellence in battle efficiency for the past five consecutive years, which rated her as the leading submarine of her division. &quot;Salmon&quot; was the first submarine to earn a Golden &quot;E&quot; and was to better that record by winning hashmarks signifying retention of that status during 1963 and 1964.

On the fourth of July in 1963, the Salmon suffered personnel casualties when mercury from a broken thermometer came into contact with a hot grid, creating toxic mercury vapor, resulting in the poisoning of 14 crewmembers.

On 3 June of the latter year, she put into the San Francisco Naval Shipyard to undergo FRAM II conversion. Departing the yard on 19 April 1965, as a modernized &quot;GUPPY III&quot;, she moved to the Puget Sound, Washington, area for evaluation and sound tests. She then returned to San Diego, to resume local operations, on 4 May.

&quot;Salmon&quot; commenced her fourth WestPac deployment on 23 August. She joined Submarine Flotilla (SubFlot) 7 of the Seventh Fleet on 14 September and conducted operations in Japanese and southwest Pacific waters until returning to San Diego on 20 April 1966. &quot;Salmon&quot;″s fifth deployment to the western Pacific was from 20 March to 4 October 1967. During this tour, she provided services to Seventh Fleet units operating off Vietnam in support of Vietnam War operations. In September, she rendezvoused with ballistic missile submarines and somewhere in the Pacific to act as a simulated target submarine for training in antisubmarine tactics.

Through the spring of 1968, &quot;Salmon&quot; underwent overhaul at San Francisco, California, in preparation for support of the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) program, to evaluate submarine rescue and salvage equipment at extreme depths. On 1 June, she was redesignated an auxiliary research submarine and given hull classification symbol AGSS-573 for her role as mother sub and underway submerged launching and recovery platform for the experimental mini-subs. However, delays in the program resulted in her return to San Diego for local operations, following preliminary trials at Puget Sound. She subsequently sailed on 25 October for her sixth WestPac deployment.

In November, &quot;Salmon&quot; visited Yokosuka and Hong Kong. From 4 to 19 December, she conducted special operations off the coast of Vietnam, and, from 26 December 1968 to 10 January 1969, she participated in SEATO exercises out of Sangley Point in the Philippines. She then returned to Yokosuka and then proceeded to Sasebo for special operations before returning to the United States on 5 April. &quot;Salmon&quot; arrived at San Diego, California, on 25 April and conducted local operations for the remainder of the year. She resumed her former hull classification symbol as SS-573 on 30 June.

===1970–1977===
On 3 January 1970, she departed San Diego for her seventh WestPac tour. In February, she conducted type training in the Philippines with submarine and her sister sub, . From there, she visited Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Bangkok, Thailand; Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Kobe, Japan; and Hong Kong. She returned to San Diego on 27 June and resumed local operations. She remained so employed for the rest of 1970 and throughout 1971.

&quot;Salmon&quot; departed San Diego on 17 February 1972 on her eighth deployment to the western Pacific. She entered a harbor of Vietnam during the Vietnam War where she laid mines and gathered intelligence. Her CO was Harry Merwin Yockey. In April, she rescued survivors from the Japanese coastal freighter &quot;Koei Maru Number 2&quot; which sank about south of the entrance to Tokyo Bay. In July, she joined units of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force in an antisubmarine warfare exercise. &quot;Salmon&quot; departed Pago Pago on 13 August and re-entered San Diego on 26 August.

She remained on the west coast for the remainder of 1972 and for the first five and one-half months of 1973. On 16 June, she headed west for what was to have been her ninth deployment to the Far East. Upon her arrival in Pearl Harbor, the deployment was canceled due to damage to her number three and number four main engines. On 10 August she sailed back to San Diego to prepare for overhaul. &quot;Salmon&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 17 November and commenced overhaul nine days later.
===Decommissioning and fate===
&quot;Salmon&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1977. In 1992 &quot;Salmon&quot; was converted to a shallow water sonar target and sunk near Hudson Canyon, south of Long Island, as a bottom target on 5 June 1993.

<doc id="408301" wikidata="Q443395" url="?curid=408301" title="Jason Everman">
<text>Jason Mark Everman (born October 16, 1967) is an American musician and soldier who played guitar with Nirvana and Mind Funk, and bass in Soundgarden and OLD. He later served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan with the U.S. Army as an Army Ranger and Green Beret. As of May 2017, Everman plays the guitar in a military veteran band called Silence &amp; Light.

==Early life==
In a 2013 interview with &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Everman said when asked about his birthplace, &quot;My birth certificate says Kodiak, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was Ouzinkie, where my parents lived in a two-room cabin with a pet ocelot named Kia.&quot; His parents had moved to the remote Spruce Island to, as guitarist and writer Clay Tarver put it, &quot;get back to nature&quot;, but their marriage did not &quot;work out&quot;. His mother left with Jason when he was a toddler, moved to Washington, and married a former Navy serviceman; the family eventually settled in Poulsbo, across Puget Sound from Seattle.

According to Everman&#x27;s half-sister, with whom he grew up, &quot;My mother was extremely depressed, an artistic genius who was also a pill-popping alcoholic. Jason and I learned to walk on eggshells and really learned to take care of ourselves.&quot; After an incident in which he and a friend blew up a toilet with an M-80 firecracker, his grandmother put him in therapy sessions to deal with his emotional issues. Everman began playing guitar during the therapy sessions; he initially picked up one of the guitars the therapist kept around his office, and the therapist then decided to play with him, hoping it would help him open up. He went on to play in several bands during his high school years. Also, he reestablished contact with his biological father, who by that time owned a fishing boat in Alaska, and worked several seasons on the boat. Prior to joining with Nirvana, he played guitar in a local band called Stonecrow with future Nirvana drummer Chad Channing.

==Early musical career==
Everman joined Nirvana in February 1989 as a second guitarist. He is listed as being second guitarist on Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Bleach&quot; and appears on the cover, but did not actually play on any of the tracks. Nirvana founder Kurt Cobain said the credit was a token of thanks to Everman for paying a fee of $606.17 to record the album. On the 2009 remastered edition of &quot;Bleach&quot;, Everman is no longer credited but can still be seen on the front cover and he is given special thanks in the booklet.

Everman toured with Nirvana the summer of 1989 in support of &quot;Bleach&quot;. He can be heard playing guitar on &quot;Trust No-One&quot;, an unofficial release of a live performance in Boston. Cobain had broken his guitar the previous night and only provided vocals, leaving the guitar playing to Everman. Everman can also be seen in the bootleg video of Nirvana playing an &quot;in store&quot; performance at Rhino Records in Los Angeles on June 23, 1989. During his time with Nirvana, he could sometimes be seen using Fender guitars, generally the Fender Telecaster. Nirvana fired Everman after the tour ended due to his moodiness.

A two-song Nirvana session featuring Everman on guitar is available, albeit in separate releases. A Kiss cover called &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; was released on the 1990 tribute album &quot;Hard to Believe: A Kiss Covers Compilation&quot;, and &quot;Dive&quot; was released on 2004&#x27;s &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;. Both tracks were recorded at the Evergreen State College&#x27;s 24-track studio in June 1989.

Everman next joined Soundgarden in Fall of 1989 as Hiro Yamamoto&#x27;s temporary successor on bass. In April of that year, he played on the band&#x27;s cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Come Together&quot;, which appeared on an EP called &quot;Loudest Love&quot;. Everman appeared in Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Louder Than Live&quot; home video. Everman left immediately after Soundgarden completed its promotional tour for &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; in mid-1990 to play bass for the band OLD (Old Lady Drivers), at which time Soundgarden found Yamamoto&#x27;s ultimate successor, bassist Ben Shepherd. Later, in 1993, he played guitar in Mind Funk.

==Later life==
In September 1994, influenced by Renaissance icon Benvenuto Cellini (who stated that a well-rounded man is an artist, warrior and philosopher), he left Mind Funk to enlist in the United States Army, subsequently serving with the Army&#x27;s 2nd Ranger Battalion, Delta Company and later with the Special Forces, serving tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. After completing his service, he took a break from the military and lived in New York City where he briefly worked as a bike messenger. He then traveled to Tibet and worked and studied in a Buddhist monastery before returning to the U.S. He reentered the Army when offered the chance to join Special Forces.

After receiving an honorable discharge in 2006, Everman went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Columbia University School of General Studies on May 20, 2013. General Stanley A. McChrystal wrote a letter of recommendation for his application. In September 2010, Everman conducted an interview with Music Life Radio detailing his life. He also briefly appears in a 2010 documentary about Motörhead frontman Lemmy where he described Motorhead as &quot;Good go-to-war music.&quot;

In July 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a portrait on Everman, written by guitarist and writer Clay Tarver. The article features interviews with Everman, his family members, former band colleagues, music industry people, and soldiers. A 2014 &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; interview mentions that Everman was invited to attend Nirvana&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, that he lives in New York, has participated in writing workshops and &quot;still goes overseas regularly, working as a consultant for the military.&quot;

Everman earned a Master&#x27;s in Military History from Norwich University in 2017.

In May 2017, Everman met fellow veteran Brad Thomas in New York and the two decided to start a band named Silence &amp; Light. By July, the band had a complete lineup consisting of military veterans with Everman playing the guitar. They began recording an album in January 2019 in Van Nuys, California. The band released a complete album in December 2019. The band&#x27;s profits are dedicated to helping members of the Special Operations Community, the Military, and First Responders. The band said they consider their genre to be modern rock.

In April 2023, Everman appeared as a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience to talk about his life and career.

<doc id="408309" wikidata="Q7239011" url="?curid=408309" title="Prayer circle">
<text>A prayer circle is most simply where participants join hands in a literal circle of prayer, often as part of a vigil. Informal prayer circles have been practiced for centuries. Their recent resurgence in popularity is frequently attributed to their use in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement. Similarly, amongst North American and specifically Native American Catholics, prayer circles have formed around Kateri Tekakwitha, who was the first Native American to be beatified by the Roman Catholic Church. Tekakwitha Conference prayer circles, called Kateri Prayer Circles, have been formed on nearly all U.S. Indian Reservations. In Islam, Muslims who make the pilgrimage to Mecca will form concentric circles around the Kaaba in prayer, and these too are commonly referred to as prayer circles.

A prayer circle may also refer to some online communities where people share their thoughts and prayers with other like-minded worshippers, usually within specially-designated message board areas.

==Origin==
Ritual prayer in a circle around an altar is not unique to Christianity. Ritual ceremonies around an altar are common in paganism, and ritual prayer dances around an altar were practiced by early Christians, especially Gnostics, before the practice was condemned as a heresy by the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 A.D. (&quot;See&quot; Nibley, &quot;The Early Christian Prayer Circle&quot;, page 41.) Much later, Protestants began conducting informal prayer circles. Sometimes these communities are developed online.

==Online ==
With the World Wide Web&#x27;s rapid growth among all sectors of society, many Christians and other faith-based peoples have found a niche on the Internet, where they can share their prayers, thoughts and wishes with each other. It is not known who was the first to set up an online prayer circle, but today there are dozens, if not hundreds, of Web sites set up for these purposes, from large-scale sites run by The American Bible Society and Beliefnet to smaller message boards run by community churches.

An online prayer circle is often a vigil set up by a participant in honor of someone close to that participant. Larger online prayer circles are also formed in honor and remembrance of the victims of notable disasters or tragedies. Though religious in tone, online prayer circles are generally non-denominational and at times are not even explicitly Christian.

==Mormonism==
In Mormonism, a prayer circle is a mode of prayer practiced by Mormons who have taken part in the endowment ceremony. Established by Joseph Smith in 1842 or 1843, he called it the &quot;true order of prayer&quot;. The ritual involves one person offering a prayer while surrounded by a circle of participants. The members of the circle repeat the words of the prayer. Earlier Mormons had practiced conventional Protestant-type prayer circles at least as early as 1833.

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest branch of the Latter Day Saint movement, prayer circles since 1978 are no longer practiced outside of temples, and members of the church do not take part in prayer circles except as part of an endowment ceremony.
