<text>XGI Technology Inc. () was a Taiwanese hardware company. It was based upon the old graphics division of Silicon Integrated Systems (SiS) spun off as a separate company, and the graphics assets of Trident Microsystems.
It existed from 2003 to 2010. 

==History==
Founded in June 2003 and headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, it was sometimes called eXtreme Graphics Innovation and headed by Chris Lin.
In December 2003, XGI announced the Volari Duo, a graphics card with two GPUs. This was seen as part of a potentially successful attempt to become competitive with ATI Technologies and Nvidia Corporation, which were the two largest GPU manufacturers in the world at the time.

A few months after the announced release, XGI graphics cards were found by enthusiasts and hardware reviewers to be less than competitive with ATi and Nvidia cards. Some of the many performance and visualization problems were blamed on underdeveloped drivers. Even so, XGI cards received good reviews in the low price/low performance video card market: XGI Volari V3 cards were judged by some reviewers to be competitive and even superior to equally priced video cards that were on the market, such as a Nvidia GeForce MX 4000 card. Many reviewers though were pessimistic of the possibility that XGI would be competitive in the 3D graphics card market.

On 6 March 2006, ATI Technologies announced the acquisition of Shanghai-based MacroSynergy, a fabless chip designer and XGI Technology alliance company, as well as related personnel working out of XGI Technology&#x27;s Santa Clara, California location.

On 2006-10-17, RealVision Inc. announced forming technology alliance with XGI Technology Inc. On 2006-10-23, RealVision Inc. announced VREngine/XMD-Advanced series video cards, which used the previously canceled Volari 8300 (named Volari XG47), for use in medical imaging. Mass production was set to begin on 2007Q1.

On 27 May 2010, Silicon Integrated Systems (SIS) took control of XGI Technology and its iTV technology with an unveiling soon after.

In October, 2010, it was reported that SiS acquired the rest of XGI&#x27;s assets.

<text>The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella is a 1976 British musical retelling the classic fairy tale of Cinderella. The film was chosen as the Royal Command Performance motion picture selection for 1976.

Directed by Bryan Forbes, the film stars Gemma Craven as the heroine, Richard Chamberlain as the prince, and features a supporting cast led by Michael Hordern, Kenneth More, Edith Evans, and Annette Crosbie. The film&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated songs were written by the Sherman Brothers – Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman – who also shared scripting duties with Forbes.

==Plot== 
Prince Edward of Euphrania returns home after meeting the princess Selena of Carolsveld, whom his parents have arranged for him to marry. However, Edward did not propose to Selena, and angrily denounces arranged marriages (&quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Be Two People?&quot;). Edward prefers to marry for love while his parents want a political alliance (&quot;What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married?&quot;).

Meanwhile, Cinderella&#x27;s cruel stepmother has banished her to the cellar, and forces her to work as a servant to her and her two vindictive daughters, Isobella and Palatine. Cinderella finds some comfort in remembering happier times (&quot;Once I Was Loved&quot;). Whilst putting flowers by her parents&#x27; grave, she inadvertently stumbles upon the prince, and his friend and bodyguard John, who are visiting the Royal crypt. The Prince sardonically talks about his dead ancestors, with whom he will one day be buried (&quot;What a Comforting Thing to Know&quot;).

Back at the castle, the King of Euphrania is advised that a marriage between Edward and a Princess from one of Euphrania&#x27;s neighboring countries (and thus potential enemies) would help prevent war. A ball is seen as the perfect way to help Edward choose his bride (&quot;Protocolligorically Correct&quot;). The Prince hates the idea, though his cousin Montague is delighted (&quot;Bride-finding Ball&quot;). When news arrives that Carolsveld intends to make war on Euphrania, Edward has no choice but to accept. However, fewer than half the princesses accept the invitation, so the local nobility, including Cinderella&#x27;s stepmother and stepsisters, are invited.

Because of the lack of dresses at the dressmakers, the stepmother and stepsisters demand that Cinderella sew all three of them elegant gowns for the ball from the fabric of their old dresses. Cinderella has no idea what to do. As luck would have it a fairy godmother, who has a talent for sensing the wishes of those who are pure in heart, arrives and creates three beautiful gowns while Cinderella rests. That night, the stepmother and stepsisters depart for the ball leaving Cinderella alone. Cinderella&#x27;s fairy godmother returns and informs Cinderella that she too can go to the ball. She transforms Cinderella&#x27;s shabby dress into a lovely gown, arranges her hair in the period fashion, and a coach and horses are magically prepared. Cinderella is sent off to the ball with a warning that the magic can only last until midnight (&quot;Suddenly It Happens&quot;). It is love at first sight when Cinderella and Edward meet at the ball (&quot;Secret Kingdom&quot;). As the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella races away, leaving behind only her glass slipper (&quot;He / She Danced With Me&quot;).

Edward sends his servants out far and wide in search of the woman who fits the glass slipper. The searchers return empty-handed. Edward builds a monument for the slipper and hopes that one day his lost love will turn up. John is also suffering as a result of love: he is in love with a noblewoman, but his position forbids them to be together (&quot;Position and Positioning&quot;). Edward knights John, so John can pursue his romance with Lady Caroline. Finally, frustrated by his fruitless search, Edward breaks the monument, tossing the slipper into the woods where Cinderella finds and starts to dance with it, which catches John&#x27;s attention and he rushes off to inform the Prince.

Cinderella and Edward are reunited and greeted by her stepmother and stepsisters. Edward asks the permission of the stepmother to marry Cinderella and she gives full permission, if only to get Cinderella off her hands. Cinderella tells her stepmother and stepsisters that she forgives them for their abuse. In the throne room, Edward and Cinderella go before the King and Queen. Whilst the King and Queen find Cinderella to be charming, something seems to be troubling the King. He takes the Lord Chamberlain aside and tells him that there is no way his son and Cinderella, a non-royal, can be married. The Lord Chamberlain conveys this to Cinderella, explaining also that a military alliance through marriage must be established with one of the neighboring kingdoms to protect them against war and to secure the safety and future existence of Euphrania. Along with this disheartening news, it is also explained that she will have to be exiled that very night to avoid a war with Carolsveld. Brokenhearted, Cinderella asks the Lord Chamberlain to tell Edward that she never loved him, because she knows that Edward will try to find her because of his love for her (&quot;Tell Him&quot;).

After finding out what the King has done to Cinderella from John, an exasperated Edward confronts him for ruining his chances of a love and happy marriage. Realizing the situation at hand and how the King and Queen won&#x27;t give up their stance on a political marriage, he agrees to marry whomever they choose, but says that his marital duties will go no further than the altar. He lays a curse that their royal house will die with him and throw Euphrania into chaos. The King now feels guilt over exiling Cinderella, but he had no choice due to his own fears of a war with Carolsveld. On the day of his wedding, Edward begs Cinderella to forgive him for marrying Selena, unaware that the fairy godmother heard him. Cinderella living peacefully in exile in another country, still thinks of Edward (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget the Melody&quot;). Her fairy godmother arrives and asks Cinderella why she isn&#x27;t at the castle as Edward is getting married that day. Cinderella, surprised, asks who Edward is marrying. The fairy godmother doesn&#x27;t know, as it&#x27;s most certainly the wrong woman, but plans to set things right—again.

Back at the castle, as the wedding is taking place, everyone is surprised when Cinderella shows up in a wedding gown. The King interrupts the wedding and he and his council meet in private. The fairy godmother joins the discussion and convinces the king to change the law, so that Edward can marry the girl of his choice. In a surprising twist, Edward&#x27;s cousin and the chosen bride fall in love at first sight, and marry, thus fulfilling the alliance after all. Cinderella and Edward live happily ever after.

They were also excised from the North American soundtrack LP (MCA 2097). In 2003, conductor John Wilson included some of Morley&#x27;s incidental music in a compilation album (Dutton Vocalion CDSA 6807) of her vast repertoire of music.

==Production==
The film was announced in 1975 under the title &quot;The Story of Cinderella&quot;. Over 800 girls were considered for the part of Cinderella and around 150 were auditioned before Gemma Craven was chosen. Over 300 costumes were made for the film. It was shot between England and Austria, some of the locations include: Salzburg and Anif Palace, Broughton Castle near Banbury in Oxfordshire and Southwark Cathedral in London.

The scene where Cinderella sings &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget the Melody&quot;, where she sits on a swing, is a reference to &quot;The Swing&quot;, a painting by Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Every detail of Cinderella&#x27;s costume and setting are identical to Fragonard&#x27;s painting, including the colour of her dress and the style of her hat.

Cinderella and the Prince dance the Ländler, a traditional Austrian dance, to their first waltz. (The same dance is also seen in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.)

It was Lockwood&#x27;s first feature since 1955.

The film was entirely financed by the Sultan of Oman who wanted to invest in a film. The approached John Asprey who contacted Bryan Forbes and asked if he had a film. Forbes had just been approached by David Frost who had &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; project. Forbes rewrote the script in ten days. &quot;Very successful film,&quot; Forbes commented.

==Release==
After premiering as Royal Film Performance on 24 March 1976, the film was released in the United Kingdom by Cinema International Corporation on 25 March and in the United States on 4 November by Universal Pictures.

===Reception===
At 24 March 1976 Royal Film Performance of &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; the Queen Mother commented to the songwriters, &quot;The waltz you wrote for the ballroom scene is the most beautiful song I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Vincent Canby said: &quot;Mr. Forbes and Robert Sherman, authors of the screenplay, have stretched the fable without mercy, largely to accommodate a whole bunch of forgettable songs by the Shermans, who did very well by &#x27;Mary Poppins&#x27; and &#x27;Tom Sawyer,&#x27; but who, when off stride, as here, sound as if they&#x27;re parodying the worst of the Broadway musical theater of the &#x27;50s.&quot; Canby added that as the Prince and Cinderella, &quot;Mr. Chamberlain and Miss Craven have impossible roles that are less like characters in a fairy tale than pictures on a jar of peanut butter.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an intelligent and happy blend of as pure an entertainment as has been seen here in some considerable time,&quot; with &quot;fine performances by a splendid cast of British actors,&quot; particularly Michael Hordern, who &quot;steals many a scene as the King, in one of his best performances ever.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;The songs aren&#x27;t memorable, but the king and fairy godmother are.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated, &quot;The virtues of the movie, not necessarily in this order, are that it is richly produced, pleasantly witty, and graced by some colorful and engaging performances. It should earn some grown-up gratitude because it demonstrates that family fare does not have to be childish ... The defects are not such as to dent seriously the satisfaction of having so stylish and good-hearted a movie around. But it really is a familiar trip, however luxurious the vehicle, and the last 20 minutes or so seem very long and slow indeed.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;won&#x27;t be remembered as one of the great musicals, but it&#x27;s more diverting than I supposed,&quot; further noting that the script &quot;does have agreeable outbursts of silliness and fancy. Michael Hordern as the worried, abstracted king and Annette Crosbie as Cinderella&#x27;s brisk, humorous fairy godmother are consistently delightful.&quot; Brenda Davies of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;The songs are not very memorable but they are enjoyable and appropriate in their context; the choreography too fits neatly into the plot but is not in itself particularly imaginative. But these shortcomings are abundantly outweighed by the wit and zest of both writing and playing.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==In popular culture==
*In the 2006 London play, &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;, playwright Peter Morgan makes reference to David Frost&#x27;s involvement as executive producer on &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; suggesting that Frost is more &quot;entertainer&quot; than serious journalist.

==Stage adaptations==
The 1984 musical adaptation by Philip Burley, with songs by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, has been mounted often by British community theatre groups, including in 2001 by the Bilston Operatic Company, Wolverhampton, in May 2008 at the Minack Theatre in Cornwall, in 2011 at the York Theatre Royal, and in 2013 by BOST Musicals at the Liverpool Empire Theatre.

It made its North American premiere in 2005 at the Hale Center Theatre in West Valley City, Utah. Other productions were staged in 2008 at the Tacoma Musical Playhouse in Tacoma, Washington, and in 2011 by Productions Coracole at the Beaubois Theatre in Montreal, Quebec.

==Home video==
MCA Discovision put out the film on Laserdisc in 1978. This release features monaural sound and a 1.33:1 pan and scanned transfer of the shorter US release with the songs &quot;What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget the Melody&quot; omitted. As it was never put out on VHS by MCA, the MCA Laserdisc was the only US video release of any kind prior to 2000, likely due to Universal&#x27;s distribution rights lapsing and having reverted to production company Paradine.

In the UK and Australia, where it was more successful, it spanned several VHS releases by the likes of Video Gems and CEL Home Video respectively. These releases feature the full length UK theatrical version, which includes the songs &quot;What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget the Melody&quot; that were cut from the US release.

In 2000, independent distributor Castle Hill (who had acquired US distribution rights in the mid-1990s) licensed the film to Image Entertainment for a US VHS and DVD release in its full length UK theatrical version. Extras on the DVD version include a video interview with the Sherman Brothers, an audio commentary by director Bryan Forbes, and a promotional featurette. This release is long out of print and was highly sought after prior to 2013.

On 19 November 2013, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Inception Media Group, under licence from Castle Hill successor Westchester Films. This release utilizes a new 4K restoration of the UK theatrical version performed by Pinewood and a PCM 2.0 mix of the 4-Track Stereo, a 5.1 DTS Master Audio remix, and the isolated score in DTS-MA 5.1. In addition to porting over all the extras and the audio commentary from the Image Entertainment DVD, the only new supplement is the UK theatrical trailer mastered from a 35mm element. The film has also received overseas Blu-Ray releases from Second Sight in the UK and Orustak Pictures in Japan, both utilizing the Pinewood 4K restoration and most extras from the Inception release.

On 5 February 2019, Shout Factory (who had purchased Westchester Films in 2017 and reincorporated their titles under the Shout Factory branding) reissued the film on DVD and Blu-Ray. This reissue is almost identical to the prior Inception Media Group release utilizing the same Pinewood restoration and supplements, only down to video encoding differences and the 2.0 stereo track being DTS Master Audio.

<text>Michael Stephen Lolich (born September 12, 1940) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher from 1963 until 1979, almost entirely for the Detroit Tigers. A three-time All-Star, Lolich is most notable for his performance in the 1968 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals when he earned three complete-game victories, including a win over Bob Gibson in the climactic Game 7. At the time of his retirement in 1979, Lolich held the Major League Baseball record for career strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher.

==Early years==
Lolich was born in Portland, Oregon of Croatian descent. He was born right-handed but, began to throw left-handed after a childhood accident. At age two, he rode his tricycle into a parked motorcycle, which fell on him. The accident broke his left collarbone, requiring him to wear a cast for four months. Post-injury efforts to strengthen the left arm helped Lolich develop into throwing left-handed. Known as an eccentric, a sports writer in 1964 wrote of Lolich: &quot;He now eats, writes and bats right-handed, pitches left-handed and thinks sideways.&quot;

As a teenager, he excelled playing in American Legion Baseball and in the Babe Ruth League, setting Oregon state records for strikeouts. He attended Lincoln High School in Portland and posted a record of 19 wins against 5 losses for the school team in 1958.

==Professional baseball==
===Knoxville and Durham===
Lolich was signed by the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent at age 17 on June 30, 1958. He began his professional career playing the 1959, 1960, and 1961 seasons with the Knoxville Smokies of the South Atlantic League and the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League. In his first three seasons, he compiled a 17–29 record in 82 games.

===Denver and Portland===
Lolich was assigned to the Triple-A Denver Bears at the start of the 1962 season and went 0–4 with a 16.50 ERA in nine games. After the poor start, Detroit ordered him back to Knoxville. Lolich refused to report to Knoxville and was placed under indefinite suspension. He returned home to Oregon and struck out all 12 batters he faced in a four-inning outing in semi-pro ball with the Archer Blower team in Portland. In early June, Lolich was acquired by the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in a deal with the Tigers. Lolich turned his career around, compiling a 10–9 record and 3.95 ERA with 138 strikeouts in 23 games with the Beavers. The key to Lolich&#x27;s turnaround was finding control of his pitches. He had developed a reputation as &quot;a flamethrowing wildman&quot; in the minors but developed his control while playing for Portland.

===Detroit Tigers===
====1963–1967====
Buoyed by a strong performance with Portland, Lolich was reclaimed by the Tigers in 1963. He irked Detroit&#x27;s management by reporting late to spring training, saying he had remained in Portland to take an examination to become a mailman during the off-season. He was cut by the Tigers on April 3 and optioned to the Syracuse Chiefs, then recalled to Detroit on May 9 after compiling a 2.45 ERA in 22 innings at Syracuse. He made his major league debut on May 12 and secured his first win on May 28, allowing one run in nine innings against the Los Angeles Angels. He was plagued by lack of run support during his rookie campaign, losing a 2–1 decision on July 29, allowing only one hit through innings before giving up a home run in the ninth inning. He finished the 1963 season with a 5–9 record, 3.55 ERA, and 103 strikeouts in innings pitched.

Lolich blossomed in 1964 with an 18–9 record and 3.41 ERA in 232 innings pitched. He pitched his first shutout, a three-hitter against the Minnesota Twins, on April 24. On September 9, he pitched his sixth shutout of the season and struck out 12 Yankees. For the season, Lolich ranked fourth in the American League with six shutouts and fifth with 192 strikeouts.

In November 1964, Lolich married Joyce Fleenor, a former airline stewardess from Los Angeles. At spring training in 1965, Lolich told reporter Joe Falls that marriage had a calming influence on him: &quot;She&#x27;s done so much for me, to settle me down, that I can hardly put it into words. She&#x27;s made me a very happy guy.&quot;

In 1965, he compiled a 15–9 record with a 3.44 ERA. His 226 strikeouts ranked second in the American League behind Sam McDowell. Always known as a weak hitter, Lolich hit .058 and struck out 37 times in 86 at-bats during the 1965 season.

After two strong seasons, Lolich regressed in 1966. His ERA jumped by more than a run to 4.77, and he compiled a 14–14 record in 40 games. After the season, Lolich rejected claims that his weight was the problem. He noted that he weighed 200 pounds when he won 18 games in 1964 and weighed only two pounds more in 1966. Lolich instead opined: &quot;The big problem for me was loss of concentration. I blew a lot of leads this year.&quot;

In 1967, the Tigers hired former major league pitcher Johnny Sain as their pitching coach. Sain helped develop Lolich&#x27;s pitching skills and taught him psychological aspects of pitching. The 1967 season was a memorable one for the tight four-way pennant race among the Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox. The Tigers were in contention until the final day of the 1967 season, finishing one game behind the Red Sox. Lolich finished the season with a 14–13 record, but led the league with six shutouts.

In late July 1967, Lolich was called to active duty with the Michigan Air National Guard in response to the ongoing riot. Lolich spent twelve days on active duty and was promoted to Airman First Class. Upon returning to the team, he received death threats, allegedly from the Black Panthers, for his role in quelling the riot. In response, the Federal Bureau of Investigation placed a team of snipers on the roof of Tiger Stadium during his subsequent two starts.

====1968 World Series championship====
In 1968, the Tigers quickly rose to first place, winning nine straight after losing the season opener to Boston. Lolich was overshadowed by teammate Denny McLain&#x27;s 31-win season, and was sent to the bullpen in August due to a late-season slump. He made six appearances as a relief pitcher before returning to the starting rotation. He posted a 17–9 record with 197 strikeouts, as the Tigers won the American League pennant by 12 games over the second-place Baltimore Orioles.

After Bob Gibson defeated McLain in Game 1 of the 1968 World Series in St. Louis, Lolich helped Detroit recover by allowing only one run to win Game 2 8–1. He also helped his own cause by hitting the only home run of his 16-year career. But the Tigers lost the next two games at home to fall behind the Cardinals 3–1 and were facing elimination when Lolich returned to pitch in Game 5, just four days after pitching a complete game. Despite an unsettled start, when he surrendered an RBI single to Curt Flood and a two-run home run to Orlando Cepeda in the first inning, Lolich remained calm and proceeded to pitch eight scoreless innings as the Tigers scored two runs in the fourth and took the lead in the seventh on Al Kaline&#x27;s bases loaded two-run single. They added another run for a 5–3 win, staving off elimination.

Back in St. Louis, the Tigers then won Game 6 by a score of 13–1 behind McLain&#x27;s solid pitching and a grand slam home run from Jim Northrup in a Series-record-tying ten-run third inning rally to force Game 7. With just two days of rest, and having pitched two complete games in the past week, Lolich faced Gibson in Game 7, both having won their previous two starts. They each pitched six scoreless innings, Lolich picking off Lou Brock and Curt Flood to end a Cardinal threat in the bottom of the sixth, before the Tigers broke through with three runs in the top of the seventh starting with a two-out, two-run triple to deep center by Northrup just over Flood&#x27;s head for an eventual 4–1 Tigers win and a 4–3 Series triumph.

Detroit became only the third team in World Series history to rally from a 3–1 series deficit to win in seven games. Having completed Game 7, Lolich became the 12th pitcher to win three games in a World Series, and the last with three complete games in a single Series. He was the last pitcher with three victories in the same World Series until Randy Johnson won 3 games in the 2001 World Series. He is the only left-handed pitcher with three complete-game wins in the same World Series in baseball history. No other pitcher has thrown three complete game World Series victories in the same series since. Lolich&#x27;s performance earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.

====1969–1975====
In 1969, Lolich won 19 games and earned his first All-Star selection. He struck out 16 batters in a game twice in 1969, his career high. 1971 marked the best season of Lolich&#x27;s career when, he led the American League in victories (25), games started (45), complete games (29), strikeouts (308) and innings pitched (376), all career-highs. His 308 strikeouts is also a Tigers&#x27; team record. At the 1971 All-Star Game which featured 21 future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, Lolich pitched the final two innings to preserve the first All-Star game victory by an American League team since 1962. He finished second to Vida Blue in the 1971 Cy Young Award voting. Lolich became known for his endurance and his ability to pitch complete games. He reached the 300-innings pitched mark every season between 1971 and 1974.

Lolich won 22 games and posted a career-best 2.50 ERA in 1972 to help the Tigers win the American League Eastern Division championship. He pitched impressively in the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, posting a 1.42 ERA in two starts. In Game 1, he pitched 10 innings allowing only 1 run before losing the game in the bottom of the 11th inning on an unearned run. He pitched nine innings in Game 4, again allowing only 1 run, but the win went to reliever John Hiller as the Tigers rallied in the 10th inning. The Tigers eventually lost the series to Oakland in five games. He finished third in the 1972 Cy Young Award voting behind Gaylord Perry and Wilbur Wood.

Lolich won 16 games in 1973 and 1974. However, the Tigers dropped to last place in the American League East. In 1975, Lolich eclipsed Warren Spahn’s Major League Baseball record of 2,583 career strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher. Although Lolich pitched effectively in 1975, the Tigers&#x27; poor performance continued as they failed to provide him with much offensive support. He received only 14 runs of support during a 14-game stretch in which his win–loss record was 1–13, even though he managed to post a respectable 3.88 earned run average in that period.

===Mets and Padres===
Lolich was traded with Billy Baldwin to the New York Mets for Rusty Staub and Bill Laxton on December 12, 1975. As a major leaguer for at least ten years with the last five on the same ballclub, he had initially exercised his right to veto, which he eventually lifted after his attorney and Mets administrators M. Donald Grant, Joe McDonald and Bob Scheffing convinced him that the transaction was financially beneficial and would not negatively affect his family.

Lolich posted an 8–13 record with a respectable 3.22 ERA for the Mets in 1976; however, he had disagreements with the Mets pitching coach as well as the Mets trainer and retired after the season. He opened a doughnut shop in suburban Detroit and sat out the 1977 season. He returned to baseball in 1978, signing with the San Diego Padres as a free agent.

He played mostly as a relief pitcher for the Padres in 1978, going 2–1 with a 1.56 ERA in 20 games. The following season, Lolich added a knuckleball to his pitching. Lolich had an inconsistent season in 1979 and decided to retire. He pitched in his final major league game on September 23, 1979, at the age of 39.

==Career statistics==
In a 16-year major league career, Lolich played in 586 games, accumulating a 217–191 win–loss record along with a 3.44 earned run average. He struck out 200 or more batters in a season seven times in his career. His 2,832 career strikeouts were the most by a left-handed pitcher in Major League history until he was surpassed by Steve Carlton in 1981, and the most in the American League by a left-handed pitcher until being surpassed by CC Sabathia in 2017. Lolich threw 41 shutouts and 195 complete games during his career, completing nearly 40 percent of his starts. He holds Detroit Tigers team records in single-season strikeouts (308), career strikeouts (2,679), shutouts (39), games started (459) and home runs allowed (329).

In 1,017 plate appearances, he had 105 walks and 90 hits. He has the most career plate appearances of anyone with more walks than hits.

==Life after baseball==

In 1979, Lolich invested in a doughnut shop in Rochester, Michigan, with the understanding that his partner would run the business. Following disagreements, Lolich bought out his partner and began running the business. After losing his lease, he moved the doughnut business to Lake Orion in 1983. In the late 1990s, Lolich sold the doughnut shop and retired. He remained active in charity work and served as a coach at the Detroit Tigers&#x27; baseball fantasy camp in Lakeland, Florida. Because of his humble &quot;everyman&quot; qualities, many long-time Tiger fans celebrate him as one of the most popular sports figures in a working man&#x27;s city. As &quot;The Detroit News&quot; put it, &quot;He didn&#x27;t act like a big shot superstar, he was one of us.&quot;

Lolich also had a small role in &quot;The Incredible Melting Man&quot;, a 1977 horror movie released during his first retirement. He plays a security guard who is killed by the Melting Man near the end of the movie.

In 2003, Lolich was one of 26 players chosen for the final ballot by the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Veterans Committee but garnered only 13 votes, far below the 75% required for election. Lolich had previously appeared on the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot for all 15 years of the allotted time players were eligible to stay on the ballot, topping out at 25.5% of the vote in 1988 before falling off of the ballot in 1999.

In 1982, Lolich was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2022, he was inducted in the Croatian-American Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Dobbs County, North Carolina was a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina.

==History==
Dobbs County was formed in 1758 from Johnston County, though the legislative act that created it did not become effective until April 10, 1759. It was named for Arthur Dobbs, colonial governor of North Carolina from 1754 until 1764. 

In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, the western part was designated as Wayne County. The county seat was moved from its original location on Walnut Creek to the town of Kingston, which was renamed Kinston in 1784. Dobbs went unrepresented in the 1788 Hillsboro Convention to vote on the new constitution of the United States. The federalist delegation was elected without opposition. The anti-federalists abstained. Federalists rioted, as they had done in the previous election after predicting Richard Caswell&#x27;s loss, stealing the ballot box, and assaulting the sheriff. Hertford County also suffered a federalist riot. Because the name Dobbs reminded residents of the rejected colonial past, in 1791 the county was divided by the North Carolina legislature into Glasgow (later renamed Greene County) and Lenoir counties; Dobbs ceased to exist.

<text>Nenê (; born Maybyner Rodney Hilário; September 13, 1982) is a Brazilian former professional basketball player. Known previously as Nenê Hilario, he legally changed his name to simply Nenê in 2003.

==Early life==
Born Maybyner Rodney Hilário in São Carlos, Brazil, he was nicknamed &quot;Nenê&quot; (a variation of Brazilian Portuguese for &quot;baby&quot;) because he was the youngest in both his family and his group of childhood friends. Like most Brazilian children, he played soccer from an early age; due to his skills, he was invited to train with pro clubs. In the mid-1990s, he started playing basketball at Escola de Basquete Meneghelli in his hometown. He later played professionally for Vasco da Gama from 1999 to 2002. In 2001, he joined the Brazilian national team and participated in the Goodwill Games.

==Professional career==

===Denver Nuggets (2002–2012)===
Nenê&#x27;s successful three-year stint playing in Brazil earned him an NBA pre-draft camp invitation in Chicago in 2002. He was later selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the New York Knicks, who traded him to the Denver Nuggets. He was the first Brazilian ever to be selected in the first round of the NBA draft.

Nenê began the 2002–03 season as a bench player, but ended it as a starter, averaging 10.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.6 steals. He ranked sixth in the NBA in field goal percentage (.519) and 20th in steals. He subsequently earned NBA All-Rookie first team honors.

In his second season, Nenê played and started in 77 games, averaging 11.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.5 steals in 32.5 minutes per games. He ranked fourth in the NBA in field goal percentage (.530).

In his third season, Nenê missed 27 games – 13 games due to a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, two games due to a right hip contusion, eight games due to a strained left hamstring, and four games due to an NBA suspension. He consequently played 55 games in 2004–05, averaging 9.6 points and 5.9 rebounds in 23.9 minutes per game.

In 2005–06, Nenê missed 81 games after suffering a torn ACL in his right knee after just three minutes of action against the San Antonio Spurs in the Denver&#x27;s season opening game on November 1.

After re-signing with the Nuggets to a six-year, $60 million contract on July 20, 2006, Nenê returned to action in 2006–07, averaging 12.2 points and 7.0 rebounds in 64 games (42 starts).

In 2007–08, Nenê played in just 16 games, averaging 5.3 points and 5.4 rebounds in 16.6 minutes per game. He suffered a torn ulner collateral ligament in his left thumb against the Boston Celtics on November 7 and missed the next 22 games.

On January 11, 2008, Nenê released a statement saying that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Denver Nuggets to address a medical issue. Three days later, he had a malignant testicular tumor removed at a Denver hospital. His right testicle was removed as well. He returned to action on March 27, 2008, in the Nuggets&#x27; 118–105 home win over the Dallas Mavericks. Nenê entered the game with 1:17 left in the fourth quarter to a standing ovation.

Nenê missed 37 games between January 11 and March 24, 2008, after his bout with testicular cancer. A right groin strain also forced him to miss the final six games of the season.

In response to his poor run of injuries and missed time, Nenê had a career-best year in 2008–09. He appeared in 77 games (76 starts) and averaged career-highs of 14.6 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.31 blocks, in addition to 1.23 steals in 32.6 minutes per game. He subsequently finished fifth in voting for the 2008–09 NBA Most Improved Player award. He also ranked second in the NBA in field goal percentage (.604 – 428-of-709), the best single-season mark in Nuggets&#x27; franchise history.

In 2009–10, Nenê played and started all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 13.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, a career-high 2.5 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.0 blocks in a career-high 33.6 minutes per game.
In 2010–11, Nenê appeared in 75 games (starting all 75), averaging 14.5 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.12 steals while shooting an NBA-leading .615 from the field in 30.5 minutes per game.

On December 14, 2011, Nenê re-signed with the Nuggets to a five-year, $67 million contract.

===Washington Wizards (2012–2016)===
On March 15, 2012, Nenê was traded to the Washington Wizards in a three-way trade involving the Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers. He averaged 13.7 points and 7.5 rebounds in 39 total games (33 starts) with Washington and Denver during the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season.

In 2012–13, Nenê averaged 12.6 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 27.2 minutes per game in 61 games (49 starts). On January 21, 2013, he scored a season-high 24 points in a 98–95 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

On November 26, 2013, Nenê scored a career-high 30 points in a 116–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Later that season, on February 22, Nenê matched that career-high in a 94–93 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.

In 2014–15, various injuries and ailments limited Nenê&#x27;s ability to produce at an optimum level, though he appeared in the most games (67) in five years. Towards the end of the season, when Nenê was relegated to more a supporting role to Marcin Gortat, he was a better rebounder and did more of the dirty work required. He averaged 11.0 points and 5.1 rebounds on 51.1% shooting during the season.

Nenê appeared in 12 of team&#x27;s first 13 games to begin the 2015–16 season, but between November 28 and January 3, he missed 19 straight games with a strained left calf. On March 14, 2016, he scored a season-high 20 points off the bench in a 124–81 win over the Detroit Pistons, Washington&#x27;s largest victory since the 2002–03 season.

===Houston Rockets (2016–2020)===

On July 20, 2016, Nenê signed with the Houston Rockets. He made his debut for the Rockets in their season opener on October 26, 2016, scoring seven points off the bench in a 120–114 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On January 5, 2017, he scored a season-high 18 points for his 12th double-digit game of the season in a 118–116 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. On April 23, 2017, he scored a playoff career-high 28 points on a perfect 12-of-12 shooting from the field to help the Rockets go up 3–1 in the team&#x27;s first-round playoff series against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On May 8, 2017, Nenê was ruled out for the remainder of the postseason with a left adductor tear. He suffered the injury the previous day in Game 4 of the Rockets&#x27; second-round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs.

On July 6, 2017, Nenê re-signed with the Rockets. On December 16, 2017, he scored a season-high 16 points in a 115–111 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

Nenê missed the first 21 games of the 2018–19 season with a strained right calf. Nenê&#x27;s final NBA game was Game 6 of the 2019 Western Conference Semifinals against the Golden State Warriors on May 10, 2019. In his final game, Nenê recorded 2 points, 2 rebounds, 1 assist and 1 block. He declined his $3.8 million player option, thus making him a free agent.

On September 3, 2019, Nenê re-signed with the Rockets. Most of his 2019-20 salary was non-guaranteed in the form of a likely bonus. The NBA suspected cap circumvention and ruled that Nenê&#x27;s salary value in a trade would only be the guaranteed $2.6 million and not the full value of $10 million.

Due to a lingering hip injury, Nenê was unable to play in a single game for the Rockets in 2019–20. On February 5, 2020, Nenê was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in a four-team, 12-player trade. The following day, Nenê was waived by the Hawks.

==National team career==
Nenê has been a member of the senior Brazilian national basketball team. With Brazil, he played at the following major tournaments: the 2001 FIBA AmeriCup, the 2003 FIBA AmeriCup, the 2007 FIBA AmeriCup, the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 2014 FIBA World Cup, and the 2016 Summer Olympics. He won the silver medal at the 2001 FIBA AmeriCup.

==Personal life==
On January 14, 2008, Nenê had a malignant testicular tumor removed. His right testicle was removed as well. In the years after his cancer scare, Nenê, a Christian, said God used cancer to test him and prepare him for helping others. Upon retiring from basketball, Nenê plans to become involved with church activities in Brazil.

Nenê has three sons with ex-wife Lauren Prothe.
He is currently married to Briley Sheppard Hilario.

<doc id="399452" wikidata="Q1531322" url="?curid=399452" title="Limb–girdle muscular dystrophy">
<text>Limb–girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a genetically heterogeneous group of rare muscular dystrophies that share a set of clinical characteristics. It is characterised by progressive muscle wasting which affects predominantly hip and shoulder muscles. LGMD usually has an autosomal pattern of inheritance. It currently has no known cure or treatment.

LGMD may be triggered or worsened in genetically susceptible individuals by statins, because of their effects on HMG-CoA reductase.

==Signs and symptoms==
By definition, all limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) cause progressive proximal weakness, meaning weakness of the muscles on or close to the torso that worsens over time. Explicitly, LGMD preferentially affects muscles of the hip girdle, thigh, shoulder girdle, and/or upper arm. The muscle weakness is generally symmetric. Usually, the hip girdle is the first area to exhibit weakness, manifesting as difficulty walking, going up and/or downstairs, rising from a chair, bending at the waist, or squatting. Because of these difficulties, falling can occur frequently. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can make lifting objects, or even elevating the arms, difficult or impossible. The rate of progression varies between patients. Eventually, the ability to run and walk can deteriorate. The disease commonly leads to dependence on a wheelchair within years of symptom onset, although some patients maintain mobility. Eventually the disease can affect other muscles such as the ones located in the face.

By definition, LGMDs primarily affect skeletal muscles, although cardiac muscle can be affected to a lesser degree in select subtypes, which can cause palpitations.

There can be significant variability in disease features and severity between LGMD subtypes, and even within any given LGMD subtype. Additional possible presentations include:
* Pseudoathletic appearance (muscle hypertrophy and/or pseudohypertrophy)
* Respiratory muscle problems
* Low back discomfort
* Distal muscle problems
* Secondary muscular mitochondrial impairment

== Genetics ==

LGMD is a genetic and heritable disorder, due to one of many genetic mutations of proteins involved in muscle function. All currently identified LGMDs have an inheritance pattern that is dominant or recessive, although the definition of LGMD allows for diseases with more complicated inheritance patterns to be classified as LGMD. Pathogenic mutations are mostly in coding regions, but non-coding causative variants were also reported.

In Euroasia CAPN3 mutations are the most common cause of LGMD, however in northern Europe mutations in FKRP are also very common. HMG CoA Reductase homozygous mutation leads to a form of LGMD that may respond to treatment with the downstream metabolite mevalonolactone in the cholesterol synthesis pathway.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can be done via muscle biopsy, which will show the presence of muscular dystrophy, and genetic testing is used to determine which type of muscular dystrophy a patient has. Immunohistochemical dystrophin tests can indicate a decrease in dystrophin detected in sarcoglycanopathies. In terms of sarcoglycan deficiency, there can be variance (if α-sarcoglycan and γ-sarcoglycan are not present then there&#x27;s a mutation in LGMD2D).

The 2014 &quot;Evidence-based guideline summary: Diagnosis and treatment of limb-girdle and distal dystrophies&quot; indicates that individuals suspected of having the inherited disorder should have genetic testing. Other tests/analysis are:
* High CK levels (10–150 times normal)
* MRI can indicate different types of LGMD.
* EMG can confirm the myopathic characteristic of the disease.
* Electrocardiography (cardiac arrhythmias in LGMD1B can occur)

===Types===

The &quot;LGMD D&quot; family is autosomal dominant, and the &quot;LGMD R&quot; family is autosomal recessive. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is explained in terms of the gene, locus, OMIM, and type as follows:

===LGMD criteria===
For a disease entity to be classified as an LGMD, the following criteria must be met:
* genetic, with an identifiable inheritance pattern such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, digenic, or polygenic.
* relatively selective to skeletal muscle
* predominantly proximal muscle involvement
* independent walking is achieved at one point in life
* elevated serum creatine kinase
* muscle fiber loss
* dystrophic changes in muscle histology
* degenerative changes on medical imaging
* end-stage pathology seen in the most affected muscles
* described in at least two unrelated families

===Differential===
Many diseases can manifest similarly to LGMD. Dystrophinopathies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and manifesting dystrophinopathy in female carriers, can present similarly to LGMD. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy can appear similarly, especially when it spares the facial muscles. Also in the differential are Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophies, Pompe disease, later-onset congenital myasthenic syndromes, and proximal-predominant hereditary motor neuropathies.

==Treatment==

Few studies corroborate the effectiveness of exercise for limb–girdle muscular dystrophy. However, studies have shown that exercise can, in fact, damage muscles permanently due to intense muscle contraction. Physical therapy may be required to maintain as much muscle strength and joint flexibility as possible. Calipers may be used to maintain mobility and quality of life. Careful attention to lung and heart health is required, corticosteroids in LGMD 2C-F individuals, show some improvement. Additionally individuals can follow &quot;management&quot; that follows:
* Occupational Therapy
* Respiratory Therapy
* Speech therapy
* Neutralizing antibody to myostatin should not be pursued

The sarcoglycanopathies could be possibly amenable to gene therapy.

==Prognosis==
In terms of the prognosis of limb–girdle muscular dystrophy in its mildest form, affected individuals have near-normal muscle strength and function. LGMD isn&#x27;t typically a fatal disease, though it may eventually weaken the heart and respiratory muscles, leading to illness or death due to secondary disorders.

==Epidemiology==
The minimum prevalence of limb–girdle muscular dystrophy, as a group, likely ranges from 2.27–10 per 100,000 (1:44,000 to 1:10,000). LGMD is the fourth most common muscular dystrophy, after the dystrophinopathies, myotonic dystrophies, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The prevalence of individual LGMDs, as studied in the United States, in descending order, are those due to mutation of 1) calpain, 2) dysferlin, 3) collagen VI, 4) sarcoglycans, 5) anoctamin 5, and 6) fukutin-related protein. In Euroasia CAPN3 mutations are the most common cause of LGMD, however, in northern Europe mutations in FKRP are also very common. It is difficult to calculate the worldwide prevalence of even the most common LGMD types, due to the founder effect causing varying prevalence by region. The less common types are very rare, often only described is limited regions of the world.

==History==
The term &#x27;limb-girdle muscular dystrophy&#x27; was published in 1954, describing a group of heterogeneous conditions that clinicians noticed to be distinct from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. The genetics of LGMDs began to be understood in the late 1900s, which led the European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) to establish a consensus on the classification of LGMDs in 1995. The classification scheme at that time denoted autosomal dominant LGMDs as &#x27;LGMD1&#x27; and autosomal recessive LGMDs as &#x27;LGMD2.&#x27; A letter was appended to the names of LGMDs according to the order of discovery of the causal genetic mutation. As LGMD2Z was established, the question arose of what letter to assign the next discovered LGMD2. With this issue, among other motives, the ENMC established a new consensus on the classification and definition of LGMD in 2017. With the new definition, several diseases were removed from the LGMD category:

==Research==

There is a variety of research underway targeted at various forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Among the treatments thought to hold promise is gene therapy, which is the delivery of genetic material, often a copy of a healthy gene, into cells.

According to a review by Bengtsson et al., some success with AAV-mediated gene therapies (for different disorders) has increased interest in researchers, with CRISPR/Cas9 and exon-skipping helping these therapeutic goals along. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies have many different types which are due to different gene mutations. LGMD2D is caused by a mutation in the α-sarcoglycan gene. Future treatment could be had by gene therapy through recombinant adeno-associated vectors.

According to a review by Straub, et al., several research issues need to be addressed: the rareness of the disease, poor understanding of the mechanism of LGMD R, and absence of patient cohorts, all contributing to the lack of biomarkers for LGMD. The review states that animal models for LGMD R have been used to analyze therapeutic medications. Also, although prednisone has been used and has had positive effects on affected LGMD2 individuals, there is still no evidence of its effectiveness in trials that are placebo-controlled.

<text>William Earnest Harwell (January 25, 1918 – May 4, 2010) was an American sportscaster, known for his long career calling play-by-play of Major League Baseball games. For 55 seasons, 42 of them with the Detroit Tigers, Harwell broadcast the action on radio and/or television. In January 2009, the American Sportscasters Association ranked him 16th on its list of Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Ernie Harwell grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, working in his youth as a paperboy for &quot;The Atlanta Georgian&quot;; one of his customers was writer Margaret Mitchell. An avid baseball fan from an early age, Harwell became a visiting batboy for the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association at the age of five, and never had to buy a ticket to get into a baseball game again. At sixteen he began working as a regional correspondent for &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Harwell attended Emory University, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and helped edit &quot;The Emory Wheel&quot;. After graduating, Harwell worked as a copy editor and sportswriter for &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;. In 1943, he began announcing games for the Crackers on WSB radio, after which he served four years in the United States Marine Corps. Harwell would leave the service in January 1946
as a sergeant. During his enlistment he was stationed in Camp Lejeune as a writer for &quot;The Globe&quot;, and later in Washington, D.C. as a writer for &quot;Leatherneck&quot;.

===Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Orioles===
The Crackers were a Class AA team, two rungs below the majors. Nonetheless, Harwell had achieved considerable notoriety due to the Crackers airing their games on WSB, a 50,000-watt station that reached much of the eastern half of the United States at night. Brooklyn Dodgers general manager and part-owner Branch Rickey was impressed enough with Harwell that he believed he would be an appropriate substitute for longtime Dodgers announcer Red Barber, who was recuperating from a bleeding ulcer. He traded catcher Cliff Dapper to the Crackers in exchange for breaking Harwell&#x27;s broadcasting contract, the only known instance in baseball history where a player was traded for a broadcaster.

Harwell broadcast for the Dodgers through 1949, the New York Giants from 1950 to 1953, and the Baltimore Orioles from 1954 to 1959. Harwell was the lead broadcaster on Orioles broadcasts on WCBM-AM and WMAR-TV in 1955, working alongside Chuck Thompson. The next year Thompson moved on to Washington D.C. to broadcast the Senator games until returning to the Orioles in 1962. Early in Harwell&#x27;s career, he also broadcast The Masters golf tournament, as well as pro and college football.

===Detroit Tigers===

Harwell joined the Detroit Tigers&#x27; broadcast crew in 1960, replacing Van Patrick after the latter was dismissed owing to a sponsorship change. George Kell, who had begun calling Tigers games with Patrick the year before, and had previously played for the Orioles in 1956–57 while Harwell was announcing their games, was instrumental in bringing Harwell to Detroit. &quot;George called and said, &#x27;I recommended you and the Tigers asked me to get in touch with you.&#x27;&quot; Harwell said. &quot;I came and that was it.&quot;

Harwell shared TV and radio duties with Kell through 1963, then with Bob Scheffing in 1964. He began working radio exclusively in 1965, teaming with Gene Osborn for two seasons and then with Ray Lane from 1967 to 1972. Paul Carey replaced Lane in 1973, joining Harwell to form the Tigers&#x27; best-known and longest-lasting radio team, which lasted until the end of the 1991 season. Harwell gained a large following outside of Detroit because the Tigers aired their games on WJR, a 50,000-watt station that reached most of the eastern half of North America at night.

On December 19, 1990, the Tigers and WJR announced that the station wanted to go in a &quot;new direction&quot; and that the 1991 season would be Harwell&#x27;s last, as his contract was &quot;non-renewed&quot;. Carey then announced that he had already planned to retire after the 1991 season and that the decision was unrelated to Harwell&#x27;s contract situation. Fans across Michigan and throughout the baseball world were outraged, but the ballclub and the radio station (who eventually wound up blaming each other for the decision) stood firm: &quot;[Harwell&#x27;s situation is] not going to change no matter how much clamor is made over it,&quot; said team president Bo Schembechler. The situation caused outrage so much that some made threats of violence against Schembechler. Some, such as Mitch Albom, blamed the situation for causing as much negative feeling as it did on WJR executive Jim Long who was the one who pushed the quick, no severance pay removal of Harwell. The movement in favor of keeping Harwell was so strong that even billboards in favor of his remaining were put up. Rick Rizzs was hired away from the Seattle Mariners to replace Harwell in 1992, teaming with Bob Rathbun.

Harwell worked a part-time schedule for the California Angels in 1992. The following year, the Tigers were purchased by Mike Ilitch, who made it one of his priorities to bring Harwell back. In 1993 Harwell teamed with Rizzs and Rathbun on the WJR broadcasts, calling play-by-play of the middle innings in each game. From 1994 to 1998, Harwell called television broadcasts for the Tigers on PASS Sports, WKBD-TV, and later Fox Sports Detroit (now FanDuel Sports Network Detroit) for select broadcasts. In 1999, he resumed full-time radio duties with the team, swapping roles with Frank Beckmann (who had replaced Rizzs in the radio booth following the 1994 season), teaming with analyst Jim Price, and continuing in that role even as the team&#x27;s radio rights changed from WJR to WXYT in 2001. During spring training in 2002, he announced that he would retire at the end of the season; his final broadcast came on September 29, 2002. Dan Dickerson, who had joined Harwell and Price in 2000, took over as the Tigers&#x27; lead radio voice the following year.

===National broadcast work===
Harwell&#x27;s broadcast for the Giants of the third and final game of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series against the Dodgers, which ended with the pennant-clinching &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; home run by the Giants&#x27; Bobby Thompson, was carried nationally on NBC television.

Harwell helped broadcast two All-Star Games (, ) and two World Series (1963, 1968) for NBC Radio, numerous ALCS and ALDS for CBS Radio and ESPN Radio, and the CBS Radio &quot;Game of the Week&quot; from 1992 to 1997. He also called the 1984 World Series locally for the Tigers and WJR. For CBS TV&#x27;s coverage of the 1991 World Series, Harwell narrated an opening prologue prior to Game 1 and a closing epilogue (an excerpt from A. Bartlett Giamatti&#x27;s &quot;The Green Fields of the Mind&quot;) after Game 7.

===Post-retirement broadcasting works===
Following his retirement, Harwell came back briefly in 2003 to call a &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot; telecast on ESPN, as part of that network&#x27;s &quot;Living Legends&quot; series of guest announcers. In 2005, Harwell guested for an inning on the Fox network&#x27;s coverage of the All-Star Game (which was held in Detroit for the first time since 1971), as well as an inning on the ESPN Radio broadcast. For Game 3 of the 2006 American League Division Series between the Tigers and New York Yankees, he provided guest commentary on ESPN&#x27;s telecast for two innings, called an inning of play-by-play on the Tigers&#x27; radio flagship WXYT, and guested for an inning on ESPN Radio. Harwell also called an inning of Game 1 of the 2006 World Series for WXYT.

Harwell served as a guest color commentator for two Tiger games on FSN Detroit on May 24 and 25, 2007. Harwell worked the telecasts (alongside play-by-play man Mario Impemba) as a substitute for regular analyst Rod Allen, who took the games off to attend his son&#x27;s high school graduation. (Harwell had filled in for Allen once before, on a 2003 telecast.)

He also appeared as a guest on an ESPN &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; telecast in Detroit on July 1, 2007.

Harwell occasionally did vignettes on the history of baseball for Fox Sports Detroit&#x27;s magazine program &quot;Tigers Weekly&quot;.

==Broadcasting style==
Harwell was known for his low-key delivery, southern accent (Detroit &quot;Ti-guhs&quot;), and conversational style. Some of his trademark phrases were:
* &quot;That one is &quot;long&quot; gone!&quot; (His trademark home run call, with an emphasis on &quot;long&quot;)
* &quot;He stood there like the house by the side of the road, and watched it go by.&quot; (After a called strikeout)
* &quot;Called out for excessive window shopping.&quot; (Also after a called strikeout)
* &quot;It&#x27;s two for the price of one!&quot; (After a double play)
* &quot;A fan from [insert a city] will be taking that ball home today.&quot; (When a fan would catch a foul ball)
* &quot;The Tigers need instant runs.&quot; (When the team was behind in the late innings)

Harwell would also begin the first spring training broadcast of each season with a reading from Song of Solomon 2:11-12 (KJV): &quot;For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.&quot;

==Non-broadcast activities==
Harwell&#x27;s 1955 essay &quot;The Game for All America&quot;, originally published in &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and reprinted numerous times, is considered a classic of baseball literature. He also authored several books, including &quot;Life After Baseball&quot;, &quot;Tuned to Baseball&quot;, and &quot;Breaking 90: Nine Decades Young and Still Loving Baseball&quot;. He was an occasional columnist for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;.

Harwell also wrote popular music. His first recorded song was &quot;Upside Down&quot; on the &quot;Something Stupid&quot; album by Homer and Jethro in the mid-1960s. In the liner notes of the album, it says: &quot;Detroit Tiger baseball announcer wrote this one, and we think it&#x27;s a fine observation of the world today, as seen from the press box at Tiger Stadium. We were up there with Ernie one day and from there the world looks upside down. The Mets were on top in the National League.&quot; All told, 66 songs written by Ernie Harwell have been recorded by various artists. &quot;Needless to say, I have more no-hitters than Nolan Ryan.&quot; – Ernie Harwell in an article published May 31, 2005, in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;

Harwell made a cameo appearance in the 1994 film &quot;Cobb&quot; and in the made-for-television movies &quot;Aunt Mary&quot; (1979), &quot;Tiger Town&quot; (1983), and &quot;Cooperstown&quot; (1993). His voice can be briefly heard in the films &quot;Paper Lion&quot; (1968) and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975) and in the TV movie &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; (2004). Harwell appeared as an interview subject in the 1998 documentary film &quot;The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg&quot; and contributed to numerous other baseball-themed documentaries and retrospectives over the years.

The 1997 text-based computer simulation game &quot;APBA for Windows: Broadcast Blast&quot; features play-by-play commentary by Harwell.

Harwell served as a spokesman for Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Michigan. His contract with the organization, which began in 2003, ran for ten years with an option for another ten. Had Harwell fulfilled the entire contract (by which time he would have been 95 years old), Blue Cross had pledged to extend it for yet another decade. Harwell formerly ran a blog about healthy living and fitness for BCBS. He retired from it on March 5, 2009.

A devout Christian (he was born again at a 1961 Billy Graham crusade), Harwell was long involved with Baseball Chapel, an evangelistic organization for professional ballplayers.

In 2004, the Detroit Public Library dedicated a room to Ernie Harwell and his wife, Lulu, which will house Harwell&#x27;s collection of baseball memorabilia valued at over two million dollars.

On April 26, 2008, Harwell was presented with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from The University of Michigan at their Spring Commencement ceremony. One week later, on May 3, 2008, he was presented with another Honorary Degree of Laws this time from Wayne State University.

In late 2008, Harwell began to appear in television public service announcements for the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, advising viewers about the Digital television transition in the United States.

Harwell was a member of the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy Board, an organization that attempted to save portions of Tiger Stadium. He offered to donate a large portion of his historic collection of baseball memorabilia, which he had collected over the course of his storied career, if part of Tiger Stadium could have been saved for a museum.

Harwell lived in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and moved to Novi in the late 1990s, where he lived until his death. Up until just before his death, he still exercised regularly, did sit-ups, used a treadmill, and lifted weights.

==Awards and honors==

The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Harwell as Michigan Sportscaster of the Year 19 times, and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1991, Harwell was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame. Harwell was also honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981 as the fifth broadcaster to receive its Ford C. Frick Award, and was elected to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1998, among many other honors. In 2001, Harwell was the recipient of the prestigious Ty Tyson Award for Excellence in Sports Broadcasting, awarded by the Detroit Sports Media Association (DSMA). In 2009, Harwell was named the first recipient of the DSMA&#x27;s Ernie Harwell Lifetime Contribution Award (the &quot;Ernie&quot;.) The award honor individuals from sports media who have contributed outstanding time and effort to the betterment of sports broadcasting through a lifetime body of work. He was named a Lifetime Member of the Detroit Sports Media Association. Emory University inducted Harwell to its Hall of Fame in 1990. The Georgia Sports Hall of Fame inducted Harwell in 2008. In 2010 Harwell was named as a recipient of the Vin Scully Lifetime Achievement Award from Fordham University radio station WFUV. The press box at Detroit&#x27;s Comerica Park was officially named the &quot;Ernie Harwell Media Center&quot; following his retirement from broadcasting. The Cleveland Indians also named their visiting radio booth at Progressive Field after Harwell. The site of Tiger Stadium at one time had a sign on the fence as &quot;Ernie Harwell Park&quot;, but it is not currently or officially a city park.

===Harwell Field===
On June 6, 2013, the Wayne State University Department of Athletics in conjunction with the Ernie Harwell Estate and the Ernie Harwell Foundation announced the establishment of the Harwell Field Project.

This project is an outreach effort that built a baseball stadium in recognition of Ernie and his wife of 62 years, Lula &quot;Lulu&quot; Harwell. Harwell Field has grandstands, press box, team clubhouse and a foyer to recognize the achievements and contributions of the Harwells.

==Illness and death==

On September 3, 2009, Harwell announced that he had been diagnosed with incurable bile duct cancer, and that he, his family and doctors had decided against surgery or other treatment of the condition. On September 16, Harwell gave a farewell address to fans at Comerica Park between innings of a game between the Tigers and the Kansas City Royals.

Harwell sat down for a 60-minute interview on an episode of MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Studio 42 with Bob Costas&quot;, his final television appearance. The episode premiered November 17, 2009. In the interview, Costas correctly foresaw the 2009 World Series would unfortunately be Harwell&#x27;s last.

Harwell died on May 4, 2010, at his home in Novi, Michigan, surrounded by his wife of 68 years, Lulu, and three of their four children.

He was set to receive the Vin Scully Lifetime Achievement Award in Sports Broadcasting on May 5 in New York City. Harwell considered Scully to be the best broadcaster of all time. However, in accepting the award on Harwell&#x27;s behalf, Al Kaline noted &quot;We Tiger fans respectfully disagree.&quot;

Harwell lay in repose at Comerica Park on May 6. Over 10,000 fans filed past the open casket. May 10 was declared Ernie Harwell Day at Comerica Park. Several players and broadcasters hoisted a flag in center field bearing his initials, similar to the ones that were also sewn onto all Tigers uniforms. Harwell&#x27;s longtime broadcasting partner Paul Carey threw out the ceremonial first pitch that night.

<text>In psychology, trait theory (also called dispositional theory) is an approach to the study of human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of &quot;traits&quot;, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. According to this perspective, traits are aspects of personality that are relatively stable over time, differ across individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are not), are relatively consistent over situations, and influence behaviour. Traits are in contrast to states, which are more transitory dispositions. Traits such as extraversion vs. introversion are measured on a spectrum, with each person placed somewhere along it.

Trait theory suggests that some natural behaviours may give someone an advantage in a position of leadership.

There are two approaches to define traits: as internal causal properties or as purely descriptive summaries. The internal causal definition states that traits influence our behaviours, leading us to do things in line with that trait. On the other hand, traits as descriptive summaries are descriptions of our actions that do not try to infer causality.

==History==
American psychologist Gordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of traits. This early work was viewed as the beginning of the modern psychological study of personality. He also referred to traits within his work as dispositions. In his approach, &quot;cardinal&quot; traits are those that dominate and shape a person&#x27;s behavior; their ruling passions/obsessions, such as a need for money, fame etc. By contrast, &quot;central&quot; traits such as honesty are characteristics found in some degree in every person – and finally &quot;secondary&quot; traits are those seen only in certain circumstances (such as particular likes or dislikes that a very close friend may know), which are included to provide a complete picture of human complexity.

A wide variety of alternative theories and scales were later developed, including:
* Raymond Cattell&#x27;s 16PF Questionnaire
* J. P. Guilford&#x27;s Structure of Intellect 
* Henry Murray&#x27;s System of Needs
* Timothy Leary&#x27;s Interpersonal circumplex
* Myers–Briggs Type Indicator
* Gray&#x27;s Biopsychological theory of personality

Currently, two general approaches are the most popular:

* Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, (EPQ) (&quot;the three-factor model&quot;). Using factor analysis Hans Eysenck suggested that personality is reducible to three major traits: neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism. 
* Big Five personality traits, (&quot;the five-factor model&quot;). Many psychologists currently believe that five factors are sufficient: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.

== Trait theory in cross-cultural use ==
Cultures are widely known and accepted as being different in varying degrees. This can make the study of personality difficult as meaning and the expression of traits may be different within cultural groups. Trait theory uses a hierarchy of traits in order to separate culture from the traits; it can be said the culture is ignored in order to focus on the individual traits and how they are connected to the individual. Gordon Allport&#x27;s trait theory not only served as a foundational approach within personality psychology, but also is continued to be viewed and discussed by other disciplines such as anthropology because of how he approached culture within trait theory.

Trait theory tends to focus on the individual over the situation in which they are in. This focus has relaxed within modern studies allowing for a consideration of the external factors outside of the self. As the focus becomes more relaxed (but still prominent as it is a main part of the theory) research expands.

==Comparing EPQ and Big Five==

===Testing methodology, and factors===
Both the EPQ and Big Five approaches extensively use self-report questionnaires. The factors are intended to be orthogonal (uncorrelated), though there are often small positive correlations between factors. The five factor model in particular has been criticized for losing the orthogonal structure between factors. British psychologist Hans Eysenck has argued that fewer factors are superior to a larger number of partly related ones. Although these two approaches are comparable because of the use of factor analysis to construct hierarchical taxonomies, they differ in the organization and number of factors.

Whatever the causes, psychoticism marks the two approaches apart, as the five factor model contains no such trait. Moreover, psychoticism, unlike any of the other factors in either approach, does not fit a normal distribution curve. Indeed, scores are rarely high, thus skewing a normal distribution. However, when they are high, there is considerable overlap with psychiatric conditions such as antisocial and schizoid personality disorders. Similarly, high scorers on neuroticism are more susceptible to sleep and psychosomatic disorders. Five factor approaches can also predict future mental disorders.

=== Lower-order factors ===
There are two higher-order factors that both taxonomies clearly share: extraversion and neuroticism. Both approaches broadly accept that extraversion is associated with sociability and positive affect, whereas neuroticism is associated with emotional instability and negative affect.

Many lower-order factors, or facets, are similar between the two taxonomies. For instance, both approaches contain factors for sociability/gregariousness, for activity levels, and for assertiveness within the higher order factor extraversion. However, there are differences too. First, the three-factor approach contains nine lower-order factors and the five-factor approach has six.

Eysenck&#x27;s psychoticism factor incorporates some of the polar opposites of the lower order factors of openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. A high scorer on tough-mindedness in psychoticism would score low on tender-mindedness in agreeableness. Most of the differences between the taxonomies stem from the three factor model&#x27;s emphasis on fewer high-order factors.

===Causality===
Although both major trait models are descriptive, only the three-factor model offers a detailed causal explanation. Eysenck suggests that different personality traits are caused by the properties of the brain, which themselves are the result of genetic factors. In particular, the three-factor model identifies the reticular system and the limbic system in the brain as key components that mediate cortical arousal and emotional responses respectively. Eysenck advocates that extraverts have low levels of cortical arousal and introverts have high levels, leading extraverts to seek out more stimulation from socializing and being venturesome. Moreover, Eysenck surmised that there would be an optimal level of arousal, after which inhibition would occur and that this would be different for each person.

In a similar vein, the three-factor approach theorizes that neuroticism is mediated by levels of arousal in the limbic system and that individual differences arise because of variable activation thresholds between people. Therefore, highly neurotic people when presented with minor stressors, will exceed this threshold, whereas people low in neuroticism will not exceed normal activation levels, even when presented with large stressors. By contrast, proponents of the five-factor approach assume a role of genetics and environment but offer no explicit causal explanation.

Given this emphasis on biology in the three-factor approach, it would be expected that the third trait, psychoticism, would have a similar explanation. However, the causal properties of this state are not well defined. Eysenck has suggested that psychoticism is related to testosterone levels and is an inverse function of the serotonergic system, but he later revised this, linking it instead to the dopaminergic system.

==List of personality traits==
After examining thousands of personality measures and numerous personality trait frameworks, researchers have created &quot;super-frameworks&quot; that aim to encapsulate all personality traits into a single model (e.g., Pan-Hierarchical Five Factor Model). These models also sometimes identify measures that can be used to measure traits/constructs in the models.

<doc id="399463" wikidata="Q283127" url="?curid=399463" title="Oracle bone">
<text>Oracle bones are pieces of ox scapula and turtle plastron which were used in pyromancya form of divinationduring the Late Shang period () in ancient China. &quot;Scapulimancy&quot; is the specific term if ox scapulae were used for the divination, &quot;plastromancy&quot; if turtle plastrons were used. A recent count estimated that there were about 13,000 bones with a total of a little over 130,000 inscriptions in collections in China and some fourteen other countries.

Diviners would submit questions to deities regarding weather, crop planting, the fortunes of members of the royal family, military endeavors, and similar topics. These questions were carved onto the bone or shell in oracle bone script using a sharp tool. Intense heat was then applied with a metal rod until the bone or shell cracked due to thermal expansion. The diviner would then interpret the pattern of cracks and write the prognostication upon the piece as well. Pyromancy with bones continued in China into the Zhou dynasty, but the questions and prognostications were increasingly written with brushes and cinnabar ink, which degraded over time.

Oracle bones bear the earliest known significant corpus of ancient Chinese writing, using an early form of Chinese characters. The inscriptions contain around 5,000 different characters, many of which are still being used today, though the total number of discrete characters is uncertain as some may be different versions of the same character. Specialists have agreed on the form, meanings, and sound of a little more than a quarter of the characters, roughly 1,200 with certainty, but several hundred more remain under discussion; these known characters comprise much of the core vocabulary of modern Chinese. They provide important information on the late Shang period, and scholars have reconstructed the Shang royal genealogy from the cycle of ancestral sacrifices recorded on oracle bones. When they were discovered at the end of the nineteenth century and deciphered in the early twentieth century, these records confirmed the existence of the Shang, whose historicity had been subject to scrutiny at the time by the Doubting Antiquity School.

Oraculology is the discipline for the study of oracle bones and the oracle bone script.

==Discovery==

Shang-era oracle bones are thought to have been unearthed occasionally by local farmers since as early as the Sui and Tang dynasties, and perhaps starting as early as the Han dynasty. In Sui and Tang era Anyang, which was at one time the capital of the Shang dynasty, oracle bones were exhumed during burial ceremonies, though grave diggers did not realize what the bones were and generally reinterred them. During the 19th century, villagers in the area who were digging in the fields discovered a number of bones, and used them as dragon bones, following the traditional Chinese medicine practice of grinding up Pleistocene fossils into tonics or poultices. The turtle shell fragments were prescribed for malaria, while the other animal bones were used in powdered form to treat knife wounds.

In 1899, an antiques dealer from Shandong who was searching for Chinese bronzes in the area acquired a number of oracle bones from locals, and later sold several to Wang Yirong, the chancellor of the Imperial Academy in Beijing. Wang was a knowledgeable collector of Chinese bronzes, and is believed to be the first person in modern times to recognize the oracle bones&#x27; markings as ancient Chinese writing similar to that on Zhou dynasty bronzes. A legendary tale relates that Wang was sick with malaria, and his scholar friend Liu E was visiting him and helped examine his medicine. They discovered that, before being ground into powder, the bones bore strange glyphs which, having studied the ancient bronze inscriptions, they recognized as ancient writing. Xu Yahui states that, &quot;[n]o one can know how many oracle bones, prior to 1899, were ground up by traditional Chinese pharmacies and disappeared into people&#x27;s stomachs.&quot;

It is not known how Wang and Liu actually came across these specimens, but Wang is credited with being the first to recognize their significance. During the Boxer Rebellion, Wang reluctantly accepted a defense command, and killed himself in 1900 when allied troops entered Beijing. His son later sold the bones to Liu, who published the first book of rubbings of the oracle bone inscriptions in 1903. As news of the oracle bones&#x27; discovery spread throughout China and among foreign collectors and scholars the market for the bones exploded, though many collectors sought to keep the location of the bones&#x27; source a secret. Although scholars tried to find their source, antique dealers falsely claimed that the bones came from Tangyin in Henan. In 1908, scholar Luo Zhenyu discovered the source of the bones near Anyang and realized that the area was the site of the last Shang dynasty capital.

Decades of uncontrolled digs followed to fuel the antiques trade, and many of these pieces eventually entered collections in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Japan. The first Western collector was the American missionary Frank H. Chalfant (1862–1914). Chalfant also coined the term &quot;oracle bone&quot; in his 1906 book &quot;Early Chinese Writing&quot;, which was then calqued into Chinese as in the 1930s.

Only a small number of dealers and collectors knew the location of the source of the oracle bones until they were found by Canadian missionary James Mellon Menzies, the first person to scientifically excavate, study, and decipher them. He was the first to conclude that the bones were records of divination from the Shang dynasty, and was the first to come up with a method of dating them (in order to avoid being fooled by fakes). In 1917 he published the first scientific study of the bones, including 2,369 drawings and inscriptions and thousands of ink rubbings. Through the donation of local people and his own archaeological excavations, he acquired the largest private collection in the world, over 35,000 pieces. He insisted that his collection remain in China, though some were sent to Canada by colleagues who were worried that they would be either destroyed or stolen during the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. The Chinese still acknowledge the pioneering contribution of Menzies as &quot;the foremost western scholar of Yin-Shang culture and oracle bone inscriptions&quot;. His former residence in Anyang was declared a &quot;Protected Treasure&quot; in 2004, and the James Mellon Menzies Memorial Museum for Oracle Bone Studies was established.

== Official excavations ==

By the time of the establishment of the Institute of History and Philology by Fu Sinian at the Academia Sinica in 1928, the source of the oracle bones had been traced back to modern Xiaotun () village at Anyang in Henan. Official archaeological excavations led by Li Ji, the father of Chinese archaeology, between 1928 and 1937 discovered 20,000 oracle bone pieces, which now form the bulk of the Academia Sinica&#x27;s collection in Taiwan and constitute about 1/5 of the total discovered. The major archaeologically excavated pits of bones have been:
* Pit YH127 in Xiaotun North (1936), with over 17,000 inscribed pieces.
* Xiaotun South (1977–1979), with 4,612 inscribed pieces.
* Huayuangzhuang East (1991), with 561 inscribed pieces.

When deciphered, the inscriptions on the oracle bones were revealed to be records of the divinations performed for or by the royal household. These, together with royal-sized tombs, proved beyond a doubt for the first time the existence of the Shang dynasty, which had recently been doubted, and the location of its last capital, Yin. Today, Xiaotun at Anyang is thus also known as the Ruins of Yin, or Yinxu.

== Publication ==
Oracle bone inscriptions were published as they were discovered, in fascicles. Subsequently, many collections of inscriptions were also published. The following are the main collections.

Observing that the citation of these different works was becoming unwieldy, historians Hu Houxuan and Guo Moruo began an effort to comprehensively publish all bones discovered by the mid-1950s. The result, the &quot;Jiaguwen Heji&quot; (1978–1982) was edited by Houxuan and Guo Moruo and, with its supplement (1999) edited by Peng Bangjiong, is the most comprehensive catalogue of the oracle bone fragments. The 20 volumes contain reproductions of over 55,000 fragments. A separate work published in 1999 contains transcriptions of the inscriptions into standard characters.

==Dating==

The vast majority of the inscribed oracle bones were found at the Yinxu site in modern Anyang and date to the reigns of the last nine Shang kings. The diviners named on the bones have been assigned to five periods by Dong Zuobin:

The kings were involved in divination in all periods, with divinations in later periods done personally by the king. The extant inscriptions are not evenly distributed across these periods, with 55% coming from period I and 31% from periods III and IV. A few oracle bones date to the beginning of the subsequent Zhou dynasty.

The earliest oracle bones (corresponding to the reigns of Wu Ding and Zu Geng) record dates using only the 60-day cycle of stems and branches, though sometimes the month was also given. Attempts to determine an absolute chronology focus on a number of lunar eclipses recorded in inscriptions by the Bīn group, who worked during the reign of Wu Ding, possibly extending into the reign of Zu Geng. Assuming that the 60-day cycle continued uninterrupted into the securely dated period, scholars have sought to match the recorded dates with calculated dates of eclipses. There is general agreement on four of these, spanning dates from 1198 to 1180 BCE. A fifth is assigned by some scholars to 1201 BCE. From this data, the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project, relying on the statement in the &quot;Against Luxurious Ease&quot; chapter of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; that the reign of Wu Ding lasted 59 years, dated it from 1250 to 1192 BCE. American sinologist David Keightley argued that the &quot;Against Luxurious Ease&quot; chapter should not be treated as a historical text because it was composed much later, presents reign lengths as moral judgements, and gives other reign lengths that are contradicted by oracle bone evidence. Estimating an average reign length of 20 years based on dated Zhou reigns, Keightley proposed that Wu Ding&#x27;s reign started around 1200  BCE or earlier. Ken-ichi Takashima dates the earliest oracle bone inscriptions to 1230 BCE. 26 oracle bones throughout Wu Ding&#x27;s reign have been radiocarbon dated to 1254–1197 BCE (±10 years) with an estimated 80-90% probability of containing the true individual ages.

Period V inscriptions often identify numbered ritual cycles, making it easier to estimate the reign lengths of the last two kings. The start of this period is dated 1100–1090 BCE by Keightley and 1101 BCE by the Xia–Shang–Zhou project. Most scholars now agree that the Zhou conquest of the Shang took place close to 1046 or 1045 BCE, over a century later than the traditional date.

==Shang divination==
Since divination was by heat or fire and most often on plastrons or scapulae, the terms &quot;pyromancy&quot;, &quot;plastromancy&quot; and &quot;scapulimancy&quot; are often used for this process.

===Materials===

The oracle bones are mostly turtle plastrons, probably female and ox scapulae, although there are also examples of tortoise carapaces, ox rib bones, the scapulae of sheep, boars, horses, and deer, and other various animal bones. The skulls of deer, oxen, and humans have also been found with inscriptions on them, although these are very rare and appear to have been inscribed for record keeping or practice rather than for actual divination; in one case, inscribed deer antlers were reported, but Keightley reports that they are fake. Interestingly, tortoises are not native to the areas oracle bones were discovered and thus it is theorized they were presented to the region as tribute. Neolithic diviners in China had long been heating the bones of deer, sheep, pigs, and cattle for similar purposes; evidence for this in Liaoning has been found dating to the late fourth millennium BCE. However, over time, the use of ox bones increased, and use of tortoise shells does not appear until early Shang culture. The earliest tortoise shells found that had been prepared for divinatory use (i.e., with chiseled pits) date to the earliest Shang stratum at Erligang (modern Zhengzhou). By the end of the Erligang, the plastrons were numerous, and at Anyang, scapulae and plastrons were used in roughly equal numbers. Due to the use of these shells in addition to bones, early references to the oracle bone script often used the term &quot;shell and bone script&quot;, but since tortoise shells are actually a bony material, the more concise term &quot;oracle bones&quot; is applied to them as well.

The bones or shells were first sourced and then prepared for use. Their sourcing is significant because some of them (especially many of the shells) are believed to have been presented as tribute to the Shang, which provides valuable information about diplomatic relations of the time. We know this because notations were often made on them recording their provenance (e.g., tribute of how many shells from where and on what date). For example, one notation records that &quot; () sent 250 (tortoise shells)&quot;, identifying this as, perhaps, a statelet within the Shang sphere of influence. These notations were generally made on the back of the shell&#x27;s bridge (called bridge notations), the lower carapace, or the xiphiplastron (tail edge). Some shells may have been from locally raised tortoises, however. Scapula notations were near the socket or a lower edge. Some of these notations were not carved after being written with a brush, proving (along with other evidence) the use of the writing brush in Shang times. Scapulae are assumed to have generally come from the Shang&#x27;s own livestock, perhaps those used in ritual sacrifice, although there are records of cattle sent as tribute as well, including some recorded via marginal notations.

=== Preparation ===

The bones or shells were cleaned of meat and then prepared by sawing, scraping, smoothing, and even polishing to create flat surfaces. The predominance of scapulae, and later of plastrons, is also thought to be related to their ease of use as large, flat surfaces that needed minimal preparation. There is also speculation that only female tortoise shells were used, as these are significantly less concave. Pits or hollows were then drilled or chiseled partway through the bone or shell in an orderly series. At least one such drill has been unearthed at Erligang, exactly matching the pits in size and shape. The shape of these pits evolved over time, and is an important indicator for dating the oracle bones within various sub-periods in the Shang dynasty. The shape and depth also helped determine the nature of the crack that would appear. The number of pits per bone or shell varied widely.

=== Cracking and interpretation ===

Divinations were typically carried out for the Shang kings in the presence of a diviner. Very few oracle bones were used in divination by other members of the royal family or nobles close to the king. By the latest periods, the Shang kings took over the role of diviner personally.

During a divination session, the shell or bone was anointed with blood and, in an inscription section called the &quot;preface&quot;, the date was recorded using the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, along with the diviner&#x27;s name. Next, the topic of divination (called the &quot;charge&quot;) was posed, such as whether a particular ancestor was causing a king&#x27;s toothache. The divination charges were often directed at ancestors, whom the ancient Chinese revered and worshiped, as well as natural powers and (), the highest god in the Shang society. Anything of concern to the royal house of Shang served as possible topics for charges, from illness, birth and death, to weather, warfare, agriculture, tribute and so on. One of the most common topics was whether performing rituals in a certain manner would be satisfactory.

An intense heat source was then inserted in a pit until it cracked. Due to the shape of the pit, the front side of the bone cracked in a rough shape. The character ( or ; Old Chinese: ; &#x27;to divine&#x27;) may be a pictogram of such a crack; the reading of the character may also be an onomatopoeia for the cracking. A number of cracks were typically made in one session, sometimes on more than one bone, and these were typically numbered. The diviner in charge of the ceremony read the cracks to learn the answer to the divination. How exactly the cracks were interpreted is not known. The topic of divination was raised multiple times, and often in different ways, such as in the negative, or by changing the date being divined about. One oracle bone might be used for one session or for many, and one session could be recorded on a number of bones. The divined answer was sometimes then marked either &quot;auspicious&quot; or &quot;inauspicious&quot;, and the king occasionally added a &quot;prognostication&quot;, his reading on the nature of the omen. On very rare occasions, the actual outcome was later added to the bone in what is known as a &quot;verification&quot;. A complete record of all the above elements is rare; most bones contain just the date, diviner and topic of divination, and many remained uninscribed after the divination.

The uninscribed divination is thought to have been brush-written with ink or cinnabar on the oracle bones or accompanying documents, as a few of the oracle bones found still bear their brush-written divinations without carving, while some have been found partially carved. After use, shells and bones used ritually were buried in separate pits (some for shells only; others for scapulae only), in groups of up to hundreds or even thousands (one pit unearthed in 1936 contained over 17,000 pieces along with a human skeleton).

=== Changes in the nature of divination ===
The targets and purposes of divination changed over time. During the reign of Wu Ding, diviners were likely to ask the powers or ancestors about things like the weather, success in battle, or building settlements. Offerings were promised if they would help with earthly affairs.

&quot;Crack-making on jiazi (day 1) Zheng divined &quot;In praying for harvest to the sun, (we) will cleave ten dappled cows, and pledge one hundred dappled cows.&quot;&quot;&lt;br&gt;(&quot;Heji&quot; 10116; Y530.2)

Keightley explains that this divination is unique in being addressed to the sun, but typical in that 10 cattle are being offered, with 100 more to follow if the harvest is good. 

Later divinations were more likely to be perfunctory, optimistic, made by the king himself, addressed to his ancestors, on a regular cycle, and unlikely to ask the ancestors to do anything. Keightley suggests that this reflects a change in ideas about what the powers and ancestors could do, and the extent to which the living could influence them. 
== Evidence of pre-Anyang pyromancy ==
While the use of bones in divination has been practiced almost globally, divination involving fire or heat has generally been found only in Asia and the Asian-derived North American cultures. The use of heat to crack scapulae (pyro-scapulimancy) originated in ancient China, the earliest evidence of which extends back to the 4th millennium BCE with archaeological finds from Liaoning, though these were not inscribed. The scapulae of cattle, sheep, pigs, and deer used in pyromancy have been found at neolithic archeological sites, and the practice appears to have become quite common by the end of the third millennium BCE. Scapulae were unearthed along with smaller numbers of pitless plastrons in the Nánguānwài () stage at Zhengzhou; scapulae as well as smaller numbers of plastrons with chiseled pits were also discovered in the lower and upper Erligang stages.

Significant use of tortoise plastrons does not appear until the Shang culture sites. Ox scapulae and plastrons, both prepared for divination, were found at the Shang culture sites of Táixīcūn () in Hebei and Qiūwān () in Jiangsu. One or more pitted scapulae were found at Lùsìcūn () in Henan, while unpitted scapulae have been found at Erlitou in Henan, Cixian () in Hebei, Níngchéng () in Liaoning, and Qijia () in Gansu. Plastrons do not become more numerous than scapulae until the Rénmín () Park phase.

== Other sites ==
Four inscribed bones have been found at Zhengzhou: three with numbers 310, 311, and 312 in the &quot;Hebu&quot; corpus, and one that has a single character (), which also appears in late Shang inscriptions. HB 310, which contained two brief divinations, has been lost, but is recorded in a rubbing and two photographs. HB 311 and 312 each contain a pair of characters that are similar to the late Shang script. HB 312 was found in an upper layer of the Erligang culture. The others were found accidentally in river management earthworks, and so lack archaeological context. Pei Mingxiang argued that they predated the Anyang site. Takashima, referring to character forms and syntax, argues that they were contemporaneous with the reign of Wu Ding.

A turtle plastron bearing several short inscriptions was found at Daxinzhuang in Shandong on the floor of a semi-subterranean house dating from the Late Shang period. The style of characters is close to that used by particular diviner groups active at Anyang during the reign of Wu Ding, though it shows some variations.

Nearly 300 inscribed oracle bones (HB 1–290) were found in 1977 in two pits dug into a building foundation at Qijia, Fufeng County, Shaanxi, part of the Zhou ritual centre known as the Zhōuyuán.
Some of these are believed to be contemporaneous with the reign of Di Xin, the last Shang king, and others to date from the early Western Zhou.
The inscriptions are distinguished from those of Anyang in the way the bones and shells were prepared and used, the smallness of the characters, the presence of unique vocabulary, and the use of the phases of the moon as a dating device.
Four pieces (HB 1, 12, 13 and 15) have been particularly puzzling, because they refer to sacrifices in the temples of Shang ancestors, and also differ from the other bones in calligraphy and syntax.
Scholars disagree on whether they were produced at Anyang or the Zhouyuan, and whether the diviners and scribes were Shang or Zhou.

In 2003, around 600 inscribed bones were found at Zhougongmiao, a temple dedicated to the Duke of Zhou during the Tang dynasty, about west of Qijia.
They mention the Duke of Zhou and other figures of the early Western Zhou.
A handful of oracle bones have been found at other Western Zhou sites, including some from Beijing.

== After the Shang ==
After the founding of Zhou, the Shang practices of bronze casting, pyromancy, and writing continued. Oracle bones that were found in the 1970s have been dated to the Zhou dynasty, with some dating to the Spring and Autumn period; very few, however, were inscribed. It is thought that other methods of divination supplanted pyromancy, such as numerological divination using milfoil (yarrow) in connection with the hexagrams of the &quot;I Ching&quot;, leading to the decline of inscribed oracle bones. However, evidence for the continued use of plastromancy exists for the Eastern Zhou, Han, Tang, and Qing dynasty periods, and Keightley mentions its use in Taiwan as late as 1972.

<text>The Sherman Brothers were an American songwriting duo that specialized in musical films, made up of brothers Robert Sherman (December 19, 1925 – March 6, 2012) and Richard Sherman (June 12, 1928 – May 25, 2024). Together they received various accolades including two Academy Awards and three Grammy Awards. They received nominations for a Laurence Olivier Award, a BAFTA Award, and five Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the National Medal of the Arts in 2008.

The Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in film history. Their work includes the live-action films &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971) and the animated films &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967, except “The Bare Necessities,” which Terry Gilkyson wrote), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977). Among their most famous works are the theme park songs &quot;There&#x27;s A Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot;. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the latter song is the most performed song of all time.

The Shermans earned nine Academy Award nominations (with two wins), two Grammy Awards, four Grammy Award nominations, and 23 gold- and platinum-certified albums.

== Life and work ==
=== 1950s ===
Sons of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Robert and Richard Sherman began writing songs together in 1951 on a challenge from their father, Tin Pan Alley songwriter Al Sherman. The brothers wrote together and with different songwriting partners throughout the rest of the decade.

In 1958, Robert founded the music publishing company Music World Corporation, which later enjoyed a landmark relationship with Disney&#x27;s BMI-affiliated publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company. That same year, the Sherman Brothers had their first top-ten hit with &quot;Tall Paul&quot;, sung by Mouseketeer Judy Harriet on the Surf Records label and then covered by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. They wrote the international hit &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen,&quot; first recorded in 1960 by rockabilly singer Johnny Burnette, and a chart success again in 1973 for Ringo Starr. They also wrote the title song for Doris Day&#x27;s album &quot;Bright and Shiny&quot;, recorded in 1960 and released a year later.

=== 1960s ===
The success of these songs gained the attention of Walt Disney, who eventually hired the Sherman Brothers as staff songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. The first song they wrote on personal assignment by Walt Disney was &quot;Strummin&#x27; Song&quot; in 1961. It was used in the Annette Funicello made-for-television movie called &quot;The Horsemasters&quot;. The first song that the Sherman Brothers contributed to a Disney movie was &quot;Medfield Fight Song&quot; from the film &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961).

While at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical scores than any other songwriters in the history of film. They also wrote what is perhaps their best-known song, &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot;, for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Since then, some have claimed that this has become the most translated and performed song on Earth, although this is largely due to the fact that it is played continuously at Disney&#x27;s theme park &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; attractions of the same name.

In 1965, the Sherman Brothers won two Academy Awards for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, which includes the songs &quot;Feed The Birds,&quot; &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,&quot; and the Oscar-winning &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee.&quot; Starting with this movie, and continuing through several subsequent Disney movies, the Sherman Brothers collaborated with noted arranger-conductor Irwin Kostal.

Robert and Richard Sherman worked directly for Walt Disney, completing the scores for the live-action musical films &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; and &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; until Disney&#x27;s death in 1966.

Their first non-Disney assignment came with Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s motion picture production &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; for United Artists in 1968, which garnered the brothers their third Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for its particularly memorable titular song.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, the Shermans returned to Disney for a brief stint where they completed work on &quot;The Aristocats&quot; and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;. The latter film garnered the brothers their fourth and fifth Oscar nominations. 1972 saw the release of &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;, for which the brothers received a Grammy nomination.

In 1973, the Sherman Brothers also made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival for &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, for which they also authored the screenplay.

In 1976, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; was picked to be the Royal Command Performance of the year. The performance was attended by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. A modern musical adaptation of the classic Cinderella story, &quot;Slipper&quot; also featured songs, score, and screenplay by the Sherman Brothers. Two further Academy Award nominations were garnered by the brothers for the film. That same year the Sherman Brothers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame directly across from Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

The Sherman Brothers&#x27; numerous other Disney and non-Disney top box office film credits include &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961), &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1974), &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977), &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; (1972), &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971), and &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; (1989).
Outside the motion-picture realm, their Tony Award-nominated hit &quot;Over Here!&quot; (1974) was the biggest-grossing original Broadway musical of that year and broke box-office records for its Off-Broadway revival (2019).

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, the Sherman Brothers wrote the song score for the Disney film &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;. This film marked the brothers&#x27; first major motion picture for the Disney company in over 28 years, and was also their final film credit as duo because of Robert&#x27;s death in 2012.

In 2002, &quot;Chitty&quot; hit the London stage, receiving rave reviews. &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; is currently the most successful stage show ever produced at the London Palladium, boasting the longest run in that century-old theater&#x27;s history. On April 28, 2005, a second &quot;Chitty&quot; company premiered on Broadway (New York City) at the Foxwoods Theatre. The Sherman Brothers wrote an additional six songs specifically for the new stage productions.

In 2003, four Sherman Brothers&#x27; musicals ranked in the Top 10 Favorite Children&#x27;s Films of All Time in a British nationwide poll reported by the BBC. Most notably, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) topped the list at #1. In later years, with Robert&#x27;s move to London, the brothers wrote new songs for the stage musical presentation of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;. For their contributions to the motion picture industry, the Sherman brothers have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6918 Hollywood Blvd. and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 9, 2005. On November 16, 2006, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway. 

On November 17, 2008, the Sherman Brothers received the National Medal of Arts, which is the highest honor conferred on artists or patrons of the arts by the United States Government. The award was presented by United States President George W. Bush in an East Room ceremony at The White House.

On May 22, 2009, &quot;The Boys: The Sherman Brothers&#x27; Story&quot;, a critically acclaimed documentary film about the pair, was theatrically released. The film was directed and produced by their sons, Gregory V. Sherman and Jeff Sherman, and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. In October 2009, Disney released a 59-track, two-CD compendium of their work for the studio spanning 42 years. The CD is titled &quot;The Sherman Brothers Songbook&quot;. On March 11, 2010, the Sherman Brothers were presented with a specialized window on Main Street, U.S.A., at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in honor of their contribution to Disney theme parks. On May 17, 2010, the Sherman Brothers received the &quot;Career Achievement Award&quot; at The Theatre Museum&#x27;s 2010 Awards Gala in New York City.

From 2002, Robert Sherman lived in London, England. He moved from Beverly Hills, while Richard Sherman remained in California. Robert Sherman died in London on March 6, 2012. Richard Sherman died in Los Angeles on May 25, 2024.

== Influence and recognition ==

* In 2000, the Sherman Brothers wrote the award-winning score to &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; which achieved number-one status in both theatrical box office and video sales.

It was nominated for a 2003 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best New Musical. The Sherman Brothers each received the Musical Theatre Award from the Variety Club of Great Britain that year as well for &quot;Chitty&quot;, which finished a record breaking three-and-a-half-year run at the Palladium, becoming the longest running show in the theater&#x27;s century long history.

<text>The contingency model by business and management psychologist Fred Fiedler is a contingency theory concerned with the effectiveness of a leader in an organization.

== Premises ==
The most common situational theory was developed by Fred Fiedler. Fiedler believed that an individual&#x27;s leadership style is the result of their experiences throughout the lifespan and is therefore extremely difficult to change. Fiedler argued that one should concentrate on helping people understand their particular leadership style and how to match that style to the particular situation rather than teaching people a particular leadership style. Fiedler developed the least preferred coworker (LPC) scale in order to help one understand one&#x27;s specific leadership style. According to Fiedler, because leadership behavior is fixed, effectiveness can only be improved by restructuring tasks or changing the amount of power the leader had over organizational factors (such as salary, disciplinary action, and promotions).
Fiedler&#x27;s model does have some weaknesses. For example, some leaders may be more effective in certain situations than others. The LPC scale can be questioned because the assessment is performed by one individual on another.

The theory holds that the effectiveness of a task group or of an organization depends on two main factors: the personality of the leader and the degree to which the situation gives the leader power, control, and influence over the situation or, conversely, the degree to which the situation confronts the leader with uncertainty.

To Fiedler, stress is a key determinant of leader effectiveness, and a distinction is made between stress related to the leader&#x27;s superior and stress related to subordinates or the situation itself. In stressful situations, leaders dwell on the stressful relations with others and cannot focus their intellectual abilities on the job. Thus, intelligence is more effective and used more often in stress-free situations. Fiedler concludes that experience impairs performance in low-stress conditions but contributes to performance under high-stress conditions. As with other situational factors, for stressful situations Fiedler recommends altering or engineering the leadership situation to capitalize on the leader&#x27;s strengths.

Fiedler&#x27;s situational contingency theory holds that group effectiveness depends on an appropriate match between a leader&#x27;s style (essentially a trait measure) and the demands of the situation. In other words, effective leadership is contingent on matching leader&#x27;s style to the right setting. Fiedler considers situational control the extent to which a leader can determine what their group is going to do to be the primary contingency factor in determining the effectiveness of leader behavior.

Fiedler&#x27;s contingency model is a dynamic model where the personal characteristics and motivation of the leader are said to interact with the current situation that the group faces. Thus, the contingency model marks a shift away from the tendency to attribute leadership effectiveness to personality alone.

==Least preferred coworker (LPC)==

The leadership style of the leader is thus fixed and measured by what Fiedler calls the least preferred coworker (LPC) scale, an instrument for measuring an individual&#x27;s leadership orientation. The LPC scale asks a leader to think of all the people with whom they have ever worked and then describe the person with whom they have worked least well, using a series of bipolar scales of 1 to 8, such as the following:

A high LPC score suggests that the leader has a &quot;human relations orientation&quot;, while a low LPC score indicates a &quot;task orientation&quot;. Fiedler assumes that everybody&#x27;s least preferred coworker in fact is on average about equally unpleasant, but people who are relationship-motivated tend to describe their least preferred coworkers in a more positive manner, e.g., more pleasant and more efficient. Therefore, they receive higher LPC scores. People who are task-motivated, on the other hand, tend to rate their least preferred coworkers in a more negative manner. Therefore, they receive lower LPC scores. So, the least preferred coworker scale is actually not about the least preferred worker at all; instead, it is about the person who takes the test and that person&#x27;s motivation type. This is because individuals who rate their least preferred coworker in relatively favorable light on these scales derive satisfaction out of interpersonal relationship, and those who rate the coworker in a relatively unfavorable light get satisfaction out of successful task performance. This method reveals an individual&#x27;s emotional reaction to people they cannot work with. Critics point out that this is not always an accurate measurement of leadership effectiveness. Fiedler expanded his studies outside of the lab and showed the interrelations between adjustment, group performance, and leadership style in a volunteer medical team under different conditions of stress while working in isolated villages of Central America. The task-oriented leader performed better in situations that were favorable and relatively unfavorable while the relationship-oriented leader only fared better in situations of intermediate favorableness. As the LPC is a personality measure, the score is believed to be quite stable over time and not easily changed. Low LPCs tend to remain low and high LPCs tend to remain high, which shows that the test-reliability of the LPC is strong.

==Situational favorability==

According to Fiedler, the ability to control the group situation (the second component of the contingency model) is crucial for a leader. This is because only leaders with situational control can be confident that their orders and suggestions will be carried out by their followers. Leaders who are unable to assume control over the group situation cannot be sure that the members they are leading will execute their commands. Because situational control is critical to leadership efficacy, Fiedler broke this factor down into three major components: leader–member relations, task structure, and position power. Moreover, there is no ideal leader. Both low-LPC (task-oriented) and high-LPC (relationship-oriented) leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. The contingency theory allows for predicting the characteristics of the appropriate situations for effectiveness. Three situational components determine the favourableness of situational control:
# Leader–Member Relations, referring to the degree of mutual trust, respect, and confidence between the leader and the subordinates. When leader–member relations in the group are poor, the leader has to shift focus away from the group task in order to regulate behavior and conflict within the group.
# Task Structure, referring to the extent to which group tasks are clear and structured. When task structure is low (unstructured), group tasks are ambiguous, with no clear solution or correct approach to complete the goal. In contrast, when task structure is high (structured), the group goal is clear, unambiguous and straightforward: members have a clear idea about the how to approach and reach the goal.
# Leader Position Power, referring to the power inherent in the leader&#x27;s position itself.

The basic findings of the Contingency Model are that task-motivated leaders perform generally best in very &quot;favorable&quot; situations, that is, either under conditions in which their power, control, and influence are very high (or, conversely, where uncertainty is very low) or where the situation is unfavorable, where they have low power, control, and influence. Relationship-motivated leaders tend to perform best in situations in which they have moderate power, control, and influence. Both the relationship and the task-motivated leaders perform well under some situations but not under others. It is not accurate to speak of a &quot;good&quot; or a &quot;poor&quot; leader; rather, a leader may perform well in one type of situation but not in another. Outstanding directors of research teams do not necessarily make good production foremen or military leaders, and outstanding battle field commanders, like United States Army General George S. Patton, do not necessarily make good chiefs of staff or good chairmen of volunteer school picnic committees. 

When there is a good leader–member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a &quot;favorable situation.&quot; Fiedler found that low-LPC leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas high-LPC leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability. Leaders in high positions of power have the ability to distribute resources among their members, meaning they can reward and punish their followers. Leaders in low positions of power cannot control resources to the same extent as leaders in high power and so lack the same degree of situational control. For example, the CEO of a business has high position power, because she is able to increase and reduce the salary that her employees receive. On the other hand, an office worker in this same business has low position power, because although they may be the leader on a new business deal, they cannot control the situation by rewarding or disciplining their colleagues with salary changes.

== Leader–situation match and mismatch ==
Since personality is relatively stable though it can be changed, the contingency model suggests that improving effectiveness requires changing the situation to fit the leader. This is called &quot;job engineering&quot; or &quot;job restructuring&quot;. The organization or the leader may increase or decrease task structure and position power; also, training and group development may improve leader–member relations. In his 1976 book &quot;Improving Leadership Effectiveness: The Leader Match Concept&quot;, Fiedler (with Martin Chemers and Linda Mahar) offers a self paced leadership training program designed to help leaders alter the favorableness of the situation, or situational control. The advantage of contingency theory is that it “does not require that people be effective in all situations”. According to Northouse, although one person may be successful in one role, they may not be successful in another based on the environment. 

One implication of &quot;job engineering&quot; or &quot;job restructuring&quot; through additional training is that if all leaders are given the same training regardless of their position in the contingency model, it could create a mismatch between the leader and situation. &quot;The right person for a particular job today may be the wrong person in six months or in one or two years.&quot; For example, if a company has a workshop for all managers that effectively changed the task structure from low to high, it might seem good for the company at first glance, but it is important to note that leaders who were effective in a low task structure situation could become very ineffective in a situation with a high task structure. 
===Examples===
* A company that might be hiring a new manager to take on a leadership position that has poor current leader–member relations and high task structure and authority, the company would be best positioned to fill this role with a high LPC or leader–member relations to improve poor relations. Hiring someone who is more relation-oriented will help rebuild those the poor current leader–member relations.
*Task-oriented leadership would be advisable in a natural disaster, like a flood or fire. In an uncertain situation the leader–member relations are usually poor, the task is unstructured, and the position power is weak. The one who emerges as a leader to direct the group&#x27;s activity usually does not know subordinates personally. The task-oriented leader who gets things accomplished proves to be the most successful. If the leader is considerate (relationship-oriented), they may waste so much time in the disaster that things get out of control and lives are lost.
* Blue-collar workers generally want to know exactly what they are supposed to do. Therefore, their work environment is usually highly structured. The leader&#x27;s position power is strong if management backs their decision. Finally, even though the leader may not be relationship-oriented, leader–member relations may be extremely strong if they can gain promotions and salary increases for subordinates. Under these situations the task-oriented style of leadership is preferred over the (considerate) relationship-oriented style.
* The considerate (relationship-oriented) style of leadership can be appropriate in an environment where the situation is moderately favorable or certain, for example, when (1) leader–member relations are good, (2) the task is structured, and (3) position power is either strong or weak. Situations like this exist with research scientists, who do not like superiors to structure the task for them. They prefer to follow their own creative leads in order to solve problems. In a situation like this a considerate style of leadership is preferred over the task-oriented.
* The last example of a task-oriented leader is one that is in charge of large products. They have to oversee all of the operations and make decisions on behalf of the entire project. They have many tasks and goals to be set. 

==Opposing views==
Researchers often find that Fiedler&#x27;s contingency theory falls short on flexibility. They also note that LPC scores can fail to reflect the personality traits they are supposed to reflect.

Fiedler&#x27;s contingency theory has drawn criticism because it implies that the only alternative for an unalterable mismatch of leader orientation and an unfavorable situation is changing the leader. The model&#x27;s validity has also been disputed, despite many supportive tests. The contingency model does not take into account the percentage of &quot;intermediate favorability&quot; situations vs. &quot;extremely favorable or unfavorable situations&quot;; hence, it does not give a complete picture of the comparison between low-LPC leaders and high-LPC leaders.

Other criticisms concern the methodology of measuring leadership style through the LPC inventory and the nature of the supporting evidence. Fiedler and his associates have provided decades of research to support and refine the contingency theory.

==Cognitive resource theory==
Cognitive resource theory (CRT) modifies Fiedler&#x27;s basic contingency model by adding traits of the leader. CRT tries to identify the conditions under which leaders and group members will use their intellectual resources, skills, and knowledge effectively. While it has been generally assumed that more intelligent and more experienced leaders will perform better than those with less intelligence and experience, this assumption is not supported by Fiedler&#x27;s research.

<text>The path–goal theory, also known as the path–goal theory of leader effectiveness or the path–goal model, is a leadership theory developed by Robert House, an Ohio State University graduate, in 1971 and revised in 1996. The theory states that a leader&#x27;s behavior is contingent to the satisfaction, motivation and performance of his or her subordinates. The revised version also argues that the leader engages in behaviors that complement subordinate&#x27;s abilities and compensate for deficiencies. According to Robert House and John Antonakis, the task-oriented elements of the path–goal model can be classified as a form of instrumental leadership.

==Origins==
The first theory was inspired by the work of Martin G. Evans (1970), in which the leadership behaviors and the follower perceptions of the degree to which following a particular behavior (path) will lead to a particular outcome (goal). The path–goal theory was also influenced by the expectancy theory of motivation developed by Victor Vroom in 1964. Vroom built his work on the work of Georgopoulos et al. (1957): A path-goal approach to productivity. Journal of Applied Psychology. Volume 41, No. 6, pages 345–353.

==Original theory==
According to the first of all theory, the manager&#x27;s job is viewed as guiding workers to choose the best paths to reach their goals, as well as the organizational goals. The theory argues that leaders will have to engage in different types of leadership behavior depending on the nature and the demands of a particular situation. It is the leader&#x27;s job to assist followers in attaining goals and to provide the direction and support needed to ensure that their goals are compatible with the organization&#x27;s goals.

A leader&#x27;s behavior is acceptable to subordinates when viewed as a source of satisfaction, and motivational when need satisfaction is contingent on performance, and the leader facilitates, coaches, and rewards effective performance. The original path-goal theory identifies &quot;achievement-oriented&quot;, &quot;directive&quot;, &quot;participative&quot;, and &quot;supportive&quot; leader behaviors:

* The &quot;directive path-goal clarifying leader behavior&quot; refers to situations where the leader lets followers know what is expected of them and tells them how to perform their tasks. The theory argues that this behavior has the most positive effect when the subordinates&#x27; role and task demands are ambiguous and intrinsically satisfying.
* The &quot;achievement-oriented leader behavior&quot; refers to situations where the leader sets challenging goals for followers, expects them to perform at their highest level, and shows confidence in their ability to meet this expectation. Occupations in which the achievement motive were most predominant were technical jobs, sales persons, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
* The &quot;participative leader behavior&quot; involves leaders consulting with followers and asking for their suggestions before making a decision. This behavior is predominant when subordinates are highly personally involved in their work.
* The &quot;supportive leader behavior&quot; is directed towards the satisfaction of subordinates needs and preferences. The leader shows concern for the followers&#x27; psychological well being. This behavior is especially needed in situations in which tasks or relationships are psychologically or physically distressing.

Path–goal theory assumes that leaders are flexible and that they can change their style, as situations require. The theory proposes two contingency variables, such as environment and follower characteristics, that moderate the leader behavior-outcome relationship. Environment is outside the control of the follower-task structure, authority system, and work group. &quot;Environmental factors&quot; determine the type of leader behavior required if the follower outcomes are to be maximized. &quot;Follower characteristics&quot; are the locus of control, experience, and perceived ability. Personal characteristics of subordinates determine how the environment and leader are interpreted. Effective leaders clarify the path to help their followers achieve goals and make the journey easier by reducing roadblocks and pitfalls. Research demonstrates that employee performance and satisfaction are positively influenced when the leader compensates for the shortcomings in either the employee or the work setting. According to Northouse, the theory is useful because it reminds leaders that their central purpose as a leader is to help subordinates define and reach their goals in an efficient manner.

House (1971) refers to Rizzo (1970), stating that a leader initiating structure increases the path instrumentality for subordinates by decreasing role ambiguity. Also, he says that a leader who is initiating structure and consideration will have different effects depending on whether the task is satisfying or unsatisfying to the subordinate and whether the task-role demands are clear or ambiguous. This means that the more satisfying the task, the less positive the relationship is between consideration and subordinate satisfaction and performance – meaning people tend to act and enjoy it without considering whether they should not. Also, it means that when a coach is clear in setting goals and expectations, the goals are more likely to be achieved than if the goals and expectations are unclear. This is good for coaches, it means that when they can present a goal that is most satisfying to athletes, it is more likely for the athletes to have affective desire for achieving the goal.

For a college coach, practicing good ethics in this regard means creating goals that are within reach for a team, and working together with members of a team when creating these goals. Larson and LaFasto in their 1989 book &quot;TeamWork&quot; place a clear &amp; elevating goal at the forefront of the necessary components for a successful team. &quot;The image of a desired state of affairs that inspires action&quot; is how Garfield defines a clear goal, according to the authors (p. 27). They say that when the goal is &quot;unfocused and &quot;politicized&quot;, it becomes a reason for ineffective team functioning. &quot;A sense of mission&quot; is a clear characteristic of peak performers&#x27;, says Garfield, according to the authors. Larson and LaFasto make no mistake in emphasizing the importance of clarity. &quot;Elevating&quot; to the authors means &quot;personally challenging&quot; (p. 31). A player asks the personal question of how worthwhile the goal itself is, and what type of difference it makes. The elevating factor of goal setting brings about a sense of urgency, causes a team to lose track of time (relates to the idea of &quot;flow&quot; in the field of positive psychology), and causes the rate of communication to increase, for example, players calling one another in the evening, outside the sport context, to talk about today&#x27;s practice or tomorrow&#x27;s game.

<doc id="399476" wikidata="Q447349" url="?curid=399476" title="Aluminium foil">
<text>Aluminium foil (or aluminum foil in American English; occasionally called tin foil) is aluminium prepared in thin metal leaves. The foil is pliable and can be readily bent or wrapped around objects. Thin foils are fragile and are sometimes laminated with other materials such as plastics or paper to make them stronger and more useful.

Annual production of aluminium foil was approximately in Europe in 2014, and in the U.S. in 2003. Approximately 75% of aluminium foil is used for packaging of foods, cosmetics, and chemical products, and 25% is used for industrial applications (e.g., thermal insulation, electrical cables, and electronics). It can be easily recycled.
Aluminium foil supplanted tin foil in the mid 20th century. In the United Kingdom and United States it is often informally called &quot;tin foil&quot;, just as steel cans are often still called &quot;tin cans&quot;. Metallised films are sometimes mistaken for aluminium foil, but are actually polymer films coated with a thin layer of aluminium.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===

Foil made from a thin leaf of tin was commercially available before its aluminium counterpart. Tin foil was marketed commercially from the late nineteenth into the early twentieth century. The term &quot;tin foil&quot; survives in the English language as a term for the newer aluminium foil. Tin foil is less malleable than aluminium foil and tends to give a slight tin taste to food wrapped in it. Tin foil has been supplanted by aluminium and other materials for wrapping food.

The first audio recordings on phonograph cylinders were made on tin foil.

=== Invention ===
Tin was first replaced by aluminium in 1910, when the first aluminium foil rolling plant, was opened in Emmishofen, Switzerland. The plant, owned by , the aluminium manufacturers, was founded in 1886 in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, at the foot of the Rhine Falls, whose energy powered the process. In December 1907, Neher&#x27;s sons, along with Dr. Lauber, had invented the endless rolling process, by which they discovered that aluminium foil could be used as a protective barrier.

In 1911, Bern-based Tobler began wrapping its chocolate bars in aluminium foil, including the unique triangular chocolate bar, Toblerone.

The first use of foil in the United States was in 1913 for wrapping Life Savers, candy bars, and gum.

== Properties ==
Aluminium foil has a thickness less than ; thinner gauges down to are also commonly used. Standard household foil is typically thick, and heavy-duty household foil is typically .

Foil may have a non-stick coating on only one side.

Although aluminium is non-magnetic, it is a good conductor, so even a thin sheet reflects almost all of an incident electric wave. At frequencies more than 100 MHz, the transmitted electric field is attenuated by more than 80 decibels (dB), that is less than 10−8 = 0.00000001 of the power gets through.

Thin sheets of aluminium are not very effective at attenuating low-frequency magnetic fields. The shielding effectiveness is dependent upon the skin depth. A field travelling through one skin depth will lose about 63% of its energy (it is attenuated to 1/&quot;e&quot; = 1/2.718... of its original energy). Thin shields also have internal reflections that reduce the shielding effectiveness.

== Manufacture ==

The continuous casting method is much less energy-intensive and has become the preferred process. It is difficult to produce rollers with a gap fine enough to cope with the foil gauge, and to avoid this, as well as reducing tearing, increasing production rates, and controlling thickness, for the final pass when producing thicknesses below , two sheets are rolled at the same time, doubling the thickness of the gauge at entry to the rollers. After the rollers, the two sheets are separated, which produces foil with one shiny side and one matte side.

The two sides in contact with each other are matte, and the exterior sides become shiny. The reflectivity of dull aluminium foil is 80%, while shiny embossed foil reflects about 88%. The difference in thermal properties between the two sides is imperceptible without instrumentation. By Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of radiation, increased reflectivity decreases both absorption and emission of radiation.

== Uses ==
Aluminium foil is widely sold into the consumer market, often in rolls of width and several metres in length.

Aluminium foil is also used for barbecuing delicate foods.

As with all metallic items, aluminium foil reacts to being placed in a microwave oven. This is because of the electromagnetic fields of the microwaves inducing electric currents in the foil and high potentials at the sharp points of the foil sheet; if the potential is sufficiently high, it will cause electric arcing to areas with lower potential, even to the air surrounding the sheet. Modern microwave ovens have been designed to prevent damage to the cavity magnetron tube from microwave energy reflection, and aluminium packages designed for microwave heating are available.

== Environmental issues ==
Some aluminium foil products can be recycled at around 5% of the original energy cost.

<doc id="399492" wikidata="Q3240721" url="?curid=399492" title="List of U.S. state and territory abbreviations">
<text>Several sets of codes and abbreviations are used to represent the political divisions of the United States for postal addresses, data processing, general abbreviations, and other purposes.

==Table==
This table includes abbreviations for three independent countries related to the United States through Compacts of Free Association, and other comparable postal abbreviations, including those now obsolete.



==History==
As early as October 1831, the United States Postal Service recognized common abbreviations for states and territories. However, they accepted these abbreviations only because of their popularity, preferring that patrons spell names out in full to avoid confusion.

The traditional abbreviations for U.S. states and territories, widely used in mailing addresses prior to the introduction of two-letter U.S. postal abbreviations, are still commonly used for other purposes (such as legal citation), and are still recognized (though discouraged) by the Postal Service.

Modern two-letter abbreviated codes for the states and territories originated in October 1963, with the issuance of &quot;Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code&quot;, three months after the Post Office introduced ZIP codes in July 1963. The purpose, rather than to standardize state abbreviations &quot;per se&quot;, was to make room in a line of no more than 23 characters for the city, the state, and the ZIP code.

Since 1963, only one state abbreviation has changed. Originally Nebraska was &quot;NB&quot;; but, in November 1969, the Post Office changed it to &quot;NE&quot; to avoid confusion with New Brunswick in Canada.
Prior to 1987, when the U.S. Secretary of Commerce approved the two-letter codes for use in government documents, the United States Government Printing Office (GPO) suggested its own set of abbreviations, with some states left unabbreviated. Today, the GPO supports United States Postal Service standard.

===Current use of traditional abbreviations===

Legal citation manuals, such as &quot;The Bluebook&quot; and &quot;The ALWD Citation Manual&quot;, typically use the &quot;traditional abbreviations&quot; or variants thereof.

==Codes for states and territories==

===ISO standard 3166===

ISO 3166-2:US is the entry for the United States in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.

===ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009===
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established alphabetic and numeric codes for each state and outlying areas in ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009. ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009 replaced the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) standards FIPS 5-2, FIPS 6-4, and FIPS 10-4. The ANSI alphabetic state code is the same as the USPS state code except for U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, which have an ANSI code &quot;UM&quot; but no USPS code—and U.S. Military Mail locations, which have USPS codes (&quot;AA&quot;, &quot;AE&quot;, &quot;AP&quot;) but no ANSI code.

===Postal codes===
The United States Postal Service (USPS) has established a set of uppercase abbreviations to help process mail with optical character recognition and other automated equipment. There are also official USPS abbreviations for other parts of the address, such as street designators (street, avenue, road, etc.).

These two-letter codes are distinguished from traditional abbreviations such as Calif., Fla., or Tex. The Associated Press Stylebook states that in contexts other than mailing addresses, the traditional state abbreviations should be used. However, the Chicago Manual of Style now recommends use of the uppercase two-letter abbreviations, with the traditional forms as an option.

The postal abbreviation is the same as the ISO 3166-2 subdivision code for each of the fifty states.

These codes do not overlap with the 13 Canadian subnational postal abbreviations. The code for Nebraska changed from NB to NE in November 1969 to avoid a conflict with New Brunswick. Canada likewise chose MB for Manitoba to prevent conflict with either Massachusetts (MA), Michigan (MI), Minnesota (MN), Missouri (MO), or Montana (MT).

===Coast Guard vessel prefixes===
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) uses a set of two-letter prefixes for vessel numbers; 39 states and the District of Columbia have the same USPS and USCG abbreviations. USCG prefixes have also been established for five outlying territories; all are the same as the USPS abbreviations except the Mariana Islands. The twelve cases where USPS and USCG abbreviations differ are listed below and marked in bold red in the table above; they include three inland states with a small Coast Guard contingent. These twelve abbreviations were changed to avoid conflicting with the ISO 3166 two-digit country codes.

<text>Thomas Tafirenyika Mapfumo (born July 3, 1945) is a Zimbabwean musician. He is nicknamed &quot;The Lion of Zimbabwe&quot; and &quot;Mukanya&quot; (the praise name of his clan in the Shona language) for his immense popularity and for the political influence he wields through his music, including his sharp criticism of the government of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. He both created and popularized Chimurenga music, and is known for his distinctive voice and slow-moving style.

Mapfumo was imprisoned without charges under the white-dominated regime of Rhodesia, and he was hounded by the Mugabe government of Zimbabwe that succeeded it. He lived in exile in the United States for two decades, and in April 2018, returned to Zimbabwe for the first time since 2005 to perform a concert.

==Biography==
Mapfumo was born in 1945 in Marondera, Mashonaland East, a town southeast of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, though at the time the capital was called Salisbury and the country was a colony of Great Britain called Southern Rhodesia (becoming Rhodesia in ordinary usage after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). He lived a traditional, rural Shona lifestyle until the age of ten, when his family moved to the Harare township of Mbare. It was during these early years that he was exposed to the traditional music of the Shona, the influence of which would drive his later music to incorporate and/or reflect the sounds of the ngoma drum and the mbira, a metal-pronged instrument with spiritual importance.

==Early career==
He joined his first band, the Zutu Brothers (although, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says it was the Cyclones), as a singer at the age of 16. From then he was always in one band or another, such as The Wagon Wheels with Afro jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi and guitarist James Chimombe sometimes doing odd jobs on the side as well, including chicken farming. Hence the name of his 1972 band, the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band.

He played mostly covers of American rock and soul tunes, such as Otis Redding or Elvis Presley, until he was in the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band. There he introduced the innovation of adapting traditional Shona music to modern rock instrumentation.

He worked with guitarist Joshua Dube (Leopard Man&#x27;s &quot;Africa Music Guide&quot; says Jonah Sithole) to transcribe the sounds of the chief instrument of traditional Shona music, the mbira to the electric guitar. He also started singing primarily in the Shona language, rather than in English. Joshua Dube started to experiment mbira on guitar on Take One recorded in 1974 

==Political undertones==
Simply drawing on the native musical tradition and singing in his native language was a political statement. Rhodesia was ruled by a minority of white individuals who derogated the native black population and culture. But more than that, his lyrics became overtly political, supporting the revolution that was developing in the rural areas, what the Rhodesian government called &quot;the communal lands&quot;. He called his new style of music Chimurenga. In Shona it is derived from one of the architects of the first Black Uprising of 1896 called Murenga, and is the name of the wars of liberation in both the late 19th century and the bush war from 1960s up to the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979. His songs openly called for the violent overthrow of the government, with lyrics like &quot;Mothers, send your sons to war.&quot;

==Political overtones==
Mapfumo&#x27;s music caught the attention of the Rhodesian government with his song &quot;Hokoyo!&quot;, meaning &quot;Watch out!&quot; The government banned the record from the state-controlled radio and threw him into a prison camp without charges in 1979. They were unable to stop his records from being played in discos or on radio stations they did not control, including the Voice of Mozambique. Large demonstrations in protest of his arrest and an inability to find charges against him forced the government to release him after three months.

Free elections were held in 1980, and a new government was installed. Mapfumo performed at a celebratory concert that also featured Bob Marley. In later years, he would come to criticize the same government he, in some ways, helped bring to power.

The PRI-syndicated radio program Afropop Worldwide ran a feature on Thomas Mapfumo in late 1988/early 1989. Host Georges Collinet describes Mapfumo as living in the low-density suburbs with his wife, who worked at a law office in downtown Harare, and his two children—a boy and a girl. And he drove a blue Ford with fake leopard-skin seat covers.

Most of his songs were still political, dealing with poverty and other social issues. Mapfumo comments on the fact that he does not sing many love songs: &quot;All you need if you wanna get into the bedroom... You&#x27;ve got a wife. You do it. You don&#x27;t have to sing a song about it.&quot; Collinet also observes that Mapfumo can not sing anything he wants: &quot;Clearly he can&#x27;t sing &#x27;Down with President Mugabe&#x27; – but he wouldn&#x27;t want to. He supports the present government.&quot; However, that would soon change.

Recorded at Shed Studios in Harare, by long-time engineer Benny Miller, Mapfumo released the album &quot;Corruption&quot; in 1989. It criticised Mugabe and his government, with which Mapfumo was becoming more and more disillusioned. Mugabe was not happy with Mapfumo, either, and Mapfumo became the target of government harassment. Mapfumo was accused of being involved with a stolen-car ring. Things got uncomfortable enough that Mapfumo moved to Eugene, Oregon in the late 1990s. After Mugabe&#x27;s overthrow in 2017, he returned to Zimbabwe, to a massive show named &#x27;Homecoming Bira&#x27; at Glamis Arena in Harare on April 28, 2018. The homecoming show proved that Mapfumo was out of political danger, and he returned for more shows in many parts of Zimbabwe between December 2018 and March 2019. He returned to his United States base after the four-month visit to Zimbabwe.

Thomas Mapfumo tours internationally, and still sings and speaks out about the problems of Zimbabwe. His Chimurenga style of music influenced other Zimbabwean musicians, including the Bhundu Boys and Stella Chiweshe.

<doc id="399520" wikidata="Q1149752" url="?curid=399520" title="List of interface bit rates">
<text>This is a list of interface bit rates, is a measure of information transfer rates, or digital bandwidth capacity, at which digital interfaces in a computer or network can communicate over various kinds of buses and channels. The distinction can be arbitrary between a &quot;computer bus&quot;, often closer in space, and larger telecommunications networks. Many device interfaces or protocols (e.g., SATA, USB, SAS, PCIe) are used both inside many-device boxes, such as a PC, and one-device-boxes, such as a hard drive enclosure. Accordingly, this page lists both the internal ribbon and external communications cable standards together in one sortable table.

==Factors limiting actual performance, criteria for real decisions==
Most of the listed rates are theoretical maximum throughput measures; in practice, the actual effective throughput is almost inevitably lower in proportion to the load from other devices (network/bus contention), physical or temporal distances, and other overhead in data link layer protocols etc. The maximum goodput (for example, the file transfer rate) may be even lower due to higher layer protocol overhead and data packet retransmissions caused by line noise or interference such as crosstalk, or lost packets in congested intermediate network nodes. All protocols lose something, and the more robust ones that deal resiliently with very many failure situations tend to lose more maximum throughput to get higher total long-term rates.

Device interfaces where one bus transfers data via another will be limited to the throughput of the slowest interface, at best. For instance, SATA revision 3.0 () controllers on one PCI Express 2.0 () channel will be limited to the rate and have to employ more channels to get around this problem. Early implementations of new protocols very often have this kind of problem. The physical phenomena on which the device relies (such as spinning platters in a hard drive) will also impose limits; for instance, no spinning platter shipping in 2009 saturates SATA revision 2.0 (), so moving from this interface to USB 3.0 at for one spinning drive will result in no increase in realized transfer rate.

Contention in a wireless or noisy spectrum, where the physical medium is entirely out of the control of those who specify the protocol, requires measures that also use up throughput. Wireless devices, BPL, and modems may produce a higher line rate or gross bit rate, due to error-correcting codes and other physical layer overhead. It is extremely common for throughput to be far less than half of theoretical maximum, though the more recent technologies (notably BPL) employ preemptive spectrum analysis to avoid this and so have much more potential to reach actual gigabit rates in practice than prior modems.

Another factor reducing throughput is deliberate policy decisions made by Internet service providers that are made for contractual, risk management, aggregation saturation, or marketing reasons. Examples are rate limiting, bandwidth throttling, and the assignment of IP addresses to groups. These practices tend to minimize the throughput available to every user, but maximize the number of users that can be supported on one backbone.

Furthermore, chips are often not available in order to implement the fastest rates. AMD, for instance, does not support the 32-bit HyperTransport interface on any CPU it has shipped as of the end of 2009. Additionally, WiMAX service providers in the US typically support only up to as of the end of 2009.

Choosing service providers or interfaces based on theoretical maxima is unwise, especially for commercial needs. A good example is large scale data centers, which should be more concerned with price per port to support the interface, wattage and heat considerations, and total cost of the solution. Because some protocols such as SCSI and Ethernet now operate many orders of magnitude faster than when originally deployed, scalability of the interface is one major factor, as it prevents costly shifts to technologies that are not backward compatible. Underscoring this is the fact that these shifts often happen involuntarily or by surprise, especially when a vendor abandons support for a proprietary system.

==Conventions==
By convention, bus and network data rates are denoted either in bits per second () or bytes per second (). In general, parallel interfaces are quoted in and serial in . The more commonly used is shown below in bold type.

On devices like modems, bytes may be more than 8 bits long because they may be individually padded out with additional start and stop bits; the figures below will reflect this. Where channels use line codes (such as Ethernet, Serial ATA, and PCI Express), quoted rates are for the decoded signal.

The figures below are simplex data rates, which may conflict with the duplex rates vendors sometimes use in promotional materials. Where two values are listed, the first value is the downstream rate and the second value is the upstream rate.

The use of decimal prefixes is standard in data communications.

==Bandwidths==
The figures below are grouped by network or bus type, then sorted within each group from lowest to highest bandwidth; gray shading indicates a lack of known implementations.

As stated above, all quoted bandwidths are for each direction. Therefore, for duplex interfaces (capable of simultaneous transmission both ways), the stated values are simplex (one way) speeds, rather than total upstream+downstream.

===Radio clock===
Time signal station to radio clock
===Teletypewriter (TTY) or telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD)===
===Modems (narrowband and broadband)===

====Narrowband (POTS: 4 kHz channel)====
====Broadband (hundreds of kHz to GHz wide)====
===Mobile telephone interfaces===
===Wide area networks===
===Local area networks===
===Wireless networks===
802.11 networks in infrastructure mode are half-duplex; all stations share the medium. In infrastructure or access point mode, all traffic has to pass through an Access Point (AP). Thus, two stations on the same access point that are communicating with each other must have each and every frame transmitted twice: from the sender to the access point, then from the access point to the receiver. This approximately halves the effective bandwidth.

802.11 networks in ad hoc mode are still half-duplex, but devices communicate directly rather than through an access point. In this mode all devices must be able to &quot;see&quot; each other, instead of only having to be able to &quot;see&quot; the access point.

===Wireless personal area networks===
===Computer buses===

====Main buses====
 LPC protocol includes high overhead. While the gross data rate equals 33.3 million 4-bit-transfers per second (or ), the fastest transfer, firmware read, results in . The next fastest bus cycle, 32-bit ISA-style DMA write, yields only . Other transfers may be as low as .

 Uses 128b/130b encoding, meaning that about 1.54% of each transfer is used for error detection instead of carrying data between the hardware components at each end of the interface. For example, a single link PCIe 3.0 interface has an transfer rate, yet its usable bandwidth is only about .

 Uses 8b/10b encoding, meaning that 20% of each transfer is used by the interface instead of carrying data from between the hardware components at each end of the interface. For example, a single link PCIe 1.0 has a transfer rate, yet its usable bandwidth is only (250 ).

 Uses PAM-4 encoding and a 256 bytes FLIT block, of which 14 bytes are FEC and CRC, meaning that 5.47% of total data rate is used for error detection and correction instead of carrying data. For example, a single link PCIe 6.0 interface has an total transfer rate, yet its usable bandwidth is only .

====Portable====
====Storage====

===Dynamic random-access memory===
The table below shows values for PC memory module types.
These modules usually combine multiple chips on one circuit board.
SIMM modules connect to the computer via an 8-bit- or 32-bit-wide interface. RIMM modules used by RDRAM are 16-bit- or 32-bit-wide.
DIMM modules connect to the computer via a 64-bit-wide interface.
Some other computer architectures use different modules with a different bus width.

In a single-channel configuration, only one module at a time can transfer information to the CPU.
In multi-channel configurations, multiple modules can transfer information to the CPU at the same time, in parallel.
FPM, EDO, SDR, and RDRAM memory was not commonly installed in a dual-channel configuration. DDR and DDR2 memory is usually installed in single- or dual-channel configuration. DDR3 memory is installed in single-, dual-, tri-, and quad-channel configurations.
Bit rates of multi-channel configurations are the product of the module bit-rate (given below) and the number of channels.

 The clock rate at which DRAM memory cells operate. The memory latency is largely determined by this rate. Note that until the introduction of DDR4 the internal clock rate saw relatively slow progress. DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory uses 2n/4n/8n (respectively) prefetch buffer to provide higher throughput, while the internal memory speed remains similar to that of the previous generation.

 The memory speed or clock rate advertised by manufactures and suppliers usually refers to this rate (with 1 GT/s = 1 GHz). Note that modern types of memory use DDR bus with two transfers per clock.

===Graphics processing units&#x27; RAM===
RAM memory modules are also utilised by graphics processing units; however, memory modules for those differ somewhat from standard computer memory, particularly with lower power requirements, and are specialised to serve GPUs: for example, GDDR3 was fundamentally based on DDR2. Every graphics memory chip is directly connected to the GPU (point-to-point). The total GPU memory bus width varies with the number of memory chips and the number of lanes per chip. For example, GDDR5 specifies either 16 or 32 lanes per &quot;device&quot; (chip), while GDDR5X specifies 64 lanes per chip. Over the years, bus widths rose from 64-bit to 512-bit and beyond: e.g. HBM is 1024 bits wide.
Because of this variability, graphics memory speeds are sometimes compared per pin. For direct comparison to the values for 64-bit modules shown above, video RAM is compared here in 64-lane lots, corresponding to two chips for those devices with 32-bit widths.
In 2012, high-end GPUs used 8 or even 12 chips with 32 lanes each, for a total memory bus width of 256 or 384 bits. Combined with a transfer rate per pin of 5 GT/s or more, such cards could reach 240 GB/s or more.

RAM frequencies used for a given chip technology vary greatly. Where single values are given below, they are examples from high-end cards. Since many cards have more than one pair of chips, the total bandwidth is correspondingly higher. For example, high-end cards often have eight chips, each 32 bits wide, so the total bandwidth for such cards is four times the value given below.

===Digital audio===
===Digital video interconnects===
Data rates given are from the video source (e.g., video card) to receiving device (e.g., monitor) only. Out of band and reverse signaling channels are not included.

 Uses 8b/10b encoding (20% coding overhead) Uses 16b/18b encoding (11% overhead) Uses 128b/132b encoding (3% overhead)

<text>CompUSA, Inc., was a retailer and reseller of personal computers, consumer electronics, technology products and computer services. Starting with one brick-and-mortar store in 1986 under the name Soft Warehouse, by the 1990s CompUSA had grown into a nationwide big box chain. At its peak, it operated at least 229 locations. Crushed by competition from other brick-and-mortar retailers, corporate oversight which was out of touch with evolving market realities, and a failure to make a strong transition to online sales, CompUSA began closing what they classified as &quot;low performing&quot; locations in 2006. By 2008 only 16 locations were left to be sold to Systemax. In 2012, remaining CompUSA and Circuit City stores were converted to TigerDirect stores, and later closed. As of 2023, the CompUSA online website redirects to an error page.

==History==
Founded in 1984 as Soft Warehouse in Addison, Texas, a northern suburb of Dallas, Texas, by Errol Jacobson and Mike Henochowicz, the company began national expansion in 1988 with its first megastore opening in Atlanta, Georgia.

In 1991, the company&#x27;s name was changed to CompUSA, and the company became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. While under Nathan P. Morton&#x27;s leadership, CompUSA grew to over $2 billion in revenues. Morton resigned in 1993.

Formerly headquartered in Miami, Florida, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Commercial Corp S.A.B. de C.V. associated with Grupo Carso and indirectly controlled by a common shareholder, Carlos Slim.

On December 7, 2007, an affiliate of the restructuring and disposition firm Gordon Brothers Group, Specialty Equity, bought the company. Systemax purchased the CompUSA name, 16 retail locations and other company assets in January 2008.

Systemax operated CompUSA retail stores in California, Florida, Texas, Maryland, Georgia, Illinois, Delaware, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington and Puerto Rico, as well as CompUSA.com, a retail website and a dedicated catalog site for businesses.

On November 2, 2012, Systemax announced that it would drop both the CompUSA and Circuit City storefront names, consolidating their businesses under the name, TigerDirect. On December 4, 2013, CompUSA intellectual properties were sold to JASALI 645 Realty LLC. On October 25, 2018, the intellectual properties of CompUSA were leased to DealCentral, and has announced to relaunch CompUSA.com in that same day.

==Closings and sale to Systemax==

On or immediately before February 28, 2007, CompUSA retained the services of Gordon Brothers, a company that specializes in asset recovery and restructuring, for the purposes of closing 126 stores nationwide. The closing locations were chosen based upon their overall performance, profitability, and proximity to competitors such as Best Buy, Fry&#x27;s Electronics, Micro Center, and Circuit City. This first round of closings reduced the number of stores to less than half of its previous number.

During the liquidation process, the stores typically offered discounts starting at 5 to 30 percent off of retail prices, ending at up to 95 percent. Liquidation was completed on May 14, 2007.

On December 7, 2007, CompUSA was sold to Specialty Equity, an affiliate of Gordon Brothers Group.

On January 6, 2008, a month after CompUSA was sold to liquidators, Systemax, Inc. (TigerDirect&#x27;s then-parent company) announced its purchase of 16 CompUSA locations as well as the brand, trademarks, e-commerce business, and technical services.

Systemax also had announced that the eleven existing and three TigerDirect-branded retail stores that were under construction would be converted to the CompUSA brand over the spring of 2008.

On November 2, 2012, it was announced that Systemax would drop both the CompUSA and Circuit City storefront brands by consolidating their businesses under the TigerDirect brand and website. That officially marked the end of the heritage CompUSA brand name as used by Systemax. Customers of both businesses were informed via e-mail on November 7, 2012.

<doc id="399532" wikidata="Q2270237" url="?curid=399532" title="The Rhythm of the Saints">
<text>The Rhythm of the Saints is the eighth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon, released on October 16, 1990, by Warner Bros. In much the same way that Simon&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Graceland&quot;, released in 1986, drew upon South African music, this album was inspired by Brazilian musical traditions. Like its predecessor, the album was commercially successful and received mostly favorable reviews from critics.

In 1992, &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot; earned two nominations for the 34th Grammy Awards – Album of the Year and Producer of the Year.

==Background==
Simon had traveled to Brazil on five different occasions between 1988 and 1989, taking particular interest in the sounds coming from various street musicians that he encountered. He was encouraged to visit Brazil after Eddie Palmieri told him that &quot;the journey of the drum goes with the slave trade, from West Africa to Brazil, then up the Caribbean.&quot; During his time in the city of Salvador, Bahia, he encountered the music ensemble Grupo Cultural Olodum after hearing that they were rehearsing there. Simon was impressed with their playing and recorded the ensemble two days later for &quot;The Obvious Child&quot;, which became the opening track to &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot;.

On &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, Simon decided to build many of the tracks around polyrhythmic percussion patterns. He said that the rhythms influenced some of the melodies and lyrics that later accompanied the compositions. Simon constructed chord changes around these rhythms and described the chord progressions on &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot; as &quot;more adventurous&quot; than the work on his previous album, &quot;Graceland&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the US album chart, while &quot;Graceland&quot; had peaked at No. 3, ranking them both among Simon&#x27;s most commercially successful albums. The album was also successful across the Atlantic, reaching No. 1 on the UK album chart. However, with the exception of &quot;The Obvious Child&quot;, none of its three singles—including &quot;Proof&quot; and &quot;Born at the Right Time&quot;—charted or received substantial radio play. &quot;The Obvious Child&quot; also failed to reach the US top 40, although it reached No. 15 in the UK, becoming Simon&#x27;s last major hit there. The album was certified Multi-Platinum.

== Central Park concert ==
Alongside various musicians, Simon performed live versions of many of the songs from the album at a free concert in Central Park, New York City on August 15, 1991, in front of an audience of around 500,000 people. The performance was recorded and later released as the album &quot;Paul Simon&#x27;s Concert in the Park&quot;.

== Track listing ==

Notes:

*&quot;Thelma&quot; previously appeared on &quot;Paul Simon 1964/1993&quot;.
*According to Robert J. Reina of &quot;Stereophile&quot; magazine, Simon&#x27;s original track sequence was changed when &quot;the boys in Warners&#x27; front office insisted the album&#x27;s lead single, &#x27;The Obvious Child&#x27; be given pride of place.&quot; To hear Simon&#x27;s preferred track order, the current release would have to be re-sequenced as 3-6-4-7-8-1-2-9-5-10. At least two sleeves reflecting this track listing are known to exist.

<text>Andrei Gennadyevich Kirilenko (; born February 18, 1981), nicknamed AK-47, is a Russian basketball executive and former professional basketball player.

At age fifteen, Kirilenko began playing professional basketball in the Russian Basketball Super League. He played for CSKA Moscow from 1998 to 2001, winning the Russian league MVP award in 2000. In 1999, the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association selected Kirilenko with the twenty-fourth overall pick of the NBA draft. He became the first Russian player selected in the first round of an NBA draft and the youngest European player ever chosen in the NBA draft. Kirilenko joined the Jazz in 2001 and played for the team until 2010. He made the NBA All-Rookie First Team, was an NBA All-Defensive Team pick three times, played in the 2004 All-Star Game, and led the NBA in blocked shots in the 2004–2005 season. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Kirilenko returned to Russia to play for CSKA Moscow, leading the team to the 2012 EuroLeague Final. That year, he was named the EuroLeague MVP, earned an All-EuroLeague first team selection and won the EuroLeague Best Defender award. Kirilenko returned to the NBA for the 2012–2013 season to play for the Minnesota Timberwolves before finishing his NBA career as a member of the Brooklyn Nets in 2014.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Kirilenko became a regular member of the Russian national team. With Russia, he won the EuroBasket title in 2007, earning MVP honors in the process. In 2011, he and his team won a bronze medal. He was selected to the All-Tournament Team on both occasions. Kirilenko was named FIBA Europe Men&#x27;s Player of the Year twice and won a Euroscar Player of the Year award in 2012.

Kirilenko was elected president of the Russian Basketball Federation in 2015.

==Early life==
Kirilenko was born in the Soviet city of Izhevsk, Russia. When he was ten, he began playing organized basketball.

== Professional career ==
=== Spartak St. Petersburg (1997–1998) ===
In 1997, Kirilenko became the youngest player ever to compete in the Russian Super League, spending two seasons with Spartak Saint Petersburg.

=== CSKA Moscow (1998–2001) ===
Kirilenko joined CSKA Moscow in 1998. In his first season, he helped his new team win the Russian Super League championship. He was also selected to participate in the Russian All-Star game, helping the West beat the East 138–107 and winning the slam dunk contest.

On June 30, 1999, at age , Kirilenko was the youngest foreign player at the time to be drafted in the National Basketball Association, when the Utah Jazz selected him with the 24th pick. Kirilenko was also the first Russian picked in the first round of an NBA Draft. However, he remained with CSKA Moscow for the next two seasons. In the 1999–2000 season, he helped his team win the championship of the North European Basketball League and its second Russian Super League championship in a row. On April 23, 2000, he participated in his second Russian All-Star game, helping the West beat the East 122–111. Despite being the odds-on favorite to win the slam dunk contest, he finished second to Harold Deane of Lokomotiv Mineralnye Vody.

He showed off his all-around skills in the 2000–01 SuproLeague, finishing in the top ten in 7 out of 8 statistical categories.

===Partizan===
In August 2001, Kirilenko signed a contract with Yugoslav team Partizan ICN which included an NBA-out clause option.

===Utah Jazz (2001–2011)===
Kirilenko joined the Utah Jazz on a rookie-scale contract in September 2001. On March 15, 2002, when starting in place of injured teammate Karl Malone, Kirilenko scored a then-career-high 27 points during a 100–97 win over the Detroit Pistons. He was named to the first team on the NBA All-Rookie Team. He would emerge as one of the top young players in the NBA, and one of the league&#x27;s top weak-side defenders. He was selected to play in the 2004 NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles. In the 2003–04 NBA season, he ranked third in the league in blocked shots per game and fourth in the league in steals per game, becoming just the second player in NBA history to rank in the top five in both categories (David Robinson ranked first in blocked shots per game and fifth in steals per game in the 1991–92 NBA season). During the NBA off-season, Kirilenko played for the Russian national basketball team.

Kirilenko became the leader of the Jazz in 2003 after John Stockton retired and Karl Malone left Utah to join the Los Angeles Lakers. He played and started in 78 of the Utah&#x27;s 82 games and led them to a 42–40 record. Utah missed the playoffs by one game behind the Denver Nuggets. He finished fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and fourth in Most Improved Player voting and was named to the second team on the All-NBA Defensive Team. Kirilenko led the Jazz in many statistical categories:
*Total points: 1,284
*Points per game: 16.5
*Total rebounds: 629
*Rebounds per game: 8.1
*Blocks: 215
*Blocks per game: 2.8
*Steals: 150
*Steals per game: 1.9
*Free throws made: 392
*Free throws attempted: 496
*Three-pointers made: 68
*Three-pointers attempted: 201

In the middle of the 2004–05 season against the Washington Wizards, Kirilenko sustained a broken right wrist, sidelining him for the remainder of the season. Despite only playing in 41 of 82 games for the Jazz, he amassed enough blocked shots during the season to qualify as the league leader in blocks per game, and was named to the second team on the NBA All-Defensive Team.

In the 2005–06 season Kirilenko was again among the league&#x27;s best shot blockers and defenders. He recorded a career high 10 blocks against Indiana on March 26, and finished first in the league with total blocks (220) and second in blocks per game with 3.2, just behind league leader Marcus Camby at 3.3. He was named to the first team on the NBA All-Defensive Team.

Kirilenko averaged 15.3 points, 8 rebounds, 1.5 steals, 3.2 blocks and 4.3 assists per game in the 2005–2006 season.

Kirilenko and Hakeem Olajuwon are the only 2 NBA players who have finished a game with at least 6 steals, 6 blocks, 6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists since 1985–86.

The 2006–2007 season was a tremendous disappointment for Kirilenko. While playing in 70 games and not missing much playing time, he averaged career lows in points (8.3) and field goal attempts (6.0). It has been said that much of this decline can be attributed to the main offensive emphasis on Carlos Boozer, Deron Williams, and Mehmet Okur, and that Kirilenko was uncomfortable losing his position as the main go-to guy on the team. His frustration eventually culminated in a widely publicized breakdown near the end of the Jazz&#x27;s first-round playoffs series against the Houston Rockets. Kirilenko bounced back to lead Russia to the championship in EuroBasket 2007, and was named MVP of the tournament. Following his performance in the 2007 EuroBasket, he asked to be released from his contract to return to Russia to play basketball.

Despite the trade rumors and controversy created by these statements, he rebounded in the 2007–08 NBA season and backed off on trade demands. His statistics for the 2007–08 NBA season were 11.0 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 4.0 apg, 1.2 spg, and 1.5 bpg, all of which were improvements over his previous season&#x27;s stats (with the exception of blocks and rebounds). He worked out personally with former Jazz shooting guard Jeff Hornacek on his shooting in the 2007 off-season, and his field goal percentage improved from 47% to 51%. Most impressively, his 3-point shooting improved from 21% to a career-high 38%.

=== Return to CSKA (2011–2012) ===
Amid the 2011 NBA lockout, Kirilenko returned to Russia to play for his old team CSKA Moscow. Although the lockout was resolved in December, Kirilenko remained with CSKA Moscow for the rest of the season rather than pursuing an immediate return to the NBA. Over 17 games in the EuroLeague, he averaged 14.1 points and 7.5 rebounds in 29.9 minutes per game, leading the team to the 2012 EuroLeague Final. Kirilenko was named the EuroLeague MVP, earned an All-EuroLeague first team selection and won the EuroLeague Best Defender award.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2012–2013)===
On July 27, 2012, Kirilenko signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was the team&#x27;s starting small forward, playing in 64 games during the 2012–13 NBA season. Kirilenko missed 18 games because of back spasms, then a right quadriceps strain, and finally a calf strain. He finished the season with averages of 12.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and a 51% field goal percentage per game. He had his best game on November 14, 2012, when he had 26 points and 12 rebounds on an 89–87 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. On June 29, 2013, Kirilenko opted out of the final year of his contract with the Timberwolves (worth $10 million) to become a free agent.

===Brooklyn Nets (2013–2014)===
On July 12, 2013, Kirilenko signed a two-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets. On June 23, 2014, he exercised his $3.3 million player option, re-signing with the Nets for the 2014–15 season. On November 21, 2014, he took a leave of absence from the Nets for personal reasons.

=== Third stint with CSKA (2015) ===
On December 11, 2014, Kirilenko was traded, along with Jorge Gutiérrez, the Nets&#x27; second round draft pick in 2020 and the right to swap second round picks in 2018, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Brandon Davies. The 76ers suspended Kirilenko without pay on January 9, 2015, for failing to report after the trade, and on February 21, he was waived by the 76ers before playing in a game for them.

On February 24, 2015, Kirilenko signed with CSKA Moscow of the VTB United League for the rest of the 2014–15 season, returning to the club for a third stint. With Kirilenko at the club for the second half of the season, CSKA Moscow managed to advance to the EuroLeague Final Four for the fourth straight season, after eliminating Panathinaikos for the second straight season in the quarterfinals, with a 3–1 series win. However, in the semi-final game, despite being dubbed by media as an absolute favorite to advance, Kirilenko&#x27;s team, CSKA, once again lost to Olympiacos. The final score was 70–68, after a great Olympiacos comeback in the fourth quarter, led by Vassilis Spanoulis. CSKA Moscow eventually won the third place game, after defeating Fenerbahçe 86–80. Over 11 games played in the EuroLeague, he averaged 8.5 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. CSKA Moscow finished the season by winning the VTB United League, after eliminating Khimki with a 3–0 series win in the league&#x27;s finals series.

On June 23, 2015, Kirilenko announced his retirement as a professional basketball player.

==National team career==
As a member of the Russian junior national team, Kirilenko was the MVP of the 1999 FIBA Under-19 World Cup. Kirilenko&#x27;s first major international tournament with the senior Russian national basketball team was at the 2000 Summer Olympics, where Russia finished the games in 8th place. Later, he played at the EuroBasket 2001, where Russia finished 5th among 16 teams. The only time that Kirilenko played in a FIBA World Cup was at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, where the Russian team finished 10th out of 16 teams. Kirilenko has also played at 4 more EuroBaskets: the EuroBasket 2003, the EuroBasket 2005, the EuroBasket 2007, where he won the gold medal of the competition, and was named the MVP of the tournament, and the EuroBasket 2011. With the win in the 2007 EuroBasket, Russia qualified to the 2008 Summer Olympics, where Kirilenko also played for Russia, and he was also named Russia&#x27;s flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony of the games.
In the first game of the 2008 Olympics tournament against Iran, Kirilenko scored 15 points, pulled down 5 rebounds, and blocked 3 shots. Against Croatia, he led his team in points scored with 18, and he scored his personal best in the games against Argentina, scoring 23.

Kirilenko won a bronze medal with Russia at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==Career as executive==
In August 2015, Kirilenko was elected president of the Russian Basketball Federation. He was re-elected to the post in August 2020.

==Player profile==

Kirilenko was a versatile &quot;big man&quot; who could play either forward spot. He was noted for his high-level play in both offense (11.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game NBA career averages) and defense (twice topping three blocks per game for a season). On offense, he was proficient in drawing fouls, passing, and possessed a quick first step. He was three times selected into the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team. Staples of Kirilenko&#x27;s defensive power were his shot blocking (with an NBA career average of 1.8 per game) and in stealing the ball (NBA career average of 1.4 per game).

On January 3, 2006, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Kirilenko posted a stat line of 14 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists, 6 steals, and 7 blocks. This was the third time in his career he achieved a five-by-five, making him one of only three players (the others being Hakeem Olajuwon and Victor Wembanyama) to achieve this feat more than once in NBA history. It was also the first-ever regulation &quot;5×6&quot; — a game in which a player registers at least 6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, 6 blocks, and 6 steals — since the NBA began recording blocks and steals in the 1973–74 season. In 1987, Olajuwon had 38 points, 17 rebounds, 12 blocks, 7 steals, and 6 assists for the Houston Rockets, in a double-overtime win over the Seattle SuperSonics, the only other time a player has earned a 5×6.

In June 2015, FiveThirtyEight reviewed Kirilenko&#x27;s statistics, finding that his efficiency in scoring, steals, blocks, assists, offensive rebounds, and all-around versatility would justify consideration for the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Kirilenko is nicknamed &quot;AK-47&quot; in reference to his initials, the jersey number he wore, and the AK-47 rifle. Coincidentally, Kirilenko was born in the city of Izhevsk, in the former Soviet Union (now in Russia) where the weapon was first manufactured.

==Personal life==
Kirilenko is married to Russian pop singer Masha &quot;Marina&quot; Lopatova, whose stage name is MaLo. Lopatova is the daughter of Russian basketball player Andrey Lopatov. Kirilenko met Lopatova at a youth basketball camp in Moscow, and Kirilenko appeared in one of Lopatova&#x27;s music videos. In January 2011, Kirilenko and his wife acquired American citizenship. The couple have three sons, Fedor, Stepan and Andrey, and a daughter named Alexandra. They live in Los Angeles. &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; reported in 2006 that Masha allows Andrei to have sex with another woman once per year and quoted her: &quot;Male athletes in this country are extremely attractive. They get chased by women. It&#x27;s hard to resist. It&#x27;s the way men are by nature.&quot;

Sources suggest Kirilenko was a World of Warcraft (WoW) gamer while playing in the NBA. In the words of former NBA player Channing Frye, he shared a story about being up at 3am the night before an NBA game while playing WoW, when he noticed Kirilenko was online as well. Frye asked Kirilenko if he was ready for the next day&#x27;s NBA game, and Kirilenko replied &quot;Yeah, probably.&quot;

<doc id="399536" wikidata="Q186111" url="?curid=399536" title="Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani">
<text>Akbar Hashemi Bahramani Rafsanjani (25 August 19348 January 2017) was an Iranian politician and writer who served as the fourth president of Iran from 1989 to 1997. One of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic, Rafsanjani was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council.

During his 40-year tenure, Rafsanjani amassed a large amount of power serving as the speaker of parliament, Commander-in-Chief during the Iran–Iraq War, President, and chose Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader of iran.

Rafsanjani became president of Iran after winning the 1989 election. He served another term by winning the election in 1993. In the 2005 election he ran for a third term in office, placing first in the first round of elections but ultimately losing to rival Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the run-off. He and his family faced political isolation for their support of the opposition in 2009. Rafsanjani entered the race for the 2013 presidential election, but he was disqualified by the Guardian Council. With Hassan Rouhani&#x27;s election, in which Rafsanjani openly supported him, the Rafsanjani family gradually recovered their political reputation. Rafsanjani died in 2017, following a heart attack, in a hospital in Tehran at the age of 82. Although government officials attributed his death to cardiac arrest, his sudden death prompted speculation that he had been assassinated. His family strongly asserted that he had been murdered. Further investigation revealed that his body was highly radioactive.

Rafsanjani has been described as a pragmatic Islamic conservative. &quot;The Economist&quot; called him a &quot;veteran kingmaker&quot;. He supported a capitalist free market position domestically, favoring privatization of state-owned industries and a moderate position internationally, seeking to avoid conflict with the United States and the West. He was also the founder of, and one of the Board of Trustees of, Azad University. In 2003, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his personal wealth to be in excess of .

== Early life and education ==
Rafsanjani was born on 25 August 1934 in the village of Bahraman near the city of Rafsanjan in Kerman Province, to a wealthy family of pistachio farmers. He had seven siblings. His father, Mirza Ali Hashemi Behramani, was a pistachio merchant, one of Kerman&#x27;s famous businessmen. His mother, Hajie Khanom Mahbibi Hashemi, died at the age of 90 on 21 December 1995. One of his brothers, Mohammad Hashemi, is the former director of IRIB. From childhood onward Rafsanjani did not see himself as a peasant, according to family members.

He left at the age of 14 to study theology in Qom. There he became acquainted with the ideas of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the most senior dissident cleric who later became the founder of the Islamic Republic, on the political rule of the clergy. He studied theology. His other teachers were Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi, Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani, Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, Abdul-Karim Ha&#x27;eri Yazdi, Shahab al-Din Mar&#x27;ashi Najafi, Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi, Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i, and Hussein-Ali Montazeri.

== Political career ==

=== Pre-Revolution struggles ===
When he was studying at Qom Seminary, he became interested in politics under Ruhollah Khomeini. He was one of the opposers of Mohammad Reza Shah&#x27;s White Revolution and accompanied Khomeini. With Khomeini&#x27;s exile, Hashemi&#x27;s role in the fight against the Shah and representing Khomeini in the country was highlighted. This opposition eventually led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was arrested 7 times from 1960 until 1979 and was in jail for four years and 5 months in total due to his clandestine activities against the Pahlavi regime. Khomeini made him the financial manager of the revolutionary struggle as well as the bridge with other revolutionary groups.

Among the groups that had a deep bond with Hashemi, was the Islamic Coalition Party, which is known as responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansur. This communication was another reason for his arrest. In prison, he found the opportunity to become familiar with other groups opposed to the Shah. 

In the mid-1970s, Rafsanjani travelled to various countries to evaluate the position of anti-Shah resistance groups abroad, including the United States, where his brother Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani was studying. Rafsanjani travelled across sixteen states during his two-week stay, where his brother showed him locations such as Hollywood, the Statue of Liberty, and Yosemite National Park. According to Rafsanjani&#x27;s brother, a bear broke into their car at Yosemite after they ignored a sign warning visitors not to keep food in their car. Rafsanjani had previously been to the West, visiting several European countries with his wife and children. He made a habit of taking notes about these developed countries to study their living conditions, industry, and resources, in a desire to replicate the same prosperity in his home country. Upon his return to Iran, Rafsanjani was arrested by SAVAK and remained in prison until the victory of the Iranian revolution.

=== After the revolution ===
After the victory of Iranian Revolution, Rafsanjani became one of the members of Council of Islamic Revolution. He was one of the powerful members of the council from its establishment. He was also deputy interior minister at that time and later became the acting interior minister.

He was one of the 28 founders of Traditional right-wing Combatant Clergy Association and also one of the members of the central committee of Islamic Republican Party at the first years of the revolution. Years later, it was he who requested IRP&#x27;s dissolution. His political acumen and Khomeini&#x27;s full trust helped Rafsanjani as one of the most powerful politicians in Iran at that time. At the time, he was the closest person to the Khomeini and ruled as his &quot;eyes and ears&quot;. According to the &quot;Gold&quot;, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was established with the help of Rafsanjani.

Rafsanjani served as one of the Tehran&#x27;s Friday Prayer Imams (for next thirty years), Representative of Khomeini at Defense High Council (after death of Mostafa Chamran) and Second-in-Command of Iran&#x27;s Joint Chiefs of Staff in the last year of Iran–Iraq War. He forced Khomeini to accept to end the war. Only three months after his appointment as Iran&#x27;s deputy commander-in-chief, Iran accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 and eight-year war was ended.

== Chairmanship of the Parliament (1980–1989) ==

Iran&#x27;s first Election Law was developed with Rafsanjani&#x27;s partnership. He nominated as one of the Islamic Republican Party&#x27;s candidates in the 1980 legislative election in Tehran. He gained 1,151,514 (54%) votes and ranked 15. Rafsanjani was the Speaker of Parliament of Iran for 9 years. He was elected as the speaker in 1980 in the first season of Parliament after the Iranian Revolution. He was also chairman in the second season and first year of the third parliament. After the death of Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic and election of then-President Ali Khamenei as new supreme leader, he joined the 1989 presidential race and became the President, leaving Parliament.

He had a determining role in the dismissal of Abulhassan Banisadr as commander-in-chief of Iranian military and then his impeachment in the parliament as Iran&#x27;s first president in June 1981. In the summer of 1981, he protested to the veto of the parliament&#x27;s plan by the Guardian Council and informed it to Ruhollah Khomeini. This led to the establishment of Expediency Discernment Council, which later he chaired the council.
In the October 1981 presidential election, when he voted for Ali Khamenei, he described it as a vote of &quot;Imam (Khomeini), clerics and the parliament&quot;. During differences between Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Khamenei, Hashemi managed to maintain a compromise between Mousavi&#x27;s reformists and Khamenei&#x27;s principlists.

Rafsanjani had a prominent role in the Iran–Contra affair, as some participants in the affair in the US government claimed that Rafsanjani headed a &quot;moderate&quot; faction within Iran&#x27;s government that they hoped to negotiate with. Exactly what role Rafsanjani himself played in this affair remains unclear.

== Presidency (1989–1997) ==

Rafsanjani&#x27;s presidency reportedly began on 16 August 1989. adopted an &quot;economy-first&quot; policy, supporting a privatization policy against more state-owned economic tendencies in the Islamic Republic. Another source describes his administration as &quot;economically liberal, politically authoritarian, and philosophically traditional&quot; which put him in confrontation with more radical deputies in the majority in the Majles of Iran.

As president, Rafsanjani was credited with spurring Iran&#x27;s reconstruction following the 1980–88 war with Iraq. His reforms, despite attempting to curb the powers of the ultra-conservatives, failed to do so, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards received increasing power from Khamenei during his presidency. He was also accused of corruption by both conservatives and reformists, and was known for tough crackdowns on dissent.

=== Domestic policy ===
Rafsanjani advocated a free-market economy. With the state&#x27;s coffers full, Rafsanjani pursued an economic liberalization policy. Rafsanjani&#x27;s support for a deal with the United States over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and his free-market economic policies contrasted with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his allies, who advocate maintaining a hard line against Western intervention in the Middle East while pursuing a policy of economic redistribution to Iran&#x27;s poor. By espousing World Bank inspired structural adjustment policies, Rafsanjani desired a modern industrial-based economy integrated into the global economy.

Rafsanjani urged universities to cooperate with industries. Turning to the quick pace of developments in today&#x27;s world, he said that with &quot;the world constantly changing, we should adjust ourselves to the conditions of our lifetime and make decisions according to present circumstances&quot;. Among the projects he initiated are Islamic Azad University.
During his presidency, a period in which Rafsanjani is described by western media sources as having been the most powerful figure in Iran, people ordered executed by the judicial system of Iran included political dissidents, drug offenders, Communists, Kurds, followers of the Baháʼí Faith, and even Islamic clerics.

Regarding the Iranian People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, Rafsanjani said (&quot;Ettela&#x27;at&quot;, 31 October 1981):

Rafsanjani also worked with Khamenei to maintain the stability of government after the death of Khomeini.

=== Foreign policy ===

Following years of deterioration in foreign relations under Khomeini during the Iran–Iraq War, Rafsanjani sought to rebuild ties with Arab states as well as with countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. However, relations with European countries and the United States remained poor, even though Rafsanjani had a track record of handling difficult situations and defusing crises.

He condemned both the United States and Ba&#x27;athist Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. After the war he strove to renew close ties with the West, although he refused to lift Khomeini&#x27;s fatwa against the British author Salman Rushdie for his &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;.

Rafsanjani said that Iran is ready to assist Iraq, &quot;expecting nothing in return&quot;, he also said that &quot;peace and stability&quot; is a function of the &quot;evacuation of the occupiers.&quot;

Iran gave humanitarian help to the victims of the conflict. Iran sent truckloads of food and medicine to Iraq, and thousands of Kuwaiti refugees were given shelter in Iran.

Rafsanjani voiced support to Prince Abdullah&#x27;s peace initiative and to &quot;everything the Palestinians agree to&quot;. He also stated that what he called &quot;Iran&#x27;s international interests&quot; must take precedence over those of Iranian allies in Syria and Lebanon.

Ayatollah Rafsanjani was a supporter of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. In 2007 Rafsanjani reiterated that the use of weapons of mass destruction was not part of the Islamic Republic culture. Rafsanjani said: &quot;You [US and allies] are saying that you cannot trust Iran would not use its nuclear achievements in the military industries, but we are ready to give you full assurances in this respect.&quot; According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, he is regarded by many Iranians &quot;as the only person with the guile and clout to strike a deal with the West to end economic sanctions&quot; imposed upon the country due to its nuclear program.

=== Construction ===
After the end of the Iran-Iraq war, the need for a road map for the future was felt in order to end the historical gap between the country Iran development programs in the first government of Rafsanjani. The fifth government soon managed to recover the economy and moved the arrowhead of the indicators in a different direction. The first action of the fifth government was devoted to designing the first development plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The men that Rafsanjani had chosen to run the country took over the task of drafting the plan, and the first development plan was approved by the parliament at the end of 1990. The general goals of this program are rebuilding and equipping the defense base, rebuilding and modernizing production and infrastructure capacities and population centers damaged during the imposed war, quantitative expansion and qualitative improvement of public culture, creating economic growth, providing the minimum basic needs of the people, determining and modifying the pattern Consumption, organization reform and executive and judicial management of the country were considered. The most important characteristics of the two periods of Rafsanjani&#x27;s government were the developmental and building approach, the establishment of a free economy in the country, and the use of Extraterritorial jurisdiction managers and technocrats. Characteristic of the construction government was that it paid much attention to the development of industrial and transportation infrastructure.

== After the presidency ==

Post-presidency, Rafsanjani delivered a sermon at Tehran University in the summer of 1999 praising government use of force to suppress student demonstrations.

In 2000, in the first election after the end of his presidency, Rafsanjani ran again for Parliament. In the Tehran contest, Rafsanjani came in 30th, or last, place. At first, he was not among the 30 representatives of Tehran elected, as announced by the Iranian Ministry of the Interior, but the Council of Guardians then ruled numerous ballots void, leading to accusations of ballot fraud in Rafsanjani&#x27;s favor.
In December 2006, Rafsanjani was elected to the Assembly of Experts representing Tehran with more than 1.5 million votes, which was more than any other candidate. Ahmadinejad&#x27;s opponents won the majority of local election seats. On 4 September 2007 he was elected Chairman of the Assembly of Experts, the body that selects Iran&#x27;s supreme leader, in what was considered a blow to the supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He won the chairmanship with 41 votes of the 76 cast. His ultraconservative opponent, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, received 31 votes. Rafsanjani was re-elected to the position on 10 March 2009, running against Mohammad Yazdi. He received 51 votes compared to Yazdi&#x27;s 26. On 8 March 2011, he withdrew from the election and Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Mahdavi Kani was elected as his replacement.

Following his presidency, Rafsanjani also became an advocate of greater freedom of expression and tolerance in Iranian society. In a speech on 17 July 2009, Rafsanjani criticized restriction of media and suppression of activists, and put emphasis on the role and vote of people in the Islamic Republic constitution. The event has been considered by analysts as the most important and most turbulent Friday prayer in the history of contemporary Iran. Nearly 1.5 to 2.5 million people attended the speech in Tehran.

=== 2009 election protests ===
During the 2009 presidential election, Rafsanjani&#x27;s former rival and incumbent president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, won a disputed landslide victory over challenger Mir-Hossein Mousavi. His daughter was arrested on 21 June by plain clothes Basij during the subsequent protest and later sentenced to six months in jail on charges of spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic.

Ayatollah Akbar Rafsanjani was chairman of the Assembly of Experts, which is responsible for appointing or removing the Supreme Leader, who has been rumored to not be in the best of health. After the disputed results of the election were certified by the Supreme Leader, Rafsanjani was reported to have called a meeting of the Assembly of Experts, but it is unknown what the outcome or disposition of this meeting actually was. During this time Rafsanjani relocated from Tehran to Qom, where the country&#x27;s religious leaders sit. However, for the most part, Rafsanjani was silent about the controversial 12 June election and its aftermath.

On 17 July 2009, Rafsanjani publicly addressed the election crisis, mass arrests and the issue of freedom of expression during Friday prayers. The prayers witnessed an extremely large crowd that resembled the Friday prayers early after the revolution. Supporters of both reformist and conservative parties took part in the event. During prayers, Rafsanjani argued the following:
All of us the establishment, the security forces, police, parliament and even protestors should move within the framework of law... We should open the doors to debates. We should not keep so many people in prison. We should free them to take care of their families. ... It is impossible to restore public confidence overnight, but we have to let everyone speak out. ... We should have logical and brotherly discussions and our people will make their judgments. ... We should let our media write within the framework of the law and we should not impose restrictions on them. ... We should let our media even criticize us. Our security forces, our police and other organs have to guarantee such a climate for criticism.

His support for the Green Movement reinvigorated his image among the urban middle-class segments of Iranian society who made up the bulk of the movement and solidified Rafsanjani&#x27;s role as a backer of factions within Iran that advocated the reform of the system to ensure its survival.

=== Assembly of Experts election ===
On 8 March 2011 Rafsanjani lost his post as chairman of the powerful Assembly of Experts, replaced by Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani. Rafsanjani stated that he withdrew from the election for chairman to &quot;avoid division.&quot; The loss was said to be the result of intensive lobbying &quot;in recent weeks&quot; by &quot;hardliners and supporters&quot; of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and part of Rafsanjani&#x27;s gradual loss of power over the years.

=== 2013 presidential elections ===
On 11 May 2013, Rafsanjani registered for the 14 June presidential election with just minutes to spare. Former reformist president Mohammad Khatami endorsed him. However, on 21 May 2013, Iran&#x27;s electoral center, Guardian Council disqualified him from standing in the presidential election. On 11 June 2013, Rafsanjani endorsed moderate Hassan Rouhani in the elections for Iran&#x27;s presidency saying the candidate was &quot;more suitable&quot; than others for presidency.

=== Later years ===
Reformers had enjoyed his support in recent years, helping to tilt the balance of power towards more moderate forces who managed to win the presidential poll in 2013 with the victory of Hassan Rouhani and parliamentary elections in 2016.

Rafsanjani was viewed as having enough influence over Khamenei to bring moderate views into consideration. His death was therefore regarded as an event that strengthened the power of hardliners and weakened the influence of moderates.

He also kept his traditional connections with the clergy in the holy city of Qom and with conservative forces within the political establishment, which made it difficult for hardliners to form a strong front against moderate forces.

After winning reelection to his seat at Assembly of Experts as Tehran district&#x27;s first person, Rafsanjani announced that it was the last time that he joined an election as a candidate and will be retired from politics at the end of the current term. He also said &quot;Now I can die with peace of mind&quot; after seeing election of a moderate parliament in the 2016 legislative election.

== Death ==
Rafsanjani died on 8 January 2017, at 19:30 (UTC+03:30) due to a heart attack in a pool. He was brought immediately to Tajrish&#x27;s &quot;Shohada-ye Tajrish&quot; Hospital in north Tehran, as reported by Iranian state-run media. He was 82 years old at the time of his death. The government announced three days of national mourning and a public holiday on his funeral day. Black banners were raised in Tehran and other cities and some posters showed the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani together smiling. Five days of mourning also observed in the southern province of Kerman, where Ayatollah Rafsanjani&#x27;s hometown of Rafsanjan is located.

Two months after his death, a highway in Northern Tehran was renamed in his honour. Many streets in other cities also named Rafsanjani. The central building of Azad University also named as Building and a statue of him was installed outside of the building. Kerman International Airport was also renamed to Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Airport.

In 2018 Hassan Rouhani ordered the Iranian supreme national security council to reopen an investigation into Rafsanjani&#x27;s death.

== Controversies ==

=== Accusations ===
Rafsanjani was sought by the Argentinian government for ordering the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires. It was based on the allegation that senior Iranian officials planned the attack in an August 1993 meeting, including Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Hejazi, Khamenei&#x27;s intelligence and security advisor, Rafsanjani, then president, Ali Fallahian, then intelligence minister, and Ali Akbar Velayati, then foreign minister.

=== Tension with Ahmadinejad ===

After his loss at the presidential elections in 2005, a growing tension between him and President Ahmadinejad arose. Rafsanjani had criticized Ahmadinejad&#x27;s administration several times for conducting a purge of government officials, slow move towards privatization and recently hostile foreign policy in particular the atomic energy policy. In return Ahmadinejad fought back that Rafsanjani failed to differentiate privatization with the corrupt takeover of government-owned companies and of foreign policies which led to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996. He also implicitly denounced Rafsanjani and his followers by calling those who criticize his nuclear program as &quot;traitors&quot;.

During a debate with Mir-Hossein Moussavi in 2009 presidential election, Ahmadinejad accused Rafsanjani of corruption. Rafsanjani released an open letter in which he complained about what he called the president&#x27;s &quot;insults, lies and false allegations&quot; and asked the country&#x27;s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to intervene.

=== Tension with Khamenei ===
In his latter years, Rafsanjani had disagreements with Ali Khamenei who has the last say in everything in Iran. Khamenei even indirectly called Rafsanjani a traitor. Following his death, Khamanei said of Rafsanjani, &quot;I don&#x27;t know any other figure with whom I have had so many shared experiences and long history in ups and downs of this era which made history.&quot;

== Views ==

=== Political parties ===
Before Iranian Revolution, Rafsanjani was active in the anti-Shah activities and reportedly associated with the Islamic Coalition&#x27;s &quot;shura-ye ruhaniyat&quot; () and the People&#x27;s Mujahidin.

Although Rafsanjani was a member of the pragmatic-conservative Combatant Clergy Association, he had a close bond to the Executives of Construction Party and Moderation and Development Party. In 2009, Rafsanjani ceased activity in the Combatant Clergy Association, despite remaining a member.

He was regarded as flip-flopping between conservative and reformist camps since the election of Mohammad Khatami, supporting reformers in that election, but going back to the conservative camp in the 2000 parliamentary elections as a result of the reformist party severely criticizing and refusing to accept him as their candidate. Reformists, including Akbar Ganji, accused him of involvement in murdering dissidents and writers during his presidency. In the end, the major differences between the Kargozaran and the reformists party weakened both and eventually resulted in their loss at the presidential elections in 2005. However, Rafsanjani regained close ties with the reformers since he lost the 2005 presidential elections to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

== Electoral history ==


== Personal life ==

From his marriage to Effat Marashi in 1958, Rafsanjani had three sons: Mohsen, Mehdi, and Yasser, as well as two daughters, Fatemeh and Faezeh. Only Faezeh Hashemi chose a political life, which led to her becoming a Majlis representative and then the publisher of the weekly newspaper &quot;Zan&quot; (meaning &quot;Woman&quot; in English), which was closed in February 1999. In 2016, his daughter, Faezeh Hashemi, sparked a debate on religious persecution in Iran by visiting the female leader of the persecuted Baháʼí religious minority. The two women had met in prison, when Faezeh was serving a six-month sentence for &quot;spreading propaganda against the system&quot;. Rafsanjani&#x27;s daughter, Fatemeh is President of Charity Foundation for Special Diseases and Mohsen was chairman of Tehran Metro Organization and now is vice president of Azad University. His wife, Effat is the granddaughter of Mohammed Kazem Yazdi.

=== Family tree ===

=== Assets ===
The Rafsanjani family took their name from his great grandfather, whose last name was Hashem. When Akbar Hashemi was born, his father was a rich businessman with a valuable pistachio business.

Hashemi and his partners also owned Islamic Azad University, worth an estimated .

Rafsanjani&#x27;s three sons own properties in Dubai, including two apartments in the Burj Khalifa.

=== Assassination attempts ===

Months after the revolution, Rafsanjani was shot once in the stomach by one of the groups vying for power amid the political turmoil. He was not seriously wounded, and neither was his wife who jumped in front to shield him from the attack. &quot;Great men of history do not die&quot;, Khomeini said in announcing that Rafsanjani had survived.

*Encyclopedia of Quran (Farhang-e-Quran)
The book in fact considered as a key to the subjects and concepts of Quran. The book has been written by Rafsanjani and several other scholars. Reception and legacy

Although he was a close follower of Ayatollah Khomeini and considered as a central elite during Islamic revolution, at the same time he was fan of reconstruction of shattered country after war and according to this fact, he selected his cabinets from western-educated technocrats and social reformers. His cabinet largely was a reformist one. Rafsanjani acquired both the support of Imam Khomeini in one hand and Majlis in other hand. In fact, he tried to transfer the economy towards the free-market system. There was a gap among Rafsanjani and Khatami and reform agenda because of his partnership with those who were conservative. The first face of reformist movements began by Rafsanjani. His powerful role and control over Iranian politics earned him the name &quot;Akbar Shah&quot;.

<text>St. Paul Academy and Summit School is a private college preparatory day school in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, for students in grades K–12.

The school was established through a merger in 1969 of St. Paul Academy, a school for boys, and Summit School, a school for girls. St. Paul Academy was founded in 1900 and Summit School in 1917. Accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Central States, SPA is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools, the Cum Laude Society, and The College Board.

Recent commencement speakers have included Al Franken, Wilhelmina Wright, Coretta Scott King, and Garrison Keillor.

==Academics==

In the Upper School (grades 9–12), SPA has a college-preparatory liberal arts curriculum. SPA teaches an independent curriculum that does not follow either the AP or IB curriculum models, though individual students may opt to take AP tests. Courses have been taught using Harkness tables, distinctive elliptical wooden tables that seat 12–15 students, since 2005.

==Athletics==

The school mascot is a Spartan, and the school&#x27;s main rivals are Breck School, Blake School and Minnehaha Academy. SPA offers 15 varsity sports, and 34 teams.

===Hockey===
SPA has the oldest varsity hockey squad in the state of Minnesota. The first official team was recorded in 1905. The opponents the team faced during the early years included local colleges St. Thomas as well as the University of Minnesota, which did not field a varsity team until a few years after the academy. The hockey team has won five Minnesota Independent School League (MISL) championships, in 1941, 1942, 1961, 1962, and 1974.

==Campuses==
The school consists of two campuses: the Goodrich Campus and the Randolph Campus.
*The Goodrich Campus, site of the old Summit School for girls, is the current home of the Lower School (grades K–5, ~290 students) and contains the Sarah Converse Auditorium, formerly the home of SPA theater productions. It is located at 1150 Goodrich Avenue.
*The Randolph Campus, site of the old St. Paul Academy for boys, is the current home of the Middle School (grades 6–8, ~240 students) as well as the Upper School (grades 9–12, ~380 students). Drake hockey arena, the Harry M. Drake Gallery, and the Huss Center for the Performing Arts are located on this campus, 1712 Randolph Avenue.
School hours are from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., (8:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesdays), with exceptions for after-school activities.

==Academic teams==
SPA currently has a Quiz Bowl team, which is registered with NAQT and participates in the Minnesota High School Quiz Bowl&#x27;s East Division. SPA sent its A team to the NAQT High School National Championship Tournament in 2014, and both its A and B team in 2015 and 2016. They have continued to send teams in the past years, with one team going in 2017 and 2018. They also have competitive math, chess, debate and science teams. As of the 2014–2015 debate season, the debate team has made the Minnesota State High School Debate Tournament 14 straight years and 17 out of the last 18 years.

<text>Cutlery (also referred to as silverware, flatware, or tableware) includes any hand implement used in preparing, serving, and especially eating food in Western culture. A person who makes or sells cutlery is called a cutler. While most cutlers were historically men, women could be cutlers too; Agnes Cotiller was working as a cutler in London in 1346, and training a woman apprentice, known as Juseana. 

The city of Sheffield in England has been famous for the production of cutlery since the 17th century and a train – the &quot;Master Cutler&quot; – running from Sheffield to London was named after the industry. Bringing affordable cutlery to the masses, stainless steel was developed in Sheffield in the early 20th century.

The major items of cutlery in Western culture are the knife, fork and spoon. These three implements first appeared together on tables in Britain in the Georgian era. In recent times, hybrid versions of cutlery have been made combining the functionality of different eating implements, including the spork (&#x27;oon / f&#x27;), spife (&#x27;oon / kn&#x27;), and knork (&#x27;ife / f&#x27;). The sporf or splayd combines all three.

==Etymology==
The word cutler derives from the Middle English word &#x27;cuteler&#x27; and this in turn derives from Old French &#x27;coutelier&#x27; which comes from &#x27;coutel&#x27;; meaning knife (modern French: couteau). The word&#x27;s early origins can be seen in the Latin word &#x27;culter&#x27; (knife).

==Composition==
=== Metallic ===
Sterling silver is the traditional material from which good quality cutlery is made. Historically, silver had the advantage over other metals of being less chemically reactive. Chemical reactions between certain foods and the cutlery metal can lead to unpleasant tastes. Gold is even less reactive than silver, but the use of gold cutlery was confined to the exceptionally wealthy, such as monarchs.

Steel was always used for more utilitarian knives, and pewter was used for some cheaper items, especially spoons. From the nineteenth century, electroplated nickel silver (EPNS) was used as a cheaper substitute for sterling silver.

In 1913, the British metallurgist Harry Brearley discovered stainless steel by chance, bringing affordable cutlery to the masses. This metal has come to be the predominant one used in cutlery. An alternative is melchior, corrosion-resistant nickel and copper alloy, which can also sometimes contain manganese and nickel-iron.

Titanium has also been used to make cutlery for its lower thermal conductivity and weight savings compared to steel, with uses in camping.

=== Plastic ===
Plastic cutlery is made for disposable use, and is frequently used outdoors for camping, excursions, and barbecues for instance. Plastic cutlery is also commonly used at fast-food or take-away outlets and provided with airline meals in economy class.
Plastic is also used for children&#x27;s cutlery. It is often thicker and more durable than disposable plastic cutlery.

=== Wooden ===
Wooden disposable cutlery is available as a popular biodegradable alternative. Bamboo (although not a wood) and maple are popular choices.

=== Edible ===
Edible cutlery is made from dried grains. These are made primarily with rice, millets or wheat. Since rice cultivation needs a lot of water, manufacturers market millet based products as more environment friendly. The batter is baked in moulds which hardens it. Some manufacturers offer an option of flavoured cutlery. Edible cutlery decomposes in about a week if disposed.

==Industry==

At Sheffield the trade of cutler became divided, with allied trades such as razormaker, awl bladesmith, shearsmith and forkmaker emerging and becoming distinct trades by the 18th century.

Before the mid 19th century when cheap mild steel became available due to new methods of steelmaking, knives (and other edged tools) were made by welding a strip of steel on to the piece of iron that was to be formed into a knife, or sandwiching a strip of steel between two pieces of iron. This was done because steel was then a much more expensive commodity than iron. Modern blades are sometimes laminated, but for a different reason. Since the hardest steel is brittle, a layer of hard steel may be laid between two layers of a milder, less brittle steel, for a blade that keeps a sharp edge well, and is less likely to break in service.

After fabrication, the knife had to be sharpened, originally on a grindstone, but from the late medieval period in a blade mill or (as they were known in the Sheffield region) a cutlers wheel.

=== Disposable cutlery ===

==== Plastic ====

Introduced for convenience purposes (lightweight, no cleanup after the meal required), disposable cutlery made of plastic has become a huge worldwide market. Along with other disposable tableware (paper plates, plastic table covers, disposable cups, paper napkins, etc.), these products have become essential for the fast food and catering industry. The products are emblematic of throw-away societies and the cause of millions of tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste. The European Union has banned such plastic products from 3 July 2021 as part of the European Plastics Strategy. Bans are also planned in the UK and Canada.

==== Wooden ====
As an ecofriendly alternative to non-degradable plastic, wooden cutlery is gaining popularity. Some manufacturers coat their products in food-safe plant oils, waxes and lemon juice for a longer shelf life making these safe for human use. Cutlery is then cured for a few days before leaving the manufacturing plant.

==Manufacturing centres==

Traditional centres of cutlery-making include:
* Caldas das Taipas in Portugal
* Albacete in Spain
* Meriden and Oneida in United States of America
* Premana in Italy
* Sheffield in the United Kingdom
* Solingen in Germany
* Seki and Sakai in Japan
* Styria in Austria
* Thiers and Laguiole in France
* Toledo in Spain
* Wazirabad in Pakistan
* Galway in Ireland
* Carlos Barbosa in Brazil

<doc id="399557" wikidata="Q310592" url="?curid=399557" title="Mohammad-Ali Rajai">
<text>Mohammad-Ali Rajai (; 15 June 1933 – 30 August 1981) was an Iranian politician who served as the second president of Iran from 2 August 1981 until his assassination four weeks later. Before his presidency, Rajai had served as prime minister under Abolhassan Banisadr, while concurrently occupying the position of foreign affairs minister from 11 March 1981 to 15 August 1981. He died in a bombing on 30 August 1981 along with then-prime minister Mohammad-Javad Bahonar.

==Early life and education==

Mohammad-Ali Rajai was born on 15 June 1933 in Qazvin, Iran. His father, a shopkeeper named Abdolsamad, died when he was four years old. Rajai grew up in Qazvin and moved to Tehran in the late 1940s. He joined the Air Force at age sixteen or seventeen. In 1959, he graduated from Tarbiat Moallem University with a degree in education, later working as a teacher of mathematics.

==Political career==
After moving to Tehran, Rajai became involved in the anti-Shah movement and associated with Mahmoud Taleghani and the Fadayeen-e Islam group. A one-time member of the largely anti-clerical People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), Rajai soon came out against its left-leaning ideals and in 1960, joined the Freedom Movement of Iran. He was arrested at least twice by SAVAK for his opposition activities, with his longest detention lasting from May 1974 to late 1978. Later in a 1980 speech to the United Nations Security Council, Rajai displayed his beaten right foot to the audience, attributing its condition to being tortured by the Shah&#x27;s interrogators in prison.

Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Rajai left the Freedom Movement and was appointed the minister of education in an Interim Government led by Mehdi Bazargan. Using his newfound power, Rajai sought the rapid Islamization of Iranian schools by banning the teaching of English, removing courses thought to be &quot;non-Islamic&quot;, closing universities to prevent potential student dissent, and firing teachers with whom he disagreed.

Although the Interim Government of Iran resigned on 6 November 1979 as a result of the Iran hostage crisis, Rajai remained in his post until 12 August 1980, when he was appointed prime minister by newly-elected president Abolhassan Banisadr, who was under pressure from the dominant Islamic Republican Party. Rajai set up his cabinet by selecting Karim Khodapanahi as foreign affairs minister, Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani as interior minister, and Javad Fakoori as defense minister. Just a month into Rajai&#x27;s premiership on 22 September 1980, the Iran–Iraq War began.

===Presidency===
Banisadr was impeached on 21 June 1981 by the Iranian Parliament, allegedly because of his moves against the clerics in power. Ruhollah Khomeini, acting as Supreme Leader, held a Provisional Presidential Council of six people headed by Mohammad Beheshti and later Abdolkarim Mousavi Ardebili. Rajai, a member of the Council, nominated himself for the presidential election in 1981, running as a member of the Islamic Republican Party. By winning 91% of the votes, Rajai officially became the president after taking the Oath of Office on 2 August 1981. In one of his first acts in office, he named Mohammad-Javad Bahonar to become the next prime minister of Iran.

==Assassination==
On 30 August 1981, Rajai held a meeting of Iran&#x27;s Supreme Defence Council along with Bahonar. Witnesses later stated that a trusted aide brought a briefcase into the conference room, set it between the two leaders, and then left. A short period later, another person opened the case, triggering a hidden bomb that set the room ablaze, leading to the deaths of Rajai, Bahonar, and six other officials. The attack occurred two months after the Haft-e Tir bombing. Iranian officials identified MEK operative Massoud Keshmiri as the culprit, though others allege the bombing was by political rivals within Rajai&#x27;s political party. He is buried in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.

==Political positions==
Rajai&#x27;s political programs were based on a form of constitutional law that included a position of privilege for Islam. He insisted that those in control of the state must be Muslim, emphasized the &quot;Velayat-e Faqih,&quot; and believed it essential that the government cooperate with institutions such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and Islamic Revolutionary Court. He respected people&#x27;s freedom insofar as it did not contravene Islamic law and tried during his tenure to create a consistent government.

<doc id="399563" wikidata="Q502382" url="?curid=399563" title="Andrei Kirilenko (politician)">
<text>Andrei Pavlovich Kirilenko (; , ; – 12 May 1990) was a Soviet politician, and a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was one of the most loyal politicians to Leonid Brezhnev.

His role in the CPSU was to ensure Brezhnev&#x27;s power base and, if possible, to strengthen Brezhnev&#x27;s position within the party. In order to accomplish this task, he emerged as one of the leading figures in the Secretariat under Brezhnev&#x27;s rule.

==Early life and career==
Andrei Kirilenko was born on 8 September 1906 in the village of Alexeyevka, Belgorod Oblast, in the Russian Empire, to a working-class family. As a young boy, he worked as an electrician and a locksmith. In 1920, Kirilenko graduated from one of the local schools; five years later, he graduated from the Alekseevskii vocational technical school. In the mid-to-late 1920s, Kirilenko started working for a mining enterprise located in the Voronezh Oblast. He became an active member of Komsomol in 1929 and, two years later, became a member of the All-Union Communist Party. In 1936, he graduated from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute. He started working as a design engineer for the aircraft factory, Zaporizhia Engine Plant. In 1938, Kirilenko became an active participant in party politics and was eventually selected to the position of Second Secretary of the Voroshilov District Party Committee in Zaporozhye Oblast. The following year, he was voted in as First Secretary. Later that year he was appointed to Second Secretary of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Party Committee of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In this role, Kirilenko made significant contributions to the development of metallurgical and electrical engineering, but also other sorts of industry.

During the Great Patriotic War, Kirilenko was directly involved with evacuating industry to safe zones. From 1941 to 1943, he was a member of the Military Soviet of the 18th Army of the Southern Front. He contributed by improving discipline among soldiers as well as improving the materiel support for the troops. In 1943, Kirilenko was relocated to Moscow, and during his stay there the production of advanced aircraft increased rapidly. By the end of the war, in 1944, Kirilenko was made First Secretary of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Party. He succeeded Leonid Brezhnev, future Soviet leader, as First Secretary of the Dnepropetrovsk Regional Party Committee. From 1955 to 1962, he was First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee; he was appointed by Nikita Khrushchev himself to take charge of economic planning and personnel selection in urban areas of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Kirilenko was later promoted to Khrushchev&#x27;s vice-chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee. Brezhnev benefited from Kirilenko&#x27;s position, Brezhnev used him to win over supporters of his conspiracy against Khrushchev.

==Brezhnev era==
===Rise to prominence===
Immediately after Khrushchev&#x27;s ouster, a &quot;collective leadership&quot; had been formed with Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as head of government and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. Central Committee Secretaries Mikhail Suslov and Kirilenko were also a part of the collective leadership, with Kirilenko ranked fifth behind Brezhnev, Podgorny, Kosygin, and Suslov. In 1962, Kirilenko became a voting member of the Political Bureau (Politburo). In 1966, the Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSFSR was abolished, and Kirilenko became Brezhnev&#x27;s chief lieutenant. Vadim Medvedev, a Soviet official, said Kirilenko&#x27;s chief concern was maintaining and strengthening Brezhnev&#x27;s position within the Party. Men who were loyal to Brezhnev were also loyal to Kirilenko.

Konstantin Chernenko, another old Brezhnev protégé, became a &quot;counterweight&quot; to Kirilenko&#x27;s power within the Central Committee (CC). Before Chernenko&#x27;s rise in the Soviet hierarchy, Kirilenko provided detailed supervision of new party personnel and the economy. When Chernenko came on board in 1976, Kirilenko supervised the economy. By the mid-to-late 1970s, Kirilenko&#x27;s health was beginning to decline, and his memory weakened. Despite his failing health, he was still a high-standing member, and he usually presided over the meetings of the Secretariat when Suslov was not around. While First World representatives treated Kirilenko as Second Secretary of the Communist Party because most of his duties had been associated with that office in the past, the position was actually held by Suslov. During most of his term, Kirilenko was one of four who had both a seat in the secretariat and Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Suslov and Fyodor Kulakov.

By 1976 Kirilenko&#x27;s position within the Soviet leadership had grown to such an extent that leading officials, such as Brezhnev and Suslov, were beginning to worry about his &quot;organisational tail&quot; in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). His supervisory responsibilities led many of his colleagues to view him as a threat to the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee – the Central Committee department overseeing the civilian economy and the military–industrial complex. His position was weakened drastically by the end of the year, his weakened position did not lead to a strengthening of the Collective leadership but to the weakening of it.

===Later career and resignation===
As with Kosygin, Kirilenko&#x27;s leading position in the Soviet leadership was in &quot;limbo&quot; due to his support for economic reform to countenance the country&#x27;s stagnating economy. Kirilenko grew increasingly estranged with Brezhnev in 1977, some believe that it was due to the growing economic hardship that faced the Soviet Union. It is said that the two argued over resource allocation and on how to modernise the ailing economy. However, the most common explanation is that Kirilenko grew estranged was because of his weakened position within the Collective leadership.

Kirilenko led the Soviet delegation to the December 1977 MPLA Party Congress. At this congress, MPLA officially subscribed to the doctrine of Marxist-Leninism. This congress was important to the Soviet Union, and Kirilenko compared Angola&#x27;s development with that of Vietnam. Kirilenko, along with Premier Kosygin, had been one of the most vocal opponents to a Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. He blamed the Afghan Party leadership for the rebellion against them, claiming that the Soviets &quot;gave them everything.&quot; He also disliked it when the Afghan leadership tried to justify their murderous actions on the grounds that Vladimir Lenin also did it.

Kirilenko was seen as a possible candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasily Kuznetsov, first deputy minister of foreign affairs, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev&#x27;s later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko&#x27;s position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protégé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev&#x27;s death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov&#x27;s attacks. After Brezhnev&#x27;s death and funeral, Kirilenko&#x27;s mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko&#x27;s son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.

==Later life, death, and recognition==
When compared to other Soviet politicians who shared the same fate, Kirilenko&#x27;s downfall was, in the words of historian R. Judson Mitchell, a &quot;relatively easy&quot; fall from power. At Brezhnev&#x27;s lying-in-state and subsequent funeral, he was allowed to stand besides Brezhnev&#x27;s family even though he was not a member of the Soviet leadership at the time. Kirilenko made his last public appearance in 1983, and was given an honorary retirement the same year. Mitchell believes that Andropov gave Kirilenko the honorary retirement so that he could win over Kirilenko&#x27;s &quot;organisational tail&quot;, literally Kirilenko&#x27;s appointees to top-ranking offices during his years in service. He lived the rest of his life in Moscow and died on 12 May 1990 at age 83 and was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

==Awards and honors==
During his lifetime, he was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour twice, and he received seven Orders of Lenin and one Order of the October Revolution.

<doc id="399571" wikidata="Q273866" url="?curid=399571" title="Abolhassan Banisadr">
<text>Abolhassan Banisadr (; 22 March 1933 – 9 October 2021) was an Iranian politician, writer, and political dissident. He was the first president of Iran after the 1979 Iranian Revolution abolished the monarchy, serving from February 1980 until his impeachment by parliament in June 1981. Prior to his presidency, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Interim Government.

Following his impeachment, Banisadr fled Iran and found political asylum in France, where he co-founded the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Banisadr later focused on political writings about his revolutionary activities and his critiques of the Iranian government. He became a critic of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the country&#x27;s handling of its 2009 elections.

==Early life and education==
Banisadr was born on 22 March 1933 in Baghcheh, a small village north of Hamedan. His father, Nasrollah, was a Shia cleric who had originally migrated to the area from Bijar, Kurdistan. As a student, Banisadr studied law, theology, and sociology at the University of Tehran. He participated in the anti-Shah student movement during the early 1960s, which led to his being imprisoned twice and wounded during the 1963 uprising. Soon after, due to his political activities, Banisadr fled to France, where he studied finance and economics at the Sorbonne. He wrote a book on Islamic finance, &quot;Eghtesad Tohidi,&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;The Economics of Monotheism.&quot; 

In 1972, Banisadr&#x27;s father died and it was at the funeral in Iraq where he first became acquainted with Ruhollah Khomeini. He later joined the Iranian resistance group led by Khomeini, becoming one of his most fervent advisors. On 1 February 1979, with the end of the Iranian Revolution drawing near, Banisadr returned to the country together with Khomeini.

==Career==
With the Interim Government controlling Iran, Banisadr was appointed Deputy Minister of Finance on 4 February 1979. At the direction of Khomeini, he also became a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution, taking the seat of Mehdi Bazargan, who left to become prime minister. On 12 November 1979, following the Interim Government of Iran dissolution, Banisadr was appointed by the Council to replace Ebrahim Yazdi as Minister of Foreign Affairs. That same month, on 17 November, Banisadr was promoted to Minister of Finance, replacing the outgoing Ali Ardalan. 

In January 1980, Banisadr registered to become a candidate for Iran&#x27;s newly formed presidential office. He was not an Islamic cleric; Khomeini, who was by then the Supreme Leader of Iran with a constitutional authority to dismiss politicians, had insisted that members of the clergy not run for positions in the government. On 25 January 1980, Banisadr was elected to a four-year term as president, receiving 78.9 percent of the vote. Inaugural ceremonies took place on 4 February at a hospital where Khomeini was recuperating from a heart ailment. 

In August and September 1980, Banisadr survived two helicopter crashes near the Iran–Iraq border. During the Iran–Iraq War, Banisadr was made acting commander-in-chief by Khomeini on 10 June 1981.

===Impeachment===
The Majlis (Iranian Parliament) impeached Banisadr in his absence on 21 June 1981, allegedly because of his moves against the clerics in power, in particular Mohammad Beheshti, then head of the judicial system. Khomeini himself appears to have instigated the impeachment, which he signed the next day. According to historian Kenneth Katzman, Banisadr believed the clerics should not directly govern Iran and was perceived as supporting the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). Only one deputy, Salaheddin Bayani, spoke in favor of Banisadr during his impeachment. Banisadr called for a referendum, arguing that the people should have the right to choose, and pointing out that he had received over 10 million votes in the presidential election while the IRP had received less than 4 million in the parliamentary elections.

Even before Khomeini signed the articles of impeachment, the Revolutionary Guard had seized presidential buildings and imprisoned writers at a newspaper closely tied to Banisadr. Over the next few days, the government executed several of Banisadr&#x27;s closest friends and advisors, in addition to hundreds of revolutionaries deemed unsympathetic to the regime. Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri was among the few people in the government who remained in support of Banisadr, but he was later stripped of his powers.

Banisadr had gone into hiding in Tehran for a few days before his removal, assisted by the MEK. There, he attempted to organize an alliance of anti-Khomeini factions to retake power, including the MEK, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and the Fedaian Organisation (Minority), while eschewing any contact with monarchist exile groups. He met numerous times while hiding with MEK leader Massoud Rajavi to plan an alliance. However, after the execution on 27 July 1981 of prominent MEK member Mohammad Reza Saadati, Banisadr and Rajavi concluded that it was unsafe to remain in Iran.

==Flight and exile==
On 29 July 1981, Banisadr and Rajavi were smuggled aboard an Iranian Air Force Boeing 707 piloted by Colonel Behzad Moezzi. It followed a routine flight plan before deviating out of Iranian groundspace to Turkish airspace and eventually landing in Paris. As a disguise, Banisadr shaved his eyebrows and mustache and dressed in a skirt.

Banisadr and Rajavi found political asylum in Paris, conditional on abstaining from anti-Khomeini activities in France. This restriction was effectively ignored after France evacuated its embassy in Tehran. Banisadr, Rajavi, and the Kurdish Democratic Party established the National Council of Resistance of Iran in Paris in October 1981. By 1984, however, Banisadr had fallen out with Rajavi, accusing him of ideologies favoring dictatorship and violence. Furthermore, Banisadr opposed the armed opposition as initiated and sustained by Rajavi and instead sought support for Iran during the war with Iraq.

===&quot;My Turn to Speak&quot;===
In 1991, Banisadr released an English translation of his 1989 text &quot;My Turn to Speak: Iran, the Revolution and Secret Deals with the U.S.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foreign Affairs; Winter 1991/92&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Banisadr alleged covert dealings between the Ronald Reagan presidential campaign and leaders in Tehran to prolong the Iran hostage crisis before the 1980 United States presidential election. He also claimed that Henry Kissinger plotted to set up a Palestinian state in the Iranian province of Khuzestan and that Zbigniew Brzezinski conspired with Saddam Hussein to plot Iraq&#x27;s 1980 invasion of Iran.

Lloyd Grove of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The book is not what normally passes for a bestseller. Cobbled together from a series of interviews conducted by French journalist Jean-Charles Deniau, it is never merely direct when it can be enigmatic, never just simple when it can be labyrinthine.&quot; In a review for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, William B. Quandt described the book as &quot;a rambling, self-serving series of reminiscences&quot; and &quot;long on sensational allegations and devoid of documentation that might lend credence to Bani-Sadr&#x27;s claims.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;an interesting—though frequently incredible and consistently self-serving-memoir&quot; and said &quot;frequent sensational accusations render his tale an eccentric, implausible commentary on the tragic folly of the Iranian Revolution.&quot;

===Views===

In 1980, Banisadr openly criticized the Iran hostage crisis, arguing that the ordeal was isolating Iran from the Third World and forming &quot;a state within a state&quot;.

In a 2008 interview with the Voice of America, Banisadr claimed that Khomeini was directly responsible for the violence originating from the Muslim world and that the promises Khomeini made in exile were broken after the revolution. In July 2009, Banisadr publicly denounced the Iranian government&#x27;s conduct after the disputed presidential election by alleging that &quot;Khamenei ordered the fraud in the presidential elections and the ensuing crackdown on protesters.&quot; In addition, Banisadr said the government was &quot;holding on to power solely by means of violence and terror&quot;, and accused its leaders of amassing individual wealth to the detriment of other Iranians.

In published articles on the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, Banisadr ascribed the unusually open political climate before the election to the government&#x27;s great need to prove its legitimacy, which he said was lost. He further stated that the spontaneous uprising had cost the government its political legitimacy, and that Khamenei&#x27;s threats led to the violent crackdown, which also cost the government its religious legitimacy.

==Personal life and death==
Beginning in 1981, Banisadr lived in Versailles, near Paris, in a villa closely guarded by French police. Banisadr&#x27;s daughter, Firouzé, married Massoud Rajavi in Paris following their exile. They later divorced, and the alliance between him and Rajavi also ended.

After a long illness, Banisadr died at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris on 9 October 2021, at age 88. He is buried in Versailles, in the cemetery of Gonards.

<text>Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov (; 25 January 1982) was a Soviet statesman during the Cold War. He served as Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1965, and as unofficial chief ideologue of the party until his death in 1982. Suslov was responsible for party democracy and power separation within the Communist Party. His hardline attitude resisting change made him one of the foremost orthodox communist Soviet leaders.

Born in rural Russia in 1902, Suslov became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied economics for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression begun by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime. He was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area in 1939. During World War II, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement.

After the war, Suslov became a member of the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946. In June 1950, he was elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. From 16 October 1952 onwards, he was a full member of the 19th Presidium of the CPSU. In the ensuing shuffle of the Soviet leadership following Stalin&#x27;s death, Suslov lost much of the recognition and influence he had previously earned. However, by the late 1950s, he had risen to become the leader of the party opposition to First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. When Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Suslov supported the establishment of a collective leadership. He also supported inner-party democracy and opposed the reestablishment of the one-man rule as seen during the Stalin and Khrushchev eras. During the Brezhnev era, Suslov was considered to be the party&#x27;s chief ideologue and second-in-command. His death on 25 January 1982 is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary.

==Early years and career==
Suslov was born in Shakhovskoye, Khvalynsky Uyezd, Saratov Governorate (today, a rural locality in Pavlovsky District, Ulyanovsk Oblast), Russian Empire on 21 November 1902. Suslov began work in the local Komsomol organisation in Saratov in 1918, eventually becoming a member of the Poverty Relief Committee. After working in the Komsomol for nearly three years, Suslov became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (the Bolsheviks) in 1921. After graduating from the &quot;rabfak&quot;, he studied economics at the Plekhanov Institute of National Economy between 1924 and 1928. In the summer of 1928, after graduating from the Plekhanov institute, he became a graduate student (research fellow) in economics at the Institute of Red Professors, teaching at Moscow State University and at the Industrial Academy.

In 1931, he abandoned teaching in favour of the party apparatus. He became an inspector on the Communist Party&#x27;s Party Control Commission and on the People&#x27;s Commissariat of the Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Inspectorate. His main task there was to adjudicate large numbers of &quot;personal cases&quot;, breaches of discipline, and appeals against expulsion from the party.

In 1933 and 1934, Suslov directed a commission charged with purging the party in the Ural and Chernigov provinces. The purge was organised by Lazar Kaganovich, then Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission. Author Yuri Druzhnikov contends that Suslov was involved with setting up several show trials, and contributed to the Party by expelling all members deviating from the Party line, meaning Trotskyists, Zinovievists, and other left-wing deviationists.

From 1936 to 1937, Suslov studied at the Postgraduate Course of the Economic Institute of Red Professors. He gained a reputation as an unsociable, modest, and serious student who carefully studied and memorized the works and speeches of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and became known for keeping a complete record of their statements on economic and political issues in boxes of cards and file cabinets in his tiny room in a communal apartment. Somehow, Stalin urgently needed Lenin&#x27;s opinion on one narrow economic issue and dispatched his secretary Lev Mekhlis to locate the answer. Mekhlis, Suslov&#x27;s classmate at the institute, approached him and instantly found the necessary quote. An amazed Stalin asked how he managed to find the quote so quickly, upon which Mekhlis introduced Stalin to Suslov. Stalin immediately had Suslov promoted to a secretary of the Rostov Regional Committee in 1937. Suslov has been linked to political repression in Rostov as part of the Great Purge in 1938, however writer Roy Medvedev has questioned this, stating that &quot;we have no evidence of his personal involvement in the repressive campaigns of 1937–1938, though they certainly paved the way for his rapid rise.&quot; Suslov was made First Secretary of the Stavropol Krai Committee in 1939.

===Wartime activities (1941–1945)===

On the Eastern Front in World War II, Suslov was a member of Military Council of the North Caucasian Front and led the Stavropol Krai Headquarters of the Partisan Divisions (the local guerrilla movement) after the Germans occupied the area. Suslov spent much of his time mobilising workers to fight against the German invaders. The guerrilla movement he led was operated by the regional party cells; Suslov for his part maintained close contact with the Red Army. Suslov also supervised the deportations of Chechens and other Muslim minorities from the Caucasus during the war.

According to Soviet historiography, Suslov&#x27;s years as a guerrilla fighter were highly successful; however, testimonies from participants differ from the official account. These participants claim that there were a number of organizational problems which reduced their effectiveness on the battlefield. Suslov also suffered badly from tuberculosis, which he had contracted in his youth, that was further exacerbated in the dense partisan forests and hampered his ability as an effective combatant. Fearing further relapses, for the rest of his life, he continued to wear galoshes on his shoes as well as a hat and raincoat at all times, even in the hot summer weather, which made him the subject of jokes among his colleagues in Brezhnev&#x27;s Politburo.

Suslov later purged the Baltic region in the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War. From 1944 to 1946, he chaired the Central Committee Bureau for Lithuanian Affairs. Anti-Soviet samizdat literature from the height of his power in the 1970s would accuse him of being personally responsible for the deportation and killings of nationalist Lithuanians who became political opponents of the Soviets during the course of Soviet re-entry into the Baltic states on their drive to Berlin in 1944.

===Stalin&#x27;s protégé===

In 1946, Suslov was made a member of the Orgburo and immediately became the Head of the Foreign Policy Department of the Central Committee. Within a year, Suslov was appointed Head of the Central Committee Department for Agitation and Propaganda. He also became a harsh critic of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the post-war years. On 26 November 1946, Suslov sent a letter to Andrei Zhdanov, accusing the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee of spying. Suslov&#x27;s letter, which was well-received among Soviet leadership, would serve as the basis for prosecution of the committee during the anti-cosmopolitan campaign. After becoming head of the Agitprop, at the height of the anti-cosmopolitan campaign, Suslov also purged Jews from media and public institutions.
In 1947, Suslov was transferred to Moscow and elected to the Central Committee Secretariat; he would retain this seat for the rest of his life. Suslov had the full confidence of Stalin and in 1948 he was entrusted with the task of speaking on behalf of the Central Committee before a solemn meeting on the twenty-fourth anniversary of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s death. From September 1949 to 1950, he was editor-in-chief of the central Party daily &quot;Pravda&quot;.

In 1949, Suslov became a member, along with Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, and Lazar Kaganovich, of a commission created to investigate charges levied against Moscow&#x27;s local Communist Party First Secretary, Georgy Popov. Russian historian Roy Medvedev speculates in his book, &quot;Neizvestnyi Stalin&quot;, that Stalin had made Suslov his &quot;secret heir&quot;. Lavrentiy Beria, who hated Suslov, evidently felt so threatened by him that after his arrest, documents were found in Beria&#x27;s safe labeling Suslov as the No. 1 person he wanted to &quot;eliminate&quot;.

In June 1950, Suslov was elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. He was promoted to the CPSU Presidium (later known as the Politburo) in 1952 following the 19th Party Congress. He suffered a temporary reversal when Stalin died and was dismissed from the Presidium in 1953. He continued to work in the Supreme Soviet, even becoming Chairman of the Commission of Foreign Affairs in the years immediately following Stalin&#x27;s death.

==Khrushchev era==

Suslov recovered his authority in 1955 and was elected to a seat in the Presidium, bypassing the customary candidate membership. In the 20th Party Congress of 1956, Khrushchev delivered the famous Secret Speech about Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality. In Suslov&#x27;s ideological report on 16 February, he updated his criticism of Stalin and his personality cult:

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Suslov, along with Anastas Mikoyan, operated in close proximity to Budapest in order to direct the activities of the Soviet troops and to lend assistance to the new Hungarian leadership. Suslov and Mikoyan attended the Politburo meeting of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party which elected János Kádár to the office of General Secretary. In a telegram to the Soviet leadership, Suslov and Mikoyan acknowledged that the situation had become more dire, but both were content with the dismissal of Ernő Gerő as General Secretary and the choice of Kádár as his successor.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet criticised Suslov&#x27;s and Mikoyan&#x27;s concessions to the new government in the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary. Despite his initial reservations, Suslov eventually supported the Presidium&#x27;s decision to intervene in Hungary militarily and replace the government&#x27;s leadership there.

In June 1957, Suslov backed Khrushchev during his struggle with the Anti-Party Group led by Georgy Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Dmitry Shepilov. Mikoyan later wrote in his memoirs that he convinced Suslov to support Khrushchev by telling him that Khrushchev would emerge the winner even if he did not have enough support in the Presidium.

The following October Suslov accused Georgy Zhukov, the Minister of Defence, of &quot;Bonapartism&quot; at the Central Committee plenum that removed him from all party and government posts. The removal of Zhukov had the effect of firmly subordinating the armed forces to party control.

In a speech on 22 January 1958, Khrushchev officially proposed to dissolve the Machine and Tractor Stations (MTS), state organizations that owned and maintained the farm machinery used by kolkhozy. This reform had a particular significance in Soviet ideology. In Marxist-Leninist doctrine, cooperative ownership of property was considered a &quot;lower&quot; form of public ownership than state ownership. Khrushchev&#x27;s proposal to expand cooperative ownership ran contrary to the Marxist theory as interpreted by Stalin.

Suslov, who supported Stalin&#x27;s economic policy, regarded Khrushchev&#x27;s proposal as unacceptable on ideological grounds. In an election speech to the Supreme Soviet in March 1958, Suslov refused to recognise the ideological significance of Khrushchev&#x27;s reform, preferring instead to focus on the reform&#x27;s practical benefits in improving productivity. Unlike other Party leaders, Suslov avoided mentioning Khrushchev as the MTS reform&#x27;s initiator.

The 21st Party Congress convened in January 1959. Khrushchev wanted to consider the draft of a new Seven-Year plan. Suslov cautiously demonstrated against Khrushchev&#x27;s statement that the country had developed from the socialist state of development to the higher state of communist development. He saw Khrushchev&#x27;s view as flawed, and countered that his view had not been approved by the Party. To discredit Khrushchev&#x27;s assertion further, Suslov invoked Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin:

Suslov was becoming progressively more critical of Khrushchev&#x27;s policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate what was left of the Stalinist old guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations and was against Khrushchev&#x27;s attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.

Suslov visited the United Kingdom in 1959 as a parliamentarian for the Supreme Soviet. The visit was a success, and Hugh Gaitskell, the Leader of the Labour Party, travelled to the Soviet Union later that year as a guest.

Sino–Soviet relations had long been strained and, as Suslov told the Central Committee in one of his reports, &quot;The crux of the matter is that the Leadership of the CCP has recently developed tendencies to exaggerate the degree of maturity of socialist relations in China... There are elements of conceit and haughtiness. [These shortcomings] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the cult of personality of comrade Mao Zedong... who, by all accounts, himself has come to believe in his own infallibility.&quot; Suslov compared Mao&#x27;s growing personality cult with that seen under Joseph Stalin.

Suslov was highly critical of Maoist China, as he led the Sino-Soviet Dispute and criticized Maoism in various ways under the Khrushchev administration, particularly its split from the Soviet leadership in the Socialist Camp, the rejection of the theory of Peaceful Coexistence, and Mao&#x27;s support of anti-Soviet rival communist militant groups globally. In a report made on 14 February 1964 at a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, Suslov compared Mao&#x27;s China to Trotskyism, and denounced the Chinese leadership as petty-bourgeois nationalists and left-deviationists:

In the years following the failure of the Anti-Party Group, Suslov became the leader of the faction in the Central Committee opposed to Khrushchev&#x27;s leadership, known as the &quot;Moscow faction&quot;. Khrushchev was able to hold on to power by conceding to various opposition demands in times of crisis, such as during the 1960 U-2 incident and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the aftermath of the U-2 Crisis Suslov was able to remove, and replace, several of Khrushchev&#x27;s appointees in the Politburo with new anti-Khrushchev members. Khrushchev&#x27;s position was greatly weakened further after the failure of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Suslov&#x27;s power greatly increased.

A campaign to oust Khrushchev from office was initiated in 1964. Although leader of the opposition, Suslov had fallen seriously ill during his trip to the People&#x27;s Republic of China the previous year; instead, Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin led the opposition.

==Brezhnev era==

===Collective leadership===
In October 1964, Khrushchev was ousted. Suslov played a crucial role in the event.

Suslov was, alongside Premier Alexei Kosygin and First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, one of the most influential Soviet politicians of the 1960s following the ousting of Khrushchev. Having led the opposition against Khrushchev for years, Suslov had acquired and wielded great power within the Central Committee when Brezhnev rose to power. However, Suslov was never interested in becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, and was content to remain the man behind the scenes. During most of his term, Suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in the Secretariat and the Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Andrei Kirilenko and Fyodor Kulakov.
A collective leadership was founded immediately after the ousting of Khrushchev, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin as head of government, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state, who formed an unofficial Triumvirate (also known by its Russian name &quot;Troika&quot;). From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev.

While he condemned Stalin&#x27;s one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin&#x27;s post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership. Suslov was ranked fourth in the Politburo hierarchy behind Brezhnev, Podgorny and Kosygin, ahead of Kirilenko.

Throughout the Brezhnev era, Suslov became increasingly hardline. Suslov was opposed to any sort of anti-Soviet policies attempted by the Eastern Bloc leaders, but voted against Soviet military intervention in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in 1968 during the Prague Spring. Suslov was regarded, according to Christian Schmidt-Häuer, as the &quot;pope&quot; for &quot;Orthodox communists&quot; in the Eastern Bloc. Throughout his political career, Suslov became increasingly concerned that the Soviet Union&#x27;s leading role in the communist movement would be compromised. Häuer, in his book &quot;Gorbachev: The Path to Power&quot;, argues that Suslov &quot;was a Russian nationalist&quot; who believed &quot;Russia was the centre of the universe&quot;.

It was during the Brezhnev era that Suslov was given the unofficial title &quot;Chief Ideologue of the Communist Party&quot;. Suslov spent much time in memorializing the legacies of Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. However, Suslov followed the party line and supported the retreat from some of the beliefs of Marxism-Leninism. Examples of ideological retreat include the end of single, Party-approved natural science versions of biology, chemistry and physics.

There still existed, on the other hand, a tight ideological control over literature. This included not only literature critical of Soviet rule, but according to Robert Service, much of Lenin&#x27;s work: an unpublicised ban on the sale of Lenin&#x27;s Collected Works existed from the late 1970s onwards, although no such decree has been uncovered.

===Later life and death===
At the beginning of the 1980s, the political and economic turmoil in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic had seriously eroded the authority of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. Suslov&#x27;s position on this matter carried particular weight as he chaired a Politburo Commission, established on 25 August 1980, on how to deal with the Polish crisis. Members of the commission included such high-ranking Soviets as KGB Chairman Andropov, Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov, Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko, and Brezhnev&#x27;s long-time associate Konstantin Chernenko.

On 28 August, the Commission considered Soviet military intervention to stabilize the region. Wojciech Jaruzelski, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, was able to persuade the Commission that a Soviet military intervention would only aggravate the situation. Suslov agreed with Jaruzelski&#x27;s argument, stating that &quot;if troops are introduced, that will mean a catastrophe. I think that we all share the unanimous opinion here that there can be no discussion of any introduction of troops&quot;. Suslov was able to persuade Jaruzelski and the Polish leadership to establish martial law in Poland.

In January 1982, Yuri Andropov revealed to Suslov that Semyon Tsvigun, the First Deputy Chairman of the KGB, had shielded Galina and Yuri, Brezhnev&#x27;s children, from corruption investigations. When these facts were revealed to him, Suslov challenged Tsvigun to make a statement on the matter. Suslov even threatened Tsvigun with expulsion from the Communist Party, but Tsvigun died on 19 January 1982 before he could challenge Suslov&#x27;s statement.

Two days later, Suslov had a coronary thrombosis, and died on 25 January of arteriosclerosis and diabetes at 16:05. His death is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Brezhnev, in which Andropov, who assumed Suslov&#x27;s post as the Party&#x27;s Second Secretary, sidelined Kirilenko and Chernenko during the last days of Brezhnev&#x27;s rule.

Suslov was buried on 29 January at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall. Brezhnev expressed great sadness at Suslov&#x27;s passing.

==Recognition==
Suslov was awarded several decorations and medals during his life; among them were two Hero of Socialist Labour awards, five Orders of Lenin, one Order of the October Revolution, and one first degree Order of the Patriotic War. The USSR Academy of Sciences awarded Suslov the Gold Medal of Karl Marx. Suslov was awarded the highest state awards of the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.

==Personal life==
Suslov married Yelizaveta Alexandrovna (1903–1972), who worked as the Director of the Moscow Institute for Stomatology. In her life, she badly suffered from internal diseases, especially diabetes in a severe form, but ignored her physician&#x27;s recommendations.

Bernard Lown, a Lithuanian-born American M.D., was once requested to see her in the Kremlin Hospital; it was one of the few cases where a renowned foreign doctor was invited to visit the Kremlin Hospital. Suslov expressed his gratitude for Lown&#x27;s work, but avoided meeting Lown in person because he was a representative of an &quot;imperialistic&quot; country.

Yelizaveta and Suslov had two children, Revoly (born 1929), named after the Russian Revolution, and his second child, Maya (born 1939), named after May Day.

<text>Dmitriy Fyodorovich Ustinov (; 30 October 1908 – 20 December 1984) was a Soviet politician and a Marshal of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He served as a Central Committee secretary in charge of the Soviet military–industrial complex from 1965 to 1976 and as Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union from 1976 until his death in 1984. 

Ustinov was born in the city of Samara to a Russian working-class family in 1908. Upon reaching adulthood, he joined the Communist Party in 1927 before pursuing a career in engineering. After graduating from the Institute of Military Mechanical Engineering in 1934, he became a construction engineer at the Leningrad Artillery Marine Research Institute. By 1937, he transferred to the Bolshevik &quot;Arms&quot; Factory where he ultimately rose to become the director. While serving as People&#x27;s Commissar of Armaments during World War II, he achieved distinction within the party&#x27;s ranks by successfully overseeing the evacuation of Leningrad&#x27;s industries to the Ural Mountains, a feat for which he was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour. At the war&#x27;s end, he was entrusted with seizing raw materials, scientists and research left over from Germany&#x27;s missile programme. 

Under Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s leadership, Ustinov joined the Central Committee Secretariat and rose to become a candidate member of the Politburo by 1965. Following his rise to the central party apparatus, he was given the task of administering the Soviet Union&#x27;s defense industry and its armed forces. By 1976, he succeeded Andrei Grechko as Minister of Defense and received the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Thereafter, Ustinov&#x27;s hardline attitudes towards the West and unreserved backing for the Soviet arms buildup would dominate his country&#x27;s national security policy up until his death in 1984.

==Early life==
Dmitry Feodorovich Ustinov was born in a working-class family in Samara. During the Civil War, when hunger became intolerable, his sick father went to Samarkand, leaving Dmitry as head of the family. Shortly after that, in 1922, his father died. In 1923, he and his mother, Yevrosinya Martinovna, moved to the city of Makarev (near Ivanovo-Voznesensk) where he worked as a fitter in a paper mill. Shortly after that, in 1925, his mother died.

Ustinov joined the Communist Party in 1927. In 1929, he started training at the Faculty of Mechanics in the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Polytechnic Institute. Afterward, Ustinov was transferred to the Moscow Bauman Higher Technical School. Then, in March 1932, he entered the Institute of Military Mechanical Engineering in Leningrad from where he graduated in 1934. Afterward, he worked as a construction engineer at the Leningrad artillery Marine Research Institute. In 1937, he was transferred to the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Arms Factory as an engineer. He later became the director of the Factory.

==War service==

At the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941, Joseph Stalin appointed the 32-year-old Ustinov to the post of People&#x27;s Commissar of Armaments. From this position, he supervised the massive evacuation of the defence industry from the besieged city of Leningrad to east of the Ural Mountains. Over 80 military industries were evacuated that together employed over six hundred thousand workers, technicians, and engineers. Stalin later rewarded Ustinov, whom he called &quot;the Red-head&quot;, with the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest civilian honour, Hero of Socialist Labour. After the war was over, Ustinov played a crucial role in requisitioning the German missile programme, developed during World War II, as an impetus to the Soviet missile and space programmes.

==Post-war career==
In 1952, Ustinov became a member of the Central Committee. In March 1953, after Stalin died, the Ministry of Armaments was combined with the Ministry of Aviation Industry to become the Ministry of Defense Industry, with Ustinov assigned as head of this new ministry. In 1957, he was appointed as a Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union and became chairman of the Military-Industrial Commission.

===Rise to the Soviet leadership===

Leonid Brezhnev took power after the ousting of Khrushchev, and Ustinov returned to the defence industry. In 1965, Brezhnev made Ustinov a candidate member of the Politburo and secretary of the Central Committee with oversight of the military, the defense industry, and certain security organs. He was also placed in charge of developing the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategic bomber force and intercontinental ballistic missile system. Ustinov was known in the defense industry as Uncle Mitya. He was also missile engineer Vladimir Chelomey&#x27;s stolid personal adversary. He issued a , in February 1970, that ordered Chelomey&#x27;s OKB-52 design bureau to combine its Almaz space station with Sergei Korolyov&#x27;s OKB-1 design bureau, then headed by Vasili Mishin. This order was designed as an impetus towards the development of the Salyut space station.

Ustinov gained power in the bureaucracy as he rose in the defence industry.

===Minister of Defence===

In 1976, after Andrei Grechko died on 26 April, Ustinov became the Defence Minister and was promoted to General of the Army on 29 April. On 30 July, he was promoted to the highest military rank in the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union, although he had no prior military career. Together, with Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov and the Soviet General Staff, Ustinov embarked on a programme to enhance and modernise the Soviet Union&#x27;s development of military sciences. In 1979, he confidently asserted that &quot;The armed forces of the USSR are on a high level that ensures the accomplishment of any tasks set by the party and the people&quot;.

The growing influence of the Soviet military gave Ustinov the role of Kremlin kingmaker, for his support was decisive in allowing Yuri Andropov to succeed Brezhnev. Ustinov was also influential in the Chernenko regime, compensating for the latter&#x27;s serious health problems and inexperience in military affairs.
In 1979, Hafizullah Amin assassinated the leader of Afghanistan, Nur Muhammad Taraki. In October 1979, the sentiment for Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan grew stronger in the Soviet politburo where Ustinov and Andropov were the strongest proponents of military intervention. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko also lent his support for an invasion. The introduction of US forces into the Persian Gulf after the 1979 Iran hostage crisis particularly alarmed the Soviet General Staff. Ustinov began to wonder, &quot;If the Americans do all these preparations under our noses, then why should we hunker down, play cautious, and lose Afghanistan?&quot; In November, Ustinov and Andropov began to formulate plans for a Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan. On 12 December 1979, the Politburo approved the Ustinov-Andropov plan to invade Afghanistan. On 24 December 1979, Soviet troops entered Afghanistan.

In the early 1980s, the development of the Space Shuttle program in the United States caused considerable concern in the Soviet defense industry. While Defence Minister, Ustinov received a report from his analysts that the US Shuttle could be used to deploy space based nuclear missiles over Soviet territory. Russian space programme academic Boris Chertok recounts that Ustinov was so worried about the US Shuttle that he gave the development of the Soviet response program, the Buran Shuttle, top priority.

===Involvement in the KAL 007 Disaster===

In 1992, Russian president Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos dating from late 1983, memos that had been written within weeks of the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. These memos were published in Izvestia number 228 on 16 October 1992. According to these memos, the Soviet Union had been able to recover the &quot;Black Box&quot; from KAL 007 and decipher its tapes. Thereafter, Ustinov, along with Viktor Chebrikov, head of the KGB, recommended to General Secretary Yuri Andropov that their possession of the Black Box not be made public since its tapes could not support the Soviet contention that KAL 007 was on a U.S. espionage mission.
&quot;In connection with all mentioned above it seems highly preferable not to transfer the flight recorders to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or any third party willing to decipher their contents. The fact that the recorders are in possession of the USSR shall be kept secret. As far as we are aware neither the US nor Japan has any information on the flight recorders. We have made necessary efforts in order to prevent any disclosure of the information in future.&quot; (Memo 5.)

==Death and legacy==
On 7 November 1984, Ustinov did not preside over the annual Red Square Military Parade on the October Revolution Day. First Deputy Defense Minister Marshal Sergey Sokolov stood in for Ustinov to both inspect the troops and deliver the commemoration speech. Ustinov had contracted pneumonia in late October. Emergency surgery had to be performed to correct an aneurysm in his aortic valve. His liver and kidneys later deteriorated. Eventually, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died on 20 December 1984. He was honored with a state funeral, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on 24 December 1984.

The RFS &quot;Marshal Ustinov&quot; is a Russian warship named after him in his honor. The Baltic State Technical Military-Mechanical University in Saint Petersburg changed its name to the Ustinov Baltic State Technical Military-Mechanical University. The city of Izhevsk was also renamed after him from 1984 to 1987; however, under Mikhail Gorbachev, cities that had been renamed for recent Soviet leaders were reverted to their former names.

Ustinov placed great importance on the military for many decades. For example, he succeeded in always keeping the USSR&#x27;s intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, current. Ustinov also wrote several books throughout his life. These included &quot;Selected Speeches and Articles&quot; (1979), and &quot;To serve my country - the cause of Communism&quot; (1982).

==Personality and family==
In his memoirs Mikhail Gorbachev describes Ustinov as a man who normally had an energetic and bright personality. When Gorbachev was facing opposition in the Politburo shortly after Andropov&#x27;s death, Ustinov told Gorbachev to &quot;stand firm&quot; and to &quot;take heart&quot;.

Soviet Army Colonel General Igor Illarionov, an assistant of Ustinov for 30 years, described him as &quot;the most Stalinist of all the Commissars&quot;. Indeed, Ustinov had been groomed by Stalin to maintain the established system. Illarionov also said that Ustinov, like many of his contemporaries, was shaped by his experiences in the Great Patriotic War. Illarionov described Ustinov as a man who was very passionate about his work and had a habit of working late at night and sleeping for a couple of hours during the day.

The former Chief of the 4th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Health, Academician Yevgeniy Chazov wrote about Ustinov: &quot;I met him for the first time thanks to Andropov, who was his close friend. From the first moment I liked his will power, quick decision making, optimism, drive, expertise, combined with a certain simplicity and openness. In my mind, he represented the best representatives of the so-called command-and-control systems by which we defeated Germany during World War II. I think his only mistake, which he may not have realized, was the Afghan war. A bad politician and diplomat, he, as a representative of the old Stalinist &quot;guard&quot;, believed that all issues could be solved via a position of strength. On the other hand, I saw Andropov tossed and nervous because of the Afghan war. I believe that he ultimately understood their mistake. Ustinov, however, was always calm and apparently convinced that he was right.&quot;

However, Ustinov&#x27;s unwillingness to support any kind of reforms, even if popular within the Politburo itself, led to him frequently clashing with the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov. Ogarkov and many Officers of the General Staff resented Ustinov&#x27;s influence over Brezhnev, viewing him as a lobby for the interests of the Defense Industries against those of the Military. This became problematic for Ogarkov, since he favored reducing the massive Soviet military into a more compact strike force that utilized high-technology conventional arms and centered on Special Forces operations. Ustinov on the other hand (his lobbying for the defense industries notwithstanding), favored the usual emphasis on manpower and nuclear deterrence to maintain his &quot;high intensity non-nuclear conflict&quot; strategy, despite the lack of efficiency that became apparent in Afghanistan. In light of this, although Ustinov dramatically increased the technological capabilities of the Soviet Armed forces, most of the improvements were directed towards the operation of Strategic Nuclear Weapons, such as the Typhoon-class submarine, the Tu-160 bomber, and the SS-20 Saber.

Ustinov was married to Taisa Alekseevna Briekalova-Ustinova (1903–1975). They had a daughter, Vera Dmitriyevna Ustinova, and a son, Nikolai Dmitriyevich Ustinov (1931–1992). Ustinov also had a granddaughter, Nastya Nemtsova.

==In popular culture==
Ustinov appears briefly in Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; in his capacity as Defense Minister; his death is mentioned by the titular spy Colonel Filitov in &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;. He is given a more important role in the 2002 novel &quot;Red Rabbit&quot;, which takes place in between the events of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;Red October&quot;.

Ustinov is also a character of &quot;The Manhattan Projects&quot;, a comic book by Jonathan Hickman and Nick Pitarra. He is depicted as a disembodied brain mounted on a robot body.

<text>The [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] DSP-1 is a processor of early home theater surround sound equipment, produced in 1986. The DSP-1 (referred to by Yamaha as a Digital Soundfield Processor) allowed owners to synthesize up to 6-channels of surround sound from 2 channel stereo sound via a complex digital signal processor (DSP). Much like today&#x27;s home theater receivers the DSP-1 offered sixteen &quot;sound fields&quot; created through the DSP including a jazz club, a cathedral, a concert hall, and a stadium. However, unlike today&#x27;s integrated amps and receivers, these soundfield modes were highly editable, allowing the owner to customize the effect to his or her own personal taste. The DSP-1 also included an analog Dolby Surround decoder as well as other effects such as real-time echo and pitch change. 

Most of the DSP-1&#x27;s controls are on the unit&#x27;s remote control. The reason, as mentioned in the manual, being that it was felt that adjustments should be done at the listening position. This can make it difficult for collectors to find a complete functioning unit, although there is at least one provider of aftermarket remote controls with duplicate programming for the DSP-1 if needed. In Dolby Surround mode, only 4 channels are active, with just the front main channels and rear surround channels operating, the forward surround channels being muted. 

Yamaha has kept the DSP prefix for many of its home DSP and audio amp/receiver products.

<doc id="399591" wikidata="Q5175230" url="?curid=399591" title="Cosumnes River College">
<text>Cosumnes River College is a public community college in Sacramento, California. It opened in 1970, taking its name from the Cosumnes River which flows just a few miles to the south. As of Spring 2017, enrollment was at 13,091 students at its main and satellite campus in Elk Grove, California. Folsom Lake College, a former satellite campus, attained independence in 2004.

==History==
The concept for Cosumnes River College was included in a Master Facility Need Study that was approved by the Board of Trustees of the Los Rios Community College District in February 1967. A campus site of was obtained and construction proceeded on a library building, a science building, an automotive and technology complex, a women&#x27;s physical education building, and a swimming pool. In the fall of 1970 the college opened with an initial enrollment of about 2,100.

The architect who designed the original buildings of the college is Nacht &amp; Lewis Architects of Sacramento. They also designed the Learning Resource Center in 2005.

In September 1975, the Business/Social Science building was dedicated, which included computer laboratories. In the spring of 1989, the California state finals for the National Geography Bee were first held within the recital hall. They have been held there in April ever since. In fall of 1990, the cafeteria building was opened, with facilities for both staff and student dining, and also for the instructional food service program. The next phase of construction was in the summer of 1991, which added the College Center building with space for the Admissions/Records, Financial Aid, Business Services, Administration and the book store. In fall of 1995 a visual and performing arts complex was opened, completing the roster of facilities in the college&#x27;s original plan.

A permanent Child Development Center was completed in March 2002, and in December 2003 staff moved into a new Southeast Office Complex.

In 2004, the Folsom Lake Center was accredited and renamed as Folsom Lake College, becoming the fourth community college under Los Rios Community College District.

In 2004, construction on the Operations and Public Safety (OPS) building was completed. The building houses a variety of support services and departments. This includes a Health Services office staffed by college nurses, the Operations Department offices (housing the offices for Custodial/Maintenance Services and for Facility Use Processing), a Mail and Printing Center, and a substation of the Los Rios Community College Police Department.

The two-story Learning Resource Center was dedicated in 2005 with classroom space, and special computer labs for English as a Second Language, Digital Media, Journalism, and a Math Center. These buildings were funded in part from a voter-approved community college district bond, Measure A.

The college&#x27;s plans also include construction of an Elk Grove Center in the southern part of Elk Grove, California, United States. The center site was dedicated with a ground breaking in 2011. Construction also began in 2011 on the $18-million Winn Center for Construction and Architecture which will provide instructional space for Construction, Construction Management Technology, Pharmacy Technology, and Photography among other programs. The building was supported by a $1-million gift from Mike Winn and family.

In partnership with the Sacramento Regional Transit, (SACRT) construction the CRC/Regional Transit Parking Structure began in 2011. In 2015, the college received light rail service when the Blue Line was extended to terminate at a new station on Bruceville Road on the east side of the campus.

== Campus ==
The college occupies a campus of on the south side of Sacramento.

== Organization and administration ==
The college is part of the Los Rios Community College District.

== Student life ==
Cosumnes River College is home to The Connection, an award-winning biweekly newspaper. An opinion zine, The Voice, is also published on campus.

Cosumnes River College is also home to the environmental student organization &#x27;Students for a Sustainable Future Club&#x27; or SSF Club. Established in 2011, this group exists to promote sustainability and environmentalism through education, advocacy, and activism both on campus and in the community. This club is an official chapter of the California Student Sustainability Coalition as well as an affiliate of the Sierra Student Coalition.

== Athletics ==
The college was a factor in area college sports from the very beginning. It opened up the 1971 football season against reigning state champion College of the Redwoods and nearly pulled off an upset. That team was coached by Coit Conant. During the short period of time that the school fielded a football team, from 1971 to 1978, it was the predominant area power in that sport. The school has provided powerful teams in all other sports since the inception of the school winning several conference titles.

In 2006, the college became home to the now-defunct Sacramento Heatwave of the American Basketball Association (ABA). In 2012, The Cosumnes River Hawks Baseball team took home the school&#x27;s first ever state championship. In 2012 and 2013, the college&#x27;s Community Athletic Center hosted the California Community College Athletic Association state basketball Final Four and Championship tournament.

Major construction of new athletic fields on the north side of campus was completed in 2012–13, including two soccer fields, softball complex, baseball complex (renamed Conway Field), and complete remodeling of the shared-use football stadium with the addition of artificial turf.

== Notable alumni ==

* Mike Diva - VFX artist and director
* Jermaine Dye - Major League outfielder for the Chicago White Sox and 2005 World Series MVP

<text>John W. Holter (April 1, 1916 – December 22, 2003) was a toolmaker working for the Yale and Town Lock Company Stamford Connecticut. His son Casey Holter was born on November 7, 1955, with a severe form of spina bifida. Shortly after birth he contracted meningitis, which caused his head to expand rapidly. His parents were told that he had developed &quot;water on the brain&quot; or hydrocephalus.

As luck would have it Holter&#x27;s son was being looked after in Philadelphia, where the surgeons Nulsen and Spitz had already demonstrated that a ventricle-to-atrium diversion system could work. What they needed was an inexpensive and practical valve that could control the direction of the flow and maintain normal cranial pressure.

A chance discovery showed Holter, after a failed attempt in which a young boy died, that he could use a silicone one-way valve (pressure sealing). After a medically suitable grade of Silastic (silicone rubber) was found, the device was patented, and John Holter set up a company, Holter-Hausner International, to manufacture the cerebral shunts.

Although he was unable to save his son Casey, his design, the Spitz-Holter valve (also called the Spitz-Holter shunt) continues to help millions around the world since the late 1950s.

<text>Brain Salad Surgery is the fourth studio album by English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released on 7 December 1973 by their new record label, Manticore Records, and distributed by Atlantic Records.

Following the tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Trilogy&quot; (1972), the group acquired rehearsal facilities to work on new material, which would blend classical and rock themes. To control things, they launched their own record company, Manticore, in March 1973. The album was recorded from June to September at Olympic and Advision Studios and mixed in October 1973 at AIR Studios in London. As were all the group&#x27;s previous works, it was produced by Greg Lake. The album includes a cover designed by H. R. Giger.

Released to a mixed critical response, it has received more favourable reviews since its release. &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; continued the group&#x27;s commercial success, reaching number 2 in the United Kingdom and number 11 in the United States, and eventually gaining Gold certifications in both countries. In its support, the trio embarked on their largest world tour to date, including a headlining spot at the California Jam festival. The album has been remastered/remixed and reissued numerous times, including stereo and 5.1 surround sound remixes by Jakko Jakszyk.

==Background==
After the release of their third album, &quot;Trilogy&quot;, in June 1972, the group toured across Europe and the United States, playing in sold-out venues. By the beginning of 1973, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer had become commercially successful in both the UK and the US.

The group had become somewhat dissatisfied with their record label Atlantic Records for a lack of involvement. Around January 1973 Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, Carl Palmer, and their manager Stewart Young decided to form their own record company. Together, they bought an abandoned ABC cinema in Fulham, West London and converted it into a rehearsal room and company headquarters, which would later be named Manticore Records. Lake said: &quot;We set up Manticore to try and make the entire record process as good as it could be. We were also aware of a number of artists who we knew were having problems getting their music released and getting a record deal&quot;. Since the group knew that they would not have enough time to run their company, Atlantic promoter Mario Medious, who had worked with the group since their debut album, was brought in to serve as the president of Manticore in April 1973. Atlantic handled distribution duties.

==Production==
Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer began working on new material at the end of 1972. As Lake explained in an interview, the group&#x27;s previous record, &quot;Trilogy&quot;, was recorded with the use of 24-track machines and featured too many overdubs that made the music very difficult to recreate properly on stage. So the trio agreed to record an album that they could perform live. The rehearsal facilities equipped in the former cinema allowed the group to play live, then write, play live again, write again, etc., resulting in a feeling of addressing an audience, that would be alluded to in the well-known line &quot;Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends...&quot;.

===Writing===
During writing sessions around the end of 1972 and the beginning of 1973, the first two tracks began to take shape. One of them was the first movement of what would become the dominating composition of the forthcoming album, the epic &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;, and the other was an adaptation of the 4th Movement of Alberto Ginastera&#x27;s 1st Piano Concerto.

At nearly 30 minutes long, &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; would consist of three movements (called &quot;Impressions&quot;). Due to time limitations, the first movement initially had to be split into two parts between sides one and two of the vinyl record. Although the original Atlantic CD retained the division of the suite, subsequent editions have presented it in an uninterrupted version. All music of the epic was written by Emerson and can be described as a futuristic fusion of classical and rock themes. Structurally, the first and third movements are separated by an extended instrumental passage in spite of the whole composition having initially been conceived as an instrumental. All lyrics in the first movement are credited to Lake. To assist in creating lyrics for the third movement, he brought in lyricist Pete Sinfield, with whom Lake had worked at the time he was in King Crimson. Sinfield had been planning to make a solo album and had asked Lake for help to release it on Manticore. Lake had agreed that the record label would support Sinfield&#x27;s project and additionally suggested his contributing to lyrics for the group&#x27;s next album. Sinfield recalled: &quot;I was half way through making a solo album when Greg called me to say that Manticore wanted to release it. The catch was that he wanted me to collaborate on lyrics for a long piece that had begun to take shape&quot;. The main theme of the epic is the battle between artificial and natural intelligence, which would end with a man being taken over by the computer he had invented. It had initially been titled by Emerson as &quot;Ganton 9&quot; after a fictional planet to which all evil and decadence had been thrown out. However, Sinfield believed that the music Emerson had written sounded just like a carnival, and so he came up with the title &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;.

The most recognisable section of &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; is the second part of the first movement, containing the famous line &quot;Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends...&quot;, which was eventually taken as the title of the group&#x27;s second live album. It is often used as a song dedicated to the opening of sports seasons. It is also a common radio staple.

Emerson had contemplated recording an adaptation of the 4th Movement (&quot;Toccata concertata&quot;) of Ginastera&#x27;s 1st Piano Concerto as far back as the beginning of 1971. He had heard the toccata for the first time when he was a member of The Nice and had been &quot;struck with the music immediately&quot;. Emerson had not considered a possibility of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer playing the piece until Palmer proposed to incorporate a drum solo into the trio&#x27;s repertoire, which would be a core part of the composition. When Emerson played the toccata to Palmer, the latter approved it, and then, the piece was rehearsed by the entire group, although it was quite difficult, since Lake did not read music and Palmer was unable to apply a score written for piano to the drums.

Both &quot;Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression&quot; and &quot;Toccata&quot; were included in the setlist for a series of concerts across Europe beginning at the end of March 1973. Around that time, a new semi-acoustic number, &quot;Still...You Turn Me On&quot;, was introduced to the public. Written by Lake alone, the song has commonly been regarded as a necessary balance in the content, which is dominated by aggressive compositions. The next track intended for inclusion in the album was an adaptation of Hubert Parry&#x27;s hymn &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, with the lyrics from &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot;, a short poem from the preface to William Blake&#x27;s epic &quot;&quot;. Finally, the last piece, which would make the album, was the honky-tonk piano-based song &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot; composed by Emerson, with Lake and Sinfield writing the words.

After the album was almost completely recorded, three additional tracks, which would be put on the shelf for a while, were written: the instrumental &quot;When the Apple Blossoms Bloom in the Windmills of Your Mind I&#x27;ll Be Your Valentine&quot;, credited to the entire group, &quot;Tiger in a Spotlight&quot; and the title song, both composed by Emerson, with Lake and Sinfield providing lyrics. &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; was the first album to have no songwriting contributions from Palmer (aside from the drum solo in &quot;Toccata&quot;), who, nevertheless, has regarded it as his favourite by far.

===Recording===
The recording sessions began in June 1973 at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London, with Lake, as he had done on the group&#x27;s previous records, serving as the producer, and Chris Kimsey as the engineer. The only track committed to tape at Olympic was the first Impression of &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;. Following a period of further writing, the work on the upcoming album continued in August at Advision Studios in Fitzrovia, London, with engineer Geoff Young. The second and third Impressions of &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; were completed in the first half of that month, with the third Impression being the first track to be recorded at Advision. The muse&#x27;s sped-up and altered voice from the second Impression and the &#x27;computer&#x27; voice from the third Impression were contributed by Emerson, and his only vocal credit in the trio&#x27;s repertoire. In order to achieve the &quot;computer&quot; voice, he ran his voice through the Moog&#x27;s ring modulator.

Although an arrangement of Ginastera&#x27;s toccata had been performed by the group on their European tour from March to April 1973, the composition had received additional instrumentation before its final version was recorded. Palmer had written a percussion movement with the use of eight specially developed drum synthesizers. This movement with an &quot;atmospheric&quot; electronic sound was inserted in the middle section of &quot;Toccata&quot;. Soon after the adaptation was committed to tape in September, the group became aware that they did not have the rights to release this music. Emerson contacted Ginastera&#x27;s publishers who responded that the composer would not allow any adaptation of his works, but they advised him to talk to him personally. So Emerson flew to Geneva to discuss the issue with Ginastera himself. Once Ginastera heard the new arrangement, he gave the authorization to use his piece. To quote Emerson: &quot;He played our recording of &quot;Toccata&quot; on a tape recorder. After a few bars he stopped the tape ... and exclaimed &#x27;Diabolic!&#x27; I thought he said &#x27;diabolical&#x27; and expected him to show us the door. He had been listening to the tape in mono and our recording was in stereo. I jumped up and switched the machine to stereo hoping he would listen again. It transpired that he wasn&#x27;t concerned about that at all. He listened again and declared &#x27;Terrible!&#x27; which actually was a compliment. &#x27;You&#x27;ve captured the essence of my music like no one else has before&#x27;, the great maestro said.&quot;

The next songs recorded at Advision were &quot;Still...You Turn Me On&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. The adaptation of the hymn is notable for the debut of the first polyphonic synthesizer in history, the Moog Apollo, which was just a prototype of the Polymoog at that time. Together with the Lyra monophonic and the Taurus bass synthesizers, it formed the Moog Polyphonic Ensemble, also known as the Constellation. The Apollo synthesizer was also used by Emerson on &quot;Karn Evil 9: 3rd Impression&quot;.

In addition to its considerable evolution of synthesizer technology, &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; also contained a higher proportion of songs featuring acoustic and electric guitars than their earlier work. Whereas the first three studio albums contained only one or two tracks each with guitars, &quot;Toccata&quot;, &quot;Benny The Bouncer&quot; and both parts of &quot;Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression&quot; all feature electric guitar texturing, with two lengthy guitar solos highlighting Karn Evil 9. &quot;Still You Turn Me On&quot; additionally features multiple acoustic guitars and wah-wah guitar accents in addition to Emerson on harpsichord and accordion. From this point onward, the guitar would become a more common addition to ELP albums although it would remain subordinate to Emerson&#x27;s keyboard work.

===Mixing===
The results of the four-month recording sessions were mixed in the first week of October 1973 at AIR Studios in London. The original mix was turned down by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and as a result, most of the material was remixed once more to their satisfaction. The first mixes of several tracks have been released on some more recent reissues of the album.

==Artwork and packaging==
Since cover art for the impending album was required, Manticore manager Peter Zumsteg introduced Emerson to a popular artist, Hans Ruedi Giger, who was living in Zurich. In April 1973, as a part of their European tour, the group played a two-day concert there. After the concert, Emerson with Zumsteg visited the artist at his home. At that time, the working title for the album was Medious&#x27; expression &quot;Whip Some Skull on Ya&quot;, which is translated as fellatio. Coincidentally, under the impact of the music, including Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Giger had just created a human skull-based triptych entitled &quot;Work 216: Landscape XIX&quot;. When he revealed the triptych to his guests, Emerson immediately felt that it was completely appropriate for the album cover art.

Subsequently, the album title was changed to &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;, which has the same meaning as &quot;Whip Some Skull on Ya&quot;. The phrase was probably taken from the song &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot; by Dr. John, which had been a hit single in summer 1973 and contains the line &quot;I been running trying to get hung up in my mind, got to give myself a little talking to this time, just need a little brain salad surgery, got to cure this insecurity&quot;.

Giger painted two new pieces approximately the actual size of the vinyl record entitled &quot;Work 217: ELP I&quot; and &quot;Work 218: ELP II&quot;. The first painting was chosen by the group as the front cover. It contains the artist&#x27;s distinctive monochromatic biomechanical artwork, integrating an industrial mechanism with a human skull and the new &#x27;ELP&#x27; logotype, which was also designed by Giger and has been standard for Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer ever since. The lower part of the skull is covered by a circular screen, which displays the mouth and chin in its flesh-covered state, as well as what appears to be the top of a phallus below the chin, arising from the &#x27;ELP&#x27; tube. Art director Fabio Nicoli insisted on a non-standard construction of the vinyl sleeve rather than being a normal gatefold. The front cover of the novelty triptych sleeve was split in half down the centre, except for the circular screen, which was attached to the right flap, and was opened up like a gate. Opening the flaps revealed the second painting, featuring the full face of a human female (modelled after Giger&#x27;s partner Li Tobler) with ringlets of wire hair framing the closed eyes and multiple scars, including the infinity symbol and a scar from a frontal lobotomy. The illustration originally had the complete phallus, but when the artwork was presented to the record company, it was rejected and dismissed as pornographic. As Giger refused to take the penis off the painting, the group had another artist airbrush it into a shaft of glowing light. The back cover was entirely black with the large white lettering &#x27;Brain Salad Surgery&#x27;. &quot;Work 217: ELP I&quot; was also used as a custom label, with the spindle of the turntable penetrating through the lips. The vinyl packaging included a 12-panel fold-out poster with photographs of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, which were taken by Rosemary Adams.

When Manticore Records went defunct in 1977, Atlantic Records reissued the album with the initial design as well as with an ordinary vinyl packaging, which consisted of simple non fold-out outer and inner sleeves. The &#x27;face&#x27; painting was used as the back cover of the outer sleeve.

After the exhibition &quot;Giger in Prague&quot; was closed on 31 August 2005, the two original 34×34 cm acrylic-on-paper paintings &quot;Work 217: ELP I&quot; and &quot;Work 218: ELP II&quot; were lost or stolen and have not yet been found.

==Release==
Prior to the album becoming available, British newspaper &quot;New Musical Express&quot; released an issue with an attached free promotional flexi disc on 10 November 1973. Packaged in a miniature facsimile of the original album sleeve, the one-sided flexi disc, playing at 33 1⁄3 rpm, contained the song &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;, along with excerpts from all five tracks of the forthcoming album. Being a late-recorded track, the title song had not been intended for &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; and was not included in its track listing. However, it was later used as the B-side to the UK number two hit single &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; and ended up on the compilation of studio outtakes &quot;Works Volume 2&quot; (1977).

&quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 7 December 1973 by Manticore Records and was available on vinyl record, cassette, and 8-track cartridge through distribution by Atlantic Records. A reel-to-reel version of the album was also briefly available. The very first vinyl pressings were manufactured in the United States, along with the sleeves due to their non-standard construction. The album was a large seller, peaking at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and spending there 18 weeks. It was held from the top spot for two weeks in a row only by &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; from the arch-rival group Yes. On 1 March 1974, the album was certified Gold by British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. In Canada the album spent 3 weeks at number 10 and was in the Top 100 for 39 weeks.

In spite of the feeling that Lake&#x27;s acoustic song &quot;Still...You Turn Me On&quot; stood out as an evident single choice, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer did not select it for a release, both because Palmer did not play on the track and because it was least representative of the album or their general direction. Instead of that song, the group&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was chosen for the single, which would be backed with another studio out-take, &quot;When the Apple Blossoms Bloom in the Windmills of Your Mind I&#x27;ll Be Your Valentine&quot;. The single was released on 30 November 1973, but its success was inhibited by the BBC, which banned the song from airplay. As a result, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; failed to chart in the United Kingdom.

In the United States, &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; was released in December 1973 by Manticore on vinyl record, cassette, and 8-track cartridge, and distributed by Atlantic. Although no singles were issued, it climbed to number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed in the charts for 47 weeks, more than any other Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album. It has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling at least 500,000 copies in the United States.

===Reissues===
The album was released for the first time on CD, which was mastered by Barry Diament, in 1986. The earliest copies for the U.S. market were pressed in Japan. It was also released on CD in 1987 in West Germany under the Manticore label by RCA/Ariola and was the first to feature Karn Evil 9 playing in its entirety (While the tracks for Karn Evil 9 is split up, 1st Impression Part 1 &amp; Part 2 does not fade out and fade in). Since then &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; has been remastered/remixed, expanded, and reissued multiple times in different formats, with the studio outtakes &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; and &quot;When the Apple Blossoms Bloom in the Windmills of Your Mind I&#x27;ll Be Your Valentine&quot; having often been added as bonus tracks. In 1993, the album was remastered by Joseph M. Palmaccio. In 2000, Rhino Entertainment Company released a DVD-Audio containing a 5.1 surround sound mix, done by John Kellogg and Paul Klingberg.

Because of its length, &quot;Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression&quot; had originally been split into two parts for vinyl, with a fade-out at the end of side 1 and a fade-in at the beginning of side 2. Some early CD editions continued to split the track, but since then it has been presented as a single, uninterrupted piece.

In 2008, a remastered and expanded three-disc 35th-anniversary deluxe edition was released by Sanctuary Records, a subsidiary label of Universal Music Group at that time. Disc 1 (CD) contained the original album, remastered by Paschal Byrne. Disc 2 (CD) consisted of different recordings and mixes of tracks associated with &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;, as well as two bonus tracks: &quot;When the Apple Blossoms Bloom in the Windmills of Your Mind I&#x27;ll Be Your Valentine&quot; and &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;. Disc 3 was a hybrid SACD containing the original album in stereo and surround sound. For the 5.1 mix, the 2000 Rhino version was taken.

In 2014, a limited six-disc super deluxe box set edition was released by Legacy/Sony Music. Disc 1 (CD) contained the original album, remastered by Andy Pearce. Disc 2 (CD) was composed of bonus tracks associated with &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;. Disc 3 (CD) contained a new stereo version of the album. The original and new stereo versions in high resolution along with a brand new 5.1 surround sound mix by Jakko Jakszyk were featured on Disc 4 (DVD-Audio). &quot;The Manticore Special Documentary&quot; film, photo gallery, and Giger&#x27;s original artwork were included in Disc 5 (DVD-Video). Finally, Disc 6 was a 180gm vinyl record with the original album. A cut-down three-disc edition, which consisted of the Discs 1, 2, and 4 (but without the 5.1 mix), received international release around the same time. In Japan, the 40th anniversary 3 disc edition, on the Victor Entertainment label, contains the new stereo and 5.1 surround mixes as well as original stereo mixes on DVD-audio on the first disc, the original album remastered on the second disc, and on the third disc the Alternate Brain Salad Surgery with bonus tracks.

To mark the 50th anniversary a picture disc depicting the original Giger album artwork was released in the UK for Record Store Day on 22 April 2023.

==Critical reception==
Upon its initial release, the album was met with a remarkably polarized critical reception. Gordon Fletcher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered that although Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer managed to vanquish &quot;insufficient intensity and lack of worthy material&quot; of their previous records in live performances, these flaws overwhelmed all the group&#x27;s positives in the studio, resulting in things like &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;, which was deemed as a &quot;sadly uneven album from a group with technical gifts equal to that of any British trio&quot;. In particular, he counted the lyrics of &quot;Still...You Turn Me On&quot; to be somewhat overblown and dismissed &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot; as &quot;a needless nonsensical whimsey&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau, who had never been favourable towards Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, submitted a review, which consisted entirely of rhetorical questions, and assigned the album a very low &quot;C−&quot; rating. On the other side, Pete Erskine of &quot;Sounds&quot; was positive about the record, calling it the group&#x27;s &quot;most uncluttered and melodic album to date and certainly their rockiest&quot;. In The Pittsburgh Press, critic Pete Bishop praised &quot;the unmatched keyboard virtuosity of Keith Emerson,&quot; and called the album &quot;a feast of sounds and imagination.&quot; Before its release in the United States in December 1973, &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; was reviewed by &quot;Billboard&quot; and described as &quot;a complex, exciting sonic experience which touches on several bases—heavy rock, flowing jazz and some zesty pop material&quot;.

Retrospective response has been predominantly favourable. AllMusic contributor Bruce Eder cited the record as &quot;Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s most successful and well-realized album, and their most ambitious as a group, as well as their loudest&quot;. He summarized that it represents &quot;a high point that the trio would never again achieve, or even aspire to&quot;. Paul Stump, in his 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, characterized the album as frustratingly uneven, but highlighted the &quot;demonic&quot; version of &quot;Toccata&quot; and the group instrumental workout in the third part of &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; as among the band&#x27;s finest moments. While reviewing the box set &quot;A Time and a Place&quot; for the online &quot;All About Jazz&quot; magazine, John Kelman mentioned &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; as a &quot;crowning masterpiece&quot; and the group&#x27;s &quot;undeniable high water mark&quot;. The album was included in the musical reference book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;, where it was called &quot;the most fully realized—and still decidedly brazen—ELP statement&quot;.

In 2005, &quot;Q Classic&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; magazines placed &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; at number 5 on their &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;, which was published in the special edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;. In 2015, it was ranked the 12th greatest progressive rock album of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, whose reviewer Will Hermes characterised the record as &quot;prescient and pretty damn rocking&quot;.

==Tour==
Soon after the recording sessions ended and the tracks were mixed in October 1973, the group rehearsed for their upcoming world tour to promote the album. Spanning from 14 November 1973 to 21 August 1974, and including 100 live performances, it comprised four parts: Leg 1—North America (from 14 November 1973 to 18 December 1973, 28 shows), Leg 2—North America (from 24 January 1974 to 6 April 1974, 29 shows), Leg 3—Europe (from 18 April 1974 to 1 June 1974, 26 shows), and Leg 4—North America (from 26 July 1974 to 21 August 1974, 17 shows).

On stage, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer mixed the complex musicianship of their material with theatrics which attracted criticism. These included Emerson playing a grand piano while it revolved in mid-air, and abusing the Hammond organ by sticking knives in the manuals, throwing it around the stage and letting it feed back, while Palmer played on a revolving drum kit. The group carried almost 40 tons of equipment, which took five hours to unpack and set up, including a 30-channel board discrete quadraphonic public address sound system provided by International Entertainers Service, and a state-of-the-art lighting system, designed by Judy Rasmussen, which consisted of large ladders at each corner of the stage and two arches installed above the performance area.

Their 2 February 1974 concert, which was played in the main arena at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, was documented on the three-disc anthology &quot;Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;, released on 19 August 1974. Much of the performance was also used for broadcasting on the American rock music radio show &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;. The live album reached number 6 on the UK charts and number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which was the highest U.S. chart position the trio ever achieved.

Arguably the most high-profile performance was on 6 April 1974, when Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer co-headlined with Deep Purple at the California Jam festival, held at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California, with an attendance of 350,000 paying fans. Only 55 minutes of the group&#x27;s -hour festival-closing set was aired by ABC television network, which was a sponsor of the festival, on 7 May and 10 June 1974. The remaining footage of ELP&#x27;s entire performance has thus far not surfaced (unlike Deep Purple, whose entire 1-hour set has been issued in various audio and video releases). The extant ELP footage was eventually released on video in 2005 as a part of &quot;Beyond the Beginning&quot; DVD-Video. The audio recordings first appeared in 1998 on the album &quot;Then &amp; Now&quot;.

After the tour was completed in August 1974, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer took an extended hiatus from recording and performing. In 1976, the group reunited to work on their next album, &quot;Works Volume 1&quot; (1977).

<doc id="399605" wikidata="Q518711" url="?curid=399605" title="Landsmannschaft Schlesien">
<text>The Landsmannschaft Schlesien - Nieder- und Oberschlesien e.V. (&quot;Territorial Association of Silesia - Lower and Upper Silesia&quot;, &quot;Homeland Association of Silesia - Lower and Upper Silesia&quot;) is an organization of Germans born in the former Prussian provinces of Lower and Upper Silesia, and their descendants, who currently live in Germany. The Landsmannschaft Schlesien was established in March 1950 and is a member of the Federation of Expellees, and has its headquarters in Königswinter, North Rhine-Westphalia.

==About==

The association consists of people who were expelled or evacuated during World War II or after, and their descendants, as well as people who emigrated in more recent times, exercising their right to German citizenship, based on a 1913 German law. (See Aussiedler, the German Law of Return.) (The German nationality law was reformed in 1999 to, besides other matters, remove reference to ethnic German ancestry from the law.)

The current president is Stephan Rauhut who is a German Christian Democratic Union politician. He succeeded Rudi Pawelka on 9 November 2013, who had succeeded Herbert Hupka, the president from 1968 to 2000. All these presidents have been CDU members. According to the association, the Landsmannschaft currently has about 200,000 members nationwide. Until 1988, &quot;Der Schlesier&quot; (The Silesian) was the main organ of the Landsmannschaft.

In 1985, the Landsmannschaft planned to hold a congress in Stuttgart under the motto &quot;40 Jahre Vertreibung - Schlesien bleibt unser&quot; (&quot;40 years of expulsion - Silesia remains ours&quot;). Chancellor Helmut Kohl declined to attend unless the slogan was modified, which it was, to &quot;Silesia remains our future in a Europe of free nations&quot;. At the 2001 congress held in Nuremberg, Interior Minister Otto Schily was booed when he said that the expulsions were the consequence of German aggression.

There is also another Silesian Landsmannschaft, the Landsmannschaft der Oberschlesier e.V. (Bundesverband) representing Upper Silesians.

== Presidents of the Federation ==
The presidents of the Federation since its founding have been:
* 1950–1952: Walter Rinke
* 1952–1953: Karl Hausdorff
* 1953–1954: Walter Rinke
* 1954–1955: Julius Doms
* 1955–1968: Erich Schellhaus
* 1968–2000: Herbert Hupka
* 2000–2013: Rudi Pawelka
* 2013- : Stephan Rauhut

==Schlesische Jugend==
The youth organization of the Landsmannschaft, the Schlesische Jugend, was founded in 1948. Its aim is to preserve the heritage of Silesia with its culture and landscapes. The focus of the work of the Schlesische Jugend is cultural and political education. The Schlesische Jugend was accused of links with the right-wing Junge Landsmannschaft Ostdeutschland, and also to the extreme right-wing National Democratic Party of Germany which led in 2011 to its exclusion from the Landsmannschaft. A Divisional Court reversed the exclusion on 1 February 2012 as invalid, but the National Executive Board of the Landsmannschaft renewed the exclusion on 10 March 2012.

<text>Erika Steinbach (, born 25 July 1943) is a German right-wing politician. She previously served as a member of the Bundestag from 1990 until 2017.

She was a member of the Christian Democratic Union from 1974 to 2017, and served as a member of the CDU national board 2000–2010, as a member of the leadership of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group and as the CDU/CSU&#x27;s spokeswoman on human rights and humanitarian aid 2005–2017. Steinbach belonged to the socially conservative wing of the CDU and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. During the European migrant crisis, Steinbach was critical of Chancellor Merkel&#x27;s policies: in January 2017 she left the CDU over the migrant issue, from then on sitting as an independent member of the Bundestag. She did not stand in the September 2017 federal election, therefore leaving the Bundestag. Instead, Steinbach has publicly endorsed the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), though she did not become a member of the right-wing populist party. In 2018 Steinbach became President of the Desiderius-Erasmus-Stiftung, a political foundation affiliated with the AfD. A long-time member of the German-Israeli Association, Steinbach is also known for pro-Israeli views, and has often criticized the German Foreign Office for voting in favour of anti-Israeli resolutions at the UN.

In addition to her parliamentary activity, Steinbach was president of the Federation of Expellees from 1998 to 2014. Erika Steinbach studied music and was a member of concert orchestras before becoming a politician.

==Early life==
Steinbach&#x27;s father, Wilhelm Karl Hermann, was born in Hanau (Hesse, western-central Germany), but his family had their origins in Lower Silesia. In 1941 he was stationed in Rumia (), a village in the Second Polish Republic, which was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939 as part of the newly created province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. Wilhelm Karl Hermann served there as an airfield technician as a Luftwaffe Sergeant. Steinbach&#x27;s mother, Erika Hermann (née Grote), was ordered to work in the town after the annexation as a Luftwaffenhelfer. Steinbach was born there as Erika Hermann.

In January 1944, her father was deployed to the Eastern Front. In January 1945 during East Prussian Offensive of the Soviet Army, Steinbach&#x27;s mother together with her children, fled to Schleswig-Holstein in northwestern Germany. In 1948 the family moved to Berlin, where Steinbach&#x27;s grandfather had become mayor of one of the districts.

In 1949, Wilhelm Karl Hermann returned from Soviet captivity. In 1950, the family moved to Hanau, Hesse where Steinbach finished her education and started studying the violin. In 1967 she had to abandon her music career due to a damaged finger. In 1972, she married Helmut Steinbach, the conductor of a local youth symphonic orchestra. Steinbach graduated from a school of civil administration and moved to Frankfurt, where she started working for a Communal Evaluation Office.

==Political career==
===Career in the CDU, Member of Parliament===
In 1974 she joined the Frankfurt branch of the CDU. In 1977 she was elected a member of the Frankfurt City Council and held that post until 1990.

She was elected a member of the Bundestag in 1990, for the constituency of Frankfurt am Main III representing that until 1998. Since 2005, she has represented the constituency of Frankfurt am Main II. In 1990 she voted against the German–Polish Border Treaty (1990). In 1997 she criticized the approval of the Czech-German Declaration of Reconciliation.

Since 2005, she has been a member of the German parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid and spokesperson for human rights and humanitarian aid of the CDU/Christian Social Union fraction. She is also a deputy member of the parliamentary Committee for the Interior. Since 2000, she has been a member of the national board of the CDU (German, &quot;CDU-Bundesvorstand&quot;).

In 2009, she was offered the position of Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, but declined.

=== Federation of Expellees ===
Steinbach joined the German Federation of Expellees in 1994. In May 1998 she was elected President of the organization, and was re-elected in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The Federation of Expellees claims to have 1.3 million members. This figure was disputed in January 2010 by the German news service DDP, which reported an actual membership of 550,000.

The German Federal Expellee Law of 1953 defines as expellee all German nationals and ethnic Germans with a primary residence outside post-war Germany, who lost this residence in the course of the World War II-related flight and expulsions.

Steinbach has distanced herself from the Prussian Trust, that aggressively seeks restitution of German properties in Poland.

Steinbach represents the Federation of Expellees on the board of the national broadcasting company ZDF.

=== Centre Against Expulsions ===
Erika Steinbach is the founder, along with Peter Glotz, of the foundation Centre Against Expulsions (), which is working to establish a museum for the victims of &quot;Flight, displacements, forced resettlements and deportations all over the world in the past century&quot;, a project of the German federal government on initiative and with participation of the Federation of Expellees. The museum will contain a permanent exhibition to document expulsions including the expulsion of Germans after World War II.

The federal government established the federal foundation &quot;Flucht, Vertreibung, Versöhnung&quot; which is intended to be the basis of a future museum. The Federation of Expellees is entitled to appoint some of the board member, although they need to be confirmed by the cabinet.

On 4 March 2009 the Federation of Expellees decided not to nominate Steinbach to the council and instead left one seat unoccupied, after the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) threatened to veto Steinbach&#x27;s appointment to the board. On 19 October 2009, after the SPD was ousted from government and replaced by a liberal-conservative coalition dominated by Steinbach&#x27;s party, Steinbach announced her intention to take the seat at the board. However, objections against her were subsequently also raised by the new foreign minister Guido Westerwelle of the liberal Free Democratic Party. However, Steinbach is supported by her own party and the CSU, both of which have called upon Westerwelle to give up his resistance, and have cited earlier statements by Westerwelle where he had praised Steinbach a few years ago.

In 2006 she was involved in an exhibition on the expulsions in Europe in the 20th century. The exhibition deals with expulsions of German, Armenians, Poles, Turks, Greeks, Latvians, Karelians, Ukrainians, Italians and other peoples – topics many Europeans are unfamiliar with.

===International human rights activism===
As the CDU/CSU spokeswoman for human rights, Erika Steinbach is involved in a number of activities promoting human rights worldwide.

She was an expert speaker at the International Cuba Conference of the International Society for Human Rights in 2006.

===Franz Werfel Human Rights Award===
Together with Peter Glotz, she was the primary initiator of the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award, and serves as a jury member together with Otto von Habsburg, Klaus Hänsch and Otto Graf Lambsdorff among others. It has been awarded every second year since 2003 in the Frankfurt Paulskirche. The 2009 recipient was Herta Müller.

===Membership of the CDU national board===
Steinbach was a member of the CDU national board from 2000 to September 2010, when she chose to resign from the position following a controversy over comments about the German invasion of Poland. Steinbach, in support of other members of her expellee organization, said that the German attack on Poland was just a response to Poland&#x27;s mobilization, resulting in criticism of her. Steinbach&#x27;s resignation was met with mixed feelings within the CDU/CSU. Some members were worried that her departure could cause a split, and a formation of a new right wing party in Germany.

=== End of CDU membership ===
Steinbach left the CDU in January 2017, stating that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s decisions during the European migrant crisis, which she called a violation of the German law, prompted her decision. She did not run in the 2017 federal election.

=== Affiliation with the AfD===
After leaving the CDU, Steinbach became informally associated with the AfD. In 2018 Steinbach became President of the Desiderius-Erasmus-Stiftung, a political foundation affiliated with the AfD. As President of the foundation, Steinbach has also advocated pro-Israeli views.

===Interest in language===
Steinbach was member of the Goethe-Institut from 1994 to 2002. She is also member of the Verein Deutsche Sprache.

==Political positions==
Erika Steinbach was considered conservative within the CDU in most fields of policy, belonging to the initiators of the . Her work as a member of parliament focuses on human rights, and she is a strong critic of human rights violations in communist countries around the world. She is also a strong supporter of the process of European integration.

Steinbach endorses the &quot;Charter of the German expellees&quot; of August 1950.

===Social policy===
Erika Steinbach holds conservative views on social policy and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, which sometimes has caused controversy.

===Immigration===
Since the onset of the European migrant crisis, Steinbach has been one of the most vocal critics of Chancellor Merkel&#x27;s refugee policies. This resulted in her leaving the CDU in January 2017; she said that allowing so many people into Germany for months without identifying them properly went &quot;against our laws and against EU treaties&quot; and that she could no longer support the CDU.

==Perception==
Erika Steinbach is much more widely known in Poland and the Czech Republic than in Germany. According to Cordell and Wolff (2005), the political importance the Federation of Expellees has in German politics is overestimated in Poland and the Czech Republic because of its disproportional media presence in those countries and campaigns of &quot;aggressively nationalist politicians&quot;.

===Criticism===
Steinbach&#x27;s public pronouncements have been criticized by late President of Poland Lech Kaczyński for causing a deterioration in German-Polish relations. Steinbach has a negative reputation in Poland. One example of this was a 2003 cover montage of Polish news magazine &quot;Wprost&quot; that depicted her riding Chancellor Gerhard Schröder while wearing an SS uniform. In 2007 &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, a popular newspaper in Poland, reproduced a leaflet presenting Steinbach in the succession of the Teutonic Knights and the Nazis, and repeated claims of the full compensations never paid to Poland for losses caused by Nazi Germany.

Polish ambassador to Germany, Marek Prawda, Poland&#x27;s Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed unease with Steinbach&#x27;s appointment to the board of the Center against Expulsions in February 2009. Władysław Bartoszewski, an Auschwitz survivor who is Poland’s commissioner on relations with Germany, said that giving Mrs Steinbach a seat on the board would be akin to the Vatican appointing a Holocaust denier like Richard Williamson to manage relations with Israel. On 16 September 2010, Steinbach attested Bartoszewski &quot;a bad character&quot; on German TV. At the time the Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, privately warned Berlin that allowing Mrs Steinbach’s appointment would shake German-Polish relations “to their foundations”. &quot;Do people whose families lived there for generations want to be identified with a person like Mrs. Steinbach, who came to our country with Hitler and had to leave it with Hitler too?&quot; Sikorski said in Brussels on 23 February 2009, referring to Steinbach’s father having moved to German-occupied Poland during the war and asked her to follow the example of President Horst Köhler, who was born within a family of wartime German settlers in Poland and never considered himself an expellee. The fact that Steinbach represents a person born to a German officer stationed in occupied Poland has been described as one of the essential issues for Poles.

Václav Havel, the former president of the Czech Republic and anti-communist dissident, was said to refuse to speak to Steinbach due to the positions taken by the Federation of Expellees under her leadership.

According to an editorial in the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, the Polish criticism may be part of an &quot;anti-German campaign&quot; in which Steinbach has become the &quot;enemy stereotype&quot; and &quot;demonization of Steinbach is a kind of reason of state&quot;. The way she is portrayed to the Polish public has been described by some German editorial writers as having &quot;hysteric features&quot; or a &quot;psychosis&quot;. Some German media blame members of Law and Justice for having used her as a &quot;hate figure&quot; in internal politics to counter Donald Tusk ignoring Steinbach&#x27;s &quot;real views&quot;.

===Lecture controversy===
In May 2008 Steinbach started a series of lectures about the &quot;German settlement in Eastern Central Europe&quot; at the University of Potsdam. However demonstrations by left-wing students who protested against Steinbach&#x27;s allegedly revisionist views on German history by throwing water filled balloons and blocking the entrances compelled her to cancel the further lectures. On 11 June 2008, a full meeting of the students council decided (with 146 against 7 votes) to protect the right of freedom of opinion and speech and invited Steinbach again, if necessary under police protection. The local Mayor, supported by several political parties, expressed his displeasure about the incident and requested that the university council invite Steinbach again.

==Honours==
On 9 July 2009, she was awarded the Bavarian Order of Merit by Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer for her work for the rights of the victims of the Expulsion.

<doc id="399617" wikidata="Q376791" url="?curid=399617" title="Production–possibility frontier">
<text>In microeconomics, a production–possibility frontier (PPF), production possibility curve (PPC), or production possibility boundary (PPB) is a graphical representation showing all the possible options of output for two that can be produced using all factors of production, where the given resources are fully and efficiently utilized per unit time. A PPF illustrates several economic concepts, such as allocative efficiency, economies of scale, opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency, and scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face). 

This tradeoff is usually considered for an economy, but also applies to each individual, household, and economic organization. One good can only be produced by diverting resources from other goods, and so by producing less of them.

==The PPF curve==
Graphically bounding the production set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the maximum possible production level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency in the context of that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility.

PPFs are normally drawn as bulging upwards or outwards from the origin (&quot;concave&quot; when viewed from the origin), but they can be represented as bulging downward (inwards) or linear (straight), depending on a number of assumptions. 

An outward shift of the PPC results from growth of the availability of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of &quot;both&quot; outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labour force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.

However, most economic contractions reflect not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier, as typically, both labour and physical capital are underemployed, remaining therefore idle.

In microeconomics, the PPF shows the options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world. By definition, each point on the curve is productively efficient, but, given the nature of market demand, some points will be more profitable than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable.

From a macroeconomic perspective, the PPF illustrates the production possibilities available to a nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the &quot;y&quot;-axis versus investment on the &quot;x&quot;-axis. However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient. Market failure (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) may lead to the wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.

== Position ==

The two main determinants of the position of the PPF at any given time are the state of technology and management expertise (which are reflected in the available production functions) and the available quantities of factors of production (materials, direct labor, and factory overhead).

Only points on or within a PPF are actually possible to achieve in the short run. In the long run, if technology improves or if the supply of factors of production increases, the economy&#x27;s capacity to produce both goods increases; if this potential is realized, economic growth occurs. That increase is shown by a shift of the production-possibility frontier to the right. Conversely, a natural, military or ecological disaster might move the PPF to the left in response to a reduction in an economy&#x27;s productive capability. Thus all points on or within the curve are part of the production set: combinations of goods that the economy could potentially produce.

If the two production goods depicted are capital investment (to increase future production possibilities) and current consumption goods, the higher the investment this year, the more the PPF would shift out in following years. Shifts of the curve can represent how technological progress that favors production possibilities of one good, say guns, more than the other shifts the PPF outwards more along the favored good&#x27;s axis, &quot;biasing&quot; production possibilities in that direction. Similarly, if one good makes more use of say capital and if capital grows faster than other factors, growth possibilities might be biased in favor of the capital-intensive good. Also a shift in the PPF could depict that there&#x27;s an improvement in technology or good use of capital goods.

=== Efficiency ===

Production-Possibility Frontier delineates the maximum amount/quantities of outputs (goods/services) an economy can achieve, given fixed resources (factors of production) and fixed technological progress.

*Points that lie either on or below the production possibilities frontier/curve are possible/attainable: the quantities can be produced with currently available resources and technology.
*Points that lie above the production possibilities frontier/curve are not possible/unattainable because the quantities cannot be produced using currently available resources and technology.
*Points that lie strictly below the frontier/curve are inefficient, because the economy can produce more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good, with existing resources and technology.
*Points that lie on the frontier/curve are efficient.
Points that are unattainable can be achieved through external trade and economic growth. Examples include importations of resources and technology, and the increase in the production of goods and services.

Specifically, at all points on the frontier, the economy achieves productive efficiency: no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good.

Some productive efficient points are Pareto efficient: impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off. Pareto efficiency is achieved when the marginal rate of transformation (slope of the frontier/opportunity cost of goods) is equal to all consumers&#x27; marginal rate of substitution.

Similarly, not all Pareto efficient points on the frontier are Allocative efficient. Allocative efficient is only achieved when the economy produces at quantities that match societal preference.

A PPF typically takes the form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that it would be impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.

For example, if one assumes that the economy&#x27;s available quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns would need to be sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: &quot;B&quot; if guns are of interest, &quot;C&quot; if more butter is needed, &quot;D&quot; if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.

In the PPF, all points &quot;on&quot; the curve are points of maximum productive efficiency (no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good); all points inside the frontier (such as &quot;A&quot;) can be produced but are productively &quot;inefficient&quot;; all points outside the curve (such as &quot;X&quot;) cannot be produced with the given, existing resources. Not all points on the curve are Pareto efficient, however; only in the case where the marginal rate of transformation is equal to all consumers&#x27; marginal rate of substitution and hence equal to the ratio of prices will it be impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off.

Any point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie to the right of the production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.
For an extensive discussion of various types of efficiency measures (Farrell, Hyperbolic, Directional, Cost, Revenue, Profit, Additive, etc.) and their relationships, see Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, Chapter 3).

=== Marginal rate of transformation ===

The slope of the production–possibility frontier (PPF) at any given point is called the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). The slope defines the rate at which production of one good can be redirected (by reallocation of productive resources) into production of the other. It is also called the (marginal) &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of a commodity, that is, it is the opportunity cost of &quot;X&quot; in terms of &quot;Y&quot; at the margin. It measures how much of good Y is given up for one more unit of good &quot;X&quot; or vice versa. The shape of a PPF is commonly drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good. Thus, MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF.

The marginal rate of transformation can be expressed in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point &quot;BB&quot; in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at &quot;AA&quot;, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.

== Shape ==
The production-possibility frontier can be constructed from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) is the most common form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point &quot;B&quot; to point &quot;D&quot;), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.

If opportunity costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects a situation where resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant opportunity costs. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.

With economies of scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. Specialization in producing successive units of a good determines its opportunity cost (say from mass production methods or specialization of labor).

== Opportunity cost ==
From a starting point on the frontier, if there is no increase in productive resources, increasing the production of a first good entails decreasing the production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.

In the context of a PPF, opportunity cost is directly related to the shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as the production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In Figure 7, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;). At point &quot;C&quot;, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the &quot;marginal rate of transformation.&#x27;

<text>Damavand () is a city in the Central District of Damavand County, Tehran province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 36,433 in 10,279 households. The following census in 2011 counted 37,315 people in 11,455 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 48,380 people in 15,267 households.

==Overview==
Damavand is an ancient and historic city. The name Damavand appears in Sassanid texts (as &quot;Dunbawand&quot;), and Parthian remains have been found there. The city fell to Arab Muslim invaders in 651 CE during the Muslim conquest of Iran. It is close to Iran&#x27;s tallest peak Mount Damavand, which Ferdowsi mentions abundantly in the Shahnameh.
The city has relatively cool weather year-round.

==Climate==
Damavand has a humid continental climate with hot summers, very cold snowy winters and cool rainy springs and autumns (Köppen: &quot;Dsa&quot;). The average annual temperature is 9.6°C in Damavand.

==Economy==
Damavand is an agricultural city and due to its streams, rivers, springs and temperate climate, it has numerous gardens and fields. An important part of the city&#x27;s economy is provided by the export of tree products. Apples, pears, cherries, apricots, walnuts, apricots, tomatoes, wheat, potatoes, beans and cucumbers are some of the products of this city, some of which, like apples and pears, are famous and distinguished in terms of type. In recent years, beekeeping has become one of the sources of income for the people of this city and Damavand honey competes with the best honey in Iran in terms of quality and constitutes a significant part of the city&#x27;s exports. New style livestock has been developed in Damavand for several years and the obtained products are exported to Tehran in addition to meeting the needs of the region.

==Transportation==
Damavand can be reached by road from Firuzkuh via Gilavand and from Haraz road, via Mosha.

==Historical attractions==
Damavand contains 37 historical tombs (Imamzadeh), 27 castle ruins, 23 traditional houses of architectural significance, 18 traditional bath houses, 6 caves, 5 historical bridges, 3 historical mosques, and 3 caravanserais.

The main landmarks are the Friday Mosque (15th century) and the Sheikh Shebli Mausoleum and Tower, dating to the Seljuq era.

<text>When a message is replied to in e-mail, Internet forums, or Usenet, the original can often be included, or &quot;quoted&quot;, in a variety of different posting styles.

The main options are interleaved posting (also called inline replying, in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post), bottom-posting (in which the reply follows the quote) or top-posting (in which the reply precedes the quoted original message). For each of those options, there is also the issue of whether trimming of the original text is allowed, required, or preferred.

For a long time the traditional style was to post the answer below as much of the quoted original as was necessary to understand the reply (bottom or inline). Many years later, when email became widespread in business communication, it became a widespread practice to reply above the entire original and leave it (supposedly untouched) below the reply.

While each online community differs on which styles are appropriate or acceptable, within some communities the use of the &quot;wrong&quot; method risks being seen as a breach of netiquette, and can provoke vehement response from community regulars.

==Quoting previous messages==
In an e-mail reply, it is sometimes appropriate to include a full or partial copy of the original message that is being replied to; due to the asynchronous nature of Internet communication, people often engage in many conversations at the same time, and email responses may be received long after the original message was sent. For these reasons, the original poster may not be aware of what message a post is intended to be a response to, and providing context is helpful. Many email reading programs (mail user agents) encourage this behaviour by automatically including a copy of the original message in the reply editing window.

Quoted text from previous messages is usually distinguished in some way from the new (reply) text. Often, the two parts are given different indentation. In the example below, the first paragraph is the original message, the second is the reply:

 I can&#x27;t believe you would say something like this.
 All these words are terrible.
 They&#x27;re hurtful and they make no sense.
 -- DocEvil
 &lt;br&gt;
 Much like your posting.
 -- Jim

Alternatively, special delimiter lines may be used:

 Hey Joe, Paris is in France, not England. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 --- original message ---
 You just had a call from England, from Paris I think. --Joe
 --- end of original message ---

For extra clarity, blank lines may also be inserted between the two parts. When using an email medium that supports text markup (such as HTML or RTF), the previous text may be indicated by a distinctive font and/or color:

 The meeting has been postponed to next Friday. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 Has the deadline for the report been moved too? --Joe

===Quoted line prefix===
A common convention in plain-text email is to prefix each line of the quoted text with a distinctive character or string. As of 2020 (and for many years previously), the greater-than sign (&quot;codice_1&quot;, the prefix) is almost universally used; but other characters such as the ASCII vertical bar character (&quot;codice_2&quot;) have been used as well, sometimes with one or more spaces inserted before or after the quoted text marker.

There is no standard declaring one quote-prefix to be &quot;right&quot; and others to be &quot;wrong&quot;, but some standards depend on conventional quoting. The &quot;never issued&quot; and obsolete &quot;son-of-1036&quot; draft RFC 1849 recommends &quot;codice_1&quot; as the quote-prefix; RFC 3676 depends on it and considers &quot;codice_4&quot; and &quot;codice_5&quot; to be semantically different. That is, &quot;codice_4&quot; has a quote-depth of two, while &quot;codice_5&quot; has a quote-depth of one, quoting a line starting with &quot;&gt;&quot;. Most e-mail clients treat the two sequences as equivalent, however.

The convention of quoting was common in Usenet newsgroups by 1990, and is supported by many popular email interfaces, either by default or as a user-settable option. In Microsoft Outlook, for instance, this behavior is controlled by an option labeled &quot;Prefix each line of the original&quot;. Besides inserting markers automatically in quoted lines, some interfaces assume that a line starting with a &quot;codice_1&quot; character or similar is quoted text, and will automatically display it in a distinctive font or color:

 &gt; How is the report coming? --Mary
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Sometimes the insertion of a quoted line marker will cause one original line to be folded as two lines in the reply, and the continuation line may not have the proper marker. To avoid ambiguity in such cases, one may consider inserting blank lines after each block of quoted text:

 &gt;The board is asking again for the sales data. We really must provide
 &gt; them with some figures. How is the report coming? --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe

Quoted line markers are most commonly used in plain-text messages. In HTML messages, other devices may be used to indicate quoted text, such as HTML indentation elements like codice_9 or codice_10.

===Reply level indication===
A message often includes text from two or more messages exchanged in previous rounds of a long discussion. If an additional quotation marker is inserted at every round, without removing any existing markers, the number of markers at the beginning of each line will show the &quot;level&quot; of the reply, that is, how many rounds have occurred since that line was written. These accumulated markers are usually sufficient to distinguish the parts that came from each message. Some email interfaces recognize this convention and automatically render each level in a different color. For example:

 »&gt; How is the report coming? --Mary
 » It will be on your desk by noon. --Joe
 &gt; Sorry Joe, I need it by 11:00 at the latest. --Mary
 &lt;br&gt;
 OK, but it will be missing this month&#x27;s figures. --Joe

If the discussion is between two parties only, then an even number of markers (including zero) identifies text written by the sender, while an odd number of markers identifies text by the recipient. (In the above example even numbers are Joe&#x27;s text and odd numbers are Mary&#x27;s.)

 No problem. 6pm it is then. --Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:
 &gt; Whoa! I need to email a report at 5:30.
 &gt; Could you push it back an hour? --Danny
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:
 » I&#x27;m going to suspend the mail service for approx. thirty
 » minutes tonight, starting at 5pm. --Jim

In HTML messages, codice_9 or codice_10 elements may be nested to achieve the same effect.

===Attribution lines===
Quoted material is often preceded by an &quot;attribution line&quot; that identifies its author. These lines are particularly helpful in discussions between multiple parties. For example:

 Nancy wrote:
 &gt; Peter wrote:
 » When will we have the performance figures?
 &gt; The tests will be completed next week. 
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 &gt; Mary wrote:
 » We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.
 &gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter. We need the sales data and also Nancy&#x27;s
 performance figures. Let&#x27;s meet next Friday after lunch.

This reply quotes two messages, one by Nancy (itself a reply to Peter) and one by Peter (itself a reply to Mary).

Many mail agents will add these attribution lines automatically to the top of the quoted material. Note that a newly added attribution line should not get the quotation marker, since it is not part of the quoted text; so that the level indicator of the attribution line is always one less than the corresponding text. Doing otherwise may confuse the reader and also e-mail interfaces that choose the text color according to the number of leading markers.

Instead of an attribution line, one may indicate the author by a comment in brackets, at the beginning of the quotation:

 » [Peter:] When will we have the performance figures?
 &gt; [Nancy:] The tests will be completed next week. 
 » [Mary:] We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.
 &gt; [Peter:] Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter. We need the sales data and Nancy&#x27;s
 performance figures. Let&#x27;s meet next Friday after lunch.

Another alternative, used in Fidonet and some mail user agents, is to place the initials of the author before the quoting marker. This may be used with or without attribution lines:

 Nancy wrote:
 N&gt; Peter wrote:
 P» When will we have the performance figures?
 N&gt; The tests will be completed next week. 
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter wrote:
 P&gt; Mary wrote:
 M» We should meet today to discuss the marketing strategy.
 P&gt; Better wait, we do not have the West Coast sales data yet.
 &lt;br&gt;
 I agree with Peter. We need the sales data and also Nancy&#x27;s
 performance figures. Let&#x27;s meet next Friday after lunch.

==Trimming and reformatting==
When replying to long discussions, particularly in newsgroup discussions, quoted text from the original message is often trimmed so as to leave only the parts that are relevant to the reply—or only a reminder thereof. This practice is sometimes called &quot;trim-posting&quot; or &quot;edited posting&quot;, and is recommended by some manuals of posting etiquette.

Sometimes an indicator of deleted text is given, usually in the form of a square bracketed tag as: &quot;[snipped]&quot;, &quot;[trimmed]&quot;, or simply &quot;[...]&quot;. The text that is retained may be edited to some extent, e.g. by re-folding the lines. For example, if the original message was

 This is a reminder that the project meeting which was canceled
 last week will be held today in the 3rd floor conference room at
 14:30 sharp. Everybody must attend. --Mary

the reply may be

 &gt; the project meeting [...] will be held today in the 3rd floor
 &gt; conference room
 Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

or even just

 &gt; 3rd floor conference room
 Mary, be sure to check the mics in that room. --Joe

Deleted text may also be replaced by a summary in brackets:

 On Thursday, Jim wrote:
 &gt; The movie clearly adds a sense of menace to the story
 &gt; which is not present in the original book.
 &gt; [...claim that the darker tone weakens the movie...]
 I disagree. The darker tone works well, once one understands
 the two are aimed at different audiences.

Automatically included text (such as signature blocks, free e-mail service ads, and corporate disclaimers) are more likely to be deleted, usually without ellipses, than manually written text. Some posters may delete any parts of the original message that they are not replying to. Some posters delete only parts dealing with issues that they see as &quot;closed&quot;, and leave any parts that, in their opinion, deserve further discussion or will be replied to in a later message.

===How much to trim===
Some style guides recommend that, as a general rule, quoted material in replies should be trimmed or summarized as much as possible, keeping only the parts that are necessary to make the readers understand the replies. That of course depends on how much the readers can be assumed to know about the discussion. For personal e-mail, in particular, the subject line is often sufficient, and no quoting is necessary; unless one is replying to only some points of a long message.

In particular, when replying to a message that already included quoted text, one should consider whether that quoted material is still relevant. For example:

 » [Mary:] Shall we meet this afternoon to discuss the
 » marketing strategy?
 &gt; [Peter:] Perhaps, if we can get all the information we need.
 &gt; Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?
 &lt;br&gt;
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

The quote from Mary&#x27;s message is relevant to Peter&#x27;s reply, but not to Joe&#x27;s reply. The latter could have been trimmed to

 &gt; [Peter:] Do we have the West Coast sales data yet?
 The LA office just sent them in.
 Joe

On the other hand, in some situations, any trimming or editing of the original message may be inappropriate. For example, if the reply is being copied to a third person who did not see the original message, it may be advisable to quote it in full; otherwise the trimmed message may be misinterpreted by the new recipient, for lack of context.

Also, when replying to a customer or supplier, it may be advisable to quote the original message in its entirety, in case the other party somehow failed to keep a copy of it.

==Placement of replies==

=== Interleaved style ===
In the interleaved reply style (also called &quot;inline reply&quot;, &quot;interlined reply&quot;, &quot;point-by-point rebuttal&quot;, or, sometimes, &quot;bottom posting&quot;), the original message is broken into two or more sections, each followed by a specific reply or comment. A reply in inline style may also include some top-posted or bottom-posted comments that apply to the whole reply message, rather than to a specific point. For example:

 I have been following the discussion about the new product line. Here are my thoughts.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Joe wrote:
 &gt; Will our prices be competitive?
 &lt;br&gt;
 That may not be a problem for now, we still have a quality edge.
 &gt; We do not have enough trained people on the West Coast. We have many
 &gt; new employees but they do not know our products yet.
 &lt;br&gt;
 We can bring them here for a crash training course.
 &lt;br&gt;
 Mary wrote:
 &gt; We still do not have a clear marketing plan. 
 &lt;br&gt;
 Peter, would you take charge of that? Let me know if you need help.
 &lt;br&gt;
 On the whole, I am quite optimistic. It looks like we will be shipping
 the basic system before the end of this quarter.
 Nancy

The interleaved reply style can also be combined with top-posting: selected points are quoted and replied to, as above, and then a full copy of the original message is appended.

 &gt; Can you present your report an hour later?
 &lt;br&gt;
 Yes I can. The summary will be sent no later than 5pm.
 Jim
 &lt;br&gt;
 At 10.01am Wednesday, Danny wrote:
 » 2.00pm: Present report
 &gt; Jim, I have a meeting at that time. Can you present your report an hour later?
 » 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback
 &gt; Also if you do the above, this may need to happen later too.
 &gt; Danny
 &gt; At 9.40am Wednesday, Jim wrote:
 » My schedule for today will be:
 » 10.00am: Gather data for report
 » 2.00pm: Present report to team
 » 4.30pm: Send out summary of feedback

Interleaving was the predominant reply style in the Usenet discussion lists, years before the existence of the WWW and the spread of e-mail and the Internet outside the academic community.

Interleaving was also common originally in e-mail, because many internet users had been exposed to Usenet newsgroups and other Internet forums, where it is still used. The style became less common for email after the opening of the internet to commercial and non-academic personal use. One possible reason is the large number of casual e-mail users that entered the scene at that time. Another possible reason is the inadequate support provided by the reply function of some webmail readers, which either do not automatically insert a copy of the original message into the reply, or do so without any quoting prefix level indicators. Finally, most forums, wiki discussion pages, and blogs (such as Slashdot) essentially impose the bottom-post format, by displaying all recent messages in chronological order.. Interleaving continues to be used on technical mailing lists where clarity within complex threads is important..

===Top-posting===

In &quot;top-posting&quot; style, the original message is included verbatim, with the reply above it. It is sometimes referred to by the acronym &quot;TOFU&quot; (&quot;text over, fullquote under&quot;). It has also been colloquially referred to as &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; reply style: as in the game show&#x27;s signature clue/response format, the answers precede the question.

Example:
 No problem. 6pm it is then.

Top-posting preserves an apparently unmodified transcript of a branch in the conversation. Often all replies line up in a single branch of a conversation. The top of the text shows the latest replies. This appears to be advantageous for business correspondence, where an e-mail thread can dupe others into believing it is an &quot;official&quot; record.

By contrast, excessive indentation of interleaved and bottom posting may turn difficult to interpret. If the participants have different stature such as manager vs. employee or consultant vs. client, one person&#x27;s cutting apart another person&#x27;s words without the full context may look impolite or cause misunderstanding.

In the earlier days of Usenet informal discussions where everyone was an equal encouraged bottom-posting. Until the mid-1990s, posts in a net.newcomers newsgroup insisted on interleaving replies. Usenet &quot;comp.lang&quot; hierarchy, especially comp.lang.c and comp.lang.c++ insisted on the same as of the 2010s. The &quot;alt&quot; hierarchy tolerated top-posting. Newer online participants, especially those with limited experience of Usenet, tend to be less sensitive to arguments about posting style.

Top-posting can be problematic on mailing lists with ongoing discussions which eventually require someone to act on the top-posted material. For example, top-posting &quot;Those changes look ok to me, go ahead and make them&quot; can be very inconvenient, as readers may need to read through a long email trail to know which changes the top-poster is referring to. Inter-leaving the text directly below the text describing the changes is much more convenient in these cases.

Users of mobile devices, like smartphones, are encouraged to use top-posting because the devices may only download the beginning of a message for viewing. The rest of the message is only retrieved when needed, which takes additional download time. Putting the relevant content at the beginning of the message requires less bandwidth, less time, and less scrolling for the user.

Top-posting is a natural consequence of the behavior of the &quot;reply&quot; function in many current e-mail readers, such as Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, and others. By default, these programs insert into the reply message a copy of the original message (without headers and often without any extra indentation or quotation markers), and position the editing cursor above it. Moreover, a bug present on most flavours of Microsoft Outlook caused the quotation markers to be lost when replying in plain text to a message that was originally sent in HTML/RTF. 
For these and possibly other reasons, many users seem to accept top-posting as the &quot;standard&quot; reply style.

Partially because of Microsoft&#x27;s influence, top-posting is very common on mailing lists and in personal e-mail.

Top-posting has always been the standard format for forwarding a message to a third party, in which case the comments at the top (if any) are a &quot;cover note&quot; for the recipient.

===Bottom-posting===
In the &quot;bottom-posting&quot; style, the reply is appended to a full or partial copy of the original message. The name bottom-posting is sometimes used for inline-style replies, and indeed the two formats are the same when only one point is being replied to.

 &lt;br&gt;

 No, you won&#x27;t have to reboot.

Bottom-posting, like inline replies, encourages posters to trim the original message as much as possible, so that readers are not forced to scroll past irrelevant text, or text that they have already seen in the original message:

 &gt; [...] Will I have to reboot?

===Choosing the proper posting style===
The choice between interleaved, top and bottom posting generally depends on the forum and on the nature of the message. Some forums (such as personal e-mail) are quite tolerant, in which case the proper style is dictated by taste and effectiveness. One should consider whether the reply will be easily read by the intended recipient(s). Their e-mail interfaces may have different rules for handling quoted line markers and long lines, so a reply that looks readable in one&#x27;s screen may be jumbled and incorrectly colored on theirs. Blank lines and judicious trimming of the original text may help avoid ambiguity.

The interleaved reply style can require more work in terms of labeling lines, but possibly less work in establishing the context of each reply line. It also keeps the quotes and their replies close to each other and in logical reading order, and encourages trimming of the quoted material to the bare minimum. This style makes it easier for readers to identify the points of the original message that are being replied to; in particular, whether the reply misunderstood or ignored some point of the original text. It also gives the sender freedom to arrange the quoted parts in any order, and to provide a single comment to quotations from two or more separate messages, even if these did not include each other.

Top- and bottom-posting are sometimes compared to traditional written correspondence in that the response is a single continuous text, and the whole original is appended only to clarify which letter is being replied to. Customer service e-mail practices, in particular, often require that all points be addressed in a clear manner without quoting, while the original e-mail message may be included as an attachment. Including the whole original message may be necessary also when a new correspondent is included in an ongoing discussion. Especially in business correspondence, an entire message thread may need to be forwarded to a third party for handling or discussion. On the other hand, in environments where the entire discussion is accessible to new readers (such as newsgroups or online forums), full inclusion of previous messages is inappropriate; if quoting is necessary, the interleaved style is probably best.

If the original message is to be quoted in full, for any reason, bottom-posting is usually the most appropriate format—because it preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

It is not uncommon during discussions concerning top-posting vs. bottom-posting to hear quotes from &quot;Netiquette Guidelines (RFC 1855)&quot;. While many RFCs are vetted and approved though a committee process, some RFCs, such as RFC 1855, are just &quot;Informational&quot; and in reality, sometimes just personal opinions. (Additional information on &quot;Informational&quot; RFCs can be found in RFC 2026, under &quot;4.2.2 Informational&quot; and &quot;4.2.3 Procedures for Experimental and Informational RFCs&quot;.) The nature of RFC 1855 should be considered while reading the following discussion.

According to RFC 1855, a message can begin with an abbreviated summary; i.e. a post can begin with a paraphrasing instead of quoting selectively. Specifically, it says:

Interleaved reply combined with top-posting combines the advantages of both styles. However this also results in some portions of the original message being quoted twice, which takes up extra space and may confuse the reader.

In forwarding it is sometimes preferred to include the entire original message (including all headers) as a MIME attachment, while in top-posted replies these are often trimmed or replaced by an attribution line. An untrimmed quoted message is a weaker form of transcript, as key pieces of meta information are destroyed. (This is why an ISP&#x27;s Postmaster will typically insist on a &quot;forwarded&quot; copy of any problematic e-mail, rather than a quote.) These forwarded messages are displayed in the same way as top-posting in some mail clients. Top-posting is viewed as seriously destructive to mailing-list digests, where multiple levels of top-posting are difficult to skip. The worst case would be top-posting while including an entire digest as the original message.

Some believe that &quot;top-posting&quot; is appropriate for interpersonal e-mail, but inline posting should always be applied to threaded discussions such as newsgroups.

This example is occasionally used in mailing lists to mock and discourage top-posting:

 Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
 Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
 Top-posting.
 What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

Bottom-posting preserves the logical order of the replies and is consistent with the Western reading direction from top to bottom.

The major argument against bottom-posting is that scrolling down through a post to find a reply is inconvenient, especially for short replies to long messages, and many inexperienced computer users may not know that they need to scroll down to find a reply to their query. When sending an untrimmed bottom-posted message, one might indicate inline replies with a notice at the top such as &quot;I have replied below.&quot; However, as many modern mail programs are capable of displaying different levels of quotation with different colors (as seen in the bottom-posting example on this page), this is not so much of an issue any more. Another method to indicate that there is more reply text still to come is to always end your text with a signature line. Then a reader who is familiar with your reply style will know to continue to read until your signature line appears. This method is particularly polite and useful when using the inline reply method, since it tells the reader that your response is complete at the point where your signature line appears.

===Quoting support in popular mail clients===

This widespread policy in business communication made bottom and inline posting so unknown among most users that some of the most popular email programs no longer support the traditional posting style. For example, Microsoft Outlook (when replying to an HTML message), AOL, and Yahoo! make it difficult or impossible to indicate which part of a message is the quoted original or do not let users insert comments between parts of the original. When replying to a plain text message with Microsoft Outlook when configured to plain text mode however, Outlook properly uses Quoted line markers allowing for easy insertion of comments between parts of the original. Unfortunately however, the default mode is HTML and few users bother to change the default settings.

Yahoo! does not have the option &quot;Quote the text of the original message&quot; in Mail Classic, but this setting is retained after turning it on in All-New Mail and then switching back to Mail Classic. Inline replying is broken in Microsoft Outlook, which despite choosing the setting to prefix each line of the original with the &quot;greater-than&quot; character (&gt;) produces a blue line that makes answers inserted between quotes of an HTML email look like part of the original. The workarounds are to use the setting &quot;read all standard mail in plain text&quot;, or to use the &quot;Edit Message&quot; option on the original email and convert it to plain text before replying (then discard the edited version).

<text>Cibo Matto (, Italian for &quot;crazy food&quot;) was an American alternative rock band formed by Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori in New York City in 1994. Their first album, &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; (1996), had lyrics primarily concerned with food. For their second album, &quot;Stereo Type A&quot; (1999), they expanded into broader subject matter and recruited Sean Lennon, Timo Ellis, and Duma Love.

Honda and Hatori are Japanese expatriates. Their first album sold 40,000 copies in Japan, but was more successful in the U.S., with over 74,000 copies sold. Over time, their following in Japan grew, which resulted in their signing to Japanese record label Commmons in 2014.

After an almost decade-long hiatus, Honda and Hatori reunited in 2011, playing a series of concerts and recording new material. They released their third and final studio album, &quot;Hotel Valentine,&quot; in 2014. It reached number 168 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Cibo Matto announced their split in December 2017.

==History==
===&quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;: 1994–1996===

After working together in the noise rock band Leitoh Lychee, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda formed Cibo Matto in 1994 with Honda as the instrumentalist and Hatori as the vocalist (although occasionally Honda sang and Hatori contributed instrumentally). In 1995, Cibo Matto released a self titled EP on El Diablo Records. The EP caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records, which signed Cibo Matto later in the year. Through Warner Bros., the duo released its first major album, &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;. Cibo Matto is an Italian phrase that translates to &quot;Crazy Food&quot; and many of the tracks from &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;, which was produced by Mitchell Froom, featured lyrics related to food, including &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, and &quot;Birthday Cake&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sugar Water&quot;, was a modest college radio and dance hit. The song was accompanied by an innovative split screen music video that was directed by Michel Gondry, where each side showed the same footage—one side going forward, and one backward, meeting mid-song. After the music videos for &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot; and &quot;Sugar Water&quot; enjoyed success on MTV, Cibo Matto made appearances on various television shows such as &quot;Oddville&quot;, &quot;Viva Variety&quot;, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. &quot;Birthday Cake&quot; was heavily featured in the video game &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;. In 1996, Cibo Matto contributed &quot;Águas De Março (Waters of March)&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot;, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization.

===&quot;Stereo Type A&quot;: 1997–2001===
In 1997, Cibo Matto released a new EP entitled &quot;Super Relax&quot;, which would complete the line-up by introducing new members Sean Lennon and Timo Ellis with Duma Love joining soon thereafter. In 1998, Lennon released his debut solo album &quot;Into the Sun&quot;, which featured Hatori (&quot;Into the Sun&quot;, &quot;Sean&#x27;s Theme&quot;) and Ellis (&quot;Mystery Juice&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Spaceship&quot;). &quot;Into the Sun&quot; was produced and inspired by Honda (whom Lennon was dating at the time). Honda, Hatori, Ellis and Love appeared in the closing scene of the video for Lennon&#x27;s single &quot;Home&quot;. Cibo Matto went on to release its second album &quot;Stereo Type A&quot; in 1999. Although it was a departure from the familiar sound of &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;, &quot;Stereo Type A&quot; was well received by music critics. That year the band performed with Luscious Jackson at The Opera House in Toronto.

===Hiatus: 2002–2010===
Cibo Matto continued to play live and tour until disbanding in 2002. Honda said: &quot;We felt the need to move to the next step. It was a healthy decision, though it was sad at the same time. Things just need to grow out of things sometimes.&quot; All of the members of Cibo Matto went on to release solo material. A compilation entitled &quot;Pom Pom: The Essential Cibo Matto&quot; was released in 2007.

===Reunion and &quot;Hotel Valentine&quot;: 2011–2017===
Cibo Matto announced its reunion on March 18, 2011, to perform as part of a benefit concert for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The concert, which took place on March 27 at Columbia University in New York City, also included Yoko Ono, John Zorn, Sonic Youth, and Mike Patton. Following the success of this show, a second was added, this time featuring the Plastic Ono Band and Patti Smith along with Cibo Matto.

The group appeared at the Hollywood Bowl on June 26, 2011, for another benefit, alongside Yellow Magic Orchestra.

On May 16, 2011, Cibo Matto announced its US reunion tour titled &quot;Yeah, Basically Cibo Matto&quot; with a tour Web site and promotional video. During the concerts, the band reportedly spoke about a new studio album that was to be released in 2012. On July 17, 2012, the band announced it would be opening for Wilco at one of its shows. The band included Yuko Araki on drums during this time.

On June 15, 2013, the band played the Meltdown Festival in London and announced that its new album would be released in 2014. While the performance also featured Yoko Ono on &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot;, the group also played new songs titled &quot;MFN&quot;, &quot;Check In&quot;, and &quot;Tenth Floor Ghost Girl&quot;. On December 11, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reported that &quot;Hotel Valentine&quot; would be released on February 14, 2014 (Valentine&#x27;s Day), and that Cibo Matto had shared its music video for &quot;MFN&quot;. &quot;Hotel Valentine&quot; peaked at number 168 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2014, the band signed with Japanese label Commmons. This new relationship resulted in several live dates in Japan including Summer Sonic Festival 2014 and shows at Blue Note Jazz Club Nagoya and Blue Note Jazz Club Tokyo.

In September 2014, Cibo Matto released a teaser video announcing their Fall Flavor Tour and a new music video. Rioux opened for multiple US shows. Nels Cline (of Wilco) also performed with the group on tour. The music video for &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; was released on September 18, 2014 in collaboration with New York City-based director Jean Claude Billmaier and creative house Marabigo. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; identified the video as &quot;a colorful, datamosh-y new video&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot; as a &quot;stylish bubblegum pop-meets-digital-disaster (intentional)&quot;.

Cibo Matto completed two small tours in 2015; an &quot;Avocado Tour&quot; of Japan and a &quot;Banana Split Tour&quot; across the eastern US and Canada. On December 11, 2017, Cibo Matto announced their breakup, explaining that this was a &quot;necessary and positive change&quot;.

<text>Zebulon Baird Vance (May 13, 1830 – April 14, 1894) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 37th and 43rd governor of North Carolina, a U.S. Senator from North Carolina, and a Confederate officer during the American Civil War.

A prolific writer and noted public speaker, Vance became one of the most influential Southern leaders of the Civil War and Reconstruction Era periods. As a leader of the New South, Vance favored the rapid modernization of the Southern economy, railroad expansion, school construction, and reconciliation with the North. In addition, he frequently spoke out against antisemitism. Considered progressive by many during his lifetime, Vance was also a slave owner and is now regarded as a racist by some modern historians and biographers.

==Early life==

Vance was born in a log cabin in the settlement of Reems Creek in Buncombe County, North Carolina near present-day Weaverville, and was baptized at the Presbyterian Church on Reems Creek. He was the third of eight children of Mira Margaret Baird and David Vance Jr., a farmer and innkeeper. His paternal grandfather, David Vance, was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons and a colonel in the American Revolutionary War, serving under George Washington at Valley Forge. His maternal grandfather was Zebulon Baird, a state senator from Buncombe County, North Carolina. His uncle was Congressman Robert Brank Vance, namesake of his elder brother, Congressman Robert B. Vance. He was reared by Venus, a house slave.

Around 1833, the Vance family moved to Lapland, now Marshall, North Carolina. There, David Vance operated a stand, providing drovers with provisions as they moved hogs and other animals along the Buncombe Turnpike to markets to the south and east. Although frequently short of cash, the family enslaved as many as eighteen people. Vance&#x27;s family had an unusually large library for its era and location, left to them by an uncle.

At the age of six, Vance attended schools operated by M. Woodson, Esq., first at Flat Creek and, later, on the French Broad River. Both were far enough from home that he had to board with others. He also was a student at a school in Lapland run by Jane Hughey.

While a youth, Vance broke his thigh when he fell from a tree. This was treated by confining Vance in a box, as was common medical care at the time. As a result of this injury, his right leg was shorter, requiring him to wear a taller heel on the right shoe. Even so, it was said that Vance had &quot;a peculiar and slightly ambling gait&quot;.

When he was thirteen years old in fall 1843, Vance went to the Washington College in Tennessee. In January 1844, his father died from a construction accident, forcing Vance to withdraw before the school year was over. Mira Vance sold much of the family&#x27;s property to pay her husband&#x27;s many debts and to support her seven children. As one writer noted, the family was &quot;embarrassed with debt&quot;. She moved her family to nearby Asheville, bringing along enslaved women and children as household workers. However, the family still lacked the money to send Vance back to school in Tennessee. Instead, Vance and his brother Robert attended Newton Academy in Asheville.

To help support his family, Vance worked for John H. Patton as a hotel clerk in Warm Springs, now Hot Springs, North Carolina. In Asheville, Vance studied law under attorney John W. Woodfin. When he was 21 years old, Vance wrote to a family friend, David L. Swain, asking for a loan to study law in college. Swain was a former North Carolina governor and then president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Swain was also an elementary schoolmate of Vance&#x27;s mother. Swain arranged for a $300 loan for Vance from the university.

Vance attended University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill starting in July 1851 and had a &quot;brilliant academic year&quot;. One of his classmates, Major James W. Wilson, recalled Vance&#x27;s arrival in Chapel Hill with &quot;homemade shoes and clothes, about three inches of between pants and shoes, showing his sturdy ankles...&quot; Another classmate, Kemp P. Battle, wrote Vance &quot;had a brain large and active; a memory tenacious, a nature overflowing with joyous love of fun, and to a surprising degree accurate information of many subjects and many authors.&quot; While at the university, Vance was a member of the Dialectic Society, which helped improve his oratory skills, as well as his ability to speak extemporarily. He also joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Vance received an LL.D in 1852 and repaid the loan from the university with interest.

Vance then went to Raleigh, where he studied law with Judge William Horn Battle of the North Carolina Supreme Court and Samuel F. Phillips, former Solicitor General of the United States.

==Pre-Civil War career==
=== Attorney ===

On January 1, 1852, Vance was admitted to the North Carolina Bar and received his county court license in Raleigh. He returned to Asheville where he practiced law. Vance said, &quot;I went out to Court horseback, and carried a pair of saddle bags with a change of shirts and the North Carolina Form book...&quot; Almost immediately, the Buncombe County magistrates elected Vance as Solicitor of the Court of Pleas. He was admitted to the state&#x27;s superior courts in 1853. In 1858, he became partners with attorney William Caleb Brown.

Although he did not always prepare fully for cases, Vance was skilled at reading the jury and remembering every detail of testimony. However, his success in court &quot;was usually the result of wit, humor, boisterous eloquence, and clever retorts, not knowledge of the law.&quot;

=== North Carolina Senate ===
After canvassing for Whig presidential candidate Winfield Scott in 1852, Vance became interested in his entry into politics. In 1853, he was a delegate representing Buncombe County at a railroad convention in Cumberland Gap, Tennessee. The goal of the convention was to convince the Charleston and Cincinnati Railroad to build a route through the mountains in Western North Carolina.

Next, Vance ran as a Whig candidate for the North Carolina Senate, winning with a term starting in December 1854. Vance was a Whig in the mode of Henry Clay. He wrote, &quot;I was raised in the Whig faith, and taught to revere the names of Clay, Webster, and other great leaders of that party.&quot; Whig policies were more beneficial to Western North Carolina and its smaller farms where Vance was from, while the Democratic Party of that era tended to advocate for the owners of large slave plantations found in Eastern North Carolina.

While in the legislature, Vance worked on issues related to transportation in Western North Carolina, including introducing a bill for a public road in Yancey County and another bill to authorize subscriptions to fund the French Broad and Greenville Railroad. He also supported extending the Western North Carolina Railroad into the state&#x27;s mountain counties, favoring a route that would take the tracks to Knoxville, Tennessee by way of Asheville, North Carolina.

When the Whig Party collapsed over the issue of slavery in 1854, Vance refused to join the primarily Southern Democratic Party or the anti-slavery Republicans, ultimately settling on the American Party or Know-Nothings. However, Vance lost his campaign for reelection to the North Carolina Senate in 1856 to David Coleman.

=== Journalism ===
In March 1855, John D. Hyman of the Asheville &quot;Spectator&quot; convinced Vance to join the newspaper as an editorial assistant. He predicted that Vance would have &quot;a brilliant career in the editorial line&quot;. This weekly newspaper was published from 1853 to 1858 and was the leading Whig paper in the region. One of the stories Vance wrote was about the search for Dr. Elisha Mitchell who disappeared in June 1857, having fallen to his death while trying to prove which peak was the highest in North Carolina. Mitchell taught Vance geology at the University of North Carolina, and Vance immediately volunteered for the search party. His account of the search, published in the &quot;Spectator&quot; in July 1857, is considered the most complete record of the tragic event.

Vance stopped working as joint editor of the &quot;Spectator&quot; after a year, but became half-owner of the newspaper. However, Hyman&#x27;s steadfast support of Vance in the &quot;Spectator&quot; was a huge help to Vance&#x27;s political career. The opposition paper, the Asheville &quot;News&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Vance is the &quot;Spectator&quot;&#x27;s specialty, and at every mention of his name it sputters and snaps and snarls like a cat with its tail in a steel trap. To question the correctness of his views on a public issue, the &quot;Spectator&quot; seems to regard as little short of treason.&quot;

=== U.S. Congress ===

In 1858, Vance ran for a seat in the U.S. Congress opened by the resignation of Thomas Lanier Clingman. For this campaign, he went on a fifteen-county speaking tour that &quot;set the mountains on fire&quot;. Vance was elected for a term starting in December 1858. At 28 years old, he was the youngest member of Congress at the time. He was reelected in 1859 over his former political opponent David Coleman.

==== Salaries and deficits ====
When Congress proposed giving a $10,000 or 25% increase in fringe benefits to each representative in the next session, Vance spoke out. He said, &quot;I do not think he [my successor] is entitled to $10,000 more for miscellaneous items than I am myself...the whole bill reminds me very much of the bills I have seen of fast young men at fashionable hotels: For two days board, $5, sundries, $50. It is like a comet, a very small body with an exceedingly great tail.&quot;

Similarly, he showed a dislike for the recurring Treasury deficit. Ignoring the figures and charts presented by his colleagues, Vance said, &quot;As we are in debt, and spending more than our income, and our income is derived principally from the tariff, we have to do one of three things; either raise that income, lower our expenses, or walk into the insolvent court and file our schedule. I do not think there is, or ever was, a political economist on earth who could deny these propositions.&quot;

==== Slavery and secession ====
While serving in Congress Vance was pro-slavery, saying in March 1860:

:Plainly and unequivocally, common sense says keep the slave where he is now—in servitude. The interest of the slave himself imperatively demands it. The interest of the master, of the United States, of the world, nay of humanity itself, says, keep the slave in his bondage; treat him humanely, teach him Christianity, care for him in sickness and old age, and make his bondage light as may be; but above all, keep him a slave and in strict subordination; for that is his normal condition; the one in which alone he can promote the interest of himself or his fellows.

Despite his support for the institution of slavery, Vance was openly against North Carolina&#x27;s secession from the union, preferring a strategy where both slavery and the union could be preserved. In writing to a friend, he advised caution about secession:

:&quot;We have everything to gain and nothing on earth to lose by delay, but by too hasty action we may take a fatal step that we never can retrace—may lose a heritage that we can never recover though we seek it earnestly and with tears.&quot;

However, Vance was in favor of a secession convention so that the people of North Carolina could make their own decision. In March 1861, Vance traveled throughout North Carolina, trying to persuade the State not to follow South Carolina by seceding. In April, he was addressing a large crowd when a telegraph was read announcing the firing on Fort Sumter and President Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 volunteers. At that moment, Vance recalled sadly changing into a secessionist, as he &quot;preferred to shed northern rather than southern blood.&quot; On the spot, he shifted his speech to a call to fight for South Carolina. After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Vance resigned from Congress and headed home to Buncombe County.

== Civil War ==

=== Soldier ===
On May 4, 1861, two weeks before North Carolina seceded, Vance raised a company of local men known as the Rough and Ready Guards and became their captain. The Rough and Ready Guards became part of Company F, 14th North Carolina Infantry, and encamped near Morganton, North Carolina. By June 1861, Vance and the 14th were in Suffolk, Virginia, helping to defend Norfolk. That August, Vance was elected colonel of the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, stationed at Fort Macon in Carteret County, North Carolina.

Vance and the 26th engaged in the Battle of New Bern in March 1862. Although outnumbered four to one, Vance&#x27;s troops held back the enemy for five hours and were the last Confederates to leave the battlefield. Vance wrote his wife praising the performance of his men.&quot; Even in their 35-mile forced retreat, Vance showed bravery. He nearly drowned swimming 75 yards across the flooded Bryce&#x27;s Creek to get boats for his men—the three soldiers who swam with him drowned.

In July 1862, Vance and the 26th fought at Malvern Hill outside of Richmond, Virginia. The Confederates were not victorious, but Vance again showed &quot;unflinching leadership&quot;. When North Carolina needed a new governor, his name was immediately mentioned.

=== Governor, 1st term ===

==== Campaign ====
In 1862, Vance ran for governor as the &quot;soldier&#x27;s candidate&quot; and easily won over secessionist Democrat William J. Johnston of Charlotte. Vance did not leave his troops to campaign, nor did he give any speeches or present a platform. Instead, he wrote a letter that was published in the Fayetteville &quot;Observer&quot; saying, &quot;If, therefore, my fellow citizens believe that I could serve the great Cause better as Governor than I am now doing, and should see proper to confer this responsibility upon me without solicitation on my part, I should not feel at liberty to decline it, however conscious of my own unworthiness.&quot;

His campaign was overseen by William W. Holden of Raleigh&#x27;s &quot;North-Carolina Standard&quot; and Edward J. Hale, of the Fayetteville &quot;Observer.&quot; Holden had been driven out of the Democratic Party in 1860 because he opposed secession.&quot;&quot; Holden, like Vance, was now a member of the Conservative Democratic Party of North Carolina, a coalition of former Whigs and Democrats who were against secession. Holden simply wrote that voters should &quot;elect the man who defended their homes&quot;, noting that Johnston was at home tending to his railroads while Vance was &quot;in the face of the foe, with his sword drawn, ready for action&quot;.&quot;&quot; It also helped that Johnston&#x27;s Democratic party could be blamed for &quot;high prices, conscription, military defeats, suffering of the soldiers, and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Vance received 54,423 of 74,871 total votes, carrying all but twelve of the state&#x27;s counties.&quot;&quot; This continues to be the largest margin of victory for a governor&#x27;s race in the history of North Carolina. Vance was serving with the 26th in the trenches at Petersburg, Virginia when he learned about the outcome of the election. He resigned his commission and traveled to Raleigh to become governor. At the time, he was 32 years old.

==== War Governor ====
For his inauguration on September 8, 1862, Vance&#x27;s old regimental band, the Johnny Rebs, performed &quot;Governor Vance&#x27;s Inauguration March&quot;.&quot;&quot; During his address, Vance said he would &quot;prosecute the war until the South obtained its independence&quot;.&quot;&quot; This helped calm the North Carolina Democrats and the Confederate government who both feared Vance would rejoin the union or withdraw from the Confederacy.&quot;&quot; General Robert E. Lee said, &quot;Vance&#x27;s oratory was worth 5,000 soldiers&quot;.

Vance&#x27;s first objective was to confine the Union troops in the eastern counties, hold the state&#x27;s main port Wilmington, and protect the Weldon Railroad.&quot;&quot; Thus, he worked with the Confederate war department to add troops at Kinston, North Carolina to protect the railroad and watch the enemy encampments.&quot;&quot; Despite Vance&#x27;s continued requests to Richmond for military reinforcements, he was ignored and North Carolina&#x27;s defenses failed when 10,000 Union troops advanced on Kinston in December 1862.&quot;&quot; To help solve the shortage of soldiers, Vance offered amnesty to all deserters who returned to service; large numbers of North Carolina&#x27;s soldiers returned to active duty in 1863.&quot;&quot;

Vance aspired to provide the state&#x27;s troops with needed food, clothing, and weapons. He also demonstrated concern for the soldiers&#x27; families. He continued to operate salt works on the coast, selling the salt at one-third of its value and distributing salt supplies to every county for meat preservation.&quot;&quot; He also proposed a welfare system and kept the textile mills operational. To achieve this, Vance relied on blockade runners to export North Carolina&#x27;s cotton abroad. This yielded funds to provide food and money for the general population and to keep the mills open; the legislature was able to issue $6,000,000 for the care of impoverished citizens and keep the mills open.&quot;&quot; The blockade runners also brought needed shoes, blankets, and medicine. Vance ensured that his state&#x27;s soldiers were kept clothed by having women and children fashion new uniforms in their homes with material manufactured in the state&#x27;s mills. As a result, North Carolina was the only state to clothe and equip its regiments during the Civil War. Vance also shared surpluses with the rest of the Confederacy; General James Longstreet&#x27;s troops received 12,000 uniforms from North Carolina after the Battle of Chickamauga.

Vance was a major proponent of individual rights and local self-government, often putting him at odds with the Confederate government. When President Jefferson Davis announced plans to indefinitely imprison Southerners suspected of &quot;disloyalty&quot; without a trial, Vance refused to deprive North Carolinians of their constitutional rights, saying he would rather recall the state&#x27;s soldiers fighting in Virginia and order them to protect his constituents by force if necessary. Davis did not risk challenging Vance; as a result, North Carolina was the only state to observe the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and keep its courts fully functional during the war.

Vance also opposed Confederate conscription practices, which became more severe as Confederate defeats mounted.&quot;&quot; He was especially against the policy that allowed plantation owners and rich businessmen to avoid fighting by paying others to serve in their place, a practice described as creating &quot;a rich man&#x27;s war and a poor man&#x27;s fight&quot;. Postwar, Vance testified in the hearing investigating George Pickett&#x27;s execution of 22 alleged Confederate deserters in the aftermath of the Battle of New Bern. He testified that the North Carolinians had joined on the understanding that they would be used only for local defense and that &quot;the Confederate government did not keep faith with these local troops, who were transfer[red] to the regular service in violation of their enlistment agreement.&quot; His testimony questioned the legality of Pickett&#x27;s decision to hang Confederate deserters who had later sided with the Union and put Pickett at risk of prosecution for war crimes.

In his unpublished autobiography, Vance stated that his main reason for supporting the Confederate government was to preserve the institution of slavery. Historian Selig Adler wrote, &quot;As war governor, Vance endeared himself forever to his people. He mitigated the horrors of war by insisting on the precedence of civil law, and stoutly protected the state from the uncomfortable militarism of the Confederate government.&quot;

=== Governor, 2nd term ===
Vance was reelected as governor in 1864, defeating former supporter, Unionist Democrat, and now peace candidate William Woods Holden.

In early April 1865, General William T. Sherman&#x27;s troops neared Raleigh, North Carolina. Vance wrote to Sherman requesting a meeting, hoping to prevent the state&#x27;s capital city from being pillaged. He requested safe conduct to discuss North Carolina surrendering to the Union. Two of Vance&#x27;s men met with Sherman; although they did not reach an agreement about ending the war, they did save Raleigh. Sherman was willing to talk to Vance, but by then Vance had been called to meet with Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet in Charlotte, North Carolina. At that meeting, the Confederate government released Vance from any obligations to defend the Confederacy.
On April 26, 1865, Vance learned that Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston had surrendered his forces to Sherman at the James Bennett farmhouse near Durham, North Carolina. On April 28, Vance gave a final proclamation to the people of his state, telling both civilians and soldiers &quot;to retire quietly in their homes, and exert themselves in preserving order&quot;.&quot;&quot; He then surrendered to General John M. Schofield in the west parlor of Blandwood Mansion in Greensboro, North Carolina on May 2, 1865. Schofield accepted Vance&#x27;s surrender and told him to go to Statesville, North Carolina where Mrs. Vance and their children were living, as he had no orders for Vance&#x27;s arrest.

Some have said that Vance left Raleigh when it was captured by Sherman and that his house in Statesville was a temporary state capitol. These claims emerged as part of a political attack against Vance by Republicans during the 1876 governor&#x27;s race. There is no evidence that Vance conducted official business in Statesville; rather, it seems he relinquished the office of governor once he left Raleigh.

On May 29, 1865, William Woods Holden, Vance&#x27;s former political opponent, was appointed governor of North Carolina by President Andrew Johnson.

=== Prisoner ===
Vance was arrested in Statesville on May 13, 1865, his 35th birthday, by General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick. Samuel Wittkowsky, the man who gave prisoner Vance a wagon ride to the train station, noted that Vance was silently shedding tears at first. Then, wiping his eyes, Vance expressed concern for his wife and children who had no money to live on and worried about the &quot;indignities&quot; that North Carolina might suffer in the aftermath of the war.

After a short imprisonment in Raleigh, Vance arrived at the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. on May 20, 1865. There, he shared a small cell with John Letcher, the former Governor of Virginia. Each man had an iron bed and chair. They had to pay for their meals which came from a local restaurant. Vance filed for parole on June 3, 1865, using President Johnson&#x27;s amnesty program. At the time, Vance&#x27;s wife was very ill, and Johnson&#x27;s sympathies lay with reuniting the family. He paroled Vance on July 6, 1865, after an imprisonment of 47 days.

Vance was formally pardoned on March 11, 1867; although no formal charges were filed against him before his arrest, during his imprisonment, or during his parole.

==Postwar career==

=== Attorney ===

After the war, Vance practiced law in Statesville briefly before moving to Charlotte, North Carolina where he formed a practice with Clement Dow and R. D. Johnson. In addition to Charlotte, he had court cases in Concord, Dallas, Lexington, Lincolnton, Monroe, and Salisbury. Among his clients was former Confederate soldier, Tom Dula, who was accused of murdering his girlfriend Laura Foster in 1866. While he succeeded in having the trial moved from Wilkesboro to Statesville, believing Dula could not receive a fair trial in Wilkes County, Dula was nevertheless convicted and, although he was given a new trial on appeal, Dula was convicted again and hanged on May 1, 1868. To the end of his life, Vance maintained that Dula was innocent. This high–profile murder is the subject of the folk song &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;.

=== Fourteenth Amendment ===
Vance and other former Confederates were banned from returning to public office by the Fourteenth Amendment of 1868. Vance was depressed during this period and resented this limitation, especially since the same amendment that kept him out of the politics he loved also granted African American men citizenship and full political rights. Around 1868, he began supporting Conservative Party politicians, using racist dialogue to gain other supporters.

In February 1868, Vance attended the North Carolina Conservation Convention, also called the Rebel Convention, in Raleigh. &quot;The Dailey Standard&quot; noted that the convention was noteworthy for its hatred of the government and formerly enslaved people. After many calls from the attendees for him to speak, Vance spontaneously talked about his lack of prejudice toward the formerly enslaved, commending their conduct and fidelity during the war. However, he affirmed his belief that only educated whites should vote in the South.

In 1870, the North Carolina legislature appointed Vance to the United States Senate, but because of the Fourteenth Amendment, he was not eligible to serve unless authorized by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress. Vance spent two years unsuccessfully petitioning the Republican-dominated Senate to seat him; he ended up resigning from the appointment.

=== Lecture circuit ===
While he was kept out of politics, Vance earned income in the lecture circuit. His first important lecture was &quot;The Duties of Defeat&quot; which he gave at the University of North Carolina&#x27;s commencement on June 7, 1866. Shortly afterward, he was speaking in venues ranging from county fairs to large lecture halls in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Baltimore. By the early 1870s, Vance had a national reputation as an outstanding platform speaker. His style &quot;was peculiarly his own&quot;. He had a remarkable ability to adapt &quot;to every type of audience using local illustrations and interest, and his keen, sparkling wit... Like Lincoln, Vance was one of the few men who could successfully combine incessant jocularity with seriousness and get credit for seriousness&quot;. Some of his popular speeches were &quot;The Humorous Side of Politics&quot; and &quot;The Demagogue&quot;. He also discussed the aspects of the Civil War in &quot;The Last Days of the War in North Carolina&quot; and &quot;The Political and Social South During the War&quot;.

====Speaking out against antisemitism====
Starting around 1870, Vance gave a speech called &quot;Scattered Nation&quot; hundreds of times, praising Jews and calling for religious tolerance and justice. Although Vance&#x27;s motives for &quot;Scattered Nation&quot; are not fully known, it was not for political gain as there were fewer than 500 Jews in North Carolina at the time and antisemitism was common. One modern writer suggests Vance&#x27;s perspective may have been impacted by his involvement with Freemasonry as this organization accepted Jews. Historian Leonard Rogoff, president of Jewish Heritage North Carolina, also notes that Vance established a relationship with Samuel Wittkowsky, a Jew and fellow Mason. When Vance was arrested, he was physically unable to walk to the train station and was only offered a mule by the federal troops; Vance was rescued from this humiliation by Wittkowsky who gave Vance a ride in his wagon. The two men&#x27;s later friendship may have impacted Vance&#x27;s perspective.

Yet, within the &quot;Scattered Nation&quot; call for tolerance to Jews, Vance also made his prejudices clear, saying, &quot;[In] contrast to the Jews, the &#x27;African negro&#x27; had contributed nothing to...the civilization of mankind&quot; and that &quot;laws and partisan courts alike have been used to force [African American men] into an equality with those whom he could not equal.&quot;

=== Governor, 3rd term ===

In 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant signed an amnesty bill that included Vance. Vance ran for an open seat in the U.S. Senate but lost to Augustus Merrimon. In 1876, Vance was elected to his third term of Governor as North Carolina. However, he only served two years of the four-year term. His swearing-in in 1877 was accompanied by festivities that began a tradition of lavish gubernatorial inaugurations in the state.

==== Education ====
As a postwar governor, Vance was considered progressive for his era. He proposed agricultural reforms, the expansion of teacher training through normal schools, and the addition of more public schools, including separate but equal access for African Americans. In his 1877 message to the legislature about creating normal schools, Vance says, &quot;A school of a similar character should be established for the education of colored teachers, the want of which is more deeply felt by the black race even than the white. In addition to the fact that it is our plain duty to make no discrimination in the matter of public education...their desire for education is an extremely credible one, and should be gratified as far as our means will permit. In short, I regard it as an unmistakable policy to imbue these black people with a hearty North Carolina feeling and make them cease to look abroad for the aids to their progress and civilization, and the protection of their rights as they have been taught to do, and teach them to look to their State instead...&quot;

Two years later, his message to the legislature announced that the Board of Education had created two normal schools—a summer institute at the University of North Carolina for white teachers and a new permanent institution, the State Colored Normal School, for black teachers at the Howard School in Fayetteville. The State Colored Normal School became Fayetteville State University.

==== Railroads ====
During his third term as governor, Vance brought the railroad to Western North Carolina, finally realizing his dream from the meeting at Cumberland Gap in 1853. In his first message to the legislature on January 13, 1877, he suggested that convicts should be sent to work on the Western North Carolina Railroad in McDowell County. Many of the state&#x27;s convicts were freed slaves arrested under North Carolina&#x27;s vagrancy laws which essentially allowed the imprisonment of those without jobs. Having found a free labor source, Vance then had to resolve a cash shortfall—the State did not have the funds to both equip and transport the convicts. He turned to J. E. Rankin, chair of the Buncombe County Commission, asking that local elites provide the needed $25,000. When Rankin sent a negative reply, Vance wrote a heated response. He then asked the Federal government.

Another problem facing Vance was that this railroad was the greatest engineering challenge east of the Rockies, requiring a climb of some in just over . One modern historian notes that the Blue Ridge railroad project became Vance&#x27;s &quot;personal crusade.&quot; Despite his ambitious goal of completing the railroad in two years, Vance wanted the convicts to be treated well. In July 1877, he wrote the Penitentiary Board when he learned that convicts working on both the Chester &amp; Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Spartanburg and Asheville Railroad had been subjected to cruel treatment, including being overworked and whipped. Vance wrote that such conditions were &quot;not to be tolerated for a moment&quot; and requested immediate punishment of those who were guilty of &quot;such disgraceful conduct.&quot; However, the state only provided seven cents a day to feed each convict and the schedule worked the men seven days a week.

Despite Vance&#x27;s intervention, at least 125 of the 558 convicts died because of inclement weather, inadequate housing, lack of food, and dangerous working conditions such as the cave-ins and accidents at the Swannanoa Tunnel that killed 21 people. Guards also shot men trying to escape. Historian Gordan McKinney says, &quot;This episode thereby qualifies as one of the most egregious industrial–construction disasters in Appalachian history.&quot; Yet, Vance continued to push for the grueling pace of work.

In his January 1879 address to the legislature, Vance acknowledged some problems with the convict labor program. However, he never acknowledged his role in the tragedy. What his voting public remembered was that the new railroad network transported supplies to farms and factories, and then to markets, helping to stimulate the economy across the state.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1878, Vance was again elected to the United States Senate where he became a leader of the Democratic Party. Although Vance fought for Southern interests while in the Senate, he showed &quot;little bitterness&quot; towards the North. As a result, he helped unify Congress which was still struggling with the discord between North and South.

Vance was reelected to the Senate in 1885 and 1891, serving until he died in 1894. During his tenure, he chaired the committee on enrolled bills, chaired the committee on privileges and elections, served on the joint committee of the library, and served on the finance committee during the McKinley Tariff debates.

==== Criticism of Reconstruction ====
In one of his earliest speeches before the Senate, Vance addressed an array of issues that had arisen during Reconstruction, in support of H.R. 2, which called for the removal of military oversight in Southern elections, the repeal of laws that gave Federal marshals control of Southern elections, and the removal of the requirement for Federal Court jurors to take the oath of allegiance. Vance said:
Peace then came—no, not peace, but the end of war came—no not the end of war, but the end of legitimate, civilized war, and for three years you dallied with us. One day we were treated as though we were in the Union, and as though we had legitimate State governments in operation; another day, we were treated as though we were out of the Union, and our State governments were rebellious usurpations...You deposed our State governments and ejected from office every official, from Governor to township constable. and remitted us to a state of chaos...You disenfranchised at least ten percent of our citizens, embracing the wisest, best, and most experienced. You enfranchised slaves, the lowest and most ignorant; and you placed them over them as leaders of a class of men who have attained to the highest positions of infamy known to modern ages...
The new governments went to work, and in a short space of four years, they plundered those eleven Southern States to the extent of $262,000,000; that is to say, they took all that we had that was amenable to larceny...It would be well enough for Republican leaders to remember that the inflexible law of compensation exists in politics as well as in other things...If we violate the laws of health we suffer bodily pains or early dissolution; if we violate the laws of society we suffer in public esteem; if we violate the laws of man we are subject to its pains and penalties; if we violate the laws of God, we will suffer the penalties of sin; if we violate the laws of nature we can reap none of the benefits which our knowledge of them now enables us to derive therefrom. So it is in politics...
Later on in his speech, Vance asked, &quot;Was it the Union you fought for or political supremacy?&quot; He pointed out that the nation has benefitted from the leadership of other political parties. He also said, &quot;To suppose the States are either unable, unwilling, or too corrupt to hold peaceful and honest elections, is to declare unmistakably that the people therein are incapable of self-government...For one, I can say, with unspeakable pride and absolute truth, that the people of North Carolina who sent me here are able, willing, and virtuous enough to fulfill these and all other higher functions of government; that they have ever done so since the keels of Raleigh&#x27;s ships first grated upon the white sands of her shores; and God helping them, they and their children will continue to do so, if not destroyed by centralization...&quot;

Vance also supported the Blair Education Bill which requested federal funding to help educate the freed slaves in the South. Although, Vance says, &quot;I admit that there is no special provision in the constitution or perhaps one looking directly toward it for public education. But the men who formed the constitution had no idea that there would be the great civil war that occurred. They had no idea that 500,000 slaves would be liberated by that war, and still less of an idea that the 500,000 slaves would be forced into...absolute equality of citizenship...They had no idea that their institutions and work of their hand would ever be committed to ignorant and unlettered Africans for protection and preservation.&quot; Vance also pointed out North Carolina&#x27;s successes in creating schools to educate the freed slaves.

In a speech on January 30, 1890, regarding Senate Bill 1121, which authorized people of color to emigrate from Southern states, Vance came close to speaking against slavery, saying, &quot;Those of us in the South who had deprecated the war and deplored the agitation which led to it, as we sat in the ashes of our own homes and scraped ourselves with potsherds of desolation, yet consoled ourselves for the slaughter of our kindred and the devastation of our fields by the reflection that this, at least, was the end; &quot;that the great original wrong committed by our fathers had at last been atoned for...&quot;&quot; [emphasis added]

Nonetheless, Vance&#x27;s racial views showed when he talked about Reconstruction. He said, &quot;The truth is, he [the former slave] began to prosper when the [Southern] whites took control. Progress for him would have been impossible under his own rule as it was for the whites. Ten more years of such government as reconstruction fixed upon the South would have made the fairest portion of the American continent a wilderness. In short, it would have been Africanized...&quot; However, Vance was &quot;glad to say that North Carolina is one of the States in the South where there is the least complaint of infringement of the colored man&#x27;s rights, either at the ballot box or in the courts of justice...That there are instances of mistreatment and occasionally of cruelty to the negros now and then occurring in the South I candidly admit and regret.&quot;

Vance also outlined his vision of the future, with a bit of sarcasm:The millennium has not yet arrived in the land of reconstruction; the reign of perfect righteousness, of absolute justice, has not yet been established south of Mason and Dixon&#x27;s line, though of course, it is in full operation north of that imaginary division. There is no suppression of the popular vote by jerrymander or otherwise; there is no purchase of the floating vote in blocks of five, no ejection of colored children from white schools or colored men from theaters and barbers chairs, and where we may hope that, in the process of time and in the spread of intelligence and increased appreciation for the virtues of the negroes, one black man may soon be sent to Congress from the North; that some railroad attorney or millionaire will make room in the Senate of the United States for the colored brother; that one colored postmaster for a white town may be appointed in the North; that in the State of Kansas, the soil so prolific in friendships for the colored man, a respectable negro, duly nominated on the Republican ticket, may receive the full vote of his party, and not be scratched almost to the point of defeat by those who love him, as he was in Topeka; that one accomplished colored man may be sent abroad to represent his country in some other land than Hayti [&quot;sic]&quot; or Liberia.In reality, Vance believed in white supremacy. He said, &quot;I am not only willing but anxious to have justice done them in everything, and to do all that may be required of me to aid them [former slaves] in the difficulties of their position; but I am not willing that they should rule my people.&quot;

==== Farmers&#x27; Alliance ====
Vance also faced a political challenge with the Farmers&#x27; Alliance in North Carolina. Some claimed Vance made concessions with this organization to gain reelection to the Senate because the Farmers&#x27; Alliance essentially served as a third political party at the time. On the flip side, Vance was accused of being insincere in his dealings with the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, such as introducing a bill on their behalf with no effort made towards getting it passed. However, from the beginning, Vance tended to side with the masses, including the farming class. In addition, both Vance and the farmers agreed on the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Furthermore, the organization&#x27;s origins in North Carolina started with Vance. Because Vance was against tariffs which he felt enriched the few and impoverished the many, he encouraged North Carolina&#x27;s farmers to organize so they could collectively defend themselves against outside forces. Later, he introduced Senate Bill 2806, aka the sub-treasury scheme, at the request of North Carolina&#x27;s first Commissioner of Agriculture, Leonidas L. Polk, who had become president of the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Industrial Union. However, after investigating the sub-treasury scheme, Vance came to believe that it was both impracticable and unconstitutional.

Although he was not on board for this solution to the farmer&#x27;s needs, Vance nevertheless praised the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance in correspondence to its president, noting, &quot;For the past six months there has been more discussion upon the condition of the farmer and matters pertaining to their interests than have taken place within ten years prior. The more of this talk, the better for the farmers. Their wrongs are so palpable that the justice of readdressing them will become more and more irresistible as the light is turned on. The policy of the farmers, being right now, is to keep within the right. Demand nothing that is illegal, ask nothing that is unreasonable.&quot; Vance also hinted that the sub-treasury scheme could be harmful to him and that the farmers should stand by their friend.

When the North Carolina legislature stated that their appointed Senator for the 1891 term should vote for the sub-treasury scheme, Vance &quot;positively and emphatically declined&quot; to agree to be elected under such constraints. Rather than give up Vance, the legislature reworded their instructions to request that Vance &quot;use all honorable means&quot; to secure financial reforms. Yet Vance was loath to accept any such conditions. In a letter written to a member of the legislature on April 1, 1897, Thomas J. Jarvis said, &quot;There is no power on earth that could induce Vance to have accepted an office under conditions which he felt could be justly held to forfeit the affection and high esteem in which he is held to the people of his State.&quot;

Vance, who was dealing with poor health at the time, wrote a letter, rather than speaking in public, about the need for Democrats to fight the Republicans who want to limit rights given by the Constitution. Vance stated that the &quot;situation is most critical&quot; and cautioned against splitting the Democratic Party into two parties as this would only benefit the Republicans. Vance also reminds everyone, &quot;Since I have been your representative in the Senate I have both spoken and voted against that unjust legislation. At home, as you know, I never ceased to expose inequalities and to advise farmers to organize for resistance to it...My unfaltering confidence is in the true farmers of North Carolina, who as members of the Alliance will, I trust, not permit their noble order and their just cause to be perverted and debased.&quot;

==== National issues ====
In national politics, Vance generally supported conservative President Grover Cleveland. He made a speech in North Carolina saying:Many of our people, it is true, have objected to Mr. Cleveland and preferred that he should not have been nominated. I confess that I was among that number. But an individual preference before the nomination of a candidate is one thing and the duty of a true man after that nomination has been fairly made is another and very different thing indeed...If we refuse to abide by the voice of the majority of our fellow Democrats, freely and unmistakably expressed in friendly convention, there is an end of all associated party effort in the government of our country; if we personally participate in that...convention and then refuse to abide by the decision of its tribunal...then there is an end of all personal honor among all men, and the confidence which is necessary to all combined efforts is forever gone.Vance opposed important legislation of the era such as the McKinley Tariff, civil service programs, the internal revenue service, and the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act—gaining a reputation as an opposition senator. Vance was also against capitalistic monopolies and the government purchasing railroads and telegraph lines, as well as a monopoly by national banks. However, he did not believe railroads or other non-government entities should be allowed to own more public land than was needed for their primary function.

Vance supported increasing the volume of currency and silver coinage; at the time, the amount of paper and coin money released could not exceed the gold in the treasury. Vance made his last speech in the Senate on September 1, 1893, speaking against House Bill 1, regarding the unconditional repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act that was approved in 1890. Although noticeably weakened from illness, Vance spoke for two hours and gave what many consider the best speech of his career. Early in the speech, Vance simply explains, &quot;When money is abundant prices are high; when money is scarce the prices of all products are low. Therefore, he that increases the abundance of money benefits the production and enhances prices and wages, and he that contracts or diminishes the amount of this money depreciates everything which is for sale, including wages...The effect upon the well-being of mankind which would follow the destruction of one-half of this currency—it is impossible to accurately describe.&quot;

== Vance and the Ku Klux Klan ==
Following the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) emerged as an organization that engaged in terrorism and intimidation throughout the South, including North Carolina. Modern detractors and some modern biographers claim that Vance was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

The first known source to connect the two is an affidavit from Thomas A. Hope of Lincoln County, North Carolina, submitted to the US Congress&#x27;s Joint Select Committee to Inquire into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, which published its report in 1872. In his affidavit, Hope states, &quot;[I] frequently heard it talked among the KKK members that Z. B. Vance was the chief of the State; do not know this of my own knowledge, have only heard it talked of.&quot;

In her 1924 self-published book, &quot;Authentic History Ku Klux Klan, 1865–1877,&quot; Susan Lawrence Davis states that Vance was the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan for North Carolina&quot;.&quot; Davis had a history of fakery and appears to have plagiarized a 1906 historical romance novel by Thomas Dixon Jr. when writing her nonfiction Klan history.&quot;&quot; Modern experts note other discrepancies in &quot;Authentic History&quot;, including fabricated descriptions of Klan costumes, giving reason to question any claims she made about Vance.

However, Davis&#x27;s report of Vance&#x27;s association with the Klan is repeated in many credible books in the 20th century, such as historian Stanly Fitzgerald Horn&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Empire: The Story of the Ku Klux Klan, 1866–1871.&quot; Horne writes, &quot;Ex-Governor Zebulon Baird Vance was generally supposed to be the Grand Dragon of the Realm, and the testimony of the confessed Ku Klux was to the effect that within the Klan Vance was generally looked upon as the chief of state.&quot;

In the 2004 biography, &quot;Zeb Vance: North Carolina&#x27;s Civil War Governor and Gilded Age Political Leader,&quot; Gordon McKinney writes that Vance did publicly discuss the KKK in 1870 after a series of Ku Klux Klan incidents in Orange County, North Carolina. The statement issued by Vance reads: &quot;I opposed the Ku Klux from the start...refusing to have anything to do with such an organization on the grounds that it was a secret society...I not only refused to approve of it but made a speech in a certain county against such organizations.&quot;

Similarly, in a review of Vance&#x27;s writings of the era, historian Milton Ready notes, &quot;[Vance] embraced the racial stereotypes of the time that deemed newly freed blacks inferior. Yet he loathed the Reconstruction-era Ku Klux Klan, condemning its members as cowards and &#x27;ruffians,&#x27; its intimidating methods as unlawful.&quot;

Regardless of what Vance was writing or saying, historian Joe T. Mobley says it is important to consider Vance&#x27;s &quot;acquiescence to the violence of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction.&quot; Vance also capitalized on &quot;the tension created by the Klan in the mountain region to help the Conservatives sweep the western counties.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Around 1851, Vance began to court Harriett &quot;Hattie&quot; Newell Espy, the orphaned daughter of Presbyterian minister Robert Espy. After he had passed the Bar and started a law practice, Vance married Harriett at Quaker Meadows, the home of her uncle Charles McDowell in Burke County, North Carolina on August 3, 1853. They had five sons: Robert Espy Vance (born 1854, died young), Charles Noel Vance (born 1856), David Mitchell Vance (born 1857), Zebulon Baird Vance Jr. (born 1860), and Thomas Malvern Vance (born 1862). The family lived on a lot in Asheville, North Carolina, purchased for $2,300 which came from Hattie&#x27;s dowry. Vance enslaved six people—Isaac, Julia, Hannah, Marion, and two unnamed children—who cleaned the house, cooked, maintained the garden, did laundry, and helped rear the Vance children.

Vance joined the Mt. Hermon Lodge No. 118 Ancient Free and Accepted Masons in Asheville, reaching the degree of Master Mason on June 20, 1853. When he moved to Charlotte after the Civil War, Vance attended Phalanx Lodge No. 31. That lodge quickly grew in size with Vance&#x27;s membership. In 1867, Vance co-founded the Excelsior Lodge No. 261 as the second lodge in Charlotte with Samuel Wittkowsky. However, Excelsior Lodge records show Vance as &quot;Resident Mason—Not Member.&quot;

Vance was also one of the nineteen original stakeholders in the Asheville Cemetery Company which purchased land and hired landscape architect Charles T. Colyer to create Riverside Cemetery. In return, Vance received twenty grave plots and his choice of location within the cemetery.

Vance donated to keep the University of North Carolina operating. In 1875 when the university reopened after the war, he was asked to be its president, following in the footsteps of former Governor David Lowry Swain. However, Vance declined the offer. He said, &quot;No, say to my friends that it would kill me in a few weeks to be obliged to behave as is required for a college president in order to furnish an example to the boys.&quot; He was a member of the Southern Historical Society, serving as its vice-president of North Carolina around 1873.

In February 1865, Vance had a stroke that caused temporary paralysis and &quot;the muscles of the left cheek and eye to occasionally jerk and twitch...&quot; In October 1878, the Vances moved into a residence on Fayetteville Street in Raleigh, the former home of Kemp P. Battle. Vance joined the church for the first time at the age of 48, choosing his wife&#x27;s Presbyterian church. However, his wife Harriett died on November 3, 1878, after a long and painful illness, just one month after the death of Vance&#x27;s mother. A train took Harriett&#x27;s remains back to Asheville to be buried at Riverside Cemetery.

On January 21, 1880, Vance met Florence Steele Martin while attending a ball at the Riggs House hotel in Washington, D.C. Martin was a wealthy Catholic widow from Louisville, Kentucky, with a twelve-year-old son. When she returned home three weeks later, the two were engaged. Based on the more than 100 letters Vance sent her over the next four months, this was a love match. Vance told a friend that Mrs. Martin was perfect for him except for her religion. He wrote, &quot;Think of it! What &quot;will&quot; my Presbyterian friends say to me?&quot; In reality, there were legitimate concerns that her religion could negatively impact his political career, but Vance was not deterred. They married on June 17, 1880, some six months after meeting, in Oldham County, Kentucky at the home of her mother, Mrs. Samuel Steele. They did not have any children.

The couple lived at 1627 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C., but also started building a house called Gombroom in Black Mountain, North Carolina. To fund Gombroom, Vance used his wife&#x27;s money and sold land in downtown Asheville that he inherited from his mother. Vance was embarrassed that his new wife had more money than he did. Weeks before their wedding, he wrote her, &quot;Tell them [her family] the simple truth about me Darling, as I told it to you—that I am a poor man &amp; ever likely to be. You may boast of nothing for me except my love for you. ...I do hope they will all learn to love me.&quot; Nevertheless, Gombroon was completed in 1887 and became their main home when Vance&#x27;s health declined. Surrounded by forests, it was &quot;the ideal retreat in the mountains of North Carolina&quot; and had gardens, orchards, and vineyards, along with a dairy, springhouse, and other outbuildings.

In 1890, at the age of sixty, Vance gave more speeches than in any other year of his life. His nervous affliction from his previous stroke became worse, and back in Black Mountain, he fell from a wagon. His doctors feared he would go blind if they did not surgically remove one eye to save the other. The surgery was performed in early 1891, but he never returned to full health. Vance told William B. Bate, whom he sat next to in the Senate, &quot;Misfortunes have their blessings, for surely no man can now deny that I have an eye single to the interests of my constituents.&quot;

In a kindness not always seen by political opponents, the entire Senate voted to pay for a private secretary for Vance from their contingency funds. However, Vance&#x27;s health continued to decline from 1890 through 1894. As travel was believed to be curative in the 19th century, he visited Egypt, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Scotland. Vance told his son that he &quot;was home-sick while abroad and that the trip had made him a better American.&quot; In January 1894, he visited Jacksonville, Tampa, St. Augustine, and Suwannee Springs in Florida while the Senate was in session. When he returned to Washington, D.C. in April 1894, he could no longer walk.

===Death and funeral===
On April 14, 1894, Vance had another stroke, went into a coma, and died at his home in Washington, D.C.

Services were held in the Senate chamber on April 16, 1894, which were attended by President Grover Cleveland, Vice President Adlai Stevenson, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Melville Fuller and all but one of the associate justices, Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham, Secretary of the Treasury John G. Carlisle, Attorney General Richard Olney, Post Master General Wilson S. Bissell, Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert, Secretary of the Interior M. Hoke Smith, Secretary of Agriculture Julius Sterling Morton, the Speaker of the House Charles Frederick Crisp, and members of both the House of Representatives and Senate. The ambassador from England Sir Julian Paunceforte, other members of the diplomatic corps, and Bishop John J. Keane of Catholic University also attended. For the service, Vance&#x27;s desk and chair were draped in black, and the floral decorations included pine to represent North Carolina. The service was followed by a funeral procession to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station.

Next, a funeral train took Vance&#x27;s body to Raleigh, North Carolina for another service, and from there to Asheville, North Carolina for burial. He was accompanied by seven congressmen (John S. Henderson, William T. Crawford, and Sydenham B. Alexander of North Carolina; John C. Black of Illinois; Elijah V. Brookshire of Indiana; Luther M. Strong of Ohio; and Charles Daniels of New York), six senators (Matt W. Ransom of North Carolina, James Z. George of Mississippi, George Gray of Delaware, Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky, Fred DuBois of Idaho, and William E. Chandler of New Hampshire), the Secretary of the Senate William Ruffin Cox, and family members. In Raleigh, the group was joined by Governor Elias Carr, former Governor Thomas Jordan Jarvis, North Carolina Attorney General Frank I. Osborne, state North Railroad Commissioner James W. Wilson, North Carolina Secretary of State Octavius Coke, State Treasurer Samuel McDowell Tate, Auditor of North Carolina R. M. Furman, Judge Alphonso Calhoun Avery of the North Carolina Supreme Court, Richard Henry Battle who was Vance&#x27;s personal secretary during his governorship, former North Carolina. Attorney General Thomas S. Kenan, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; owner Josephus Daniels, Edward J. Hale of &quot;The Fayetteville Observer,&quot; and many others.

Thousands of people lined the railroad tracks &quot;to pay their last respects to one whom they loved and admired very much&quot; as the funeral train headed south and west and stopped at towns and cities such as Richmond, Danville, Greensboro, Durham, and Raleigh. Thousands passed through the railroad car to pay their respects, filling it with a variety of flowers. Once the train arrived in Asheville, there were funeral services at First Presbyterian Church. Surviving members of Vance&#x27;s Rough and Ready Guard led a procession of 710 carriages from the church to Riverside Cemetery where nearly 10,000 mourners attended his funeral and burial, including people he formerly enslaved. In 1890, the total population of Asheville was 10,235.

In his eulogy, former Governor Thomas Jordan Jarvis said, &quot;He was the Mount Mitchell of all our great men, and in the affections and love of the people, he towered above them all. As ages to come will not be able to mar the grandeur and greatness of Mount Mitchell, so they will not be able to efface from the hearts and minds of the people the name of their beloved Vance.&quot;

Vance was buried by his first wife, Harriett, in Riverside Cemetery in the Vance family plot. Later, his second wife Florence had Vance moved to a grave in her family&#x27;s plot in Riverside Cemetery. Vance&#x27;s children, who were all born to his first wife, successfully petitioned to court to return Vance to his original burial site. Thus, Vance was buried three times in the same cemetery.

At the time of his death, Vance had $152.07 in the bank; when his effects and property were sold, his estate totaled less than $5,000.

== Honors ==

In 1953, Frontis W. Johnston wrote, &quot;North Carolina has loved, idolized, and rewarded no other man in her history as she has Zebulon Baird Vance.&quot; Johnston also states that North Carolina&#x27;s towns &quot;swarmed with literally hundreds of little Zebulons.&quot;

== Legacy ==
About Vance, F. Lane Williamson wrote, &quot;Did he moderate his racial views in later years? Perhaps, but who knows? It&#x27;s fair to say, though, that his legacy is that he set the stage for North Carolina to be perceived as at least somewhat more racially tolerant and culturally progressive than its Deep South neighbors, a tradition that held through the 20th–century and beyond until quite recently.&quot;

Samuel Wittkowsky, a Jewish intimate of Vance, wrote, &quot;I speak for my race in North Carolina...the deceased has even by his words and writings demonstrated that he was their friend. His lecture on the Scattered Nation will ever remain green in the memory of my race, and will be one of the brightest jewels in his ever-liberal, fair, and untarnished escutcheon. And I venture the assertion that in the history of North Carolina, no Israelite has cast a vote against Z. B. Vance.&quot; Annually on Vance&#x27;s birthday for more than 75 years, the Jewish organization, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy held a joint ceremony and laid a galax wreath at the Vance Monument in Asheville. This event began in the late 1930s was discontinued in the early 2000s.

In 2004, author Sharyn McCrumb wrote the novel &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; with a fictionalized account of Vance&#x27;s life told in the first person. She was also inspired to write &quot;The Ballad of Tom Dula&quot; because of Vance, saying &quot;Despite his family&#x27;s hard times after the early death of his father, Zeb Vance managed to get an education, read law, and get himself elected governor by the age of thirty. I thought that Vance could counteract the [negative Appalachian] stereotypes...&quot;

Always a controversial political figure, Vance became even more of an issue in the early 21st century because of his connection to slavery and his history of racism. In September 2017, the University of North Carolina at Asheville&#x27;s Department of History and the Zebulon B. Vance Birthplace State Historic Site held a two-day symposium, &quot;Zebulon B. Vance Reconsidered.&quot; Kimberly Floyd, site manager of the Vance Birthplace and symposium co-convener said, &quot;Zebulon Vance was a prominent figure in our state for four decades, and his is the story of both a hero and scoundrel.&quot; In August 2020, the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina at Asheville voted to rename Vance Hall because Vance &quot;maintained racist stances that do not align with UNC Asheville&#x27;s core values.&quot; In October 2020, the Charlotte–Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education voted to remove his name from its high school. In 2021, the City of Asheville and Buncombe County both voted to remove the Vance Monument from Pack Square in downtown Asheville. Also in 2021, Asheville City Schools changed the name of its Vance Elementary School.

<text>A semi-automatic shotgun is a repeating shotgun with a semi-automatic action, i.e. capable of automatically chambering a new shell after each firing, but requires individual trigger-pull to manually actuate each shot. Semi-automatic shotguns use gas operation, blowback, or recoil operation to cycle the action, eject the empty shell, and load another round. The first semi-automatic shotgun was the Automatic-5 by Browning.

Many semi-automatic shotguns also provide an optional manual means of operation such as by pump action or a charging handle.

<text>West Asia (also called Western Asia or Southwest Asia) is the westernmost region of Asia. As defined by most academics, UN bodies and other institutions, the subregion consists of Anatolia, the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Mesopotamia, the Armenian highlands, the Levant, the island of Cyprus, the Sinai Peninsula and the South Caucasus. The region is separated from Africa by the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt, and separated from Europe by the waterways of the Turkish Straits and the watershed of the Greater Caucasus. Central Asia lies to its northeast, while South Asia lies to its east. Twelve seas surround the region (clockwise): the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Gulf of Suez, and the Mediterranean Sea. West Asia contains the majority of the similarly defined Middle East. The Middle East is a political term that has changed many times depending on political and historical context while West Asia is a geographical term with more consistency. It excludes most of Egypt and the northwestern part of Turkey, and includes the southern part of the Caucasus.

West Asia covers an area of , with a population of about 313 million. Of the 20 UN member countries fully or partly within the region, 13 are part of the Arab world. The most populous countries in West Asia are Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

In the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD), West Asia excludes the Arabian Peninsula and includes Afghanistan. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) excludes Egypt and includes Afghanistan. The United Nations Environment Programme excludes Cyprus, Israel, Turkey, and Iran from West Asia.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;West Asia&quot; is used pragmatically and has no &quot;correct&quot; or generally accepted definition. Its typical definitions overlap substantially, but not entirely, with definitions of the terms Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, and Near East (which is historically familiar but widely deprecated today). The &quot;National Geographic Style Manual&quot; as well as Maddison&#x27;s &quot;The World Economy: Historical Statistics&quot; (2003) by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) include only Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Palestine (called West Bank and Gaza in the latter), Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, UAE, and Yemen as West Asian countries. By contrast, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in its 2015 yearbook includes Armenia and Azerbaijan, and excludes Israel (as Other) and Turkey (as Europe).

Unlike the UNIDO, the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) excludes Iran from West Asia and includes Turkey, Georgia, and Cyprus in the region. In the United Nations geopolitical Eastern European Group, Armenia and Georgia are included in Eastern Europe, whereas Cyprus and East Thracian Turkey are in Southern Europe. These three nations are listed in the European category of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).

National members of West Asian sports governing bodies are limited to Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The Olympic Council of Asia&#x27;s multi-sport event West Asian Games are contested by athletes representing these 13 countries. Among the region&#x27;s sports organisations are the West Asia Basketball Association, West Asian Billiards and Snooker Federation, West Asian Football Federation, and the West Asian Tennis Federation.

== History ==
&quot;Western Asia&quot; was in use as a geographical term in the early 19th century, before &quot;Near East&quot; became current as a geopolitical concept. In the context of the history of classical antiquity, &quot;Western Asia&quot; could mean the part of Asia known in classical antiquity, as opposed to the reaches of &quot;interior Asia&quot;, i.e. Scythia, and &quot;Eastern Asia&quot; the easternmost reaches of geographical knowledge in classical authors, i.e. Transoxania and India. In the 20th century, &quot;Western Asia&quot; was used to denote a rough geographical era in the fields of archaeology and ancient history, especially as a shorthand for &quot;the Fertile Crescent excluding Ancient Egypt&quot; for the purposes of comparing the early civilizations of Egypt and the former.

Use of the term in the context of contemporary geopolitics or world economy appears to date from at least the mid-1960s.

== Geography ==

The region is surrounded by eight major seas; the Aegean Sea, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.

To the northwest and north, the region is delimited from Europe by the Turkish Straits and drainage divide of the Greater Caucasus, to the southwest, it is delimited from Africa by the Isthmus of Suez, while to the northeast and east, the region adjoins Central Asia and South Asia. The region is located east of Southern Europe and south of Eastern Europe.

The Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut deserts in eastern Iran naturally delimit the region from Balochistan and South Asia.

=== Geology ===
==== Plate tectonics ====
Three major tectonic plates converge on West Asia, including the African, Eurasian, and Arabian plates. The boundaries between the tectonic plates make up the Azores-Gibraltar Ridge, extending across North Africa, the Red Sea, and into Iran. The Arabian Plate is moving northward into the Anatolian plate (Turkey) at the East Anatolian Fault, and the boundary between the Aegean and Anatolian plate in eastern Turkey is also seismically active.

==== Water resources ====
Several major aquifers provide water to large portions of West Asia. In Saudi Arabia, two large aquifers of Palaeozoic and Triassic origins are located beneath the Jabal Tuwayq mountains and areas west to the Red Sea. Cretaceous and Eocene-origin aquifers are located beneath large portions of central and eastern Saudi Arabia, including Wasia and Biyadh which contain amounts of both fresh water and saline water. Flood or furrow irrigation, as well as sprinkler methods, are extensively used for irrigation, covering nearly across West Asia for agriculture. Also, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers contribute very well.

=== Climate ===


West Asia is primarily arid and semi-arid, and can be subject to drought, but it also contains vast expanses of forest and fertile valleys. The region consists of grasslands, rangelands, deserts, and mountains. Water shortages are a problem in many parts of West Asia, with rapidly growing populations increasing demands for water, while salinization and pollution threaten water supplies. Major rivers, including the Tigris and Euphrates, provide sources for irrigation water to support agriculture.

There are two wind phenomena in West Asia: the &quot;sharqi&quot; and the &quot;shamal&quot;. The &quot;sharqi&quot; (or &quot;sharki&quot;) is a wind that comes from the south and southeast. It is seasonal, lasting from April to early June, and comes again between late September and November. The winds are dry and dusty, with occasional gusts up to 80 kilometres per hour (50 miles per hour) and often kick up violent sand and dust storms that can carry sand a few thousand meters high, and can close down airports for short periods of time. These winds can last for a full day at the beginning and end of the season, and for several days during the middle of the season. The &quot;shamal&quot; is a summer northwesterly wind blowing over Iraq and the Persian Gulf states (including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), often strong during the day, but decreasing at night. This weather effect occurs anywhere from once to several times a year.

=== Topography ===
West Asia contains large areas of mountainous terrain. The Anatolian Plateau is sandwiched between the Pontus Mountains and Taurus Mountains in Turkey. Mount Ararat in Turkey rises to . The Zagros Mountains are located in Iran, in areas along its border with Iraq. The Central Plateau of Iran is divided into two drainage basins. The northern basin is Dasht-e Kavir (Great Salt Desert), and Dasht-e-Lut is the southern basin.

In Yemen, elevations exceed in many areas, and highland areas extend north along the Red Sea coast and north into Lebanon. A fault zone also exists along the Red Sea, with continental rifting creating trough-like topography with areas located well below sea level. The Dead Sea, located on the border between the West Bank, Israel, and Jordan, is situated at below sea level, making it the lowest point on the surface of the Earth.

Rub&#x27; al Khali, one of the world&#x27;s largest sand deserts, spans the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula in Saudi Arabia, parts of Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Jebel al Akhdar is a small range of mountains located in northeastern Oman, bordering the Gulf of Oman.

== Demographics ==
The population of West Asia was estimated at 272 million as of 2008, projected to reach 370 million by 2030 by Maddison (2007; the estimate excludes the Caucasus and Cyprus).
This corresponds to an annual growth rate of 1.4% (or a doubling time of 50 years), well above the world average of 0.9% (doubling time 75 years).
The population of West Asia is estimated at 4% of world population, up from about 39 million at the beginning of the 20th century, or about 2% of world population at the time.

The most populous countries in the region are Turkey and Iran, each with around 79 million people, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia with around 33 million people each, and Yemen with around 29 million people.

Numerically, West Asia is predominantly Arab, Persian, Turkish, and the dominating languages are correspondingly Arabic, Persian and Turkish, each with of the order of 70 million speakers, followed by smaller communities of Kurdish, Azerbaijani, Hebrew, Armenian and Neo-Aramaic. The dominance of Arabic and Turkish is the result of the medieval Arab and Turkic invasions beginning with the Islamic conquests of the 7th century AD, which displaced the formerly dominant Aramaic in the region of Syria, and Greek in Anatolia, although Hebrew became the dominant language in Israel in the second half of the 20th century, and Neo-Aramaic (spoken by modern Arameans and Assyrians) and Greek both remain present in their respective territories as minority languages.

Significant native minorities include, in alphabetical order: Arameans, Assyrians, Druze, Jews, Lurs, Mandeans, Maronites, Shabaks and Yezidis.

== Religion ==

Four major religious groups (i.e. the two largest religions in the world: Christianity and Islam, plus Judaism and Druze faith) originated in West Asia. Islam is the largest religion in West Asia, but other faiths that originated there, such as Judaism and Christianity, are also well represented.

In Armenia and Georgia, Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy respectively are the predominant religions. Eastern Orthodoxy is also the majority religion in Cyprus. There are still large ancient communities of Eastern Christians (such as Assyrians, Middle Eastern Christians and Arab Christians) in Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Palestine numbering more than 3 million in West Asia. There are also large populations of expatriate workers which include sizeable Christian communities living in the Arabian Peninsula numbering more than 3 million. Christian communities have played a vital role in West Asia.

Judaism is the predominant religion in Israel, and there are small ancient Jewish communities in West Asia such as in Turkey (14,300), Azerbaijan (9,100), and Iran (8,756).

The Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia. It is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-&#x27;Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% living in Syria, 35% to 40% living in Lebanon, and less than 10% living in Israel; recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.

There are also important minority religions like the Baháʼí Faith, Yarsanism, Yazidism, Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, and Shabakism.


== Economy ==
The economy of West Asia is diverse and the region experiences high economic growth. Turkey has the largest economy in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia and Iran. Petroleum is the major industry in the regional economy, as more than half of the world&#x27;s oil reserves and around 40 percent of the world&#x27;s natural gas reserves are located in the region.

<text>The Minister of Foreign Affairs, also known as the Foreign Minister, is a senior minister in the New Zealand Government heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and responsible for relations with foreign countries.

The current Minister of Foreign Affairs is Winston Peters.

==Responsibilities and powers==
The Minister of Foreign Affairs is responsible for overseeing New Zealand&#x27;s relations with foreign countries and the promotion of New Zealand&#x27;s interests abroad. The Minister is in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including New Zealand&#x27;s diplomatic staff. The office is often considered to be one of the more distinguished ministerial posts, and has at times been counted as the most senior role below that of the Prime Minister. In terms of actual political power, however, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is not as prominent as in countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, with the Minister of Finance being considerably more influential.

==History==
The first New Zealand foreign minister was James Allen, appointed to the post of Minister of External Affairs by William Massey in 1919. Before this time, there was no dedicated ministerial portfolio for foreign relations. A Department of External Affairs was created in 1919 but its functions were limited to administering New Zealand&#x27;s Island Territories in the Pacific; namely the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the League of Nations Mandate of Samoa. In 1943, a new Department of External Affairs was created to conduct the country&#x27;s external relations. The older department was then renamed the Department of Island Territories and a separate portfolio called the Minister of Island Territories was subsequently created.

From 1943, the Minister of External Affairs became the main ministerial portfolio for conducting New Zealand&#x27;s external relations. Like its similarly named Australian and Canadian counterparts, the portfolio was called &quot;External Affairs&quot; rather than &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; in deference of the British Government&#x27;s responsibility for conducting foreign policy on behalf of the British Empire and later the Commonwealth of Nations. The title was changed to Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1970 after the Department was renamed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1993, the portfolio was merged with the trade portfolio (except for trade negotiations, which were a separate responsibility) as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In 2005, responsibility for trade was returned to a separate portfolio and the title of &quot;Minister of Foreign Affairs&quot; was restored.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs is usually a senior member of the Cabinet. The portfolio has been held by 13 prime ministers, including Peter Fraser, Walter Nash, Keith Holyoake, David Lange and Mike Moore, and has been assigned to the deputy prime minister on four occasions. Only once has the foreign minister sat outside of Cabinet (Winston Peters between 2005 and 2008).

New Zealand has had 29 foreign ministers (regardless of exact title). The longest-serving was Keith Holyoake, who held the post for the duration of his 11-year premiership. The second longest-serving, and the longest-serving who was not also prime minister, was Don McKinnon, who later became Commonwealth Secretary-General.

<text>Seymour Ivan Rubinstein (born 1934) is an American businessman and software developer. With the founding of MicroPro International in 1978, he became a pioneer of personal computer software, publishing the popular word processing package, WordStar. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and after a six-year stint in New Hampshire, later moved to California. Programs developed under his direction include WordStar, HelpDesk, Quattro Pro, and WebSleuth, among others. WordStar was the first truly successful program for the personal computer in a commercial sense and gave reasonably priced access to word processing for the general population for the first time.

Rubinstein began his involvement with microcomputers as director of marketing at IMSAI.

== Early career ==
During his teenage years, Rubinstein was a television repairman. After his military service he became a technical writer and continued his undergraduate studies at night.

In 1964, he was given the opportunity to participate in the design and implementation a classified system for identifying unknown vessels at sea by their sound fingerprint. Following his success with this and other related projects, he moved to New Hampshire to be put in charge of the computer software development for a line of IBM compatible programmable CRT terminals. As part of this assignment, Rubinstein went to San Francisco. Two years later, Rubinstein moved to the Bay Area and landed an assignment to implement a law office management system on a Varian Data Machines minicomputer. Following this, he formed the Systems Division of Prodata International Corporation which was subsequently acquired by Varian Data Machines. As a consequence, Rubinstein temporarily moved to Zürich, Switzerland to utilize the technology he developed as part of a branch banking system for Credit Suisse.

Upon his return to California, he visited the Byte Shop of San Rafael and began his love affair with the microcomputer.

== Business ventures ==
Rubinstein founded MicroPro International Corporation in June 1978. Subsequently, Rubinstein made an arrangement with Rob Barnaby, a programmer Rubinstein met at IMSAI. While at IMSAI, Barnaby wrote a screen editor which was called NED. Rubinstein had Barnaby totally rewrite NED into a new product, WordMaster. MicroPro was officially launched in September, 1978 using Barnaby&#x27;s first two programs, WordMaster and SuperSort. Feedback from the computer store dealers, who were MicroPro&#x27;s first customers, said they wanted a program with integrated printing.

Rubinstein developed the specifications for the new program including many innovations unavailable in commercial word processing at the time, such as showing page breaks, providing an integrated help system and a keyboard design specifically for touch typists. Barnaby did the initial foundation for MailMerge, which was finished by others.

In mid-1979 was born the Wordstar word processor. A year and a half later, several IMSAI employees joined Rubinstein at Micropro, including Bruce H. Van Natta, A. Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Killian, Dianne Hajicek, and Glenn Ewing.

In 1982, WordStar was ported to DOS.

&quot;So while WordMaster, SuperSort, and WordStar were developed on IMSAIs (I used mine til I got an IBM PC), few customers used them.&quot;
&quot;-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 2 May 2000&quot;

In 1987 Rubinstein became involved with a spreadsheet he called Surpass. This spreadsheet was later sold to Borland International, which renamed it Quattro Pro.

In 1990 Rubinstein was sued by Bill Millard, former CEO of IMSAI, regarding theft of trade secrets regarding WordStar. Rubinstein was successfully defended by Davis Wright Tremaine .

In a Video History Interview with David Allison of the Smithsonian Institution, Bill Gates referred to Rubinstein as starting one of the first software companies .

In 1992 he founded UDICO Holdings, a company which, using a &quot;surveillance engine&quot; licensed from a French company, sought to create an interactive context sensitive help engine which would intercept &quot;F1&quot; calls for help within Microsoft Word and direct users at that point to an interactive training session for the feature which they sought help with. Though this product (Developed by T. Lindgren and A. Bennedsen) was never released, the company did release a WinHelp authoring tool called W.Y.S.I. Help Composer.

In 1995 he founded a company called Prompt Software to investigate document management, internet research, and worked with Garnet R. Chaney to patent a series of discoveries regarding Content Discovery. This software connected to multiple search sites and used complex word algorithms to refine searches.

<text>A Centauro event is a kind of anomalous event observed in cosmic-ray detectors since 1972. They are so named because their shape resembles that of a centaur: i.e., highly asymmetric.

If some versions of string theory are correct, then high-energy cosmic rays could create black holes when they collide with molecules in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These black holes would be tiny, with a mass of around 10 micrograms. They would also be unstable enough to explode in a burst of particles within around 10−27 seconds.

Theodore Tomaras, a physicist at the University of Crete in Heraklion, Greece, and his Russian collaborators hypothesize that these miniature black holes could explain certain anomalous observations made by cosmic-ray detectors in the Bolivian Andes and on a mountain in Tajikistan.

In 1972, the Andean detector registered a cascade that was strangely rich in charged, quark-based particles; far more particles were detected in the bottom portion of the detector than in the top portion.

In years since, the detectors in Bolivia and Tajikistan have detected more than 40 Centauro events. Various explanations have been suggested. One possible explanation might be if the strong force between particles behaves unusually when they have extremely high energies.

Exploding black holes are also a possibility. The team calculated what signal a detector would register if a cosmic ray creates a miniature black hole that explodes nearby. The researchers&#x27; prediction is consistent with the observed Centauro events.

The Tomaras team hopes that computer simulations of mini-black holes exploding, and further observations, will solve the puzzle.

== Solution to the Centauro puzzle ==

In 2003 an international team of researches from Russia and Japan
found out that the mysterious observation from mountain-top 
cosmic ray experiments can be explained with conventional 
physics.

The new analysis of Centauro I reveals that there is a 
difference in the arrival angle between the upper block and lower block events, 
so the two are not products of the same interaction.
That leaves only the lower chamber data connected to the Centauro I event.
In other words, the man-horse analogy becomes redundant.
There is only an obvious &quot;tail&quot;, and no &quot;head&quot;.
The original detector setup had gaps between neighboring blocks 
in the upper chamber.
Linear dimensions of gaps were comparable to the geometrical
size of the event.
The signal observed in the lower detector was similar to an 
ordinary interaction occurred at low altitude above the chamber, 
thus providing a natural solution:
passing of a cascade of particles through a gap 
between the upper blocks.

In 2005 it was shown that &quot;other Centauro events&quot; can be explained by
peculiarities of the Chacaltaya detector.
So-called &quot;exotic signal&quot; observed so far in cosmic ray experiments
using a traditional X-ray emulsion chamber detector can
be consistently explained within the framework of standard physics.

<doc id="399667" wikidata="Q842803" url="?curid=399667" title="Zemstvo">
<text>A zemstvo (, , , &quot;zemstva&quot;) was an institution of local government set up in consequence of the emancipation reform of 1861 of Imperial Russia by Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Nikolay Milyutin elaborated the idea of the zemstvo, and the first zemstvo laws went into effect in 1864. After the October Revolution of 1917 the zemstvo system was shut down by the Bolsheviks and replaced with a multilevel system of workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; councils (&quot;soviets&quot;).

== History ==
Zemstvos were created as part of the larger Great Reforms with the specific goal of creating organs of elected, local self-government. The existing system of local self-government in the Russian Empire was represented at the lowest level by the mir and at the regional level by the volost. These institutions continued during the zemstvo period; however, they were seen as insufficient, due to their lack of independent authority. In 1864, the first law on zemstvos was enacted by the Emperor, a law that outlined the powers of the zemstvos. These powers were administrative and focused on local issues that were not being addressed by existing institutions.

In 1865, zemstvos were established in nineteen provinces, and between 1866 and 1876 another sixteen were established, for a total of 35 zemstvos in European Russia and Bessarabia, with some exceptions: there were no zemstvos in the three Baltic governorates, the nine western governorates annexed from Poland by Catherine II, in most of Caucasus, and in Finland. Created in 1875 after much consultation with Cossack officials, the zemstvos of the Don Host Oblast were dissolved after six years of operation. By 1913 there were zemstvos in 43 governorates.

From 1902 to 1905, there were widespread reports of a total loss of independence on the part of the peasant members of the zemstvos, with authority being ceded to the land captains. During this time, local government was more closely connected to the central bureaucracy, such as the governors&#x27; offices, the ministers of finance, and the ministers of interior. The special police became more and more involved in zemstvo affairs. This was unpopular with zemstvo officials, many of whom were part of a liberal constitutionalist political movement. Financial and practical burdens, as a result of the Russo-Japanese War, contributed to increased tensions.

Rising distrust between the central bureaucracy and the zemstvos was recognized by the Tsar in his 1903 manifesto on provincial administration. This manifesto supported the reforms led by Minister of Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve. The goal of Plehve&#x27;s reforms was to bring tighter control of the zemstvos through gubernatorial oversight. These reforms faced significant opposition from the zemstvos, the ministers of finance, and several governors. In Saint Petersburg, Plehve was able to force the governor, who opposed the reforms, to resign. Plehve worked closely with the Police Department of Russia, which he formerly led, to oust many zemstvo members. Several prominent zemstvo figures, including Shipov, were formally reprimanded by the Tsar.

Following the Russian Peasants&#x27; uprising of 1905–1906, the zemstvos turned sharply conservative. Georgy Lvov was voted off a zemstvo for being a &quot;dangerous liberal&quot;. The zemstvo assemblies, still dominated by nobility, were frightened by the violence of 1905. Many members joined the United Nobility, and the zemstvos became more focused on protecting the interests of the nobility than addressing the grievances of 1905.

The zemstvos were originally given considerable power to impose taxation and to oversee education, medical relief, public welfare, food supply, and road maintenance in their localities. Initially, radicals, such as the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the nihilists, were hostile, believing that the reforms were too minor. Still, in his 1901 article &quot;What is to be done&quot;, Lenin advocated for a short-term alliance with the zemstvos against Tsarist oppression.

As Prime Minister, Pyotr Stolypin gave zemstvos the budget and authority needed to carry out many of the projects under his agrarian reforms. His administration expanded the number of the zemstvos from 34 to 43. A new electoral law resulted in 30% of the legislators of the third and fourth Duma coming from the zemstvos. In the period leading up the 1905 Revolution, and throughout Stolypin&#x27;s governance, the style of debate among zemstvo gentry changed; what began as consensus building and doing favors for friends and family turned into partisan parliamentary politics more typical of 20th century governance.

The All-Russian Zemstvo Union was set up in August 1914 to provide a common voice for all the zemstvos. It was a liberal organisation, which after 1915 operated in conjunction with the Union of Cities.

During the Russian Revolution, the zemstvos lost all authority and the only real authority remaining in Russia rested with the soviets. The zemstvo elections were boycotted because the people considered the soviets as the authority. Many of the third element, the administrators, stopped showing up to their zemstvo-appointed positions and worked for the soviets instead. After the October Revolution, the uniform system of zemstvos was dissolved. In some places, such as Ukraine, the institution remained and took on more nationalist forms.

== Jurisdiction ==
Zemstvos were originally restricted from making rules that were binding on every citizen within their jurisdiction. In 1873, zemstvos were permitted to make regulations binding on every citizen only for the purpose of preventing fires. These powers were expanded in 1879 to allow regulations to prevent the spread of epidemics and zoological diseases.

As time went on, additional gubernatorial oversight was imposed on the zemstvos. In 1867, the zemstvos were prevented from publishing minutes or debates unless given specific permission by the governor. In 1879, the governors were given the power to dismiss, at their discretion, any zemstvo employee. The greatest single change in the zemstvos&#x27; powers came under Alexander III&#x27;s law of . The 1890 law instituted the Bureau of Zemstvo Affairs as additional oversight. Bureau officials were appointed by the emperor, and from local government officials such as Marshall of the Nobility, district prosecutor, and district courts. The bureau overturned 116 zemstvo enactments from 1891 to 1892, with 51 of these enactments being from the Vladimir Provincial Assembly alone.

The 1890 reforms also gave zemstvos the power to issue regulations on a wide variety of issues that were binding on all citizens outside of townships. In return, citizens gained the right to appeal the zemstvo&#x27;s enactments to the Senate. In the 15 years that followed, the Senate heard 226 of these appeals, which primarily involved tax disputes. The reforms changed the legal status of men serving on the zemstvo, from that of private citizen to government official. Zemstvo officials could enforce these regulations by bringing violators before criminal courts. Prior to 1890, zemstvo sessions were often cut short due to assemblies&#x27; not having a quorum. This was in part because officials were not allowed to receive a salary or other compensation.

From 1897 to 1899, the issue of eliminating the district zemstvos and centralizing all functionality within the provincial zemstvo was seriously debated. This debate was especially significant in Moscow where Dmitry Shipov, chairman of the provincial zemstvo, resigned in protest to bring attention to the debate.

In 1902, zemstvo leaders petitioned Nicholas II for the zemstvo to be able to appeal to him, which the emperor refused. The Minister of Interior expressly forbade zemstvo officials from Tver from contacting other provinces on any issue of national politics.

== Zemstvo assembly ==
The main body of the zemtsvo was the assembly, whose members were elected. The assembly generally met once a year to address its docket and to appoint deputies to carry out orders given in response to issues the zemstvo had considered.

Alexander II&#x27;s 1864 decree established 33 provincial zemstvos corresponding to existing governorships. Each provincial governorship was divided into several districts with each district having its own district zemstvo. The law creating the zemstvos outlined 14 objectives for each zemstvo to accomplish.
# Management of zemstvo property and revenue 
# Maintenance of zemstvo property 
# Public food security 
# Management of philanthropy, public welfare, and maintenance of church buildings 
# Mutual property insurance 
# Oversight of the development of trade and industry 
# Economic oversight of public education, public health, and prison systems 
# Facilitating cooperation in preventing of bovine disease and crop plagues 
# Fulfillment of civil, military, and postal demands 
# Distribution of state tax funds disbursed to the zemstvo 
# Setting, collecting, and allocating local taxes 
# Notifying the public of local welfare opportunities and civil rights 
# Hold elections
# Special charters
=== Elections ===
The zemtsvo consisted of a representative council (&quot;zemskoye sobranye&quot;) and an executive board (&quot;zemskaya uprava&quot;) nominated by the former. The members of the board consisted of five groups:
* large landed proprietors (nobles owning at least ), who sat in person
* proxies of the small landowners, including the clergy in their capacity as landed proprietors
* proxies of the wealthier townsmen
* proxies of the less wealthy urban classes
* proxies of the peasants, elected by the volosts

The nobles had more weight in voting even though they constituted a tiny minority of the population. District zemstvos were required to have 40% of their assembly elected by the peasants, but provincial assemblies were elected from the district without such a quota. This resulted in much lower peasant representation at the provincial level.

Alexander III&#x27;s 1890 reforms expanded the nobility&#x27;s representation in the zemstvos, from 55% in 1886 to 72% by 1903. Some historians represent the inequality in terms of the amount of land one member of the zemstvo represented. In 1877, each peasant assembly member represented 1.76 times the land a noble member represented. By 1905, each peasant assembly member represented 6.47 times the land a noble member represented.

Persons under 25 years of age, under criminal investigation, convicted criminals, and foreigners were not permitted to be in a zemstvo. Women who owned sufficient property to gain a seat on a zemstvo could appoint a male proxy to vote for them. By 1913, 20-40% of the eligible voters in Tula Oblast were women. Women were de facto denied the right to serve as deputies with this being confirmed de jure in 1903.

Prior to each election, lists of eligible voters for a given zemstvo were published for public comment. Voters could be stricken by the zemstvo or added to the roster, based on public comment. Voters had to be present to vote in person for candidates who were self-nominated. The electoral bodies were not allowed to give instructions on how candidates should act once elected. The governor could object to the proceedings and suspend electoral decisions. Election reform in 1890 resulted in separate electoral bodies for the noble and common voters. At this time, the clergy, Jews, and non-landowning peasants were deprived of the right to vote in zemstvo elections. Part of the motivation for the election reform was a decline in land ownership by the nobles, which resulted in too few nobles to fill the assembly and deputy roles. These election reforms decreased the size of assemblies and number of deputies by 20-30%.

In 1906, each zemstvo was able to elect one deputy to represent them in the State Council. Absenteeism increased dramatically during this period and many zemstvos were considered to be well attended if half their members showed up to meetings. The rules governing elections to the zemstvos were taken as a model for the electoral law of 1906.

=== Procedure ===
Zemstvo assemblies met at least once a year for not more than twenty days. Extraordinary meetings of a zemstvo required permission from the Minister of the Interior and such meetings could only consider the issues specified by the Minister. Provincial meetings were opened and closed by the local governor, while the district meetings were opened and closed by the local Marshal of the Nobility. These zemstvos typically created a small number of delegations for handling the assembly&#x27;s decisions. One such delegation was an executive board that worked all year. It was not uncommon for one individual to serve as the Marshal of the Nobility and chairman of the executive board for a number of years.

Enactments of the zemstvos generally needed approval from the governor or Minister of the Interior. These approvals could be withheld on the grounds that an enactment was either illegal or against state interests. In the case that enactments were not approved, governors were expected to notify the assembly and suggest modifications to the enactment that would allow it to pass. If compromise could not be found, the Senate would hear the case. The governor was expected to act as a plaintiff and prove that the zemstvo&#x27;s enactment was unjust. The governor could, after an enactment had taken effect, revoke their approval. After 1890, with expanded oversight powers, the Ministry of Interior began to consistently obstruct the work of provincial zemstvos.

== Officials ==
From 1864 to 1889, zemstvos elected the justices of the peace. Following this period the position of &quot;zemskii nachalnik&quot; (zemstvo chief) was created. The &quot;zemskii nachalnik&quot; was appointed by the local nobility, but the zemstvo was required to pay his salary. This was unpopular with the zemstvo. The assembly tried to lower the salary, which became the subject of several lawsuits in the Senate. From 1866 to 1905, zemstvo officials were largely prevented from making contracts with each other on the ground that zemstvos were local organizations. Occasional exemptions were made for fire reinsurance contracts or large agricultural machinery sales.

== Third element ==
The zemstvo executive boards were involved in administering the staff working for the zemstvo. These staff were professional experts from the intelligentsia, known as the &quot;third element&quot;. Aside from the medical and educational staff, the agronomists and statisticians were common third-element professionals. These professionals profited from the employment, but they also donated their time. The third element was a source of the central government&#x27;s distrust of the zemstvos. Unlike the zemstvo administrators (first element) and deputies (second element), the third element often came from the peasant class. For this, they were suspected of being liberal radicals (as some were), which resulted in their persecution by the police.

The term &quot;third element&quot; was coined by Vice-governor Vladimir Kondoidi in 1900, to refer to radical zemstvo employees in Samara. He charged that the third element had largely taken control of the actual operations of the zemstvo.

The governor of Samara subsequently led an investigation that discovered that over half of the zemstvo employees had never had never had their applications submitted to the governor for approval, as required by law.

== Taxation ==
The 10th objective, distribution of state funds assigned to them, was one of the zemstvos&#x27; main functions. About 20% of Russia&#x27;s annual state revenue was assigned to the zemstvos in the early years. Zemstvos received tax revenue from a variety of other sources and for a variety of purposes. It is difficult to summarize a typical zemstvo&#x27;s taxation policy. For example, land tax accounted for between 3 and 90 percent of a zemstvo&#x27;s revenue, depending on the zemstvo and the year. In many districts, police were to collect harvest taxes on behalf of the zemstvo. However, there was significant difficulty in actually collecting such taxes because the zemstvo had no control over the police, and the assemblies were forbidden from rewarding the police, including even thanking them. In 1866, the Senate ruled that zemstvos were not allowed to tax industrial output.

In the beginning of the zemstvo system, natural obligations, such as an obligation to do road work and in-kind taxes such as in wheat, were of greater concern to the peasants than monetary taxation. These taxes accounted for a large part of the zemstvo&#x27;s resources but were unpopular. Over time, these were mostly converted into monetary taxes. This policy was also not popular, as the zemstvos were often seen by contemporary peasants as worthless institutions that raised a lot of taxes.

Zemstvo expenditure grew from 89.1 million rubles in 1900 to 290.5 million rubles in 1913. Of the latter sum, 90.1 million rubles were spent on education, 71.4 million on medical assistance, 22.2 million on improvements to agriculture, and 8 million on veterinary measures. The chief sources of zemstvo revenue were taxes on lands, forests, country dwellings, factories, mines, and other real estate.

The participants of the Russian Revolution of 1905 were largely zemstvo participants as well. In 1905–6, 66 districts boycotted paying taxes they thought too high. Discontent was most severe where the zemstvo&#x27;s tax on land allotted to the peasants was taxed much higher than privately owned land. Notable participants in the 1905 revolution affiliated with the zemstvos include Dmitry Shipov, Dmitry Shakhovskoy, Georgy Lvov, Pavel Dolgorukov, and Fedor Redichev. Several of these men were also members of Beseda: a clandestine organization for liberals to discuss the issues of the zemstvo.

In 1917 rural societies in Stavropol refused to pay taxes and boycotted schools, medical centers, and all other services after the zemstvo was first introduced there. Rising tensions resulted in three protesters being killed by the police and with the zemstvo remaining in power. The governor reported:

The dissatisfaction of the rural population with the introduction of the zemstvo was evident almost everywhere in the province shortly after the distribution of the tax lists. The peasants, being insufficiently informed about the taxes and the sphere of activity of zemtsvo institutions which were only in their first year of existence, noticed the exceptional increase in local taxes.

== Education ==
Literacy rose from 10% to 68% during the existence of the zemstvo system. The zemstvo educational system was built on the existing peasant and clerical educational systems. From 1907 to 1917, the Ministry of Education exerted increasing control over education.

Beginning in 1886 and continuing throughout the existence of the zemstvos, the central bureaucracy sought additional control over primary education. This started with special school inspections that could result in the closing of unsatisfactory schools. The Marshall of Nobility was given special privileges—such as conducting school inspections, having sole authority to open new schools, and chairing school boards—by the 1874 primary school legislation, but these privileges did not have a large effect on schools, because most zemstvos never ceded financial control over the schools to the school boards and many of the supposed inspections simply never occurred. Peasants mostly supported zemstvo schools, over existing schools created by the crown or clergy. The number of synod-administrated schools fell from 24,000 in 1886 to 4,000 by 1880.

The zemstvo school system was built upon the existing peasant educational system. Prior to 1870, peasant communities were required to provide educational facilities, and the zemstvos did not reliably pay teachers. In the 1870s, zemstvos shifted to providing reliable salaries and additional materials, such as blackboards. The shift from these schools being funded by the peasant communities to being included in zemstvo budgets took several decades. The zemstvos did not reach budget parity with the local peasant communities until 1889. Afterwards, zemstvo budgets rapidly expanded, and education became the largest share of those budgets. In 1893, the total zemstvo expenditure on education was 9 million rubles; in 1913, it was nearly 90 million rubles.
Students of zemstvo schools could be subjected to year-end examinations at the zemstvo&#x27;s discretion. Pass rates for these exams were used to evaluate teacher performance, and less military service was required of male students who passed.

Zemstvo teachers came mostly from the middle class. There was a mix of male and female teachers, with a tendency to have more females. Teachers were united by low pay, isolation in communities unfamiliar to them, and being unmarried. There were 17% female, and 47% male, married teachers in 1911.

The first formal curriculum for zemstvo schooling was created by the Ministry of Education in 1897. This program prescribed a weekly six hours&#x27; study of the Word of God, three hours of Slavonic Church, eight hours of Russian language, two hours of writing, and five hours of arithmetic. Choir was a popular way to boost scholastic engagement. Nearly every other form of education received criticism, but teaching students to read the lyrics and memorize the tones of church songs was encouraged by all.

In 1907, the Duma created a fund to establish a school in every village in Russia. These funds were disbursed through the zemstvos to existing schools, or were given to school curators, which often resulted in the construction of new schools. Under the school curators arose a new class of &quot;state schools&quot; which were not affiliated with the zemstvos. In 1910, the Ministry of Education created a national pension fund that all teachers could participate in. Additional administrative action in 1913 caused the existing zemstvo schools to come more under the influence of the Ministry of Education than the zemstvos themselves. In 1914, zemstvos lost the power to direct school teachers and the ministry gained the power to fire any school teachers they deemed as unfit.

== Medicine ==
Prior to the zemstvo medical system, Russian peasants mostly relied on faith healers, who specialized in magical chants and folk remedies, for their medical care. The zemstvos viewed providing increased support for medical systems as their most important task. Therefore, the zemstvo medical system became as much a popular movement for supporting an ideal as an actual service. To accomplish this, the zemstvos promoted policies that limited the direct costs to peasants of their medical care and aimed to compensate providers through tax funds. The medical experts supported by the zemstvos focused on education in hygiene and preventive medicine. The zemstvo officials and practitioners appreciated the difficulty of not only of making illiterate, god-fearing peasants trust a largely secular medical system based on rational analysis, but of making them understand that distinction at all.

The growth of the medical system was slow and depended on the growth of the third element. The first zemstvo bureaucracies for managing the various salaried positions connected with the zemstvo did not emerge until the 1870s. Growing numbers of salaried workers inevitably led to growing budgets. At several points in the early zemstvo period, budget concerns led to the laying off of practitioners. By 1910, nearly all districts had a physician-patient ratio worse than 1 to 10,000.

Practitioners suffered from a lack of trust on the zemstvos&#x27; part. Recommendations such as funding for hospital improvements would be weighed against ideas from the assembly itself. Practitioners made several attempts to form a national organization for the advancement of medicine, but its implementation was delayed until 1885. One of the goals this national system would achieve was uniform medical records to facilitate analyzing cases from other provinces. Practitioners also demanded changing from the circuit system, where they spent most of the their time traveling to each remote village to see patients, to a stationary system, where practitioners held regular hours at a medical center. Zemstvos opposed the stationary system throughout the 1870s on the grounds that remote villagers, who paid taxes towards the medical service, would not receive equal access. In the 1880s, the stationary system became more popular as the number of practitioners grew.

As the circuit system faded away, the zemstvos engaged in heated debates over what to do with the feldshers, who filled the gap between the ideal medical care the zemstvo system sought and the practical limitations of what could be provided. Restrictions were placed on feldshers, such that much of their day-to-day job became technically illegal, but there was no one else to provide medical care. This was widely known and tolerated by all, but the increasing criminalization of the feldsher&#x27;s work symbolized what the zemstvo medical system still needed to achieve. One reason for the zemstvos&#x27; opposition was that feldshers blurred the lines between the traditional spiritual medicine and modern medicine. Rather than fading away, the feldsher practice was opened to women in 1871 to meet growing demands. Alongside growing numbers of feldshers was an increasing professionalism on their part through more formal training as physician assistants.

Sanitary councils began meeting in the 1870s, but were not effective until after 1879 when zemstvos gained the power to issue sanitary legislation binding on all citizens. Moscow was a particular leader in the development of sanitary councils and then a full-time bureau of sanitation professionals.

Midwifery was a contemporaneously known issue during the zemstvo period because nearly one-in-two peasant children did not reach adulthood. This is a notable area in which the zemstvos failed. At the peak of midwifery during the zemstvo system, only 2% of births were attended. The primary cause of this failure was peasant women did not want strangers involved in their deliveries.

<doc id="399668" wikidata="Q5584641" url="?curid=399668" title="Gord the Rogue">
<text>Gord the Rogue is the protagonist in a series of fantasy novels and short stories written by Gary Gygax. Gygax originally wrote the novels and short stories to promote his &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. After he left TSR, Gygax continued to write &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; novels for several years. In all of these works, the plot revolves around the adventures of a young man named Gord who rises from humble origins in the slums of a large city on the planet Oerth to become a powerful force trying to stave off the takeover of Oerth by demons.

==Publication history==
One of the factors that contributed to the success of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting when it was published in 1984 was a popular series of concurrent novels by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Gary Gygax, the developer of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, realized that novels set in Greyhawk could have a similar benefit for his recently published &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set, so he wrote &quot;Saga of Old City&quot;, the first in a series of novels that would be published under the banner &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot;. The protagonist was Gord the Rogue, and this first novel told of his rise from the Slum Quarter of the city of Greyhawk to become world traveller and thief extraordinaire. The novel was designed to promote sales of the boxed set by providing colourful details about the social customs and peoples of various cities and countries in a region called the Flanaess.

Shannon Appelcline noted that &quot;Gygax introduced Gord in &quot;Dragon #100&quot; (August 1985) in a story called “At Moonset Blackcat Comes.” The first novel, &quot;Saga of Old City&quot; (1985) appeared a couple of months later.&quot; Appelcline also noted that as TSR published the last projects that Gygax started, &quot;A few more Greyhawk books appeared as well. The first of those was &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot; (1986), Gygax&#x27;s second and final Gord the Rogue novel for TSR.&quot; Appelcline commented that &quot;After Gygax left TSR in 1985, the Greyhawk setting &quot;forked&quot;. Gygax himself retained rights to his fictional character, Gord the Rogue — as well as a few characters whose names derived from his, such as Zagyg the Mad Wizard. Over the next several years, Gygax used those rights to publish a series of Gord the Rogue novels ending with &quot;Dance of Demons&quot; (1988) in which Gygax destroyed Oerth (!) and replaced it with the world of Yarth — which may or may not have been the Aerth of &quot;Mythus&quot; (1992).&quot;

Appelcline explained that since Gygax retained his rights to Gord when he started New Infinites, &quot;Now, he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new books. The first was &quot;Sea of Death&quot; (1987), and it quickly hit bestseller lists. Over the next years, the success of the Gord novels would continue, and they would be the main thing keeping New Infinities in business. As a result, Gygax would spend most of his time at New Infinities working on books rather than RPGs.&quot; Appelcline noted that &quot;Gygax&#x27;s Gord the Rogue appeared a few times after New Infinities disappeared, once in White Wolf &#x27;s &quot;Pawn of Chaos: Tales of the Eternal Champion&quot; (1996) and once in Paizo Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Magazine #344&quot; (2006). Some of his stories were also reprinted by Troll Lord Games and Paizo Publishing.&quot; Appelcline also noted that in 2006 &quot;Troll Lord Games revealed that they had licensed Gygax&#x27;s Gord the Rogue novels, previously published by TSR and New Infinities Productions. The first, &quot;Tale of Old City&quot; (2008), would unfortunately be one of Troll Lord&#x27;s final Gygax publications.&quot;

Even before &quot;Saga of Old City&quot; rolled off the presses in November 1985, Gygax wrote a sequel, &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot;. He also wrote a short story, &quot;At Moonset Blackcat Comes&quot;, that appeared in the special 100th issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine in August 1985. This introduced Gord the Rogue to gamers just before &quot;Saga of Old City&quot; was scheduled to be released.

However, at the same time, various factions within TSR with different visions of the company&#x27;s future caused a power struggle, and Gygax was forced out on December 31, 1985. By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all D&amp;D characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).

After Gygax left TSR in 1985, he continued to write a few more &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; novels, which were published by New Infinities Productions: &quot;Sea of Death&quot; (1987), &quot;Night Arrant&quot; (1987), &quot;City of Hawks&quot; (1987), &quot;Come Endless Darkness&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dance of Demons&quot; (1988). In Gygax&#x27;s absence, however, TSR moved the Greyhawk storyline in new directions that Gygax didn&#x27;t appreciate, and the line of &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; novels (without Gord the Rogue) continued to be written by Rose Estes. In a literary declaration that his old world of Oerth was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk and D&amp;D, Gygax destroyed his version of Oerth in the final Gord the Rogue novel, &quot;Dance of Demons&quot;.

==Series overview==
The series of novels follows the progress of the orphan beggar Gord, from his lowly youth to his ascension as an avatar of Balance. Gord begins his career with less than heroic motives, but early mentors Gellor the bard and druid Curley Greenleaf continually steer him toward honorable ends. Eventually Gord is revealed to have a kinship with an enigmatic deity named the Catlord.

The series, originally designed to provide some social and descriptive details about Gygax&#x27;s Greyhawk campaign world that he had not been able to fit into the limited space of either the 1980 folio edition or the 1983 boxed set, were written in a pulp swords and sorcery style reminiscent of Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot; short stories. Gygax, who believed D&amp;D would always only appeal to a male demographic, wrote the novels for that readership.

===Individual novels===
&quot;Saga of Old City&quot; was the first novel in TSR&#x27;s &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; series. It starts in Gord&#x27;s childhood, and ends with his triumphant return to Greyhawk City as a young man and master thief. He learns his trade in the &quot;beggars&#x27; guild&quot;, and gets involved in the gang war touched off by the beggars encroaching on the official thieves&#x27; guild&#x27;s territory. He travels and has a variety of swashbuckling adventures, ranging from participating in a war to liberating a young noblewoman held hostage.

&quot;Artifact of Evil&quot; is a continuation of &quot;Saga of Old City&quot;. This was the final novel under TSR&#x27;s &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; banner that was written by Gygax. An ancient artifact is uncovered, whose power could destroy their world. It is up to Gord and his companions to try to stop this artifact of evil from falling into the wrong hands.

&quot;Sea of Death&quot;, the first of the series published by New Infinities Productions, Inc., has Gord traveling far afield to the Sea of Dust, on a quest for a &quot;Theorpart&quot;, hidden in a lost city. He must face rivals sent by demon lords: the psychopathic dwarf Obmi, who serves Zuggtmoy, and the drow priestess Eclavdra, serving Graz&#x27;zt. He meets and falls in love with Leda, a clone of Eclavdra. Leda and Gord part at the end of the book as she returns to the Abyss, impersonating Eclavdra in Graz&#x27;zt&#x27;s service for the sake of higher ideals.

&quot;Night Arrant&quot; is a collection of nine short stories about Gord&#x27;s adventures, in his early twenties, in the City of Greyhawk.

&quot;City of Hawks&quot; is a retelling of the events that occurred in &quot;Saga of Old City&quot;. Gord&#x27;s rise from simple beggar to master thief are detailed, as is his search for his true heritage.

&quot;Come Endless Darkness&quot; continues where &quot;Sea of Death&quot; left off and has Gord continue his quest to stop Tharizdun and Lord Entropy from taking over the Multiverse.

&quot;Dance of Demons&quot; is the finale, in which Gord and Gellor enter the Abyss on a mission from the world&#x27;s most powerful forces of Balance, to retrieve the remaining Theorparts. The goal is nothing less than to free Tharizdun, the long-imprisoned god of ultimate evil and entropy, and to finally destroy him. The novel ends with the complete destruction of Oerth, and the unveiling of a new and better world.

===Uncollected short stories===
&quot;At Moonset Blackcat Comes&quot; is an early tale of Gord and his friend Chert the barbarian, in which Gord accepts a mission for the Catlord.

&quot;Evening Odds&quot; appears as story 14 in &quot;Pawn of Chaos: Tales of the Eternal Champion&quot;, an anthology of fiction inspired by Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Eternal Champion mythos. The story takes place some time after the events of &quot;Dance of Demons.&quot; Gord has apparently been deposed from his position as the new Catlord and is traveling the alternate realities as a Champion of Balance. In the course of the story he upsets a plot by the archfiend Baphomet on modern Earth.

&quot;The Return of Gord&quot; is a caper story set during Gord&#x27;s days as a master thief in the City of Greyhawk, and &quot;A Wizard&#x27;s Thief&quot; is another caper story, involving Gord and Chert, and set in an unnamed city.

Dave Langford, reviewing &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot; in the April 1986 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 78), was critical of Gygax&#x27;s writing ability, saying, &quot;At the first glimpse within, my soul was purged by the brutalities visited upon the English language.&quot; Langford believed the book was simply &quot;an &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; campaign write-up&quot; rather than a bona-fide fantasy novel.

==Description==
Gord is described as being small for a human, five and a half feet tall, slender and wiry. His eyes are iron-gray in color. He has black hair and olive-toned skin (which allows him to fit in among the Rhennee).

==Reception==
In a 2021 &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken described Gord as &quot;a young street urchin who rises from poverty and imprisonment to become one of the greatest thieves on the planet&quot; and goes on to say that &quot;Gygax also revels in the misery he can inflict upon Gord&quot;. He described Gord&#x27;s adventures as &quot;a series of ho-hum &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game sessions&quot; with &quot;no overarching plot&quot; or and &quot;no emotional growth&quot;. Bricken felt that the novel and its plot were &quot;all terrible, but it might be mitigated if Gord weren&#x27;t so &quot;deeply&quot; unlikeable&quot;. Bricken commented after reading &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot; that &quot;even in this mortal realm, where I&#x27;ve devoted my life to watching bad movies and reading bad books, reading more about Gord feels like a zero-sum game to me&quot;.
