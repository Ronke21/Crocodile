<text>Helen Dale (born Helen Darville; 1972) is an Australian writer and lawyer. She is best known for writing &quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper&quot;, a novel about a Ukrainian family who collaborated with the Nazis in The Holocaust, under the pseudonym Helen Demidenko.

A daughter of British immigrants, Dale was educated at Redeemer Lutheran College in Rochedale, a suburb of Brisbane. While studying English literature at the University of Queensland, she wrote &quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper&quot;. In 1993, the novel won The Australian/Vogel Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript.

Dale published her book in 1994 and won the Miles Franklin Award, becoming the award&#x27;s youngest winner. The following year, she was the subject of a major Australian literary controversy because she had falsely claimed Ukrainian ancestry as part of the basis of the book (and her pseudonym). The misrepresentation has been described as a &quot;literary hoax&quot; in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald.&quot; The novel was subsequently reissued under her legal name, then Helen Darville. It won the 1995 Australian Literature Society Gold Medal.

After teaching, Dale returned to university, gaining her law degree in 2002. She later did post-graduate law study at Oxford and completed an LLB degree in 2012 at the University of Edinburgh. She returned to Australia and became a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate, but at the end of May 2016 Leyonhjelm revealed that Dale had left his employ.

==Early life==
A daughter of British immigrants, Dale was educated at Redeemer Lutheran College in Rochedale, a suburb of Brisbane. She had previously claimed that her father was Ukrainian, and her mother was Irish.

==&quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper&quot;: Novel and controversy==
While studying English literature at the University of Queensland, she wrote &quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper,&quot; a novel about a Ukrainian family who collaborated with the Nazis in The Holocaust. In 1993, the novel won The Australian Vogel Literary Award for an unpublished manuscript.

===Contents===
The novel tells the story of a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of Stalinist purges and state-imposed poverty and famine. The family comprises the parents, a daughter, and two sons. They suffer abuse by the drunken local commissar and are refused treatment by the village doctor and his wife (a secular Jew). Many Ukrainians hail the German invaders as liberators from Soviet oppression. Many volunteered for the German armed forces—Wehrmacht, SS, and Ordnungspolizei. The novel stresses the arbitrariness of the assignments to military units. A Ukrainian could as easily end up fighting on the front alongside the Wehrmacht as be in a death squad.

The two young brothers are separated in military assignments: 16-year-old Evheny to Nazi Einsatzgruppen C (a mobile killing squad) and the elder 19-year-old Vitaly to the SS training facility for Ukrainians at Trawniki in Poland. Evheny is implicated in the massacre at Babi Yar outside Kiev, while Vitaly is posted to Treblinka extermination camp as a guard. Evheny is later sent to a front-line Waffen SS formation on the Eastern Front, while Vitaly is posted to northern Italy. He is part of German anti-partisan activity in the wake of Italy&#x27;s withdrawal from the Axis alliance.

===Style===
The novel is told primarily from the point of view of Kateryna, sister of the two brothers, and Magda, Vitaly&#x27;s common-law wife from the Polish village near the Treblinka extermination camp. Kateryna has a relationship with a German SS Hauptsturmführer. Magda assists a Jewish prisoner to escape after the Treblinka prisoner revolt in August 1943. The family&#x27;s story is gradually revealed by Fiona, Evheny&#x27;s Australian-born daughter, who starts investigating the past after her uncle Vitaly is charged in the early 1990s with war crimes in World War II.

The book is frank about the antisemitism of its major characters (who blame Jews for the excesses of Communism), and Dale represented the lives of Ukrainian military men in a sympathetic manner, rather than featuring their victims as is more usual in Holocaust literature. These elements attracted accusations of antisemitism and condemnation of the book by leaders of Australia&#x27;s Jewish community. There was a perception that the attitudes of the author &quot;Helen Demidenko&quot; may have been informed by her Ukrainian ethnic identity, until her pseudonym was revealed along with her false representation of the book as history.

===Controversy===
&quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper&quot; won the Miles Franklin Award, one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia. At the time, the media discovered Helen Dale&#x27;s identity and legal name. This promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature.

Despite the adverse publicity for the author, the novel won the 1995 Australian Literature Society Gold Medal.

When Dale submitted her novel to the University of Queensland Press in 1993, she said it was based upon recorded interviews with her own relatives, among others her uncle &quot;Vitaly Demidenko&quot;. After the awards, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; mistakenly reported in 2005 that the novel had been submitted as a non-fiction book. The author&#x27;s 1993 note accompanying her manuscript had read: &quot;The things narrated in this book really happened, the things they did [are] historical actualities.&quot; Then Dale wrote that she was presenting her book as fiction, saying: &quot;But this is also a work of fiction. I have presented it as fiction...&quot;

===Books that discuss the scandal===
The controversy that surrounded &quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper&quot; inspired the publication in 1996 of two books that assessed the novel and issues of authenticity: Robert Manne&#x27;s &quot;The Culture of Forgetting: Helen Demidenko and the Holocaust&quot; and Andrew Riemer&#x27;s &quot;The Demidenko Debate&quot;. Manne is very critical of Dale&#x27;s book. Riemer is not, believing her approach was consistent with fiction, even if she tried to exaggerate the specific historic basis of her work.

==Later work and recent years==
In 1995, Dale published a short story, &quot;Pieces of the Puzzle&quot;, in the Australian culture journal &quot;Meanjin&quot;. The byline was &#x27;Demidenko&#x27;, although the journal noted that the author had &quot;taken back&quot; her legal name of Darville. She has said that she had met Ukrainian witnesses to the war and the Holocaust, and based the story on their accounts. The Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote to her demanding that she identify these possible war criminals.

Dale was briefly a columnist with the Brisbane daily newspaper &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;. She was dismissed for accusations of plagiarism after repeating jokes originally from the &#x27;Evil Overlord List&#x27; in one of her columns and passing them off as her own. She continued to write freelance features for other News Corporation newspapers and magazines, and occasionally the Fairfax press. In 2017, an investigation by BuzzFeed revealed that Dale had also plagiarised a number of social media posts in her Twitter and Facebook feeds. BuzzFeed asked Dale why she had been lifting the tweets. She replied over Twitter direct message: &quot;Cos it&#x27;s amusing and I don&#x27;t like Twitter. And don&#x27;t you have more important stuff to be writing about?&quot;

In 2000, Dale was again accused of antisemitism after interviewing David Irving, a Holocaust denier, for &quot;Australian Style&quot; magazine during his libel trial in London. (It was decided against him). She wrote a post-11 September article in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

After working as a secondary teacher for several years in Australia and the UK, Dale returned to the University of Queensland in 2002 to study law. Graduating with a first class honours degree in law in 2005,she commenced work as a judge&#x27;s associate for Peter Dutney, a justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland.

Previously a regular contributor to the libertarian group blog Catallaxy files under the name &#x27;skepticlawyer&#x27;, Dale now has her own blog in this name.

Since gaining her law degree, Dale has also appeared on the SBS program &quot;Insight&quot;, and as a guest of the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Publishing and Communications Program. She is associated with the Australian Skeptics, and has written for both their in-house magazine and &quot;Quadrant,&quot; a conservative journal. In 2007 Dale was reported to be working on a second novel.

Dale completed the Bachelor of Civil Law programme at the University of Oxford, where she was a member of Brasenose College. In 2008 she started reading for an MPhil in Law (Jurisprudence). She completed a Graduate LLB degree at the University of Edinburgh School of Law in 2012. During that time she won the Law Society of Scotland&#x27;s student essay competition. The topic of her prize-winning essay was same-sex marriage. Dale completed a post-graduate qualification before beginning work in 2013 as a trainee solicitor with the law firm MBM Commercial.

Dale is reported to have worked variously as a graphic designer, property law lecturer, and physical education teacher.

In 2014, Dale returned to Australia, becoming a senior adviser to David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat member of the Australian Senate. She resigned during the election campaign in 2016.

Her most recent work is a two-part novel titled &quot;Kingdom of the Wicked&quot;. The first book, &quot;Rules&quot;, came out in 2017 and the second, &quot;Order&quot;, in 2018. It is a reimagining of the trial of Jesus Christ at the hands of Pontius Pilate in a technologically sophisticated Roman Empire.

<doc id="399675" wikidata="Q1343020" url="?curid=399675" title="Reboot (fiction)">
<text>In serial fiction, the term &quot;reboot&quot; signifies a new start to an established fictional universe, work, or series. A reboot usually discards continuity to re-create its characters, plotlines and backstory from the beginning. It has been described as a way to &quot;rebrand&quot; or &quot;restart an entertainment universe that has already been established&quot;.

Another definition of a reboot is a remake which is part of an established film series or other media franchise. The term has been criticized for being a vague and &quot;confusing&quot; &quot;buzzword&quot;, and a neologism for remake, a concept which has been losing popularity since the 2010s. William Proctor proposes that there is a distinction between reboots, remakes and retcons.

==Origin==
The term is thought to originate from the computing term &quot;reboot&quot;, meaning to restart a computer system. There is a change in meaning: the computing term refers to restarting the same program unaltered, while the term discussed here refers to revising a narrative from the beginning. The first known use of reboot applied to an entertainment franchise was in a 1994 Usenet posting.

==Types==
Reboots cut out non-essential elements associated with a pre-established franchise and start it anew, distilling it down to the core elements that made the source material popular. For audiences, reboots allow easier entry for newcomers unfamiliar with earlier titles in a series.

===Comic books===
In comic books, a long-running title may have its continuity erased to start over from the beginning, enabling writers to redefine characters and open up new story opportunities, allowing the title to bring in new readers. Comic books sometimes use an in-universe explanation for a reboot, such as merging parallel worlds and timelines together, or destroying a fictional universe and recreating it from the beginning.

===Film===
With reboots, filmmakers revamp and reinvigorate a film series to attract new fans and stimulate revenue. A reboot can renew interest in a series that has grown stale. Reboots act as a safe project for a studio, since a reboot with an established fanbase is less risky (in terms of expected profit) than an entirely original work, while at the same time allowing the studio to explore new demographics.

===Television===

A television series can return to production after cancellation or a long hiatus. Whereas a reboot disregards the previous continuity of a work, the term has also been used as a &quot;catch all&quot; phrase to categorize sequel series or general remakes due to the rise of such productions in the late 2010s.

A related concept is retooling, which is used to substantially change the premise of a series while keeping some of the core characters. Retools are usually part of an effort to forestall cancellation of a still running production.

===Video games===
Reboots and remakes are common in the video game industry. Remakes in video games are used to refresh the storyline and elements of the game and to take advantage of technology and features not available at the time of earlier entries.

==Soft reboot==
A soft reboot is a reboot that shares some continuity with the original series, but that changes the style, tone, or intent. It usually serves to allow writers more creative freedom while mostly maintaining the same setting the audience has grown accustomed to.

==The &quot;gritty reboot&quot;==
In the 21st century, the notion of the &quot;gritty reboot&quot; gained popularity, in which various franchises that often had a lighter tone in their original form were remade in a darker and more mature form. Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dark Knight Trilogy&quot; is one of the earlier, more famous, and highly regarded example, and was followed by gritty reboots of DC&#x27;s Justice League, the James Bond franchise with &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 2006, and others including &quot;Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, among many other examples.

<doc id="399678" wikidata="Q726648" url="?curid=399678" title="Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope">
<text>The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST, also FGRST), formerly called the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), is a space observatory being used to perform gamma-ray astronomy observations from low Earth orbit. Its main instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), with which astronomers mostly intend to perform an all-sky survey studying astrophysical and cosmological phenomena such as active galactic nuclei, pulsars, other high-energy sources and dark matter. Another instrument aboard Fermi, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM; formerly GLAST Burst Monitor), is being used to study gamma-ray bursts and solar flares.

Fermi, named for high-energy physics pioneer Enrico Fermi, was launched on 11 June 2008 at 16:05 UTC aboard a Delta II 7920-H rocket. The mission is a joint venture of NASA, the United States Department of Energy, and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden, becoming the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope on orbit, succeeding INTEGRAL. The project is a recognized CERN experiment (RE7).

== Overview ==
Fermi includes two scientific instruments, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).
* The LAT is an imaging gamma-ray detector (a pair-conversion instrument) which detects photons with energy from about 20 million to about 300 billion electronvolts (20 MeV to 300 GeV), with a field of view of about 20% of the sky; it may be thought of as a sequel to the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.
* The GBM consists of 14 scintillation detectors (twelve sodium iodide crystals for the 8 keV to 1 MeV range and two bismuth germanate crystals with sensitivity from 150 keV to 30 MeV), and can detect gamma-ray bursts in that energy range across the whole of the sky not occluded by the Earth.

General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (formerly Spectrum Astro and now Orbital Sciences) in Gilbert, Arizona, designed and built the spacecraft that carries the instruments. It travels in a low, circular orbit with a period of about 95 minutes. Its normal mode of operation maintains its orientation so that the instruments will look away from the Earth, with a &quot;rocking&quot; motion to equalize the coverage of the sky. The view of the instruments will sweep out across most of the sky about 16 times per day. The spacecraft can also maintain an orientation that points to a chosen target.

Both science instruments underwent environmental testing, including vibration, vacuum, and high and low temperatures to ensure that they can withstand the stresses of launch and continue to operate in space. They were integrated with the spacecraft at the General Dynamics ASCENT facility in Gilbert, Arizona.

Data from the instruments are available to the public through the Fermi Science Support Center web site. Software for analyzing the data is also available.

== GLAST renamed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ==

NASA&#x27;s Alan Stern, associate administrator for Science at NASA Headquarters, launched a public competition 7 February 2008, closing 31 March 2008, to rename GLAST in a way that would &quot;capture the excitement of GLAST&#x27;s mission and call attention to gamma-ray and high-energy astronomy ... something memorable to commemorate this spectacular new astronomy mission ... a name that is catchy, easy to say and will help make the satellite and its mission a topic of dinner table and classroom discussion&quot;.

Fermi gained its new name in 2008: On 26 August 2008, GLAST was renamed the &quot;Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope&quot; in honor of Enrico Fermi, a pioneer in high-energy physics.

== Mission ==


NASA designed the mission with a five-year lifetime, with a goal of ten years of operations.

The key scientific objectives of the Fermi mission have been described as:
* To understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration in active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and supernova remnants (SNR).
* Resolve the gamma-ray sky: unidentified sources and diffuse emission.
* Determine the high-energy behavior of gamma-ray bursts and transients.
* Probe dark matter (e.g. by looking for an excess of gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way) and early Universe.
* Search for evaporating primordial micro black holes (MBH) from their presumed gamma burst signatures (Hawking Radiation component).

The National Academies of Sciences ranked this mission as a top priority. Many new possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from this single mission and greatly expand our view of the Universe. 
* Blazars and active galaxies
:Study energy spectra and variability of wavelengths of light coming from blazars so as to determine the composition of the black hole jets aimed directly at Earth -- whether they are
::(a) a combination of electrons and positrons or
::(b) only protons.
* Gamma-ray bursts
:Study gamma-ray bursts with an energy range several times more intense than ever before so that scientists may be able to understand them better.
* Neutron stars
:Study younger, more energetic pulsars in the Milky Way than ever before so as to broaden our understanding of stars. Study the pulsed emissions of magnetospheres so as to possibly solve how they are produced. Study how pulsars generate winds of interstellar particles.
* Milky Way galaxy
:Provide new data to help improve upon existing theoretical models of our own galaxy.
* Gamma-ray background radiation
:Study better than ever before whether ordinary galaxies are responsible for gamma-ray background radiation. The potential for a tremendous discovery awaits if ordinary sources are determined to be irresponsible, in which case the cause may be anything from self-annihilating dark matter to entirely new chain reactions among interstellar particles that have yet to be conceived.
* The early universe
:Study better than ever before how concentrations of visible and ultraviolet light change over time. The mission should easily detect regions of spacetime where gamma-rays interacted with visible or UV light to make matter. This can be seen as an example of E=mc2 working in reverse, where energy is converted into mass, in the early universe.
* Sun
:Study better than ever before how our own Sun produces gamma rays in solar flares.
* Dark matter
:Search for evidence that dark matter is made up of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments already planned for the Large Hadron Collider as well as other underground detectors. The potential for a tremendous discovery in this area is possible over the next several years.
* Fundamental physics
:Test better than ever before certain established theories of physics, such as whether the speed of light in vacuum remains constant regardless of wavelength. Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity contends that it does, yet some models in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity predict that it may not. Search for gamma rays emanating from former black holes that once exploded, providing yet another potential step toward the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Determine whether photons naturally split into smaller photons, as predicted by quantum mechanics and already achieved under controlled, man-made experimental conditions.
* Unknown discoveries
:Scientists estimate a very high possibility for new scientific discoveries, even revolutionary discoveries, emerging from this single mission.

== Mission timeline ==

=== Prelaunch ===
On 4 March 2008, the spacecraft arrived at the Astrotech payload processing facility in Titusville, Florida. On 4 June 2008, after several previous delays, launch status was retargeted for 11 June at the earliest, the last delays resulting from the need to replace the Flight Termination System batteries. The launch window extended from 15:45 to 17:40 UTC daily, until 7 August 2008.

=== Launch ===
Launch occurred successfully on 11 June 2008 at 16:05 UTC aboard a Delta 7920H-10C rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17-B. Spacecraft separation took place about 75 minutes after launch.

=== Orbit ===
Fermi resides in a low-Earth circular orbit at an altitude of , and at an inclination of 28.5 degrees.

=== Software modifications ===
GLAST received some minor modifications to its computer software on 23 June 2008.

=== LAT/GBM computers operational ===
Computers operating both the LAT and GBM and most of the LAT&#x27;s components were turned on 24 June 2008. The LAT high voltage was turned on 25 June, and it began detecting high-energy particles from space, but minor adjustments were still needed to calibrate the instrument. The GBM high voltage was also turned on 25 June, but the GBM still required one more week of testing/calibrations before searching for gamma-ray bursts.

=== Sky survey mode ===
After presenting an overview of the Fermi instrumentation and goals, Jennifer Carson of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory had concluded that the primary goals were &quot;all achievable with the all-sky scanning mode of observing&quot;. Fermi switched to &quot;sky survey mode&quot; on 26 June 2008 so as to begin sweeping its field of view over the entire sky every three hours (every two orbits).

=== Collision avoided ===
On 30 April 2013, NASA revealed that the telescope had narrowly avoided a collision a year earlier with a defunct Cold War-era Soviet spy satellite, Kosmos 1805, in April 2012. Orbital predictions several days earlier indicated that the two satellites were expected to occupy the same point in space within 30 milliseconds of each other. On 3 April, telescope operators decided to stow the satellite&#x27;s high-gain parabolic antenna, rotate the solar panels out of the way and to fire Fermi&#x27;s rocket thrusters for one second to move it out of the way. Even though the thrusters had been idle since the telescope had been placed in orbit nearly five years earlier, they worked correctly and potential disaster was thus avoided.

=== Extended mission 2013–2018 ===
In August 2013 Fermi started its 5-year mission extension.

=== Pass 8 software upgrade ===
In June 2015, the Fermi LAT Collaboration released &quot;Pass 8 LAT data&quot;. Iterations of the analysis framework used by LAT are called &quot;passes&quot; and at launch Fermi LAT data was analyzed using Pass 6. Significant improvements to Pass 6 were included in Pass 7 which debuted in August 2011.

Every detection by the Fermi LAT since its launch, was reexamined with the latest tools to learn how the LAT detector responded to both each event and to the background. This improved understanding led to two major improvements: gamma-rays that had been missed by previous analysis were detected and the direction they arrived from was determined with greater accuracy. The impact of the latter is to sharpen Fermi LAT&#x27;s vision as illustrated in the figure on the right. Pass 8 also delivers better energy measurements and a significantly increased effective area. The entire mission dataset was reprocessed.

These improvements have the greatest impact on both the low and high ends of the range of energy Fermi LAT can detect - in effect expanding the energy range within which LAT can make useful observations. The improvement in the performance of Fermi LAT due to Pass 8 is so dramatic that this software update is sometimes called the cheapest satellite upgrade in history. Among numerous advances, it allowed for a better search for Galactic spectral lines from dark matter interactions, analysis of extended supernova remnants, and to search for extended sources in the Galactic plane.

For almost all event classes, Version P8R2 had a residual background that was not fully isotropic. This anisotropy was traced to cosmic-ray electrons leaking through the ribbons of the Anti-Coincidence Detector and a set of cuts allowed rejection of these events while minimally impacting acceptance. This selection was used to create the P8R3 version of LAT data.

=== Solar array drive failure ===
On 16 March 2018 one of Fermi&#x27;s solar arrays quit rotating, prompting a transition to &quot;safe hold&quot; mode and instrument power off. This was the first mechanical failure in nearly 10 years. Fermi&#x27;s solar arrays rotate to maximize the exposure of the arrays to the Sun. The motor that drives that rotation failed to move as instructed in one direction. On 27 March, the satellite was placed at a fixed angle relative to its orbit to maximize solar power. The next day the GBM instrument was turned back on. On 2 April, operators turned LAT on and it resumed operations on 8 April. Alternative observation strategies are being developed due to power and thermal requirements.

== Discoveries ==
=== Pulsar discovery ===
The first major discovery came when the space telescope detected a pulsar in the CTA 1 supernova remnant that appeared to emit radiation in the gamma ray bands only, the first of its kind. This new pulsar sweeps the Earth every 316.86 milliseconds and is about 4,600 light-years away.

=== Greatest gamma-ray burst energy release ===
In September 2008, the gamma-ray burst GRB 080916C in the constellation Carina was recorded by the Fermi telescope. This burst is notable as having &quot;the largest apparent energy release yet measured&quot;. The explosion had the power of about 9,000 ordinary supernovae, and the relativistic jet of material ejected in the blast must have moved at a minimum of 99.9999% the speed of light. Overall, GRB 080916C had &quot;the greatest total energy, the fastest motions, and the highest initial-energy emissions&quot; ever seen.

=== Galactic Center gamma ray excess ===
In 2009, a surplus of gamma rays from a spherical region around the Galactic Center of the Milky Way was found in data from the Fermi telescope. This is now known as the Galactic Center GeV excess. The source of this surplus is not known. Suggestions include self-annihilation of dark matter or a population of pulsars.

=== Cosmic rays and supernova remnants ===
In February 2010, it was announced that Fermi-LAT had determined that supernova remnants act as enormous accelerators for cosmic particles. This determination fulfills one of the stated missions for this project.

=== Background gamma ray sources ===

In March 2010 it was announced that active galactic nuclei are not responsible for most gamma-ray background radiation. Though active galactic nuclei do produce some of the gamma-ray radiation detected here on Earth, less than 30% originates from these sources. The search now is to locate the sources for the remaining 70% or so of all gamma-rays detected. Possibilities include star forming galaxies, galactic mergers, and yet-to-be explained dark matter interactions.

=== Milky Way Gamma- and X-ray emitting Fermi bubbles ===

In November 2010, it was announced that two gamma-ray and X-ray emitting bubbles were detected around our galaxy, the Milky Way. The bubbles, named Fermi bubbles, extend about 25 thousand light-years distant above and below the galactic center. The galaxy&#x27;s diffuse gamma-ray fog hampered prior observations, but the discovery team led by D. Finkbeiner, building on research by G. Dobler, worked around this problem.

=== Highest energy light ever seen from the Sun ===
In early 2012, Fermi/GLAST observed the highest energy light ever seen in a solar eruption.

=== Terrestrial gamma-ray flash observations ===
Fermi telescope has observed and detected numerous terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and discovered that such flashes can produce 100 trillion positrons, far more than scientists had previously expected.

=== GRB 130427A ===

On 27 April 2013, Fermi detected GRB 130427A, a gamma-ray burst with one of the highest energy outputs yet recorded.
This included detection of a gamma-ray over 94 billion electron volts (GeV). This broke Fermi&#x27;s previous record detection, by over three times the amount.

=== GRB coincident with gravitational wave event GW150914 ===
Fermi reported that its GBM instrument detected a weak gamma-ray burst above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%. However, observations from the INTEGRAL telescope&#x27;s all-sky SPI-ACS instrument indicated that any energy emission in gamma-rays and hard X-rays from the event was less than one millionth of the energy emitted as gravitational waves, concluding that &quot;this limit excludes the possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray radiation, directed towards the observer.&quot; If the signal observed by the Fermi GBM was associated with GW150914, SPI-ACS would have detected it with a significance of 15 sigma above the background. The AGILE space telescope also did not detect a gamma-ray counterpart of the event. A follow-up analysis of the Fermi report by an independent group, released in June 2016, purported to identify statistical flaws in the initial analysis, concluding that the observation was consistent with a statistical fluctuation or an Earth albedo transient on a 1-second timescale. A rebuttal of this follow-up analysis, however, pointed out that the independent group misrepresented the analysis of the original Fermi GBM Team paper and therefore misconstrued the results of the original analysis. The rebuttal reaffirmed that the false coincidence probability is calculated empirically and is not refuted by the independent analysis.

In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, 1.7 billion light years away from Earth, may be analogous to the historic GW170817. It was detected on 1 January 2015 at 15:23:35 UT by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, along with detections by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Swift Observatory Satellite.

Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. Avi Loeb has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star&#x27;s collapse it triggers a gamma-ray burst. Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves.

=== GRB 170817A signals a multi-messenger transient ===
On 17 August 2017, Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor software detected, classified, and localized a gamma-ray burst which was later designated as GRB 170817A. Six minutes later, a single detector at Hanford LIGO registered a gravitational-wave candidate which was consistent with a binary neutron star merger, occurring 2 seconds before the GRB 170817A event. This observation was &quot;the first joint detection of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation from a single source&quot;.

== Instruments ==

=== Gamma-ray Burst Monitor ===
The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) (formerly GLAST Burst Monitor) detects sudden flares of gamma-rays produced by gamma ray bursts and solar flares. Its scintillators are on the sides of the spacecraft to view all of the sky which is not blocked by the Earth. The design is optimized for good resolution in time and photon energy, and is sensitive from (a medium X-ray) to (a medium-energy gamma-ray).

&quot;Gamma-ray bursts are so bright we can see them from billions of light-years away, which means they occurred billions of years ago, and we see them as they looked then&quot;, stated Charles Meegan of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center.

The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor has detected gamma rays from positrons generated in powerful thunderstorms.

=== Large Area Telescope ===
The Large Area Telescope (LAT) detects individual gamma rays using technology similar to that used in terrestrial particle accelerators. Photons hit thin metal sheets, converting to electron-positron pairs, via a process termed pair production. These charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon microstrip detectors, causing ionization which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge. Researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles. After passing through the tracker, the particles enter the calorimeter, which consists of a stack of caesium iodide scintillator crystals to measure the total energy of the particles. The LAT&#x27;s field of view is large, about 20% of the sky. The resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards, a few arc minutes for the highest-energy photons and about 3 degrees at 100 MeV. It is sensitive from to (from medium up to some very-high-energy gamma rays). The LAT is a bigger and better successor to the EGRET instrument on NASA&#x27;s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite in the 1990s. Several countries produced the components of the LAT, who then sent the components for assembly at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. SLAC also hosts the LAT Instrument Science Operations Center, which supports the operation of the LAT during the Fermi mission for the LAT scientific collaboration and for NASA.

== Education and public outreach ==
Education and public outreach are important components of the Fermi project. The main Fermi education and public outreach website at http://glast.sonoma.edu offers gateways to resources for students, educators, scientists, and the public. NASA&#x27;s Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) group operates the Fermi education and outreach resources at Sonoma State University.

== Rossi Prize ==
The 2011 Bruno Rossi Prize was awarded to Bill Atwood, Peter Michelson and the Fermi LAT team &quot;for enabling, through the development of the Large Area Telescope, new insights into neutron stars, supernova remnants, cosmic rays, binary systems, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts.&quot;

In 2013, the prize was awarded to Roger W. Romani of Leland Stanford Junior University and Alice Harding of Goddard Space Flight Center for their work in developing the theoretical framework underpinning the many exciting pulsar results from Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

The 2014 prize went to Tracy Slatyer, Douglas Finkeiner and Meng Su &quot;for their discovery, in gamma rays, of the large unanticipated Galactic structure called the Fermi bubbles.&quot;

The 2018 prize was awarded to Colleen Wilson-Hodge and the Fermi GBM team for the detection of , the first unambiguous and completely independent discovery of an electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave signal (GW170817) that &quot;confirmed that short gamma-ray bursts are produced by binary neutron star mergers and enabled a global multi-wavelength follow-up campaign.&quot;

<text>The dusky thrush (Turdus eunomus) is a member of the thrush family which breeds eastwards from central Siberia to Kamchatka wintering in Korea, Japan, South China and Myanmar. It is closely related to the more southerly breeding Naumann&#x27;s thrush &quot;T. naumanni&quot;; the two have often been regarded as conspecific. The scientific name comes from Latin &quot;Turdus&quot;, &quot;thrush&quot; and Ancient Greek &quot;eunomos&quot;, &quot;orderly&quot;.

This species breeds in open woodland areas, but unlike Naumann&#x27;s thrush, the dusky thrush is more tolerant of mountainous and tundra-edge habitats. This species is strongly migratory, wintering south to southeast Asia, principally in China and neighbouring countries. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe. In December 2016 a sighting of one in the Derbyshire in the United Kingdom brought hundreds of birdwatchers to see it.
It nests in trees, laying 3-5 eggs in an untidy but neatly lined nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form small flocks. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, especially mosquitoes, earthworms and berries.

This is a medium-sized but stocky thrush, reminiscent in structure of a small fieldfare. The underwing is reddish brown, and there is a pale .

Dusky thrush has a dark brown back and rump; the face, breast, and flank spots rump are black and the belly and undertail are white. Naumann&#x27;s thrush in comparison has a paler brown back and head; the face, breast, flank spots and rump are reddish, and the belly and undertail are white.

The female is fairly similar to the male, but immatures have a weaker patterning.

The male dusky thrush has a simple fluted or whistling song, similar to the redwing. There are suggestions that the songs of dusky and Naumann&#x27;s thrush differ.

<text>The Fleer Corporation, founded by Frank H. Fleer in 1885, was the first company to successfully manufacture bubble gum; it remained a family-owned enterprise until 1989.

Fleer originally developed a bubble gum formulation called &quot;Blibber-Blubber&quot; in 1906. While this gum could be blown into bubbles, in other respects it was vastly inferior to regular chewing gum, and Blibber-Blubber was never marketed to the public. In 1928, Fleer employee Walter Diemer improved the Blibber-Blubber formulation to produce the first commercially successful bubble gum, Dubble Bubble. Its pink color set a tradition for nearly all bubble gums to follow. 

Fleer became known as a maker of sports cards, starting in 1923 with the production of baseball cards. Fleer also released American football (1960) and basketball (1986) card sets through its history.

The company also produced some non-sports trading cards. In 1995, Fleer merged with the trading card company SkyBox International and, over Thanksgiving vacation shuttered its Philadelphia plant (where Dubble Bubble had been made for 67 years). In 1998, 70-year-old Dubble Bubble was acquired by Canadian company Concord Confections; Concord, in turn, was acquired by Chicago-based Tootsie Roll Industries in 2004.

In late May 2005, news circulated that Fleer was suspending its trading card operations immediately. By early July, in a move similar to declaring bankruptcy, the company began to liquidate its assets to repay creditors. The move included the auction of the Fleer trade name, as well as other holdings. Competitor Upper Deck won the Fleer name, as well as their die cast toy business, at a price of $6.1 million. Just one year earlier, Upper Deck tendered an offer of $25 million, which was rejected by Fleer based on the hope that the sports card market would turn in a direction more favorable to their licenses and target collector demographic. One negative aspect associated with Fleer&#x27;s Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors is that many sports card collectors now own redemption cards for autographs and memorabilia that may not be able to be redeemed; those fears were somewhat quenched in early 2006 when random memorabilia cards were mailed to the aforementioned collectors.

==Beginning and early card attempts==

The Fleer company was started by Frank H. Fleer in Philadelphia, 1885, as a confectionery business. Well established as a gum and candy company, Fleer predated many of its competitors into the business of issuing sports cards with its 1923 release of baseball cards in its &quot;Bobs and Fruit Hearts&quot; candy product. These rare cards are basically the same as the 1923 W515 strip cards but are machine cut and have a printed ad for the candy company on the back. Many years later in 1959 it signed baseball star Ted Williams to a contract and sold an 80-card set oriented around highlights of his career. Fleer was unable to include other players because rival company Topps had signed most active baseball players to exclusive contracts.

Williams was nearing the end of his career and retired after the 1960 season. Fleer continued to produce baseball cards by featuring Williams with other mostly retired players in a &quot;Baseball Greats&quot; series. One set was produced in 1960 and a second in 1961. The company did not produce new cards the next year, but continued selling the 1961 set while it focused on signing enough players to produce a set featuring active players in 1963. This 67-card set included a number of stars, including 1962 National League MVP Maury Wills (then holder of the modern record for stolen bases in a season), who had elected to sign with Fleer instead of Topps. Wills and Jimmy Piersall served as player representatives for Fleer, helping to bring others on board. Topps still held the rights to most players and the set was not particularly successful.

Meanwhile, Fleer took advantage of the emergence of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 to begin producing football cards. Fleer produced a set for the AFL while Topps cards covered the established National Football League. In 1961, each company produced cards featuring players from both leagues. The next year reverted to the status quo ante, with Fleer covering the AFL and Topps the NFL. In 1964, Philadelphia Gum secured the rights for NFL cards and Topps took over the AFL.

Sometime after 1961 Fleer produced The Three Stooges&#x27; cards.

==Legal battles==

This left Fleer with no product in either baseball or football. The company now turned its efforts to supporting an administrative complaint filed against Topps by the Federal Trade Commission. The complaint focused on the baseball card market, alleging that Topps was engaging in unfair competition through its aggregation of exclusive contracts. A hearing examiner ruled against Topps in 1965, but the Commission reversed this decision on appeal. The Commission concluded that because the contracts only covered the sale of cards with gum, competition was still possible by selling cards with other small, low-cost products. Fleer chose not to pursue such options and instead sold its remaining player contracts to Topps for $395,000 in 1966($3,344,211.42 in 2021 dollars). The decision gave Topps an effective monopoly of the baseball card market.

In 1968, Fleer was approached by the Major League Baseball Players Association, a recently organized players&#x27; union, about obtaining a group license to produce cards. The MLBPA was in a dispute with Topps over player contracts, and offered Fleer the exclusive rights to market cards of most players starting in 1973, when many of Topps&#x27;s contracts would expire. Since this was so far in the future, Fleer declined the proposal.

Fleer returned to the union in September 1974 with a proposal to sell 5-by-7-inch satin patches of players, somewhat larger than normal baseball cards. By now, the MLBPA had settled its differences with Topps and reached an agreement that gave Topps a right of first refusal on such offers. Topps passed on the opportunity, indicating that it did not think the product would be successful. The union, also fearing that it would cut into existing royalties from Topps sales, then rejected the proposal.

In April 1975, Fleer asked for Topps to waive its exclusive rights and allow Fleer to produce stickers, stamps, or other small items featuring active baseball players. Topps refused, and Fleer then sued both Topps and the MLBPA to break the Topps monopoly. After several years of litigation, the Topps monopoly on baseball cards was finally broken by a lawsuit decided by federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer in 1980, in which the judge ended Topps&#x27;s exclusive right to sell baseball cards with gum, allowing Fleer to compete in the market. The court ordered the union to offer group licenses for baseball cards to companies other than Topps. Fleer and another company, Donruss, were thus allowed to begin making cards in 1981. Fleer&#x27;s legal victory was overturned after one season, but the company continued to manufacture cards, substituting stickers with team logos for gum.

==Bill Ripken==
In 1989, Bill Ripken&#x27;s Fleer card showed him holding a bat with the expletive &quot;fuck face&quot; written in plain view on the knob of the bat. Fleer subsequently rushed to correct the error, and in its haste, released versions in which the text was scrawled over with a marker, whited out with correction fluid, and also airbrushed. On the final, corrected version, Fleer obscured the offensive words with a black box (this was the version included in all factory sets). Both the original card and many of the corrected versions have become collector&#x27;s items as a result. There are at least ten different variations of this card. As of February 2009 the white out version has a book value of $120, but has been sold in mint condition on eBay for asking prices as high as $400. Years later, Ripken admitted he wrote the expletive on the bat to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and did not intend to use it for the card.

Some collectors list the card as the &quot;Rick Face&quot; card. The script on the bat appears to make the word &quot;fuck&quot; look similar to &quot;Rick&quot;.

==Key card sets==
Fleer produced two benchmark trading cards in the 1980s. In 1984, Fleer was the only major trading card manufacturer to release a Roger Clemens card; they included the then-Boston Red Sox prospect in their 1984 Fleer Baseball Update Set. The 1984 update set also included the first licensed card of Hall Of Fame outfielder Kirby Puckett. Fleer also released factory sets of their baseball cards from 1986-92. Like the Topps factory sets, they came in colorful boxes for retail and plainer boxes for hobby dealers. The 1986 set was not sealed, but the 1987-89 sets were sealed with a sticker and the 1990-92 sets were shrink-wrapped.

In 1986 Fleer helped resurrect the basketball card industry by releasing an officially NBA-licensed 132-card 1986-87 Fleer Basketball set which included the rookie cards of NBA Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Chris Mullin, Clyde Drexler, Joe Dumars, Hakeem Olajuwon, Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley. The set also included an additional 11 card All Star sticker set featuring a second rookie card/sticker of Michael Jordan. This set is seen by many basketball card collectors as the &quot;1952 Topps of basketball.&quot; From 1986-1989, Fleer was the only major card company that produced basketball cards. In 1990 Hoops, SkyBox, Topps and Upper Deck card companies introduced their own basketball cards and sets in two major releases each year per company. Each of these manufacturers, including Fleer, over-produced their basketball card product for half-a-dozen years, glutting the basketball card market. Over 500,000.00 1986-87 Fleer basketball boxes were manufactured in print run. Less than 1,000., factory sealed authenticated boxes are known to exist currently...

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the glossy parallel sets Fleer produced for their 1987-89 baseball sets (similar to the Topps Tiffany sets) became very popular in the hobby. That popularity wore off, and today, the sets (except for the rare 1989) are not worth much more than the regular sets.

Fleer&#x27;s first Ultra set came out in 1991, which in some years was released earlier than its regular Fleer (Tradition) set. The 1991 set had an announced production of 15% of regular Fleer and this set was produced on higher quality card stock and used silver ink, just like Donruss&#x27; Leaf set starting the previous year. The 1992 set used UV coating on both sides and gold foil stamping on the front, which was among the most beautiful sets of that year. 1994&#x27;s Ultra and regular Fleer sets began another tradition of offering an insert card in every pack and the next year started another tradition called &quot;hot packs&quot; (where about 1:72 packs contained &quot;only&quot; insert cards. An assortment of the easier to find insert cards and not the rare 1:36 100% foil cards). Still another tradition that continues today is the Ultra Gold Medallion parallel insert set, which started in 1995 and also included all the insert sets for the first two years. These are inserted one per pack. In 1997, Ultra introduced the Platinum Medallion insert set which is traditionally serial numbered to 100. 1998 saw the introduction of the purple Ultra Masterpieces, which are one of ones, and started the tradition of including short printed cards in the regular, Gold and Platinum sets.

Fleer&#x27;s super premium flagship set, called Flair, began production in 1993 with an announced production run as 15% of Ultra. Its trademark was that it was printed on very thick card stock (about twice the thickness of regular cards), used a unique glossy finish along with six color printing. The &quot;packs&quot; are done by [[shrink wrapping the cards (usually ten in a &quot;pack&quot;) and then placing them in a shrink-wrapped &quot;mini-box&quot; instead of the usual single slick foil packs used on virtually all trading card products today. The 1996/1997 Flair Showcase basketball box set included the first one-of-one cards for any major sport called &quot;Masterpieces&quot; This box was printed as the same year as the 1996 Upper Deck SPX and the 1996 Topps Chrome. AKA the golden era of basketball print run.

Fleer acquired a license deal from [[WWE]] to produce and distribute WWE [[trading cards]] from 2001 to 2004.

==Acquisitions==
The Fleer family, Frank Fleer&#x27;s descendants, sold Fleer in 1989 for just under US$70,000,000 to John W. Fleer and Charter House Investments. John W. Fleer retained majority ownership in the company. Fleer was pushing into retail chains like Rite Aid, which brought the ire of the hobby dealers in the early 1990s.

Comic book company [[Marvel Entertainment]] purchased the company on July 24, 1992, for US$540 million. Marvel purchased another card company, [[SkyBox International]], on March 8, 1995, for $150 million. Fleer/Skybox reduced its push into retail chains to start its Hobby Bullpen program that committed the company to support and provide relief for hobby dealers and collectors.

Marvel entered bankruptcy in 1996 along with its subsidiaries. Fleer was directly hurt by the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]] and [[NBA lockout|prolonged lockouts]] in the NBA. In June 1997, Marvel formed its Marvel Enterprise division, headed by president and CEO Scott C. Marden, to manage its trading card and sticker businesses, as well as Marvel Interactive, an [[Internet]]-entertainment and software-publishing company.

Fleer was placed on the market by Marvel at an asking price of $30 million. Fleer exited bankruptcy, along with the rest of the Marvel group, on October 1, 1998. In February 1999, Fleer/Skybox was sold to a corporation owned by [[Alex Grass]] and his son Roger.

In early 2005, Fleer announced that it would cease all productions of [[trading card]]s and file an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, which is a State Court liquidation, similar to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In July 2005, [[Upper Deck]] acquired the rights to the Fleer name and began producing Fleer-branded [[basketball card|basketball]], [[hockey card|ice hockey]] and [[American Football Card|American football]] cards. The $6.1 million Upper Deck paid for the Fleer name was significantly less than the $25 million they had offered to buy out Fleer a year earlier.

In 2006, Upper Deck produced baseball sets under the names Fleer, Fleer Ultra, Fleer Tradition, Flair, Skybox Autographics and Fleer Greats of the Game. The last Fleer-branded baseball cards appeared in 2007.

<text>Jeri Lynn Ryan (née Zimmermann; born February 22, 1968) is an American actress best known for her role as the former Borg drone Seven of Nine in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (19972001), for which she was nominated four times for a Saturn Award and won in 2001. She reprised her role as Seven of Nine in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (20202023), for which she won another Saturn Award.

She is also known for her role as Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Cooke on &quot;Boston Public&quot; (2001–2004), and as a regular on the science fiction series &quot;Dark Skies&quot; (1997) and the legal drama series &quot;Shark&quot; (2006–2008). In 2009 she guest-starred on the series &quot;Leverage&quot; as Tara Cole. From 2011 to 2013, she starred as Dr. Kate Murphy in the ABC drama series &quot;Body of Proof&quot;, and from 2016 to 2019, she appeared as Veronica Allen on the Amazon Prime series &quot;Bosch&quot;.

==Early life==
Ryan was born Jeri Lynn Zimmermann on February 22, 1968, in Munich, West Germany, the daughter of Gerhard Florian &quot;Jerry&quot; Zimmermann, a master sergeant in the U.S. Army, and his wife Sharon, a social worker, with an older brother, Mark. Ryan grew up on Army posts in Kansas, Maryland, Hawaii, Georgia and Texas.

When she was 11, her father retired from the Army and the family settled in Paducah, Kentucky. She graduated from Lone Oak High School in 1986 as a National Merit Scholar, and then attended Northwestern University, where she was a member of the Alpha Phi sorority. She graduated from Northwestern in 1990 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theatre.

In 1989, Ryan was chosen as Miss Illinois. She competed in the Miss America 1990 pageant, where she finished as third runner-up.

==Career==

After college, Ryan pursued acting full-time in Los Angeles. She made her acting debut in &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, and followed that with guest-starring roles in television series such as &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; as well as TV movies.

She had a regular role as extraterrestrial investigator Juliet Stuart on the television series &quot;Dark Skies&quot;, which was cancelled after one season.

In 1997, Ryan was chosen for a role on the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as Seven of Nine, a Borg drone who was freed from the Borg&#x27;s collective consciousness. When she joined the cast in season four, ratings increased 60%.

She appeared in Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;. After &quot;Voyager&quot; ended in 2001, Ryan joined the cast of &quot;Boston Public&quot; as Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Cooke, a frustrated lawyer who becomes a high school teacher. David E. Kelley, the series&#x27; producer, wrote the role specifically for her. The series ended in 2004.

Ryan appeared in the romantic-comedy film &quot;Down with Love&quot; and as Lydia in the independent film &quot;Men Cry Bullets.&quot; Her first film lead was in &quot;The Last Man&quot; as the last woman left on Earth.

In 2005 she had a role in a TV pilot titled &quot;Commuters&quot;, a suburban version of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. She had a recurring role as Charlotte Morgan on &quot;The O.C.&quot; in 2005, and she guest-starred as Courtney Reece on David E. Kelley&#x27;s &quot;Boston Legal&quot; in 2006. Ryan then co-starred in the legal drama &quot;Shark&quot; as Los Angeles County District Attorney Jessica Devlin alongside series lead James Woods, but she did not return for episodes aired after the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike; she was credited in all four episodes. CBS cancelled the broadcast of the series after its season-two finale.

She guest-starred as defense attorney Patrice La Rue on the April 7, 2009, episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, her first role since giving birth to her daughter Gisele. Ryan next had a seven-episode role on the drama &quot;Leverage&quot; in season 2 as a grifter named Tara Cole, filling in while series regular Gina Bellman was on maternity leave.

She was in Kevin Tancharoen&#x27;s short film &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot; as Sonya Blade. Although originally a film, it was marketed as a web series, with previews scheduled to appear online in June 2010. The web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; officially launched in March 2011.

Ryan was a regular in the series &quot;Body of Proof&quot;, which premiered on March 29, 2011.

Ryan continued to appear in guest roles on genre television series, including the science fiction series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; as Marine Major Amanda Lattimer, ex-wife of the series&#x27; male lead character Pete Lattimer, in the episode &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;. She made a return guest appearance on the drama &quot;Leverage&quot; in season 4, episode 13 as grifter Tara Cole, in the episode &quot;The Girls&#x27; Night Out Job&quot;. She also appeared for a multi-episode arc in season 1 of the science fiction series &quot;Helix&quot;. She was next seen in the series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, reprising her role as Seven of Nine.

==Personal life==

In 1990, while dealing blackjack at a charity event, Ryan met investment banker and future Republican political candidate Jack Ryan. They married on June 15, 1991, in Wilmette, Illinois. They had a son, Alex, on August 15, 1994. Jeri commuted between Los Angeles and Wilmette during their marriage. They divorced on August 27, 1999. A few years after she joined the &quot;Voyager&quot; cast, Ryan began dating &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; producer Brannon Braga. Between February and November 2000, they were stalked by Marlon Estacio Pagtakhan, who was convicted for harassment and threats in May 2001.

When Jack Ryan&#x27;s campaign for an open United States Senate seat in Illinois began in 2003, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper and WLS-TV, the local ABC affiliate, sought to have his records released. Both Jeri and Jack agreed to make their divorce records, but not their custody records, public, saying the latter&#x27;s release could be harmful to their son.

On June 18, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider agreed to release the custody files. The decision went against both parents&#x27; direct requests and reversed the decision to seal the papers in the child&#x27;s best interest. It was revealed that six years earlier, Jeri accused Jack of asking her to perform sexual acts with him in public and in sex clubs in New York, New Orleans and Paris. Jeri described one venue as &quot;a bizarre club with cages, whips, and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling.&quot; Jack denied the allegations. Although Jeri only made a brief statement, and refused to comment on the matter during the campaign, the disclosure led Jack to withdraw his candidacy; his main opponent, Barack Obama, then won the 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois, flipping the Senate seat from Republican to Democratic.

According to statements she has made in interviews, Ryan&#x27;s main hobby is gourmet cooking. While starring in &quot;Boston Public&quot;, she moonlighted on weekends in the kitchen of the Los Angeles restaurant The House. In 2003, Ryan met French chef Christophe Émé at a chef&#x27;s charity event. They eventually began a relationship, and Émé moved in with Ryan and her son Alex in their home in San Fernando Valley. In February 2005, Ryan, a &quot;lifelong Francophile&quot;, opened—in partnership with Émé—the restaurant &quot;Ortolan.&quot; Located on Third Street in Los Angeles, California, it served French food with a modern interpretation. The two have appeared on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, where Émé and one sous-chef challenged Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto and his two sous-chefs. The restaurant is seen in season 2, episode 26 of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as Denny Crane (William Shatner) and Alan Shore (James Spader) discuss the arrival of Courtney Reece (Ryan) at &quot;her favorite restaurant.&quot; Despite its success, the restaurant was hit hard by the Great Recession and closed in December 2010.

Ryan and Émé married in the Loire Valley, France on June 16, 2007. In March 2008, she gave birth to a daughter in Los Angeles.

<text>Sir Billy Mackie Snedden, (31 December 1926 – 27 June 1987) was an Australian politician who served as the leader of the Liberal Party from 1972 to 1975. He was also a cabinet minister from 1964 to 1972, and Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1976 to 1983.

Snedden was born in Perth, Western Australia. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, and then studied law at the University of Western Australia. From 1951 to 1952, he was the inaugural federal chairman of the Young Liberal Movement. After a period working overseas for the Department of Immigration, Snedden returned to Australia in 1954 and settled in Melbourne. He was elected to the House of Representatives the following year, aged 28.

In 1964, Snedden was elevated to cabinet by Robert Menzies. He served as a government minister until the Liberal government&#x27;s defeat at the 1972 election, under an additional four prime ministers. Snedden spent periods as Attorney-General (1964–1966), Minister for Immigration (1966–1969), Minister for Labour and National Service (1969–1971), and Treasurer (1971–1972). He was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in 1971, and replaced William McMahon as leader after the following year&#x27;s election loss, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition.

Snedden led the Liberal Party to the 1974 federal election, which saw the Labor Party retain government with a narrow majority. Malcolm Fraser mounted two leadership challenges in early 1975, winning on the second attempt; by the end of the year he was prime minister. Snedden was elected to the speakership when the parliament next sat. He held the position for almost seven years, gaining a reputation for impartiality. In retirement, Snedden served as chairman of the Melbourne Football Club and on the board of the Victorian Football League. The unusual circumstances of his death in 1987, which involved the ex-girlfriend of his own son, attracted much public interest.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Snedden was born on 31 December 1926 at a private hospital in Newcastle Street, West Perth, Western Australia. He was the youngest of six children born to Catherine (née Mackie) and Alan Snedden. His mother was 43 years old when he was born, and his siblings, one sister and four brothers, were much older than him.

Snedden&#x27;s parents were born in Alva, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, and spoke &quot;broad Scots&quot;. His grandparents were illiterate, and his parents had only limited schooling; they were both from coal-mining families. They immigrated to Australia in 1912 with their three oldest children, initially settling in the remote mining town of Meekatharra. The family moved to Perth in about 1921, after their house in Meekatharra burned down.

Snedden&#x27;s father worked mostly as a stonemason, but also spent periods as a miner and general labourer when better work was not available. He reputedly left Scotland to escape a paternity suit, and had earlier been in trouble with the law for poaching. The family name was originally &quot;Snaddon&quot; (or &quot;Snadon&quot;), but was changed upon arrival in Australia.

===Childhood===
Snedden grew up in Perth&#x27;s inner north near the suburb of Highgate, living initially on Robinson Avenue and later on Bulwer Street. His father left home when he was about three or four years old, and they had only limited contact thereafter. His oldest brother Bob became the family&#x27;s main breadwinner, while his mother worked as a laundress and his other siblings also found jobs. He was close to his sister Jean, who often babysat him. Snedden worked part-time from about the age of eight, helping his brothers on construction sites and selling and delivering newspapers. He began his schooling at Highgate Primary School, and later attended the Perth Boys&#x27; School through to the ninth grade.

Snedden left school in April 1942 and began working as a junior law clerk for Thomas Hughes, who was a solicitor and independent state MP. He would not normally have been considered qualified for the job, but there was a shortage of applicants due to the war. Snedden was eventually able to receive his leaving certificate by attending night school at Perth Technical College. He fell out with Hughes late in 1943, and in January 1944 began working as a clerk at the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor&#x27;s office. He was a talented sportsman as a youth, and played a few games for the West Perth Football Club during the 1944 WANFL season, at a time when the competition was age-restricted. He later represented Western Australia at the Australian Amateur Football Carnival in Melbourne in 1951.

===Military service and university===
Snedden and two friends attempted to join the merchant navy at the age of 15, but were unsuccessful. He also attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy when he was 17, but his mother refused her permission; three of his brothers were already on active service. Snedden eventually enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in January 1945, two days after his 18th birthday. He began an air crew training scheme, but as the war came to an end he was taken off the course and given more general duties; this included a period tending bar at an officers&#x27; mess. He was discharged in September 1945.

As part of his demobilisation, Snedden completed aptitude tests which showed he would be a suitable candidate for a university education. In combination with his earlier clerking experience, this allowed him to secure a place at the University of Western Australia&#x27;s law school in 1946. Snedden failed two subjects in his first year, and was only able to continue when the law school dean Frank Beasley intervened on his behalf. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1950, and completed his articles of clerkship with Harvey, Slattery, and Gibson. He was called to the bar in December 1951.

==Professional career==
In 1951, Snedden briefly returned to the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor&#x27;s office. He resigned from the public service due to a pay cut, and began working for Angus &amp; Coote as a hearing aid salesman. In early 1952, he secured a position as a migration officer with the Department of Immigration. He and his family moved to Italy for sixteen months, initially living in Taormina, Sicily, and later in Rome. He learnt to speak Italian, and travelled around the country conducting interviews with prospective migrants. In November 1953, Snedden was transferred to England. He stayed there for a year, and was then supposed to be moved on to Germany. However, he decided to return to Australia, and in January 1955 moved to Melbourne to work in a legal advice bureau for ex-servicemen. He and his family settled in Ringwood.

==Political career==
===Early involvement===

Snedden was state president of the Young Liberals, and from 1951 to 1952 served as the inaugural federal chairman of the organisation. As president of the UWA Liberal Club, he became acquainted with future prime minister Bob Hawke, who was president of the Labor Club. As a student, he made three unsuccessful attempts to enter politics, standing for the Liberal Party at the 1948 Boulder state by-election and at the 1949 and 1951 federal elections (in Fremantle and Perth, respectively).

===Member of Parliament===
In 1954 Snedden moved to Melbourne, where he practised law until 1955, when he was elected to the House of Representatives for the outer suburban seat of Bruce. He defeated Keith Ewert, the former Labor member for nearby Flinders. Snedden defeated Ewert by a similar margin in 1958.

In 1961, Snedden faced Ewert again, and this time trailed in initial counting. However, he was elected on Democratic Labor Party preferences. Snedden&#x27;s narrow win was critical in the outcome of what was the closest election in Australian history up till that time. Had Labor won it, it would have toppled the Coalition after 12 years of rule. However, with Snedden&#x27;s win, the best Labor could hope for was a hung parliament, though the Coalition was not assured of another term in government until later in the night, with its narrow victory in Moreton.

===Cabinet===

He served in the ministries of Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, John McEwen, John Gorton and William McMahon. In March 1964 Menzies appointed him Attorney-General. In that capacity he played a significant role in the 1967 constitutional referendum affecting the status of Aboriginals. On 7 April 1965, the Menzies Cabinet decided that it would seek to repeal Section 127 of the Constitution, which excluded indigenous people from the population count, but made no firm plans or timetable for such action. In August 1965, Snedden proposed to Cabinet that abolition of Section 127 was inappropriate unless Section 51(xxvi) was simultaneously amended to remove the words &quot;other than the aboriginal race in any state&quot;. He was rebuffed, but he gained agreement when he made a similar submission to the Holt Cabinet in 1966. The referendum went ahead on 27 May 1967, and was resoundingly approved.

He was Minister for Immigration 1966–1969, and Minister for Labour and National Service 1969–1971, a difficult job which put him in charge of the government&#x27;s highly unpopular policy of conscription for the Vietnam War. In 1967, following the death of Harold Holt, he was a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party, but his candidacy was not taken very seriously.

As Minister for Labour and National Service, Snedden commented on anti-war and anti-conscription activists&#x27; demonstrations. On the eve of the first Moratorium, he said in Parliament that the marchers were &quot;political bikies pack-raping democracy&quot;. In 1971, Snedden was appointed Treasurer by William McMahon, and was elected Liberal Deputy Leader, making him the heir apparent to the leadership.

===Leader of the Opposition===

When McMahon was defeated by the Labor Party under Gough Whitlam in 1972, Snedden was elected as his replacement as Liberal leader, winning by a single vote over Nigel Bowen on the fifth ballot. Snedden promised a new and more &quot;liberal&quot; Liberal Party, but he suffered from his continuing image as a light-weight, and many Liberals believed he would never defeat Whitlam.

Snedden allowed himself to be persuaded to use the conservative majority in the Senate to block the Whitlam government&#x27;s budget in 1974. Whitlam promptly called a double dissolution election for 18 May, at which he was returned to office, albeit with a reduced majority. Labor campaigned on the slogan &quot;Oh no, not Snedden!&quot;. Snedden exposed himself to ridicule by refusing to concede defeat, saying at a press conference: &quot;We were not defeated. We did not win enough seats in order to form a government&quot;.

After the election the conservative wing of the Liberal Party, led by Malcolm Fraser, challenged Snedden&#x27;s leadership, but he was narrowly re-elected. When he failed to make any headway against Whitlam, Fraser mounted a second challenge, and Snedden was deposed in March 1975, becoming the first leader of the Liberal Party not to gain the prime ministership. He retired to the backbench until February 1976, when Fraser supported his election as Speaker of the House.

===Speaker of the House===
Snedden was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives on 17 February 1976, defeating the previous Speaker, Gordon Scholes, by a majority of 53 votes. He was re-elected on 21 February 1978, defeating Labor MP Dr Harry Jenkins by a majority of 44 votes, and on 25 November 1980, again defeating Dr Jenkins by a majority of 22 votes.

He was the last Speaker of the House of Representatives to wear the formal regalia of full-bottomed wig and gown inherited from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, believing that it would restore the dignity of the office of Speaker.

As Speaker, Snedden sought to enhance the role and assert its independence. He preferred the Speaker to be recognised as an impartial umpire like the Speaker of the House of Commons. In 1979, he published a paper outlining his proposals for adopting some of the Westminster conventions, namely that the Speaker remain in office for five to seven years then resign and hold no further public office, that the Speaker be unopposed by the major political parties at general elections, and that the Speaker resign from his or her party upon becoming Speaker.

Snedden tried to strengthen the Parliament&#x27;s ability to withstand pressures from the Executive. He believed that it was contrary to Parliament&#x27;s independence for the Executive to control the funds allocated to Parliament, so he authorised parliamentary officers to write a paper in 1976 entitled &quot;The Parliamentary Budget&quot;. He later wrote, &quot;You could not have a situation where the Executive decided the level at which Members could operate efficiently.&quot; This led to the introduction of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill in 1982.

One of his most memorable actions as Speaker occurred in February 1982, when a Labor frontbencher, Bob Hawke, referred to then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, as a &quot;liar&quot; during question time. Fraser was answering a question about two joint royal commissions being conducted in Victoria at the time. Fraser allegedly selectively quoted a statement by the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, John Cain, which provoked Hawke to call Fraser a liar. Snedden followed parliamentary procedure and asked Hawke to withdraw the remark. When Hawke refused, Snedden named him and a motion for his suspension was moved. Snedden later wrote: &quot;It was his [Fraser&#x27;s] instigation which was making the Parliament unworkable, not the Opposition&#x27;s response, like the classroom situation where the smart little man hits the fellow next to him who retaliates and is seen by the teacher&quot;. Members of the Opposition had by that point taken up &quot;liar&quot; as a chant, which put Snedden in the position where he would have to name every member, one by one. After realising that the House would be unworkable for that sitting day, he declined to put the motion for Hawke&#x27;s suspension.

Fraser was furious and attempted to intimidate Snedden into punishing Hawke for not withdrawing or take his &quot;punishment&quot;. Snedden refused and was convinced that he would be replaced as Speaker but, once Fraser realised that he had no support in the Liberal Party to remove Snedden from office, he sent a conciliatory message.

With the defeat of the Fraser government in 1983 and the election of Dr Harry Jenkins Sr. as Speaker, Snedden resigned from Parliament on 21 April 1983. In doing so, he honoured a feature of his 1979 paper. He believed that if he stayed in Parliament, he might be called on for advice on his successor&#x27;s rulings, which would be undesirable because it would undermine the Chair. He said, &quot;I am very conscious that, under the Westminster convention, when the Speaker leaves the chair he leaves the House. I think this is right.&quot; He formally resigned from Parliament later that day.

==Later life==
When the Fraser government was defeated by Hawke in 1983, Snedden immediately resigned from Parliament after 28 years of service. He separated from his wife, Lady Snedden, and was later to withdraw from public life as his health declined from atherosclerosis and heart disease. Snedden was Chairman of the Melbourne Football Club from 1981 to 1986, later a Director of the Victorian Football League and also Patron of the Professional Boxing Association of Australia.

===Death===
On 27 June 1987, just hours after attending John Howard&#x27;s election campaign launch, Snedden suffered a fatal heart attack at the Travelodge motel in Rushcutters Bay, Sydney, while having sex with an ex-girlfriend of his son Drew, identified only as &quot;Wendy&quot;. Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Truth&quot; headlined its report &quot;Snedden died on the job&quot;, while the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Snedden was wearing a condom and that &quot;it was loaded&quot;.

==Personal life==
Snedden married Joy Forsyth, a dental nurse, on 10 March 1950. They were separated but not divorced at the time of his death. They had two sons and two daughters together. His daughter Fiona was elected to the Melbourne City Council in 2004 after an unsuccessful candidature for the Liberal Party in the seat of Melbourne Ports in the 1998 federal election. She stood for re-election to council in 2008 but lost her seat.

==Honours==
Snedden was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in January 1978. He was appointed a Privy Councillor in 1972.

<text>was a well-known Japanese ceramic potter.

He lived and worked in Mino, near Nagoya. He was given the title &quot;Living National Treasure&quot; in 1955.

In 1930 he discovered shards at the site of the ruins of an &quot;ogama&quot; style kiln at Mutabora proving that that Shino and Oribe glazed work of the Momoyama and early Edo period in Japan had been manufactured in Mino rather than in the Seto area. In 1933 he built a kiln reproducing the original Mutabora kiln and rediscovered the techniques for manufacturing Shino glazes.

He died in Tokyo, Japan in 1985.

There is a translation of Arakawa&#x27;s &quot;The Traditions and Techniques of Mino Pottery&quot; in Janet Barriskill&#x27;s &quot;Visiting the Mino Kilns&quot; Wild Peony Press, Sydney, 1995.

His work is kept in several museums, including the Mills College Art Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Portland Art Museum, the ASU Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and the University of Michigan Museum of Art.

<doc id="399720" wikidata="Q235057" url="?curid=399720" title="Common rock thrush">
<text>The common rock thrush (Monticola saxatilis), also known as rufous-tailed rock thrush or simply rock thrush, is a chat belonging to the family Muscicapidae. It was formerly placed in the family Turdidae. The scientific name is from Latin. &quot;Monticola&quot; is from &quot;mons, montis&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;, and &quot;colere&quot;, &quot;to dwell&quot;, and &quot;saxatilis&quot; means &quot;rock-frequenting&quot;, from &quot;saxum&quot;, &quot;stone&quot; .

It breeds in southern Europe across Central Asia to northern China. This species is strongly migratory, all populations wintering in Africa south of the Sahara. It is an uncommon visitor to northern Europe. Its range has contracted somewhat at the periphery in recent decades due to habitat destruction. For example, in the early 20th century it bred in the Jura Krakowsko-Częstochowska (Poland) where none occur today, but it is not considered globally endangered.

==Description==

This is a medium-sized but stocky thrush 17–20 cm in length. The summer male is unmistakable, with a blue-grey head, orange underparts and outer tail feathers, dark brown wings and white back. Females and immatures are much less striking, with dark brown scaly upperparts, and paler brown scaly underparts. The outer tail feathers are reddish, like the male.

==Behaviour and ecology==

This species breeds in open dry hilly areas, usually above 1500 m. It nests in rock cavities, laying 4–5 eggs. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, berries and small reptiles. The male common rock thrush has a clear and tuneful song.

<doc id="399725" wikidata="Q691785" url="?curid=399725" title="Orgazmo">
<text>Orgazmo is a 1997 American superhero sex comedy film written, directed and edited by Trey Parker and produced by Matt Stone, Jason McHugh, and Fran Rubel Kuzui. It stars Parker, Stone, Dian Bachar, Robyn Lynne, and Michael Dean Jacobs. The plot follows Joe Young (Parker), a devout Mormon missionary who, to pay for his and his fiancée&#x27;s dream wedding and home, acts in a pornographic film as the superhero Orgazmo with his side-kick Choda Boy (Bachar).

==Plot==
Mormon missionary Joseph Young, assigned with his mission partner to Los Angeles, finds the city to be a hostile and unenthusiastic place for their work. The problems worsen when they knock on the door of sleazy porn director Maxxx Orbison and several security guards are sent to dispose of them. Joe defeats them all singlehandedly with a variety of martial arts skills. Impressed by his performance and bored by his current project&#x27;s lead actor, Orbison attempts to hire Joe to play the title character and lead of his pornographic superhero film, &quot;Orgazmo&quot;. Joe is conflicted because of his religious beliefs, but the $20,000 salary offered would pay for a wedding in the temple in Utah where his fiancée Lisa has expressed a strong desire to wed. After learning that a stunt cock would stand in for him during explicit close-up scenes, Joe reluctantly accepts despite being given a very clear sign from God to refuse.

Joe finds the crew of the film intimidating but befriends co-star Ben Chapleski, a technical genius and MIT alumnus who works in the pornographic industry to satiate his overactive libido. He plays Orgazmo&#x27;s sidekick Choda Boy, who assists Orgazmo with specially designed sex toys, including Orgazmo&#x27;s signature weapon, the Orgazmorator, a ray gun that forces orgasm upon whomever it is fired. Ben invites Joe to his home and shows Joe a real Orgazmorator he has built, and he and Joe spend an evening using it on unsuspecting citizens for amusement.

At a sushi bar owned by Ben&#x27;s Japanese friend G-Fresh, the two witness a group of thugs vandalizing the bar to force out G-Fresh so their dance club next door can expand. Later, when Ben and Joe are gone, G-Fresh is coerced to leave after the same thugs assault him. Upon finding this out, Joe and Ben don costumes and use their film props and the Orgazmorator to sneak into the club and steal back the contract G-Fresh was forced to sign. Joe is agitated after nearly being shot in the head, but Ben is excited by being a real superhero.

&quot;Orgazmo&quot; becomes an amazing success, both financially and critically, and Orbison withholds Joe&#x27;s paycheck to keep him in town long enough to announce a sequel. Tempted by a doubled salary, Joe is confronted by Lisa, who has found out what he has been doing and leaves him. Facing production difficulties and harassment from Orbison&#x27;s unsympathetic nephew A-Cup, Joe tries to back out of the project, but Orbison refuses. When Joe stands up to him, Orbison has Lisa kidnapped. Ben realizes the thugs who assaulted G-Fresh work for Orbison, and he joins Joe in storming Orbison&#x27;s mansion before Lisa can be forced to perform in one of Orbison&#x27;s films.

Fighting through Orbison&#x27;s group of henchmen, Joe and Ben meet their match in A-Cup. Joe encourages Ben to unleash his long-repressed Hamster Style discipline of martial arts, allowing Ben to beat A-Cup. After repairing his damaged Orgazmorator, Joe repeatedly shoots Orbison with it, incapacitating him and capturing all the henchmen. Ben blows up the mansion with another device, the &quot;Cock Rocket&quot;, destroying Orbison&#x27;s base of operations. Joe and Lisa reconcile, and she gives him her blessing to remain in Los Angeles and continue being a hero alongside Ben.

A doctor tells Orbison that after so many orgasms in a row, his testicles have swollen to the size of oranges, and surgical removal is the only option. A now insane Orbison declares revenge on Orgazmo and becomes the personification of A-Cup&#x27;s character, who is immune to the Orgazmorator: Neutered Man.

==Release==
&quot;Orgazmo&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1997. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film an NC-17 rating, resulting in a very limited release in the US. An unrated version was released on the two-sided DVD set along with the theatrical version; it is two minutes shorter than the original 94-minute release. The film was released via Blu-ray on May 12, 2015. This includes both versions of the film and all the features from the DVD.

==Critical reception==
As of September 2022, the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 48% and an average rating of 4.90/10 based on 33 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus read: &quot;More juvenile than provocative, &quot;Orgazmo&quot; may have enough good-natured raunch to satisfy writer-director Trey Parker&#x27;s fans, but its satire is too soft to compete with the &quot;South Park&quot; co-creator&#x27;s best work.&quot; As of September 2020, the film had a score of 48 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film half a star out of four, arguing that &quot;Orgazmo&quot; had little of the clever wit Parker and Stone brought to &quot;South Park&quot; and calling it &quot;callow, gauche, obvious and awkward, and designed to appeal to those with similar qualities&quot;. On the other hand, James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;crude, rude, profane, and funny&quot; and the kind of movie that makes &quot;for a great event at parties&quot;.

&quot;Orgazmo&quot; has been deemed a cult film, mostly by fans of &quot;South Park&quot;, which Parker and Stone subsequently released to critical acclaim. Its reception and rating by the MPAA is discussed in the 2006 documentary &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;.

<text>In geometry, the problem of dividing a [[circle]] into areas by means of an inscribed polygon with &quot;n&quot; sides in such a way as to &quot;maximise&quot; the number of areas created by the edges and diagonals, sometimes called Moser&#x27;s circle problem (named after Leo Moser), has a solution by an inductive method. The greatest possible number of regions, formula_1, giving the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 57, 99, 163, 256, ... (). Though the first five terms match the geometric progression , it deviates at , showing the risk of generalising from only a few observations.

== Lemma ==
If there are &quot;n&quot; points on the circle and one more point is added, &quot;n&quot; lines can be drawn from the new point to the previously existing points. Two cases are possible. In the first case (a), the new line passes through a point where two or more old lines (between previously existing points) cross. In the second case (b), the new line crosses each of the old lines in a different point. It will be useful to know the following fact.

Lemma. The new point &quot;A&quot; can be chosen so that case &quot;b&quot; occurs for each of the new lines

Proof. For the case &quot;a&quot;, three points must be on one line: the new point &quot;A&quot;, the old point &quot;O&quot; to which the line is drawn, and the point &quot;I&quot; where two of the old lines intersect. There are &quot;n&quot; old points &quot;O&quot;, and hence finitely many points &quot;I&quot; where two of the old lines intersect. For each &quot;O&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, the line &quot;OI&quot; crosses the circle in one point other than &quot;O&quot;. Since the circle has infinitely many points, it has a point &quot;A&quot; which will be on none of the lines &quot;OI&quot;. Then, for this point &quot;A&quot; and all of the old points &quot;O&quot;, case &quot;b&quot; will be true.

This lemma means that, if there are &quot;k&quot; lines crossing &quot;AO&quot;, then each of them crosses &quot;AO&quot; at a different point and &quot;k&quot; + 1 new areas are created by the line &quot;AO&quot;.

== Solution ==

=== Inductive method ===

The lemma establishes an important property for solving the problem. By employing an inductive proof, one can arrive at a formula for &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) in terms of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1).

In the figure the dark lines are connecting points 1 through 4 dividing the circle into 8 total regions (i.e., &quot;f&quot;(4) = 8). This figure illustrates the inductive step from &quot;n&quot; = 4 to &quot;n&quot; = 5 with the dashed lines. When the fifth point is added (i.e., when computing &quot;f&quot;(5) using &quot;f&quot;(4)), this results in four new lines (the dashed lines in the diagram) being added, numbered 1 through 4, one for each point that they connect to. The number of new regions introduced by the fifth point can therefore be determined by considering the number of regions added by each of the 4 lines. Set &quot;i&quot; to count the lines being added. Each new line can cross a number of existing lines, depending on which point it is to (the value of &quot;i&quot;). The new lines will never cross each other, except at the new point.

The number of lines that each new line intersects can be determined by considering the number of points on the &quot;left&quot; of the line and the number of points on the &quot;right&quot; of the line. Since all existing points already have lines between them, the number of points on the left multiplied by the number of points on the right is the number of lines that will be crossing the new line. For the line to point &quot;i&quot;, there are

: &quot;n&quot; − &quot;i&quot; − 1

points on the left and

: &quot;i&quot; − 1

points on the right, so a total of

: (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;i&quot; − 1) (&quot;i&quot; − 1)

lines must be crossed.

In this example, the lines to &quot;i&quot; = 1 and &quot;i&quot; = 4 each cross zero lines,
while the lines to &quot;i&quot; = 2 and &quot;i&quot; = 3 each cross two lines (there are two
points on one side and one on the other).

So the recurrence can be expressed as

: formula_2

which can be easily reduced to

: formula_3

Using the sums of the first formula_4 natural numbers and the first formula_4 squares, this combines to

: formula_6

Finally,

: formula_7 with formula_8

which yields

: formula_9

=== Combinatorics and topology method ===

The lemma asserts that the number of regions is maximal if all &quot;inner&quot; intersections of chords are simple (exactly two chords pass through each point of intersection in the interior). This will be the case if the points on the circle are chosen &quot;in general position&quot;. Under this assumption of &quot;generic intersection&quot;, the number of regions can also be determined in a non-inductive way, using the formula for the Euler characteristic of a connected planar graph (viewed here as a graph embedded in the 2-sphere S 2).

A planar graph determines a cell decomposition of the plane with &quot;F&quot; faces (2-dimensional cells), &quot;E&quot; edges (1-dimensional cells) and &quot;V&quot; vertices (0-dimensional cells). As the graph is connected, the Euler relation for the 2-dimensional sphere S 2 
:formula_10
holds. View the diagram (the circle together with all the chords) above as a planar graph. If the general formulas for &quot;V&quot; and &quot;E&quot; can both be found, the formula for &quot;F&quot; can also be derived, which will solve the problem.

Its vertices include the &quot;n&quot; points on the circle, referred to as the exterior vertices, as well as the interior vertices, the intersections of distinct chords in the interior of the circle. The &quot;generic intersection&quot; assumption made above guarantees that each interior vertex is the intersection of no more than two chords.

Thus the main task in determining &quot;V&quot; is finding the number of interior vertices. As a consequence of the lemma, any two intersecting chords will uniquely determine an interior vertex. These chords are in turn uniquely determined by the four corresponding endpoints of the chords, which are all exterior vertices. Any four exterior vertices determine a cyclic quadrilateral, and all cyclic quadrilaterals are convex quadrilaterals, so each set of four exterior vertices have exactly one point of intersection formed by their diagonals (chords). Further, by definition &quot;all&quot; interior vertices are formed by intersecting chords.

Therefore, each interior vertex is uniquely determined by a combination of four exterior vertices, where the number of interior vertices is given by
:formula_11
and so
:formula_12

The edges include the &quot;n&quot; circular arcs connecting pairs of adjacent exterior vertices, as well as the chordal line segments (described below) created inside the circle by the collection of chords. Since there are two groups of vertices: exterior and interior, the chordal line segments can be further categorized into three groups:
# Edges directly (not cut by other chords) connecting two exterior vertices. These are chords between adjacent exterior vertices, and form the perimeter of the polygon. There are &quot;n&quot; such edges.
# Edges connecting two interior vertices.
# Edges connecting an interior and exterior vertex.

To find the number of edges in groups 2 and 3, consider each interior vertex, which is connected to exactly four edges. This yields
:formula_13
edges. Since each edge is defined by two endpoint vertices, only the interior vertices were enumerated, group 2 edges are counted twice while group 3 edges are counted once only.

Every chord that is cut by another (i.e., chords not in group 1) must contain two group 3 edges, its beginning and ending chordal segments. As chords are uniquely determined by two exterior vertices, there are altogether
:formula_14
group 3 edges. This is twice the total number of chords that are not themselves members of group 1.

The sum of these results divided by two gives the combined number of edges in groups 2 and 3. Adding the &quot;n&quot; edges from group 1, and the &quot;n&quot; circular arc edges brings the total to
:formula_15

Substituting &quot;V&quot; and &quot;E&quot; into the Euler relation solved for &quot;F&quot;, formula_16 one then obtains
:formula_17

Since one of these faces is the exterior of the circle, the number of regions &quot;r&quot;&quot;G&quot; inside the circle is &quot;F&quot; − 1, or

:formula_18

which resolves to

:formula_19

which yields the same quartic polynomial obtained by using the inductive method

:formula_20
The fifth column of Bernoulli&#x27;s triangle (&quot;k&quot; = 4) gives the maximum number of regions in the problem of dividing a circle into areas for &quot;n&quot; + 1 points, where &quot;n&quot; ≥ 4.

==Application to mathematical billiards inside the circle==

Considering the force-free motion of a particle inside a circle it was shown (see D. Jaud) that for specific reflection angles along the circle boundary the associated area division sequence is given by an arithmetic series.

==Evenly-spaced points==

If the points are uniformly spaced around the circle, the number of regions is reduced for even &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4, yielding the OEIS sequence A006533:

Though the number of divisors of &quot;n&quot;! for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 also start with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30, the following terms (60, 96, 160, 270, 540, 792, ...) diverge from the above.

<doc id="399735" wikidata="Q1987244" url="?curid=399735" title="Liberal feminism">
<text>Liberal feminism, also called mainstream feminism, is a main branch of feminism defined by its focus on achieving gender equality through political and legal reform within the framework of liberal democracy and informed by a human rights perspective. It is often considered culturally progressive and economically center-right to center-left. As the oldest of the &quot;Big Three&quot; schools of feminist thought, liberal feminism has its roots in 19th century first-wave feminism seeking recognition of women as equal citizens, focusing particularly on women&#x27;s suffrage and access to education, the effort associated with 19th century liberalism and progressivism. Liberal feminism &quot;works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure.&quot; Liberal feminism places great emphasis on the public world, especially laws, political institutions, education and working life, and considers the denial of equal legal and political rights as the main obstacle to equality. As such liberal feminists have worked to bring women into the political mainstream. Liberal feminism is inclusive and socially progressive, while broadly supporting existing institutions of power in liberal democratic societies, and is associated with centrism and reformism. Liberal feminism tends to be adopted by white middle-class women who do not disagree with the current social structure; Zhang and Rios found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and &quot;default&quot; form of feminism. Liberal feminism actively supports men&#x27;s involvement in feminism and both women and men have always been active participants in the movement; progressive men had an important role alongside women in the struggle for equal political rights since the movement was launched in the 19th century.

Historically, liberal feminism largely grew out of and was often associated with social liberalism; the modern liberal feminist tradition notably includes both social liberal and social democratic streams, as well as many often diverging schools of thought such as equality feminism, social feminism, care-ethical liberal feminism, equity feminism, difference feminism, conservative liberal feminism, and liberal socialist feminism. Some forms of modern liberal feminism have been described as neoliberal feminism or &quot;boardroom feminism&quot;. Liberal feminism is often closely associated with liberal internationalism. In many countries, particularly in the West but also in a number of secular states in the developing world, liberal feminism is associated with the concept of state feminism, and liberal feminism emphasizes constructive cooperation with the government and involvement in parliamentary and legislative processes to pursue reforms. Liberal feminism is also called &quot;mainstream feminism&quot;, &quot;reformist feminism&quot;, &quot;egalitarian feminism&quot;, or historically &quot;bourgeois feminism&quot; (or bourgeois-liberal feminism), among other names. As one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; schools of feminist thought, liberal feminism is often contrasted with socialist/Marxist feminism and radical feminism: unlike them, liberal feminism seeks gradual social progress and equality on the basis of liberal democracy rather than a revolution or radical reordering of society. Liberal feminism and mainstream feminism are very broad terms, frequently taken to encompass all feminism that is not radical or revolutionary socialist/Marxist and that instead pursues equality through political, legal, and social reform within a liberal democratic framework. As such, liberal feminists may subscribe to a range of different feminist beliefs and political ideologies within the democratic spectrum from the centre-left to the centre-right.

Inherently pragmatic in orientation, liberal feminists have emphasized building far-reaching support for feminist causes among both women and men, and among the political centre, the government and legislatures. In the 21st century, liberal feminism has taken a turn toward an intersectional understanding of gender equality, and modern liberal feminists support LGBT rights as a core feminist issue. Liberal feminists typically support laws and regulations that promote gender equality and ban practices that are discriminatory towards women; mainstream liberal feminists, particularly those of a social democratic bent, often support social measures to reduce material inequality within a liberal democratic framework. While rooted in first-wave feminism and traditionally focused on political and legal reform, the broader liberal feminist tradition may include parts of subsequent waves of feminism, especially third-wave feminism and fourth-wave feminism. The sunflower and the color gold, taken to represent enlightenment, became widely used symbols of mainstream liberal feminism and women&#x27;s suffrage from the 1860s, originally in the United States and later also in parts of Europe.

==Origins==
===Terminology===
The specific term &quot;liberal feminism&quot; is fairly modern, but its political tradition is much older. &quot;Feminism&quot; became the dominant term in English for the struggle for women&#x27;s rights in the late 20th century, around a century after the organized liberal women&#x27;s rights movement came into existence, but most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women&#x27;s rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves.

Historically, the bourgeois women&#x27;s rights movement—the predecessor of modern liberal feminism—was mainly contrasted with the working-class or &quot;proletarian&quot; women&#x27;s movements, which eventually developed into called socialist and Marxist feminism. Since the 1960s both liberal feminism and the &quot;proletarian&quot; or socialist/Marxist women&#x27;s movements are also contrasted with radical feminism. Liberal feminism is usually included as one of the two, three, or four main traditions in the history of feminism.

Many liberal feminists embraced the term &quot;feminism&quot; in the 1970s or 1980s, although some initially expressed scepticism towards the term; for example the liberal feminist Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights expressed scepticism towards the term &quot;feminism&quot; as late as 1980 because it could foster &quot;unnecessary antagonism towards men&quot;, but accepted the term some years later as it increasingly became the mainstream general term for the women&#x27;s rights struggle in the western world.

===Movement===

Liberal feminism ultimately has historical roots in classical liberalism and was often associated with social liberalism from the late 19th century. The goal for liberal feminists beginning in the late 18th century was to gain suffrage for women with the idea that this would allow them to gain individual liberty. They were concerned with gaining freedom through equality, diminishing men&#x27;s cruelty to women, and gaining opportunities to become full persons. They believed that no government or custom should prohibit the due exercise of personal freedom. Early liberal feminists had to counter the assumption that only white men deserved to be full citizens. Pioneers such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Judith Sargent Murray, and Frances Wright advocated for women&#x27;s full political inclusion. In 1920, after nearly 50 years of intense activism, women were finally granted the right to vote and the right to hold public office in the United States, and in much of the Western world within a few decades before or a few decades after this time.

Liberal feminism was largely quiet in the United States for four decades after winning the vote. In the 1960s during the civil rights movement, liberal feminists drew parallels between systemic race discrimination and sex discrimination. Groups such as the National Organization for Women, the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus, and the Women&#x27;s Equity Action League were all created at that time to further women&#x27;s rights. In the U.S., these groups have worked, thus far unsuccessfully, for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment or &quot;Constitutional Equity Amendment&quot;, in the hopes it will ensure that men and women are treated as equals under the law. Specific issues important to liberal feminists include but are not limited to reproductive rights and abortion access, sexual harassment, voting, education, fair compensation for work, affordable childcare, affordable health care, and bringing to light the frequency of sexual and domestic violence against women.

===Equal Rights Amendment===

A fair number of American liberal feminists believe that equality in pay, job opportunities, political structure, social security, and education for women especially needs to be guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

Three years after women won the right to vote, the Equal Right Amendment (ERA) was introduced in Congress by Senator Charles Curtis and Representative Daniel Read Anthony Jr., both Republicans. This amendment stated that civil rights cannot be denied on the basis of one&#x27;s sex. It was authored by Alice Paul, head of the National Women&#x27;s Party, who led the suffrage campaign. Through the efforts of Alice Paul, the Amendment was introduced into each session of the United States Congress, but it was buried in committee in both Houses of Congress. In 1946, it was narrowly defeated by the full Senate, 38–35. In February 1970, twenty NOW leaders disrupted the hearings of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, demanding the ERA be heard by the full Congress. In May of that year, the Senate Subcommittee began hearings on the ERA under Senator Birch Bayh. In June, the ERA finally left the House Judiciary Committee due to a discharge petition filed by Representative Martha Griffiths. In March 1972, the ERA was approved by the full Senate without changes, 84–8. Senator Sam Ervin and Representative Emanuel Celler succeeded in setting a time limit of seven years for ratification. The ERA then went to the individual states for approval but failed to win in enough of them (38) to become law. In 1978, Congress passed a disputed (less than supermajority) three-year extension on the original seven-year ratification limit, but the ERA could not gain approval by the needed number of states.

The state legislatures that were most hostile to the ERA were Utah, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. The NOW holds that the single most obvious problem in passing the ERA was the gender and racial imbalance in the legislatures. More than 2/3 of the women and all of the African Americans in state legislatures voted for the ERA, but less than 50% of the white men in the targeted legislatures cast pro-ERA votes in 1982.

==Philosophy==
===Equal rights===

According to Anthony Giddens, liberal feminist theory &quot;believes gender inequality is produced by reduced access for women and girls to civil rights and allocation of social resources such as education and employment.&quot; Catherine Rottenberg notes that the of classic liberal feminism was &quot;to pose an immanent critique of liberalism, revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracy’s proclamation of universal equality, particularly with respect to the law, institutional access, and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere.&quot; Rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern neoliberal feminism which &quot;seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order.&quot;

At its core, liberal feminism believes in pragmatic &quot;reforms against gender discrimination through the promotion of equal rights by engaging and formulating laws and policies that will ensure equality.&quot; Liberal feminists argue that society holds the false belief that women are, by nature, less intellectually and physically capable than men; thus it tends to discriminate against women in the academy, the forum, and the marketplace. Liberal feminists believe that &quot;female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women&#x27;s entrance to and success in the so-called public world&quot;, and strive for gender equality via political and legal reform. Cathrine Holst notes that &quot;the bourgeois women&#x27;s rights movement was liberal or liberal feminist. The bourgeois women&#x27;s rights advocates fought for women’s civil liberties and rights: freedom of speech, freedom of movement, the right to vote, freedom of association, inheritance rights, property rights, and freedom of trade – and for women&#x27;s access to education and working life. In short, women should have the same freedoms and rights as men.&quot;

Political liberalism gave feminism a familiar platform for convincing others that their reforms &quot;could and should be incorporated into existing law&quot;. Liberal feminists argued that women, like men, be regarded as autonomous individuals, and likewise be accorded the rights of such. Inherently pragmatic, liberal feminists tend to focus on practical reforms of laws and policies in order to achieve equality; liberal feminism has a more individualistic approach to justice than left-wing branches of feminism such as socialist or radical feminism. Susan Wendell argues that &quot;liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism, as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists, and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist ... reject major components of liberalism&quot; in a modern or party-political sense; she highlights &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; as a defining feature of liberal feminism. Helga Hernes notes that liberal feminism has often been critical of liberalist political positions and that liberal feminism and liberalism in general are not necessarily the same.

Lucy E. Bailey notes that liberal feminism is characterized by &quot;its focus on individual rights and reform through the state&quot; and that it has &quot;been instrumental in fueling women&#x27;s rights movements in diverse contexts and remains a familiar and widespread form of feminist thought. Liberal feminism emerged as a distinct political tradition during the Enlightenment (...) Liberal feminist theory emphasizes women&#x27;s individual rights to autonomy and proposes remedies for gender inequities through, variously, removing legal and social constraints or advancing conditions that support women&#x27;s equality.&quot;

===LGBT rights===

Liberal feminist organizations are broadly inclusive and thus tend to support LGBT rights in the modern era. For example, the two largest American feminist organizations, the liberal feminist National Organization for Women (NOW) and the League of Women Voters (LWV) both regard LGBT rights as a core feminist issue and vehemently support trans rights and oppose transphobia. NOW president Terry O&#x27;Neill said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue. NOW has affirmed that &quot;trans women are women, trans girls are girls.&quot; In a further statement NOW said that &quot;trans women are women. They deserve equal opportunity, health care, a safe community &amp; workplace, and they deserve to play sports. They have a right to have their identity respected without conforming to perceived sex and gender identity standards. We stand with you.&quot;

Similarly, the traditionally dominant liberal feminist international non-governmental organization, the International Alliance of Women (IAW) and its affiliates are trans-inclusive; IAW&#x27;s Icelandic affiliate, the Icelandic Women&#x27;s Rights Association, has stated that &quot;IWRA works for the rights of &quot;all&quot; women. Feminism without trans women is no feminism at all.&quot; On Women&#x27;s Rights Day in Iceland in 2020, the Icelandic Women&#x27;s Rights Association organised an event together with Trans Ísland that saw several different feminist organisations in the country discuss strategies to stop anti-trans sentiment from increasing its influence in Iceland. Later that year, Trans Ísland was unanimously granted status as a member association of the Icelandic Women&#x27;s Rights Association. In 2021 the International Alliance of Women and the Icelandic Women&#x27;s Rights Association organized an event on how the women&#x27;s movement could counter &quot;anti-trans voices [that] are becoming ever louder and [that] are threatening feminist solidarity across borders.&quot; The Danish Women&#x27;s Society supports LGBTQA rights, and has stated that it takes homophobia and transphobia very seriously, and that &quot;we support all initiatives that promote the rights of gay and transgender people.&quot; The Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights is trans-inclusive and supports legal protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The Deutscher Frauenring is intersectional and opposes transphobia. In November 2020, on Trans Day of Remembrance, the National Women&#x27;s Council of Ireland and Amnesty International Ireland co-signed a statement along with a number of LGBT+ and human rights groups condemning trans-exclusionary feminism. The letter called upon the media and politicians &quot;to no longer provide legitimate representation for those that share bigoted beliefs, that are aligned with far-right ideologies and seek nothing but harm and division&quot; and stated that &quot;these fringe internet accounts stand against affirmative medical care of transgender people, and they stand against the right to self-identification of transgender people in this country. In summation, they stand against trans, women’s, and gay rights by aligning themselves with far-right tropes and stances.&quot;

UN Women works to promote gender equality and the rights of women and LGBTIQ+ people, and &quot;urgently calls on communities and governments around the world to stand up for LGBTIQ+ rights.&quot; The Association for Women&#x27;s Rights in Development (AWID) supports LGBTIQ rights and opposes the anti-gender movement, and has described trans-exclusionary feminists as &quot;trojan horses in human rights spaces&quot; that seek to undermine human rights; AWID said that anti-trans activity is &quot;alarming,&quot; that &quot;the &#x27;sex-based&#x27; rhetoric misuses concepts of sex and gender to push a deeply discriminatory agenda&quot; and that &quot;trans-exclusionary feminists (...) undermine progressions on gender and sexuality and protection of rights of marginalized groups.&quot; To be clear, while there are debates, UN Women is said to be a liberal feminist organization. As evidence, although they seem to acknowledge intersectionality, UN Women still evaluate gender equality in each country by looking at how integrated women are into hegemonic society, for example they measure how many women are in a position of CEO and politician.

==Schools of thought==
Liberal feminism as a broad school of thought and main tradition in feminism includes many different varieties, such as equality feminism, social feminism, equity feminism, and difference feminism. State feminism is often linked to liberal feminism, particularly in Western countries. Some forms of modern liberal feminism have been described as neoliberal feminism.

===Neoliberal feminism===
Neoliberal feminism emerged in the 2010s. In &quot;The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism&quot;, Rottenberg defines neoliberalism as a “new form of selfhood, which encourages people as individual subjects responsible for their own well-being” as well as it ensures the individual right to their own autonomous decision making (p. 421). The author argues that neoliberal feminism emerged from neoliberalism being espoused by “increasingly high-powered women”, for example Anne-Marie Slaughter and Sheryl Sandberg (p. 418). Even though Sandberg states in &quot;Lean In&quot; that she “supports who want to eliminate external barriers” so that every woman can lean in, she argues that as the first step, women should lean in so as to reform society (p. 3). Therefore, women who are worried about the possibility of having a child at the cost of her career should not “lean back” but keep leaning in (p. 51). Sandberg does not seek reformation of social system, which she even calls “the rat race” (p. 51). Neoliberal feminists apparently realize the gender inequality. However, they value women who accept the responsibility for taking balance between work and family following the theory of neoliberalism, in which they do not accuse the state but take care of their own well-being. As a political reason for emergence of neoliberal feminism, Rottenberg asserts that by “responsiblizing” women, neoliberalism feminism is useful for diffusing social issues (i.e., sexism, racism, capitalism).

===Libertarian feminism===
Individualist or libertarian feminism is sometimes grouped as one of many branches of feminism with historical roots in liberal feminism but tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism on many issues. For example, &quot;libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality; in fact, it opposes such measures ... in contrast, liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them.&quot; Libertarian feminists tend to focus more on sexual politics, a topic traditionally of less concern to liberal feminists. Mainstream liberal feminists, such as the National Organization for Women, tend to oppose prostitution, but are somewhat divided on prostitution politics, unlike both libertarian and radical feminists.

===Western feminism===
Liberal feminist organizations such as the International Alliance of Women tend to be supportive of liberal democratic states&#x27; foreign and security policy, and maintained a clear pro-Western stance throughout the Cold War. From the second half of the 20th century women in development has increasingly become an important topic for liberal feminist organizations.

Hillary Clinton is often considered a liberal feminist, and has defined &quot;feminist&quot; in accordance with the liberal feminist definition as &quot;someone who believes in equal rights.&quot; Some articles do not clearly describe her as a liberal feminist, yet argue that Clinton&#x27;s policy and her white privilege ignore many women, for instance women of color, low-income women, and immigrants while NOW (2015) admire her as “a trailblazer for women with an impressive record of public service where she put women’s rights at the forefront”.

=== Equity feminism ===

Equity feminism is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s, specifically a kind of classically liberal or libertarian feminism, emphasizing equality under law, equal freedoms, and rights, rather than profound social transformations.

The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; refers to Wendy McElroy, Joan Kennedy Taylor, Cathy Young, Rita Simon, Katie Roiphe, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Christine Stolba, and Christina Hoff Sommers as equity feminists. Steven Pinker, an evolutionary psychologist, identifies himself as an equity feminist, which he defines as &quot;a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology&quot;. Barry Kuhle asserts that equity feminism is compatible with evolutionary psychology, in contrast to gender feminism.

==Writers==
Feminist writers associated with this theory include Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Helen Taylor, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Gina Krog; Second Wave feminists Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Simone de Beauvoir; and Third Wave feminist Rebecca Walker.

=== Mary Wollstonecraft ===
Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) has been very influential in her writings as &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; commented on society&#x27;s view of women and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft &quot;denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood.&quot; She argued that patriarchal oppression is a form of slavery that could no longer be ignored . Wollstonecraft argued that the inequality between men and women existed due to the disparity between their educations. Along with Judith Sargent Murray and Frances Wright, Wollstonecraft was one of the first major advocates for women&#x27;s full inclusion in politics.

=== Elizabeth Cady Stanton ===
Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902) was one of the most influential women in first wave feminism. An American social activist, she was instrumental in orchestrating the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention, which was held in Seneca Falls, New York. Not only was the suffragist movement important to Stanton, she also was involved in women&#x27;s parental and custody rights, divorce laws, birth control, employment and financial rights, among other issues. Her partner in this movement was the equally influential Susan B. Anthony. Together, they fought for a linguistic shift in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to include &quot;female&quot;. Additionally, in 1890 she founded the National American Woman Suffrage Association and presided as president until 1892. She produced many speeches, resolutions, letters, calls, and petitions that fed the first wave and kept the spirit alive. Furthermore, by gathering a large number of signatures, she aided the passage of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act of 1848 which considered women legally independent of their husbands and granted the property of their own. Together these women formed what was known as the NWSA (National Women Suffrage Association), which focused on working with legislatures and the courts to gain suffrage.

=== John Stuart Mill ===
John Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 – 7 May 1873) believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that &quot;until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely.&quot; Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same &quot;genuine unselfishness&quot; that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one &quot;that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit&quot;. Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, Mill argues that three major parts of women&#x27;s lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education, and marriage. He also argues that sex inequality is greatly inhibiting the progress of humanity.

=== Betty Friedan ===
Betty Friedan (1921–2006) was a liberal feminist prominent in the 1960s. She was a co-founder and the first president of NOW, and contributed to the second wave feminism. Her book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, written in 1963, became a landmark bestseller and significantly influential by rebuking the fulfillment of middle-class women for domestic lives. In her book, Friedan reversed the discourse of American housewife as ideal and happy and pointed out dissatisfaction and loneliness which were faced by many American women in the 1950s and 1960s. She described these women&#x27;s experience as a problem without name and called for financial independence of women for liberation. Many articles argue that Friedan was unaware of her white privilege and failed to realize intersectionality of women. For example, by stating that &quot;only economic independence can free a woman to marry for love&quot;, Friedan attempted to encourage every woman not to &quot;be afraid of flying&quot; and seek their own lives outside of household. She also argued the necessity of a social and political women&#x27;s movement by raising the black civil rights movement as a model. However, she did not try to combine those movements together, nor was black women&#x27;s experience considered in feminist context. Instead, she presumed the separation of issues of race and sex.

==Organizations==

===National Organization for Women===
The National Organization for Women (NOW) is the largest liberal feminist organization in the United States. It supports the Equal Rights Amendment, reproductive rights including freer access to abortion, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights (LGBT rights), and economic justice. It opposes violence against women and racism.

===National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus===
The National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus (NWPC), founded in 1971, is the only national organization in the U.S. dedicated exclusively to increasing women&#x27;s participation in all areas of political and public life as elected and appointed officials, as delegates to national party conventions, as judges in the state and federal courts, and as lobbyists, voters and campaign organizers.

Founders of NWPC include such prominent women as Gloria Steinem, author, lecturer and founding editor of Ms. Magazine; former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; former Congresswoman Bella Abzug; Dorothy Height, former president of the National Council of Negro Women; Jill Ruckelshaus, former U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner; Ann Lewis, former Political Director of the Democratic National Committee; Elly Peterson, former vice-chair of the Republican National Committee; LaDonna Harris, Indian rights leader; Liz Carpenter, author, lecturer and former press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson; and Eleanor Holmes Norton, Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives and former chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

These women were spurred by Congress&#x27; failure to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in 1970. They believed legal, economic and social equity would come about only when women were equally represented among the nation&#x27;s political decision-makers. Their faith that women&#x27;s interests would best be served by women lawmakers has been confirmed time and time again, as women in Congress, state legislatures and city halls across the country have introduced, fought for and won legislation to eliminate sex discrimination and meet women&#x27;s changing needs.

===Women&#x27;s Equity Action League===
The Women&#x27;s Equity Action League (WEAL) was a national membership organization, with state chapters and divisions, founded in 1968 and dedicated to improving the status and lives of women primarily through education, litigation, and legislation. It was a more conservative organization than NOW and was formed largely by former members of that organization who did not share the NOW&#x27;s assertive stance on socio-sexual issues, particularly on abortion rights. WEAL spawned a sister organization, the Women&#x27;s Equity Action League Fund, which was incorporated in 1972 &quot;to help secure legal rights for women and to carry on educational and research projects on sex discrimination&quot;. The two organizations merged in 1981 following changes in the tax code. WEAL dissolved in 1989.

The stated purposes of WEAL were:
*to promote greater economic progress on the part of American women;
*to press for full enforcement of existing anti-discriminatory laws on behalf of women;
*to seek correction of de facto discrimination against women;
*to gather and disseminate information and educational material;
*to investigate instances of, and seek solutions to, economic, educational, tax, and employment problems affecting women;
*to urge that girls be prepared to enter more advanced career fields;
*to seek reappraisal of federal, state, and local laws and practices limiting women&#x27;s employment opportunities;
*to combat by all lawful means, job discrimination against women in the pay, promotional or advancement policies of governmental or private employers;
*to seek the cooperation and coordination of all American women, individually or as organizations *to attain these objectives, whether through legislation, litigation, or other means and by doing any and all things necessary or incident thereto.

===Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights===
Norway has had a tradition of government-supported liberal feminism since 1884, when the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights (NKF) was founded with the support of the progressive establishment within the then-dominant governing Liberal Party (which received 63.4% of the votes in the election the following year). The association&#x27;s founders included five Norwegian prime ministers, and several of its early leaders were married to prime ministers. Rooted in first-wave liberal feminism, it works &quot;to promote gender equality and women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; human rights within the framework of liberal democracy and through political and legal reform&quot;. NKF members had key roles in developing the government apparatus and legislation related to gender equality in Norway since 1884; with the professionalization of gender equality advocacy from 1970s, the &quot;Norwegian government adopted NKF&#x27;s [equality] ideology as its own&quot; and adopted laws and established government institutions such as the Gender Equality Ombud based on NKF&#x27;s proposals; the new government institutions to promote gender equality were also largely built and led by prominent NKF members such as Eva Kolstad, NKF&#x27;s former president and the first Gender Equality Ombud. NKF&#x27;s feminist tradition has often been described as Norway&#x27;s state feminism. The term state feminism itself was coined by NKF member Helga Hernes. Although it grew out of 19th-century progressive liberalism, Norwegian liberal feminism is not limited to liberalism in a modern party-political sense, and NKF is broadly representative of the democratic political spectrum from the center-left to the center-right, including the social democratic Labour Party. Norwegian supreme court justice and former NKF President Karin Maria Bruzelius has described NKF&#x27;s liberal feminism as &quot;a realistic, sober, practical feminism&quot;.

*Icelandic Women&#x27;s Rights Association

==Symbolism==

The sunflower (and sometimes by analogy the Sun) and the color yellow/gold (Or in heraldry), taken to represent enlightenment, became widely used symbols of the mainstream liberal women&#x27;s rights movement and women&#x27;s suffrage from the 1860s, originally in the United States and later also in parts of Europe. The suffragists and liberal feminists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony encouraged the use of the sunflower by wearing sunflower pins when campaigning for the right to vote in 1867 in Kansas. Hence the colors yellow and white became the main colors of the international liberal (also called mainstream or bourgeois) suffrage movement around the turn of the century, notably used by the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. Historians Cheris Kramarae and Paula A. Treichler noted that

The sunflower and/or the color yellow/gold remain in use among the older liberal (bourgeois) feminist organizations such as the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights and the International Alliance of Women that were founded during the struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage.

The color yellow is also widely used as a symbol of liberalism in general.

== Criticism ==
=== Gender roles ===
Critics of liberal feminism argue that its individualist assumptions make it difficult to see the ways in which underlying social structures and values disadvantage women. They argue that even if women are not dependent upon individual men, they are still dependent upon a patriarchal state. These critics believe that institutional changes, like the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage, are insufficient to emancipate women.

According to Zhang and Rios, &quot;liberal feminism tends to be adopted by &#x27;mainstream&#x27; (i.e., middle-class) women who do not disagree with the current social structure.&quot; They found that liberal feminist beliefs were viewed as the dominant and &quot;default&quot; form of feminism.

One of the more prevalent critiques of liberal feminism is that it, as a study, allows too much of its focus to fall on a &quot;metamorphosis&quot; of women into men, and in doing so, it disregards the significance of the traditional role of women. One of the leading scholars who have critiqued liberal feminism is radical feminist Catherine A. MacKinnon, an American lawyer, writer, and social activist. Specializing in issues regarding sex equality, she has been intimately involved in cases regarding the definition of sexual harassment and sex discrimination. She, among other radical feminist scholars, views liberalism and feminism as incompatible, because liberalism offers women a &quot;piece of the pie as currently and poisonously baked&quot;.

=== Racial attitudes ===
bell hooks&#x27; main criticism of the philosophies of liberal feminism is that they focus too much on an equality with men in their own class. She maintains that the &quot;cultural basis of group oppression&quot; is the biggest challenge, in that liberal feminists tend to ignore it.

Another important critique of liberal feminism posits the existence of a &quot;white woman&#x27;s burden&quot; or white savior complex. The phrase &quot;white woman&#x27;s burden&quot; derives from &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;. Critics such as Black feminists and postcolonial feminists assert that mainstream liberal feminism reflects only the values of middle-class, heterosexual, white women and fails to appreciate the position of women of different races, cultures, or classes. With this, white liberal feminists reflect the issues that underlie the white savior complex. They do not understand women that are outside the dominant society but try to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;help&quot; them by pushing them to assimilate into their ideals of feminism. According to such critics, liberal feminism fails to recognize the power dynamics that are in play with women of color and transnational women which involve multiple sources of oppression.

<text>The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), also known as the Indian bear, is a myrmecophagous bear species native to the Indian subcontinent. It feeds on fruits, ants and termites. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, mainly because of habitat loss and degradation. It is the only species in the genus Melursus.

It has also been called &quot;labiated bear&quot; because of its long lower lip and palate used for sucking up insects. It has long, shaggy fur, a mane around the face, and long, sickle-shaped claws. It is lankier than brown and Asian black bears.
It shares features of insectivorous mammals and evolved during the Pleistocene from the ancestral brown bear through divergent evolution.

Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near the beginning of winter. When their territories are encroached upon by humans, they sometimes attack them. Historically, humans have drastically reduced these bears&#x27; habitat and diminished their population by hunting them for food and products such as their bacula and claws. Sloth bears have been tamed and used as performing animals and as pets.

== Taxonomy ==
George Shaw in 1791 named the species &quot;Bradypus ursinus&quot;. In 1793, Meyer named it &quot;Melursus lybius&quot;, and in 1817, de Blainville named it &quot;Ursus labiatus&quot; because of its long lips. Illiger named it &quot;Prochilus hirsutus&quot;, the Greek genus name indicating long lips, while the specific name noted its long and coarse hair. Fischer called it &quot;Chondrorhynchus hirsutus&quot;, while Tiedemann named it &quot;Ursus longirostris&quot;.

=== Subspecies and range ===
== Evolution ==
Sloth bears may have reached their current form in the Early Pleistocene, the time when the bear family specialised and dispersed. A fragment of fossilised humerus from the Pleistocene, found in Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s Kurnool Basin is identical to the humerus of a modern sloth bear. The fossilised skulls of a bear once named &quot;Melursus theobaldi&quot; found in the Shivaliks from the Early Pleistocene or Early Pliocene are thought by certain authors to represent an intermediate stage between sloth bears and ancestral brown bears. &quot;M. theobaldi&quot; itself had teeth intermediate in size between sloth bears and other bear species, though its palate was the same size as the former species, leading to the theory that it is the sloth bear&#x27;s direct ancestor. Sloth bears probably arose during the Middle Pliocene and evolved in the Indian subcontinent. The sloth bear shows evidence of having undergone a convergent evolution similar to that of other ant-eating mammals.

The sloth bear is one of eight extant species in the bear family Ursidae and of six extant species in the subfamily Ursinae. 

== Characteristics ==
Sloth bears adults are medium-sized bears. The typical weight range for females is from , and for males is from . Exceptionally large female specimens can reach and males up to . The average weight of sloth bears from the nominate subspecies in Nepal was in females and in males. Nominate bears in India were found to weigh average in males and in female per one study. Specimens from Sri Lanka (&quot;M. u. inornatus&quot;) may weigh up to in females and in males. However six Sri Lankan male sloth bears averaged only , and was the average for four females, so Sri Lankan bears could be around 30% lighter in body mass than nominate race bears and with more pronounced size sexual dimorphism. They are high at the shoulder, and have a body length of . Besides being smaller than males, females reportedly typically have more fur between their shoulders.

Sloth bear muzzles are thick and long, with small jaws and bulbous snouts with wide nostrils. They have long lower lips which can be stretched over the outer edge of their noses, and they lack upper incisors, thus allowing them to suck up large numbers of insects. The premolars and molars are smaller than in other bears, as they do not chew as much vegetation. In adults, the teeth are usually in poor condition, due to the amount of soil they suck up and chew when feeding on insects. The back of the palate is long and broad, as is typical in other ant-eating mammals. The paws are disproportionately large, and have highly developed, sickle-shaped, blunt claws which measure in length. Their toe pads are connected by a hairless web. They have the longest tail in the bear family, which can grow to . Their back legs are not very strong, though they are knee-jointed, and allow them to assume almost any position. The ears are very large and floppy. The sloth bear is the only bear with long hair on its ears.

Sloth bear fur is completely black (rusty for some specimens), save for a whitish Y- or V-shaped mark on the chest. This feature is sometimes absent, particularly in Sri Lankan specimens. This feature, which is also present in Asian black bears and sun bears, is thought to serve as a threat display, as all three species are sympatric with tigers (tigers usually do not carry out attacks on an adult bear if the bear is aware or facing the cat). The coat is long, shaggy, and unkempt, despite the relatively warm environment in which the species is found, and is particularly heavy behind the neck and between the shoulders, forming a mane which can be long. The belly and underlegs can be almost bare. Sloth bears are usually about the same size as an Asian black bear but are immediately distinctive for their shaggier coat, whitish claws, as well as their typically rangier build. Their head and mouth is highly distinct from that of a black bear with a longer, narrower skull shape (particularly the snout), loose-looking, flappier lips and paler muzzle colour. In few areas of overlap, sloth bear confusion with sun bears is unlikely, given the latter species considerably smaller size, much shorter fur, wrinkled folding skin (especially around the back), bolder chest marking and drastically different, more compact head structure and appearance.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The sloth bear&#x27;s global range includes India, the Terai of Nepal, temperate climatic zones of Bhutan and Sri Lanka. It occurs in a wide range of habitats including moist and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands and grasslands below on the Indian subcontinent, and below in Sri Lanka&#x27;s dry forests. It is regionally extinct in Bangladesh.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Adult sloth bears may travel in pairs. Males are often observed to be gentle with cubs. They may fight for food. They walk in a slow, shambling motion, with their feet being set down in a noisy, flapping motion. They are capable of galloping faster than running humans. Although they appear slow and clumsy, both young and adult sloth bears are excellent climbers. They occasionally will climb to feed and to rest, though not to escape enemies, as they prefer to stand their ground. Sloth bear mothers carry their cubs up trees as the primary defense against attacks by predators instead of sending them up trees. The cubs can be threatened by predators such as tigers, leopards, and other bears. They are adequate climbers on more accessible trees but cannot climb as quickly or on as varied surfaces as can black bears due to the sloth species&#x27; more elongated claw structure. Given their smaller size and still shorter claws, sloth bear cubs probably climb more proficiently than adults (much as brown bear cubs can climb well but not adults). They are good swimmers, and primarily enter water to play.

To mark their territories, sloth bears scrape trees with their forepaws, and rub against them with their flanks. Sloth bears are recorded to produce several sounds and vocals. Howls, squeals, screams, barks and trumpet-like calls are made during aggressive encounters while huffing is made as a warning signal. Chuffing calls are made when disturbed. Females keep in contact with their cubs with a grunt-whicker while cubs yelp when separated.

=== Reproduction ===
The breeding season for sloth bears varies according to location: in India, they mate in April, May, and June, and give birth in December and early January, while in Sri Lanka, it occurs all year. Sows gestate for 210 days, and typically give birth in caves or in shelters under boulders. Litters usually consist of one or two cubs, or rarely three. Cubs are born blind, and open their eyes after four weeks. Sloth bear cubs develop quickly compared to most other bear species: they start walking a month after birth, become independent at 24–36 months, and become sexually mature at the age of three years. Young cubs ride on their mother&#x27;s back when she walks, runs, or climbs trees until they reach a third of her size. Individual riding positions are maintained by cubs through fighting. Intervals between litters can last two to three years.

=== Dietary habits ===
Sloth bears are expert hunters of termites, ants, and bees, which they locate by smell. On arriving at a mound, they scrape at the structure with their claws until they reach the large combs at the bottom of the galleries, and disperse the soil with violent puffs. The termites are then sucked up through the muzzle, producing a sucking sound which can be heard 180 m away. Their sense of smell is strong enough to detect grubs 3 ft below ground. Unlike other bears, they do not congregate in feeding groups. Sloth bears may supplement their diets with fruit, plant matter, carrion, and very rarely other mammals. In March and April, they eat the fallen petals of mowha trees and are partial to mangoes, maize, sugar cane, jackfruit, and the pods of the golden shower tree. Sloth bears are extremely fond of honey. When feeding their cubs, sows are reported to regurgitate a mixture of half-digested jack fruit, wood apples, and pieces of honeycomb. This sticky substance hardens into a dark yellow, circular, bread-like mass which is fed to the cubs. This &quot;bear&#x27;s bread&quot; is considered a delicacy by some of India&#x27;s natives. Rarely, Sloth bears can become addicted to sweets in hotel waste, visiting rubbish bins, even inside populated towns, all year long. Their diet includes animal flesh.

In Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala, seeds of six tree species eaten and excreted by sloth bears (&quot;Artocarpus hirsuta&quot;, &quot;A. integrifolia&quot;, &quot;Cassia fistula&quot;, &quot;Mangifera indica&quot;, &quot;Zizyphus oenoplina&quot;) did not see significantly different percentages of germination (appearance of cotyledon) when compared to germinated seeds that had not been passed through the gut of the bears. However, seeds germinated much faster after being ingested by bears for three species, &quot;Artocarpus hirsuta, Cassia fistula,&quot; and &quot;Zizyphus oenoplina&quot;. This experiment suggests that sloth bears may play an important role in seed dispersal and germination, with effects varying by tree species.

=== Relationships with other animals ===
The large canine teeth of sloth bears, relative to both its overall body size and to the size of the canine teeth of other bear species, and the aggressive disposition of sloth bears, may be a defense in interactions with large, dangerous animals, such as the tiger, elephant, and rhinoceros, as well as prehistoric species such as Megantereon.

Bengal tigers occasionally prey on sloth bears. Tigers usually give sloth bears a wide berth, though some specimens may become habitual bear killers, and it is not uncommon to find sloth bear fur in tiger scats. Tigers typically hunt sloth bears by waiting for them near termite mounds, then creeping behind them and seizing them by the back of their necks and forcing them to the ground with their weight. One tiger was reported to simply break its victim&#x27;s back with its paw, then wait for the paralysed bear to exhaust itself trying to escape before going in for the kill. When confronted by tigers face to face, sloth bears charge at them, crying loudly. A young or already sated tiger usually retreats from an assertive sloth bear, as the bear&#x27;s claws can inflict serious wounds, and most tigers end the hunt if the bears become aware of the tiger&#x27;s presence before the pounce. Sloth bears may scavenge on tiger kills. As tigers are known to mimic the calls of sambar deer to attract them, sloth bears react fearfully even to the sounds made by deer themselves. In 2011, a female bear with cubs was observed to stand her ground and prevail in a confrontation against two tigers (one female, one male) in rapid succession.

Besides tigers there are few predators of sloth bears. Leopards can also be a threat, as they are able to follow sloth bears up trees. Bear cubs are probably far more vulnerable and healthy adult bears may be avoided by leopards. One leopard killed a three-quarters grown female sloth bear in an apparently lengthy fight that culminated in the trees. Apparently, a sloth bear killed a leopard in a confrontation in Yala National Park, Sri Lanka, but was itself badly injured in the fight and was subsequently put down by park rangers. Sloth bears occasionally chase leopards from their kills. Dhole packs may attack sloth bears. When attacking them, dholes try to prevent the bear from retreating into caves. Unlike tigers which prey on sloth bears of all size, there is little evidence that dholes are a threat to fully-grown sloth bears other than exceptionally rare cases. In one case, a golden jackal (a species much smaller and less powerful than a sloth bear and not generally a pack hunter as is the dhole) was seen to aggressively displace an adult bear which passively loped away from the snapping canid, indicating the sloth bear does not regard other carnivores as competition.

Sloth bears are sympatric with Asiatic black bears in northern India, and the two species, along with the sun bear, coexist in some of the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. They are also found together in Assam, Manipur, and Mizoram, in the hills south of the Brahmaputra River, the only places occupied by all three bear species. The three species do not act aggressively toward each other. This may be because the three species generally differ in habit and dietary preferences.

Asian elephants apparently do not tolerate sloth bears in their vicinity. The reason for this is unknown, as individual elephants known to maintain their composure near tigers have been reported to charge bears. The Indian rhinoceros has a similar intolerance for sloth bears, and will charge at them.

== Status and conservation ==
The sloth bear is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which provides for its legal protection. Commercial international trade of the sloth bear, including 
parts and derivatives, is prohibited as it is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Fewer than 20,000 sloth bears are estimated to survive in the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. To address the human-bear conflict, people may be educated about the conservation ethics, particularly among locals. To resolve this conflict, the basic issue of deteriorating habitat, which is the reason for the conflict between people and bears, improvements through government or community-based reforestation programmes, may be promoted.
Sloth bears have also been found dead in traps, electrocuted, or killed by other means by poachers, with body parts (i.e. canines, claws, gall bladder, paws, etc) usually removed for the illegal wildlife trade.
The population of sloth bears grows when they live in high-profile reserves that protect species, such as tigers and elephants. Directly managed reserves could conserve the sloth bear, hence such reserves must be supported. Managing garbage, especially hotel waste with foods, is essential in situations where sloth bears get used to entering towns with an increase in the number of accidental attacks on humans.

The government of India has banned use of sloth bears for entertainment, and a &#x27;Sloth Bear Welfare Project&#x27; in the country has the objective of putting an end to their use for entertainment. However, their number in such activity is still large. Many organisations are helping in the conservation and preservation of sloth bears in safe places. Sloth bears previously used for entertainment are being rehabilitated in facilities like Agra Bear Rescue Facility run by Wildlife SOS and others. Major sloth bear sanctuaries in India include the Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary in Karnataka, and Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary in Gujarat. A Sloth Bear Conservation Reserve is proposed in Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh.

== Relationships with humans ==

=== Attacks on humans ===

Sloth bears are one of the most aggressive extant bears and, due to large human populations often closely surrounding reserves that hold bears, aggressive encounters and attacks are relatively frequent, though in some places, attacks appear to be a reaction to encountering people accidentally. In absolute numbers, this is the species of bear that most regularly attacks humans. Only the Himalayan black bear subspecies of Asian black bear is nearly as dangerous. Sloth bears likely view humans as potential predators, as their reactions to them (roaring, followed by retreat or charging) are similar to those evoked in the presence of tigers and leopards. Their long claws, which are ideally adapted for digging at termite mounds, make adults less capable of climbing trees to escape danger, as are other bears such as Asian black bears. Therefore, sloth bears have seemingly evolved to deal with threats by behaving aggressively. For the same reason, brown bears can be similarly inclined, accounting for the relatively high incidence of seemingly non-predatory aggression towards humans in these two bear species.

According to Robert Armitage Sterndale, in his &quot;Mammalia of India&quot; (1884, p. 62):

Captain Williamson in his &quot;Oriental Field Sports&quot; wrote of how sloth bears rarely killed their human victims outright, but would suck and chew on their limbs till they were reduced to bloody pulps. One specimen, known as the sloth bear of Mysore, was responsible for the deaths of 12 people and the mutilation of 24 others. It was shot by Kenneth Anderson. Although sloth bears have attacked humans, they rarely become man-eaters. Dunbar-Brander&#x27;s &quot;Wild Animals of Central India&quot; mentions a case in which a sow with two cubs began a six-week reign of terror in Chanda, a district of the Central Provinces, during which more than one of their victims had been eaten, while the sloth bear of Mysore partially ate at least three of its victims. R.G. Burton deduced from comparing statistics that sloth bears killed more people than Asian black bears, and Theodore Roosevelt considered them to be more dangerous than American black bears. Unlike some other bear species, which at times make mock charges at humans when surprised or frightened without making physical contact, sloth bears frequently appear to initiate a physical attack almost immediately. When people living near an aggressive population of sloth bears were armed with rifles, it was found that it was an ineffective form of defense, since the bear apparently charges and knocks the victim back (often knocking the rifle away) before the human has the chance to defend themself. In Madhya Pradesh, sloth bear attacks accounted for the deaths of 48 people and the injuring of 686 others between 1989 and 1994, probably due in part to the density of population and competition for food sources. A total of 137 attacks (resulting in 11 deaths) occurred between April 1998 and December 2000 in the North Bilaspur Forest Division of Chhattisgarh. The majority of attacks were perpetrated by single bears, and occurred in kitchen gardens, crop fields, and in adjoining forests during the monsoon season. One Mr. Watts Jones wrote a first-hand account of how it feels to be attacked by a sloth bear, recalling when he failed to score a direct hit against a bear he had targeted:

In 2016, according to a forest official, a female bear had killed three people, and hurt five others in Gujarat State&#x27;s Banaskantha district, near Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary, with some of the casualties being colleagues. At first, an attempt was made to trace and cage it, but this failed, costing the life of one official, and so a team of both officials and policemen shot the bear.

In Karnataka&#x27;s Bellary district, most of the attacks by sloth bears occurred outside forests, when they entered settlements and farmlands in search of food and water.

In Mount Abu town in southern Rajasthan, sloth bears attacked people inside towns where they were seeking hotel waste in rubbish bins and encountered people by chance. Though such attacks were concomitant with increasing tourism activity, quite remarkably, local residents have not retaliated against the sloth bears. The absence of retaliation in many locations of India appears related to cultural norms and the dominant religion Hinduism where nature and animals are worshipped as deities.

=== Hunting and products ===

One method of hunting sloth bears involved the use of beaters, in which case, a hunter waiting on a post could either shoot the approaching bear through the shoulder or on the white chest mark if it was moving directly to him. Sloth bears are very resistant to body shots, and can charge hunters if wounded, though someone of steady nerves could score a direct hit from within a few paces of a charging bear. Sloth bears were easy to track during the wet season, as their clear footprints could be followed straight to their lairs. The majority of sloth bears killed in forests were due to chance encounters with them during hunts for other game. In hilly or mountainous regions, two methods were used to hunt them there. One was to lie in wait above the bear&#x27;s lair at dawn and wait for the bear to return from its nocturnal foraging. Another was to rouse them at daytime by firing flares into the cave to draw them out. Sloth bears were also occasionally speared on horseback. In Sri Lanka, the baculum of a sloth bear was once used as a charm against barrenness.

=== Tameability ===

Officers in British India often kept sloth bears as pets. The wife of Kenneth Anderson kept an orphaned sloth bear cub from Mysore, which she named &quot;Bruno&quot;. The bear was fed all sorts of things and was very affectionate toward people. It was even taught numerous tricks, such as cradling a woodblock like a baby or pointing a bamboo stick like a gun.

Dancing bears were historically a popular entertainment in India, dating back to the 13th century and the pre-Mughal era. The Kalandars, who practised the tradition of capturing sloth bears for entertainment purposes, were often employed in the courts of Mughal emperors to stage spectacles involving trained bears. They were once common in the towns of Calcutta, where they often disturbed the horses of British officers.

Despite a ban on the practice that was enacted in 1972, as many as 800 dancing bears were in the streets of India during the latter part of the 20th century, particularly on the highway between Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. Sloth bear cubs, which were usually purchased at the age of six months from traders and poachers, were trained to dance and follow commands through coercive stimuli and starvation. Males were castrated at an early age, and their teeth were knocked out at the age of one year to prevent them from seriously injuring their handlers. The bears were typically fitted with a nose ring attached to a four-foot leash. Some were found to be blind from malnutrition.

In 2009, following a seven-year campaign by a coalition of Indian and international animal welfare groups, the last Kalandar dancing bear was set free. The effort to end the practice involved helping the bear handlers find jobs and education, which enabled them to reduce their reliance on dancing-bear income.

== Cultural references ==

Charles Catton included the bear in his 1788 book &quot;Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta&quot;, describing it as an &quot;animal of the bear-kind&quot; and saying it was properly called the &quot;Petre Bear&quot;.

In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo &quot;the sleepy old brown bear&quot; teaches the Law of the Jungle to the wolf cubs of the Seeonee wolf pack, as well as to his most challenging pupil, the &quot;man-cub&quot; Mowgli. Robert Armitage Sterndale, from whom Kipling derived most of his knowledge of Indian fauna, used the Hindustani word &quot;bhalu&quot; for several bear species, though Daniel Karlin, who edited the Penguin Classics reissue of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; in 1989, stated, with the exception of colour, Kipling&#x27;s descriptions of Baloo are consistent with the sloth bear, as brown bears and Asian black bears do not occur in the Seoni area where the novel takes place. Also, the name &quot;sloth&quot; can be used in the context of sleepiness. Karlin states, however, that Baloo&#x27;s diet of &quot;.. only roots and nuts and honey&quot; is a trait more common to the Asian black bear than to the sloth bear.

<text>The blue rock thrush (Monticola solitarius) is a species of chat. This thrush-like Old World flycatcher was formerly placed in the family Turdidae. It breeds in southern Europe, northwest Africa, and from Central Asia to northern China and Malaysia. The blue rock thrush is the official national bird of Malta (the word for it in Maltese being &quot;Merill&quot;) and was shown on the Lm 1 coins that were part of the country&#x27;s former currency.

==Taxonomy==
The blue rock thrush was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Turdus solitarius&quot;. The scientific name is from Latin. &quot;Monticola&quot; is from &quot;mons, montis&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;, and &quot;colere&quot;, &quot;to dwell&quot;, and the specific epithet &quot;solitarius&quot; means &quot;solitary&quot;.

The rock thrush genus Monticola was formerly placed in the family Turdidae but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in the genus are more closely related to members of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.

There are five recognised subspecies:

* &quot;M. s. solitarius&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – northwest Africa, south Europe, north Turkey to Georgia and Azerbaijan.
* &quot;M. s. longirostris&quot; (Blyth, 1847) – Greece and west and south Turkey through the Middle East to the northwest Himalayas to northeast Africa and India
* &quot;M. s. pandoo&quot; (Sykes, 1832) – central Himalayas to east China and north Vietnam to Greater Sunda Islands
* &quot;M. s. philippensis&quot; (Statius Müller, 1776) – east Mongolia to Sakhalin south to Japan, extreme north Philippines and northeast China to Indonesia
* &quot;M. s. madoci&quot; Chasen, 1940 – Malay Peninsula and north Sumatra

There is a proposal to split &quot;Monticola solitarius&quot; into two species: a western taxon comprising &quot;M. s. solitarius&quot; and &quot;M. s. longirostris&quot; and an eastern taxon with &quot;M. s. philippensis&quot;, &quot;M. s. pandoo&quot; and &quot;M. s. madoci&quot;.

==Description==
The blue rock thrush is a starling-sized bird, in length with a long slim bill. The breeding male of the nominate subspecies is unmistakable, with all blue-grey plumage apart from its darker wings. Females and immatures are much less striking, with dark brown upperparts, and paler brown scaly underparts. The male of the subspecies &quot;M. s. philippensis&quot; has rufous-chestnut plumage from the mid-breast down to the undertail. Both sexes lack the reddish outer tail feathers of rock thrush.

The male blue rock thrush sings a clear, melodious call that is similar to, but louder than, the call of the rock thrush.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European, north African and southeast Asian birds are mainly resident, apart from altitudinal movements. Other Asian populations are more migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, India and southeast Asia. This bird is a very uncommon visitor to northern and western Europe. It is known to have been spotted in North America twice: once in British Columbia in 1997 and once in Oregon in 2024.

==Behaviour==
Blue rock thrush breeds in open mountainous areas. It nests in rock cavities and walls, and usually lays 3-5 eggs. An omnivore, the blue rock thrush eats a wide variety of insects and small reptiles in addition to berries and seeds.

<doc id="399747" wikidata="Q483992" url="?curid=399747" title="William-Adolphe Bouguereau">
<text>William-Adolphe Bouguereau (; 30 November 1825 – 19 August 1905) was a French academic painter. In his realistic genre paintings, he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life, he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. He finished 822 known paintings, but the whereabouts of many are still unknown.

==Life and career==

===Formative years===

William-Adolphe Bouguereau was born in La Rochelle, France, on 30 November 1825, into a family of wine and olive oil merchants. The son of Théodore Bouguereau (born 1800) and Marie Bonnin (1804), known as Adeline, William was brought up a Catholic. He had an elder brother, Alfred, and a younger sister, Marie (known as Hanna), who died when she was seven. The family moved to Saint-Martin-de-Ré in 1832. Another sibling, Kitty, was born in 1834. At the age of twelve, Bouguereau went to Mortagne-sur-Gironde to stay with his uncle Eugène, a priest, and developed a love of nature, religion, and literature. In 1839, he was sent to study for the priesthood at a Catholic college in Pons. Here he learned to draw and paint from Louis Sage, who had studied under Ingres. Bouguereau then reluctantly left his studies to return to his family, now residing in Bordeaux. There he met a local artist, Charles Marionneau, and commenced at the Municipal School of Drawing and Painting in November 1841. Bouguereau also worked as a shop assistant, hand-colouring lithographs and making small paintings that were reproduced using chromolithography. He was soon the best pupil in his class and decided to become an artist in Paris. To fund the move, he sold portraits – 33 oils in three months. All were unsigned and only one has been traced. In 1845, he returned to Mortagne to spend more time with his uncle. He arrived in Paris in March 1846, aged twenty.
Bouguereau became a student at the . To supplement his formal training in drawing, he attended anatomical dissections and studied historical costumes and archeology. He was admitted to the studio of François-Édouard Picot, where he studied painting in the academic style. &quot;Dante and Virgil in Hell&quot; (1850) was an early example of his neo-classical works. Academic painting placed the highest status on historical and mythological subjects and Bouguereau determined to win the , which would gain him a three-year residence at the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy, where, in addition taking formal lessons, he could study firsthand the Renaissance artists and their masterpieces, as well as Greek, Etruscan, and Roman antiquities.

===Villa Medici, Rome 1851–1854===
The young artist entered the contest in April 1848. Soon after work began there were riots in Paris, and Bouguereau enrolled in the National Guard. After an unsuccessful attempt to win the prize, he entered again in 1849. Following 106 days of competition, he again failed to win. His third attempt commenced unsuccessfully in April 1850 with &quot;Dante and Virgil&quot; but five months later, he heard he had won a joint first prize for &quot;Shepherds Find Zenobia on the Banks of the Araxes&quot;. 

Along with other category winners, he set off for Rome in December and finally arrived at the Villa Medici in January 1851. Bouguereau explored the city, making sketches and watercolours as he went. He also studied classical literature, which influenced his subject choice for the rest of his career. He walked to Naples and on to Capri, Amalfi and Pompeii. Still based in Rome and working hard on course work, there were more explorations of Italy in 1852. Although he had a strong admiration for all traditional art, he particularly revered Greek sculpture, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens and Delacroix. In April 1854, he left Rome and returned to La Rochelle.

===Height of career===

Bouguereau, painting within the traditional academic style, exhibited at the annual exhibitions of the Paris Salon for his entire working life. An early reviewer stated, &quot;M. Bouguereau has a natural instinct and knowledge of contour. The eurythmie of the human body preoccupies him, and in recalling the happy results which, in this genre, the ancients and the artists of the sixteenth century arrived at, one can only congratulate M. Bouguereau in attempting to follow in their footsteps ... Raphael was inspired by the ancients ... and no one accused him of not being original.&quot;

Raphael was a favourite of Bouguereau and he took this review as a high compliment. He had fulfilled one of the requirements of the by completing an old-master copy of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The Triumph of Galatea&quot;. In many of his works, he followed the same classical approach to composition, form, and subject matter. Bouguereau&#x27;s graceful portraits of women were considered very charming, partly because he could beautify a sitter while also retaining her likeness.

Although Bouguereau spent most of his life in Paris, he returned to La Rochelle again and again throughout his professional life. He was revered in the town of his birth and undertook decorating commissions from local citizens. From the early 1870s, he and his family spent every summer in La Rochelle. In 1882, he decided that rather than rent he would purchase a house, as well as local farm buildings. By August of that year, the family&#x27;s permanent summer base was on the rue Verdière. The artist commenced several paintings here and completed them in his Paris studio.
Bouguereau flourished after his Villa Medici residence. In 1854–55 he decorated a pavilion at the grand house of a cousin in Angoulins, including four large paintings of figures depicting the seasons. He was happy to undertake other commissions to pay off the debts accrued in Italy and to help his penniless mother. He decorated a mansion with nine large paintings of allegorical figures. In 1856, the Ministry of State for Fine Arts commissioned him to paint &quot;Emperor Napoleon III Visiting the Victims of the Tarascon Flood&quot;. There were decorations for the chapel at Saint-Clotilde. He received the Legion of Honour on 12 July 1859. By this time, Bouguereau was turning away from history painting and lengthy commissions to work on more personal paintings, with realistic and rustic themes.

By the late 1850s, he had made strong connections with art dealers, particularly Paul Durand-Ruel (later the champion of the Impressionists), who helped clients buy paintings from artists who exhibited at the Salons. Thanks to Durand-Ruel, Bouguereau met Hugues Merle, who later often was compared to Bouguereau. The Salons annually drew over 300,000 people, providing valuable exposure to exhibited artists. Bouguereau&#x27;s fame extended to England by the 1860s. Three paintings were shown at the 1863 Salon and &quot;Holy Family&quot; (Now at Chimei Museum) was sold to Napoleon III, who presented it to his wife the Empress Eugénie, who hung it in her Tuileries apartment.
&quot;Bather&quot; (1864), a shocking nude, was submitted to an exhibition in Ghent, Belgium. It was a spectacular success and purchased by the museum at great expense. At this time, William took on decorative work at the Grand Théâtre, Bordeaux, which lasted four years. In 1875, with assistants, he began work on a La Rochelle chapel ceiling, producing six paintings on copper over the next six years. Once installed in the city in summer 1875 he began &quot;Pietà&quot;, one of his greatest religious paintings and shown at the 1876 Salon, in tribute to his son Georges. At the behest of King William III of the Netherlands, Bouguereau went to Het Loo Palace in May 1876. The king admired the artist and they spent intimate times together. In May 1878 the Paris Universal Exhibition opened to showcase French work. Bouguereau found and borrowed twelve of his paintings from their owners, including his new work &quot;Nymphaeum&quot;.

Bouguereau was a staunch traditionalist whose genre paintings and mythological themes were modern interpretations of Classical subjects, both pagan and Christian, with a concentration on the naked female form. The idealized world of his paintings brought to life goddesses, nymphs, bathers, shepherdesses, and madonnas in a way that appealed to wealthy art patrons of the era.

Bouguereau employed traditional methods of working up a painting, including detailed pencil studies and oil sketches, and his careful method resulted in a pleasing and accurate rendering of the human form. His painting of skin, hands, and feet was particularly admired. He also used some of the religious and erotic symbolism of the Old Masters, such as the &quot;broken pitcher&quot; which connoted lost innocence.

Bouguereau received many commissions to decorate private houses and public buildings, and, early on, this added to his prestige and fame. As was typical of such commissions, he would sometimes paint in his own style, and at other times conform to an existing group style. He also made reductions of his public paintings for sale to patrons, of which &quot;The Annunciation&quot; (1888) is an example. He was also a successful portrait painter and many of his paintings of wealthy patrons remain in private hands.

===Académie Julian===
From the 1860s, Bouguereau was closely associated with the where he gave lessons and advice to art students, male and female, from around the world. During several decades he taught drawing and painting to hundreds, if not thousands, of students. Many of them managed to establish artistic careers in their own countries, sometimes following his academic style, and in other cases, rebelling against it, like Henri Matisse. He married his most famous pupil, Elizabeth Jane Gardner, after the death of his first wife.

Bouguereau received many honors from the Academy: he became a Life Member in 1876; received the Grand Medal of Honour in 1885; was appointed Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1885; and was made Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour in 1905. He began to teach drawing at the in 1875, a co-ed art institution independent of the , with no entrance exams and nominal fees.

===Wives and children===
In 1856, William began living with one of his models, Nelly Monchablon, a 19-year-old from Lisle-en-Rigault. Living together unmarried, the pair kept their liaison a secret. Their first child, Henriette, was born in April 1857; Georges was born in January 1859. A third child, Jeanne, was born 25 December 1861. The couple married quietly (as many assumed they were already married) on 24 May 1866. Eight days later, Jeanne died from tuberculosis. In mourning, the couple went to La Rochelle, and Bouguereau made a painting of her in 1868. A fourth child, Adolphe (known as Paul), was born in October 1868. Aged 15, Georges&#x27; health suffered, and his mother took him away from the bad air of Paris. However, he died on 19 June 1875. Nelly had a fifth child in 1876, Maurice, but her health was declining and the doctors suspected that she had contracted tuberculosis. She died on 3 April 1877, and baby Maurice died two months later.

The artist planned to marry Elizabeth Jane Gardner, a pupil whom he had known for ten years, but his mother was opposed to the idea. Soon after Nelly&#x27;s death, she made Bouguereau swear he would not remarry within her lifetime. After his mother&#x27;s death, and after a nineteen-year engagement, he and Gardner married in Paris in June 1896. His wife continued to work as his private secretary, and helped to organize the household staff. His son Paul contracted tuberculosis in early 1899; Paul, his stepmother, and Bouguereau went to Menton in the south. When the stay was prolonged, the artist found a room in which to paint. Paul died at his father&#x27;s house in April 1900, aged 32. Bouguereau had outlived four of his five children: only Henriette outlived him. Elizabeth, who was with her husband to the end, died in Paris in January 1922.

===Homes===
When Bouguereau arrived in Paris in March 1846, he resided at the Hotel Corneille at 5 rue Corneille. In 1855, after his stay in Rome, he lived at 27 rue de Fleurus, and the following year rented a fourth-floor studio at 3 rue Carnot, near his apartment. In 1866, the year of his marriage to Nelly, he bought a vast plot of land on the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, and an architect was commissioned to design a grand house with a top-floor studio. The family was installed in 1868, together with five servants and with his mother, Adeline, visiting daily. Bouguereau spent the rest of his life here and at La Rochelle.

===Later years and death===
Bouguereau was an assiduous painter, often completing twenty or more easel paintings in a single year. Even during the twilight years of his life, he would rise at dawn to work on his paintings six days a week and would continue painting until nightfall. Throughout the course of his lifetime, he is known to have painted at least 822 paintings. Many of these paintings have been lost. Near the end of his life he described his love of his art: &quot;Each day I go to my studio full of joy; in the evening when obliged to stop because of darkness I can scarcely wait for the next morning to come ... if I cannot give myself to my dear painting I am miserable.&quot;

In the spring of 1905, Bouguereau&#x27;s house and studio in Paris were burgled. On 19 August 1905, aged 79, Bouguereau died in La Rochelle from heart disease. There was an outpouring of grief in the town of his birth. After a Mass at the cathedral, his body was placed on a train to Paris for a second ceremony. Bouguereau was laid to rest with Nelly and his children at the family vault at Montparnasse Cemetery.

==Notable works==


==Reputation==
In his own time, Bouguereau was considered to be one of the greatest painters in the world by the academic art community, and simultaneously he was reviled by the avant-garde. He also gained wide fame in Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Romania and in the United States, and commanded high prices. His works often sold within days of completion. Some were viewed by international collectors and bought before work had even finished.

Bouguereau&#x27;s career was nearly a direct ascent with hardly a setback. To many, he epitomized taste and refinement, and a respect for tradition. To others, he was a competent technician stuck in the past. Degas and his associates used the term &quot;Bouguereauté&quot; in a derogatory manner to describe any artistic style reliant on &quot;slick and artificial surfaces&quot;, also known as a licked finish. In an 1872 letter, Degas wrote that he strove to emulate Bouguereau&#x27;s ordered and productive working style, although with Degas&#x27; famous trenchant wit, and the aesthetic tendencies of the Impressionists, it is possible the statement was meant to be ironic. Paul Gauguin loathed him, rating him a round zero in &quot;Racontars de Rapin&quot; and later describing in &quot;Avant et après (Intimate Journals)&quot; the single occasion when Bouguereau made him smile on coming across a couple of his paintings in an Arles brothel, &quot;where they belonged&quot;.

Bouguereau&#x27;s works were eagerly bought by American millionaires who considered him the most important French artist of that time. For example, &quot;Nymphs and Satyr&quot; was purchased first by John Wolfe, then sold by his heiress Catharine Lorillard Wolfe to hotelier Edward Stokes, who displayed it in New York City&#x27;s Hoffman House Hotel. Two paintings by Bouguereau in the Nob Hill mansion of Leland Stanford were destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. Gold Rush tycoon James Ben Ali Haggin and his family, who normally eschewed the nude, made an exception for Bouguereau&#x27;s &quot;Nymphaeum&quot;. In 1890 Bouguereau’s painting &quot;Return of Spring&quot; was damaged at a Foreign art exhibition of local artists in Omaha Nebraska. Carey J. Warbington, an accountant, threw a chair at the painting. After Warbington was convicted of insanity and eventually committed suicide. The picture after the incident still traveled the United States with the tear intact and the chair accompanied the painting also, wherever the painting was shown.

However, even during his lifetime, there was critical dissent in assessing his work; the art historian Richard Muther wrote in 1894 that Bouguereau was a man &quot;destitute of artistic feeling but possessing a cultured taste [who] reveals... in his feeble mawkishness, the fatal decline of the old schools of convention&quot;. In 1926, American art historian Frank Jewett Mather criticized the commercial intent of Bouguereau&#x27;s work, writing that the artist &quot;multiplied vague, pink effigies of nymphs, occasionally draped them, when they became saints and madonnas, painted on the great scale that dominates an exhibition, and has had his reward. I am convinced that the nude of Bouguereau was prearranged to meet the ideals of a New York stockbroker of the black walnut generation.&quot; Bouguereau confessed in 1891 that the direction of his mature work was largely a response to the marketplace: &quot;What do you expect, you have to follow public taste, and the public only buys what it likes. That&#x27;s why, with time, I changed my way of painting.&quot;
Bouguereau fell into disrepute after 1920, due in part to changing tastes. Comparing his work to that of his Realist and Impressionist contemporaries, Kenneth Clark faulted Bouguereau&#x27;s painting for &quot;&quot;, and characterized such Salon art as superficial, employing the &quot;convention of smoothed-out form and waxen surface&quot;.

The New York Cultural Center staged a show of Bouguereau&#x27;s work in 1974—partly as a curiosity, although curator Robert Isaacson had his eye on the long-term rehabilitation of Bouguereau&#x27;s legacy and reputation. In 1984, the Borghi Gallery hosted a commercial show of 23 oil paintings and one drawing. In the same year, a major exhibition was organized by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada. The exhibition opened at the Musée du Petit-Palais, in Paris, traveled to The Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, and concluded in Montréal. More recently, resurgence in the artist&#x27;s popularity has been promoted by American collector Fred Ross, who owns a number of paintings by Bouguereau and features him on his website at Art Renewal Center.

In 2019, the Milwaukee Art Museum assembled more than 40 of Bouguereau&#x27;s paintings for a major retrospective of his work, which according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, asked the readers to &quot;see Bouguereau through the eyes of an age when he was lionized, and Impressionism was dismissed as &#x27;French freedom&#x27;&quot;. The exhibition later was scheduled to travel to the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art in Memphis, Tenn., and then to the San Diego Museum of Art.

Prices for Bouguereau&#x27;s works have climbed steadily since 1975, with major paintings selling at high prices: $1.5 million in 1998 for &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, $2.6 million in 1999 for &quot;The Motherland&quot; and &quot;Charity&quot; at auction in May 2000 for $3.5 million. Bouguereau&#x27;s works are in many public collections.

&quot;Notre Dame des Anges&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Angels&quot;) was last shown publicly in the United States at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. It was donated in 2002 to the Daughters of Mary Mother of Our Savior, an order of nuns affiliated with Clarence Kelly&#x27;s Traditionalist Catholic Society of St. Pius V. In 2009, the nuns sold it for $450,000 to an art dealer, who was able to sell it for more than $2 million. Kelly was subsequently found guilty by a jury in Albany, New York, of defaming the dealer in remarks made in a television interview.

<doc id="399754" wikidata="Q3099723" url="?curid=399754" title="Minister-president">
<text>A minister-president or minister president is the head of government in a number of European countries or subnational governments with a parliamentary or semi-presidential system of government where they preside over the council of ministers. It is an alternative term for prime minister, premier, chief minister, or first minister and very similar to the title of president of the council of ministers.

== Terminology ==
In English-speaking countries, similar institutions may be called premiers or first ministers (typically at the subnational level) or prime ministers (typically at the national level). The plural is sometimes formed by adding an &quot;s&quot; to &quot;minister&quot; and sometimes by adding an &quot;s&quot; to &quot;president&quot;.

The term is used, for instance, as a translation (calque) of the German word .

== Austria ==

From 1867 to 1918, the first minister of the government was known as (minister-president), before that (state chancellor). Today the head of the Austrian Federal Government is called the (federal chancellor), while the head of a state government is called the (literally &#x27;state captain&#x27;), not . In the city-state of Vienna the head of the state government is called the (Mayor and state captain).

== Belgium ==
The term minister-president (, , ) is also used in Belgium to describe the head of government of a Belgian region or linguistic community, but not the head of the Belgian federal government who is referred to as the prime minister (, , ).

According to the Belgian constitution, the federal prime minister is appointed by the king, and approved by the federal parliament with a vote of confidence (in practice the king usually appoints the leader of the winning party as to form a government). The federal ministers later swear an oath of allegiance to the king. The minister-presidents of the regions and linguistic communities are not appointed by the king, but are directly appointed by their respective parliament. Ministers of the regions and linguistic communities are not required to swear allegiance to the king but simply take an oath in their respective parliament.

See:
* Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region
* Minister-President of Flanders
* Minister-President of the French Community
* Minister-President of Wallonia
* Minister-President of the German-speaking Community

== Germany ==

A Minister President () is the head of government in 13 of the 16 States of Germany. Exceptions are the city-states of Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen, where the head of government is called, respectively, the Governing Mayor (), First Mayor () and Mayor and President of the Senate (). On the federal level, the head of the federal government (with an effectively identical function as leader of the cabinet) is called the Chancellor or Federal Chancellor ( or ). The positions of Minister-president in the German states (during the monarchy days) were mostly established in response to the 1848 German revolutions. The Minister-President of Prussia usually served simultaneously as the Imperial Chancellor.

== Hungary ==
The title of Hungary&#x27;s head of government in Hungarian is which literally translated means &quot;minister-president&quot;. However, because &quot;prime minister&quot; or &quot;premier&quot; is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations, is almost always translated as &quot;prime minister.&quot;

== Latvia ==
The Minister president is the head of government. &quot;Minister-President&quot; in the Constitution of Latvia of February 15, 1922, arose when the German term (minister-president) was translated; the term (literally &#x27;president of ministers&#x27;, in Latvian) was coined by the member of the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, Latvian writer Kārlis Skalbe.

== Netherlands ==
In the Netherlands the prime minister is officially referred to as &quot;minister-president&quot;, although the informal term &quot;premier&quot; is also frequently used. His responsibilities are defined in the constitution of 1848 as the (&#x27;chair of the council of ministers&#x27;). The title of minister-president has been in use since 1945 and officially added to the constitution in 1983.

== Norway ==
In Norway, Vidkun Quisling, head of the collaborationist government from 1942 to 1945 during the German occupation in World War II, held the title of Minister-President ().

== Russian Republic ==
During the short lived Russian Republic, the role of a Minister-President was established. Alexander Kerensky was chosen to lead the provisional government.

<text>Cinema 4D is a 3D software suite developed by the German company Maxon.

==Overview==

As of R21, only a single version of Cinema 4D is available. It replaces all previous variants, including BodyPaint 3D, and includes all features of the past &#x27;Studio&#x27; variant. With R21, all binaries were unified. There is no technical difference between commercial, educational, or demo versions. The difference is now only in licensing.
2014 saw the release of Cinema 4D Lite, which came packaged with Adobe After Effects Creative Cloud 2014. &quot;Lite&quot; acts as an introductory version, with many features withheld. This is part of a partnership between the two companies, where a Maxon-produced plug-in, called Cineware, allows any variant to create a seamless workflow with After Effects. The &quot;Lite&quot; variant is dependent on After Effects CC, needing the latter application running to launch, and is only sold as a package component included with After Effects CC through Adobe.

Initially, Cinema 4D was developed for Amiga computers in the early 1990s, and the first three versions of the program were available exclusively for that platform. With v4, however, Maxon began to develop the application for Windows and Macintosh computers as well, citing the wish to reach a wider audience and the growing instability of the Amiga market following Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy. It was also released for BeOS.

On Linux, Cinema 4D is available as a commandline rendering version.

==Modules and older variants==

From R12 to R20, Cinema 4D was available in four variants. A core Cinema 4D &#x27;Prime&#x27; application, a &#x27;Broadcast&#x27; version with additional motion-graphics features, &#x27;Visualize,&#x27; which adds functions for architectural design and &#x27;Studio,&#x27; which includes all modules.

From Release 8 until Release 11.5, Cinema 4D had a modular approach to the application, with the ability to expand upon the core application with various modules. This ended with Release 12, though the functionality of these modules remains in the different flavors of Cinema 4D (Prime, Broadcast, Visualize, Studio)

The old modules were:
* Advanced Render (global illumination/HDRI, caustics, ambient occlusion and sky simulation)
* BodyPaint 3D (direct painting on UVW meshes; now included in the core. In essence Cinema 4D Core/Prime and the BodyPaint 3D products are identical. The only difference between the two is the splash screen that is shown at startup and the default user interface.)
* Dynamics (for simulating soft body and rigid body dynamics)
* Hair (simulates hair, fur, grass, etc.)
* MOCCA (character animation and cloth simulation)
* MoGraph (Motion Graphics procedural modelling and animation toolset)
* NET Render (to render animations over a TCP/IP network in render farms)
* PyroCluster (simulation of smoke and fire effects)
*Prime (the core application)
*Broadcast (adds MoGraph2)
*Visualize (adds Virtual Walkthrough, Advanced Render, Sky, Sketch and Toon, data exchange, camera matching)
*Studio (the complete package)

==Version history==
==Use in industry==
A number of films and related works have been modeled and rendered in Cinema 4D, including:
==Cinebench==
Cinebench is a cross-platform test suite which tests a computer&#x27;s hardware capabilities. It can be used as a test for Cinema 4D&#x27;s 3D modeling, animation, motion graphic and rendering performance on multiple CPU cores. The program &quot;target[s] a certain niche and [is] better suited for high-end desktop and workstation platforms&quot;.

Cinebench is commonly used to demonstrate hardware capabilities at tech shows to show a CPU performance, especially by Tech YouTubers and review sites.

<doc id="399760" wikidata="Q15525530" url="?curid=399760" title="Howard Jarvis">
<text>Howard Arnold Jarvis (September 22, 1903 – August 12, 1986) was an American businessman, lobbyist, and politician. He was a tax policy activist responsible for passage of California&#x27;s Proposition 13 in 1978.

==Early life and education==
Jarvis was born in Magna, Utah. Although he was raised as a Mormon, he smoked cigars and drank vodka as an adult.

He graduated from Utah State University. In Utah, he had some political involvement working with his father&#x27;s campaigns and his own. His father was a state Supreme Court judge and, unlike Jarvis, a member of the Democratic Party. Howard Jarvis was active in the Republican Party and also ran small town newspapers. He served as a press officer for Herbert Hoover&#x27;s 1932 presidential campaign and supported Barry Goldwater in 1964. 

He moved to California in the 1930s due to a suggestion by Earl Warren. Jarvis bought his home at 515 North Crescent Heights Boulevard in Los Angeles for $8,000 in 1941. By 1976, it was assessed at $80,000. He married his third wife, Estelle Garcia, around 1965.

==Political career==
Jarvis was a Republican primary candidate for the U.S. Senate in California in 1962, but the nomination and the election went to the moderate Republican Thomas Kuchel. Subsequently, he ran several times for Mayor of Los Angeles on an anti-tax platform and gained a reputation as a harsh critic of government. He founded the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association in 1978.

The HJTA pushed for the passage of California Proposition 13 in 1978. The proposition adjusted the property tax rate, pegging it at 1% of the purchase price of the property. This proposal was popular, largely due to the high inflation and associated rises in property taxes through the 1970s. Jarvis and his wife collected tens of thousands of signatures to enable Prop. 13 to appear on a statewide ballot, for which he garnered national attention. The ballot measure passed with nearly two-thirds of the vote. Two years later, voters in Massachusetts enacted a similar measure.

In the campaign, Jarvis argued that lowering property tax rates would cause landlords to pass savings onto renters, who were upset at their rapidly rising rents driven by the high inflation of the 1970s. Most landlords did not do this, which became a motivating factor for rent control.

==Awards==
In 1979, Jarvis received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

==Controversies==

=== DUI arrest ===
Jarvis was arrested for DUI on March 15, 1978 Jarvis was pulled over in Ventura county by officer Michael Kipp for driving at a high rate of speed and swerving across lanes. Kipp testified that Jarvis failed three sobriety tests and was unable to recite the alphabet. Kipper further stated that during their interaction Jarvis denied driving the car and remarked &quot;That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m Howard Jarvis and you realize what you&#x27;ve done to yourself&quot;. During the trial Jarvis argued that his erratic driving was the result of threats against his life which triggered fear and anxiety.

=== Racial slurs ===
Jarvis was heard referring to one of his Jewish opponents as a &quot;lying kike lawyer from Brooklyn&quot;. The incident was reported during the failed Proposition 9 campaign of 1980. Proposition 9 was an effort championed by Jarvis designed to limit income taxes in California. Following a debate with attorney and former assemblyman William T. Bagley on San Francisco television station KPIX Jarvis reportedly commended Bagley for his debate performance and, as Bagley recalls it, stated &quot;You&#x27;re not like Reiner. He is a goddamned lying lawyer kike son of a bitch from Brooklyn.&quot; Jarvis was referring to Los Angeles city controller Ira Reiner, who is Jewish, and was a strong opponent of Proposition 9. San Francisco Examiner reporter Jim Wood recalled hearing Jarvis only say &quot;lying kike lawyer from Brooklyn&quot; in reference to Reiner.

Jarvis was criticized by Asian-American groups for using the slur &quot;Japs&quot; after the defeat of Proposition 9
&quot;The public employees have won the first battle like the Japs won the first battle at Pearl Harbor, but the United States won the war.&quot; remarked Jarvis following the election. The slur also appears in print in Jarvis&#x27; 1979 book &quot;I&#x27;m Mad as Hell: The Exclusive Story of the Tax Revolt and Its Leader&quot;.

==Film appearance==
In 1980, he had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, playing an incredibly patient taxicab passenger. His character apparently spends the entire movie sitting in an empty cab waiting for the driver (played by Robert Hays) to return, with the meter running all the while. Jarvis has the final line in the movie, which he says after the end credits; he looks at his watch and says &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll give him another twenty minutes, but that&#x27;s it!&quot; The inside joke was that Jarvis would never have paid for such a charge in real life.

==Death==
Jarvis died in 1986 in Los Angeles at the age of 82, of complications of a blood disease.

<doc id="399761" wikidata="Q1579545" url="?curid=399761" title="John Hewson">
<text>John Robert Hewson AM (born 28 October 1946) is an Australian former politician who served as leader of the Liberal Party from 1990 to 1994. He led the Liberal-National Coalition to defeat at the 1993 Australian federal election.

Hewson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and earned a PhD in Economics from Johns Hopkins University. He has also attained degrees from the University of Sydney and the University of Regina. Before entering politics, Hewson worked as an economist for the Reserve Bank of Australia, an economic advisor to the Fraser government, a business journalist, and a director of Macquarie Bank.

In 1987, Hewson was elected to the House of Representatives. He was appointed to the shadow cabinet in 1988, serving under John Howard and Andrew Peacock. After Peacock lost the 1990 election, Hewson was elected leader of the Liberal Party in his place, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition. In 1991, he launched the &quot;Fightback!&quot; policy manifesto, which proposed a series of major economic reforms with a goods and services tax (GST) as its centrepiece.

Political platforms in the 1993 federal election focused mainly on economic policy, especially on how Australia should respond to the early 1990s recession. The Labor Party – led by Paul Keating – had been in power for 10 years at that point. Many polls suggested a Coalition victory, however Labor was able to mount a successful campaign, with the party&#x27;s net increase in seats allowing Keating to remain Prime Minister. Hewson continued on as Liberal leader for another year, losing a leadership spill to Alexander Downer in 1994. He left parliament the following year. Since then, Hewson has continued to be a public expert in business and political commentary. He resigned his Liberal Party membership in 2019, having been a critic of its policy direction for a number of years, particularly on climate change.

==Early life==
Hewson was born at Baroda Private Hospital in Carlton, Sydney, New South Wales. He was the first of four children born to Eileen Isabella (née Tippett) and Donald Hewson. His mother was born in England and arrived in Australia at the age of six. His father worked as a fitter and turner. Hewson spent his early years in Carlton, where his parents lived with his paternal grandmother and his father&#x27;s three sisters. His father eventually saved enough money to buy a house in Beverly Hills. Hewson attended Carlton Primary School and Beverly Hills North Primary School before attending Kogarah High School, graduating in 1963. He subsequently completed a Bachelor of Economics degree at the University of Sydney in 1967. He then completed a master&#x27;s degree at the Regina, Canada campus of the University of Saskatchewan (which since 1974 has been the University of Regina) and a second master&#x27;s and a doctorate in economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In 1967, he married Margaret Deaves.

Upon returning to Australia, Hewson worked as an economist for the Reserve Bank of Australia. From 1976 to 1983 he was employed as an economic advisor to two successive Liberal treasurers, Phillip Lynch and John Howard. During this period he developed an interest in politics and became determined to enter politics himself. While he espoused strong liberal views, he was critical of what he saw as unconvincing and inconsistent Liberal Party economic policies. He was a supporter of some of the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher.

After the defeat of the Fraser government in the 1983 election, Hewson went into business journalism and became a director of a private bank, the Macquarie Bank. After divorcing Margaret Deaves in 1985, Hewson would go on to marry Carolyn Somerville in 1988. Deaves claims that Hewson left her because he was under the impression she would not be able to cope with the responsibilities of public life as the wife of a prominent public servant despite her working to support him while he was studying overseas.

==Politics==
Hewson was elected to the House of Representatives for the affluent Sydney electorate of Wentworth in the 1987 federal election. Before the election he was told he would have to give up his Ferrari to be pre-selected. However, Hewson kept his car despite it attracting controversy. He entered Parliament at a time when there was a leadership vacuum among the conservatives. The Coalition, led by John Howard, lost the 1987 election, but a majority of Liberal MPs voted to keep him as leader over his predecessor Andrew Peacock.

Hewson was Howard&#x27;s advisor when Howard was Treasurer and the two formed a friendship. However their friendship hit a low point when Hewson won Liberal preselection for Wentworth. After Hewson&#x27;s preselection, Howard was seen talking to Dr. Jane Munro, who like Hewson was also an academic and was Hewson&#x27;s main rival for the preselection. Hewson then angrily accused Howard of supporting Munro for the preselection instead of Hewson. Government and Opposition MPs who are new to Parliament usually take their place on the backbench but Hewson believed he was an exception to this due to his personal history with Howard. Hewson was therefore disappointed not to be offered a shadow portfolio by Howard.

Hewson instead sat on the backbench until September 1988 when Howard appointed Hewson as shadow finance minister. In May 1989, when Andrew Peacock replaced Howard as Leader after a challenge in which Hewson voted for Howard, Hewson became shadow treasurer. Even prior to Howard&#x27;s removal, when Peacock was the shadow treasurer, Hewson had been seen as the real shadow treasurer. In the lead-up to the 1990 election, Hewson, the trained economist, was seen to have performed well against the then-treasurer Paul Keating. In December 1989, Hewson claimed that Keating was reluctant to debate with him on the economy.

===Election to Leadership of the Opposition===
When the Coalition were defeated at the 1990 federal elections, Peacock quit and supported Hewson, who was elected to the Liberal leadership despite having been in Parliament for only three years, as Hewson had been one of the top Liberal players in the 1990 election campaign. In the contest for leadership, Hewson defeated Peter Reith 62 votes to 13. Reith was then elected deputy leader over David Jull, with Hewson making Reith Shadow Treasurer. One of the reasons for Hewson&#x27;s election to the leadership was that Peacock wanted to prevent Howard from regaining leadership. Another reason for Hewson&#x27;s election was a desire by the Liberal party to have generational change, according to John Howard, who believed Hewson was not ready to be leader. Previously, Hewson had endorsed Peacock as his deputy, which created much resentment for him among Howard&#x27;s supporters. Peacock, however, had no interest in becoming deputy leader again and withdrew his candidacy. In 1991, Hewson&#x27;s ex-wife Margaret declared on &quot;60 minutes&quot; that she would vote for him at the next election, as did his son Tim, who claimed Hewson had placed politics before his family and that was why his father had divorced Margaret. Margaret claimed the first six months of her divorce was the hardest and she had not realised someone else was on the scene. Hewson&#x27;s shadow ministry included newly elected Member for Higgins Peter Costello; Hewson had told Costello he would not be a Minister in a Hewson government, a joke Costello would relay years later. In 1991, Hewson spoke at the Australian Council of Social Services, where he stated that the organisation was reinforcing the biblical reminder that &quot;the Poor are with us forever&quot; by making welfare provisions larger and otherwise want to acquire more money for welfare and making bureaucracies larger. This caused controversy for Hewson, who came to be seen as harsh and untrustworthy in the mind of Australian reporter Laurie Oakes.

===Fightback! and the 1993 Federal Election===

Shortly after gaining the leadership, Hewson made up ground on the Hawke government in the opinion polls as the Australian economy struggled with the early 1990s recession. Hewson was determined to make a break with what he saw as the &quot;weak pragmatism of past Liberal leaders.&quot; In November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations laws including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes, and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different direction from the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centrepiece of the policy document.

In December 1991, Keating successfully defeated Hawke and became prime minister. In 1992, Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class, as it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Keating memorably described the impact of Hewson&#x27;s GST as &quot;15% on this, 15% on that&quot;, and Hewson as a &quot;feral abacus.&quot;

In 1992, Hewson attacked New South Wales Labor leader Bob Carr for his lack of a family life when compared to Liberal Premier John Fahey, stating, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to be suspicious of a guy that doesn&#x27;t drive, doesn&#x27;t like kids and things like that. When he&#x27;s up against a full-blooded Australian like John Fahey, he hasn&#x27;t got a hope&quot;. Keating responded by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think Ben Chifley had any trouble being a full-blooded Australian and he didn&#x27;t have any children&quot;, and Hewson was later forced to withdraw the remark. Carr and his wife Helena did not respond to Hewson&#x27;s attack.

Keating won the 1993 election, marking a record fifth consecutive Labor term, with the Coalition losing what many had described as &quot;the unlosable election&quot; for them. The issue of the GST was dropped from the Liberal Party&#x27;s agenda until the 1998 election campaign. Apart from the GST, other factors were believed to have contributed to the 1993 election defeat, including the fear of changes to Medicare and the zero Tariff policy. Peter Costello stated that he believes Hewson&#x27;s Fightback! campaign caused unnecessary confrontations and that Hewson lacked the experience to know which policies to fight for and which ones to leave alone. Notable confrontations including the GST proposal receiving opposition from Churches and Welfare as well as opposition to abolishing bulk billing and changing superannuation. An additional reason for the defeat was the partial backdown Hewson made in Fightback! policy in 1992 by agreeing not to levy the GST on food. This concession caused Hewson to be exposed to assertions of weakness and inconsistency, and also complicated the financial arithmetic of the whole package, as the weakening of the GST reduced the scope for tax cuts, the most attractive element of the package for middle-class voters. The complications of the revised Fightback! package were demonstrated in the &quot;birthday cake interview&quot;, in which Hewson was unable to answer a question posed by journalist Mike Willesee about whether or not a birthday cake would cost more or less under a Coalition government. Hewson was instead forced into a series of circumlocutions about whether the cake would be decorated, have ice cream in it and so on, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. In reference to the birthday cake interview in an August 2006 interview, Hewson said: &quot;Well I answered the question honestly. The answer&#x27;s actually right. That doesn&#x27;t count...I should have told him (Mike Willesee) to get stuffed!&quot;. According to Channel 9&#x27;s 20 to 1 episode &quot;Unscripted and Unplanned&quot;, the Birthday Cake Interview incident was the moment Hewson lost the election with the interview held 10 days before polling day, even though polls supported a Coalition victory right up to election day.

===Loss of leadership &amp; retirement===
Hewson announced that if the Coalition lost the 1993 election, he would resign as Liberal Leader. However, he changed his mind after the election and decided to not resign as Leader due to his objection to John Howard as his replacement, and the uncertainty this would create for issues like the Native Act and the Republic issue. Hewson felt he had to remain Leader, believing that Howard failed his Liberal leadership tenure from 1985 to 1989 and would not be a good leader of the party. Hewson also rejected suggestions like the one made by Senator Michael Baume that he was being used by Andrew Peacock and his supporters to block Howard from returning. Hewson defeated Howard in a post-election party leadership challenge in March 1993, which included the nomination of Bruce Reid, Member for Bendigo.

However, Hewson was not guaranteed to still be Coalition Leader by the time of the next Federal election in early 1996. Liberal MP&#x27;s such as Peter Costello and Bronwyn Bishop consistently undermined his leadership over the subsequent year; the media coverage of Bishop&#x27;s transfer from the Senate to the House of Representatives in 1994 damaged Hewson in a similar fashion to how the Joh for Canberra campaign damaged John Howard in the 1980s. Through persistent questions over his leadership, Hewson&#x27;s consistent response was that &quot;leadership is not an issue&quot;. Highly regarded Australian psephologist Antony Green believes that had the former deputy Liberal leader Fred Chaney not retired in 1993 he could have succeeded Hewson as Liberal leader in 1993. Chaney was described by Hewson as &quot;the little ***** from the West&quot;.

As well as staying as Leader after the 1993 election defeat, Hewson also appointed himself Shadow Minister for Arts and Heritage, a position he held until the end of his leadership in May 1994. During this time he shadowed Arts Ministers Bob McMullan and Michael Lee.

In 1993, during Parliamentary question time, Hewson declared to Paul Keating that the passing of the Mabo act would be &quot;a day of shame&quot; for Australia, stating that an alternative solution should be sought for the Aborigines. Hewson claimed his inflammatory remarks were directed at Keating&#x27;s policy and not extinguishing pastoral leases, but he never explained what better solution he was seeking and never withdrew his offensive remarks. In 1994, Hewson declared Fightback! to be dead. Around the same time, he declared his support for the Mardi Gras. Although the Labor Treasurer John Dawkins had presented a badly received 1993/1994 budget, Hewson seemed to not be making any momentum against the Federal Labor government as he had done in his previous parliamentary term. Hewson gave a speech arguing that hardline Monarchists were an anachronism, which resulted in John Howard storming into his office and shouting that Australia would be a republic over his dead body.

In early 1994, Labor Minister Ros Kelly became involved in a scandal known as the &#x27;sports rorts&#x27; affair, which eventually led to her resignation. Kelly had previously stated that Hewson would be the only one resigning. In May 1994, Hewson asserted that he was leader of the Liberal party, and was surprised by negative internal party polling on an episode of &quot;Lateline&quot;, which led to his falling out with Liberal Federal Director Andrew Robb. Hewson attempted to silence leadership speculation in general by calling a leadership ballot on 23 May 1994. However, he lost the vote and the leadership to Alexander Downer, who had undermined Hewson while acting as Shadow Treasurer. Hewson had also lost the support of Federal Liberal Party President Tony Staley and Andrew Peacock, who had supported Hewson four years earlier and against Howard&#x27;s 1993 leadership challenge. Staley broke it off with Hewson after being informed by fellow Liberal party member Ron Walker of difficulties in fundraising following the 1993 election defeat. Staley believed Hewson to be unelectable. Journalist Laurie Oakes claimed that Hewson viewed Peter Costello as his would-be challenger, unaware of the threat posed by Downer. Several days later after blaming Andrew Robb for his losing the leadership to Downer, Hewson was appointed as Shadow Minister for Industry, Commerce, Infrastructure, and Customs in Downer&#x27;s shadow cabinet, becoming the third former Liberal leader in the group alongside Peacock (who quit politics later that year) and Howard.

Notwithstanding not foreseeing Downer as his replacement when he appointed him Shadow Treasurer, Hewson&#x27;s strategy of saving his leadership was to promote rivals such as promoting Peter Costello to the Finance portfolio and bringing Bronwyn Bishop straight to Shadow Cabinet from the backbench with the new portfolio of Urban and Regional Strategy.

Despite his advocacy of right-wing economics, Hewson supported abortion, gay rights, and increasing working mothers&#x27; benefits. In August 1994, Hewson was dismissed by Downer from the shadow ministry after declaring his view on homosexual rights and for promoting himself as the conscience of the liberal party in Downer view. During January 1995, following a controversial joke about domestic violence policy several months prior, Downer, at the risk of a leadership challenge from John Howard, asked Hewson for his support against Howard. Hewson released a statement indicating that he would support either Downer or Howard for leadership, on the condition that he became Shadow Treasurer. This led to Peter Costello (The Shadow Treasurer) stating that Hewson&#x27;s days had passed and describing him as a suicide bomber. Several days later, Downer resigned and Howard was elected Liberal leader for his second period. Hewson was not returned to the front bench as part of the Howard shadow cabinet and speculation spread that he intended to leave politics, a claim he denied while at the same time endorsing John Howard as Liberal party leader and prime minister. Former New South Wales Premier Nick Greiner confirmed he had advised Hewson to retire.

On 28 February 1995, Hewson announced in the House of Representatives that he would resign as Member for Wentworth, citing his second wife&#x27;s pregnancy and the fact he was seen as interfering when he spoke up and as holding a seat he should vacate if he remained silent. He said in his resignation speech that while the Coalition might have won in 1993, if he had not released the &quot;Fightback!&quot; document before the election he would have had difficulty in passing legislation with the Senate, and he had therefore released it in an effort to secure support and gain a mandate for its goals. He also predicted that under Howard, the Coalition would win the next election as the electorate took its revenge on those who had pursued a &quot;politics of fear and misrepresentation&quot; in 1993. He is the only Liberal leader to leave politics without serving as a minister Hewson was replaced by Andrew Thomson in the 1995 Wentworth by Election. Analysts had speculated that had Hewson remained in Parliament, he would have been at risk of losing Liberal party endorsement in a party pre-selection challenge to his seat potentially from Peter King. In other words, Hewson would have been forced to retire at subsequent federal election unless he stood as an independent if he quit the parliamentary liberal party. Hewson&#x27;s former chief of staff, Tony Abbott, who had just entered Parliament in the Warringah by-election, was among those who voted against Hewson in the May 1994 spill. In the immediate aftermath, Abbott told &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; that Hewson should be remembered for his first three years as leader, when he united the party following divisions caused by the Peacock-Howard rivalry, and not for his last twelve months. Abbott also remarked that as &quot;Fightback!&quot; was central to a Hewson Prime Ministership, when the initiative was abandoned, Hewson had nothing to stand on as a leader. In fact unlike Peacock and Howard or Malcolm Turnbull who departed from the Liberal Party leadership before returning to it there was no chance of Hewson regaining the position of leader.
Hewson is alleged to have not taken advice from experts as leader and also closing the door on the backbench liberal mps.

Hewson&#x27;s career stands as one of the shortest of any political party leader in Australia. Former Liberal Federal director Andrew Robb believes Hewson and the Liberals were spooked into releasing the policies of &quot;Fightback!&quot; too early by the Hawke government and parts of the media. Despite the 1993 election being regarded as a rejection of &quot;Fightback!&quot;, several parts of it were later adopted into law during the final term of the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (including the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.

==Career after politics==
Since his departure from politics, Hewson has written extensively for the business and general press and spent time on the lecture circuit. In his writings, he demonstrated an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility. In 2003 and 2004, he chaired a community advisory committee for RepuTex, a company that provides analysis and forecasting for the energy sector and issued an annual public listing of Australia&#x27;s top 100 socially and environmentally conscious companies.

===Business and academic activity===
In 1995, in one of his few private enterprise successes, Hewson was invited to join IT&amp;T Services as a non-executive director. IT&amp;T was a specialist IT and telecommunications design and project management group that delivered major technology projects for both corporate and government clients such as Citigroup, the Department of Defence, News Limited, and Ernst &amp; Young across the Asia Pacific region. IT&amp;T Services was acquired by the public company Powerlan Ltd in 2000. Hewson then became a professor of management at Macquarie University, Sydney, and Dean of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management in 2002, but resigned within two years. While at Macquarie University, he also served as a consultant to ABN AMRO.

In 2005, Hewson was elected to the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA) board as an independent member. He left in June 2006 after a dispute with V8 Supercars Australia chairman Tony Cochrane. Hewson held the position of chairman of the board of directors for the Elderslie Group, a company whose primary interests were corporate finance and property investments. Hewson touted the company to investors at a time when Elderslie was in financial difficulties, eventually leaving the company facing liquidation and large losses. When he resigned, he said that he was unsatisfied with the direction in which the Group was heading. On 2 July 2008, global accounting firm PwC was appointed as receiver and administrator of the failed Elderslie Group. Since around 2005, Hewson has been a member of the Trilateral Commission, an alliance of top political and economic leaders from North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.

In December 2012, Hewson was appointed as a non-executive director of Larus Energy, an oil and gas company developing operations in Papua New Guinea.

===Political commentary===
After 1996 Hewson became increasingly critical of Prime Minister John Howard. In 2003 he opposed Howard&#x27;s decision to take part in the Iraq War although in 2004 argued it would be electoral &quot;suicide&quot; for the Liberal Party to replace Howard with an alternative leader. In July 2006, Hewson gave an interview to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Four Corners&quot; program in which he voiced concern at the growing influence of what he characterised as a &quot;hardline right religious element&quot; in the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party. This was in breach of a Liberal Party rule about speaking to the media and reports at the time claimed he could face expulsion from the party.

Hewson has repeatedly appeared in television interviews and on political panels and has been a regular columnist for the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; since 2004.

In 2011 Hewson was among 140 Australian community leaders who pledged support for an Emissions trading scheme, despite the fact the Coalition and its leader Tony Abbott (Hewson&#x27;s former Press Secretary) opposed the carbon tax. In July 2015, Hewson was critical of Prime Minister Tony Abbott&#x27;s continuing support for Speaker Bronwyn Bishop during the travel expenses scandal, stating that the cost of that support would be &quot;enormous&quot;.

=== Departure from the Liberal Party ===
In a 2019 interview on Sky News in which he was speaking alongside Greens MP Adam Bandt, Hewson said that he had let his membership of the Liberal Party lapse. He has criticised various Liberal Party members, including former Prime Ministers Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison for their poor record on climate action. Hewson publicly campaigned for a price on carbon, a policy introduced by the Gillard Labor government and opposed by the Liberal Party&#x27;s then leader Tony Abbott, who went on to scrap it as prime minister.

===Awards===
On 26 January 2001, Hewson was honored as a Member of the Order of Australia.

==Personal life==
Hewson married Margaret Deaves in 1967 and they divorced in 1985. In 1988 he married Carolyn Somerville who was described by the media as &quot;a formidable figure in investment banking&quot;. They divorced in 2004.

In 2007, Hewson married publicist Jessica Wilson. , they reside in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales.

Since leaving politics, Hewson has been involved in a range of non-profit organisations, including the Arthritis Foundation of Australia and KidsXpress, a charity providing expressive therapy for children.

<doc id="399763" wikidata="Q2665587" url="?curid=399763" title="Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement">
<text>The Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA), official name as the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States of America (), was a bilateral trade agreement reached by negotiators for Canada and the United States on October 4, 1987, and signed by the leaders of both countries on January 2, 1988. The agreement phased out a wide range of trade restrictions in stages, over a ten-year period, and resulted in a substantial increase in cross-border trade as an improvement to the last replaced trade deal. With the addition of Mexico in 1994, CUSFTA was superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (, ).

As stated in the agreement, the main purposes of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement were:
*Eliminate barriers to trade in goods and services between Canada and the United States
*Facilitate conditions of fair competition within the free-trade area established by the Agreement
*Significantly liberalize conditions for investment within that free-trade area
*Establish effective procedures for the joint administration of the Agreement and the resolution of disputes
*Lay the foundation for further bilateral and multilateral cooperation to expand and enhance the benefits of the Agreement

==History==
===Background===

Starting in 1855, while Canada was under British control, free trade was implemented between the colonies of British North America and the United States under the Reciprocity Treaty. In 1866, a year before Canadian Confederation, the United States Congress voted to cancel the treaty. Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, attempted and failed to reinstate reciprocity, after which the government of Canada moved to a more protectionist policy, the National Policy. Fears grew among many politicians that closer economic ties with the United States would lead to political annexation.

The Liberal Party of Canada had traditionally supported free trade. Free trade in natural products was a central issue in the 1911 Canadian federal election. The Conservative Party campaigned using anti-American rhetoric, and the Liberals lost the election. The issue of free trade did not rise to this level of national prominence in Canada again for many decades.

From 1935 to 1980, the two nations entered a number of bilateral trade agreements that greatly reduced tariffs in both nations. The most significant of these agreements was the 1960s Automotive Products Trade Agreement (also known as the Auto Pact).

After the signing of the Auto Pact, the Canadian Government considered proposing free-trade agreements in other sectors of the economy. However, the United States government was less receptive to this idea, and in fact, wanted to phase out some guarantees in the Pact. Canadian attention turned to the question of a broader free-trade agreement between the two countries.

During the next two decades, a number of academic economists studied the effects of a free trade agreement between the two countries. Several of them—Ronald Wonnacott and Paul Wonnacott, and Richard G. Harris and David Cox—concluded that Canadian real GDP would be significantly increased if both U.S. and Canadian tariffs and other trade barriers were removed and Canadian industry could consequently produce at larger, more efficient scale. Other economists on the free-trade side included John Whalley of the University of Western Ontario and Richard Lipsey of the C. D. Howe Institute.

Others were concerned that free trade would have negative effects, fearing capital flight and job insecurity because of international outsourcing, and also that closer economic ties with the &quot;Giant to the South&quot; might risk an erosion of Canadian sovereignty. Opponents included Mel Watkins of the University of Toronto and David Crane of the Toronto Star, one of Canada&#x27;s leading newspapers.

A number of government studies drew increasing attention to the possibility of a bilateral free-trade negotiation: Looking Outward (1975), by the Economic Council of Canada; several reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs (1975, 1978, and 1982); and the 1985 report of the Macdonald Commission (formally, the &quot;Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada&quot;), chaired by former Liberal politician Donald Stovel Macdonald. Macdonald declared that &quot;Canadians should be prepared to take a leap of faith&quot; and pursue more open trade with the United States. Although Macdonald was a former Liberal Minister of Finance, the commission&#x27;s findings were embraced by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party, even though they had opposed a free-trade initiative in the 1984 Canadian election campaign. The stage was set for the beginning of free-trade negotiations.

===Negotiations===
US President Ronald Reagan welcomed the Canadian initiative and the United States Congress gave the President the authority to sign a free trade agreement with Canada, subject to it being presented for Congressional review by October 5, 1987. In May 1986, Canadian and American negotiators began to work out a trade deal. The Canadian team was led by former deputy Minister of Finance Simon Reisman and the American side by Peter O. Murphy, the former deputy United States trade representative in Geneva.

The agreement between the two countries ultimately created substantially liberalized trade between them, removing most remaining tariffs, although tariffs were only a minor part of the FTA. Average tariffs on goods crossing the border were well below 1% by the 1980s. Instead, Canada desired unhindered access to the American economy. Americans, in turn, wished to have access to Canada&#x27;s energy and cultural industries.

In the negotiations, Canada retained the right to protect its cultural industries and such sectors as education and health care. As well, some resources such as water were meant to be left out of the agreement. The Canadians did not succeed in winning free competition for American government procurement contracts. Canadian negotiators also insisted on the inclusion of a dispute resolution mechanism.

===Debate and implementation===

The debate in Canada over whether to implement the negotiated agreement was very contentious. The opposition Liberal Party vociferously opposed the agreement, with Liberal leader John Turner saying that he would &quot;tear it up&quot; if he became prime minister, and the New Democratic Party under leader Ed Broadbent also strongly opposed the agreement. Both parties contended that the agreement would erode Canadian sovereignty, arguing that Canada would effectively become the &quot;51st state&quot; of the US if the agreement was implemented. They also raised concerns about how Canada&#x27;s social programs and other trade agreements such as the Auto Pact would be affected.

The legislation to implement the agreement was delayed in the Senate, which had a Liberal majority. Partly in response to these delays, Mulroney called an election in 1988. The Trade Agreement was by far the most prominent issue of the campaign, prompting some to call it the &quot;Free Trade Election.&quot; It was the first Canadian election to feature large third-party campaign advertising, with supporters and opponents using lobbyists to buy television advertisements.

It was also the first Canadian election to use much negative advertising; one anti-free-trade advertisement showed negotiators &quot;removing a line&quot; from the Free Trade Agreement, which at the end of the advertisement was revealed to be the Canada–US border. Although some opinion polls showed slightly more Canadians against the Agreement than in favour of it, Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives benefited from being the only party in favour of the agreement, while the Liberals and NDP split the anti-free trade vote. In addition, future Quebec Premiers Jacques Parizeau and Bernard Landry backed the agreement which was seen as a factor for the PC party support in Quebec. Mulroney won a governing majority and the agreement was passed into law, even though a majority of the voters had voted for parties opposing free trade.

The Free Trade Agreement faced much less opposition in the US. Polls showed that up to 40% of Americans were unaware that the agreement had been signed. The Agreement implementation act was given to the Congress for &quot;fast-track&quot; approval by President Reagan on July 26, 1988, meaning that it could be accepted or rejected but could not be amended. The United States–Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 366 - 40 on August 9, 1988 and by the Senate by a vote of 83–9 on September 19, 1988. President Reagan signed the Act on September 28, 1988. It became Public Law No: 100–449.

==Effects==
The exact ramifications of the agreement are hard to measure. Trade between Canada and the U.S., which had already been on the rise, increased at an accelerated rate after the agreement was signed. While throughout the 20th century, exports fairly consistently made up about 25% of Canada&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP), since 1990 exports have been about 40% of GDP. After 2000, they reached nearly 50%.

A 2016 paper estimates &quot;that CUSFTA increased the yearly profits of Canadian manufacturing by 1.2%&quot;. A 2024 study found that Canadian workers adjusted smoothly to the effect of trade liberalization with the United States: workers in sectors that faced import competition with the US were likely to suffer modest negative economic outcomes in the short-run but they made up for this by switching to jobs in Canadian economic sectors that benefitted on easier access to the US market.

Often, analyses of the free trade agreement find that its effects on the two countries depend on the difference in value between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar. In 1990–1991, the Canadian dollar rose sharply in value against the US dollar, making Canadian manufactured goods much more expensive for Americans to buy and making American manufactured goods much cheaper for Canadians, who no longer had to pay high duties on them.

The phenomenon of &quot;cross-border shopping&quot;, where Canadians would make shopping daytrips to US border towns to take advantage of tariff-free goods and a high Canadian dollar, provided a mini-boom for these towns. The loss of many Canadian jobs, particularly in the Ontario manufacturing sector during the recession of the early 1990s, was attributed (fairly or not) to the Free Trade Agreement.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the Canadian dollar fell to record lows in value to against the US dollar. Cheaper Canadian primary products such as lumber and oil could be bought tariff-free by Americans, and Hollywood studios sent their crews to film many movies in Canada due to the cheap Canadian dollar (see &quot;runaway production&quot; and &quot;Hollywood North&quot;). The removal of protective tariffs meant that market forces, such as currency values, have a greater effect on the economies of both countries than they would have with tariffs.

The agreement has failed to liberalize trade in some areas, most notably the ongoing dispute over softwood lumber. Issues such as mineral, fresh water, and softwood lumber trade still remain disputed.

While the agreement remains decades later, it is no longer at the forefront of Canadian politics. It was superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, which itself was replaced by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement in 2020. The Liberals under Jean Chrétien were elected to office in the 1993 election, partly on a promise to renegotiate key labor and environmental parts of NAFTA. An agreement was indeed struck with the Democrats under Bill Clinton that created separate side deals to address both of these concerns.

<doc id="399766" wikidata="Q1481220" url="?curid=399766" title="Mount Thielsen">
<text>Mount Thielsen (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct shield volcano in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive activity ceased 250,000 years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano&#x27;s structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational activities such as skiing and hiking. Thielsen is one of Oregon&#x27;s Matterhorns.

Thielsen was produced by subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Volcanism near the Cascades dates back to 55 million years ago (mya), and extends from British Columbia to California. Thielsen is part of the High Cascades, a branch of the main Cascades range that includes several Oregon volcanoes less than 3.5 million years old; it is also a member of a group of extinct volcanoes distinguished by their sharp peaks.

The area surrounding the volcano was originally inhabited by Klamath Native Americans, and was later encountered by settlers. One of the visitors was Jon Hurlburt, an early explorer of the area who named the volcano after the engineer Hans Thielsen. Later explorers discovered nearby Crater Lake. The volcano was not analyzed until 1884, when a team from the United States Geological Survey sampled its fulgurite deposits.

== History ==

The area was originally inhabited by Chinook Native Americans, who referred to the mountain as &quot;Hischokwolas&quot;; the Klamath call it &quot;hisc&#x27;akwaleeas&quot;. Jon Hurlburt, a Polish explorer, renamed the volcano after Hans Thielsen, a railroad engineer and builder who played a major role in the construction of the California and Oregon Railroad.

In 1884 a United States Geological Survey team headed by J. S. Diller began studying the mountains of the Cascade Range. Their intended destinations included Thielsen, which was climbed and sampled for its fulgurite variant. Thielsen&#x27;s spire-like top is hit by lightning so frequently that some rocks on the summit have melted into a rare mineraloid known as lechatelierite, a variety of fulgurite. The mountain has earned the nickname &quot;the lightning rod of the Cascades&quot;.

Apart from study, Thielsen and the rest of the Crater Lake area features heavily into 19th- and early 20th century exploration. In 1853, miners from Yreka first described Crater Lake; one called it &quot;the bluest water he had ever seen&quot;, another &quot;deep blue lake&quot;. The first published description was written by Chauncy Nye for the &quot;Jacksonville Sentinel&quot; in 1862. Nye recalled an expedition of gold prospectors where they passed a lake of a deep blue color. Native Americans lived in the area and grew irritable towards new settlers in the area. In 1865, Fort Klamath was built as a protective sanctuary. A wagon road was built to connect the Rogue Valley to the fort. In late 1865, two hunters ventured upon the lake; more explorers followed. By then, the lake became famous for its distinctive color, and crowds flocked to see it. The first known non-Native American to stand on the shore of Crater Lake was Sergeant Orsen Stearns, who climbed down into the caldera. A friend, Captain F.B. Sprague, gave it the name &quot;Lake Majesty&quot;. Tourism continued until May 22, 1902; on that day, Theodore Roosevelt designated the lake and surrounding area a national park.

== Geography ==

=== Regional ===

The Cascade Range was produced by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36 million years; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent volcanism within the last 10,000 years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California&#x27;s Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different from state to state, the volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. Volcanic peaks of the Cascade Mountains are grouped into two ranges, called the &quot;High Cascades&quot; and the &quot;Western Cascades&quot;; Thielsen is part of the High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades.

=== Local ===

Diamond Lake, formed by one of Thielsen&#x27;s eruptions, lies to the west of Mount Thielsen and beyond lies Mount Bailey, a much less eroded and younger stratovolcano. Thielsen&#x27;s sharp peak is a prominent feature of the skyline visible from Crater Lake National Park. All three volcanoes are part of the Oregon High Cascades, a range that sections off the stratovolcanoes of Oregon that are younger than 3.5 million years. The High Cascades include Mount Jefferson, the Three Sisters, Broken Top, and other stratovolcanoes and remnants.

Rock in the area ages from the Upper Pliocene and Quaternary. Basalt and basaltic andesite comprise newer volcanoes atop the High Cascades: Major volcanic centers include Mount Hood, Three Sisters / Broken Top, Mount Mazama (Crater Lake), and Mount Jefferson. All have produced diverse eruptions, including both lava flows and pyroclastic eruptions, and variability in composition between dacite, basalt, and even rhyolite (except for Mount Hood, which is not known to have produced rhyolite). Thielsen is part of a series of extinct volcanoes in Oregon termed pyramidal peaks or &quot;the Matterhorns&quot; for their steep, spire-like summits; Thielsen is the highest at . Other Matterhorns include Mount Washington, Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. Unlike other mountains in the High Cascades, all these volcanoes became extinct 250,000–100,000 years ago, and their summits endured the last few ice ages, accounting for their distinct shapes.

== Geology ==

Thielsen has been so deeply eroded by glaciers that there is no summit crater and the upper part of the mountain is more or less a horn. Thielsen is a relatively old Cascade volcano, and cone-building eruptions stopped relatively early. Erosion caused during the last two or three ice ages remains visible. Subsidence of the last material in Thielsen&#x27;s crater moved its youngest lava more than above the active crater.

On the mountain past lava flows are diverse, some as thick as , others as thin as . Stack-like figures composed of breccia and past flow deposits are as thick as . The placement of these flows suggest that they were generated by spatter emitted by fountains in the cone. On the sides of the mountain are bands of palagonite, a clay formed from iron-rich tephra making up the body of the volcano. Basalt taken from the volcano contained pyroxene, hypersthene material, and feldspars.

Other notable formations in the vicinity include Hemlock Mountain, Windigo Butte, and Tolo Mountain. Other than Crater Lake, little water flows on the surface, but small streams have formed in canyons excavated by glaciers.

=== Composition ===
The volcanic cone of Mount Thielsen sits atop prior shield volcanoes, and has a volume of . The cone was built from basaltic andesite, a common component of other shield volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades, breccia, and tuff, and it is intruded by dikes. A coalesced volcanic cone, it formed as pyroclastics erupted and fountains spewed lava. Glaciers cut and deformed the cone, eroding its upper sector. This erosion opened the interior of Thielsen for observation. Within the cone, lava flows, pyroclastic flow deposits, and strata of tephra, and volcanic ash, are easily visible. Potassium-argon dating of deposits in the cone suggests that Thielsen is at least 290,000 years old. Since its eruption stopped about 250,000–100,000 years ago, the period of eruptive activity was short in time. The eruptions of the cone came in three phases: a period where lava flows built up its cone, one where more explosive pyroclastic eruptions took place, and the final period, in which pyroclastic and material of lava-based origin were erupted together forming a weak cone encircled by long deposits.

=== Glaciation ===
Glaciers were present on the volcano until the conclusion of the Little Ice Age, at the beginning of the 20th century. Pleistocene glaciers have largely eroded Thielsen&#x27;s caldera, exposing its contents. The last glacier on the mountain, the small Lathrop Glacier located in the northern cirque, melted at some point after 2016. Whilst the glaciation was previously extensive, volcanic ash from eruptive activity at Mount Mazama has almost certainly masked contents.

=== Fulgurites ===
Fulgurites (substances that form when lightning melts rock) on the volcano are restricted to the very pinnacle of the mountain, and are only found between the top and of its summit. Lightning strikes the summit regularly, creating patches of &quot;brownish black to olive-black glass&quot; that resemble &quot;greasy splotches of enamel paint&quot;. These range from a few centimeters in diameter to long, narrow lines up to long. Their appearance also varies: While some patches are rough and spongy, others are flat. Inspection of the fulgurite reveals a homogenous glass over a layer of basalt; in between, a stratum made of materials such as feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine exists.

== Ecology ==

A grove of enormous incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, and there is a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest&#x27;s rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.

The lower slopes of Mount Thielsen are heavily forested, with low diversity of plant species. A forest of mountain hemlock and fir grows up to the timberline at about . Near the peak of the volcano, whitebark pine prevails.

== Recreation ==
Mount Thielsen lies in the southern section of the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, which is part of the Deschutes, Umpqua and Fremont–Winema national forests. On the west, the wilderness borders the Oregon Cascades Recreation Area, a area set aside by Congress in 1984. The wilderness and forests offer several activities related to the mountain, such as hiking and skiing. The wilderness covers around the volcano, featuring lakes and alpine parks. It also contains of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, accessible from a trailhead along Oregon Highway 138. In 2009 the trail was selected as Oregon&#x27;s best hike. Three skiing trails exist on the mountain, all of black diamond rating. They follow several trails through the wilderness from the bowl of the mountain.

<doc id="399768" wikidata="Q1950367" url="?curid=399768" title="Mount Bailey (Oregon)">
<text>Mount Bailey is a relatively young tephra cone and shield volcano in the Cascade Range, located on the opposite side of Diamond Lake from Mount Thielsen in southern Oregon, United States. Bailey consists of a -high main cone on top of an old basaltic andesite shield volcano. With a volume of , Mount Bailey is slightly smaller than neighboring Diamond Peak. Mount Bailey is a popular destination for recreational activities. Well known in the Pacific Northwest region as a haven for skiing in the winter months, the mountain&#x27;s transportation, instead of a conventional chairlift, is provided by snowcats—treaded, tractor-like vehicles that can ascend Bailey&#x27;s steep, snow-covered slopes and carry skiers to the higher reaches of the mountain. In the summer months, a hiking trail gives foot access to Bailey&#x27;s summit. Mount Bailey is one of Oregon&#x27;s Matterhorns.

Native Americans are credited with the first ascents of Bailey. Spiritual leaders held feasts and prayer vigils on the summit.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the mountain&#x27;s name is a matter of dispute. Older maps show its name as either &quot;Old Baldy&quot; or &quot;Old Bailey&quot;, &quot;Bailey&quot; possibly being a drafting error. The summit&#x27;s bald, burnt-over appearance might indicate the origin of the designation &quot;Baldy&quot;. No record of a person named Bailey who was connected with the peak has been found. In 1992, the Oregon Geographic Names Board voted to name the mountain in honor of naturalists Vernon and Florence Bailey. According to William G. Steel, the Klamath name for the mountain was &quot;Youxlokes&quot;, which means &quot;Medicine Mountain&quot;. According to Klamath tradition, their medicine men and priests would feast on the mountain&#x27;s summit and commune with the upper world.

== Geography and geology ==
Mount Bailey is part of the High Cascades in the western United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, glaciation. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.

Mount Bailey heads the Mount Bailey chain, which consists of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes. Built around the same time as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano is no more than 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak&#x27;s current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to andesite.

Bailey is comprised by a central tephra cone, upon which basaltic andesite eruptions 
streamed over, building up to create the current volcano. Eventually switching to andesite, it may have been built over several eruptions or even eruptive periods, judging from the silicic nature of its rock. It is currently inactive, having been since approximately the time Mount Mazama became active, sometime in the early Pleistocene epoch.

== Ecology and recreation ==

Diverse flora exists on Mount Bailey. Starting at the lower slopes, the prominent tree type is standard pine, eventually changing to a landscape of mountain hemlock, western white pine, and Shasta fir.

Bailey is a popular hiking and skiing site, due to its steep climbs and views of Diamond Lake. It is accessible from Oregon Route 230, starting at the Fox Spring trailhead. Following the Mount Bailey Trail, part of the Diamond Lake Recreational Area, hikers can see &quot;panoramas to the northeast of Diamond Lake and Bailey&#x27;s dizzying avalanche bowl&quot;. To skiers, the peak is known for its method of transportation, featuring snowcats.

<doc id="399771" wikidata="Q7243720" url="?curid=399771" title="Prinair Flight 191">
<text>Prinair Flight 191 was a Prinair (Puerto Rico International Airlines) flight from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Mercedita Airport in Ponce, Puerto Rico. At approximately 11:15pm on June 24, 1972, the aircraft crashed while attempting to land at Mercedita Airport. Five people died in the accident and the remaining people were injured.

== Aircraft and crew ==
The flight was operated by a de Havilland DH.114 Heron 2B aircraft, registration number N554PR. The aircraft was almost fully loaded, with eighteen passengers and a crew of two on board. The flight was under the command of Captain Donald Price (28), a very experienced airman who had clocked approximately 8,300 total flight hours, more than 3,000 of which were accrued in the aircraft type. The first officer was Gary Belejeu (27). Far less experienced than the captain, Belejeu had logged roughly 1,400 total flight hours, with 102 hours in the DH-114.

== Flight and accident ==
The flight was uneventful up to the moment of landing. As the flight was late at night, the control tower at Mercedita Airport was closed, therefore the flight crew was responsible for the landing clearance. Just after touching down on the runway at Mercedita Airport the flight crew made a decision to go around. The pilot over-rotated the aircraft and caused it to stall at a low level and crash; three passengers and the two flight crew members died, the other fifteen passengers were injured, seven severely. Heavy fog was also a contributing factor in this accident.

== Investigation ==
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation concluded that the probable cause was the &quot;presence of an unauthorized vehicle on the runway which caused the pilot to attempt a go-around after touchdown to avoid a collision. The maneuver resulted in an overrotation of the aircraft at too low an airspeed to sustain flight&quot;. This was based on eyewitness accounts of a set of lights visible on the runway as Flight 191 approached, and other eyewitness accounts of a vehicle owned by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority being parked shortly after the accident and the driver acting in a suspicious manner.

Three years after the accident the NTSB was compelled to re-open the investigation into the crash, after submissions were received that the person who was suspected of driving the &quot;unauthorized vehicle&quot; had actually left the airport about fifteen minutes before the aircraft crashed. The second investigation concluded that there was no airport vehicle on the runway, and that the reason for the go-around of the aircraft was unknown; a new report was issued, explaining the evidence as to the location of the airport vehicle and amending the Probable Cause to remove reference to a vehicle being on the runway.

Its historic centre is Milton Keynes Village, the village that in 1967 gave its name to the city of which it is now a small part. It is delineated by Childs Way to the north, Tongwell Street to the east, Chaffron Way to the south and Brickhill Street to the west. The River Ouzel runs diagonally through it, from west to north.

==History==

The village was originally known as Middeltone (11th century); then later as Middelton Kaynes or Caynes (13th century); Milton Keynes (15th century); and Milton alias Middelton Gaynes (17th century). After the Norman invasion, the de Cahaines family held the manor from 1166 to the late 13th century as well as others in the country (Ashton Keynes in Wiltshire, Somerford Keynes in Gloucestershire, and Horsted Keynes in West Sussex). During this time the village became known as Middleton Keynes,&lt;ref name=&quot;CP40/800&quot;&gt; See last paragraph, at the start of line 5, &quot;Middelton Keynes&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; eventually shortening to &#x27;Milton Keynes&#x27;.

The original core village of the district, along Walton Road and Broughton Road, has retained its &quot;Milton Keynes&quot; road signs and has several rural village houses and a thatched pub which dates back to the 13th century. It is now known as &quot;Milton Keynes Village&quot;.

==Education==
Middleton has two schools, Middleton Primary School and Oakgrove School, a secondary comprehensive. Both were built in the early 2000s, in the southwest of the district.

==Civil parish==
Early in the development of Milton Keynes (the city), the area surrounding Milton Keynes (the village) was given the name Middleton again. However, the civil parish is still called Milton Keynes, and has a joint parish council with Broughton, called Broughton and Milton Keynes Parish Council. Milton Keynes civil parish consists of Middleton and the neighbouring grid-squares of Oakgrove, Fox Milne and Pineham. (The city centre has its own civil parish, called &quot;Central Milton Keynes&quot;.)

<text>Celestia is a real-time 3D astronomy software program that was created in 2001 by Chris Laurel. The program allows users to virtually travel through the universe and explore celestial objects that have been catalogued. Celestia also doubles as a planetarium, but the user is not restricted to the Earth&#x27;s surface, like in other planetarium software such as Stellarium. Celestia can display objects of various scales using OpenGL.

Celestia is available for AmigaOS 4, Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Xbox, iOS, VisionOS, and Android. It is free and open source software released under the GNU General Public License.

Celestia&#x27;s development stopped in 2013, with the final release in 2011. Since then, some of its development team went to work on celestia.Sci, a cosmological visualizer featuring more realistic rendering of galaxies and planets, gravitational lensing, and many other scientifically accurate enhancements, but there have been no updates on the progress of the program since 2020. The original creator of Celestia, Chris Laurel, created Fifth Star Labs shortly after Celestia&#x27;s development stopped, and began working on a planetarium app called Sky Guide. In late 2016, the official Celestia forums were restored, and development restarted under a new development team. As of 2018, beta testing builds of version 1.7.0 are available. Celestia was ported to mobile devices in 2020, and in 2024 the same developer ported it to the Apple Vision Pro.

Celestia is available for download from its main website, celestiaproject.space, but it can be obtained from a multitude of free software websites as well. Between 2001 and May 2017, the former central distribution site SourceForge counted approximately 12 million downloads.

==Functions==
Celestia versions 1.6.4 and under display the Hipparcos Catalogue (HIP) of 118,322 stars and a compiled catalogue of galaxies, while version 1.7.0 includes stars from the Tycho-2 Catalogue alongside the Hipparcos stars, with some data from Gaia, increasing the star count to over 2 million. Celestia uses the VSOP87 theory of planetary orbits to provide a solar and lunar eclipse finder and to display the orbital paths of planets (including extrasolar planets), dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, artificial satellites, and spacecraft.

Using the installed catalogues, the names of celestial objects can be displayed, including artificial satellites. The names and locations of Earth features such as continents, mountains, seas, oceans, and cities can also be displayed. Surface features on other celestial objects such as craters, basins and canyons can be shown as well.

Celestia allows users to navigate at different speeds, and allow users to orbit stars, planets, moons, and other space objects, track space objects such as spacecraft, asteroids, and comets as they fly by, or travel to and/or fly through galaxies. Light time delay is an optional function.

The time simulated by Celestia can be set to any time 2 billion years forward or backward from the present, although planetary orbits are only accurate within a few thousand years of the present day, and 

Celestia simulates the appearance of atmospheres on planets and moons, planetshine on orbiting satellites, and miscellaneous planetary details such as sunrise and sunset. Information about the objects that Celestia draws can also be displayed, such as temperature, distance from observer, radius, rotational period, luminosity, and more.

The user can change Celestia&#x27;s field of view, and the window can be split into multiple different panes, meaning that several objects can be displayed on the screen at once. Screenshots and movies can be captured in classic or HD resolutions. Celestia&#x27;s support for gamepads and joysticks is relatively limited.

Celestia can be extended with new objects, and has support for third-party, user-created add-ons available for installation, both fictional and realistic. Add-ons are commonly made up of plain text files, textures, and occasionally 3D models. Celestia also uses the custom CEL scripting language, and improved CELX scripts written in the Lua programming language, which can execute many different commands.

==Limitations==

The default setting for Celestia&#x27;s Earth is a spheroid. The irregular surface of the Earth causes low Earth orbit satellites to appear to be in the wrong places in the sky when watched from the surface, even when the Earth&#x27;s oblateness is specified, as Celestia does not simulate 3D surfaces.

Many types of astronomical objects are not included with Celestia. Variable stars, supernovae, black holes, and nebulae are missing from the standard distribution. Many of these are available as add-ons.

Although objects that form part of a planetary system move, and stars rotate about their axes and orbit each other in multiple star systems, stellar proper motion is not simulated, and galaxies are at fixed locations. As a result, the constellations in Celestia do not gradually change shape as they do in the real world. In addition, Celestia&#x27;s binary star catalogs only describe a few hundred systems of multiple stars. Most binary star systems cannot be simulated with 100% accuracy because adequate orbital information is not yet available.

Celestia does not include any stars that are more than a few thousand light-years from the Sun because the parallaxes of more distant stars are too small to be accurately measured by the Hipparcos astrometric satellite. However, with the addition of Gaia data in 1.7.0, stars as far away as the Galactic Center are included. In addition, objects in star systems are only drawn to a distance of one light-year from their parent stars, any further and they will simply not be rendered at all. Similarly, there is a render limit for stars at 10 million light-years in versions 1.6.3 and under, increased to 1 billion light-years in 1.7.0. Any stars beyond that limit are not rendered, and stars that are close to the 1.7.0 render limit experience floating point errors, meaning their position is inaccurate. Finally, Celestia does not consider the wobbling of some stars induced by their planets, unless said wobbling is very noticeable.

Wavelength filtering is not implemented in Celestia&#x27;s engine. The actual rendering tries to match human vision at the observer&#x27;s position as accurately as possible. This means false-color maps and multi-color nebulae are not part of the official distribution, but many are available as add-ons. Camera artifacts such as lens flare and glare are not rendered.

Celestia also does not simulate gravity. For example, a near-Earth object approaching the Earth will not be deflected by the Earth&#x27;s gravity unless the person who defined the NEO&#x27;s trajectory for Celestia included that effect.

Some moons do not cast shadows on their planet during eclipses. This is because irregularly shaped objects do not cast shadows in the current version of Celestia, although this is planned for future versions. Additionally, moons smaller than 0.5% of their parent objects&#x27; size do not cast shadows at all, as the original development team decided that they would be too small to be relevant. However, the new development team has considered removing this hard-coded limit.

Most real-world spacecraft such as &quot;Voyager 2&quot; are not available in Celestia but are provided as add-ons by users. Additionally, most of the spacecraft included with Celestia 1.6.3 use outdated or low-quality models, such as the stock Mir model which is very basic and barely detailed, and the stock ISS model which hasn&#x27;t had an update since around 2007, meaning it is missing a lot of modules that have been added to the ISS since then. However, there are many add-ons that replace these models with higher-quality and more up-to-date ones. Fortunately, version 1.7.0 will include better models upon its final release.

Celestia uses the Julian calendar and cannot go back or forward more than 2 billion years, and the default time-setting system cannot go further than the years -9999 or 9999.

==Add-ons==

Well over 80 GB of extensions are available in addition to the base program, produced by an active user community.

Higher resolution surface textures are available for most Solar System bodies, including Virtual Textures with coverage up to 65536 pixels wide (0.625 km/pixel at the Earth&#x27;s equator), with selected coverage at higher resolutions. This allows closer views of well-mapped objects that have high-resolution VTs available for download. 3D models of historical and existing spacecraft are available flying in reasonably accurate trajectories, such as Sputnik 1, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the International Space Station, as are extended data plots for stars (2 million with correct spatial coordinates), DSOs (nebulae, galaxies, open clusters, etc.), as well as catalogs of asteroids and comets, and more than 96,000 locations on the Earth can be drawn by the program. Add-ons also include other objects such as red and blue supergiants, red and brown dwarfs, neutron stars, spinning pulsars, rotating black holes with accretion disks, protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, star nursery nebulae, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, galactic redshifts, geological planetary displays (e.g. 3D interiors, topographic and bathymetric maps, paleogeography), planetary aurorae, rotating magnetic fields, animated solar prominences, 3D craters and mountains, and historic collision events (Either spacecraft such as &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and DART, or meteoric impacts such as the Chelyabinsk meteor).

Numerous scripts are available. These include simple tours, reconstructions of complex space missions such as &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, and scripts showing useful information, like size comparisons, or particular events such as multiple simultaneous eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s moons or the evolution of a star.

Fictional universes can be depicted, with planetary systems and 3D models—films such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and TV shows including &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Add-ons illustrating less well-known internet fiction, like &quot;Orion&#x27;s Arm&quot;, or role-playing games, like 2300 AD, and personal works by members of the Celestia community depicting fictional planetary systems with inhabited worlds, spacecraft, cities, and special effects can also be added.

Educational add-ons can also be implemented in different languages. These activities provide approximately 40 hours of space journeys and astronomical lessons to include extensive tours of the Celestia universe, the complete life cycle of stars, the Solar System, the human space program, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and depictions of astronomical events such as the formation of the Moon billions of years ago, and the possible terraforming of Mars in the future. 

In mid 2016, a large addon pack project called Celestia Origin was created, which replaces all vanilla textures and graphics with higher-quality renderings, adds more minor objects such as TNOs and asteroids, while also adding more extrasolar planets with custom textures, more nebulae with full 3D and accurate models, more stars and galaxies, more star clusters, more spacecraft, and a ton of more enhancements. In 2019, Celestia Forum member FarGetaNik created an addon pack called Project Echoes, featuring higher-quality renderings that replace all vanilla textures. Celestia 1.7.0 appears to use Project Echoes as inspiration for its textures.

==Uses in media==
NASA and ESA have used Celestia in their educational and outreach programs, as well as for interfacing to trajectory analysis software. The French Space Agency (CNES) created a heavily modified version of Celestia in 2016, called VTS Timeloop, and it has since been used by multiple space agencies, including ESA and CNES themselves.

Celestia was used in the media by the CBS television show &quot;NCIS&quot; (Season 4, Episode 22: &quot;In the Dark&quot;). Character Timothy McGee explains what Celestia is and how an add-on can allow the user to store a diary within the program, as well. Textures designed by Celestia graphic artists were used in the movie &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; and the 2008 miniseries &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. Celestia has also appeared on the Science Channel&#x27;s &quot;Through the Wormhole&quot;. Eurogamer&#x27;s Jim Rossignol named &quot;Celestia&quot; among a top 20 list of &quot;Summer of PC&quot; Freeware games in 2006.

<text>Europanto is a macaronic language concept with a fluid vocabulary from European languages of the user&#x27;s choice or need. It was conceived in 1996 by Diego Marani (a journalist, author and translator for the European Council of Ministers in Brussels) based on the common practice of word-borrowing usage of many European languages. Marani used it in response to the perceived dominance of the English language; it is an emulation of the effect that non-native speakers struggling to learn a language typically add words and phrases from their native language to express their meanings clearly.

The main concept of Europanto is that there are no fixed rules—merely a set of suggestions. This means that anybody can start to speak Europanto immediately; on the other hand, it is the speaker&#x27;s responsibility to draw on an assumed common vocabulary and grammar to communicate.

Marani wrote regular newspaper columns about the language and published a novel (&quot;Las Adventures des Inspector Cabillot&quot;) using it. As of 2005 he was no longer actively promoting it.

== Origin of the name ==
The language&#x27;s name &quot;europanto&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Europa&quot; (the word for Europe in some European languages) and the Greek root &quot;παντώς-&quot; (&quot;pantos-&quot;; in English &quot;all&quot;, &quot;whole&quot;) and bears an intentional similarity with the name of the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language, Esperanto.

== Language code ==
The ISO 639-3 standard draft used to have the code codice_1 for this constructed language, but it was retired on 16 January 2009, with the reason “Nonexistent”. For this reason, it is also not a valid language subtag for BCP 47 as it was not registered in the IANA Language Subtags Registry (waiting for a decision for the deletion request that was initiated in 2008, but also because ISO 639-3 was still a draft, as well as RFC 5646 which was still not published to allow importing standard ISO 639-3 codes in this registry on 29 July 2009).

<doc id="399778" wikidata="Q3132652" url="?curid=399778" title="Henry Box Brown">
<text>Henry Box Brown ( – June 15, 1897) was an enslaved man from Virginia who escaped to freedom at the age of 33 by arranging to have himself mailed in a wooden crate in 1849 to abolitionists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

For a short time, Brown became a noted abolitionist speaker in the northeast United States. As a public figure and fugitive slave, Brown felt extremely endangered by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which increased the pressure to capture escaped slaves. He moved to England and lived there for 25 years, touring with an anti-slavery panorama, and becoming a magician and showman.

Brown married and started a family with an English woman, Jane Floyd. Brown&#x27;s first wife, Nancy, remained in slavery. Brown returned to the United States with his English family in 1875, where he continued to earn a living as an entertainer. He toured and performed as a magician, speaker, and mesmerist until at least 1889. The last decade of his life (1886–97) was spent in Toronto, where he died in 1897.

==Childhood and slavery==
Henry Brown was born into slavery in 1815 on a plantation called Hermitage in Louisa County, Virginia. Henry was religious from an early age, stating that his mother was the one to instill Christian values into him. He is believed to have had at least two siblings, because he mentioned a brother and a sister in his autobiography. At age 15 he was sent to work in a tobacco factory in Richmond.

In his autobiography, &quot;Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself&quot;, he describes his owner: &quot;Our master was uncommonly kind, (for even a slaveholder may be kind) and as he moved about in his dignity he seemed like a god to us, but not with standing his kindness although he knew very well what superstitious notions we formed of him, he never made the least attempt to correct our erroneous impression, but rather seemed pleased with the reverential feelings which we entertained towards him.&quot;
==Escape==
Brown was first married to a fellow slave named Nancy, but their marriage was not recognized legally. They had three children born into slavery under the &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot; principle, according to which, children born to enslaved women were themselves enslaved. Brown was hired out by his master in Richmond, Virginia, and worked in a tobacco factory. He rented a house, where he and his wife lived with their children. Brown had also been paying his wife&#x27;s master to not sell his family, but the man betrayed Brown by selling Nancy, who was pregnant at the time, and their three children to a different slave owner.a Minister in North Carolina

With the help of James C. A. Smith, a free black man, and a sympathetic white shoemaker named Samuel A. Smith (no relation), Brown devised a plan to have himself shipped in a box to a free state by the Adams Express Company, known for its confidentiality and efficiency. Brown paid (out of his savings of $166) to Samuel Smith.

Smith went to Philadelphia to consult members of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society on how to accomplish the escape, meeting with minister James Miller McKim, William Still, and Cyrus Burleigh. He corresponded with them to work out the details after returning to Richmond. They advised him to mail the box to the office of Quaker merchant Passmore Williamson, who was active with the Vigilance Committee.

To get out of work the day he was to escape, Brown burned his hand to the bone with sulfuric acid. The box in which Brown was shipped was and displayed the words &quot;dry goods&quot; on it. It was lined with baize, a coarse woolen cloth, and he carried only a small portion of water and a few biscuits. There was a single hole cut for air, and it was nailed and tied with straps. Brown later wrote that his uncertain method of travel was worth the risk: &quot;if you have never been deprived of your liberty, as I was, you cannot realize the power of that hope of freedom, which was to me indeed, an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast.&quot;

During the trip, which began on March 29, 1849, Brown&#x27;s box was transported by wagon, railroad, steamboat, wagon again, railroad, ferry, railroad, and finally delivery wagon, being completed in 27 hours. Despite the instructions on the box of &quot;handle with care&quot; and &quot;this side up,&quot; several times carriers placed the box upside-down or handled it roughly. Brown remained still and avoided detection.
The box was received by Williamson, McKim, William Still, and other members of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee on March 30, 1849, attesting to the improvements in express delivery services. When Brown was released, one of the men remembered his first words as &quot;How do you do, gentlemen?&quot; He sang a song modeled after Psalm 40, which he had earlier chosen to celebrate his release into freedom.

In addition to celebrating Brown&#x27;s inventiveness, as noted by Hollis Robbins, &quot;the role of government and private express mail delivery is central to the story and the contemporary record suggests that Brown&#x27;s audience celebrated his delivery as a modern postal miracle.&quot; The government postal service had dramatically increased communication and, despite southern efforts to control abolitionist literature, mailed pamphlets, letters and other materials reached the South.

Cheap postage, Frederick Douglass observed in &quot;The North Star,&quot; had an &quot;immense moral bearing&quot;. As long as federal and state governments respected the privacy of the mails, everyone and anyone could mail letters and packages; almost anything could be inside. In short, the power of prepaid postage delighted the increasingly middle-class and commercial-minded North and increasingly worried the slave-holding South.

Brown&#x27;s escape highlighted the power of the mail system, which used a variety of modes of transportation to connect the East Coast. The Adams Express Company, a private mail service founded in 1840, marketed its confidentiality and efficiency. It was favored by abolitionist organizations and &quot;promised never to look inside the boxes it carried.&quot;

==Life in freedom==

Brown became a well-known speaker for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and got to know Frederick Douglass. He was nicknamed &quot;Box&quot; at a Boston antislavery convention in May 1849, and thereafter used the name Henry Box Brown. He published two versions of his autobiography, &quot;Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown&quot;. The first, written with the help of Charles Stearns and conforming to expectations of the slave narrative genre, was published in Boston in 1849. The second was published in Manchester, England, in 1851, after he had moved there. While on the lecture circuit in the northeastern United States, Brown developed a moving panorama with his partner James C. A. Smith which detailed both Brown&#x27;s journey as well as the daily life of free and enslaved people. They separated in 1851.

Douglass wished that Brown had not revealed the details of his escape, so that others might have used it. When Samuel Smith attempted to free other slaves in Richmond in 1849, they were arrested. The year of his escape, Brown was contacted by his wife&#x27;s new owner, who offered to sell his family to him. Brown declined the offer. This was an embarrassment within the abolitionist community, which tried to keep the information private.

Brown is known for speaking out against slavery and expressing his feelings about the state of America. In his &quot;Narrative&quot;, he offers a cure for slavery, suggesting that slaves should be given the vote, a new president should be elected, and the North should speak out against the &quot;spoiled child&quot; of the South.

After passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which required cooperation from law enforcement officials to capture refugee slaves even in free states, Brown moved to England for safety, as he had become a known public figure. He toured Britain with his antislavery panorama for the next ten years, performing several hundred times a year. To earn a living, Brown also entered the British show circuit for 25 years, until 1875, after leaving the abolitionist circuit following the start of the American Civil War.

In 1857, as Cutter documented in her book, &quot;The Illustrated Slave&quot; (2017), Brown acted in several plays written expressly for him by a British playwright – E.G. Burton – but his acting career appears to have been short-lived. In the 1860s, he began performing as a magician with acts as a mesmerist and conjuror, under the show names of &quot;Prof. H. Box Brown&quot; and the &quot;African Prince&quot;.

While in England in 1855, Brown married Jane Floyd, a White Cornish tin worker&#x27;s daughter, and began a new family. In 1875, he returned with his new family to the U.S., with a group magic act. A later report documented the Brown Family Jubilee Singers.

==Last years, possible return to England, and death==
Brown returned to the US in 1875, and ultimately settled in Canada in the Toronto area, where he lived and worked for over a decade. Tax and Housing records indicate that he still may have been performing in the last years of his life.

As the scholar Martha J. Cutter first documented in 2015, Henry Box Brown died in Toronto on June 15, 1897. The last known performance by Brown is a newspaper account of a performance with his daughter Annie and wife Jane in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, dated February 26, 1889.

Martha Cutter also recently (2022) found two possible performances by Box Brown in England in 1896, one of which was at the Varteg School in England:

The Varteg Board School was close to overflowing on Thursday evening, when one of the grandest of entertainment was given on behalf of Mr. George Selby. . . . The programme was as follows:—Pianoforte solo, Miss Jessie Pope; duet, Misses Esse Short and A. Brace; dialogue, “Mrs. Pert and visitors,” by nine friends; organ recital, Professor Box Brown. . . . The organ recital by Prof. Box Brown has left a marked impression on the minds and ears of the people. 

Pontypool Free Press (Wales), March 20, 1896; from British Newspaper Archives. 

This information is not definitive, however, because passenger records in this period of ships returning to Canada contain few specific details about their occupants beyond first and last name and gender. 

If the performance by Brown at the Varteg school is valid, this would be the last known performance by Brown, because he died just one year later.

==Legacy==
Samuel Alexander Smith attempted to ship more enslaved people from Richmond to liberty in Philadelphia, but was discovered and arrested. As for James C. A. Smith, he too was arrested for attempting another shipment of slaves.

*&quot;The Resurrection of Henry Box Brown at Philadelphia&quot;, a lithograph by Samuel Rowse, depicted Henry Brown emerging from the shipping box into freedom in Philadelphia. The lithograph was published to help raise funds to produce Brown&#x27;s anti-slavery panorama. One of three known originals is preserved in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond.

<doc id="399781" wikidata="Q3519483" url="?curid=399781" title="Dhanraj Pillay">
<text>Dhanraj Pillay (born 16 July 1968) is a retired Indian field hockey player and former captain of the India national team. He also looks after the Air India Sports Promotion Board as a Joint Secretary based in Mumbai. For the last 5 years, Dhanraj is overseeing the SAG Hockey Academy in Gujarat funded by the Gujarat Government. He is widely regarded as one of the best Indian players of hockey.

Pillay born to a Tamil family made his debut in 1989 with the national team and in a career spanning over 15 years, appeared for India in four Olympic Games, World Cups and Champion Trophies each. He made 400 appearances for the national team and is recorded, unofficially, to have scored 170 goals. He also played for clubs in countries such as Malaysia, France, England and Germany. Recognizing his achievements, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the government of India in 2000.

==International career==
Dhanraj Pillay, whose career spanned from December 1989 to August 2004, played 400 international matches. The Indian Hockey Federation did not keep official statistics for the goals scored. There is no credible information on the number of international goals scored by Dhanraj. He scored around 171 goals in his career, according to both him and leading statisticians in the world. He is the only player to have played in four Olympics (1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004), four World Cups (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002), four Champions Trophies (1995, 1996, 2002, and 2003), and four Asian Games (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002). India won the Asian Games (1998) and Asia Cup (2003) under his captaincy. He was also the highest goal scorer in the Bangkok Asian Games and was the only Indian player to figure in the World Eleven side during the 1994 World Cup in Sydney. 

==Club Hockey==
He has also played for foreign clubs like the Indian Gymkhana (London), HC Lyon (France), BSN HC &amp; Telekom Malaysia HC (Malaysia), Abahani Limited, HTC Stuttgart Kickers (Germany) and Khalsa Sports Club (Hong Kong). Towards the end of his career, Dhanraj played in the Premier Hockey League for the Maratha Warriors for two seasons.

Dhanraj Pillay turned up for the Karnataka Lions in the World Series Hockey being played in India. He scored two goals for his team, captained by ex-India captain Arjun Halappa. He also played for Indian Airlines in Beighton Cup. He is currently the coach of the same team.

==Awards==
He is the recipient of India&#x27;s highest sporting honour, the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award for the year 1999–2000. He was awarded the Padma Shri, a civilian award in 2001. He was the captain of the 1998 Asian Games and 2003 Asia Cup winning hockey team. He was awarded the player of the tournament award in the 2002 Champions trophy held at Cologne, Germany. In 2017, East Bengal Club conferred Pillay with Bharat Gaurav award.

==Controversies==
Dhanraj is often described as mercurial and has had his share of controversies. Time and again, he has vented this ire against the Hockey Management. He was not selected for the Indian team after the triumph at the Bangkok Asiad. The official reason given was that Dhanraj and 6 other senior players were rested. But it was largely seen as a retaliation for his outburst against the management for improper reception and non-payment of match fees. He protested against the low team stipend on overseas tours before the 1998 series against Pakistan. On receipt of the Khel Ratna, Pillay commented, &quot;The award will help erase some bitter memories&quot;.

His plans to start a hockey academy at Mumbai have not taken off fully as Mumbai Hockey Association has refused to allow its astroturf facility to be used for training. He said that the academy will begin to function on October 1 but there are no signs of it right now.

==Biography==
Pillay&#x27;s biography, &quot;Forgive Me Amma&quot;, written by journalist Sundeep Misra, who tracked his career for over two decades, released in 2007.

<doc id="399783" wikidata="Q132147" url="?curid=399783" title="Sania Mirza">
<text>Sania Mirza (; born 15 November 1986) is an Indian former professional tennis player. A former doubles world No. 1, she won six major titles – three in women&#x27;s doubles and three in mixed doubles. From 2003 until her retirement from singles in 2013, she was ranked by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association as the No. 1 Indian in singles. Throughout her career, Mirza has established herself as one of the most known, highest-paid, and influential athletes in India.

In singles, Mirza had wins over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva, and Marion Bartoli, as well as former world-number-ones Martina Hingis, Dinara Safina, and Victoria Azarenka. She is the highest-ranked Indian female player ever, peaking at world No. 27 in mid-2007. However, a major wrist injury caused her to shift to doubles. Mirza has achieved a number of firsts for women&#x27;s tennis in India, including reaching the one million-US$ mark in career earnings (currently over US$7.2 million), winning a singles WTA Tour title, and winning a major title, as well as qualifying for (and eventually winning) the WTA Finals in 2014 in doubles partnering Cara Black, and defending her title the following year partnering Martina Hingis. Mirza retired from professional tennis in February 2023.

She is one of only two Indian women to win a WTA Tour title, and the only one to be ranked within the top 100 in singles. Mirza is the third Indian woman in the Open Era (after Nirupama Mankad and Nirupama Sanjeev, and the second in singles after Sanjeev) to contest and win a match at a major, and the first to advance past the second round. In doubles, Mirza won 43 titles and spent 91 weeks as world No. 1. In 2005, Mirza was crowned the Newcomer of the Year by the WTA, and in 2015 she and Martina Hingis were the Doubles Team of the Year, going on to earn a 44-match winning streak, one of the longest in history. Mirza has also won a total of 14 medals (including six golds) at three major multi-sport events, namely the Asian Games, the Commonwealth Games and the Afro-Asian Games.

Mirza was named one of the &quot;50 Heroes of Asia&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; in October 2005. In March 2010, &quot;The Economic Times&quot; named Mirza in its list of the &quot;33 women who made India proud&quot;. She was appointed as the UN Women&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia during the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November 2013. She was named in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2016 list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Mirza and Chakravarthi beat compatriots Poojashree Venkatesha and Nirupama Sanjeev to win the bronze medal.

In November, she represented India at the 2010 Asian Games. The unseeded Indian defeated Venise Chan in the first round.

During the grass-court season Mirza lost in the first rounds of the singles and doubles competition at Eastbourne.

==Playing style==
Mirza is an offensive baseliner with very powerful groundstroke and is known for setting up good attacks with the sheer velocity of her groundstrokes. Her main strength is her forehand, as well as her volleying skills. Her power game has drawn comparisons to Romanian legend Ilie Năstase. She is also a great returner of serve finding many return winners during matches. Mirza goes for winners, which means she goes for many angles. Mirza has said that &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that my forehand and backhand can match anyone, it&#x27;s about the place that they&#x27;re put in. I can hit the ball as hard as anyone can&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m not that fast on my feet&quot;, she added as her most evident weakness is her movement around the court, where Mirza usually struggles moving up and around the court. Mirza&#x27;s second serve and relatively poor mobility are often quoted as her big weaknesses. But by 2012, a series of injuries had effectively ended her singles career.

In 2006, some newspapers reported that Mirza declined to play doubles with Israeli tennis player Shahar Pe&#x27;er for fear of protests from India&#x27;s Muslim community.

On 4 February 2008, Mirza said that she would stop appearing in tennis tournaments held in India, starting with the 2008 Bangalore Open the following month, citing the series of controversies and upon advice by her manager. But Mirza chose to participate at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.

After both Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna refused to play in the men&#x27;s doubles event at the 2012 Olympics with Leander Paes, Paes demanded that he be partnered with Mirza for the mixed doubles event. Mirza accused the All India Tennis Association (AITA) of using her as &#x27;bait&#x27; to keep Paes happy as she wanted to play with Bhupathi, with whom she has won 2 grand slams. In the end, Mirza was paired with Paes and the pair lost in the quarterfinals of the mixed doubles.

Mirza, along with Sunitha Rao, was photographed violating the dress code at Beijing Olympic Opening Ceremony parade in 2008. In response, Mirza reaffirmed loyalty to the land of her birth—&quot;To see the national flag go up while standing on the podium is the proudest moment in an athlete&#x27;s life and I will want to experience that for myself in London.&quot;

Mirza was referred to as &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s daughter-in-law&quot; and unfit to be a representative of an Indian state after she was appointed the Telangana state&#x27;s brand ambassador. The comment referred to Mirza&#x27;s husband, Shoaib Malik, being a Pakistani cricketer. Telangana chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao presented Mirza with 1 crore on two occasions.
She was summoned by the tax department for non-payment of service tax on the payment received, however she responded that the 1 crore given was training incentive, and not towards becoming state&#x27;s brand ambassador.

<doc id="399787" wikidata="Q157451" url="?curid=399787" title="Heydar Aliyev">
<text>Heydar Alirza oghlu Aliyev (10 May 1923 – 12 December 2003) was an Azerbaijani politician who was a Soviet party boss in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic from 1969 to 1982, and the third president of Azerbaijan from October 1993 to October 2003. 

He was a high-ranking official in the KGB of the Azerbaijan SSR, serving for 28 years in Soviet state security organs (1941–1969). He governed Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982 as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. He held the post of First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1987. He rose through the ranks due to his close associations with Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov.

Aliyev was installed as president of Azerbaijan after the 1993 military coup ousted President Abulfaz Elchibey. Elchibey was a prominent Soviet dissident and Azerbaijani nationalist leader who had been elected as president in independent Azerbaijan&#x27;s first free election in 1992. Aliyev&#x27;s installation as president put an end to Azerbaijan&#x27;s short post-independence democratic interlude. Shortly after taking charge, Aliyev organized a presidential election where he won nearly 99% of the vote. 

His regime in Azerbaijan has been described as dictatorial, authoritarian, and repressive. He was also said to have run a heavy-handed police state where elections were rigged and dissent was repressed. A cult of personality developed around Aliyev, which has continued after his death in 2003. Shortly before his death, his son Ilham Aliyev was elected president in a fraudulent election and continues to lead Azerbaijan to this day.

== Career in the Soviet era ==

=== Early life ===

According to both his official biography and the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Aliyev was born on 10 May 1923 in the city of Nakhchivan. His family had moved to Nakhchivan before his birth from the village of Comardlı (modern-day Tanahat in the Syunik Province of Armenia), located only a few miles from Nakhchivan. Some sources claim that Aliyev was actually born 2 years earlier in Comardlı, but that it was later decided that a senior Azerbaijani politician should not have an Armenian place of birth. His father was from Comardlı and his mother was from Vorotan (also in modern-day Syunik Province of Armenia). Aliyev had four brothers: Hasan, Huseyn, Jalal, and Agil, as well as three sisters: Sura, Shafiga and Rafiga.

After graduating from the Nakhchivan Pedagogical School, Aliyev attended the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute (now the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University) from 1939 to 1941, where he studied architecture. In 1949 and 1950, he studied at the USSR Ministry of State Security Higher School in Leningrad. Aliyev&#x27;s official biography also states that he studied at Baku State University, graduating with a degree in history in 1957. According to American journalist Pete Earley, Aliyev first attended the Ministry of State Security Academy in Leningrad and graduated in 1944. He also took Senior Staff Professional Development courses at the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow in 1966.

In 1948, Aliyev married Zarifa Aliyeva. On 12 October 1955, their daughter Sevil Aliyeva was born. On 24 December 1961, their son Ilham was born. Zarifa Aliyeva died of cancer in 1985.

=== Early career ===

During World War II, he served as commander of a Smersh battalion, which conducted intelligence operations on the Soviet Union&#x27;s own forces and executed soldiers who deserted or fought insufficiently hard. 

He joined the Azerbaijan SSR People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security (NKGB) in 1944 and proceeded to become the department head of the State Security Committee of Azerbaijan SSR in 1950, after he graduated from the Senior Staff Training School of the USSR State Security Committee. 

In 1954, as part of a government reform, the NKGB, which was previously named the Ministry of State Security (MGB), was again renamed, this time as the KGB. Sources point to Aliyev working in the Azerbaijani KGB&#x27;s Eastern Division, which included Iran and the Middle East. During this time, Aliyev was a close associate of Semyon Tvsigun. Aliyev became head of the Azerbaijani KGB in 1960 and eventually received the rank of major general. During his time in Soviet secret service, Aliyev was mostly unknown in Azerbaijan.

== From KGB to leader of Azerbaijan SSR ==
Aliyev was elected First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party at its Plenary Session held on 12 July 1969. He was reportedly selected for the job by Brezhnev after his friend Semyon Tsvigun, Brezhnev&#x27;s brother-in-law, advocated for Aliyev&#x27;s selection.

Aliyev subsequently dominated affairs in Soviet-era Azerbaijan. Described as the &quot;Monarch of Azerbaijan&quot;, Aliyev established an extensive patronage network across Azerbaijan and profited on the black market. According to Harold James Perkin, Aliyev was &quot;surrounded by female ‘volunteers’ whose services were mainly sexual.&quot; 

In his obituary, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;He made a name for himself by smashing local mafia groups, but his personal circle moved in to profit off oil, caviar and other sectors.&quot; Aliyev was selective in his anti-corruption campaign, as he targeted those that refused to cooperate with him but rewarding and elevating those that did. 

Aliyev frequently treated Brezhnev with lavish gifts. The gifts include a ‘Sun-king’ diamond ring worth 226,000 roubles and a jewel-encrusted framed portrait to Brezhnev. Aliyev built a palace for Brezhnev&#x27;s personal use for his official visit in 1982.

He promoted individuals from his native Nakhichevan to leadership positions in the Azerbaijan SSR. He also promoted Azerbaijani culture and language. 

In the early 1980s, Aliyev barred the children of certain legal personnel from attending the republic&#x27;s law school, in a purported effort to curb a self-perpetuating elite based on corruption.

Aliyev was subsequently promoted to the Moscow Politburo in 1976.

== Career in Moscow ==
Aliyev became a candidate (non-voting) member of the Soviet Politburo in 1976. He held this position until December 1982, when Yuri Andropov promoted him to the office of First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers and made him a full member of the Politburo. Aliyev also served at the Council of Ministers as the first deputy chairman in 1974–1979. 

Aliyev supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. At the 1981 Party Congress, Aliyev praised Brezhnev profusely.

On 22 November 1982, Andropov promoted Aliyev from a candidate to a full member of the Soviet Politburo and appointed him to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, responsible for transportation and social services. Aliyev thus attained the highest position ever reached by an Azerbaijani in the Soviet Union.

Aliyev was dismissed from his position as First Deputy Premier and from the Politburo by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, officially on health grounds, but the two had fallen out over Gorbachev&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign. Aliyev had fallen out with Gorbachev and was one of the gold guard cleared out as part of Gorbachev&#x27;s Perestroika.

== Fall and re-invention ==
After his forced retirement in 1987, Aliyev remained in Moscow until 1990. He suffered a heart attack during this time. Aliyev publicly opposed the January 1990 Soviet military crackdown in Baku, which had followed the continuing conflict regarding Nagorno-Karabakh.

Almost immediately after this public appearance, Aliyev left Moscow for his native Nakhchivan. There, Aliyev reinvented himself as a moderate nationalist. He was elected the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR in Baku in October 1990. Under the pressure and criticism from groups connected to his nemesis, the leader of Soviet Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutallibov, Aliyev again returned to Nakhchivan, where he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Nakhchivan in 1991. He resigned that same year from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

By December 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved and Azerbaijan formally became an independent state, Aliyev independently governed Nakhchivan in spite of Mutallibov&#x27;s presidency. Early 1992 saw increased violence in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War following the fall of Shusha, the last Azerbaijani-populated town in Nagorno-Karabakh. These events resulted in Mutallibov&#x27;s resignation and the subsequent rise to power of the Azerbaijan Popular Front led by Abulfaz Elchibey. Elchibey was elected as president in Azerbaijan&#x27;s first free and fair elections in 1992.

During Elchibey&#x27;s one year in power, Aliyev continued to govern Nakhchivan without any deference to the official government in Baku. The attempt by the Popular Front&#x27;s Minister of Interior Isgandar Hamidov to forcibly overthrow Aliyev in Nakhchivan was thwarted by local militia at the regional airport. During the same period, Aliyev independently negotiated a cease-fire agreement in Nakhchivan with the then-President of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrosyan.

Aliyev was elected as the leader of New Azerbaijan Party at its constituent congress organized in Nakhchivan on 21 November 1992.

=== 1993 Azerbaijani coup ===
In 1993, Elchibey was ousted from power in a Russia-backed military coup led by Surat Huseynov, a military commander that Elchibey had fired. Aliyev was installed as President, and Aliyev in turn appointed Huseynov as prime minister. According to historian Audrey Altsadt and Thomas de Waal, Aliyev did not appear to have a direct role in the coup. In August 1993, Elchibey was stripped of his presidency by a nationwide referendum. 

Aliyev disbanded 33 battalions loyal to Elchibey&#x27;s Popular Front party. Amid this turmoil, Azerbaijan lost enormous swaths of territory to Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and had effectively lost the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

== Presidency ==

On 3 October 1993, Aliyev organized the 1993 Azerbaijani presidential election where he allowed two unknown candidates to run against him. He was elected President of the Republic of Azerbaijan with 98.8 percent of the vote. On 11 October 1998, he was re-elected, winning 77 percent of the vote. Aliyev was nominated as a candidate in the 2003 presidential elections, but declined to run in the elections in connection with health problems.

=== Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ===

==== Final year of war ====
When Aliyev became chairman of the Supreme Soviet in June 1993, Azerbaijan was suffering from internal division and military collapse, which allowed Armenian forces to capture most of five districts in the southwest of Azerbaijan without meeting significant resistance, leading to the displacement of around 350,000 people. After taking the office of president, Aliyev disbanded units loyal to the ousted Azerbaijani Popular Front and ordered the creation of a new national army. Tens of thousands of young men with no fighting experience were conscripted to this end. At the same time, Aliyev conducted negotiations with the Armenian side: he had already confidentially met with Karabakh Armenian leader Robert Kocharyan twice in Moscow soon before assuming the presidency, and Armenian and Azerbaijani representatives had agreed to prolong a ceasefire in September 1993. The negotiations bore no results and the ceasefire did not hold, however, and Armenian forces captured additional territories soon after Aliyev&#x27;s inauguration. In the winter of 1993–1994, Azerbaijani forces attempted to recapture territories on different parts of the frontline. While Azerbaijani forces managed to recapture part of Fuzuli District, the operation to retake Kalbajar District was a disastrous failure, with thousands of Azerbaijani soldiers killed or frozen to death in the mountains north of Kalbajar.

==== 1994 ceasefire and peace negotiations ====

In May 1994, with Aliyev&#x27;s approval, a ceasefire agreement was signed by representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia and the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which successfully put an end to the hostilities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. While agreeing to the ceasefire, Aliyev rejected Russian proposals to deploy a peacekeeping contingent to Nagorno-Karabakh. Following the ceasefire, Aliyev periodically engaged in negotiations with the Armenian side mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group and its co-chair countries (Russia, France and the United States) for the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. At the OSCE Lisbon Summit in December 1996, all of the OSCE member states except for Armenia signed a declaration affirming Azerbaijan&#x27;s territorial integrity and stating that Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s right to self-determination should be realized in the form of &quot;the highest degree of self-rule within Azerbaijan&quot;.

Aliyev reportedly agreed to a &quot;phased solution&quot; to the conflict proposed by the Minsk Group co-chairs in September 1997, which envisioned the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh (besides the Lachin District) and the deployment of international peacekeepers, followed by negotiations on the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh in subsequent phases; the proposal was never realized as Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosyan failed to win support for it from his own government and was forced to resign in February 1998. Aliyev participated in bilateral talks with the new president of Armenia, Robert Kocharyan, in spring 1999 and again in January 2001. Further, more substantial talks were held in Key West, Florida with American mediation in April 2001. The proposals negotiated at Key West have never been published, although it is reported that Nagorno-Karabakh and the Lachin Corridor were to be effectively ceded to Armenia while Azerbaijan would regain the seven occupied districts and receive land access to Nakhchivan through Armenian territory. Despite initial reports that the two sides were closer than ever to coming to a final agreement, Aliyev, who is said to have met significant opposition to the conditions from his inner circle, declined to go forward with the agreement after returning to Azerbaijan. The Key West negotiations were the last major negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict during Aliyev&#x27;s presidency.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Constitutional reform ====
Aliyev assembled the Constitutional Commission in June 1995 to create a constitution to replace the 1978 Azerbaijan SSR Constitution. The first draft was ready in October for public debate and the final version consisted of 5 chapters, 12 sections and 147 articles. The new constitution was confirmed by a referendum held on 12 November 1995. To ensure separation of power, the constitution created 3 divisions: legislative (Milli Majlis), executive (President) and judicial (courts).

Aliyev suggested amendments to the Constitution of Azerbaijan in June 2002. The first amendment to the Constitution of Azerbaijan was approved as the result of the 2002 Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, which was married by fraud. Consequently, 39 amendments to 23 articles of the Constitution of Azerbaijan were made. These included the abolition of proportional party-list elections to Parliament, a change in the presidential line of succession to favor the Prime Minister instead of the Chairman of Milli Majlis, the favoring of a simple majority when calculating presidential election results, and the establishment of rights for citizens, courts and ombudsmen to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan.

==== Repression of veterans groups ====
Aliyev perceived the military as a threat to his rule. Many of the military commanders from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict were imprisoned by his government. When war veterans from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict protested against his government, the government arrested many of them and shut down the veterans rights organization.

==== Abolition of death penalty ====
Aliyev requested the elimination of the death penalty on 3 February 1998. Milli Majlis approved the draft law on 10 February 1998. As a result, capital punishment was replaced with life imprisonment. Azerbaijan joined the &quot;Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty&quot; on 22 January 1999.

==== Agrarian and land reform ====

Agrarian reforms implemented during the Aliyev administration can be divided into 2 phases:

* 1995–1997 – During the first phase, the legislative base for an agrarian sector was reestablished through the adoption of a number of legislative documents. Privatization of Azerbaijani agriculture through the dissolution of the traditional collective and state farms was the focus of these laws. Examples of these laws include &quot;the Basis of Agrarian Reform&quot; (18 February 1995); &quot;Reform of state and collective farms&quot; (18 February 1995); and &quot;Land Reform&quot; (16 July 1996). On 10 January 1997 Aliyev issued a Decree on &quot;Approval of some legal documents assuring implementation of agrarian reforms&quot;. The State Commission on Agrarian Reforms was formed by Aliyev on 2 March 1995.
* 1998–2001 – The second phase focused on post-privatization support and the removal of bureaucratic barriers for more effective implementation of these reforms. The Ministry of Agriculture was reorganized by a presidential decree dated 6 June 1998 (On Ratification of the Statue on the Ministry of Agriculture), the law on &quot;State land cadaster, land monitoring and structure&quot; (22 December 1998), a decree on &quot;Land rent&quot; (12 March 1999), and a law on &quot;land market&quot; (7 May 1999). The Land Code of Azerbaijani Republic was approved by the Law on &quot;Approval of Land Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot; (25 June 1999).

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Relations with United Nations ====
During Aliyev&#x27;s presidency, Azerbaijan began actively participating within international organizations such as the United Nations. Aliyev attended the 49th session of the UN General Assembly (UN GA) in 1994 and the special session of UN GA dedicated to 50th anniversary of United Nations in October 1995. He received former Secretary General of UN Boutros Boutros-Ghali in October 1994 in Baku. Aliyev met with Secretary General Kofi Annan during his trip to the US in 1997 July. Aliyev addressed the Millennium Summit of UN held in September 2000, where he talked about the Armenian invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent regions, and mentioned UN resolutions 822, 853, 874, 884, which demanded unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from the occupied Azerbaijani territories. After 11 September attacks, Azerbaijan joined the anti-terror coalition of UN and cooperated with Office of Counter-Terrorism and Sanctions Committee of the UN SC. In October 2001, Azerbaijan joined the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism adopted by UN SC in 1999.

==== Relations with NATO ====
The Partnership for Peace (PfP) Framework Document was signed to enhance security and defense cooperation with NATO on 4 May 1994. Aliyev approved the PfP Presentation Document on 19 April 1996. In November 1997, Azerbaijan joined the PfP Planning and Review Process. NATO PA also made Azerbaijan an associate member of NATO in November.

==== Relations with EU ====
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Azerbaijan was signed in Luxembourg on 22 April 1996, and went into effect on 22 June 1999. It promises cooperation in the fields of trade, investment, economy, legislation, culture, immigration and the prevention of illicit trade. Azerbaijan received assistance from the EU for economic reforms in the country through the TACIS and TRACECA programmes. The “Restoration of the Historic Silk Road” international conference was organized in Baku on 8 September 1998 by Aliyev and President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia with the support of the TACIS and TRACECA programmes.

==== Relations with Council of Europe ====
Azerbaijan participated as a specially invited guest at the Council of Europe (CoE) on 28 June 1996. Consequently, a number of resolutions and legal acts were adopted from 1996–2001 to improve the Azerbaijani legislative system so it could fulfill the requirements of European standards and international law. On 28 June 2000, Azerbaijan&#x27;s full admission to the CoE was recommended at the session of Parliamentary Assembly of the CoE. Azerbaijan became a full member of the CoE on 17 January 2001; the official ceremony was conducted on 25 January 2001. Presidential orders “On the implementation of the measures of the program of cooperation between the Council of Europe and the Republic of Azerbaijan” (8 July 1996), &quot;On the measures of Deepening Cooperation between the Council of Europe and the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot; (20 January 1998), and “On the measures of expanding cooperation between Azerbaijan and CoE for defending interests of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Council of Europe&quot; (14 May 1999) were adopted by Aliyev.

==== Relations with Russia ====
Aliyev prioritized establishing warmer relations with Russia more than the previous leadership of Azerbaijan did. He stated in his speech at Milli Majlis on 15 June 1993, after being elected as the head of Parliament of Azerbaijan: &quot;Russia, our northern neighbor, is absolutely a vast state. Undoubtedly, the relation based on independent principles between Azerbaijan and Russia must be better, broader and more fruitful.&quot; The Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Security between Russia and Azerbaijan was signed on 3 July 1997. Aliyev paid his first official trip to Russia as a President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in July 1997 with the invitation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Relations with Russia further developed through Aliyev-Putin negotiations during their bilateral visits (Vladimir Putin visited Azerbaijan in 2001 and Aliyev paid a reciprocal visit to Russia in 2002). The agreements on &quot;The Status and Benefiting Principles of Gabala Radio Location Station&quot;, &quot;Long term economic cooperation agreement between Russian Federation and the Azerbaijan Republic until the year 2010&quot;, and &quot;The common declaration of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev&quot; were signed in the latter meeting.

==== Relations with US ====
Establishing closer relations and developing cooperation with the US were among the main goals of Aliyev&#x27;s foreign policy. He stated in one of his speeches regarding this issue: “The relations of Azerbaijan with the United States are important as we need to learn the Western democracy, culture, achievements, to benefit from them, to use and apply them in Azerbaijan. In this regard, the United States is a special country for us.&quot; Relations between the two countries strengthened after oil contracts were signed. Aliyev paid his first official visit to the US and met with President Bill Clinton on 1 August 1997. They signed a Joint Statement on future relations between the US and Azerbaijan in defense and military issues. During this trip (27 July-5 August 1997), a statement on intentions of formation of bilateral dialogue between the US and Azerbaijan regarding energy issues and the general agreement between the Government of the Azerbaijani Republic, the National Bank, and the US Export-Import Bank on the promotion of projects were signed. Additionally, 4 agreements on development and production sharing for the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea were signed. After the visit, Aliyev issued an order on “Measures to expand partnership relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the United States” on 2 September 1997. Azerbaijan joined a US-lead international coalition against terrorism after 11 September attacks, and sent a military contingent to Afghanistan. An amendment to the Freedom Support Act was adopted on 24 October 2002 by the US Senate to allow a US president to temporarily waive Section 907, which used to forbid to export any financial or humanitarian support to Azerbaijan.

=== Oil strategy ===
Aliyev used the oil potential of Azerbaijan to avoid the difficulties his country faced after the collapse of the Soviet Union by attracting foreign investment into Azerbaijan. After a year-long series of negotiations in Baku, Istanbul and Houston, the “Agreement on the Joint Development and Production Sharing for the Azeri and Chirag Fields and the Deep Water Portion of the Gunashli Field in the Azerbaijan Sector of the Caspian Sea” was signed in Baku on 20 September 1994 by the Government of Azerbaijan and a consortium of 11 oil companies from 6 countries (US, UK, Russia, Norway, Turkey, Saudi Arabia) in the presence of Aliyev.

The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan was established by Presidential Decree in December 1999 to gather the income gained from oil profit with the aim of financing social and economic projects. As a result of the oil strategy developed by Aliyev, Azerbaijani oil was planned to be carried through different routes as Baku–Supsa, Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (BTC), etc. In order to export Azerbaijani oil to the European market, the presidents of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey agreed to construct the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in 1998 in Ankara. The ground-breaking ceremony of BTC took place in September 2002 with the participation of Aliyev, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and Georgian President Edward Shevardnadze.

The decision to export Azerbaijani crude oil to the Port of Novorossiysk was made through a contract signed in Moscow on 18 February 1996. Oil transportation through this route was realized in October 1997. Establishment of the alternative Baku–Supsa route was agreed on 8 March 1996 by Aliyev and Shevardnadze. The Baku–Supsa route began operation in April 1999.

== Death and successor ==
Aliyev&#x27;s health began to fail in 1999 when he had a major heart bypass operation in the United States at the Cleveland Clinic. He later had prostate surgery and a hernia operation. He collapsed while giving a speech on live television in April 2003. On 6 August, Aliyev returned to the US for treatment of congestive heart failure and kidney problems. He did not return to Azerbaijan again. 

Less than two weeks before the 2003 Azerbaijani presidential election, he withdrew his candidacy and appointed his son Ilham as his party&#x27;s sole presidential candidate. On 12 December 2003, President Aliyev died at the Cleveland Clinic. He was given a large state funeral and buried at the Alley of Honor cemetery in Baku.

Heydar Aliyev&#x27;s son Ilham Aliyev won a presidential election on 15 October 2003 widely considered to have been fraudulent. International observers criticized the contest as falling well below expected standards.

== Honours ==


Throughout his life, Aliyev was awarded a number of state orders and medals, international awards, and elected honourable doctor of universities in many countries. Awards he has received include the Order of Lenin five times, the Order of the Red Star once, and Hero of the Socialist Labor twice. On 27 March 1997 in Kyiv, Ukraine, Aliyev received Ukraine&#x27;s highest award, the Yaroslav Mudry Order, and on 13 April 1999, Turkey&#x27;s highest honour, the Atatürk International Peace Prize. On 3 April 2003, he was elected a professor and authorized member of the Academy of Safety of the Russian Federation, and was subsequently awarded the Premium of Yuri Andropov. On 10 May 2003, he was decorated with the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-Called—Russia&#x27;s supreme award. A statue of Aliyev has been unveiled in a Tašmajdan Park in Belgrade; its renovation was aided by 2 million euros ($2.9 million) from the Azerbaijani government. In August 2012 a statue of Aliyev which had been gifted to Mexico by the Azerbaijani embassy was installed in a park in Mexico City but was removed the following January after proving controversial. On April 10, 2023, Heydar Aliyev Street was opened in the center of Astana, the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan took part in the opening ceremony.

<doc id="399791" wikidata="Q1627887" url="?curid=399791" title="H. L. Gold">
<text>Horace Leonard Gold (April 26, 1914 – February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, and also wrote briefly for DC Comics.

==Life and family==
H. L. Gold was born on April 26, 1914 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Gold was born Jewish, and there are claims that he at first had to write under pseudonyms because publishers feared the readers&#x27; potential antisemitism. He was drafted into the United States Army during World War II, serving in the Pacific War. As a result of trauma during his wartime experiences, he developed agoraphobia which became so severe that for more than two decades he was unable to leave his apartment. Towards the end of his life, he acquired some control over the condition.

His marriage to Evelyn Stein ended in divorce in 1957, and his second marriage was to Muriel &quot;Nicky&quot; (Nicholson) Conley. He died in 1996.

His brother Floyd C. Gold, writing under the pen name Floyd C. Gale, was the primary book reviewer for &quot;Galaxy&quot; from 1955 to 1963. His son E. J. Gold is an artist, writer, and musician.

==Author and editor==

===Science fiction===
After becoming editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot; Gold wrote that as a &quot;dazzled boy&quot; he &quot;discovered science fiction in 1927, at the age of 13&quot;:

During the 1930s, Gold unsuccessfully wrote stories for pulp magazines. The day he was fired from his regular job because his boss believed that a writer should not work as a busboy, Gold learned that he had made his first sale. Beginning with &quot;Inflexure&quot; (as Clyde Crane Campbell) in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (October 1934), Gold later worked for Standard Magazines, Fawcett Comics and Timely Comics. He used the Campbell pen-name for his first half-dozen or so stories in 1934/35. When he resumed his writing career in 1938 he took the billing Horace L. Gold, but soon shortened it to the now more familiar H. L. Gold.

Gold&#x27;s most noted stories tended more toward fantasy, like his &quot;Trouble with Water&quot; (Unknown, March 1939). In 1939–41 he was an assistant editor on a trio of science fiction magazines – &quot;Captain Future&quot;, &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Startling Stories&quot;. His 1939 novel, &quot;None But Lucifer&quot; in &quot;Unknown&quot; (September 1939) was a collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp.

===Comics and World War II===
During the early 1940s, Gold teamed with Kendell Foster Crossen on comic book scripts, freelancing with DC Comics writing for &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Superboy&quot;, &quot;Boy Commandos&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; from &quot;roughly the end of 1942&quot; until World War II interrupted his career. He was drafted in 1944, although he was Canadian, flatfooted, overage and had a newborn child. He returned on compassionate leave (possibly in May 1946) to be at his dying father Henry&#x27;s bedside in Fall River, Massachusetts. He had been offered directorship of Armed Forces Radio postwar, which he declined. After serving, he returned to New York City, where he scripted for comic books and radio programs. Gold&#x27;s story &quot;The Old Die Rich&quot; (&quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, March 1953), written at the same time as Marcia Davenport&#x27;s &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, may have been inspired by the &quot;New York Times&quot; articles about the Collyer brothers as was Davenport&#x27;s novel. Gold often found story ideas in newspaper clippings.

==&quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Beyond&quot;==

H. L. Gold is perhaps best known as a leading magazine editor during the American post-World War II science fiction boom. In 1949 he began in that direction, and launched &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1950, which was soon followed by its companion fantasy magazine, &quot;Beyond Fantasy Fiction&quot; (1953–55).

Gold&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy&quot; &quot;made a startling impact on the world of science fiction&quot;, successor Frederik Pohl said in 1965, with &quot;&quot;wit&quot; and &quot;relevance&quot;&quot;; &quot;It is difficult to exaggerate that impact&quot;. Some writers saw Gold as &quot;a sort of slave-driver&quot; but, Pohl said, &quot;as one of the most frequently flogged of the slaves ... the results were worth it&quot;. With &quot;Galaxy&quot; Gold created a different kind of science fiction magazine by focusing less on technology, hardware and pulp adventures. Instead, he introduced themes leaning toward sociology, psychology and satire. He paid more than was common at the time and had the advantage that several talented authors had become alienated from John W. Campbell due to his enthusiasm for Dianetics.

Gold also edited several anthologies (1952–62) related to the magazine. He suffered from increasing agoraphobia (originating from war trauma), and retired from &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1961 due to his health problems. Gold lived the rest of his life in seclusion, though he published occasional short stories and guest editorials through the early 1980s.

==Collected stories==
His collection &quot;The Old Die Rich&quot; (Crown, 1955) includes &quot;And Three to Get Ready&quot;, &quot;At the Post&quot;, &quot;The Biography Project&quot; (as Dudley Dell), &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It to Heart&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Love in the Dark&quot; (also known as &quot;Love Ethereal&quot;), &quot;Man of Parts&quot;, &quot;The Man with English&quot;, &quot;No Charge for Alterations&quot;, &quot;The Old Die Rich&quot;, &quot;Problem in Murder&quot; and &quot;Trouble with Water&quot;. While Anthony Boucher praised Gold as &quot;almost the only s.f. writer capable of creating lower and lower-middle class background,&quot; he found that the stories &quot;are simply not up to the standards of craftsmanship&quot; that Gold set as an editor.

<text>Herbert Hupka (August 15, 1915 – August 24, 2006) was a German journalist, politician (SPD and later the CDU), and advocate for the Germans expelled from neighbouring countries after the Second World War.

==Early life==

Hupka was born in a British internment camp in Diyatalawa, Sri Lanka, to a Silesian German Catholic professor Erich Hupka and a Jewish-German Lutheran mother Sara Rosenthal. Herbert Hupka grew up in Ratibor, Upper Silesia (Free State of Prussia, Germany). In his younger years Hupka was raised in the Catholic religion and close to the democratic Catholic Zentrum party. After having served in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; at the Eastern Front, and after having completed his Habilitation, Hupka was expelled from the Wehrmacht in August 1944 for being a &quot;half-Jew&quot; because his mother was Jewish; she survived deportation to and internment in Theresienstadt concentration camp. Following World War II their Upper Silesian hometown became part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and Hupka and his mother were expelled to West Germany.

==Politics and Expellee Issues==

Hupka was a member of the Bundestag from 1969 to 1987. He was also president of the Eastern German Culture Council () and vice-president of the Federation of Expellees (&quot;Bund der Vertriebenen&quot;).

The expellees&#x27; issues formed the kernel of his political activities. He was the chairman of the &quot;Landsmannschaft Schlesien&quot; from 1968 to 2000. He was also chairman of the &quot;Eastern German Culture Council&quot; and vice-chairman of the Federation of Expellees from historical eastern Germany. Hupka had opposed the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; initiated by Willy Brandt and carried on by further SPD and even (later) CDU-led administrations. These policies subscribed to the acceptance of the territorial changes that took place after the Second World War; this line explicitly denied all attempts to regain these territories and former provinces, which had become parts of Poland or the Russian SFSR. Herbert Hupka, on the other hand, spoke in favour of incorporating the territories into a unified, future German state. His opinions, which were regarded as revanchist, made him unpopular not only with the left, as he opposed the recognition of the Oder-Neiße border with the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. On 29 February 1972, Hupka crossed the floor from the Bundestag faction of the SPD to the CDU/CSU faction. Nevertheless, in 1985 CDU-leader and federal chancellor Helmut Kohl also refused to speak at the Landsmannschaft Schlesien&#x27;s annual conference unless its theme, &quot;Schlesien bleibt unser&quot; (&quot;Silesia remains ours [i.e. German]&quot;) was changed to a less controversial theme. Hupka was one of the Landsmannschaft&#x27;s members who refused to change the theme, thereby conflicting heavily with Kohl, leader of the CDU. In the end he agreed to change the name to &quot;Silesia remains our future in a common Europe of free nations&quot;.

Hupka, once the target of Polish and Soviet communist (and nationalist) propaganda, was later employed as an advisor by the local government of present-day Silesia and was awarded the title of an honorary citizen of Racibórz, the historic town of his youth.

* Diego was a formerly-enslaved freedman closely associated with the Elizabethan English navigator Francis Drake. In March 1573, Drake raided Darien (in modern Panama), in which he was greatly aided by Maroons – Africans who had escaped from Spanish slave owners and were glad to help their English enemies. One of them was Diego, who proved a capable ship builder and accompanied Drake back to England. In 1577, when Queen Elizabeth sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas – which eventually developed into Drake circumnavigating the world – Diego was once again employed under Drake; his fluency in Spanish and English would make him a useful interpreter when Spaniards or Spanish-speaking Portuguese were captured. He was employed as Drake&#x27;s servant and was paid wages, just like the rest of the crew. Diego died while Drake&#x27;s ship was crossing the Pacific, of wounds sustained earlier in the voyage. Drake was saddened at his death, Diego having become a good friend.

He lived with the family in Amsterdam until his death in 1629 and was buried in the Beth Haim cemetery, oldest Jewish cemetery in the Netherlands. He appears to have been set free, either &quot;de jure&quot; or in practice, and to have been on near equal footing with the family that owned him back in Portugal – indicated by the fact that he attended the funeral of the wife of his master, Sara de Pina, and contributed to that occasion six stuivers, and that he was buried alongside his (former) owners and alongside Jacob Israel Belmonte, the community&#x27;s richest businessman. Elieser must have been converted to Judaism and widely accepted as Jewish, otherwise he would not have been buried inside the Jewish cemetery; the name &quot;Elieser&quot; was likely bestowed on him at conversion, recalling Eliezer of Damascus. In recent years, Elieser&#x27;s memory was taken up by members of the Surinamese community in the Netherlands, who erected a statue of him and hold an annual pilgrimage to his grave on what came to be known as &quot;Elieser Day&quot;.

<text>A somersault (also &quot;flip&quot;, &quot;heli&quot;, and in gymnastics &quot;salto&quot;) is an acrobatic exercise in which a person&#x27;s body rotates 360° around a horizontal axis with the feet passing over the head. A somersault can be performed backwards, fowards or sideways and can be executed in the air or on the ground. When performed on the ground, it is typically called a roll.

== Etymology ==

The word &#x27;somersault&#x27; is derived from Old Provençal &quot;sobresaut&quot; (via Middle French &quot;sombresault&quot;) meaning &quot;jump over&quot;, from &quot;sobre&quot;, &quot;over&quot; (from Latin &quot;supra-&quot;, as in &quot;supranational&quot;); and &quot;saut&quot;, &quot;jump&quot; (from Latin &quot;saltus&quot;, the same root as &quot;salient&quot;).

== Types ==


===Body positions===
Somersaults may be performed with different positions, including tucked, piked (bent at the hips), straddled, and layout (straight body). Somersaults are often completed with twists.
===Direction===
The sport of tumbling does not require participants to combine both front and back elements, and most tumblers prefer back tumbling as it is easier to build momentum.

Arabian saltos begin backwards, continue with a half twist to forwards, and end with one or more saltos forwards. They can be trained by beginning with an Arabian dive roll and adding a front salto to it. They are counted as front tumbling in women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics and back tumbling in men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics.
===Multiple rotations===
By 2003, the tucked double back salto had become common in women&#x27;s gymnastics. The triple back salto exists in men&#x27;s gymnastics but was rarely competed until 2017.

In 2019, American gymnast Simone Biles was the first woman to compete a back triple double: two saltos backwards with three twists in a tucked position.

<text>Sam Moskowitz (June 30, 1920 – April 15, 1997) was an American writer, critic, and historian of science fiction.

== Biography ==
As a child, Moskowitz greatly enjoyed reading science fiction pulp magazines. As a teenager, he organized a branch of the Science Fiction League. While still in his teens, Moskowitz became chairman of the first World Science Fiction Convention held in New York City in 1939. He barred several members of the rival Futurians club from the convention because they threatened to disrupt it. This event is referred to by historians of fandom as the &quot;Great Exclusion Act&quot;.

In the mid-1940s, Moskowitz founded the Eastern Science Fiction Association (ESFA), a science-fiction fandom organization based in Newark, New Jersey which held conventions. By the early 1950s, he began working professionally in the science fiction field. He edited &quot;Science-Fiction Plus&quot;, a short-lived genre magazine owned by Hugo Gernsback, in 1953. He compiled about two dozen anthologies, and a few single-author collections, most published in the 1960s and early 1970s. Moskowitz also wrote a handful of short stories (three published in 1941, one in 1953, three in 1956). His most enduring work is likely to be his writing on the history of science fiction, in particular two collections of short author biographies, &quot;Explorers of the Infinite&quot; and &quot;Seekers of Tomorrow&quot;, as well as the highly regarded &quot;Under the Moons of Mars: A History and Anthology of &quot;The Scientific Romance&quot; in the Munsey Magazines, 1912–1920&quot;. His exhaustive cataloging of early sf magazine stories by important genre authors remains the best resource for nonspecialists.

He also taught a course with Robert Frazier.

Theodore Sturgeon, although noting the book&#x27;s many imperfections, praised &quot;Explorers of the Infinite&quot;, saying &quot;no one has surveyed the roots of SF as well as Mr. M.; probably no one ever will; prossibly , no one else can.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;Seekers of Tomorrow&quot;, Algis Budrys wryly noted that &quot;Moskowitz is a master of denotation. He wouldn&#x27;t know a connotation if it snapped at his ankle, which is something that happens quite often.&quot; He added, however, that &quot;Moskowitz knows and transmits, at least as much about the history of science fiction and its evolution, as anyone possibly could.&quot;

Moskowitz&#x27;s works include also &quot;The Immortal Storm&quot;, a historical review of internecine strife within fandom. Moskowitz wrote it in a bombastic style that made the events he described seem so important that, as fan historian Harry Warner Jr. quipped, &quot;If read directly after a history of World War II, it does not seem like an anticlimax.&quot; Floyd C. Gale wrote in his review of the book that &quot;[f]ortunately, most of these petulant warriors have since grown up—but their historian is still leading their ghostly legions that are more real than today to him. The miracle is that S-F survived even the love of its most rabid fans&quot;. Anthony Boucher noted that &quot;never has so much been written about so little,&quot; but added that the book was &quot;a unique document not without a good deal of social and psychological value.&quot;

Moskowitz was also renowned as a science fiction book collector, with a tremendous number of important early works and rarities. His book collection was auctioned off after his death.

As &quot;Sam Martin&quot;, he was also editor of the trade publications &quot;Quick Frozen Foods&quot; and &quot;Quick Frozen Foods International&quot; for many years.

First Fandom, an organization of science fiction fans active before 1940, gives an award in Moskowitz&#x27; memory each year at the World Science Fiction Convention.

Moskowitz smoked cigarettes frequently throughout his adult life. A few years before his death, throat cancer required the surgical removal of his larynx. He continued to speak at science fiction conventions, using an electronic voice-box held against his throat. Throughout his later years, although his controversial opinions were often disputed by others, he was recognized as a leading authority on the history of science fiction.

<text>Republicrat or Demopublican (also Repubocrat, Demican, Democan, and Republocrat) are portmanteau names for both of the two major political parties in the United States, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, collectively. These derogatory names first appeared in the 1872 United States presidential election.

The terms have multiple meanings. One use is to insult politicians that the speaker believes are too moderate or centrist. This use is similar to saying that a Republican is a &quot;Republican in Name Only&quot; (RINO) or a Democrat is a &quot;Democrat in Name Only&quot; (DINO). Another use is to indicate that the two major parties are essentially interchangeable from the speaker&#x27;s perspective because neither major party supports the changes that the speaker wants to see. This often carries an unspoken implication that the U.S. is in spirit a dominant-party system.

==Usage==
===Insult towards moderates===
Republicans have often portrayed themselves to be pro-business and aggressive on foreign policy; Democrats have tended to campaign on more liberal social policies and a more important role for government-funded social programs. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as &quot;a member of the Democratic party esp. in the southern states who supports to a large extent the policy and measures of the Republican party&quot;. Oxford Dictionaries defines the term as &quot;[a] person whose political philosophy is a blend of policies and principles from both the Republican and Democratic parties&quot;.

The term is sometimes used in a pejorative sense by members of one party to attack members of their party who are either centrist or who have what they perceive to be the wrong ideology. Liberal Democrats have disparaged conservative and centrist members of the party, such as Senator Joe Lieberman, as Republicrats. Likewise, Republican politicians such as George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been called &quot;Republicrats&quot; due to their liberal stances on various political issues. Another term used by liberal Democrats to describe conservative and centrist members of their party is &quot;Democrat in Name Only&quot; or &quot;DINO&quot;; a conservative Republican term for liberal and centrist Republicans is &quot;Republican in Name Only&quot; or &quot;RINO&quot;.

===Argument that Democrats and Republicans are interchangeable===
Another usage of the term puts the words together in order to voice the opinion that the two mainstream American political parties are so ideologically similar as to be interchangeable. This usage often expresses the sentiment of ordinary citizens who see all politicians as serving the same special interests and make little distinction between the two parties. Earl Killian&#x27;s U.S. political glossary defines the term as &quot;a portmanteau of the words &#x27;Republican&#x27; and &#x27;Democrat&#x27; ... used to symbolize the one-party nature of U.S. politics, when it comes to issues on which the dominant parties of the two-party system agree ... . In this view ... Republicrats is then the name of the single U.S. political party, and the Republicans and Democrats are seen as factions of this one-party system, rather than as true independent parties.&quot; An example of this view comes from Noam Chomsky: &quot;The United States effectively has a one-party system, the business party, with two factions, Republicans and Democrats.&quot;

Some commentators, such as right-wing talk radio host Michael Savage and left-wing activist Ralph Nader, who have both used the terms, have opined on how it is often hard to tell the parties apart, leading to the term&#x27;s popularity. This was a view shared on the left by the Green Party during the 2000 United States presidential election, for whom Nader ran, whose bumper stickers read: &quot;Bush and Gore make me want to Ralph.&quot; Former Dead Kennedys vocalist and Green Party member Jello Biafra has used the term during interviews.

In 2004, boxing promoter Don King told Larry King he was a Republicrat. He defined it as being for &quot;whoever&#x27;s going to be doing something or the upward mobility of America, black and white alike&quot;.

==Equivalent terms in other countries==
An equivalent term used in the United Kingdom is Lib-Lab-Con or LibLabCon, a pejorative portmanteau referring to the three main political parties (the Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party, and the Conservative Party).

An equivalent term used in Canada is Lib-NDP-Con or LibNDPCon, a pejorative portmanteau referring to the three main political parties (the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party, and the Conservative Party).

An equivalent term used in Australia is Lib-Lab-Nat, a pejorative portmanteau referring to the three main political parties (the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the National Party).

All three of these epithets suggest that there are no real differences between the three major parties in the UK, Canada, or Australia, each of which is effectively a single-party system.

<text>Avram Davidson (April 23, 1923 – May 8, 1993) was an American writer of fantasy fiction, science fiction, and crime fiction, as well as the author of many stories that do not fit into a genre niche. He won a Hugo Award and three World Fantasy Awards in the science fiction and fantasy genre, a World Fantasy Life Achievement award, and an &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; short story award and an Edgar Award in the mystery genre. Davidson edited &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; from 1962 to 1964. His last novel &quot;The Boss in the Wall: A Treatise on the House Devil&quot; was completed by Grania Davis and was a Nebula Award finalist in 1998. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; says &quot;he is perhaps sf&#x27;s most explicitly literary author&quot;.

==Biography==
Davidson was born in 1923 in Yonkers, New York, to Jewish parents. He served as a Navy hospital corpsman (medic) with the Marine Corps in the Pacific during World War II, and began his writing career as a Talmudic scholar around 1950. As reported at the time in the February 20, 1962, Yonkers daily, the &quot;Herald Statesman&quot;, Rabbi Arnold Weinberger officiated at his wedding to Miss Grania Kaiman, which took place at the home of Damon Knight.

This made his conversion to Tenrikyo in the 1970s unexpected. Although he had a reputation for being quick to anger, Davidson was known among his friends for his generosity. His peripatetic life and career may have been due to a disinclination to finish what he began. His reputation among science fiction and fantasy readers peaked in the 1960s, after which he had a coterie of fans who (as with R. A. Lafferty) kept his reputation alive, especially after his death.

He was a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of Heroic Fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in Lin Carter&#x27;s &quot;Flashing Swords!&quot; anthologies.

While editing &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; he lived in Mexico, and later in British Honduras (now renamed Belize). He lived in a rural district of Novato, in northern Marin County, California, in 1970, but later moved closer to San Francisco. He lived in a small house in Sausalito, at the southern end of Marin County next to San Francisco in 1971 and 1972, and it was there fans and friends were welcomed. He worked for a short time in the late 1970s as a creative writing instructor at the University of Texas at El Paso. In his later years, he lived in Washington state, including a brief stay in the Veterans&#x27; Home in Bremerton. He died in his tiny apartment in Bremerton on May 8, 1993, aged 70. A memorial service was held in Gasworks Park in Seattle.

He was survived by his son Ethan and his ex-wife Grania Davis, who continued to edit and release his unpublished works until her own death.

==Fiction and articles==
Davidson wrote many stories for fiction magazines beginning in the 1950s, after publishing his first fiction in &quot;Commentary&quot; and other Jewish intellectual magazines.

Davidson was active in science fiction fandom from his teens. Two of his novels were nominated for a Nebula Award: &quot;Rogue Dragon&quot; (1965) and &quot;Virgil in Averno&quot; (1987). The latter follows &quot;The Phoenix and the Mirror&quot; (1969), a sequence about Vergil Magus, the magician that medieval legend made out of the Roman poet Virgil. Other speculative fiction includes the Peregrine novels, comic views of Europe shortly after the fall of Rome; the Jack Limekiller stories, about a Canadian living in an imaginary Central American country modelled after Belize during the 1960s; and the stories of Dr. Eszterhazy, an erudite Sherlock Holmesian figure living in the mythical Scythia-Pannonia-Transbalkania, the waning fourth-largest empire in Europe.

Lesser known and uncollected during his lifetime are his mystery stories, which were assembled after his death as &quot;The Investigations of Avram Davidson&quot;. These mystery stories frequently have a historical setting, and are intricately plotted. In addition, Davidson ghosted two Ellery Queen mysteries, &quot;And on the Eighth Day&quot; and &quot;The Fourth Side of the Triangle,&quot; and a true crime collection, &quot;Crimes and Chaos.&quot;

Other noteworthy works are his collaborations. In &quot;Joyleg, A Folly&quot;, written in collaboration with Ward Moore, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War (and of the Whiskey Rebellion) is found alive and very well in the Tennessee backwoods, having survived over the centuries by daily soaks in whisky of his own making to hilariously face the world of the 1960s. In &quot;Marco Polo and the Sleeping Beauty,&quot; co-written with Grania Davis, the background of Marco Polo&#x27;s travels in the Mongol Empire is borrowed for an original story. After Davidson&#x27;s death, Grania Davis also finished &quot;The Boss in the Wall&quot;, a claustrophobic horror novel that bears little resemblance to the work of any other writer.

Davidson also wrote dozens of short stories that defy classification, and the &quot;Adventures in Unhistory&quot; essays, which delve into puzzles such as the identity of Prester John and suggest solutions to them. His earlier historical essays were scrupulously researched, even when published by magazines just as happy to offer fiction as fact. Later essays were handicapped by a lack of resources in the libraries of the small towns where Davidson lived in the pre-Internet era, but are enlivened by the style and bold speculation.

Davidson&#x27;s work is marked by a strong interest in history, with his plots often turning on what at first might seem like minor events. His characterization is also unusually in-depth for fantasy, and is often enriched by his ear for unusual accents.

Davidson&#x27;s most obvious characteristics are his plotting and style. Very little may &quot;happen&quot; in a Davidson story, but he described it in detail. Hidden among the detail are facts or omissions that later become important to the outcome of the story. Especially in his later works, Davidson included elements that beginning writers are told to avoid, such as page-long sentences with half a dozen colons and semi-colons, or an apparently irrelevant digression in the opening pages of a story. He expects much from his readers, but delivers much to them.

<doc id="399805" wikidata="Q890911" url="?curid=399805" title="Keiko (orca)">
<text>Keiko ( – 12 December 2003) was a male orca captured in the Atlantic Ocean near Iceland in 1979, and widely known for his portrayal of Willy in the 1993 film &quot;Free Willy&quot;. In 1996, Warner Bros. and the International Marine Mammal Project collaborated to return Keiko to the wild. After years of being prepared for reintegration, Keiko was flown to Iceland in 1998 and in 2002, became the first captive orca to be fully released back into the ocean. On 12 December 2003, he died of pneumonia in a bay in Norway at the age of 27.

==Life==
Keiko was captured near Reyðarfjörður, Iceland in 1979 at the approximate age of two and sold to the Icelandic Aquarium in Hafnarfjörður. At the time, he was named Siggi, with the name Kago given at a later date.

In 1982, he was transferred to Marineland in Ontario, Canada. It was at this new facility he first started performing for the public. He developed skin lesions indicative of poor health, and was also bullied by an older orca. Keiko was then sold to Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico City, Mexico, in 1985. Keiko lived in a warm, chlorinated tank with artificial salt water. These conditions were more suited to dolphins, and due to this, his health continued to decline. 

At Reino Aventura, he was renamed &quot;Keiko&quot;, a feminine Japanese name that means &quot;lucky one&quot;. At the time, he was only 10 feet (3.0 m) long.

===&quot;Free Willy&quot;===
Keiko became the star of the film &quot;Free Willy&quot; in 1993. The publicity from his role led to an effort by Warner Brothers to find a better home for the orca. The pool for the now orca was only deep, wide and long. He was housed with bottlenose dolphins, but no others of his own species.
Keiko was underweight for his size, and the water temperature was often too warm, which contributed to various skin problems.
Due to a papillomavirus infection, Keiko experienced skin outbreaks, first observed while he was housed in Ontario, Canada, prior to his transfer to Mexico City,
which complicated both his candidacy for relocation and for eventual release into the wild.

=== &quot;Free Willy-Keiko Foundation&quot; ===
Outcry for Keiko&#x27;s liberation arose from the film&#x27;s credits containing a phone number for whale preservation that received hundreds of thousands of call-ins. Warner Brothers and Craig McCaw approached the International Marine Mammal Project for help. The IMMP established the &quot;Free Willy-Keiko Foundation&quot; in February 1995.
With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon was given over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of eventually returning him to the wild. Reino Aventura donated Keiko to the Foundation. Before he left the amusement park in Mexico City, Keiko performed for the public for the last time, and was seen off by thousands of children, with more onlookers watching his overnight journey to the Mexico City International Airport.
At the time he weighed about 7,700 pounds (3493 kg). A Lockheed L-100 Hercules cargo plane donated by United Parcel Service (UPS) hauled Keiko to Newport, Oregon on 8 January 1996.

On arrival in Oregon Coast Aquarium, Keiko was housed in a new () concrete enclosure containing seawater. His weight had increased significantly by June 1997, to 9,620 pounds (4364 kg).

=== Re-introduction to the wild ===
The plan to return him to the wild was a topic of much controversy. Some felt his years of captivity made such a return impossible. Researchers in a scientific study later said attempts to return him to the wild were unsuccessful, but that monitoring him with radio and satellite tags was part of &quot;a contingency plan for return to human care,&quot; which secured &quot;the long-term well-being of the animal.&quot; Others considered his release misguided.
The Norwegian pro-whaling politician Steinar Bastesen made international news for his statement that Keiko should instead be killed and the meat sent to Africa as foreign aid.

Nevertheless, the process of preparing Keiko for the wild began on 9 September 1998, when he was flown to Klettsvík, a bay on the island of Heimaey in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland. UPS again participated in transport, this time by providing ground transportation to the nearby Newport Municipal Airport. Keiko was transported in a specialized container filled with enough saltwater to cover him and cooled with ice cubes. He was then transported by air in a C-17 Globemaster airplane loaned by the U.S. Air Force. Upon landing at Vestmannaeyjar Airport, the C-17 Globemaster aircraft suffered a landing gear failure causing over $1 million in damage, though Keiko was unharmed.

His day-to-day care became the responsibility of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation with management assistance from the Ocean Futures Society. He was initially housed in a pen in the Klettsvik Bay where he underwent training designed to prepare him for his eventual release, including supervised swims in the open ocean.

Ocean Futures left the Keiko project in late 2001. The Free Willy-Keiko Foundation and The Humane Society of the United States re-established management of the project at that time until Keiko&#x27;s death in 2003. Keiko was fully free by the summer of 2002 and departed Icelandic waters in early August, following some orcas but not integrated with the pod. His journey was tracked via the signal from a VHF tag attached to the dorsal fin.
About a month later, he arrived in Norway&#x27;s Skålvik Fjord, apparently seeking contact with human beings and allowing children to ride on his back.
His caretakers relocated to Norway and continued to conduct boat-follows with Keiko for the next 15 months. On the basis of girth measurements and blood tests, it was assumed that Keiko had fed during his 900-mile (1500 km) journey from Iceland to Norway.
Keiko occasionally approached groups of wild orcas, but remained on the periphery, at distances of 100–300 meters (109 to 328 yards), with his head pointing toward the closest orca.

== Death ==
Keiko resided in Taknes Bay, which was a clear inlet of coastal water where he was free to roam. There he was fed and looked after by keepers. Keiko had a tracking device attached to his dorsal fin that allowed his four handlers to pinpoint his location as long as he stayed within range.

Although Keiko was old for an orca in captivity, male orca in the wild live up to 50-90 years. Executive director of the Free Willy-Keiko foundation stated that Keiko was relatively healthy, up until a quick onset of symptoms which consisted of lethargy and loss of appetite the day before. Dale Richards, one of his handlers, said Keiko died quickly after an irregular respiration rate was measured at age 27 on 12 December 2003. Pneumonia was determined as his cause of death.

A spokesman of the Humane Society of the United States, Nick Braden, said that veterinarians administered antibiotics to Keiko after he started showing symptoms that Thursday, however this was not enough to prevent his death.

== Evaluation of the re-introduction process ==
Most sources conclude that the project to free Keiko was a failure because the orca failed to adapt to life in the wild.
In Norway, Keiko had little contact with other orcas and was not fishing; for months before his death, the orca was being fed daily.
A report in &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes the freed orca&#x27;s life in Taknes Bay as follows: &quot;... until his death Keiko was, rather than frolicking freely in his fjord, being taken for &#x27;walks&#x27; by caretakers in a small boat at least three times a week. ... It took more than 60 failed attempts to reunite Keiko with free orcas before he followed a group where, spotting a fishing vessel off the Norwegian coast, he followed it into the fjords that would prove his final resting place.&quot;
According to an article in New Scientist, &quot;He was seen diving among the wild orcas only once, on 30 July 2002. And after physical contact at the surface, Keiko swam away, seeking out human company on the tracking boat&quot;. Simon, Hanson, Murrey, &quot;et al&quot;. (2009) confirm that he was seen on the periphery of some wild groups but was never seen to be socially integrated with such whales. In summary,
: &quot;He never integrated into a wild pod ... and could not break his need for human contact.&quot;
According to Simon &quot;et al&quot;. (2009) Keiko&#x27;s return to humans for food and for company confirms the failure of the project.

Reasons cited for Keiko&#x27;s failure to adapt include his early age at capture, the long history of captivity, prolonged lack of contact with other orcas, and strong bonds with humans.

In spite of those comments, David Phillips, executive director of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation, praised the release project: &quot;We took the hardest candidate and took him from near death in Mexico to swimming with wild whales in Norway&quot;. &quot;Keiko had five years with the sights and sounds of natural seawater. I think it was a great success in terms of Keiko, his well-being, and the whole world that wanted to do the right thing.&quot;
Others also claim that the release was a success, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called it a &quot;phenomenal success ... giving him years of health and freedom&quot;.

The total cost of freeing Keiko was about US$20 million. The lead author of the study published by &quot;Marine Mammal Science&quot; said: &quot;You can&#x27;t just let these animals out into the wild. You have to take the responsibility, and that might cost a lot of money. The fortune spent on Keiko might have been better invested in conservation programs to protect whales and their habitat ... But that&#x27;s not as appealing as the adventures of a single whale&quot;.
An alternative to freeing orcas after long-term captivity, is the use of a &quot;sanctuary&quot; or &quot;oceanic enclosure&quot; (sea pen), according to Lori Marino of the Whale Sanctuary Project.
&quot;They can&#x27;t be released, but their quality of life can be improved by orders of magnitude&quot;, Marino said in a 2016 interview where she agreed that the cost would be high ($15 to $20 million). &quot;It&#x27;s a solemn responsibility, and it&#x27;s the best we can do for animals that are in captivity.&quot;

== Filmography ==
In 2010 the film &quot;&quot; was released. In 2013 a &quot;New York Times&quot; video, &quot;The Whale Who Would Not Be Freed&quot;, included interviews about Keiko&#x27;s return to the ocean. In 2024 the &quot;New York Times&quot; released a podcast focused on Keiko titled &quot;The Good Whale.&quot;
