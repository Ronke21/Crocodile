<text>The title Hero of the Soviet Union () was the highest distinction in the Soviet Union, awarded together with the Order of Lenin personally or collectively for heroic feats in service to the Soviet state and society. The title was awarded both to civilian and military persons.

==Overview==
The award was established on 16 April 1934, by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. The first recipients of the title originally received only the Order of Lenin, the highest Soviet award, along with a certificate (грамота, &quot;gramota&quot;) describing the heroic deed from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Because the Order of Lenin could be awarded for deeds not qualifying for the title of hero, and to distinguish heroes from other Order of Lenin holders, the Gold Star medal was introduced on 1 August 1939. Earlier heroes were retroactively eligible for these items.

A hero could be awarded the title again for a subsequent heroic feat with an additional Gold Star medal and certificate. The practice of awarding additional Orders of Lenin when the title was awarded multiple times was abolished by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1988 during perestroika.

Forty-four foreign citizens were awarded the title.

The title was also awarded posthumously, though often without the actual Gold Star medal presented.

The title could be revoked only by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.

Most Soviet-bloc countries followed the Soviet example and instituted their own &quot;Hero&quot; awards. The Soviet-style &quot;Hero&quot; title is still used both in surviving current Communist states such as Cuba and in some non-Communist post-Soviet countries such as Russia, Ukraine, and others.

===Privileges===
Individuals who received the award were entitled to special privileges, including:

* A pension with survivor benefits in the event of the death of the title holder.
* Priority on the housing list with 50% rent reduction, tax exempt and an additional in living space.
* Annual round-trip first class airline ticket
* Free local public transportation
* Free annual visit to sanatorium or rest home
* Medical benefits
* Entertainment benefits

==History==
In total, during the existence of the USSR, the title of Hero of the Soviet Union was awarded to 12,777 people (excluding 72 stripped of the title for defamatory acts and 13 awards annulled as unwarranted), including 154 people who received the award twice (nine posthumously), three who received it three times, and two who received it four times. Ninety-five women were awarded the title. Among the Heroes of the Soviet Union, 44 people are citizens of foreign states. The great majority of them received it during World War II (11,635 Heroes of the Soviet Union, 101 twice Heroes, three thrice Heroes, and two four-time Heroes). Eighty-five people (28 posthumously) were awarded the title for actions related to the Soviet-Afghan War, which lasted from 1979 until 1989.

The first recipients of the award were the pilots Anatoly Liapidevsky (certificate number one), Sigizmund Levanevsky, Vasily Molokov, Mavriky Slepnyov, Nikolai Kamanin, Ivan Doronin, and Mikhail Vodopianov, who participated in the successful aerial search and rescue of the crew of the steamship &quot;Cheliuskin&quot;, which sank in Arctic waters, crushed by ice fields, on 13 February 1934. Valery Chkalov, who made the first-ever Trans-polar flight, was awarded the title on 24 July 1936. Valentina Grizodubova, a female pilot, was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union (2 November 1938) for her international women&#x27;s record for a straight-line distance flight. Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a Soviet partisan, was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II (February 16, 1942), posthumously.

According to Soviet war interpreter Elena Rzhevskaya, reports of several dead Hitler lookalikes in the days following his death stemmed from Colonel General Nikolai Berzarin&#x27;s pledge to nominate the discoverer of Hitler&#x27;s corpse for the award. (Despite Soviet claims to the contrary, only Hitler&#x27;s dental remains were ever certainly identified.)

Over 100 people received the award twice. A second Hero title, either Hero of the Soviet Union or Hero of Socialist Labour, entitled the recipient to have a bronze bust of his or her likeness with a commemorative inscription erected in his or her hometown.

Fighter pilots Aleksandr Pokryshkin and Ivan Kozhedub were three times Heroes of the Soviet Union. A third award entitled the recipient to have their bronze bust erected on a columnar pedestal in Moscow, near the Palace of the Soviets, but the palace was never completed.

After his release from serving a 20-year sentence in a Mexican prison for the assassination of Leon Trotsky, Ramón Mercader moved to the Soviet Union in 1961 and as Ramon Lopez was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Hero of the Soviet Union medal &quot;for the special deed&quot; by KGB head Alexander Shelepin.

The only individuals to receive the title four times were Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Leonid Brezhnev. The original statute of the Hero of the Soviet Union, however, did not provide for a fourth title; its provisions allowed for a maximum of three awards regardless of later deeds. Both Zhukov and Brezhnev received their fourth titles under controversial circumstances. Namely, Zhukov was awarded a fourth title in direct violation of the statute. He was awarded the fourth time &quot;for his large accomplishments&quot; on the occasion of his 60th birthday on December 1, 1956. There is some speculation that Zhukov&#x27;s fourth Hero medal was for his participation in the arrest of Lavrentiy Beria in 1953, but this was not entered in the records. Brezhnev&#x27;s four awards further eroded the prestige of the award because they were all birthday gifts, on the occasions of his 60th, 70th, 72nd and 75th birthdays. Such practices halted in 1988 due to a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which formally ended it. By the 1970s, the award had been somewhat devalued. Important political and military persons had been awarded it on the occasions of their birthdays rather than for any immediate heroic activity. All Soviet cosmonauts, starting from Yuri Gagarin, as well as foreign citizens from non-capitalist countries who participated in the Soviet space program as cosmonauts, received a Hero award for each flight, but no more than twice.

Apart from individuals, the title was also awarded to twelve cities (Hero City) as well as the fortress of Brest (Hero-Fortress) for collective heroism during the War.

==Later recipients==
The last recipient of the title &quot;Hero of the Soviet Union&quot; was a Soviet diver, Captain of the 3rd rank Leonid Mikhailovich Solodkov on 24 December 1991 for his leadership and participation in a series of unprecedented extreme depth diving experiments. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this title was succeeded in Russia by the title &quot;Hero of the Russian Federation&quot;, in Ukraine by &quot;Hero of Ukraine&quot; and in Belarus by &quot;Hero of Belarus&quot;. Azerbaijan&#x27;s successor order is that of National Hero of Azerbaijan and Armenia&#x27;s own hero medal is that of National Hero of Armenia, both modeled on the Soviet one.

<text>Daniel Francis Galouye (11 February 1920 – 7 September 1976) was an American science fiction writer. During the 1950s and 1960s, he contributed novelettes and short stories to various digest size science fiction magazines, sometimes writing under the pseudonym Louis G. Daniels.

Born in New Orleans, Galouye (pronounced Gah-lou-ey) graduated from Louisiana State University (B.A.) and then worked as a reporter for several newspapers. During World War II, he served in the US Navy as an instructor and test pilot, receiving injuries that led to later health problems. On December 26, 1945, he married Carmel Barbara Jordan. From the 1940s until his retirement in 1967, he was on the staff of &quot;The States-Item&quot;. He lived in New Orleans but also had a summer home across Lake Pontchartrain at St. Tammany Parish in Covington, Louisiana.

Richard Dawkins professes to be a fan of his works, including &quot;Counterfeit World&quot;, which inspired him to think about the concept of simulated universes.

==Novels and stories==



Galouye&#x27;s first published fiction, the novelette &quot;Rebirth&quot;, appeared in the March 1952 issue of &quot;Imagination&quot;. His work appeared in many magazines during this era including &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. Between 1961 and 1973, Galouye wrote five novels, notably &quot;Simulacron Three&quot;, basis of the movie &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; (1999) and the German TV miniseries &quot;World on a Wire&quot; (1973) (directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder). His first novel, &quot;Dark Universe&quot; (1961) was nominated for a Hugo.

According to his obituary in the &quot;New Orleans States-Item&quot;, Galouye...
:... was a Navy pilot during WWII from 1942 to 1946. He graduated from Pensacola Naval Air School, held the rank of lieutenant and was for a time during his service years in charge of a training school in Hawaii for Navy airmen. Immediately after release from the Navy, he began his career with &quot;The States-Item&quot; as a reporter, then as a copy editor and joined the editorial department in 1956. He later was named associate editor of that department, retiring in 1967. He is survived by his widow, Mrs. Carmel Barbara Jordan Galouye; two daughters, Mrs. Gerald Johan Zomerdijk of Zaandam, the Netherlands, and Mrs. Joseph Edward Ingraham of Covington; and five grandchildren.

His retirement was due to failing health, which was in turn related to injuries sustained during his Navy service. His health continued to decline until his early death at age 56. He died in New Orleans&#x27; Veteran&#x27;s Hospital and is interred at Covington Cemetery #1 in Covington.

==Awards==
In 2007, Galouye was the recipient of the Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award, which is co-sponsored by the heirs of Paul Linebarger (who wrote as Cordwainer Smith) and Readercon. The jury for this award recognizes a deceased genre writer whose work should be &quot;rediscovered&quot; by the readers of today, and that newly rediscovered writer is a deceased guest of honor at the following year&#x27;s Readercon. Galouye was named 6 July 2007 by Barry N. Malzberg and Gordon Van Gelder, speaking on behalf of themselves and the other two judges, Martin H. Greenberg and Mike Resnick.

<text>William Pierce Rogers (June 23, 1913 – January 2, 2001) was an American politician, diplomat, and attorney. A member of the Republican Party, Rogers served as the 4th Deputy Attorney-General of the United States (1953–1957) and as the 63rd Attorney-General of the United States (1957–1961) in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and as the 55th Secretary of State (1969–1973) in the administration of Richard Nixon.

Rogers was a close confidant of Nixon, but National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger overshadowed Rogers and eventually succeeded him as Secretary of State in September 1973. At the time of his death in 2001, Rogers was the last surviving member of Eisenhower&#x27;s cabinet.

==Early life and education==
Rogers was born June 23, 1913, in Norfolk, New York. After the death of his mother, the former Myra Beswick, he was raised during his teen years by his grandparents in the village of Canton, New York. He attended Colgate University, where he was initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity. He then attended Cornell Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;Cornell Law Quarterly&quot;. He received his LL.B. in 1937, graduating fifth in his class of 47 as a member of the Order of the Coif, passing the New York bar in the same year.

==Career==

After serving about a year as an attorney for a Wall Street law firm, he became an assistant district attorney in 1938 and was appointed by District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey to a 60-man task force aimed at routing out New York City&#x27;s organized crime.

Rogers entered the Navy in 1942, serving on the , including her action in the Battle of Okinawa. His final rank was lieutenant commander.

After the war, Rogers joined the United States Congress as a committee counsel. While serving on a Senate committee, Rogers examined documentation from the House Un-American Activities Committee&#x27;s investigation of Alger Hiss at the request of Representative Richard M. Nixon. He advised Nixon that Hiss had lied and that the case against him should be pursued.

On August 17, 1948, Senator Homer S. Ferguson, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on expenditures in the executive department, stated by speech and letter that the Office of the United States Attorney General had approved its espionage investigation that had started with Elizabeth Bentley on July 28. Ferguson denied that his subcommittee &quot;has in any way interfered with any criminal prosecution.&quot; Ferguson&#x27;s letter explained that counsel William P. Rogers had consulted with the Attorney General&#x27;s assistants on June 9. He stated that Rogers had &quot;advised them of our purpose and the procedure planned to be followed, the witnesses who were to be called and the questions they would be asked.&quot; That evening, Attorney General Tom C. Clark wrote a letter that contradicted Ferguson as to whether and when Ferguson&#x27;s committee had &quot;cleared&quot; its public hearings with him.

Clark&#x27;s letter stated it was &quot;incorrect&quot; that by June 9, 1948, Fergusons&#x27; subcommittee had told his office about its intention. Instead, the USAG had heard of the subcommittee&#x27;s intentions as those public hearings started on July 28. Clark wrote, &quot;It is difficult to say how much damage the efforts to arrive at a sound basis for prosecution in the espionage case has been done by the open hearings.&quot; The story broke in newspapers next day.

In 1950, Rogers became a partner in a New York City law firm, Dwight, Royall, Harris, Koegel &amp; Caskey. He thereafter returned to the firm when he was not in government service.

Rogers advised Nixon in the slush fund scandal, which led to Nixon&#x27;s Checkers speech in 1952.

===1953–1957: Deputy Attorney General===
Rogers joined the Administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower as Deputy Attorney General in 1953.

As Deputy Attorney General, Rogers had some role in or insight into the process that led to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage.

As deputy attorney general, Rogers was involved in the Little Rock Integration Crisis in the fall of 1957 of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. In that capacity, he worked with Osro Cobb, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to implement federal orders and to maintain peace in the capital city. Cobb would recall in his memoirs that Rogers called him to discuss the possibility of violence: &quot;Our conversation was somewhat guarded. I had never recommended the use of federal troops, and Rogers asked if I thought they were necessary. I told him I hoped not. Then to my surprise he stated, &#x27;They are on their way already.&#x27;&quot;

===1957–1961: Attorney General===
Rogers served as Attorney General from 1957 to 1961. He remained a close advisor to Vice President Nixon throughout the Eisenhower administration, especially during Eisenhower&#x27;s two medical crises. Rogers became attorney general upon the resignation of his superior, Herbert Brownell Jr., who had worked to implement the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School. In 1958, Little Rock closed its public schools for a year to oppose further desegregation required by the U.S. government. At the time, Rogers said, &quot;It seems inconceivable that a state or community would rather close its public schools than comply with decisions of the Supreme Court.&quot;

In 1959, Martin Luther King Jr. hailed Rogers for advocating the integration of an elementary school in Alabama that had excluded the children of black military personnel.

===1961–1969: Hiatus===
After the Eisenhower administration, Rogers returned to his law practice, now renamed to Rogers &amp; Wells, where he worked until his early eighties. He played an important role in &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; a 1964 case before the Supreme Court.

From 1962 to 1963, Rogers was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders for the economic development in Washington, DC.

===1969–1973: Secretary of State===
Rogers succeeded Dean Rusk as Secretary of State in the Nixon administration from January 22, 1969, to September 3, 1973. Nixon had long distrusted the State Department, whom he had accused under the Truman administration of being staffed with liberal diplomats who were insufficiently anti-communist and who were responsible for the &quot;loss of China&quot; in 1949. Given his dislike of the State Department, Nixon when he came into office in 1969 wanted to conduct his foreign policy via the National Security Council in a bid to marginalize the State Department.

Nixon had selected an ambitious political science professor from Harvard, Henry Kissinger, to be his national security adviser who soon emerged as his main adviser on foreign affairs. Nixon selected Rogers to be the secretary of state because he knew nothing of foreign affairs and was unlikely to assert the interests of the State Department. On Nixon&#x27;s Inauguration Day, January 20, 1969, Rogers was handed a lengthy volume containing a summary of the world&#x27;s major issues written by the State Department&#x27;s leading experts in order to brief him for his new job, leading him to remark in surprise: &quot;You don&#x27;t expect me to read all this stuff, do you?&quot; Rogers&#x27;s ignorance of foreign policy issues and his unwillingness to assert the interests of his department duly led to the State Department pushed to the sidelines under his stewardship with the major decisions taken by Kissinger with no input or even the knowledge of Rogers.

Kissinger later said of Rogers, &quot;Few secretaries of state can have been selected because of their president&#x27;s confidence in their ignorance of foreign policy.&quot;

In February 1969, Nixon began to discuss plans to bomb the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese bases just over the border in Cambodia, which Rogers felt was unwise, warning that such a bombing offensive might damage the peace talks in Paris. On March 16, 1969, Rogers attended a meeting at the White House where Nixon discussed Operation Menu, the plans to bomb Cambodia in secret. Though the State Department&#x27;s experts stated that the main source of weapons for the Viet Cong was the Ho Chi Minh Trail coming down from North Vietnam via Laos, not Cambodia, Rogers had not read their assessments. At the March 16 meeting, Rogers offered the most tepid opposition to the plan to bomb Cambodia, which began the next day.

One of his notable aims was to initiate efforts at a lasting peace in the Arab–Israeli conflict by the so-called Rogers Plan on December 3, 1969. Throughout his tenure, however, his influence was curtailed by Nixon&#x27;s determination to handle critical foreign policy strategy and execution directly from the White House through his national security adviser Henry Kissinger.

On the night of February 21, 1970, Kissinger first met in secret with the North Vietnamese diplomat Le Duc Tho in a house in Paris suburb, opening a new set of talks that were independent of the official peace talks in Paris. Kissinger only first informed Rogers of the secret talks in Paris parallel to the official talks in February 1971, a year later. On March 23, 1970, Rogers told the press that the United States had the utmost respect for the &quot;neutrality, sovereignty and independence&quot; of Cambodia, stating categorically there no plans to invade Cambodia. In the same press conference, Rogers stated: &quot;We don&#x27;t anticipate that any request will be made&quot; for help from the new Lon Nol government. Unknown to him, Nixon and Kissinger were already discussing plans to invade Cambodia. On April 30, 1970, the United States invaded Cambodia.

On October 15, 1973, Rogers received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Nixon. At the same ceremony, his wife, Adele Rogers, was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal.

==Later life==
Ronald Reagan asked Rogers to play the US president in IVY LEAGUE 82 (March 1982), a command post exercise of American nuclear forces under SIOP.

Rogers led the investigation into the explosion of the space shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. The Rogers Commission was the first investigation to criticize NASA management for its role in negligence of safety in the Space Shuttle program. Among the more famous members of Rogers&#x27;s panel were astronauts Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride, Air Force general Donald Kutyna, and physicist Richard Feynman.

Rogers worked at his law firm, now renamed Clifford Chance Rogers &amp; Wells after a 1999 merger, in its Washington office until several months before his death.

==Personal life==

Rogers married Adele Langston (August 15, 1911 – May 27, 2001), a fellow law student whom he had met at Cornell. They had four children, including Dale Rogers Marshall.

William P. Rogers died of congestive heart failure, at the Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on January 2, 2001, at the age of 87. Rogers was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 2001, the Rogers family donated to Cornell Law Library materials to reflect the lives of William and Adele Rogers, mostly from 1969 to 1973.

<text>The Nanchang Uprising was the first major Nationalist Party of China–Chinese Communist Party engagement of the Chinese Civil War, begun by the Chinese Communists to counter the Shanghai massacre of 1927 by the Kuomintang.

The Kuomintang (KMT) left wing established a &quot;Revolutionary Committee&quot; at Nanchang to plant the spark that was expected to ignite a widespread peasant uprising. Deng Yanda, Song Qingling and Zhang Fakui (listed nominally, who later crushed the uprising) were among the political leaders.

Military forces in Nanchang under the leadership of He Long and Zhou Enlai rebelled in an attempt to seize control of the city after the end of the first Kuomintang-Communist alliance. Other important leaders in this event were Zhu De, Ye Ting, and Liu Bocheng.

Communist forces successfully occupied Nanchang and escaped from the siege of Kuomintang forces by 5 August, withdrawing to the Jinggang Mountains of western Jiangxi. 1 August 1927 was later regarded as the anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) and the first action fought against the Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA).

== Order of battle ==
=== Communist forces ===
Communist forces at their peak during the Nanchang Uprising totaled over 20,000, though some of them did not join the battle until a day later. The entire Communist force was organized into the 2nd Front Army, and over half of it was under He Long&#x27;s command. He was also named Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Front Army, and Ye Ting as deputy Commander-in-Chief and acting front-line Commander-in-Chief. Communist representative was Zhou Enlai, chief of staff was Liu Bocheng and Director of the Political Directorate of the 2nd Front Army was Guo Moruo. The following is the order of battle for the Communist forces:
* 9th Army commanded by Zhou Enlai, with Zhu De as the deputy commander and Zhu Kejing (朱克靖) as the Communist Party representative.
* 11th Army commanded by Ye Ting, with Cai Tingkai as the deputy commander and Nie Rongzhen as the party representative.
** 10th Division commanded by Cai Tingkai
** 24th Division commanded by Gu Xunming/Dong Zhongming (古勋铭/董仲明)
** 25th Division commanded by Li Hanhun, and after taking Nanchang by Zhou Shidi
* 20th Army commanded by He Long and Liao Qianwu (廖乾吾) as the communist representative
** 1st Division commanded by He Jinzhai (贺锦斋)
** 2nd Division commanded by Qing Guangyuan (秦光远)
** 3rd Division commanded by Zhou Yiqun

== Battle at Nanchang ==
On the morning of 1 August 1927, at exactly 2:00 a.m., Zhou Enlai, He Long, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Ting, Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, Zhu De, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng led their troops and attacked the city of Nanchang from different directions. Four hours later they took the city, capturing 5,000 small arms and around 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition.

== Retreat ==
Facing a counterattack from the Nationalists, the Communists decided to retreat south towards the province of Guangdong. Once there they would try to take over the city of Guangzhou while spreading their influence to the peasants and farms in that area.

=== Little Long March ===
Guangzhou was the target set by the Soviet Comintern and, on August 3, Communist troops pulled out of Nanchang. Their &quot;Little Long March&quot; came to an end at the beginning of October, as they came down out of the Hakka uplands and into the Chaoshan area. In Chaozhou they were defeated by Nationalist-affiliated troops. Communist forces were broken up and traveled in two general directions, one heading to Shanwei where they engaged the Nationalists in guerrilla warfare under Peng Pai, and the other to southern Hunan, where they eventually joined a force under Mao Zedong, whose abortive Autumn Harvest Uprising had been no more successful.

The Communist forces had suffered such a decisive and disastrous defeat that only 1,000 soldiers remained as a complete unit, reforming into a regiment. Under the command of Zhu De and Chen Yi, who had faked their names, the regiment went to a local Hunan warlord and sought refuge. From this humble beginning the force eventually grew to 10,000 strong, traveling to Jiangxi and joining Mao Zedong at Jinggangshan in April 1928.

Liu Bocheng became a fugitive but was lucky enough to find other Communists who helped him and eventually sent him to the Soviet Union for military training, while Lin Biao deserted after the defeat. However, he had to return to the Communist force because of his fear that locals hostile to his side would turn him over to his enemies or kill him. Guo Moruo fled to Japan after the defeat.

Other surviving members were much less fortunate; all became fugitives. Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying and Ye Ting lost contact with the others and fled to British Hong Kong, with Zhou seriously ill. The three had two pistols with them and were successful in reaching Hong Kong. Nie Rongzhen, the other communist leader, also successfully escaped to Hong Kong.

=== He Long ===
He Long had strongly opposed the retreat plan, accurately pointing out that marching 1000 miles in the heat of summer would put a severe strain on the troops, and that popular support for the Communists in Guangdong was merely a fraction of the huge support they had among the peasantry in Hunan. His opinion was that the new Communist base should be established in the border region of Hunan, suggesting that in Hunan the Communist troops would be easily resupplied and their numbers increased by the enlistment of the local populace. However, his suggestion was vetoed.

He Long went home alone after the defeat. Demoted from his position as an army commander in charge of tens of thousands of men to that of a beggar, he was not well received by his family except for a few who were already Communists. He would soon raise another force of Communist soldiers, this time more than 3000 strong, but it would be wiped out by the Nationalists, with less than three dozen members surviving. It would take a year for He Long&#x27;s force to recover for the third time.

<doc id="400860" wikidata="Q7358154" url="?curid=400860" title="Roger Elwood">
<text>Roger Elwood (January 13, 1943 – February 2, 2007) was an American science fiction author and editor, who edited a large number of anthologies and collections for a variety of publishers during the early to mid-1970s.

==Biography==

Born and raised in southern New Jersey, Roger Elwood started his professional writing career soon after graduating from high school.

Elwood edited two magazines about wrestling, &quot;The Big Book of Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Official Wrestling Guide&quot;, on a contract basis during 1971–72 for Jalart House, an Arizona publisher, and regularly photographed matches (photographs were more important than text for wrestling magazines). He became a regular with locker room access at some shows on the East Coast, which might seem to contradict rumours that he had become disillusioned with wrestling when it came to his attention that some professional wrestling matches were fixed. This period produced some fictional confessional stories (e.g. &quot;I Killed a Man in the Ring&quot;) that Elwood claimed were based on &quot;a blending of interviews&quot;. He left the job abruptly between late 1972 and early 1973, telling writers the wrestling magazines were too much work for too little compensation.

Elwood was published by four different publishers during his first six years as an SF anthologist. During the next few years he would contract with more than a dozen other publishers to produce many dozens of individual books and two anthology series, the four-book &quot;Continuum&quot; and two-book &quot;Frontiers&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction &quot;observes that &quot;At one time it was estimated that Roger Elwood alone constituted about one quarter of the total market for SF short stories.&quot;

About the time the SF anthology market was decreasing, Elwood began working for Laser Books, an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by romance publishing giant Harlequin Books to systematize and regularize SF into a uniform series of novels by diverse authors. He then effectively quit ordinary science fiction/fantasy during the late 1970s, becoming a prolific writer of Christian-based novels during the 1990s, with more than thirty novels published during that decade.

Elwood&#x27;s biography on the Fantastic Fiction website omits mention of his work concerning ordinary science fiction/fantasy and identifies him as a Writer-in-Residence (or occasionally a &quot;professor of literature&quot;) at a Bible college in the mid-western USA. The biography also claims that &quot;12 of his novels have won Excellence in Media awards for best book of the year&quot;, although the Silver Angels award website includes only a general &quot;Print&quot; category, and does not list Elwood&#x27;s name.

==Criticisms==
Elwood&#x27;s work as a genre anthology editor during the mid 1970s is not without its detractors, whose criticisms range from professional to ad hominem; James Nicoll has noted that Elwood&#x27;s &quot;capacity to produce anthologies at high speed was not, alas, matched with an ability to produce interesting anthologies&quot;, as well as the possibility that &quot;readers, having read a few unremarkable Elwood anthologies, were reluctant to buy more&quot;.

A review of Elwood&#x27;s 1976 anthology &quot;Six Science Fiction Plays&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan magazine &quot;Enterprise Incidents&quot; remarked that except for the inclusion of the original teleplay of the episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; by Harlan Ellison, the book was &quot;another excursion into mediocrity by Roger Elwood.&quot;

Amongst other criticisms, which she suggests &quot;are more conjectural, but not easily dismissed&quot;, Nielsen Hayden nominates &quot;the quality of the books themselves&quot;. She describes Elwood&#x27;s theme anthologies as &quot;carelessly edited&quot; and &quot;low-grade&quot;, although she allows that &quot;some of Elwood&#x27;s collections were quite decent,&quot; and that &quot;all of them featured some good writers and good stories.&quot;

The following are examples of peer recognition accorded to some of the stories printed in Elwood&#x27;s anthologies (source: the Internet Speculative Fiction Database):

* The short story &quot;Forever and Amen&quot; by Robert Bloch, from Elwood&#x27;s 1972 anthology &quot;And Walk Now Gently Through The Fire and Other Science Fiction Stories&quot; was chosen by Forrest J. Ackerman for inclusion in his &quot;Best Science Fiction for 1973&quot; compilation.
* The 1973 anthology &quot;Future City&quot; included &quot;The World as Will and Wallpaper&quot; by R. A. Lafferty, which was reprinted by Terry Carr in &quot;The Best Science Fiction of the Year #3&quot; (1974), &quot;The Undercity&quot; by Dean Koontz, which has been re-anthologized twice (in 1977 by Martin H. Greenberg and Joseph D. Olander in &quot;Criminal Justice Through Science Fiction&quot;, and in 1997 by Ric Alexander in &quot;Cyber-Killers&quot;), and &quot;Getting Across&quot; by Robert Silverberg which has also been re-anthologized twice (in 1986 by Greenberg et al. in &quot;Computer Crimes and Capers&quot; and in 1997 by Waugh and Greenberg in &quot;Sci-Fi Private Eye&quot;). The &quot;Future City&quot; anthology itself was reprinted in the United Kingdom by Sphere Books in 1976.
* Robert Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;The Wind and the Rain&quot;, from Elwood&#x27;s 1973 anthology &quot;Saving Worlds&quot;, was reprinted by Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss in their &quot;Best SF: 1973&quot; anthology.
* &quot;After King Kong Fell&quot; by Philip José Farmer, from Elwood&#x27;s 1973 anthology &quot;Omega&quot;, was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1974, and reprinted by Harrison and Aldiss in &quot;Best SF: 1974&quot;.
* Elwood&#x27;s 1973 anthology &quot;Showcase&quot; contains Silverberg&#x27;s novelette &quot;Breckenridge and the Continuum&quot;, which was chosen by Terry Carr for &quot;The Best Science Fiction of the Year #3&quot; (1974), as well as &quot;The Childhood of the Human Hero&quot; by Carol Emshwiller, which was included in &quot;Nebula Award Stories 9&quot;, edited by Kate Wilhelm.
* Thomas F. Monteleone&#x27;s short story &quot;Breath&#x27;s a Ware That Will Not Keep&quot;, from Elwood&#x27;s 1975 anthology &quot;Dystopian Visions&quot;, was nominated for a Nebula award in 1976.
* No less than twenty of the stories chosen by Barry N. Malzberg for inclusion in his collection &quot;The Best of Barry N. Malzberg&quot; (1976) were first published in one or other of Elwood&#x27;s original anthologies.

===Professionalism===
Elwood is reported to have underpaid authors. Additionally, Teresa Nielsen Hayden discusses speculation about the financial details of some of Elwood&#x27;s projects &quot;that by all indications should have had generous budgets&quot; but were &quot;peculiarly long on authors who had slight or nonexistent publishing credentials outside of Roger Elwood projects.&quot;

Elwood&#x27;s eight-volume young adult hardcover &quot;Lerner SF Library&quot; (1974), with three or four stories per volume, includes stories from three authors whose only recorded sale, according to the Internet Speculative Fiction Database, was to that book; two more authors who only ever sold stories to Roger Elwood; and one whose only first sale was to Roger Elwood, but who had the story republished elsewhere.

SF hardcovers were relatively uncommon during the 1970s and the stories were supposedly original commissions, so Nielsen Hayden believes it is reasonable to assume that this was a well-funded project. Normally the entire advance for an anthology is paid to the anthologist, who then purchases story rights out of his or her own pocket, retaining any unspent advance money.

Given the availability of experienced short fiction writers at the time, Elwood&#x27;s choice of inexperienced authors aroused suspicions.

The &quot;Lerner SF Library&quot; also contains two stories by Earl and Otto Binder, and a third story by Otto alone.
Given that Earl and Otto Binder ceased to co-author stories in 1955, and that Earl died in 1965 and Otto in 1974, it seems unlikely any of these stories was a commissioned work.

===Effect on the industry===
Nielsen Hayden reports that, prior to Elwood&#x27;s involvement with the market, anthologies and collections were very popular with readers, and were considered by the publishing industry to be &quot;a surer bet than novels&quot;. She accuses Elwood of &quot;singlehandedly breaking the story collection/anthology market&quot;. By &quot;wreck[ing] the readers&#x27; faith in collections&quot; she says, Elwood &quot;squandered industry credibility accumulated over decades by better anthologists&quot;. Anthologies and story collections, she suggests, became &quot;a hard sell&quot;.

The idea that Elwood&#x27;s effect has been a long-term one, as Nielsen Hayden maintains, is difficult to maintain considering the continuing high numbers of anthologies published annually.

<doc id="400862" wikidata="Q5439433" url="?curid=400862" title="Fearful Symmetry (album)">
<text>Fearful Symmetry is the seventh studio album by Christian alternative rock band Daniel Amos, issued on Frontline Records in 1986. It is the fourth and final album in their &quot;¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot; album cycle and the first of three albums the band issued under the shortened moniker DA.

==Background==
&quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; is a lush, synthesizer driven pop album, lyrically wrapped in puzzles that the listener has to decipher. Nearly every song on &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; in some way deals with pain or darkness - from the William Blake-inspired &quot;Sleep Silent Child&quot;, a song about death, to &quot;Strong Points, Weak Points&quot;, a song about doubt. The album title comes from a line in &quot;The Tyger&quot; by William Blake. The album ends on an upbeat note however, with the touching ballad, &quot;Beautiful One&quot;.

&quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; was the final chapter of a four-part series of albums by DA entitled &quot;The ¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot;, which also included the albums &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;, and &quot;Vox Humana&quot;. The band raised eyebrows on the tour that followed each release, by presenting a full multimedia event complete with video screens synchronized to the music, something that was unusual in the early 1980s for any band. This album, along with the other three albums from the Alarma! Chronicles was re-released as part of the Alarma! Chronicles Book set in 2000. The Book Set included three CDs, over 200 pages of lyrics, photos, liner notes, essays, interviews and other information in a hardcover book.

As with &quot;Vox Humana&quot;, keyboardist Rob Watson was unavailable for the photo session for this album. Thus, the album&#x27;s group photo only shows four of the five band members.

<text>A referee is an official, in a variety of sports and competition, responsible for enforcing the rules of the sport, including sportsmanship decisions such as ejection. The official tasked with this job may be known by a variety of other titles depending on the sport, including umpire, judge, arbiter (chess), commissaire, or technical official (by the International Olympic Committee). Referees may be assisted by umpires, linesmen, timekeepers, touch judges, or video assistant referees.

== Football (association) ==

Originally team captains would consult each other in order to resolve any dispute on the pitch. Eventually this role was delegated to an &quot;umpire&quot;. Each team would bring their own partisan umpire allowing the team captains to concentrate on the game. Later, the referee, a third &quot;neutral&quot; official was added; this &quot;referee&quot; would be &quot;referred to&quot; if the umpires could not resolve a dispute. The referee did not take his place on the pitch until 1891, when the umpires became linesmen (now assistant referees). Today, in many amateur football matches, each side will still supply their own partisan assistant referees (still commonly called club linesmen) to assist the neutral referee appointed by the governing football association if one or both assistant referees are not provided. In this case, the role of the linesmen is limited to indicating out of play and cannot decide off side.

An association football (soccer) match is presided over by a referee, whom the Laws of the Game give &quot;full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed&quot; (Law 5). The referee is oftentimes assisted by two assistant referees, and sometimes by a fourth official.

== Football (American and Canadian) ==

An American football (or Canadian football) referee is responsible for the general supervision of the game and has the final authority on all rulings. The referee is assisted by up to six other officials on the field. These officials are commonly referred to as &quot;referees&quot; but each has a title based on position and responsibilities during the game: referee, head linesman (&quot;down judge&quot; in the NFL), line judge, umpire, back judge, side judge, and field judge. In the modern XFL, an additional &quot;ball judge&quot;, who wears a red hat, is on the field, but does not have the power to call penalties.

== Football (Gaelic) ==

There are usually 7 officials in Gaelic football. A main referee follows the play around the field and has the final authority on decisions such as fouls, throws and card-issuing, un-disputable by players. The main play referee is assisted by two linesmen, who make decisions on who gains possession when the ball goes out of the field of play, and can also advise the referee on off-the-ball events such as a fight or an illegal tackle. As well as the referee and two linesmen, there are two umpires at each end of the field of play who stand on either side of the goal post and raise a white flag for a point, or a green flag for a goal respectively, also calling wides and square-balls. An umpire can also advise the referee on off-the-ball incidents, but does not hold as much authority as a linesman. In recent times, technology called &#x27;Hawk-eye&#x27; can be used if both the umpires and referee are unsure of whether a point has been scored or not, though this technology is not widely available.

== Football (Rugby) ==

In 1892, the International Rugby Board was created as a result of a disputed try that the captains could not agree on whether it had been scored. The rugby laws were changed to require one referee and two touch judges at each game to make the arbitration easier and more consistent.

== Bandy ==
A game of bandy is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may be assisted by one or two assistant referees.
== Basketball ==
In international basketball and in college basketball, the referee is the lead official in a game, and is assisted by either one or two umpires. In the National Basketball Association, the lead official is referred to by the term &quot;crew chief&quot; and the two other officials are the &quot;referee&quot; and &quot;umpire&quot;. All of the officials in a basketball game are generally accepted to have the same authority as the lead official and therefore they are collectively known as the &quot;officials&quot; or &quot;referees&quot;.

== Boxing ==

In boxing a referee is the person who enforces the rules during the fight. He gives instructions to the fighters, starts and stops the count when a competitor is down, and makes the determination to stop a fight when a competitor cannot continue without endangering his health.

== Cue sports ==
In cue sports, such as billiards and snooker, matches are presided over by a referee. The referee will determine all matters of fact relating to the rules, maintain fair playing conditions, call fouls, and take other action as required by these rules.

== Floorball ==
A floorball game is controlled by two referees with equal power.

== Handball ==
According to the International Handball Association, team handball games are officiated by two referees with equal authority who are in charge of each match. They are assisted by a timekeeper and a scorekeeper. In professional competitions, one or more delegates assist the referees by overseeing that rules are followed and the behaviour in the technical area. (Source: International Handball Association, Rules of the Game, 1 August 2005).

== Hurling ==

There are usually 7 officials in hurling. A main referee follows the play around the field and has the final authority on decisions such as fouls, throws and card-issuing, un-disputable by players. The main play referee is assisted by two linesmen, who make decisions on who gains possession when the ball goes out of the field of play, and can also advise the referee on off-the-ball events such as a fight or an illegal tackle. As well as the referee and two linesmen, there are two umpires at each end of the field of play who stand on either side of the goal post and raise a white flag for a point, or a green flag for a goal respectively, also calling wides. Any umpire can also advise the referee on off-the-ball incidents, but does not hold as much authority as a linesman. At inter-county senior games and other important matches, an eighth official, the &quot;Sideline Official&quot;, receive substitution notes and holds up the number of substituted players and the amount of additional time, similar to a soccer fourth official. In recent times, technology called Hawk-Eye can be used if both the umpires and referee are unsure of whether a point has been scored or not, although this technology is not widely available.

== Ice hockey ==

Ice hockey games are presided over by on-ice referees, who are generally assisted by on-ice linesmen. The combination of referees and linesmen varies from league to league. Some leagues use the title &quot;assistant referee&quot;, giving those officials greater powers to call certain penalties. In addition, off-ice officials administer to specific functions such as goal judge, penalty timekeeper, game timekeeper, statistician, official scorer and, at the highest professional levels, instant replay official.

== Korfball ==
In korfball, it is the referee&#x27;s responsibility to control the game and its environment, to enforce the rules and to take action against misbehaviour. He is assisted by an assistant referee, who alerts the referee to out balls and fouls and may have other tasks determined by the referee, and where possible by a timekeeper and scorer.

== Lacrosse ==
A lacrosse match is presided over by a crew of either two, three, or in some cases four on-field officials. In two-man crew, a Referee and an Umpire are utilized. In a three-man crew, a Referee, Umpire, and Field Judge are utilized. The Referee shall always have the final ruling on any and all matters. For games of significance a four-man crew can be used which includes a three-man crew plus a Chief Bench Official who has jurisdiction over the bench area including the timekeeper. The professional outdoor league in the United States utilizes four on-field officials in order to be able to better keep up with the increased pace of play.

== Mixed martial arts ==
Rules in mixed martial arts (MMA) bouts are enforced by a referee who can give warnings and disqualifications should the rules be broken. The referee is also in charge of stopping fights when a fighter &quot;cannot intelligently defend himself&quot; in order to prevent him from incurring further damage, as well as making sure that submissions are released following a tapout and to pull fighters off an unconscious opponent. The referee is advised by a doctor and assistant referee who sit ringside.

The primary concern and job of an MMA referee is the safety of the fighters.

== Roller derby ==
The game of roller derby is governed by a team of up to seven skating referees. (Only three are required due to the grass-roots nature of the sport, though the full seven are used whenever possible). The required referees are a head referee, who oversees the running of the entire game and has final say in any disputes, and who doubles as an inside pack referee, following alongside the main pack of skaters from inside the track and issuing and enforcing penalties for fouls or infringements of the rules; and two jammer referees who follow the two point-scoring players known as jammers. Additional referees fill the roles of a second inside pack ref and up to three outside pack refs, who perform similar duties to the inside pack refs, but from the outside of the track, and who rotate active duty in a relay-race style to avoid fatigue caused by the extra speed needed to keep pace with the pack from the outside. Non-skating officials complete the team by recording and communicating points and penalties and ensuring skaters serve their time accordingly. Only the team captains may engage in discussions with the referees by way of the head referee, over calls made. Referees are also responsible for ensuring the skaters are correctly wearing all regulation safety equipment.

== Underwater hockey ==
An Octopush or underwater hockey match is presided over by two or three water referees in the pool, a chief referee on deck, and at least one timekeeper and one scorekeeper. Additional timekeepers can be used to track penalty times in highly contested matches. A tournament referee will arbitrate for chief referees, whilst protests will be adjudicated by at least three independent referees.

== Volleyball ==
A volleyball match is presided over by a first referee, who observes action from a stand, providing a clear view of action above the net and looking down into the court. The second referee, is at floor level on the opposite side of the net—and in front of the scorers&#x27; table. They are often referred to informally as the &quot;up referee&quot; and &quot;down referee,&quot; respectively. While the first referee watches over actions involving the ball (and thus the attacking team), the second referee usually judges errors committed by the defending team, like touching the net. The first referee assumes a supervisory control over the match at all times while creating a cooperative environment with the second referee, line judges, and scorers. The second referee&#x27;s duties are multi-faceted and include on-court responsibilities during play, working with the scorers, interacting with coaches and bench personnel, and in some collegiate volleyball competitions, handling challenge reviews.

== Wrestling (amateur) ==
The international styles of amateur wrestling use a three-official system in which a referee conducts the action in the center of the mat while a judge and a mat chairman remain seated and evaluate the action from their stationery vantage points.

Collegiate wrestling uses a single referee in the center of the mat, or a head referee and an assistant.

== Wrestling (professional) ==
In professional wrestling, the referee&#x27;s on-stage purpose is similar to that of referees in combat sports such as boxing or mixed martial arts. However, in reality referees are participants in executing a match in accordance with its pre-determined outcome as well as any other events that are scripted to take place during the match. They also function as a conduit for communication between the wrestlers and backstage officials during matches.

==Fencing==
The first regularized fencing competition was held at the inaugural Grand Military Tournament and Assault at Arms in 1880, held at the Royal Agricultural Hall, in Islington in June. The Tournament featured a series of competitions between army officers and soldiers. Each bout was fought for five hits and the foils were pointed with black to aid the judges.

A fencing match is presided over by a referee. The referee must award a point to the fencer with right of way during the final action in the event of a double touch in foil and saber. A typical bout has one head referee and a video referee and at the request of a fencer can also have two visual referees.

==Figure skating==
A referee in figure skating sits in the middle of the judges panel and manages and has full control over the entire event. The referee represents the International Skating Union at international events. Referees for international events are trained by the International Skating Union. There are two levels of referee, International Referee and ISU Referee, with ISU Referees ranking higher.

In Synchronized Ice Skating, there are two Referees. One, sits with the Judges as with ordinary competition and operates a touch screen computer, inputting deductions and marking the skaters. The other, known as the Assistant Referee — Ice, stands by the barrier where the teams enter the ice. The ARI monitors ice conditions, communicates with the event Referee and supervises teams.

==Sumo==

A professional sumo match is overseen by a in the ring and five seated around the ring. All dress in traditional Japanese clothing, with higher-ranked referees wearing elaborate silk outfits inspired by clothes worn in ancient Japan and judges wearing traditional men&#x27;s kimono. The referee oversees the pre-match rituals and the bout itself, including ruling on the winner of the bout and the winning technique used. If one of the umpires disagrees, then all the judges confer to determine the winner of the bout. Tradition holds that if one of the two top ranked &quot;gyōji&quot; has his decision overturned, he is expected to tender his resignation, although the Chairman of the Japan Sumo Association usually rejects the resignation. Additionally, as professional sumo has several religious and traditional elements apart from the sport itself, &quot;gyōji&quot; have additional tasks in presiding over various ceremonies and functions.

In an amateur sumo competition, such as those sanctioned by the International Sumo Federation, the roles of referee and judges remain the same as professional sumo, though the religious and traditional elements and tasks for referees have been removed. Referees in amateur sumo wear an all white uniform with black bowtie akin to the appearance of western boxing referees.

==Other terms==

===Umpire===
An umpire is an official in several sports such as baseball and cricket. A few sports such as American and Canadian football (see above) have both a referee and an umpire.

===Commissaire (cycling)===
A commissaire is an official in competitive cycling.

===Marshal (motorsport)===
Aside the race control who are responsible for the start, running and timekeeping of the race, each section of the circuit is presided by a team of marshals led by an observer, who also report incidents and technical mishap of the race.

===Range officer (shooting)===

In practical shooting competitions within the IPSC, Range Officers enforce the rules. The International Range Officers Association is the part of IPSC with the responsibility to train and certify range officials in order to ensure that matches are run safely, fair and according to the rules. The Range Officer (RO) is the lowest ranking referee, and the one issuing range commands and following the competitor during the Course of Fire. The Chief Range Officer (CRO) oversees the Range Officer, and has primary authority over the particular course. The overall authority for all officials in the entire match is held by the Range Master (RM).

If an athlete disagree with a call made by a Range Officer, he may consult the Chief Range Officer to challenge the call. If the call is still upheld, the matter may be brought to the Range Master. Finally, if the call is upheld by the Range Master, the athlete may lodge a formal protest to the Arbitration Committee. However, some referee calls may not be challenged by the athlete, particularly those regarding safe firearms handling.

===Gamemaster (role-playing games)===
A gamemaster acts as an organizer, officiant for regarding rules, arbitrator, and moderator for a multiplayer role-playing game. They are more common in co-operative games in which players work together than in competitive games in which players oppose each other.

===Judge (Hebrew language)===
The Biblical Book of Judges revolves around a succession of leaders (judges). The same word is also used in modern Hebrew for referees in any kind of contest and in particular in sport. To distinguish them from judicial judges and from each other, the kind of the contest is added after the word &quot;shofet&quot; in the Construct state (e.g. &quot;shofet kaduregel&quot; שופט כדורגל, literally &quot;judge of soccer&quot;).

<doc id="400893" wikidata="Q94800" url="?curid=400893" title="Qalandia">
<text>Qalandia or Qalandiya (), also known as Kalandia (), is a Palestinian village located in the West Bank, between Jerusalem and Ramallah, just west from the Jerusalem municipality boundary. The village had a population of 572 residents in 2017. Qalandia is also the name of a refugee camp, established by UNRWA in 1949. It is located just east from Jerusalem municipality. Qalandia refugee camp was built for Palestinian refugees from Lydda, Ramle and Jerusalem of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight.

==History==
A large Jewish farmhouse from the late Second Temple period has been discovered in Qalandiya. Occupied from the Hellenistic period until its destruction during the First Jewish–Roman War, the site includes two large structures and rock-cut industrial facilities, including wine and oil presses. The presence of two miq&#x27;vaot and typical stone vessels indicates the site&#x27;s Jewish identity. Excavations yielded two complete amphoras, several amphora fragments, hundreds of coins, potsherds, chalk vessels, metal objects, jewelry, and various tools. Nearby exploration revealed burial caves, winepresses, cisterns, and quarries.

Ancient tombs have been found at Qalandia. A Byzantine bath has been excavated, and pottery from the same period has also been located there.

During the Crusader period, it was noted that Qalandia was one of 21 villages given by King Godfrey as a fief to the canons of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1151 the Abbot leased the use of the vineyards and orchards of Qalandia to a Nemes the Syrian and his brother Anthony and their children. In return the convent was given a part of the yearly production from these fields. In 1152 Queen Melisende exchanged villagers whom she owned for shops and two moneychanger counters in Jerusalem. All the names of the Qalandia villagers were Christian, which indicate that Qalandia was a Christian village at the time.

===Ottoman era===
Qalandia, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the Ottoman census of 1596, the village, called Qalandiya, was a part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Al-Quds which was under the administration of the &quot;liwa&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of Al-Quds. The village had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, and paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on wheat, barley, olives, beehives and/or goats, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 3,900 akçe.

In 1838, it was noted as a Muslim village in the Jerusalem District.

In 1863, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he described as small hamlet consisting of a few houses with fig plantations around them, while an Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed 16 houses and a population of 50, though the population count included only the men.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described the village as a &quot;small village on a swell, surrounded by olives, with quarries to the west.&quot;

In 1896 the population of &quot;Kalandije&quot; was estimated to be about 150 persons.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Qalandieh (Qalandia)&quot; had a population of 144, of which 122 Muslims and 22 Jews. This had decreased in the 1931 census when &quot;Qalandiya&quot; had an all-Muslim population of 120, in 25 houses.

In the 1945 survey, Qalandia had a population of 190 Muslims, and a land area of 3,940 dunams. 427 dunams were designated for plantations and irrigable land, 2,202 for cereals, while six dunams were built-up.

====Qalandia airport====

An airstrip to the east of Qalandia was built by the British army in 1925. It was located a few kilometers
north of Jerusalem at a site that offered flat terrain in a largely hilly region. In 1936 it was renovated by the Jewish entrepreneur Pinchas Rutenberg and began to be used commercially on a limited basis by 
Rutenberg’s airline, Palestine Airways, and the British carrier, Imperial Airways.

Until 1927, it was the only airport in Mandatory Palestine, although there were several military airfields. Qalandia was used for prominent guests bound for Jerusalem. It opened for regular flights in 1936. 
After the Six-Day War, it was renamed Atarot Airport by Israel, but closed down due to disturbances related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and because international companies refused to land there. Israel confiscated 639 dunums from Qalandia village in order to establish a military base at the former airport.

===1947–1949===
During the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, in early January 1948, the residents of Qalandia evacuated the village and moved to Ramallah, leaving a few young men to protect the property and make sure mines were not planted on the way leading to the village and the nearby mine. The villagers returned to the village and after the news of the Deir Yassin massacre arrived the women, the children and most of the men were evacuated again and the village became a post of the Arab Liberation Army In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Qalandia came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.

===Qalandia refugee camp===

The Qalandia refugee camp was established in 1949 by the Red Cross on land leased from Jordan. It covers as of 2006 and has a population of 10,024 with 935 structures divided into 8 blocks. Israeli authorities consider it part of Greater Jerusalem, and it remains under their control.

===1967-present===
Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Qalandia has been under Israeli occupation.

After the 1995 accords, 2% of Qalandiya’s land was classified as Area B, while the remaining 98% is Area C. Israel has confiscated 574 dunams of land from Qalandiya in order to construct the Israeli industrial settlement Atarot and 639 dunams for the Israeli Qalandiya military base. 1,940 dunums of the village, 59.3% of the village’s total area is isolated behind the Israeli West Bank barrier. In 2006, 1,154 people were living in the village according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

The Qalandia checkpoint is the main checkpoint between the northern West Bank and Jerusalem, and is known for frequent demonstrations against the occupation.

The Israeli 2013 Qalandia raid led to clashes with local residents, leaving three of Qalandia&#x27;s inhabitants dead and several critically wounded.

<text>Reuben C. Fine (October 11, 1914 – March 26, 1993) was an American chess player, psychologist, university professor, and author of many books on both chess and psychology. He was one of the strongest chess players in the world from the mid-1930s until his retirement from chess in 1951. He was granted the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1950, when titles were introduced.

Fine&#x27;s best result was his equal first place in the 1938 AVRO tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of all time. After the death of world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, Fine was one of six players invited to compete for the World Championship in 1948. He declined the invitation, however, and virtually retired from serious competition around that time, although he did play a few events until 1951.

Fine won five medals (four gold) in three Chess Olympiads. He won the US Open all seven times he entered (1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1939, 1940, 1941). He was the author of several chess books, covering endgame, opening, and middlegame.

== Early life and family ==
Fine was born in the Bronx, New York City to Russian Jewish parents Jacob and Bertha (Nedner) Fine. He had a sister, Evelyn (born in 1912), and was raised by his mother alone from the age of two. An uncle taught him chess when he was eight.

==Chess career==

===Teenage master===
Fine began chess as a young teenager at the famous Manhattan Chess Club, where he hustled for nickels, until he was asked to stop; he used the money to help feed his family. Afterwards he moved to the rival Marshall Chess Club in New York City, stomping grounds for many famous players, such as Bobby Fischer, later on. At this stage of his career, Fine played a great deal of blitz chess, and he eventually became one of the best blitz players in the world. By the early 1930s, he could nearly hold his own in blitz chess against the then world champion Alexander Alekhine, although Fine admitted that the few times he played blitz with Alekhine&#x27;s predecessor José Raúl Capablanca, the latter beat him &quot;mercilessly&quot;.

Fine&#x27;s first significant master-level event was the 1930 New York Young Masters tournament, which was won by Arthur Dake. He narrowly lost a 1931 stakes match to fellow young New York master Arnold Denker.

Fine placed second at the 1931 New York State Championship with a score of 8/11, half a point behind Fred Reinfeld. Fine won the 15th Marshall Chess Club Championship of 1931 with 10½/13, half a point ahead of Reinfeld. He defeated Herman Steiner by 5½–4½ at New York 1932; this was the first of three matches between them.

===U.S. Open Champion===

At 17, Fine won his first of seven US Opens at Minneapolis 1932 with 9½/11, half a point ahead of Samuel Reshevsky; this tournament was known as the Western Open at the time. Fine played in his first top-class international tournament at Pasadena 1932, where he shared 7th–10th with 5/11; the winner was world champion Alexander Alekhine. Fine repeated as champion in the 16th Marshall Club Championship, held from October to December 1932, with 11½/13, 2½ points ahead of the runner-up.

===College===
Fine graduated from City College of New York in 1932, at the age of 18; he was a successful student there. He captained CCNY to the 1931 National Collegiate team title; a teammate was master Sidney Bernstein. This tournament later evolved into the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship. Fine then decided to try the life of a chess professional for a few years.

=== Olympiad results ===
Fine won the U.S. team selection tournament, New York 1933, with 8/10. This earned him the first of three national team berths for the chess Olympiads. Fine won five medals (including three team golds) representing the United States; his detailed record follows; his totals are (+20−6=19), for 65.6%.
* Folkestone 1933: board three, 9/13 (+6−1=6), team gold, board silver
* Warsaw 1935: board one, 9/17 (+5−4=8), team gold
* Stockholm 1937: board two, 11½/15 (+9−1=5), team gold, board gold

===North American successes===
Fine repeated as champion at the U.S./Western Open, Detroit 1933, with 12/13, half a point ahead of Reshevsky. Fine won the 17th Marshall Club Championship, 1933–34, with 9½/11. He defeated Al Horowitz in a match at New York 1934 by 6–3. Fine shared 1st–2nd at the U.S./Western Open, Chicago 1934, on 7½/9, with Reshevsky. He then shared 1st–3rd at Mexico City 1934, on 11/12, with Herman Steiner and Arthur Dake. At Syracuse 1934, Fine shared 3rd–4th, on 10/14, as Reshevsky won. Fine won his fourth straight U.S./Western Open at Milwaukee 1935, scoring 6½/9 in the preliminary round, and then 8/10 in the finals.

===European debut===
Having had outstanding successes in North America, Fine tried his first European individual international tournament at Łódź 1935, where he shared 2nd–3rd with 6/9 behind Savielly Tartakower. Fine won Hastings 1935–36 with 7½/9, a point ahead of Salo Flohr.

===Narrow misses at U.S. Championship===
Although Fine was active and very successful in U.S. open tournaments, he was never able to win the U.S. Championship, usually placing behind his great American rival, Samuel Reshevsky. The U.S. Championship was organized in a round-robin format during that era. When in 1936 Frank Marshall voluntarily gave up the American Championship title he had held since 1909, the result was the first modern U.S. Championship tournament. Fine scored 10½/15 in the U.S. Championship, New York City 1936, and tied third–fourth, as Reshevsky won. In the U.S. Championship, New York 1938, Fine placed second with 12½/16, with Reshevsky repeating as champion. In the U.S. Championship, New York 1940, Fine again scored 12½/16 for second place, as Reshevsky won for the third straight time. Then in the 1944 U.S. Championship at New York, Fine scored 14½/17 for second, losing his game to Arnold Denker, and finishing half a point back, as the latter won his only national title.

Fine tallied 50/64 in his four U.S. title attempts, for 78.1%, but was never champion. Not being national champion seriously hurt Fine&#x27;s prospects for making a career from chess.

===International success===
However, Fine&#x27;s international tournament record in the 1930s was superior to Reshevsky&#x27;s. The former did play many more top-class international events than the latter during that period, and was usually near the top of the table. By the end of 1937, Fine had won a string of strong European international tournaments, and was one of the most successful players in the world. Fine won at Oslo 1936 with 6½/7, half a point ahead of Flohr. Fine captured Zandvoort 1936 with 8½/11, ahead of World Champion Max Euwe, Savielly Tartakower, and Paul Keres. Fine shared 3rd–5th at the elite Nottingham 1936 event with 9½/14, half a point behind winners José Raúl Capablanca and Mikhail Botvinnik. Fine shared 1st–2nd at Amsterdam 1936 on 5/7 with Euwe, half a point ahead of Alekhine. Fine placed 2nd at Hastings 1936–37 with 7½/9, as Alekhine won.

The year 1937 was Fine&#x27;s most successful. He won at Leningrad 1937 with 4/5, ahead of Grigory Levenfish, who shared first in that year&#x27;s Soviet Championship. Fine won at Moscow 1937 with 5/7. Those two victories make Fine one of a very select group of foreigners to have won on Russian soil. Fine shared 1st–2nd at Margate 1937 with Keres on 7½/9, 1½ points ahead of Alekhine. Fine shared 1st–3rd at Ostend 1937 with Keres and Henry Grob on 6/9. At Stockholm 1937, Fine won with 8/9, 1½ points ahead of Gideon Ståhlberg. Fine then defeated Stahlberg by 5–3 in a match held at Gothenburg 1937. Fine placed 2nd at the elite Semmering/Baden 1937 tournament with 8/14, behind Keres. At Kemeri, Latvia 1937, Fine had a rare relatively weak result, with just 9/17 for 8th place, as the title was shared by Reshevsky, Flohr, and Vladimirs Petrovs. Fine shared 4th–5th at Hastings 1937–38 with 6/9 as Reshevsky won.

===AVRO 1938===

In 1938, Fine tied for first place with Paul Keres in the prestigious AVRO tournament in the Netherlands, scoring 8½/14, with Keres placed first on tiebreak. This was one of the most famous tournaments of the 20th century. It was organized with the hope that the winner of AVRO, a double round-robin tournament, would be the next challenger to world champion Alexander Alekhine. Since Alekhine won the title in 1927, he had been avoiding a rematch with his predecessor, Capablanca, whom many considered the strongest possible challenger. Fine finished ahead of future champion Mikhail Botvinnik, current champion Alekhine, former world champions Max Euwe and Capablanca, and Samuel Reshevsky and Salo Flohr. Fine won both of his games against Alekhine. Fine got out to a tremendous start, scoring five wins and a draw in his first six games, but then lost in round seven to Keres, and this wound up as the decisive game for the tournament victor, providing his tiebreak.

===Wartime years===
As World War II interrupted any prospects for a world championship match, Fine turned to chess writing. In 1939, Fine became the first world-class player to edit the classic opening guide &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot;. His work on the sixth edition of the book led to a significant increase in sales. In 1941 he wrote &quot;Basic Chess Endings&quot;, a compendium of endgame analysis which, some 80 years later, is still considered one of the best works on this subject. His book was the most comprehensive on the subject written to that time, included significant original work by Fine, and received worldwide acclaim. His &quot;The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings&quot;, though now out of date, is still useful for grasping the underlying ideas of many standard chess openings; it was revised in 1989.

Fine played a few serious American events during World War II, with international chess at a virtual standstill, and continued his successes with dominant scores. He won the U.S. Open at New York 1939 with 10½/11, half a point ahead of Reshevsky. In the 23rd Marshall Club Championship of 1939, Fine won with 14/16. He won the 1940 U.S. Open at Dallas with a perfect 8/8 in the finals, three points ahead of Herman Steiner. Fine won the New York State Championship, Hamilton 1941, with 8/10, a point ahead of Reshevsky, Arnold Denker and Isaac Kashdan. Fine won the 1941 Marshall Club Championship with 14/15, ahead of Frank Marshall. Fine won the 1941 U.S. Open at St. Louis, with 4/5 in the preliminaries, and 8/9 in the finals. Fine won the 1942 Washington, D.C. Chess Divan title with 7/7. He defeated Herman Steiner in match play for the second time by 3½–½ at Washington 1944. Fine won the U.S. Speed Championships of both 1944 (10/11) and 1945 (10/11). In the Pan-American Championship, Hollywood 1945, Fine placed 2nd with 9/12, behind Reshevsky. He played in the 1945 US vs USSR Radio team match, scoring ½/2 on board three against Isaac Boleslavsky. Then Fine traveled to Europe one last time to compete, in the 1946 Moscow team match against the USSR, scoring ½/2 on board three against Paul Keres.

===Declines to enter 1948 World Championship ===
As the World War ended in early September 1945, Fine was 30 years of age, and working on his doctorate in psychology. After World Champion Alekhine died in March 1946, FIDE (the World Chess Federation) organized a World Chess Championship tournament to determine the new champion. Alekhine was the first champion to die as title-holder, creating an unprecedented problem. As co-winner in the AVRO tournament, Fine was invited to participate, but he declined, for reasons that are the subject of speculation even today. Fine had played a third match against Herman Steiner at Los Angeles 1947, winning 5–1; this match was training for his potential world championship appearance.

Publicly, Fine stated that he could not interrupt work on his doctoral dissertation in psychology. Negotiations over the tournament had been protracted, and for a long time it was unclear whether this World Championship event would in fact take place. Fine wrote that he didn&#x27;t want to spend many months preparing and then see the tournament cancelled. However, it has also been suggested that Fine declined to play because he suspected there would be collaboration among the three Soviet participants to ensure that one of them won the championship. In the August 2004 issue of &quot;Chess Life&quot;, for example, Larry Evans gave his recollection that &quot;Fine told me he didn&#x27;t want to waste three months of his life watching Russians throw games to each other.&quot; Fine&#x27;s 1951 written statement on the matter in his book &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Chess Games&quot; was: Unfortunately for the Western masters the Soviet political organization was stronger than that of the West. The U.S. Chess Federation was a meaningless paper organization, generally antagonistic to the needs of its masters. The Dutch Chess Federation did not choose to act. The FIDE was impotent. The result was a rescheduling of the tournament for the following year, with the vital difference that now half was to be played in Holland, half in the U.S.S.R. Dissatisfied with this arrangement and the general tenor of the event, I withdrew.

Edward Winter quoted Fine as saying financial, professional and scheduling problems all influenced his decision.

===Final competitive appearances===
Once Fine completed his doctorate, he did play some more competitive chess. He won at New York 1948 with 8/9, ahead of Miguel Najdorf, Max Euwe, and Hermann Pilnik. Fine drew a match against Najdorf at 4–4 at New York 1949. He participated for the U.S. in the 1950 radio match against Yugoslavia, drawing his only game. Fine received the title of International Grandmaster in 1950 from FIDE, on its first official list of titled players. Fine&#x27;s final top-class event was the Maurice Wertheim Memorial, New York 1951, where he scored 7/11 for 4th, as Reshevsky won.

Given his pre-war results, Fine was invited to participate 1950 Candidates Tournament at Budapest, but declined his invitation; this tournament was the first to select an official challenger to the World Champion under the auspices of FIDE, the World Chess Federation.

===Lifetime scores against top players===
Fine had a relatively short career in top-level chess, but scored well against top players. He faced five World Champions: Emanuel Lasker (+1−0=0); José Raúl Capablanca (+0−0=5, excluding simultaneous games); Alexander Alekhine (+3−2=4); Max Euwe (+2−2=3); and Mikhail Botvinnik (+1−0=2).

His main American rivals were Samuel Reshevsky (+3−4=12); Herman Steiner (+21−4=8); Isaac Kashdan (+6−1=6); Albert Simonson (+6−1=1); Al Horowitz (+10−2=7); Arnold Denker (+7−6=7); Fred Reinfeld (+10−5=7); and Arthur Dake (+7−7=5, with three losses as a 16-year-old against Dake in his 20s).

Internationally, Fine faced the best of his time, and usually more than held his own, with three exceptions. He struggled against Paul Keres (+1−3=8); Milan Vidmar (+0−1=2); and Isaac Boleslavsky (+0−1=1), but he handled everyone else: Miguel Najdorf (+3−3=5); Savielly Tartakower (+2−1=4); Salo Flohr (+2−0=7); Grigory Levenfish (+1−0=0); George Alan Thomas (+2−0=3); Erich Eliskases (+1−0=2); Viacheslav Ragozin (+1−0=1); Vladimirs Petrovs (+2−1=1); Efim Bogolyubov (+1−0=1); Jan Foltys (+2−0=0); Salo Landau (+4−0=1); George Koltanowski (+2−0=1); Igor Bondarevsky (+1−0=0); Géza Maróczy (+1−0=0); William Winter (+4−0=0); Ernst Grünfeld (+1−0=0); Gideon Ståhlberg (+4−2=5); Andor Lilienthal (+1−0=0); László Szabó (+0−0=1); Vladas Mikėnas (+1−0=1); Rudolph Spielmann (+0−0=1); and Conel Hugh O&#x27;Donel Alexander (+1−0=3).

Finally, against the new generation of American masters which emerged in the late 1940s, Fine proved he could still perform well: Arthur Bisguier (+1−0=1); Larry Evans (+0−0=2); George Kramer (+1−0=1); and Robert Byrne (+0−0=1).

===Top ten for eight years===
Although FIDE, the World Chess Federation, did not formally introduce chess ratings for international play until 1970, it is nevertheless possible to retrospectively rate players&#x27; performances from before that time. The site Chessmetrics.com, which specializes in historical ratings throughout chess history, ranks Fine in the world&#x27;s top ten players for more than eight years, from March 1936 until October 1942, and then again from January 1949 until December 1950. Fine was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1986, the charter class. He continued his successful chess writing career for many years after he retired from competition.

===Notable games===
*Reuben Fine vs. Mikhail Botvinnik, Amsterdam AVRO 1938, French Defence, Winawer/Advance Variation (C17), 1–0 In the final position, &quot;Black does not have a single move, and Rf3 is threatened. A combination of a splendid strategic idea with tactical subtleties.&quot; (Botvinnik)
*Reuben Fine vs. Salomon Flohr, Amsterdam AVRO 1938, French Defence, Winawer/Advance Variation (C17), 1–0 Deep tactics in an unusual variant of French Defense.
*Reuben Fine vs. Herman Steiner, Pan-American Championship, Hollywood 1945. Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted, Classical (D29), 1–0 Fine sees further than his opponent in a sharp tactical position.

==Professional life==
Fine earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the City College of New York in 1932.

During World War II, Fine worked for the U.S. Navy, analyzing the probability of German U-boats surfacing at certain points in the Atlantic Ocean. Fine also worked as a translator.

After World War II, he earned his doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California. After receiving his doctorate he abandoned professional chess to concentrate on a new profession as a professor. Fine continued playing chess casually throughout his life (including several friendly games played in 1963 against Bobby Fischer, one of which is included in Fischer&#x27;s &quot;My 60 Memorable Games&quot;). In 1956 he wrote an article, &quot;Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters&quot;, for a psychological journal. Later, Fine turned the article into a book, &quot;The Psychology of the Chess Player&quot;, in which he provided insights steeped in Freudian theory. Fine is not the first person to have examined the mind as it relates to chess: Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test, had studied the mental functionality of good chess players, and found that they often had enhanced mental traits, such as a good memory. He went on to publish &quot;A History of Psychoanalysis&quot; (1979) and a number of other books on psychology.

Journalist Gilbert Cant observed: A great chess player, Manhattan&#x27;s Reuben Fine, has popularized a psychology of chess studded with phallic symbols, spattered with anal-sadistic impulses and imbued with latent homosexuality. In successive rounds, Fine once defeated Botvinnik, Reshevsky, Euwe, Flohr and Alekhine, and drew with Capablanca. When Fine switched his major interest from chess to psychoanalysis, the result was a loss for chess—and a draw, at best, for psychoanalysis. Many psychologists, some Freudians included, now believe that the sexual symbolism in chess is vastly overdrawn.

Fine served as a visiting professor at CCNY, the University of Amsterdam, the Lowell Institute of Technology, and the University of Florence. Fine founded the Creative Living Center in New York City.

==Personal life==
Fine married five times, all but the last ending in divorce. He had two biological children and one stepson.

Per the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he married Charlotte Margoshes in 1937. The New York County registrar lists a marriage certificate for Charlotte Margoshes on October 8, 1936, but the marriage was very short. &quot;The New York Times&quot; first mentions a marriage to Emma Thea Keesing (1916–1960), whom he met in the Netherlands, married in September 1937, and divorced in 1944. 

Fine remarried in 1946, to Sonya Lebeaux. They had two children together, a son, Benjamin, and a daughter. He wrote &quot;The Teenage Chess Book&quot; with Benjamin.

His last marriage, to Marcia Fine, lasted to his death in 1993.

<text>Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet are a Juno Award-winning Canadian instrumental rock band, formed in 1984. They remain best known for the track &quot;Having an Average Weekend&quot;, of which an alternate version was used as the theme to the Canadian sketch comedy TV show &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;. Although commonly classified as a surf rock band they rejected the label, going so far as to release a track called &quot;We&#x27;re Not a Fucking Surf Band&quot;, although they also later released a compilation box set titled &quot;Oh, I Guess We Were a Fucking Surf Band After All&quot;.

==History==
The band&#x27;s origins are in Calgary, where founding members Reid Diamond and Brian Connelly were members of the punk rock band Buick McKane in the 1970s. After that band broke up, Diamond, Connelly and drummer Alex Koch moved to Toronto, where they joined with Don Pyle to form a new punk band, Crash Kills Five. That band released one EP, &quot;What Do You Do At Night?&quot;, in 1980 before breaking up in 1981, and the members briefly pursued other projects before Diamond, Connelly and Pyle reunited in 1984 as Shadowy Men.

Signed to Cargo Records, they released a string of EPs and singles throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The group also appeared on many compilation albums, and played on some tracks of Fred Schneider&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Just Fred&quot;. The band won a Juno Award for Instrumental Artist of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1992.

Their 1993 album &quot;Sport Fishin&#x27;: The Lure of the Bait, The Luck of the Hook&quot; was engineered by Steve Albini, who was such a fan of the band that he offered to work with them for free.

The group disbanded in 1996, in part because Pyle and Diamond wanted to record an album with Jad Fair while Connelly did not. Pyle and Diamond instead joined with Dallas Good of The Sadies to form Phono-Comb, and collaborated with Fair on the 1996 album &quot;Monsters, Lullabies...and the Occasional Flying Saucer&quot;. Beverly Breckenridge from Fifth Column also later joined the Phono-Comb lineup.

After the breakup, Connelly was in a short-lived trio called Heatseekers, and toured and recorded with Neko Case and Her Boyfriends. He currently leads his own instrumental trio, Atomic 7. Diamond later started Danny &amp; Reid&#x27;s Motion Machine, and Pyle teamed up with Andrew Zealley to form Greek Buck.

Diamond died of cancer on February 17, 2001.

In March 2012, it was announced that the band would be reuniting for a pair of live performances, in Calgary on June 20 and Toronto on July 14, to mark the beginning of a series of reissues of all of their albums on Mammoth Cave Recording Co. Dallas Good replaced Diamond on bass. The reissues included the Crash Kills Five EP. Following Mammoth Cave&#x27;s closure in 2015, the albums were again reissued on Yep Roc Records in 2016 as the box set &quot;Oh, I Guess We Were a Fucking Surf Band After All&quot;. The band have continued to perform occasional shows since the 2012 reunion, including the 2017 Gateway Festival and the 2018 Northern Lights Festival Boréal.

Dallas Good died of natural causes on February 17, 2022.

<doc id="400902" wikidata="Q7340761" url="?curid=400902" title="List of High Kings of Ireland">
<text>Medieval Irish historical tradition held that Ireland had a High King (&quot;Ard Rí&quot;) based at Tara since ancient times, and compilations like the 11th-century &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, followed by Early Modern works like the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; and &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;, purported to trace the line of High Kings. John T. Koch explains: &quot;Although the kingship of Tara was a special kingship whose occupants had aspirations towards supremacy among the kings of Ireland, in political terms it is unlikely that any king had sufficient authority to dominate the whole island before the 9th century&quot;. Máel Sechnaill I is often considered the first historical High King, although he faced some opposition. Applying the title to earlier kings is considered anachronistic, while kings from before the 5th century are generally considered legendary. The traditional list of High Kings is thus a mixture of historical facts and legend.

The annals describe some later High Kings as &quot;rígh Érenn co fressabra&quot; (&quot;Kings of Ireland with opposition&quot;), which is a reference to the instability of the kingship of Tara from the death of Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill in 1022. He had been overthrown by Brian Boru in 1002, and restored in 1014 following Brian&#x27;s death, but Brian&#x27;s example was followed by many other dynasties in the century following 1022. The High Kingship was effectively ended in the 1170s after the Anglo-Norman invasion, its last holder being Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair.

==Legendary kings==

===Kings in the &quot;Baile Chuind&quot;===
The earliest-surviving list appears in the &quot;Baile Chuind&quot; (The Ecstasy of Conn), a late-7th-century poem in which Conn of the Hundred Battles experiences a vision of the kings who will succeed him. Many of these kings appear to correspond with the kings of later traditions, although the order is different, and some of the kings cannot be identified. The last four kings following Snechta Fína (Fínsnechta Fledach) do not correspond with any of the kings in later lists. The poem is therefore presumed to have been written during his time, and the kings who follow him are presumed to be fictional.

With few exceptions, kings belong to &quot;Dál Cuinn&quot; (the Connachta and Uí Néill). Understood as a list of kings of Tara, it is not considered to be inclusive. A number of well-known kings from the Laigin, Érainn, Ulaid and Cruthin, are missing. The chief rivals of Dál Cuinn after Conn&#x27;s floruit (and others for a few centuries before) were the Dáirine (usually the Corcu Loígde during Dál Cuinn&#x27;s era), two or three of whom are listed, but whose overkingdom in the south of Ireland collapsed in the 6th century. They were outmanoeuvred and replaced by the related Eóganachta, who established the Kingship of Cashel, soon to periodically rival Tara. The poem itself in its closing language probably mentions Cathal mac Finguine when young, and this can also be used to date the &quot;Baile Chuind&quot; to the late 7th or early 8th century.

===Synthetic lists===
The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, dating to the 11th–12th century, purports to list every High King from remote antiquity to the time of Henry II&#x27;s Lordship of Ireland in 1171. The High Kingship is established by the Fir Bolg, and their nine kings are succeeded by a sequence of nine kings of the Tuatha Dé Danann, most if not all of whom are considered euhemerised deities. After the Milesian (Gaelic) conquest the High Kingship is contested for centuries between the descendants of Eber Finn and Érimón, sons of Míl Espáine. The original compilation stopped at the reign of Tuathal Techtmar. The kings of the Goidelic dynasties established by Tuathal were added by other editors. Later editions of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; tried to synchronise its chronology with dateable kings of: Assyria, Persia and Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman emperors.

There are a handful of sources slightly predating the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; covering significant portions of essentially the same list of Milesian High Kings (though following a discrepant chronology), starting with the &quot;Laud Synchronisms&quot; estimated to have been compiled (part of Laud 610). The oldest section of the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; &quot;Roll of Kings&quot; is taken from the poems of Gilla Cómáin mac Gilla Samthainde, written .

Early Modern works like the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; and Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; continued this tradition based on later Irish annals. Keating&#x27;s chronology, based on reign lengths, is longer than the synchronised chronology of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, and the &quot;Four Masters&quot;″ chronology is even longer.

* &quot;LGE:&quot; synchronised dates from &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;
* &quot;FFE:&quot; chronology based on reign lengths given in Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Forus Feasa ar Erinn&quot;.
* &quot;AFM:&quot; chronology from the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;

====Fir Bolg High Kings====
These kings are considered to be legendary.
====Tuatha Dé Danann High Kings====
These kings are considered to be legendary.
====Milesian High Kings====
These kings are considered to be legendary.
====Goidelic High Kings====
Many of these kings are considered to be legendary. Dynastic affiliations are based on the genealogies of historical dynasties who claimed them as an ancestor.

==Semi-historical High Kings of Ireland==
These kings are historical figures for the most part, but naming them High Kings of Ireland may be anachronistic or inaccurate in certain cases. Their dynastic affiliations are also uncertain, as some may have been posthumously added to groups they did not belong to.

==Historical High Kings of Ireland==
These kings can be considered genuinely historical High Kings (with or without opposition).

==Later attempts at revival==
*Brian Ua Néill (d. 1260), as part of the mid-13th-century revolts against Anglo-Norman colonisation of Ireland
*Edubard a Briuis (d. 1318), as part of the Bruce campaign in Ireland

<doc id="400906" wikidata="Q257926" url="?curid=400906" title="Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia">
<text>Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia (; born 7 April 1936) is a member of the royal House of Karađorđević, a human rights activist and a former presidential candidate for Serbia. Yugoslavia abolished its monarchy in 1945 and decades later broke up into several countries.

==Early life==
Princess Elizabeth was born in the White Palace, Belgrade as the third child and the only daughter of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia (prince regent of Yugoslavia 1934–1941) and Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark. Her older brothers were Prince Nicholas and Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia, who married, firstly, Princess Maria Pia of Savoy and, secondly, Princess Barbara of Liechtenstein. She is a paternal second cousin of Queen Sofía of Spain and King Charles III, and a maternal first cousin of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and his siblings, Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. She is also a maternal third cousin of king Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Karađorđe, who started the first Serbian uprising against the Turks in 1804.

Her godmother and namesake was her maternal aunt Princess Elizabeth of Greece and Denmark.

Elizabeth was educated in Kenya, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Paris, where she studied the history of fine art. She speaks English, French, Spanish, Italian and Serbian.

Together with her brother Alexander, she took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. On this trip, Alexander met his first wife Maria Pia of Savoy, a daughter of Umberto II of Italy and Marie-José of Belgium.

==Marriages and children==
On 21 January 1961, Princess Elizabeth married firstly Howard Oxenberg (1919–2010), an American Jewish dress manufacturer and close friend of the Kennedy family. They were divorced in 1966. They have two daughters (and three granddaughters):

*Catherine Oxenberg (b. 22 September 1961) briefly married Robert Evans in July 1998 and had the marriage annulled nine days later. She married Casper Van Dien on 8 May 1999. They had two daughters and divorced in 2015. She also has a daughter, born in 1991, from a previous relationship.
**India Riven Oxenberg (b. 7 June 1991)
**Maya Van Dien (b. 20 Sep 2001) 
**Celeste Alma Van Dien (b. 3 Oct 2003)
*Christina Oxenberg (b. 27 December 1962) married Damian Elwes in May 1986. They later divorced.

Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s second marriage was to Neil Balfour of Dawyck (born 1944) on 23 September 1969. He was the grandson of Alexander Balfour. They divorced in November 1978. They have one son (and four granddaughters):

*Nicholas Augustus Roxburgh Balfour (b. 6 June 1970) married Jonkvrouw Stéphanie de Brouwer (b. 1971) in 2000. They have four daughters:
**India Lily Balfour (b. 17 October 2002)
**Gloria Elizabeth Balfour (b. 11 November 2005)
**Olympia Rose Balfour (b. 27 June 2007)
**Georgia Veronika Stefania Balfour (b. 10 September 2010)

In 1974, she was briefly engaged to the actor Richard Burton, after his first divorce from Elizabeth Taylor.

Princess Elizabeth married a third time, to former Prime Minister of Peru Manuel Ulloa Elías (1922–1992) on 28 February 1987. They separated in 1989, although the marriage was never officially dissolved. In 1992 Ulloa Elías died, which made the princess officially a widow.

==Career==
A businesswoman and writer, Elizabeth is the author of four storybooks for children and has created two perfumes- &quot;Jelisaveta&quot; and &quot;E&quot;. 

Elizabeth recognized early the dangerous signs that would turn the former Yugoslavia upside down in a bloodbath of historic religious and ethnic rivalries long suppressed by Communist rule. She spoke out in Europe and America on behalf of bridging the gap between ethnic hatreds. Working behind the scenes through United Nations programs, she also journeyed to the Vatican in 1989 to ask Monsignor Tauran, then Holy See Secretary for Relations with States, to help improve relations between Catholic and Orthodox communities in Yugoslavia.

In December 1990, she created the Princess Elizabeth Foundation, a non-political, not-for-profit organization after foreseeing the crucial importance of a vehicle to address the tension brewing just below the surface. Since the subsequent civil wars, her efforts have focused heavily on transporting medical supplies, food, clothing and blankets to refugee camps, in addition to finding homes for children victimized by war and placing older students in schools and colleges in America.

Before the breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1991, she invited the Orthodox Bishop Sava and the Mufti of Belgrade, along with the Yugoslav Minister for Religious Affairs to attend a conference in Moscow that was hosted by Mikhail Gorbachev. This was the second international gathering of political and religious leaders committed to world reform that included Mother Teresa, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dalai Lama, Al Gore and Carl Sagan:

In 2002, Princess Elizabeth received the first Nuclear Disarmament Forum Award, the &quot;Demiurgus Peace International&quot; (accompanying president Vladimir Putin, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Ted Turner and others), for outstanding achievements in the field of strengthening peace among nations in Zug, Switzerland.

She decided to run for President of Serbia in the 2004 Serbian presidential election, despite her cousin Alexander&#x27;s having objected that the Royal Family should stay out of politics. After the end of World War II, the Royal Family was banished from the country, and their goods confiscated. &quot;In case of victory,&quot; she stated, &quot;my priority would not be to return to a monarchy, but to form a real State.&quot; She got 63,991 votes or 2.1%, finishing in 6th place out of fifteen candidates.

==Royal property==
After the death of King Alexander I, and during the Regency administration (of Regent Prince Paul, Radenko Stanković, and Ivo Perović) that followed, the City of Belgrade District Court issued Decree N° 0.428/34 on 27 October 1938. The decree, which became official law on 4 March 1939, pronounced King Alexander I&#x27;s underage sons Crown Prince Peter, Prince Tomislav, and Prince Andrew, in equal parts, heirs to his entire estate. This included all real estate at Dedinje: the Royal Palace (Old Palace) in Belgrade, its surrounding land and forest, and the White Palace, with its appertaining houses. On 2 August 1947, Edvard Kardelj, then vice-president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, issued a decree that confiscated all these properties from the Karadjordjević family. This followed an earlier decree in March 1947, which stripped members of the family of their citizenship.

The decree by the National Assembly of the Presidency of the People&#x27;s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was abolished in 2001, after the deposing of Slobodan Milošević. The new government of Yugoslavia restored to all members of the royal family both their citizenship and the use of the royal complex in Dedinje. In 2013, it was announced that the villa &quot;Crnogorka&quot; (meaning Montenegrin), in Uzička Street, Dedinje, was to be returned to Princess Elizabeth. The villa had been bought in 1940 by her mother Princess Olga and taken by the state in 1947. By 2013 it was owned by the Serbian government and used as the official residence of the Ambassador of Montenegro.

Elizabeth settled permanently in Belgrade, living at the Villa &quot;Montenegrina&quot;, until she sold it in 2018.

==Arms==

Princess Elizabeth was granted heraldic arms on 20 June 2008. Her motto translates into English as &quot;Service Is Love In Action&quot;.

== Honours ==
* Grand Patron of the Order of the Fleur of Lys (United Kingdom).
* Dame Grand Cordon of the Royal and Hashemite Order of the Pearl (Sultanate of Sulu).

==See also==
*Politics of Serbia
*2004 Serbian presidential elections

<text>John Douglas Anthony (31 December 192920 December 2020) was an Australian politician. He served as leader of the National Party of Australia from 1971 to 1984 and was the second and longest-serving deputy prime minister, holding the position under John Gorton (1971), William McMahon (1971–1972) and Malcolm Fraser (1975–1983).

Anthony was born in Murwillumbah, New South Wales, the son of federal government minister Hubert Lawrence Anthony. He was elected to the House of Representatives at a 1957 by-election, aged 27, following his father&#x27;s sudden death. He was appointed to the ministry in 1964 and in Coalition governments over the following 20 years held the portfolios of Minister for the Interior (1964–1967), Primary Industry (1967–1971), Trade and Industry (1971–1972), Overseas Trade (1975–1977), National Resources (1975–1977), and Trade and Resources (1977–1983). Anthony was elected deputy leader of the Country Party in 1964 and succeeded John McEwen as party leader and deputy prime minister in 1971. He retired from politics at the 1984 election. His son Larry Anthony became the third generation of his family to enter federal parliament.

==Early life==

Anthony was born in Murwillumbah in northern New South Wales, on 31 December 1929, the son of Jessie Anthony () and Hubert Lawrence (&quot;Larry&quot;) Anthony, a well-known Country Party politician. Doug Anthony was educated at Murwillumbah Primary School and Murwillumbah High School, before attending The King&#x27;s School in Sydney (1943–1946) and then Gatton College in Queensland. After graduating he took up dairy farming near Murwillumbah. In 1957 he married Margot Budd, with whom he had three children: Dougald, Jane and Larry.

==Political career==

===Early career (1957–1964)===

In 1957 Larry Anthony Sr., who was Postmaster-General in the Liberal–Country Party coalition government led by Robert Menzies, died suddenly, and Doug Anthony was elected to succeed his father in the ensuing by-election for the Division of Richmond, aged 27. He was appointed Minister for the Interior in 1964 by Menzies in a reshuffle, replacing Senator John Gorton.

===Minister for the Interior (1964–1967)===

During his tenure in the Interior portfolio, there were several pushes for Canberra to become independent and self-governing in some capacity. The Menzies government had not yet established a clear policy for Canberra&#x27;s future, and Anthony stated that the city was not yet ready for self-governance. At Narrogin in August 1966, Anthony relayed to several rural communities that drought would probably soon sweep the region, and that he was prepared to take precautions to prevent as many negative effects as possible. He was unable to comment on protests that took place outside the Canberra Hotel on 2 February 1967.

Anthony was one of the leading forces against the 1967 nexus referendum, which was seeking to increase the Senate&#x27;s power in parliament. Senator Vince Gair revived the debate around the introduction of such a law in early 1967. Anthony and the County Party decided it would be “unwise” to increase the power of the upper house.

Towards the end of his term as Minister for the Interior, Anthony supported a federal redistribution with conditions so restrictive that it favoured country seats and would increase Country Party representation. Splits within the Liberal and Country coalition were causing such issues to be raised and considered by parliament. These tensions were also fuelled by the narrow majority with which the Liberal Party was returned to power in the 1963 election; without Country Party support they could not have guaranteed parliamentary supply. In 1967, he became Minister for Primary Industry.

===Minister for Primary Industry (1967–1971)===

His first speech in this portfolio was made regarding the wheat price in Australia. 1966–67 had yielded a smaller amount than the 1965–66 season, and accordingly the price of wheat had to be raised. Controversially, in May 1968, Anthony initiated a payout of $21 million to offset the devaluation of the British Pound by Prime Minister Harold Wilson; the currencies were not yet independent of each other. Anthony&#x27;s popularity in the Industry portfolio was damaged when rural production was down $450 million in 1968 and little change had occurred in the return that farmers were getting for production. Anthony worked with Prime Minister John Gorton to try to create as many economically viable options as possible to deal with the “wheat crisis”. Eventually quotas were introduced to limit production. When China stopped importing Australian wheat in 1971, Anthony advised against communication with the country, saying it could be “politically and commercially dangerous&quot;.

===Deputy Prime Minister (1971–1972)===

By mid-1969, it was thought that John McEwen, leader of the Country Party since 1958, was going to retire sometime in late 1970. The three members of the party considered to have the greatest chance of succeeding McEwen as leader were Anthony, Shipping Minister Ian Sinclair and Interior Minister Peter Nixon. When McEwen retired in 1971, Anthony was chosen as his successor, taking McEwen&#x27;s old posts of Minister for Trade and Industry and Deputy Prime Minister in the government of John Gorton, portfolios he retained under William McMahon. Anthony was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom by Queen Elizabeth II on 23 June 1971.

When McMahon became Prime Minister in March 1971, only a month after Anthony had taken the Deputy Prime Minister position, Anthony lost power as McMahon disliked him and the two had a poor working relationship. Anthony opposed the revaluation of the Australian dollar by McMahon in 1971–72. In mid-1972, McMahon stopped talking to Anthony and he was oblivious to many decisions that were occurring outside cabinet. When McMahon announced the 1972 election, he left Anthony in the dark and he was unaware of the date on which it would take place and the campaign techniques the coalition would use. Anthony called the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jack Marshall, to find out the date, as McMahon had only informed three people of the date before approaching the Governor-General of Australia. Anthony lost faith in the government and became complacent about the defeat which became obvious in the lead up to the election in December 1972.

===Opposition (1972–1975)===

After McMahon&#x27;s defeat in 1972, Anthony was said to favour a policy of absolute opposition to the Labor government of Gough Whitlam. Despite that, the Country Party voted with the Labor government on some bills, for example the 1973 expansion of state aid to under-privileged schools. Under Anthony&#x27;s leadership, the party&#x27;s name was changed to the National Country Party and it began contesting urban seats in Queensland and Western Australia. There was also a weakening in the party&#x27;s relationship with primary producer organisations. In 1975, Anthony, along with other senior Opposition members, criticised Whitlam for not giving enough aid to Papua New Guinea.

===Deputy Prime Minister (1975–1983)===

Anthony had a much better working relationship with Malcolm Fraser than he did with Billy Snedden. At first, Anthony did not support Snedden&#x27;s or Fraser&#x27;s decisions to block parliamentary supply from the Labor Party, beginning in October 1975, though he was soon convinced otherwise. The Coalition was confirmed in power at the 1975 election, with the biggest majority government in Australian history. Though from 1975 to 1980 the Liberals won enough seats to form government in their own right, Fraser opted to retain the Coalition with the NCP. Anthony again became Deputy Prime Minister, with the portfolios of Overseas Trade and National Resources (Trade and Resources from 1977). Anthony was noted, while Prime Minister Fraser took annual Christmas holidays, for governing the country as Acting Prime Minister from a caravan in his electorate of Richmond.

In 1976, during his second term as Deputy Prime Minister, Anthony began a strong import and export relationship with Japan, particularly over oil. Anthony supported the mining and export of Australian uranium, and believed it would be an essential part of the future economy. While Acting Prime Minister in July 1976, he was the first user of the Papua New Guinea–Cairns telephone line, speaking to Acting Prime Minister Sir Maori Kiki. While Acting Prime Minister in July 1979, he threatened to shut down an industrial strike in Western Australia, stating the issue had to be resolved. The Labor Party was strongly opposed to this action and called his power as Acting Prime Minister into question. After Fraser lost office in 1983, Anthony remained as party leader (since 1974 named the National Party). The last major move as leader of the National Party that Anthony made was to explain the tensions between the Liberal and National parties in Queensland, who officially opposed each other in the October 1983 election.

==Retirement and death==

Anthony remained in parliament for less than a year before retiring from politics in 1984. By then, although only 55, he was the Father of the House of Representatives. He returned to his farm near Murwillumbah and generally stayed out of politics. In 1996, Larry Anthony won his father&#x27;s old seat.

In 1994, Anthony appeared in a documentary series about the Liberal Party in which he revealed that McMahon had refused to tell him beforehand the date of the 1972 election, despite Anthony being the Country Party leader. During 1999, Anthony spoke in support of Australia becoming a republic.

Anthony died at an aged care home in Murwillumbah, on 20 December 2020, at the age of 90. Until his death, he was the earliest-elected Country Party MP still alive, and along with his deputy and successor as National Party leader, Ian Sinclair, he was one of the last two surviving ministers who served in the Menzies Government and the First Holt Ministry.

==Honours==

In 1981, Anthony was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). In 1990, he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 2003 he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for service to the Australian Parliament, for forging the development of bi-lateral trade agreements, and for continued leadership and dedication to the social, educational, health and development needs of rural and regional communities.

<doc id="400917" wikidata="Q6136040" url="?curid=400917" title="USS North Carolina (ACR-12)">
<text>USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; (ACR-12/CA-12) was a armored cruiser of the United States Navy. The ship was built by Newport News Shipbuilding; she was laid down in March 1905, launched in October 1906, and was commissioned in May 1908. The final class of armored cruisers to be built for the US Navy, &quot;North Carolina&quot; and her sisters were armed with a main battery of four guns, and were capable of a top speed of .

&quot;North Carolina&quot; spent much of her career in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea conducting training and visiting foreign countries. She went on short deployments to the Mediterranean Sea twice, the first in 1909 to protect American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, and the second during World War I, again to protect still neutral American citizens in the region. After the United States entered the war in April 1917, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was used to escort troop ships off the eastern coast of the United States. Following the war in late 1918 and early 1919, she was used to carry soldiers from the American Expeditionary Force back from France. In 1920, the ship was renamed Charlotte so her original name could be used for a new battleship, and she was decommissioned the following year. She was sold for scrap in September 1930 and broken up thereafter.

==Design==

&quot;North Carolina&quot; was long overall and had beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship was propelled by two 4-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by sixteen coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers trunked into four funnels. The engines were rated at , which produced a top speed of . She had a storage capacity for up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 914 officers and men. Originally fitted with a pair of military masts, &quot;North Carolina&quot; had her foremast replaced with a cage mast in 1911.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; was armed with a main battery of four 40-caliber Mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. These were supported by a secondary battery of sixteen 40-caliber Mark 8 guns mounted in casemates, eight on each broadside. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty-two 50-caliber guns in single pedestal mounts either in casemates or sponsons in the hull. She also carried a variety of smaller guns, including twelve 3-pounder automatic guns and four 1-pounders. Like other contemporary armored cruisers, she was also armed with four torpedo tubes located below the waterline in her hull. &quot;North Carolina&quot; was protected by a combination of Krupp cemented steel and older Harvey steel. The ship&#x27;s armored belt was thick and the maximum thickness of the armor deck was 3 in thick. The main battery turret faces were thick, as were the sides of the conning tower.

==Service history==

The keel for &quot;North Carolina&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, on 21 March 1905. She was launched on 6 October 1906, and after completing fitting-out, was commissioned into the fleet on 7 May 1908. She thereafter began a shakedown cruise along the eastern coast of the United States, down to the Caribbean Sea. After returning to the United States, she embarked President-elect William Howard Taft for a tour of the Panama Canal, then still under construction. The voyage lasted from January to February 1909. Starting on 23 April, &quot;North Carolina&quot; began a cruise in the Mediterranean Sea to protect United States citizens from domestic unrest in the Ottoman Empire. While in Adana on 17 May, the ship sent a landing party ashore to render medical aid to sick and wounded Armenians who had been attacked in an anti-Armenian massacre. &quot;North Carolina&quot; also sent food, water, and other supplies to help the situation, before continuing her patrol in the eastern Mediterranean. She returned to the United States on 3 August.

For the next eight years, &quot;North Carolina&quot; conducted training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean and visited other countries in the region to show the flag. She represented the United States at Argentina&#x27;s centennial celebration of its independence in May and June 1910, followed by Venezuela&#x27;s centennial in June and July 1911. She carried the United States Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, on a tour of the Caribbean, stopping in Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, Cuba, and the Panama Canal in July and August. At the conclusion of that trip, she returned to New York City with the remains of a sailor from the armored cruiser , which had been destroyed in 1898 in Havana, Cuba. In October, &quot;North Carolina&quot; underwent maintenance at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard—during her stay, a team of her crew played against the 1911 New Hampshire football team in nearby Durham, New Hampshire. The rest of her early career passed uneventfully.

On 7 August 1914, as World War I broke out in Europe, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was sent on a patrol in the Mediterranean to protect then still neutral United States citizens in the region. She visited Jaffa, Beirut, and Alexandria before returning to Boston on 18 June, where she underwent an overhaul. The ship thereafter went to Pensacola, Florida, where she arrived on 9 September, to conduct experiments with naval aviation. She became the first ship to launch an aircraft using a catapult while underway on 5 November; these tests led to the widespread use of aircraft catapults aboard battleships and cruisers through the 1940s.

Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was employed as an escort for troop ships traveling between Norfolk and New York. Starting in December 1918, after the war had ended, she assisted in the repatriation of American soldiers from the American Expeditionary Force; this effort lasted until July 1919. On 7 June 1920, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was renamed &quot;Charlotte&quot; so that her name could be used for a new &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleship then under construction. &quot;Charlotte&quot; remained in service only briefly under her new name before being decommissioned on 18 February 1921 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 July 1930 and was sold for scrap on 29 September.

<text>Mount Temple is a mountain in Banff National Park of the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada.

Mt. Temple is located in the Bow River Valley between Paradise Creek and Moraine Creek and is the highest peak in the Lake Louise area. The peak dominates the western landscape along the Trans-Canada Highway from Castle Junction to Lake Louise.

==History==
The mountain was named by George Mercer Dawson in 1884 after Sir Richard Temple who visited the Canadian Rockies that same year. Mt. Temple was the first peak to be climbed in the Canadian segment of the Rocky Mountains.

;Accidents
* On July 11, 1955, in one of Canada&#x27;s most tragic mountaineering accidents, seven American male teenagers were killed on the southwest ridge route. A warm summer day had caused several nearby avalanches. They finally decided to turn back and during the descent, an avalanche swept 10 members of the party down the snowfield through a bottleneck of rocks. The entire party only had one ice axe among them and were not well prepared for the seriousness of the route. The party had also gone up the route without either of their two group leaders.
* On Sept. 25, 2015, Jen Kunze, an avid runner and hiker from Calgary, Ab. fell to her death.
* On July 11, 2022, Matt Miller, a man from Edmonton fell to his death while hiking with a group of experienced hikers.
;Routes
The mountain offers several routes for climbers and the normal route on the southwest side offers a moderate class scrambling route. See &quot;Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies&quot; for a description of that route. 
* South-West Ridge (Normal Route) (I)
** By late July or early August, the southwest ridge is generally free of snow and is a moderate scramble for experienced parties.
* East Ridge (IV 5.7)
* North Face, Elzinga/Miller (IV 5.7)
* North Face, Geenwood/Locke (V, AI 2, 5.8, A2 or 5.10+ R or M6)
* North East Buttress, Greenwood/Jones (V, 5.7, A3 or 5.10) One of the most secure routes on the north side of the mountain. Free climbed in August 1983, René Boisselle and Bernard Faure.

Current route conditions can be obtained from a climbing warden at the park information centre in Lake Louise. A climber&#x27;s log outside the centre may also provide comments from other climbers.

;First Ascent
* August 17, 1894 Walter D. Wilcox, Samuel E. S. Allen and Lewis Frissell This was the first ascent of a peak above in the Canadian Rockies.

;First Winter Ascent
* January 2, 1969 James Jones and Dave Haley via the Southwest Ridge

<text>Willis Chatman Hawley (May 5, 1864 – July 24, 1941) was an American politician and educator in the state of Oregon. A native of the state, he would serve as president of Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, where he earned his undergraduate and law degrees before entering politics. A Republican, he served 13 terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Oregon from 1907 to 1933. He is best known as a lead sponsor of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act in 1930.

==Early life==
Hawley was born on a farm in the old Belknap settlement near Monroe in Benton County, Oregon, on May 5, 1864. After he attended country schools, he entered college. In 1884, he graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. Hawley was the principal of the Umpqua Academy from 1884–86. In 1888, he received a bachelor of arts degree from the school along with a Bachelor of Laws from the law department.

Next, he served as president of the Oregon State Normal School at Drain south of Eugene from 1888–1891. During this time he earned a master&#x27;s degree from Willamette in 1890 and the following year joined the faculty at his alma mater. Hawley became the president of Willamette, serving in that position from 1893 to 1902 while he was professor of history and economics for sixteen years at the school.

Then, he engaged in a variety of business and educational ventures before entering politics. Hawley became a member of the National Forest Reservation Commission and a member of the Special Committee on Rural Credits created by Congress in 1915. Additionally, he served as a member of the Commission for the Celebration of the Two Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of president and general George Washington.

==Politics==
Hawley won Oregon&#x27;s 1st Congressional District as a Republican in 1906. He was then re-elected every two years to Congress for the next 12 sessions of Congress. Hawley served in Washington, D.C., from March 4, 1907, until March 3, 1933. While in Congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means for the Seventieth and Seventy-first Congresses. Hawley was then a co-sponsor of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised import tariffs to record levels.

Hawley was defeated in his bid for renomination to his House seat in 1932, and left office in March 1933. He returned to Salem where he practiced law.

== Death and burial ==
He died on July 24, 1941, at the age of 77 in Salem and was interred at that city&#x27;s City View Cemetery.

<doc id="400929" wikidata="Q932332" url="?curid=400929" title="Foula">
<text>Foula (), located in the Shetland archipelago of Scotland, is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most remote permanently inhabited islands. The liner RMS &quot;Oceanic&quot; was wrecked on the Shaalds of Foula in 1914. Foula was the location for the film &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; (1937).

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Foula&quot; comes from the Old Norse &quot;Fugley&quot; &#x27;bird island&#x27;. On some early Modern maps (such as Willem Blaeu&#x27;s 1654 map of Orkney and Shetland), it is called Fule or Thule. The former – pronounced &quot;foo-lay&quot;– is just an alternate spelling of Foula. The latter is due to ancient sources – notably Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Agricola&quot; – often locating the mythical land of Thule in the Shetland Islands region, and the phonetic closeness of the island&#x27;s name. However, the Ancient Norse name post-dates the Thule narrative and is not connected to it.

==Geography==
Foula lies in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Walls on Mainland, Shetland. It was part of Walls civil parish and now is in the parish of Walls and Sandness. The island is about , with a low-lying coastal strip along the east side. With an area of , it is the eighth largest and most westerly of the Shetland Islands. It rises from low broken cliffs in the east to precipitous cliffs in the west. The island has five peaks, rising to at the Sneug and at the Kame. At the north end is Gaada Stack, a natural arch and towards the south-west is Da Sneck Ida Smaalie, a spectacular 30 m deep and 2 m wide crack in the cliffs. Foula lies on the same latitude as Saint Petersburg.

Foula has a population of 38 people, living in Hametun and Ham. Islanders previously made a living from fishing – first for whitefish, then lobster. Today, most islanders are crofters with income from sheep farming and birdwatching tourism. The island retains a post office in Ham.

A hidden reef, the &quot;Hoevdi Grund&quot; or the &quot;Shaalds o&#x27; Foula&quot;, lies just over east of Foula between the island and the Shetland Mainland. Tides here can reach , and as the reef comes to within less than a metre of the surface, it poses a significant threat to shipping.

===Transport===
BK Marine Limited operates the ferry service from Ham to Walls on Mainland, Shetland. &quot;New Advance&quot; carries up to 12 passengers and completes the voyage in about two hours. Flights take off from Foula Airfield to Tingwall Airport. A ferry service ran from Foula to Scalloway until 2010.

There is little shelter for boats in the island. The only beach is at the head of Ham Voe on the east coast. Local boats, including the mail boat, are hauled out of the water.

==Wildlife==

The island&#x27;s cliffs are home to numerous birds, including Arctic terns, red-throated divers and great skuas, and birders make up the bulk of visitors to the island. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports large colonies of cliff- and moorland-nesting seabirds.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Foula was first inhabited as far back as 5,000 years ago. Between 2006 and 2008, the Bath &amp; Camerton Archeological Society took several trips to Foula to study prehistoric standing stones. A particular sub-circular stone circle of interest was discovered in 2006 at Da Heights in the north of Foula. A further investigation launched in 2007 revealed that the sub-circular stone construction was man-made, elliptical in shape with its long axis pointing towards the mid-winter solstice, built before 1000 BC.

===15th to 19th centuries===
In 1490, the Ciske family&#x27;s estates were divided and Vaila and Foula became the property of Alv Knutsson. However, the Ciskes were Norwegian, and as Scotland had annexed Shetland a few decades before, there were confusing and conflicting claims of ownership.

In 1720, a smallpox epidemic struck the two hundred people living on Foula. Because the islanders were so isolated from the rest of the world, they had no immunity to smallpox, unlike most North European peoples at that time, and nine out of ten of the island&#x27;s population died in the epidemic.

Foula remained on the Julian calendar when the rest of the Kingdom of Great Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752. Foula adhered to the Julian calendar by keeping 1800 as a leap year, but it did not observe a leap year in 1900. As a result, Foula is now one day ahead of the Julian calendar and 12 days behind the Gregorian, observing Christmas Day on 6 January Gregorian and New Year on 13 January Gregorian.

The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Foula and Papa Stour for a while during the late 19th century. He opposed the prevailing truck system and drew political cartoons lampooning its deficiencies. In one, he drew Foula as a beautiful young woman being strangled by a boa-constrictor labelled &#x27;landlordism&#x27; watched by other reptiles called &#x27;missionary&#x27;, &#x27;laird&#x27; and &#x27;truck&#x27;.

The island was one of the last places where the Norn language was spoken (although it is claimed that Walter Sutherland of Skaw in Unst was the last speaker), and the local dialect is strongly influenced by Old Norse. In 1774 George Low, a young Scottish clergyman, visited Foula hoping to find remnants of oral literature in Norn, then nearing extinction. He found fragments of songs, ballads and romances, and from his best source, an old farmer called William Henry, the ballad now known as &quot;Hildina&quot;. Henry was quite poorly acquainted with the language, so that, although he had as a child memorised all 35 stanzas of the ballad in the original Norn, he could give Low only a summary of its content rather than a translation. &quot;Hildina&quot; is the only extant poem in Norn.

===20th century===

Professor Ian Holbourn purchased Foula around 1900, becoming its last laird. He described the disaster of 8 September 1914, when the armed merchant cruiser HMS &quot;Oceanic&quot;, formerly a White Star liner, wrecked on the Shaalds o&#x27; Foula. Holbourn embarked upon the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in May 1915 and survived its sinking.

The professor&#x27;s grandson, Robert Holbourn, a naval architect, acted as the island&#x27;s &quot;Peat Marshal&quot; for many years. Peat is a valuable and scarce resource for heat and fuel in Shetland. Its cutting requires skill, taking several years to master. The most able islanders become known as the &#x27;cutters&#x27; and, in the spirit of a long-standing Foula tradition, all able-bodied men are now and then &quot;bid to the banks&quot; of women who &quot;didn&#x27;t have a cutter in the house&quot;.

Simon Martin, who stayed in Foula for five years in the 1970s while salvaging metal from &quot;Oceanic&quot;, describes the island as follows:

A lighthouse at the southern tip of the island was built in 1986. Originally powered by acetylene gas, it has been converted to solar and wind power.

==Culture and the arts==

===Religion===
Many inhabitants of Foula attend the Presbyterian Kirk, also known as Baxter Chapel, that is part of the Church of Scotland. It is built of grey stone and is situated &quot;on the tail of 7 Hamnafield&quot;.

===Film===
* Michael Powell&#x27;s film &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; (1937) is a dramatisation based on the true story of the evacuation of the last 36 inhabitants of the remote island of St Kilda, on 29 August 1930. St Kilda lies in the Atlantic Ocean, west-northwest of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides; the inhabitants spoke Gaelic. Powell was unable to get permission to film in St Kilda. Undaunted, he made the film over four months during the summer of 1936 on Foula, where the islanders speak Shetland dialect.
* &quot;Return To The Edge Of The World&quot; (1978) is a documentary capturing a reunion of the 1937 film&#x27;s cast and crew, 40 years later, as they revisit the island.
* In 2023 Polish writer and director Klaudiusz Chrostowski made a low-budget film &quot;Ultima Thule&quot;, starring Jakub Gierszał as a 30-year-old man arriving on the island to get over the death of his father. The film was almost entirely shot on Foula and features Arthur Henri, a local inhabitant, in the main supporting role. The film won the Best Micro Budget Film Award at Gdynia Film Festival in 2023.

===Folklore, festivities and traditions===
Foula&#x27;s inhabitants preserve many Norse traditions of folklore and festivities. They still follow the Julian calendar for Christmas celebrations, with all the islanders gathering in one house on 6 January. New Year&#x27;s Day falls on 13 January.

===Poetry===
Vagaland&#x27;s poem &quot;Da Sang o da Papa men&quot; about the fishermen of Papa Stour includes an insistent chorus chant, &quot;Rowin Foula Doon&quot;. This refers to the fishermen&#x27;s practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible. This entailed the boat&#x27;s being some west of Papa Stour.

==Geodesy==
The Sneug in Foula was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Orkney and Shetland.

== Notable residents ==
* Martin Ferguson Smith (b. 1940), scholar and writer. Since retiring in 1995 he has lived in voluntary self-isolation on Foula.
* Ian Holbourn (1872 – 1935), was Laird of Foula, a professor and lecturer at the University of Oxford, and a writer.
* Sheila Gear, author of &quot;Foula, Island West of the Sun&quot; (published 1983 by Robert Hale Limited). She was born in Oxford and studied zoology at Aberdeen University. She married Jim Gear, a crofter, and wrote a book about crofter life in Shetland.
* John Sands (1826–1900) of Ormiston, was a Scottish freelance journalist and artist with an interest in archaeology and folk customs. He spent almost a year on St Kilda and lived on several other remote islands including Foula.

<text>The Union Pacific Big Boy is a type of simple articulated 4-8-8-4 steam locomotive manufactured by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) between 1941 and 1944 and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad in revenue service until 1962.

The 25 Big Boy locomotives were built to haul freight over the Wasatch Range between Ogden, Utah, and Green River, Wyoming. In the late 1940s, they were reassigned to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where they hauled freight over Sherman Hill to Laramie, Wyoming. They were the only locomotives to use a 4-8-8-4 wheel arrangement: four-wheel leading truck for stability entering curves, two sets of eight driving wheels and a four-wheel trailing truck to support the large firebox.

Today, eight Big Boys survive, with most on static display at museums across the United States. One of them, No. 4014, was re-acquired by Union Pacific, and between 2014 and 2019 was rebuilt to operating condition for the 150th anniversary of the first transcontinental railroad. It thus regained the title as the largest and most powerful operating steam locomotive in the world.

==History==
===Design===

In 1936, Union Pacific introduced the Challenger-type (4-6-6-4) locomotives on its main line over the Wasatch Range between Green River and Ogden. For most of the route, the maximum grade is 0.82% in either direction, but the climb eastward from Ogden, into the Wasatch Range, reached 1.14%. Hauling a freight train demanded double heading and helper operations, which slowed service. Union Pacific therefore decided to design a new locomotive that could handle the run by itself: faster and more powerful than the compound 2-8-8-0s that UP tried after World War I, able to pull long trains at a sustained speed of once past mountain grades.

A Union Pacific design team led by Otto Jabelmann, the head of the Research and Mechanical Standards section of the Union Pacific&#x27;s Mechanical Department, worked with ALCO (the American Locomotive Company) to re-examine their Challenger locomotives. The team found that the railroad&#x27;s goals could be achieved by enlarging the Challenger firebox to about (about ), increasing boiler pressure to , adding four driving wheels, and reducing the size of the driving wheels from . The new locomotive was carefully designed not to exceed an axle loading of , and achieved the maximum possible starting tractive effort with a factor of adhesion of 4.0. It was designed to travel smoothly and safely at .

To achieve these new engineering goals, the Challenger locomotive was &quot;comprehensively redesigned from first principles&quot;, wrote locomotive historian Tom Morrison. The overall design simplified some aspects of previous locomotive designs and added complexity elsewhere. Compounding, booster, and feed water heaters were eliminated, as were Baker valve gear and limited cut-off. But the &quot;proliferation of valves and gauges on the backhead showed that running a Big Boy was an altogether more complicated and demanding task for the crew than running previous existing locomotives&quot;, Morrison wrote.

The 4-8-8-4 class series, originally rumored to be called the &quot;Wasatch&quot;, after the Wasatch Mountains, acquired its nickname after an unknown ALCO worker scrawled &quot;Big Boy&quot; in chalk on the front of No. 4000&#x27;s smokebox door, then under construction as the first of its class.

The Big Boys were articulated, like the Mallet locomotive design, although lacking the compounding of the Mallet. They were built with a wide margin of reliability and safety, and normally operated well below in freight service. Peak drawbar horsepower was reached at about . The maximum drawbar pull measured during 1943 tests was while starting a train.

The Big Boy has the longest engine body of any reciprocating steam locomotive, longer than two 40-foot buses. They were also the heaviest reciprocating steam locomotives ever built; the combined weight of the engine and tender outweighed a Boeing 747. There was some speculation that the first series of Chesapeake and Ohio 2-6-6-6 H-8 “Allegheny” locomotives, built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1941, may have weighed as much as , exceeding the Big Boys, but subsequent re-weighs of early-production H-8s, under close scrutiny by the builder and the railroad, found them to be about half a ton less than .

A few experiments were carried out on the Big Boys during their years in revenue service. One experiment saw the conversion of No. 4005 to oil fuel in 1946. Unlike a similar effort with the Challengers, the conversion failed due to uneven heating in the Big Boy&#x27;s large, single-burner firebox. The locomotive was converted back to coal in 1948. (Decades later, No. 4014 would be successfully converted to oil during its restoration.) Another experiment saw No. 4007 being modified with a single stack in October 1948. The results were unsatisfactory, and the locomotive was reverted to double stack after testing. One final short-term experiment was the fitting of smoke deflectors on locomotive 4019, similar to those found on the railroad&#x27;s FEF Series, as well as some of their Challengers. These were later removed, as the Big Boys&#x27; nozzle and blower in the smoke box could blow smoke high enough to keep engineers’ lines of sight clear.

===Construction===
The American Locomotive Company manufactured 25 Big Boy locomotives for Union Pacific: 20 in 1941 and five in 1944. Along with the Challengers, the Big Boys arrived on the scene just as traffic was surging in preparation for American participation in World War II.
===Operation===
The Big Boy locomotives had large grates to burn the low-quality bituminous coal supplied by Union Pacific-owned mines in Wyoming. Coal was carried from the tender to the firebox by a Standard Stoker Company type MB automatic stoker that could supply slightly over per hour. Water to the boiler was furnished by a Nathan type 4000C Automatic Restarting injector rated for 12,500 gallons per hour on the right side and an Elesco T.P. 502 exhaust steam injector rated for 14,050 gallons per hour on the left side. 

Upon their arrival on Union Pacific property in 1941, the Big Boys were assigned to the Utah Division&#x27;s First Sub, between Ogden and Green River, which included the 1.14% grade for which they were designed. From February 1943 to November of the same year, three Big Boys were assigned to the Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Line and ran between Ogden and Milford, Utah. In 1944, with the arrival of additional Challengers and the second order of Big Boys, their operating territory was expanded east from Green River to Cheyenne over the Wyoming Division&#x27;s Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Subs. Beginning in 1948, with Challenger locomotives taking over the bulk of service between Ogden and Green River, the Big Boys saw only occasional service on the Utah Division, while their operating territory was expanded to include the line south from Cheyenne to Denver. Between 1950 and 1957, they were occasionally assigned to handle trains east of Cheyenne to North Platte over the Nebraska Division&#x27;s Third Sub. In the final years of steam on the UP, where the locomotives were only fired up to help with the fall rush traffic, the Big Boys saw service only between Cheyenne and Laramie.

In April 1943, UP borrowed a dynamometer car from AT&amp;SF to evaluate Big Boy performance. Several test runs were made on the Evanston Subdivision from Ogden to Evanston (76 miles), and it was found that a Big Boy could consume 11 tons of coal and 12,000 gallons of water an hour operating at full throttle, producing 6,290 drawbar horsepower at 41.4 mph. Designed to haul 3,600 tons up the 1.14% ruling gradient over this subdivision, the tests demonstrated that a Big Boy could handle 4,200 tons, running at an average speed of 18 to 20 mph between those two division points.

The locomotives were held in high regard by crews, who found them sure-footed and more “user friendly” than other motive power. They were capable machines, and their rated hauling tonnage was increased several times over the years (see section on tonnage ratings). 

Postwar increases in the price of coal and labor, along with the advent of efficient, cost-effective diesel-electric power, spelled the end of their operational lives. They were among the last steam locomotives withdrawn from service on the Union Pacific. The last revenue train hauled by a Big Boy ended its run early in the morning on July 21, 1959. Most were stored in operational condition until 1961; four remained in operational condition at Green River, Wyoming, until 1962. Their duties were assumed by diesel locomotives and gas turbine-electric locomotives.

In 2019, Union Pacific completed the restoration of No. 4014 and placed it in excursion service. The locomotive was sent on a tour in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the completion of the First transcontinental railroad.

====Tonnage ratings over principal operating territories (1946-1959)==== 
Most grades on Union Pacific&#x27;s Overland Route were no steeper than 0.82%. So for a majority of the route, Big Boys could handle trains of roughly 6,000 tons in either direction, limited only by the length of sidings and the locomotives&#x27; capacity to recharge the train&#x27;s air brake system. The two exceptions were the 1.14% eastbound gradient between Ogden and Evanston and the 1.55% westbound gradient between Cheyenne and Sherman Hill. In 1953, the latter grade was alleviated by the opening of Track 3 via Harriman, whose 0.82% grade theoretically allowed a Big Boy to haul a 6,000-ton train unassisted the entire from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Ogden.


=====Notes=====
* All tonnage ratings are in exclusion of the engine and tender.
* Tonnage rating from Cheyenne to Buford may be increased by 66.6% with the addition of a helper locomotive.
* Tonnage ratings may be reduced by 10% for fast freight.
* Big Boys saw limited use on the line between Cheyenne and North Platte (in part because they were too long for the turntable in N Platte).

== No. 4005 accident==
On April 27, 1953, No. 4005 was pulling a freight train through southern Wyoming when it jumped a switch track at , throwing the engine onto its left side and derailing its tender and the first 18 freight cars of its 62-car train. The engineer and fireman were killed on impact; the brakeman died of severe burns in a hospital a few days later. The tender destroyed the cab of the locomotive, and the loads from the 18 derailed cars were scattered. The locomotive was repaired by Union Pacific at its Cheyenne facility and returned to service until 1962.

==Preservation==
Most of the 25 Big Boys were scrapped, but seven remain on static display—two indoors and five outdoors, under the elements—and an eighth, Union Pacific 4014, was rebuilt to operating condition by Union Pacific&#x27;s steam program.

<text>USS &quot;Montana&quot; (ACR-13/CA-13), also referred to as &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 13&quot;, later renamed Missoula and reclassified CA-13, was a armored cruiser of the United States Navy. She was built by the Newport News Drydock &amp; Shipbuilding Co.; her keel was laid down in April 1905, she was launched in December 1906, and she was commissioned in July 1908. The final class of armored cruisers to be built for the US Navy, &quot;Montana&quot; and her sisters were armed with a main battery of four guns, and they were capable of a top speed of .

&quot;Montana&quot; spent her active duty career in the Atlantic Fleet. She made two cruises to the Mediterranean Sea to protect American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, the first in 1909 in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution and the second during the Balkan Wars in 1913. &quot;Montana&quot; was also involved in political unrest in Central American countries, sending landing parties ashore in Haiti and in Mexico during the Occupation of Veracruz, both in 1914.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Montana&quot; was tasked with convoy escort and training ship duties. With the end of the war in November 1918 came a new task, transporting American soldiers back from the battlefields of Europe. She made six round trips to France and carried back a total of 8,800 men. &quot;Montana&quot; was then transferred to the Puget Sound Naval Yard in Washington state, where she was decommissioned and renamed &quot;Missoula&quot;. She remained in the reserve fleet until 1930, when she was stricken under the terms of the London Naval Treaty. The ship was eventually sold for scrap in 1935 and broken up.

==Design==

&quot;Montana&quot; was long overall and had beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship was propelled by two 4-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by sixteen coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers trunked into four funnels. The engines were rated at , which produced a top speed of . She had a storage capacity for up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 914 officers and men. Originally fitted with a pair of military masts, &quot;Montana&quot; had her foremast replaced with a cage mast in 1911.

&quot;Montana&quot; was armed with a main battery of four 40-caliber Mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. These were supported by a secondary battery of sixteen 40-caliber Mark 8 guns mounted in casemates, eight on each broadside. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty-two 50-caliber guns in single pedestal mounts either in casemates or sponsons in the hull. She also carried a variety of smaller guns, including twelve 3-pounder automatic guns and four 1-pounders. Like other contemporary armored cruisers, she was also armed with four torpedo tubes located below the waterline in her hull. &quot;Montana&quot; was protected by a combination of Krupp cemented steel and older Harvey steel. The ship&#x27;s armored belt was thick and the maximum thickness of the armor deck was 3 in thick. The main battery turret faces were thick, as were the sides of the conning tower.

==Service history==

The keel for &quot;Montana&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Drydock &amp; Shipbuilding Co. in Newport News on 29 April 1905. Her completed hull was launched on 15 December 1906, and after fitting-out work was completed, the new cruiser was commissioned into the United States Navy on 21 July 1908. She was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and was transferred to Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Montana&quot; steamed out of Norfolk on 5 August for a cruise off the eastern coast of the United States that lasted until 25 January 1909. On 8 October 1908 she put on a searchlight display as part of a fireworks display at Philadelphia. During the display her searchlights blinded the operator of Philadelphia Police Department steamer that then had a slight collision with a barge that &quot;Visitor&quot; was going to, to help put out a fire on board caused by malfunctioning fireworks. After a stop in Charleston, South Carolina, she continued south through the Caribbean Sea, arriving at Colón, Panama on 29 January. There, she joined the Special Service Squadron. This duty was interrupted twice; the first came in February, when she returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she and the rest of the Atlantic Fleet greeted the Great White Fleet at the conclusion of its circumnavigation of the globe. The second came in April, owing to instability in the Ottoman Empire following the Young Turk Revolution that threatened American interests. &quot;Montana&quot; departed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 2 April, when she was sent to the Mediterranean to protect Americans in the region. She remained there until 23 July, when she left Gibraltar, arriving in Boston on 3 August. She thereafter returned to her normal operations patrolling the eastern coast of the United States.

&quot;Montana&quot; departed Hampton Roads on 8 April 1910, bound for South America for the Argentina Centennial. She steamed in company with her sister ship , eventually reaching Maldonado, Uruguay, where the two cruisers met their sister and the armored cruiser , which had steamed down independently. The four ships then continued on to Bahía Blanca, Argentina, for the centennial celebrations. The ship left Argentina on 30 June and arrived back in Hampton Roads on 22 July. After resuming her normal peacetime routine for the following three months, &quot;Montana&quot; was tasked with escorting President William Howard Taft aboard &quot;Tennessee&quot; for a trip to Panama. The two ships departed Charleston on 10 November for the visit, which lasted a week. On 26 July 1911, &quot;Montana&quot; was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and she began an overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard that lasted until 11 November 1912. During the overhaul, a cage mast was installed in place of her original fore military mast.
After returning to service in late 1912, &quot;Montana&quot; made another trip to the eastern Mediterranean, departing in December. &quot;Montana&quot; again joined &quot;Tennessee&quot; for the patrol, which was ordered in response to the Balkan Wars between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League, which again threatened American interests in the region. The ships operated under the command of Rear Admiral Austin M. Knight. During the trip, which lasted until June 1913, she made stops in Beirut, İskenderun, and Mersin. After returning to the United States, the ship resumed her peacetime routine of training cruises off the American east coast, as well as cruises to Mexico, Cuba, and Haiti, over the following year. During this period, on 23 January 1914, &quot;Montana&quot; was in Haiti when Michel Oreste abdicated from the presidency. &quot;Montana&quot; and the German protected cruiser landed marines in Port-au-Prince to prevent rioting in the capital. Later that year, for a few days between 28 April and early May, &quot;Montana&quot; took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz, where the ship&#x27;s commander, Louis McCoy Nulton, led a landing party in the city during the occupation. &quot;Montana&quot; also carried the remains on the seventeen sailors and marines who had been killed in the fighting back to New York City, arriving on 10 May. There, the Navy held a ceremony attended by President Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.

===World War I===

After the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Montana&quot; initially was tasked with transporting men and materiel in the York River area, along with conducting training exercises. On 17 July, she was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force; she spent the majority of 1917 and 1918 escorting convoys from Hampton Roads, New York City, and Halifax, Nova Scotia to France. These operations included a troopship convoy of four transports—, , , and —carrying part of the American Expeditionary Forces on 6 August 1917. In early 1918, she was briefly used as a training ship for naval cadets from the United States Naval Academy in the Chesapeake Bay. A troopship convoy followed in June 1918 in company with the cruisers and and the destroyers and , protecting the Italian steamers , , and , the French , and American transports &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;Susquehanna&quot;.

In September 1918, &quot;Montana&quot; took part in another troopship convoy to France with the battleship , the armored cruiser , and the destroyer . The convoy consisted of the transports , , , &quot;Rijndam&quot;, &quot;Wilhelmina&quot;, British steamer &quot;Ascanius&quot;. The following month she joined the battleship to escort twelve British merchant ships bound for Liverpool. Following the Allied victory in November 1918, &quot;Montana&quot; was sent to France to begin the process of transporting American soldiers back from Europe. These operations were interrupted in March 1919, when on 5 March &quot;Montana&quot; departed New York in company with the passenger ship , which was carrying Wilson back to France for the conclusion of the peace treaty negotiations. By July 1919, she had made six round trips between France and the United States, carrying a total of some 8,800 American soldiers.

After the conclusion of the repatriation effort, &quot;Montana&quot; was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed &quot;Missoula&quot; on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.

<text>The fourth USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (C-4) (later IX-24) was the sixth protected cruiser of the United States Navy. Although designed by the Navy Department, her hull was similar to the preceding British-designed , but &quot;Philadelphia&quot; had a uniform main armament of twelve 6-inch guns.

She was laid down 22 March 1888 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, launched 7 September 1889, sponsored by Miss Minnie Wanamaker, daughter of merchant and philanthropist John Wanamaker; and commissioned 28 July 1890, Capt. Albert S. Barker in command.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; was built to Navy Department plans, with twelve 6-inch (152 mm)/30 caliber guns. Two guns each were on the bow and stern, with the remainder in sponsons along the sides. Secondary armament was four 6-pounder () guns, four 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, two 1-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and two .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns. Some of the weapons listed as Hotchkiss revolving cannon may actually have been rapid-firing guns. Four 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes were included in the design but never mounted.

References vary as to the ship&#x27;s armor. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; probably had gun shields and a conning tower. The armored deck was up to thick.

The engineering plant included an unusual mix of boilers: four Scotch return-tube double-ended, one single-ended, and four locomotive boilers. These produced steam for two horizontal triple expansion engines totaling (designed) for a designed speed of . This speed was attained on trials but the trial horsepower was only . As with other contemporary Navy Department designs, sails were fitted but soon removed. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; carried 525 tons of coal for a designed range of at .

The ship&#x27;s 6-inch guns were converted to rapid-firing in 1898. All armament was removed when &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was converted into a receiving ship in 1904.

== Service history ==

=== Atlantic Squadron, 1890–1893 ===
While fitting out at the New York Navy Yard, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was designated on 18 August as flagship of Rear Admiral Bancroft Gherardi, commanding the North Atlantic Squadron. The squadron departed New York on 19 January 1891 to cruise the West Indies for the protection of American interests until May. It was during this time Fred J. Buenzle had served aboard the &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, as noted in &quot;Bluejacket; An Autobiography&quot;, a part of the &quot;Classics of Naval Literature&quot; series. Then to the northern waters as far as Halifax, Nova Scotia. Early the following year, the flagship called at Montevideo, Uruguay, 6–18 February, after which she resumed cruising in the West Indies.
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; continued operations with the Atlantic Squadron along the eastern seaboard of the United States and in the West Indies until 1 March 1893. She was then assigned to the Naval Review Fleet as flagship of Rear Admiral Bancroft Gherardi. Charged with conducting the International Rendezvous and Review, with a fleet of twelve American ships, he received the visiting foreign ships as they commenced arrival in Hampton Roads on 8 April. The fleet steamed to New York 24 April, where it joined additional foreign visitors to form a combined fleet of 35 men-of-war. President Grover Cleveland reviewed the Fleet 27 April, after which appropriately festive ceremonies took place, initiating a parade through the streets of New York. The Naval Review Fleet disbanded 31 May and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; departed New York 30 June 1893, bound for the Pacific Squadron via Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Callao, Peru.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; arrived San Francisco 22 August 1893. As the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station, she cruised with the squadron, engaging in drills and maneuvers, and visiting various ports on the west coast of the United States, Mexico, and South America, and in the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard 14 October 1897 and decommissioned there 18 December.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; recommissioned 9 July 1898 and became the flagship of Rear Admiral J. N. Miller, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Station. She steamed from San Francisco 2 July to participate in the ceremonies attending the assumption of sovereignty by the United States over the Hawaiian Islands. Flagship &quot;Philadelphia&quot; arrived Honolulu 3 August, and nine days hence her officers and those of the steam sloop , with a force under arms from the two warships, represented the US Navy at the ceremonies transferring the Hawaiian Islands to the United States.

In March 1899, with Commander-in-Chief Rear Admiral Albert Kautz embarked, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; steamed to the Samoan Islands for duty in connection with the settlement of civil difficulties by the Samoan Commissioners of the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. A landing party from &quot;Philadelphia&quot; went ashore in the vicinity of Vailele 1 April to act in concert with a British landing party. The combined force, ambushed by adherents of Chief Mataafa, sustained seven killed and seven wounded, including two American officers, Lieutenant Philip Lansdale and Ensign John R. Monaghan, and two sailors killed, including Seaman Norman Edsall, and five bluejackets wounded. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; remained in the Samoan Islands until 21 May 1899, when she steamed for the west coast via Honolulu.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; served as flagship of the Pacific Station until 6 February 1900, when Rear Admiral Kautz transferred his flag to . The cruiser continued Pacific operations until 1902, conducting training cruises, drills, target practice, and port visits.

Returning from a six-month cruise off the Panamanian coast, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; arrived San Francisco 17 July 1902. Needing extensive repairs, she was ordered to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for decommissioning. Arriving Bremerton, Washington 23 August, she decommissioned at Puget Sound 22 September 1902.

=== Receiving ship, 1904–1926 ===
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; was housed over and became a receiving ship at Puget Sound Navy Yard 12 May 1904. She continued this service until 4 November 1912, when she became a prison ship. Resuming service as a receiving ship 10 January 1916, she was redesignated with the hull number IX-24 (unclassified miscellaneous) on 17 July 1920. She was struck from the Navy List on 24 November 1926.

Cruiser &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was sold at public auction at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in 1927 to Louis Rotherberg.

<doc id="400955" wikidata="Q1290642" url="?curid=400955" title="Partholón">
<text>Partholón () is a character in medieval Irish Christian pseudohistory, said to have led one of the first groups to settle in Ireland. His name comes from the Biblical name &quot;Bartholomaeus&quot; (Bartholomew), and may be borrowed from a character in the Christian pseudohistories of Saints Jerome and Isidore of Seville.

== Description ==
In most versions of the tale, Partholón is the leader of the second group of people to settle in Ireland, the &quot;Muintir Partholóin&quot; (People of Partholón). They arrive on the uninhabited island about 300 years after Noah&#x27;s Flood and introduce farming, cooking, brewing and building. After some years, they all die of plague in one week.

=== &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; ===
The earliest surviving reference to Partholón is in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, a 9th-century British Latin compilation attributed to Nennius. It says that Ireland was settled three times by three different groups, with &#x27;Partholomus&#x27; arriving first from Iberia with a thousand followers who multiplied until they numbered four thousand, before dying of plague in a single week.

=== &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; ===
The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, an 11th-century Christian pseudohistory of Ireland, says that Ireland was settled six times, with Partholón and his followers being the second group. The number may have been chosen to match the &quot;Six Ages of the World&quot;. According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, Ireland was uninhabited following the deaths of Cessair and her companions in the Flood. It says that Partholón came from Greece and was the son of Sera, son of Sru, who was himself a descendant of Magog, son of Japheth, who was the son of Noah. Partholón and his people sail to Ireland via Sicily and Iberia, arriving 300 or 312 years after the flood and landing at Inber Scéne (Kenmare in County Kerry). With Partholón were his wife (Delgnat), their three sons (Slanga, Rudraige and Laiglinne), the sons&#x27; wives (Nerba, Cichba and Cerbnad), and a thousand followers.

Partholón and all of his people—five thousand men and four thousand women—died of the plague in a single week, on Senmag (the &quot;old plain&quot;), near modern Tallaght.

=== &quot;Foras Feasa ar Érinn&quot; ===
Seathrún Céitinn&#x27;s 17th-century compilation &quot;Foras Feasa ar Érinn&quot; says they arrived in 2061 BC. It claims that Partholón was the son of Sera, the king of Greece, and fled his homeland after murdering his father and mother. He lost his left eye in the attack on his parents. He and his followers set off from Greece, sailed via Sicily and arrived in Ireland from the west, having traveled for two and a half months.

According to Céitinn, at the time of Partholón&#x27;s arrival, Ireland consisted of one open plain, three lakes and nine rivers. Partholóin cleared four more plains, and seven more lakes burst from the ground. Named figures are credited with having introduced cattle husbandry, ploughing, cooking, dwellings, trade and dividing the island into four parts. Partholon divides Ireland into four parts for his four sons named Er, Orba, Fearon, and Feargna.

In Céitinn&#x27;s version of the story, at the Battle of Mag Itha, the first battle fought in Ireland, the Partholóin battled and defeated the Fomorians, who were led by Cichol Gricenchos.

A poem in the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, expanded by Céitinn, tells how Partholón and his wife, Delgnat, lived on a small island near the head of the estuary of the River Erne. Once, while Partholón was out touring his domain, Delgnat seduced a servant named Topa. Afterward, they drank from Partholón&#x27;s ale, which could only be accessed through a golden tube. Partholón discovered the affair when he drank his ale and recognized the taste of Delgnat&#x27;s and Topa&#x27;s mouths on the tube. In anger, he killed Delgnat&#x27;s dog and Topa. But Delgnat was unrepentant and insisted that Partholón was to blame, as leaving them alone together was like leaving honey before a woman, milk before a cat, edged tools before a craftsman, or meat before a child, and expecting them not to take advantage. This is recorded as the first case of adultery and the first jealousy in Ireland. The island in question was named Inis Saimera after Saimer, Delgnat&#x27;s dog.

=== &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; ===
The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; says they arrived in 2520 Anno Mundi (after the &quot;creation of the world&quot;). This work states that the plague came 300 years after their arrival, in May, and that one man survived: Tuan, son of Partholón&#x27;s brother Starn. Known as a legendary seer, Tuan was said to be a storehouse of knowledge of Irish history because he lived across the generations in different incarnations. Through a series of animal transformations, he survived through the centuries to be reborn as the son of a chieftain named Cairell in the time of Colm Cille (6th century AD). He remembered all he had seen, and thus preserved Partholón&#x27;s story.

<text>Ida Sophia Scudder (December 9, 1870 – May 24, 1960) was a third-generation American medical missionary in India. She sought to improve the plight of Indian women by fighting against bubonic plague, cholera and leprosy. In 1918, she started a teaching hospital, the Christian Medical College &amp; Hospital, in Vellore, India.

==Early life==

Ida was born to John Scudder and Sophia (née Weld), in a line of medical missionaries that started with her grandfather, John Scudder Sr. They were members of the Reformed Church in America. Growing up as a child in India, Ida witnessed famine, poverty and disease. She was invited by Dwight Moody to study at his Northfield Seminary in Massachusetts, where she earned a reputation for pranks. In 1890, she returned to India to help her father when her mother was ailing at the mission bungalow at Tindivanam in the Madras Province. During her stay, she witnessed three women die in childbirth in one night and resolved to go into medicine. 

Scudder graduated from Cornell Medical College, New York City, in 1899, a member of the first class that accepted women as medical students. She then headed back to India and started a tiny medical dispensary and clinic for women at Vellore, 75 miles from Madras. Her father died in 1900, soon after she arrived in India. In two years, she treated 5,000 patients.

==Christian Medical College, Vellore==

Scudder opened the Mary Taber Schell Hospital in 1902. She decided to open a girls-only medical school and received 151 applications the first year (1918) and had to turn many away subsequently.

In 1928, ground was broken for the &quot;Hillsite&quot; medical school campus on 200 acres (0.8 km2) at Bagayam, Vellore. In 1928, Mahatma Gandhi visited the medical school. Scudder traveled a number of times to the United States to raise funds for the college and hospital. In 1945, the college was opened to men as well as women. In 2003 the Vellore Christian Medical Center was the largest Christian hospital in the world, with 2000 beds, and its medical school is now one of the premier medical colleges in India. In 2023, the center was ranked the number three college by the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF).

The Center was later headed by Scudder&#x27;s niece, Ida Belle Scudder, and fellow medical missionary Paul Brand worked there for a time.

==Last years==
In 1952, Scudder received the Elizabeth Blackwell Citation from the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, as one of 1952&#x27;s five outstanding women doctors.

She died on May 23, 1960, at her bungalow.

In 1960, Rajendra Prasad, then President of India, hailed Scudder as a “great lady, whose dedication and planned working are exemplary”.

<text>The Wyoming Department of Corrections (WDOC) is a state agency of Wyoming that operates adult correctional facilities. It is headquartered in Suite 100 of the 1934 Wyott Drive building in Cheyenne.

==History==
Wyoming entered the Union in 1890. As a territory, inmates were held at the Wyoming Territorial Prison at Laramie. Work began for a state prison at Rawlins in 1888, but the facility did not open until 1901. The building had 104 cells and housed both male and female inmates. In 1909, female inmates were transported to Colorado to serve their sentences. In 1950 an additional wing was added that featured running water and solitary confinement cells. This jail was in use until 1980. when the present state penitentiary was built.

In 1912, a riot resulted in the escape of twenty-seven inmates and the death of one local man.

A gas chamber was added in 1936. Five men were killed there. The original cell block gained running water in 1978.

In November 1990 Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment that abolished the Wyoming State Board of Charities and Reform. The institutions of the former state agency were divided and given to other agencies; the Department of Corrections, created in 1991, took responsibility of the adult correctional facilities and also absorbed the adult parole functions of the Wyoming Department of Probation and Parole.

The system is overcrowded. Starting in 2019, it has leased prison beds from a private facility in Mississippi. Female prisoners are housed in county jails or one of the state&#x27;s male prisons because of lack of capacity. Average staff turnover in recent years has been about 23%. The state has cut 180 staff positions from the system since 2011.

==Facilities==
Institutions include:

* Wyoming State Penitentiary (Rawlins)
* Wyoming Women&#x27;s Center (Lusk; inmate capacity 261)
* Wyoming Honor Farm (Riverton; inmate capacity 283)
* Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp &amp; Boot Camp (Newcastle; combined inmate capacity 261)
* Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution (Torrington)
** The grand opening and ribbon cutting occurred on January 6, 2010. It serves as an intake center for men who are not sentenced to death.

==Fallen officers==
Since the establishment of the Wyoming Department of Corrections, three officers have died in the line of duty.

<text>DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince were an American hip hop duo from West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, consisting of rapper and actor Will Smith (the Fresh Prince) and turntablist Jeff Townes (DJ Jazzy Jeff). Active full time from 1986 to 1994 and occasionally thereafter, the duo became just the third rap group in recording history to receive platinum certification, after Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; (1988), though their most successful single was &quot;Summertime&quot; (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Will Smith and Jeff Townes have remained close friends and claim they never split up, having made songs together under Smith&#x27;s solo performer credit. DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince have sold over 5.5 million albums in the US. Their latest performance dates back to November 2023.

==Career==

===1985–1988: early years and &quot;Rock the House&quot;===
Jeff Townes was introduced to Will Smith at a house party during a performance in 1985, and Smith ended up filling in for Townes&#x27; missing hype man. They both felt a strong chemistry, and Townes was disappointed when his hype man finally made it to the party.

Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend, Ready Rock C, to join as the beatboxer of the group. He was not officially credited to the duo, only as a support live member. In 1986, Philadelphia-based Word Records (later changed to Word-Up Records) released their first single &quot;Girls Ain&#x27;t Nothing but Trouble&quot;, which sampled the theme song of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling and profanity-free &quot;battle&quot; rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.

Based on this success, the duo was brought to the attention of Jive Records and Russell Simmons. The duo&#x27;s first album, &quot;Rock the House&quot; was released on Word Up in 1986 and rereleased on Jive in March 1987. The album sold approximately 300,000 units. That same year, the band embarked on its first major tour with Run DMC and Public Enemy.

===1988–1989: &quot;He&#x27;s the DJ, I&#x27;m the Rapper&quot;===

Their 1988 follow-up album, &quot;He&#x27;s the DJ, I&#x27;m the Rapper&quot;, made them multi-platinum stars. Mostly recorded in the United Kingdom, the album was a double-vinyl LP release; it was also issued as a single cassette and CD. &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, the lead-off single, made them MTV household names and also gained the honor of the first Grammy for a hip hop/rap song, which was met with criticism. Nevertheless, the single was a success, launching the group into even more mainstream stardom. The video showed Prince&#x27;s misadventures of trying to get around his parents&#x27; strict rules in a very comical way, much like their first single &quot;Girls Ain&#x27;t Nothing but Trouble&quot;. It gained considerable airplay on TV channels such as MTV, giving the group much attention. The song was played in an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (&quot;Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect (Part 1)&quot;), and referenced in two other episodes of the same series (&quot;The Fresh Prince Project&quot; and &quot;Not With My Pig, You Don&#x27;t&quot;).

Another single, &quot;A Nightmare on My Street&quot;, showcased a fictional confrontation with &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; villain Freddy Krueger. The record&#x27;s release coincided with &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;, which caused legal threats from the movie&#x27;s distributor New Line Cinema. In response, the corresponding music video was pulled from release and a legal disclaimer was included on later pressings of &quot;He&#x27;s the DJ, I&#x27;m the Rapper&quot; denying affiliation with the film. The video was released by Jazzy Jeff in 2018.

Jeff reveals on track 19 of Skillz&#x27;s &quot;Infamous Quotes mixtape&quot; that New Line Cinema approached Will &amp; Jeff for a role in the movie &quot;House Party&quot;, which they turned down. The last single, track 3 from &quot;He&#x27;s the DJ, I&#x27;m the Rapper&quot;, was &quot;Brand New Funk&quot;, which sampled and quoted the James Brown funk song &quot;My Thang&quot;. In narrative of the song, the Fresh Prince explains how Jeff has brought in a tape described to be startlingly good, which the Fresh Prince raps to, and how much people enjoyed it at the first performance. The song was well received by many hip hop fans due to its funk sound, lyrical spins, and the fact that it showed off more of the skills of Jazzy Jeff. The video was shot in black and white, showed live performance clips from a concert and featured 2 Damn Hype Dancing.

===1989–1990: &quot;And in This Corner...&quot;===
The group&#x27;s third LP, &quot;And in This Corner...&quot;, was released in 1989. The album was a commercial success, selling over half a million copies and reaching Gold certification by the RIAA, although at this point the duo had decreased in popularity. The crossover style of the group was causing their fanbase to decline, as their initial audience felt they had become too accessible; non-crossover rap acts like Big Daddy Kane and Boogie Down Productions had bigger street followings; meanwhile, pop radio had latched on to new faces like Tone Loc and Young MC, while non-radio followers were more attracted to hardcore acts such as Ice-T and 2 Live Crew. The lead single, &quot;I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson&quot;, was similar to their other lead singles. The track narrates the Fresh Prince claiming he could beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match, and after training, is beaten in the first round. The music video features cameos from Mike Tyson, Chris Rock and Don King.

The next single was &quot;Jazzy&#x27;s Groove&quot;, sampling &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the chorus and bridge. The song features much more of Jazzy Jeff, like in &quot;Brand New Funk&quot;; Jazzy Jeff gives a &#x27;math lesson&#x27; by making the sound clips add 1+1, 2+1, and 2+2. Due to a self-admitted spendthrift attitude, Smith felt he had nothing to lose when a producer from NBC and Quincy Jones approached him with an idea for a sitcom, with Townes appearing as a recurring character, named &quot;Jazz&quot;. A popular running gag would have Uncle Phil (James Avery) throwing Jazz out of the house; however, this action is not restricted to Uncle Phil, as other characters, even Will himself, have thrown him out in the same manner. Another trademark on the show involved Jazz and Will greeting each other by slapping each other&#x27;s hand, then swinging back in opposite directions while saying &quot;Pssh!&quot; &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; boosted his profile and his pocketbook. But Smith ended up squandering almost US$2.8m, while failing to pay any of it to the Internal Revenue Service in income taxation. Soon after &quot;And in This Corner...&quot; was released, Smith was found guilty of income-tax evasion by the IRS, and sentenced to pay this all back. For the first three seasons of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,&quot; Smith had 25% of his paycheck subjected to IRS garnishment.

In 1990, Ready Rock C decided not to continue as support. He later sued the duo alleging breach of contract, but lost in court.

===1991–1994: &quot;Homebase&quot;, &quot;Code Red&quot; and split===

Still having a bit of extra money from starring in the successful sitcom, the duo decided to stage a comeback album in 1991, &quot;Homebase&quot;. The platinum album featured a more mature sound from the group, with Smith rapping in a deeper, consistent voice and changed their sound to fit the era&#x27;s trend of hip-hop. &quot;Homebase&quot; featured the lead-off single &quot;Summertime&quot;, which added rap lyrics to the music of the Kool &amp; the Gang instrumental &quot;Summer Madness&quot; and has become one of their most enduring hits. The couple is seen being driven about while perched on a car in the film, which includes scenes from a family gathering in Philadelphia. The pair won their second Grammy for Summertime. &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; and &quot;Things That U Do&quot; were the ensuing singles. Both songs have the typical early 1990s&#x27; sound. A different rendition of each song from the one on the LP was featured in the videos.

The final single for the release was &quot;You Saw My Blinker&quot;, a song about an old lady that crashed into Prince&#x27;s new car and his anger at the events that happened thereafter. This is the first (and one of the only) songs where Smith curses, saying the word &#x27;bitch&#x27; (&quot;To the left lane I tried to switch, then, you saw my blinker, bitch&quot;). Prince&#x27;s voice is a bit deeper than usual, to make it sound like he&#x27;s agitated, similar to &quot;Then She Bit Me&quot; from &quot;And in This Corner...&quot; This song reached No. 20 Billboard Hot 100 and No. 22 Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop singles. In 1992 for the Barcelona Olympic Games the duo released the song &quot;Higher Baby&quot; as part of the compilation album &quot;Barcelona Gold&quot;.

&quot;Code Red&quot;, their last studio LP as a duo, was released in 1993, reaching gold sales. This LP featured a self-admitted harder sound than their other songs, with Jazzy Jeff saying &quot;We wanted to take a new direction. It wasn&#x27;t that we were concentrating on harder, it was just different&quot;, featuring more jazz and soul samples than previous releases. The lead single &quot;Boom! Shake the Room&quot; reached No. 1 in UK, Ireland, Spain and Australia, and featured a harder sound than any of their other songs. Other singles were &quot;I&#x27;m Looking For the One (To Be With Me)&quot;, which is similar to &quot;Summertime&quot;, and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot;, which showed off more of Jazzy Jeff&#x27;s DJ skills. Shortly afterward, Smith began to pursue acting full-time and the duo split. He and Townes ended up being sued by Jive, who alleged that the duo was still under contract to create more albums.

==Occasional appearances==
In 1998 the label released the compilation &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; with the hits and two previously unreleased songs. Years later, Will and Jazzy performed together sometimes in parties for close friends or selected events, but never announced a return as was credited as &quot;DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince&quot;. In 2005, Smith and Townes performed together at the Philadelphia leg of Live 8. They performed in Croatia on August 26, 2017, Blackpool on August 27, and in Smith&#x27;s 51st birthday on September 25, 2019. On November 8, 2023, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince performed at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood California for “ A Grammy salute to 50 Years of Hip-Hop”

<doc id="400975" wikidata="Q142274" url="?curid=400975" title="Sandpaper">
<text>Sandpaper, also known as coated abrasive, is a type of material that consists of sheets of paper or cloth with an abrasive substance glued to one face. In the modern manufacture of these products, sand and glass have been replaced by other abrasives such as aluminium oxide or silicon carbide. It is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper, e.g. &quot;aluminium oxide paper&quot;, or &quot;silicon carbide paper&quot;.

There are many varieties of sandpaper, with variations in the paper or backing, the material used for the grit, grit size, and the bond.

Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes and is used to remove material from surfaces, whether to make them smoother (for example, in painting and wood finishing), to remove a layer of material (such as old paint), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for gluing). The grit size of sandpaper is usually stated as a number that is inversely related to the particle size. A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a coarse grit, while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.

== History ==
The first recorded instance of sandpaper was in 13th-century China when crushed shells, seeds, and sand were bonded to parchment using natural gum.

Shark skin (placoid scales) has also been used as an abrasive, and the rough scales of the Coelacanth are used for the same purpose by the natives of Comoros. Boiled and dried, the rough horsetail plant is used in Japan as a traditional polishing material, finer than sandpaper.

Glass paper was manufactured in London in 1833 by John Oakey, whose company had developed new adhesive techniques and processes, enabling mass production. Glass frit has sharp-edged particles and cuts well whereas sand grains are smoothed down and do not work well as an abrasive. Cheap sandpaper was often passed off as glass paper; Stalker and Parker cautioned against it in &quot;A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing&quot; published in 1688.

In 1921, 3M invented a sandpaper with silicon carbide grit and a waterproof adhesive and backing, known as &quot;Wet and dry&quot;. This allowed use with water, which would serve as a lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit. Its first application was in automotive paint refinishing.

== Backing ==

In addition to paper, backing for sandpaper includes cloth (cotton, polyester, rayon), PET film, &quot;fibre&quot;, and rubber. Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while PET film is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or vulcanized fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F&quot;, with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.

== Fitting ==

A quick-change system is commonly used with disc-type coated abrasives. A plastic or metal hub is bonded to one of the faces, which is threaded. This then mates directly to the sander or angle grinder or to a mandrel that can be mounted in a sander, grinder, or drill. The advantage is that the disc can be quickly replaced when needed. Quick-change discs are available in sizes of about and larger.

== Abrasives ==


Common substrates are paper, cloth, vulcanized fiber, and plastic films and come in grit sizes range from very coarse (≈2 mm) to ultrafine (submicrometre). The international standard for coated abrasives is ISO 6344. Sandpaper and emery cloth are coated abrasives for hand use, usually non-precision. Other coated abrasive forms include sanding cords, pads, belts, and discs. Variants are available for use by hand or as components for power tools such as sanders, die grinders and belt sanders.

Types of abrasive materials include:

* Glass: No longer commonly used.
* Flint: No longer commonly used.
* Garnet: Commonly used in woodworking.
* Emery: Commonly used to abrade or polish metals.
* Aluminium oxide: The most common in modern use, with the widest variety of grits, lowest unit cost; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood.
* Silicon carbide: Available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications.
* Alumina-zirconia: (An aluminium oxide–zirconium oxide alloy), used for machine grinding applications.
* Chromium(III) oxide: Used in extremely fine micron grit (micrometre level) papers.
* Diamond: Used for finishing and polishing hard metals, ceramics and glass.
* Ceramic aluminium oxide: Used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.

Sandpaper may be &quot;stearated&quot; where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate &quot;soap&quot; prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper.

The harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of harder surfaces like hardwoods such as hickory, pecan, or wenge. The grit material for polishing granite must be harder than granite.

=== Emery ===
Emery cloth is a type of coated abrasive that has emery glued to a cloth backing. It is used for hand metalworking. It may be sold in sheets or in narrow rolls, typically 25 or 50 mm wide, often described as &quot;emery tape&quot;. The cloth backing makes emery cloth stronger in tension than paper, but still allows a sheet to be conveniently torn to size. Emery (largely displaced by improved products such as aluminium oxide and silicon carbide) is used for scrubbing highly abraded and rough surfaces to a smooth and shiny finish, notably in watchmaking. Emery paper, more commonly seen, has a paper backing and is usually a finer grit.

Emery was considered a suitable abrasive for fitting work and the final adjustment of steel parts for a perfect fit. It had the advantage that, unlike harder abrasives, it was not considered to embed abrasive traces in the polished components afterwards. Emery was also used for cleaning, as a means of removing rust from polished steel components.

Both emery cloth and paper are still sold in hardware and do it yourself stores, but have been largely supplanted by the increased use of machine grinding to precision size, which has minimized or eliminated the need for hand-fitting; the widespread availability of powered hand tools employing sanding and grinding accessories such as flapwheels; and a shift to other forms of abrasive, such as aluminium oxide, aluminium zirconia and silicon carbide.

Emery is rated on the average grit size, glued to the backing. Common sizes are, from coarse to fine: 40, 46, 54, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 180, 220, 320, F, and FF. A 46 or 54 grade cloth is used on roughly filed work, while 220 to 320 grit cloth will give a good polish.

By the successive use of progressively finer mesh emery paper, near-mirror finishes can be obtained. Water or oil is often used as a lubricant and to float the abrasive debris and worn abrasive away from the work, preventing the build-up of debris in the emery paper. The paper will lose effectiveness if too much debris builds up, a condition known as &quot;clogging&quot;, or &quot;loading&quot;.

Originally, emery paper was made from milled emery rock, bonded or sized to paper often with an animal glue for water resistance. Today, synthetic adhesives are used in place of natural glues and silicon carbide (SiC) is often substituted for emery, silicon carbide being slightly harder, and more durable with less tendency to fracture than corundum. The use of natural emery papers is rare today generally being replaced with silicon carbide or pure aluminium oxide papers.

Emery cloth has the abrasives bonded to a fabric instead of a paper. The cloth is more tear resistant, flexible, and costly. Emery boards have applications similar to emery paper or cloth. It also has a use in modelling. For 00 scale modelling, the fine grades of emery paper can have the appearance of a tarmac surface.

=== Crocus ===

Crocus cloth is an abrasive sheet similar to sandpaper or emery cloth but covered with a layer of very fine loose iron oxide particles rather than with bound grains of abrasive. It is intended for final metal and gemstone finishing and is available in various grades (particle sizes). Federal Specification P-C-458 described this material in detail, although the specification was cancelled in 1989.

== Wet and dry papers ==

Abrasive papers and cloths with a waterproof backing allow the use of a lubricant, typically water, which can both decapitate rough surfaces when used dry and produce a semi-polished satin type finish when wet. Super-fine grades can produce a &quot;key&quot; adhesion surface appropriate for spray painting in critical decorative applications such as automotive bodywork repair.

== Bonds ==

Different adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. Hide glue is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. Waterproof sandpapers or wet/dry sandpapers use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.

Sandpaper can be either &quot;closed coat&quot; or &quot;open coat&quot;. Approximately 90% to 95% of the surface is covered with abrasive grains with a closed coat. Closed coat sandpaper is good for hand sanding or working with harder materials. In comparison, 50% to 70% of the surface is covered with abrasive grains with open coat sandpaper. The separation between particles makes the sandpaper more flexible, which prevents the sandpaper from clogging. However, the gaps in grit coverage limits the sandpaper&#x27;s ability to perform even polishing jobs. Open coat sandpaper is better for softer materials.

Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface.

== Shapes ==
Sandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:

* Sheet: usually , but other sizes may be available
* Belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different belt sanders.
* Disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and &quot;hook-and-loop&quot; (similar to Velcro).
* Rolls: known as &quot;shag rolls&quot; by many contractors
* Sponge: for tight places

== Grit sizes ==

Grit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. These measurements are determined by the amount of the abrasive material that can fit through a square inch filter. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer&#x27;s Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) &quot;P&quot; grade. The FEPA system is the same as the ISO 6344 standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). Cheaper sandpapers may sometimes only use descriptive nomenclature such as &quot;coarse&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;fine&quot; without referring to any standard.

<doc id="400976" wikidata="Q4598087" url="?curid=400976" title="2000 millennium attack plots">
<text>A series of Islamist terrorist attacks linked to al-Qaeda were planned to occur on or near January 1, 2000, in the context of millennium celebrations, including bombing plots against four tourist sites in Jordan, the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), , and the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814.

In Lebanon, dozens were killed in clashes in the Dinnieh district between radical Islamists with connections to the Jordan plots and the Lebanese Army. The plots in Jordan and against LAX were foiled by law enforcement agencies, while the attempted bombing of &quot;The Sullivans&quot; only failed because the boat filled with explosives sank before detonating.

The revelation of the plot linked to the LAX &quot;Millennium Bomber&quot; Ahmed Ressam led to unprecedented investigations into other potential terrorist cells in the United States, dubbed Operation &quot;Borderbom&quot;, and security measures around millennium celebrations. Other al-Qaeda-linked millennium attack plots may have been planned or foiled around the same time.

==Millennium attack plots==

===Jordan bombing plots===
In Jordan, members of the Islamist terror organization al-Qaeda planned to bomb four sites: a fully booked Radisson hotel in Amman, Jordan; the border between Jordan and Israel; a Christian church on Mount Nebo; and a site on the Jordan River where John the Baptist is said to have baptized Jesus. These locations were chosen to target tourists from the United States and Israel. The most active participant was a Boston taxi driver named Raed Hijazi.

On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a call between Saudi citizen Abu Zubaydah, the leader of the plot, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian militant terrorist. In the conversation, Zubaydah stated, &quot;The time for training is over.&quot; Sensing that the attack was imminent, Jordanian police arrested Hoshar and fifteen others on December 12, 1999.

Jordanian authorities put twenty-eight suspects on trial. Twenty-two of them were quickly found guilty. Six of them, thought to be linked to Osama bin Laden, including Hijazi, were sentenced to death. Abu Zubaydah was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. Luai Sakra and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi were sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; in 2002 for their part in the plot, which included using poison gas during the bombing.

===LAX bombing plot===

Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian citizen living in Montreal, Canada, confessed after interrogation to having planned to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on New Year&#x27;s Eve. He was arrested by a U.S. Customs Service inspector at Port Angeles, Washington, a U.S. port of entry, on December 14, 1999. Customs officials found a cache of explosives that could have produced &quot;a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating car bomb&quot; and four timing devices hidden in the spare tire well in the trunk of the rented car in which he had traveled from Canada. Ressam later asserted that the plot was facilitated by Zubaydah and known to bin Laden.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted door-to-door interviews of up to 50 individuals across the country, made &quot;dozens of arrests&quot; as part of investigations into possible other individuals linked to the case, and reportedly &quot;questioned hundreds of Muslims from Los Angeles to Boston, wiretapped hundreds of conversations, and put hundreds of individuals under surveillance&quot;. Abdelghani Meskini, a known criminal was arrested in Brooklyn, New York on December 30 by Joint Terrorism Task Force for his links to Ressam. In New York and Boston, nine other Algerians linked to Meskini were arrested by the FBI, as part of the largest counter-terrorism operation ever conducted in the United States, dubbed Operation &quot;Borderbom&quot;. Most, including Meskini faced minor charges after no significant terrorism links could be proven, although a main suspected bomb-making accomplice, Abdelmajid Dahoumane had fled the country. Other suspected targets alleged by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sources included the Seattle Space Needle and Disneyland, California, with maps found with circles around &quot;three California airports—Los Angeles International, Long Beach and Ontario—as well as maps with San Francisco&#x27;s landmark Transamerica building and Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle.&quot;

Ressam began cooperating with investigators in 2001. He was initially sentenced to 22 years in prison, but in 2010 an appellate court reversed and remanded the case based on procedural errors and recommended that his sentence be extended. He was re-sentenced to 37 years&#x27; imprisonment in 2012. Another Algerian-Canadian, Mokhtar Haouari was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for assisting Ressam in the plot. Abu Doha was indicted for the plot, but was denied extradition from the United Kingdom.

===Hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814===

Indian Airlines Flight 814, en route from Kathmandu, Nepal to New Delhi, India was hijacked on December 24, 1999, by five militants of the al-Qaeda-linked Harkat-ul-Mujahideen group. The hijackers reportedly told the captain, &quot;Fly slowly, fly carefully, there is no hurry. We have to give India a millennium gift,&quot; as a bomb in the cargo room of the plane was timed to go off at midnight, December 31, 1999. The plane eventually landed in Taliban-controlled Kandahar, Afghanistan. On December 31, India agreed to release three captive militants in exchange for the nearly 200 passengers and crew that were being held hostage.

===Lebanon and Syria clashes===

On December 31, 1999, attacks were launched by a group of up to 300 radical Islamists against Lebanese Army forces in the Dinnieh district in northern Lebanon. The group behind the attack, calling itself after the apocalyptic Takfir wal-Hijra group was led by Bassam Kanj, a close associate of Raed Hijazi who had been indicted for his involvement in the Jordan bombing plots. Kanj had met Hijazi in the Khalden training camp in Afghanistan, and they later worked for the same Boston taxi company in the United States in the 1990s. The fighting lasted for eight days, and killed eleven soldiers, five civilians, and 28 Islamists.

Lebanon being under Syrian occupation at the time, the Lebanon clashes followed clashes in Syria between Syrian security forces and Islamists, some of whom were accused of infiltrating the country from Jordan and Saudi Arabia, that began on December 30 when several Syrian intelligence agents were ambushed and killed. The clashes lasted for four days in Damascus, Homs and nearby villages, and the Hizb ut-Tahrir group claimed that 1,200 of its members had been arrested by January 2000.

===USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; bombing attempt===
On January 3, 2000, in Yemen, members of al-Qaeda attempted to use a boat with explosives to damage the warship while it was refueling in Aden. The attempt failed when the over-loaded, bomb-laden boat sank before detonating.

Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Al Badawi and Fahd al-Quso were charged &quot;in absentia&quot; in United States district court in 2003 for their alleged roles in several terrorist acts, including the attempted bombing of &quot;The Sullivans&quot;. In 2011, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, held in Guantanamo, was charged with planning the attack on &quot;The Sullivans&quot; along with other attacks, facing death penalty.

===Other plots===
According to National Security Advisor of the Clinton administration, Sandy Berger, terrorist cells had been disrupted in &quot;eight countries&quot; in the weeks before New Year&#x27;s Eve, which was said to have &quot;almost certainly&quot; prevented additional attacks. The man behind the LAX plot, Ahmed Ressam, claimed there had been plans by other terrorist cells of millennium attacks &quot;in Europe, in the Gulf, against U.S. and Israel.&quot; Major security operations were launched to improve security for the millennium celebrations in Times Square, New York, along with several other cities in the United States and Europe.

In anticipation of the turn to the new millennium, official concerns by the FBI and U.S. authorities had focused on purported threats by &quot;apocalyptic&quot; religious or political groups, claimed to include lone wolf white supremacists, Christian apocalyptic cults or radical elements of militia organizations.

==Aftermath==
===Investigation===
While in prison, Ressam revealed that al-Qaeda sleeper cells existed within the United States. This information was included in the President&#x27;s Daily Brief delivered to President George W. Bush on August 6, 2001, entitled &quot;Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US&quot;.

FBI special agent and counter-terrorism chief John P. O&#x27;Neill, who had been central in the investigation of al-Qaeda in the late 1990s and the millennium plot, and subsequently suspected the existence of sleeper cells in the United States, died in the September 11 attacks in 2001 as head of security of the World Trade Center. O&#x27;Neill had started his new job on August 23 less than a month before the attack, after he had been squeezed out of the bureau.

On July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating former National Security Advisor of the Clinton administration, Sandy Berger, for unauthorized removal of classified documents in October 2003 from a National Archives reading room prior to testifying before the 9/11 Commission. The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from Richard A. Clarke, covering internal assessments of the Clinton administration&#x27;s handling of the plots. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003.

===Attacks===
After the unsuccessful attack on USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, al-Qaeda attempted the same type of attack for a second time, again in Aden, Yemen. They successfully bombed on October 12, 2000, in an attack that claimed the lives of seventeen U.S. sailors.

The Radisson SAS hotel in Amman, Jordan, which was the target of a millennium attack plot, was one of three hotels in the city that were bombed by al-Qaeda in 2005. Thirty-eight people were killed in the bombing, which was the deadliest of the three hotels attacked.

<doc id="400982" wikidata="Q557745" url="?curid=400982" title="White-throated robin">
<text>The white-throated robin (Irania gutturalis), or irania, is a small, sexually dimorphic, migratory passerine bird. The vernacular and genus name Irania alludes to Iran, its type locality, while the specific name &quot;gutturalis&quot; is Medieval Latin for &quot;of the throat&quot;. It breeds in western Asia and overwinters in East Africa.

==Relationships==
It was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, family Muscicapidae. It, and similar passerine species, are often called chats.

==Description==
This species is larger than the European robin, having a length of and a wingspan of . The breeding male has lead-grey upperparts, a black face with a white throat and supercilium, and orange underparts. The tail is black, as is the strong bill. Females are plainer, mainly grey apart from a black tail, hints of orange on the flanks, and some white throat streaks.

==Song==
The male&#x27;s song is a fast twittering, given from a bush or in flight. The call of this species is a &quot;chis-it&quot; double note, like that of the pied wagtail.

==Food==
Though it is insectivorous, it will also eat fruit during autumn.

==Range and habitat==
It is a migratory species, breeding from Turkey to Afghanistan in western Asia, and wintering in East Africa. In East Africa they are found in closed thicket in dry country, typically &quot;Acacia&quot;-&quot;Commiphora&quot; woodland on the dry central plateau. Small numbers reach the Usangu Plains of Ruaha National Park in Tanzania, which is normally their southern limit. In dry years however, some may move still further south, and reach moister uplands at 1,600 metres. It is also a very rare vagrant to Europe.

==Breeding==
The white-throated robin&#x27;s breeding habitat is dry rocky slopes with some bushes, often at some altitude. It nests in a shrub, laying 4-5 eggs.

<doc id="400991" wikidata="Q1400226" url="?curid=400991" title="Peter Fraser">
<text>Peter Fraser (; 28 August 1884 – 12 December 1950) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 24th prime minister of New Zealand from 27 March 1940 until 13 December 1949. Considered a major figure in the history of the New Zealand Labour Party, he was in office longer than any other Labour prime minister, and is to date New Zealand&#x27;s fourth-longest-serving head of government.

Born and raised in the Scottish Highlands, Fraser left education early in order to support his family. While working in London in 1908, Fraser joined the Independent Labour Party, but unemployment led him to emigrate to New Zealand in 1910. On arrival in Auckland, he gained employment as a wharfie and became involved in union politics upon joining the New Zealand Socialist Party. In 1916, Fraser was involved in the foundation of the unified Labour Party. He spent one year in jail for sedition after speaking out against conscription during the First World War. In 1918, Fraser won a Wellington by-election and entered the House of Representatives.

Fraser became a cabinet minister in , serving under Michael Joseph Savage. He held several portfolios and had a particular interest in education, which he considered vital for social reform. As Minister of Health, he introduced the Social Security Act 1938, which established a universal health care service. Fraser became the Leader of the Labour Party and prime minister in 1940, following Savage&#x27;s death in office.

Fraser is best known for leading the country during the Second World War when he mobilised New Zealand supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. He formed a war cabinet which included several erstwhile political opponents. Labour suffered significant losses in the election, though the party retained its majority.

Following the war, Fraser was active in the affairs of the &#x27;new&#x27; Commonwealth and is credited with increasing New Zealand&#x27;s international stature. Fraser led his party to its fourth successive election victory in , albeit with a further reduced majority. The after-effects of the war, including ongoing shortages, were affecting his government&#x27;s popularity. Labour lost the and Fraser&#x27;s government was succeeded by the first National Party government. Almost exactly one year later, Fraser died from a heart attack aged 66.

==Early life==
A native of Scotland, Peter Fraser was born in Hill of Fearn, a small village near the town of Tain in the Highland area of Easter Ross. He received a basic education, but had to leave school due to his family&#x27;s poor financial state. Though apprenticed to a carpenter, he eventually abandoned this trade due to extremely poor eyesight – later in life, faced with difficulty reading official documents, he would insist on spoken reports rather than written ones. Before the deterioration of his vision, however, he read extensively – with socialist activists such as Keir Hardie and Robert Blatchford among his favourites.

Becoming politically active in his early teens, he was 16 years old upon attaining the post of secretary of the local Liberal Association, and, eight years later, in 1908, joined the Independent Labour Party.

==Move to New Zealand==
In another two years, at the age of 26, after unsuccessfully seeking employment in London, Fraser decided to move to New Zealand, having apparently chosen the country in the belief that it possessed a strong progressive spirit.

He gained employment as a stevedore (or &quot;wharfie&quot;) on arrival in Auckland, and became involved in union politics upon joining the New Zealand Socialist Party. Fraser worked as campaign manager for Michael Joseph Savage as the Socialist candidate for Auckland Central electorate. He was also involved in the New Zealand Federation of Labour, which he represented at Waihi during the Waihi miners&#x27; strike of 1912. He moved to Wellington, the country&#x27;s capital, shortly afterwards. Savage went on to be Fraser&#x27;s predecessor in office as the nation&#x27;s first Labour prime minister.

In 1913, he participated in the founding of the Social Democratic Party and, during the year, within the scope of his union activities, found himself under arrest for breaches of the peace. While the arrest led to no serious repercussions, it did prompt a change of strategy – he moved away from direct action and began to promote a parliamentary route to power.

Upon Britain&#x27;s entry into the First World War, he strongly opposed New Zealand participation since, sharing the belief of many leftist thinkers, Fraser considered the conflict an &quot;imperialist war&quot;, fought for reasons of national interest rather than of principle.

==Foundation of the Labour Party==
In 1916, Fraser became involved in the foundation of the New Zealand Labour Party, which absorbed much of the moribund Social Democratic Party&#x27;s membership. The members selected Harry Holland as the Labour Party&#x27;s leader. Michael Joseph Savage, Fraser&#x27;s old ally from the New Zealand Socialist Party, also participated.

Later in 1916, the government had Fraser and several other members of the new Labour Party arrested on charges of sedition. This resulted from their outspoken opposition to the war, and particularly their call to abolish conscription. Fraser received a sentence of one year in jail. He always rejected the verdict, claiming he would only have committed subversion had he taken active steps to undermine conscription, rather than merely voicing his disapproval.

After his release from prison, Fraser worked as a journalist for the official Labour Party newspaper. He also resumed his activities within the Labour Party, initially in the role of campaign manager for Harry Holland.

==Local body politics==
In 1919 Fraser stood on the Labour Party&#x27;s ticket for the Wellington City Council. He and three others were first Labour candidates to win office on the council since before the war. Fraser led a movement on the council to establish a municipal milk distribution department in Wellington, which was to remain in operation until the 1990s. He was re-elected in 1921, though Labour lost ground only winning two seats. In 1923 Fraser stood for Mayor of Wellington. He adopted an &quot;all or nothing&quot; strategy by standing only for the mayoralty, refusing nomination to stand for the council also. Fraser polled higher than any Labour mayoral candidate in New Zealand history but lost by only 273 votes to Robert Wright in the closest result Wellington had ever seen.

Fraser made a comeback on the council when he was persuaded to stand in a 1933 by-election. Wright was his main opponent and was victorious in a heavy polling contest which was dubbed by the media as a &quot;grudge match&quot; repeat of 1923. Fraser was re-elected to the Council in 1935, topping the poll with more votes than any other candidate. The next year he decided to resign from the council in order to focus on his ministerial duties. A by-election was avoided when Andrew Parlane, also the highest polling unsuccessful candidate from 1935, was the only nominated candidate.

==Early parliamentary career==




In a 1918 by-election, Fraser gained election to Parliament, winning the electorate of . He soon distinguished himself through his work to counter the influenza epidemic of 1918–19, of which Fraser was himself a survivor.

During his early years in parliament, Fraser developed a clearer sense of his political beliefs. Although initially enthusiastic about the Russian October Revolution of 1917 and its Bolshevik leaders, he rejected them soon afterwards, and eventually became one of the strongest advocates of excluding communists from the Labour Party. His commitment to parliamentary politics rather than to direct action became firmer, and he had a moderating influence on many Labour Party policies.

Fraser&#x27;s views clashed considerably with those of Harry Holland, still serving as leader, but the party gradually shifted its policies away from the more extreme left of the spectrum. Fraser soon became convinced that political action via parliamentary process was the only realistic course of action to achieve Labour movement ambitions. As a result, he accepted the inevitable compromises (which Holland did not) that the attainment of parliamentary success required.

In 1933, however, Holland died, leaving the leadership vacant. Fraser considered contesting it, but eventually endorsed Michael Joseph Savage, Holland&#x27;s more moderate deputy. Fraser became the new deputy leader. While Savage represented perhaps less moderate views than Fraser, he lacked the extreme ideology of Holland. With Labour now possessing a &quot;softer&quot; image and the existing conservative coalition struggling with the effects of the Great Depression, Savage&#x27;s party succeeded in winning the and forming a government.

Fraser served as vice-president of the Labour Party in 1919–1920, and as party president in 1920–1921.

==Cabinet minister==

In the new administration, Fraser became the Minister of External Affairs, the Minister of Island Territories, Minister of Health, Minister of Education and Minister of Marine. He showed himself extremely active as a minister, often working seventeen hours a day, seven days a week. During his first years in cabinet, his wife, Janet, had an office next to his and worked as his research assistant and adviser in order that she could spend time with him. She would also prepare meals for him during his long days at parliament.

He had a particular interest in education, which he considered vital for social reform. His appointment of C.E. Beeby to the Education Department provided him with a valuable ally for these reforms. Fraser held a passionate belief that education had a huge part to play in the social reform he desired.

Fraser&#x27;s narrowly elitist and Anglophile cultural perspectives are illustrated by his crucial role in planning New Zealand&#x27;s 1940 Centennial celebrations. He used his cultural protege James Shelly, an Englishman who insisted that England was to be the source of New Zealand&#x27;s cultural life – and by &#x27;cultural&#x27; Shelley and Fraser meant so-called high culture sourced from England. As head of the 1940 Centennial Musical Celebrations Shelley followed Fraser in insisting the music would be &#x27;high&#x27; culture only. He reassured Fraser that &quot;established Musical Societies, who, throughout New Zealand’s history, have done such magnificent and effective work in developing and keeping alive that appreciation of good music which is so essential to the cultural development of the people of any country.&quot; To implement this the Government would import from England &quot;a Musical Adviser and a sufficient number of outstanding Soloists.&quot; The result:&quot;a sumtuous feast of good music.&quot; Neither Fraser nor Shelley contemplated involving New Zealand born performers and artists.
As Minister of Health, Fraser also became the driving force behind the 1938 Social Security Act. The Act proposed a comprehensive health care system, free at the point of use; it faced strong opposition, particularly from the New Zealand branch of the British Medical Association. Eventually, Fraser negotiated effectively enough to force the Association to yield. Fortunately for him, Janet Fraser had long volunteered in the health and welfare fields and was an invaluable adviser and collaborator.

When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Fraser had already taken over most of the functions of national leadership. Michael Joseph Savage had been ill for some time and was near death, although the authorities concealed this from the public. Fraser had to assume most of the Prime Minister&#x27;s duties in addition to his own ministerial ones. Internal disputes within the Labour Party made Fraser&#x27;s position more difficult. John A. Lee, a notable socialist within the Party, vehemently disapproved of the party&#x27;s perceived drift towards the political centre, and strongly criticised Savage and Fraser. Lee&#x27;s attacks, however, became strong enough that even many of his supporters denounced them. Fraser and his allies successfully moved to expel Lee from the Party on 25 March 1940.

==Prime minister==
When Savage died on 27 March, Fraser successfully contested the leadership against Gervan McMillan and Clyde Carr. He had, however, to give the party&#x27;s caucus the right to elect people to Cabinet without the Prime Minister&#x27;s approval – a practice which has continued as a feature of the Labour Party .

Despite the concession, Fraser remained in command, occasionally alienating colleagues due to a governing style described by some as &quot;authoritarian&quot;. Some of his determination to exercise control may have come about due to the war, on which Fraser focused almost exclusively. Nevertheless, certain measures he implemented, such as censorship, wage controls, and conscription, proved unpopular with the party. In particular, conscription provoked strong opposition, especially since Fraser himself had opposed it during the First World War. Fraser replied that fighting in the Second World War, unlike in the First World War, had indeed a worthy cause, making conscription a necessary evil. Despite opposition from within the Labour Party, enough of the general public supported conscription to allow its acceptance.

===Second World War===

Fraser was one of the immediate few in New Zealand who instantly grasped that war meant not merely the involvement of the military, but that of the whole country. These implications were not always recognised either by his own party or by the opposition. Fraser further developed somewhat of an authoritarian streak as a result; this reflected his insistence on the overwhelming importance of the war effort above all else.

During the war, Fraser attempted to build support for an understanding between Labour and its main rival, the National Party. However, opposition within both parties prevented reaching an agreement, and Labour continued to govern alone. Fraser did, however, work closely with Gordon Coates, a former prime minister and now a National-Party rebel – Fraser praised Coates for his willingness to set aside his party loyalty, and appears to have believed that National leader Sidney Holland placed the interests of his party before national unity.

In terms of the war effort itself, Fraser had a particular concern with ensuring that New Zealand retained control over its own forces. He believed that the more populous countries, particularly Britain, viewed New Zealand&#x27;s military as a mere extension of their own, rather than as the armed forces of a sovereign nation. After particularly serious New Zealand losses in the Greek campaign in 1941, Fraser determined to retain a say as to where to deploy New Zealand troops. Fraser insisted to British leaders that Bernard Freyberg, commander of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, should report to the New Zealand government just as extensively as to the British authorities.

When Japan entered the war in December 1941, Fraser had to choose between recalling New Zealand&#x27;s forces to the Pacific (as Australia had done) or keeping them in the Middle East (as British prime minister Winston Churchill requested). Opinion was divided on the question and New Zealand&#x27;s manpower resources were already stretched to capacity. Fraser received assurances from U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt that American forces would be made available for New Zealand&#x27;s defense. The local populace possessed an understandable view that the division&#x27;s proper place was defending their homes. Fraser weighed up public opinions against the strategic arguments involved and eventually opted to leave New Zealand&#x27;s Expeditionary Force where it was.

In a remarkable display of political acumen and skill, he then persuaded a divided government and Parliament to give their full support [to leave the army in Africa]. It was leadership of the highest order.
Fraser had a very rocky relationship with U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, particularly over the Canberra Pact in January 1944. Hull gave Fraser a sharp and rather demeaning dressing-down when Fraser visited Washington D.C. in mid-1944, which resulted in New Zealand&#x27;s military becoming sidelined to some extent in the conduct of the Pacific War.

=== Furlough Mutiny ===
By early 1943 Fraser faced a major military and strategic problem that also had significant political implications in this New Zealand election year. The New Zealand Division, part of the Eighth Army in North Africa, were now battle-weary. The bulk of the Division had been overseas for almost three years. Nearly 43% of the troops had suffered casualties. &quot;The men were homesick, exhausted and war-weary.&quot;

In 1943 Fraser arranged for 6,000 men to return home from the Mediterranean theatre for a three-month furlough (period of military leave), anticipating that the grateful men and their families would be more disposed to vote Labour in the general election. Upon arrival, however, many of the veterans were furious at the numbers in reserved occupations, some of whom were making menial goods of no use to the war effort. Moreover, unions had ensured that bonuses and high pay were awarded to munitions workers, far in excess of the money paid to the men in combat. &quot;No man twice before every man first&quot; became one of the returning soldiers&#x27; mantras, and several thousand of them secured an exemption from further service due to age or being married.

A number of the remainder were court-martialed, sentenced to 90 days&#x27; imprisonment and forced to return (though some had deserted and were not able to be found. Further, they were denied a military pension and refused government jobs. Due to censorship, the public heard little of the protests and the affair, known as the &quot;Furlough Mutiny&quot;, was omitted from post-war history books for many years.

=== Trans-Tasman relationship ===
Fraser&#x27;s government also established a far closer working understanding with the Labor government in Australia. He signed the Australian–New Zealand Agreement of 1944, in which Fraser, under pressure by Australia&#x27;s foreign minister, H. V. Evatt, overplayed his hand seeking to ensure that both Australian and New Zealand interests in the Pacific would not be overlooked in the war or its aftermath. New Zealand and Australia were both anxious to have their input in the planning of the Pacific War, and later in the decisions of the &quot;Great Powers&quot; in the shaping of the post-war world.

===Post-war===
After the war ended, Fraser devoted much attention to the formation of the United Nations at the San Francisco conference (UNCIO) in 1945; this &quot;was the apogee of Fraser&#x27;s career&quot;. Noteworthy for his strong opposition to vesting powers of veto in permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, he often spoke unofficially for smaller states. He was elected chairman of one of the main committees which was considering dependent territories, and next year in London was chairman of one of the social-economic committees at the first assembly in London. He earned the respect of many world statesmen through his commitment to principle, his energy, and most of all his skill as a chairman. It was to Fraser&#x27;s stature that New Zealand would later owe much of its favourable international reputation.

Fraser had a particularly close working relationship with Alister McIntosh, the head of the Prime Minister&#x27;s department during most of Fraser&#x27;s premiership and then of the Department of External Affairs, created in 1946. McIntosh privately described his frustration with Fraser&#x27;s workaholism, and with Fraser&#x27;s insensitivity towards officials&#x27; needs for private lives; but the two men had a genuinely affectionate relationship.

Fraser also took up the role of Minister of Native Affairs (which he renamed Māori Affairs) in 1947. Fraser had had an interest in Māori concerns for some time, and he implemented a number of measures designed to reduce inequality. The Maori Social and Economic Advancement Act, which he introduced in 1945, allowed Māori involvement and control over welfare programmes and other assistance.

===New Commonwealth===

Fraser&#x27;s Government had proposed to adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931 in its Speech from the Throne in 1944 (two years after Australia adopted the Act), in order to gain greater constitutional independence. During the Address-In-Reply debate, the opposition passionately opposed the proposed adoption, claiming the Government was being disloyal to the United Kingdom. National MP for Tauranga, Frederick Doidge, argued &quot;With us, loyalty is an instinct as deep as religion&quot;.

The proposal was buried. Ironically, the National opposition prompted the adoption of the Statute in 1947 when its leader and future prime minister Sidney Holland introduced a private members&#x27; bill to abolish the Legislative Council, the country&#x27;s upper house of parliament. Because New Zealand required the consent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to amend the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, Fraser decided to adopt the Statute with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947.

The adoption of the Statute of Westminster was soon followed by the debate on the future of the British Commonwealth in its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations. In April 1949 Ireland, formerly the Irish Free State, declared itself a republic and ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth. In response to this, the New Zealand Parliament passing the Republic of Ireland Act the following year, which treated Ireland as if it were still a member of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, newly independent India would have to leave the Commonwealth on becoming a republic also, although it was the Indian prime minister&#x27;s view that India should remain a member of the Commonwealth as a republic. Fraser believed that the Commonwealth could as a group address the evils of colonialism and maintain the solidarity of common defence.

To Fraser, the acceptance of India as a republican member would threaten the political unity of the Commonwealth. Fraser knew his domestic audience and was tough on republicanism or defence weakness to deflect criticism from the loyalist and imperialist-minded opposition National Party. Labour had been in office for fourteen years and faced an uphill battle to retain power against National at the general election, which would come just months after the high-profile April 1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference. In March 1949 Fraser wrote to the Canadian prime minister, Louis St Laurent, stating his frustration and unease over India&#x27;s position. Saint Laurent had indicated that he would not be able to attend the meeting where the issue of India&#x27;s republican status would dominate. Fraser argued:

Fraser left little doubt New Zealand was opposed to India&#x27;s membership as a republic when he stated to his colleagues at Downing Street:

The conference quashed a proposal of a two-tier structure that would have had the traditional Commonwealth realms, perhaps with defence pacts, on one tier, and the new members which opted for a republic, on the second tier. The final compromise is perhaps best seen from the title finally accepted for the King, as Head of the Commonwealth.

Fraser argued that the compromise allowed the Commonwealth dynamism, that would in the future allow former colonies of Africa to join as republics and be stalwarts of this New Commonwealth. It also allowed New Zealand the freedom to maintain its individual status of loyalty to the Crown and to pursue collective defence. Indeed, Fraser cabled a senior minister, Walter Nash, after the decision was taken to accept India that &quot;while the Declaration is not as I would have wished, it is on the whole acceptable and maximum possible, and does not at any rate leave our position unimpaired&quot;.

===Decline and defeat===

Although he relinquished the role of Minister of Education early in his term as prime minister, he and Walter Nash continued to have an active role in developing educational policy with C. E. Beeby.

Labour&#x27;s majority at the was reduced to one seat. The after-effects of the war were affecting his government&#x27;s popularity. Fraser moved to the Wellington seat of Brooklyn, which he held until his death. From 1940 to 1949 Fraser lived in a house &quot;Hill Haven&quot; at 64–66 Harbour View Road, Northland, Wellington, which had been purchased for the use of the then-ill Savage in 1939.

Fraser&#x27;s domestic policies came under criticism. His slow speed in removing war-time rationing and his support for compulsory military training during peacetime in the 1949 referendum particularly damaged him politically. Some thought this hypocritical compared to Fraser&#x27;s earlier sentiments on the subject. Much earlier in his career, in 1927 he is noted to have said that compulsory military training was &quot;out of date, inefficient and not worth the money spent on it&quot;.

With dwindling support from traditional Labour voters, and a population weary of war-time measures, Fraser&#x27;s popularity declined. At this stage of his career, Fraser relied heavily on the party &quot;machine&quot;. As a result, the gap between the party leadership and rank and file members widened to the point where Labour&#x27;s political enthusiasm dwindled. In the the National Party defeated his government.

==Leader of the Opposition==
Following the election defeat, Fraser became Leader of the Opposition, but declining health prevented him from playing a significant role. He died at the age of 66, exactly one year after leaving government. His successor as leader of the Labour Party was Walter Nash. His successor in the electorate, elected in the 1951 Brooklyn by-election, was Arnold Nordmeyer.

==Personal life==
On 1 November 1919, a year after his election to parliament, Fraser married Janet Kemp née Munro, from Glasgow and also a political activist. They remained together until Janet&#x27;s death in 1945, five years before Fraser&#x27;s own passing. During Fraser&#x27;s time as prime minister, Janet traveled with him and acted as a &quot;political adviser, researcher, gatekeeper and personal support system&quot;. Her ideas influenced his political philosophy. The couple had no children, although Janet had a son from her first marriage to George Kemp.

==Death==
Fraser died in Wellington on 12 December 1950 from a heart attack following hospitalisation with influenza. His death came the day before the first anniversary of his leaving the premiership. His body lay in state in the New Zealand Parliament Buildings for three days and a state funeral service was conducted by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church. He is buried in the Karori Cemetery.

==Honours==
In 1935, Fraser was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1937, he was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1940 and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1946.

In 2021, Janet Fraser and Peter Fraser, in recognition of their help for the Polish children were awarded by the President of Poland with Virtus et Fraternitas Medal.

<text>Mastitis is inflammation of the breast or udder, usually associated with breastfeeding. Symptoms typically include local pain and redness. There is often an associated fever and general soreness. Onset is typically fairly rapid and usually occurs within the first few months of delivery. Complications can include abscess formation.
Risk factors include poor latch, cracked nipples, and weaning. Use of a breast pump has historically been associated with Mastitis, but has been determined as an indirect association. The bacteria most commonly involved are &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptococci&quot;. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Ultrasound may be useful for detecting a potential abscess.
Prevention of this breastfeeding difficulty is by proper breastfeeding techniques. When infection is present, antibiotics such as cephalexin may be recommended. Breastfeeding should typically be continued, as emptying the breast is important for healing. Tentative evidence supports benefits from probiotics. About 10% of breastfeeding women are affected.

==Types==
When it occurs in breastfeeding mothers, it is known as puerperal mastitis, lactation mastitis, or lactational mastitis. When it occurs in non breastfeeding women it is known as non-puerperal or non-lactational mastitis. Mastitis can, in rare cases, occur in men. Inflammatory breast cancer has symptoms very similar to mastitis and must be ruled out.

The symptoms are similar for puerperal and nonpuerperal mastitis but predisposing factors and treatment can be very different.

===Pregnancy related===

Puerperal mastitis is the inflammation of the breast in connection with pregnancy, breastfeeding or weaning. Since one of the most prominent symptoms is tension and engorgement of the breast, it is thought to be caused by blocked milk ducts or milk excess. It is relatively common; estimates range depending on methodology between 5–33%. However, only about 0.4–0.5% of breastfeeding mothers develop an abscess.

Some predisposing factors are known but their predictive value is minimal. It appears that proper breastfeeding technique, frequent breastfeeding and avoidance of stress are the most important factors that can be influenced.

Light cases of mastitis are often called breast engorgement; the distinction is overlapping and possibly arbitrary or subject to regional variations.

===Non-pregnancy related===

The term nonpuerperal mastitis describes inflammatory lesions of the breast occurring unrelated to pregnancy and breastfeeding. This article includes description of mastitis as well as various kinds of mammary abscesses. Skin related conditions like dermatitis and foliculitis are a separate entity.

Names for non-puerperal mastitis are not used very consistently and include mastitis, subareolar abscess, duct ectasia, periductal inflammation, Zuska&#x27;s disease and others.

Periductal mastitis is a form of nonlactational mastitis, and is characterized by inflammation of the subareolar ducts. Although the cause of periductal mastitis is currently unknown, it is predicted that smoking may be related. This condition is mainly seen in young women but can also be seen in men.

==Signs and symptoms==
Lactation mastitis usually affects only one breast and the symptoms can develop quickly. It develops into three stages, from the initial stage, the pus formation stage, to the restoration stage. The signs and symptoms usually appear suddenly and they include:
* Breast tenderness or warmth to the touch
* General malaise or feeling ill
* Swelling of the breast
* Pain or a burning sensation continuously or while breast-feeding
* Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern
* Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or greater
* The affected breast can then start to appear lumpy and red.
Some women may also experience flu-like symptoms such as:
* Aches
* Shivering and chills
* Feeling anxious or stressed
* Fatigue

Contact should be made with a health care provider with special breastfeeding competence as soon as the patient recognizes the combination of signs and symptoms. Most of the women first experience the flu-like symptoms and just after they may notice a sore red area on the breast. Also, women should seek medical care if they notice any abnormal discharge from the nipples, if breast pain is making it difficult to function each day, or they have prolonged, unexplained breast pain.

===Breast abscess===

A breast abscess is a collection of pus that develops in the breast with various causes. During lactation, breast abscess develops only rarely, most sources cite about 0.4–0.5% of breastfeeding women. Known risk factors are age over 30, primiparous (first birth) and late delivery. No correlation was found with smoking status; however, this may be in part because far fewer smoking women choose to breastfeed. Antibiotics were not shown effective in prevention of lactation abscess but are useful to treat a secondary infection (see the section on the treatment of breast abscess in this article).

Keratinizing squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts may play a similar role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal subareolar abscess.

==Causes==
Since the 1980s mastitis has often been divided into non-infectious and infectious sub-groups. However, recent research suggests that it may not be feasible to make divisions in this way. It has been shown that types and amounts of potentially pathogenic bacteria in breast milk are not correlated to the severity of symptoms. Moreover, although only 15% of women with mastitis in Kvist et al.&#x27;s study were given antibiotics, all recovered and few had recurring symptoms. Many healthy breastfeeding women wishing to donate breast milk have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their milk but have no symptoms of mastitis.

===Risk factors===
Mastitis typically develops when the milk is not properly removed from the breast. Milk stasis can lead to the milk ducts in the breasts becoming blocked, as the breast milk is not being properly and regularly expressed. It has also been suggested that blocked milk ducts can occur as a result of pressure on the breast, such as tight-fitting clothing or an over-restrictive bra, although there is sparse evidence for this supposition. Mastitis may occur when the baby is not appropriately attached to the breast while feeding, when the baby has infrequent feeds or has problems suckling the milk out of the breast.

The presence of cracks or sores on the nipples increases the likelihood of infection. There is a possibility that infants carrying infectious pathogens in their noses can infect their mothers; the clinical significance of this finding is still unknown.

Mastitis can also develop due to contamination of a breast implant or any other foreign body, for example after nipple piercing. In such cases, the removal of the foreign body is indicated.

Women who are breastfeeding are at risk for developing mastitis especially if they have sore or cracked nipples or have had mastitis before while breastfeeding another baby. Also, the chances of getting mastitis increases if women use only one position to breastfeed or wear a tight-fitting bra, which may restrict milk flow Difficulties in getting a nursing infant to latch on to the breast can also increase the risk for mastitis.

Women with diabetes, chronic illness, AIDS, or an impaired immune system may be more susceptible to the development of mastitis.

===Infection===
Some women (approximately 15%) will require antibiotic treatment for infection which is usually caused by bacteria from the skin or the baby&#x27;s mouth entering the milk ducts through skin lesions of the nipple or through the opening of the nipple. Infection is usually caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Infectious pathogens commonly associated with mastitis are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot; spp. and Gram-negative bacilli such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. &quot;Salmonella spp.&quot;, mycobacteria, and fungi such as &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; have been identified in rare instances.

Recent research suggests that infectious pathogens play a much smaller role in the pathogenesis than was commonly assumed only a few years ago. Most detected pathogens are very common species that are natural part of the breast fauna and simple detection of their presence is not sufficient to prove a causative role. Furthermore, there are indications that treatment with antibiotics may have minimal impact, and over-all there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for treating lactational mastitis.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of mastitis and breast abscess can usually be made based on a physical examination. The doctor will also take into account the signs and symptoms of the condition.

However, if the doctor is not sure whether the mass is an abscess or a tumor, a breast ultrasound may be performed. The ultrasound provides a clear image of the breast tissue and may be helpful in distinguishing between simple mastitis and abscess or in diagnosing an abscess deep in the breast. The test consists of placing an ultrasound probe over the breast.

In cases of infectious mastitis, cultures may be needed in order to determine what type of organism is causing the infection. Cultures are helpful in deciding the specific type of antibiotics that will be used in curing the disease. These cultures may be taken either from the breast milk or of the material aspirated from an abscess.

Mammograms or breast biopsies are normally performed on women who do not respond to treatment or on non-breastfeeding women. This type of tests is sometimes ordered to exclude the possibility of a rare type of breast cancer which causes symptoms similar to those of mastitis.

===Differential diagnosis===

==== Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders ====
Some women who experience pain or other symptoms when breastfeeding, but who have no detectable signs of mastitis, may have a sensory processing disorder, postpartum depression, perinatal anxiety, dysphoric milk ejection reflex, an involuntary aversion to breastfeeding, or other mental health problems.

==== Breast cancer ====
Breast cancer may coincide with or mimic symptoms of mastitis. Only full resolution of symptoms and careful examination are sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of breast cancer.

The lifetime risk for breast cancer is significantly reduced for women who were pregnant and breastfeeding. Mastitis episodes do not appear to influence lifetime risk of breast cancer.

Mastitis does however cause great difficulties in diagnosis of breast cancer. Breast cancer may coincide with mastitis or develop shortly afterwards. All suspicious symptoms that do not completely disappear within 5 weeks must be investigated.

Breast cancer incidence during pregnancy and lactation is assumed to be the same as in controls. Course and prognosis are also very similar to age matched controls. However diagnosis during lactation is particularly problematic, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Some data suggest that noninflammatory breast cancer incidence is increased within a year following episodes of nonpuerperal mastitis and special care is required for follow-up cancer prevention screening. So far only data from short term observation is available and total risk increase can not be judged. Because of the very short time between presentation of mastitis and breast cancer in this study it is considered very unlikely that the inflammation had any substantial role in carcinogenesis, rather it would appear that some precancerous lesions may increase the risk of inflammation (hyperplasia causing duct obstruction, hypersensitivity to cytokines or hormones) or the lesions may have common predisposing factors.

A very serious type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer presents with similar symptoms as mastitis (both puerperal and nonpuerperal). It is the most aggressive type of breast cancer with the highest mortality rate. The inflammatory phenotype of IBC is thought to be mostly caused by invasion and blocking of dermal lymphatics, however it was recently shown that NF-κB target genes activation may significantly contribute to the inflammatory phenotype. Case reports show that inflammatory breast cancer symptoms can flare up following injury or inflammation making it even more likely to be mistaken for mastitis. Symptoms are also known to partially respond to progesterone and antibiotics, reaction to other common medications can not be ruled out at this point.

==Treatment==

=== Lactational mastitis ===
When mastitis is associated with breastfeeding, the treatment has to balance short-term reduction of symptoms with solving the underlying problems that caused mastitis. For example, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommends against trying to &quot;empty&quot; the breasts, whether through pushing the baby to feed more or through using a breast pump. It may reduce the feeling of being full or swollen in the short term, at the cost of triggering milk oversupply, which can cause a mastitis recurrence in the coming days and weeks.

==== Self-care ====
For breastfeeding women with breast engorgement or light mastitis, using a warm compress may be comfortable. However, by increasing blood flow to the area, warm compresses make the symptoms worse for other women. A cool compresses can reduce edema (swelling) and pain. In traditional folk medicine, the breast was sometimes cooled by placing a cabbage leaf on the breast, but this is now more commonly done with an ice pack or a wet washcloth.

Gentle massage (&quot;like petting a cat&quot;) may be comfortable and may reduce swelling. However, more aggressive rubbing can easily damage breast tissues that are already strained by mastitis, and that damage can increase swelling and pain. Excessive massage, like excessive use of a breast pump, may be a risk factor for recurrent mastitis.

Probiotics may or may not help, but they are believed not to be harmful. Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, may reduce inflammation.

==== Medical treatments ====
Antibiotics are appropriate only for bacterial mastitis, which may develop if non-infective mastitis does not improve. Antifungals are similarly only useful when a fungal infection, such as thrush, is present. Severe infections may require ordinary medical supportive care, such as intravenous fluids if the mother is unable to drink enough water or other fluids.

Therapeutic ultrasound may reduce swelling.

==== Ineffective and harmful treatments ====
The shape of swelling in a specific spot may make people suppose that the breasts contain simple tubes, and that one has become plugged. However, milk ducts are not simple tubes, and their interconnected anatomy makes it impossible for them to actually become plugged. Consequently, treatment does not include cutting, popping, or squeezing any so-called &quot;plugged&quot; ducts. There is no &quot;plug&quot; (e.g., of dried-out milk) to be removed. These localized swellings are usually caused by lymphatic congestion (non-milk body fluid accumulating in the breasts), alveolar edema (swelling in the part of the breast that produces milk), or mammary dysbiosis (changes to the breast&#x27;s microbiome), which can cause some narrowing, but not plugging, at the microscopic level. Breastfeeding at a normal level may provide temporary relief from the swelling without triggering milk oversupply. It is safer to treat nipple blebs (very small, usually pale colored, bumps of tissue on the end of the nipple) with topical steroids than by cutting the skin.

Any action that breaks the skin can cause an infection, which increases inflammation and may become serious.

Antibiotics do not prevent mastitis from recurring.

=== Nonpuerperal mastitis ===
Nonpuerperal mastitis is treated by medication and possibly aspiration or drainage (see in particular treatment of subareolar abscess and treatment of granulomatous mastitis). According to a BMJ best practice report, antibiotics are generally to be used in all mastitis cases unrelated to breastfeeding, with replacement of the antibiotics by an antifungal agent such as fluconazole in cases of deep fungal infections, and corticosteroids are to be used in case of granulomatous mastitis (with differential diagnosis to tuberculosis infection of the breast).

In idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, successful treatment includes invasive surgical procedures or less invasive treatment with steroid medications.

===Antibiotics for bacterial mastitis===
In lactational mastitis, antibiotics are not needed in the overwhelming majority of cases and should be used only for bacterial infections. For people with non-severe infections, dicloxacillin or cephalexin are recommended. For people with severe infections, vancomycin is recommended. The length of antibiotic treatment ranges anywhere from 5–14 days. The effects of antibiotics has not been well studied as of 2013.

A lactational phlegmon (area of inflammation) should be monitored for possible development into an abscess (walled-off area filled with pus from an infection).

=== Breast abscess ===
An abscess (or suspected abscess) in the breast may be treated by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (percutaneous aspiration) or by surgical incision and drainage; each of these approaches is performed under antibiotic coverage. In case of puerperal breast abscess, breastfeeding from the affected breast should be continued where possible.

For small breast abscesses, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration such as to completely drain the abscess is widely recognized as a preferred initial management.

One recommended treatment includes antibiotics, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the abscess with an 18 gauge needle, under saline lavage until clear. The exudate is then sent for microbiological analysis for identification of the pathogen and determination of its antibiotic sensitivity profile, which may in turn give an indication for changing the antibiotics. At follow-up, a mammography is performed if the condition has resolved; otherwise the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with lavage and microbiological analysis is repeated. If three to five aspirations still do not resolve the condition, percutaneous drainage in combination with placement of an indwelling catheter is indicated, and only if several attempts at ultrasound-guided drainage fail, surgical resection of the inflamed lactiferous ducts (preferably performed after the acute episode is over). It is noted, however, that even the excision of the affected ducts does not necessarily prevent recurrence.

Nonpuerperal breast abscesses have a higher rate of recurrence compared to puerperal breast abscesses. There is a high statistical correlation of nonpuerperal breast abscess with diabetes mellitus (DM). On this basis, it has recently been suggested that diabetes screening should be performed on patients with such abscess.

Although there are a number of recommendations regarding the treatment of breast abscesses, a 2015 review found insufficient evidence of whether needle aspiration is comparable to incision and drainage, or whether antibiotics should generally be given to women undergoing incision and drainage.

==Prevention==
Most efforts to prevent mastitis in breastfeeding women are believed to be ineffective or have a relatively small effect. Acupoint massage probably reduces the risk somewhat. Possibly effective prevention measures include taking probiotics, breast massage, and low-frequency pulse treatment. Ineffective methods included prophylactic antibiotics, topical treatments (mastitis is inflammation deep in the breast, so treating the skin is irrelevant), specialist breastfeeding education, and anti‐secretory factor‐inducing cereal.

==Prognosis==
Neither the presence of a fever nor the severity of symptoms at presentation do not predict outcome; women with sore or damaged nipples may need special attention.

==Epidemiology==
Mastitis is quite common among breastfeeding women. The WHO estimates that although incidences vary between 2.6% and 33%, the prevalence globally is approximately 10% of breastfeeding women. Most mothers who develop mastitis usually do so within the first few weeks after delivery. Most breast infections occur within the first or second month after delivery or at the time of weaning. However, in rare cases it affects women who are not breastfeeding.

== Terminology ==
Popular usage of the term &quot;mastitis&quot; varies by geographic region. Outside the US, it is commonly used for both puerperal (that is, occurring to breastfeeding mothers) and nonpuerperal (unrelated to breastfeeding) cases. In the US, &quot;mastitis&quot; usually refers to puerperal mastitis with fever or other symptoms of systemic infection (these symptoms are not necessarily caused by an actual infection). Lighter cases of puerperal mastitis, appearing a few days after birth, are often called breast engorgement. In the US, the term &quot;nonpuerperal mastitis&quot; is rarely used, and alternative names such as duct ectasia, subareolar abscess and plasma cell mastitis are more frequently used.

In this article, &quot;mastitis&quot; is used in the original sense of the definition as inflammation of the breast, with additional qualifiers where appropriate.

&quot;Chronic cystic mastitis&quot; is an older name for fibrocystic breast changes.

===Etymology and pronunciation===
The word &quot;mastitis&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;. The word &quot;mammitis&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;. They are synonymous in modern usage, and &quot;mastitis&quot; is the more commonly used synonym.

==Other animals==

Mastitis occurs in other animals as in humans, and is especially a concern in livestock, since milk from the affected udders of livestock may enter the food supply and pose a health risk.

It is a major condition in some species, like dairy cows. It is the cause of much unwanted suffering for the dairy cows. It is of tremendous economic importance for the dairy industry, and it is also of concern for public health. The same considerations apply to mastitis in sheep and goats and other milk-producing females. It is also of economic importance in the sow, but, in this species, it is not related to public health. In other domestic females (queen, mare, etc.), it is more an individual illness dealt with by veterinary practitioners.

<text>The Siberian blue robin (Larvivora cyane) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classified as a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to belong to the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. It and similar small European species are often called chats. Recent research suggests that this species and some other East Asian members of &quot;Luscinia&quot; should be classified in a new genus, together with the Japanese and Ryūkyū robins. The genus name &quot;Larvivora&quot; comes from the Neo-Latin &quot;larva&quot; meaning caterpillar and &quot;-vorus&quot; meaning eating (&quot;vorace&quot; to devour), and &quot;cyane&quot; is Latin for &quot;dark-blue&quot;.

This bird is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in the eastern Palearctic from Siberia and northern Mongolia, northeastern China, Korea and across to Japan. It winters in southern and south-eastern Asia and Indonesia.

The breeding habitat is coniferous forest with dense undergrowth, often beside rivers or at woodland edges. It feeds on the ground but is very &#x27;skulking&#x27;. In winter, this bird also tends to stay in dense vegetation.

This species is larger than the European robin. The breeding male is unmistakable with blue upperparts and white underparts. The female is much drabber, with brown upperparts and whitish underparts. Her dark eye stands out against the paler brown face.

This species is a very rare vagrant to Europe, and has vagrant status even as far east as Pakistan.

The Siberian blue robin was previously placed in the genus &quot;Luscinia&quot;. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that &quot;Luscinia&quot; was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including the Siberian blue robin were moved to the reinstated genus &quot;Larvivora&quot;.

<text>Sialkot (Punjabi, ) is a city located in Punjab, Pakistan. It is the capital of the Sialkot District and the 12th most populous city in Pakistan. The boundaries of Sialkot are joined by Jammu in the north east, the districts of Narowal in the southeast, Gujranwala in the southwest and Gujrat in the northwest. Sialkot is known as the city of Allama Iqbal.

Sialkot is believed to be the successor city of Sagala, the capital of the Madra kingdom which was destroyed by Alexander the Great in 326 BCE. It was made capital of the Indo-Greek kingdom by Menander I in the 2nd century BCE — a time during which the city greatly prospered as a major center for trade and Buddhist thought. In the 6th century CE, it again become capital of the Taank Kingdom, which ruled Punjab for the next two centuries. Sialkot continued to be a major political center until it was eclipsed by Lahore around the turn of the first millennium CE. Sialkot was the capital of the Punjabi Muslim ruler Jasrat Khokhar who reigned over most of Punjab and Jammu in the early 15th century. Under the Mughal Empire, especially Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign, Sialkot became known as a great centre of Islamic scholarship and thought, and attracted scholars because of the widespread availability of paper in the city.

Sialkot city is the birthplace of Muhammad Iqbal (the National poet of Pakistan) and Asghar Sodai (the poet behind the famous slogan ‘Pakistan Ka Matlab Kya La Ilaha Ill Allah’) who were both leading figures of the Pakistan Movement.

The city has been noted for its entrepreneurial spirit and productive business climate which have made Sialkot an example of a small Pakistani city that has emerged as a &quot;world-class manufacturing hub.&quot; The relatively small city exported approximately $2.5 billion worth of goods in 2017, or about 10% of Pakistan&#x27;s total exports. The city has been labeled as the &quot;Football manufacturing capital of the World&quot;, as it produces over 70% of all footballs manufactured in the world. Sialkot is also home to the Sialkot International Airport; Pakistan&#x27;s first privately owned public airport.

==History==
===Ancient===
====Founding====

Sialkot was the likely capital of the Madra Kingdom Sagala, Sakala (), or Sangala () mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, a Sanskrit epic of ancient India, as occupying a similar area as Greek accounts of Sagala. The city may have been inhabited by the &quot;Saka&quot;, or Scythians, from Central Asia who had migrated into the Subcontinent. The region was noted in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; for the &quot;loose and Bacchanalian&quot; women who lived in the woods there. The city was said to have been located in the &quot;Sakaladvipa&quot; region between the Chenab and Ravi rivers, now known as the &quot;Rechna&quot; Doab.

==== Greek ====
The &quot;Anabasis of Alexander&quot;, written by the Roman-Greek historian Arrian, recorded that Alexander the Great captured ancient Sialkot, recorded as Sagala, from the &quot;Cathaeans,&quot; who had entrenched themselves there. The city had been home to 80,000 residents on the eve of Alexander&#x27;s invasion, but was razed as a warning against any other nearby cities that might resist his invasion.

==== Indo-Greek ====

The ancient city was rebuilt, and made capital by the Indo-Greek king Menander I of the Euthydemid dynasty, in the 2nd century BCE. The rebuilt city was shifted slightly from the older city, as rebuilding on exactly the same spot was considered inauspicious.

Under Menander&#x27;s rule, the city greatly prospered as a major trading centre renowned for its silk. Menander embraced Buddhism in Sagala, after an extensive debating with the Buddhist monk Nagasena, as recorded in the Buddhist text &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;. the text offers an early description of the city&#x27;s cityscape and status as a prosperous trade centre with numerous green spaces. Following his conversion, Sialkot developed as a major centre for Buddhist thought.

Ancient Sialkot was recorded by Ptolemy in his 1st century CE work, &quot;Geography,&quot; in which he refers to the city as Euthymedia (&quot;Εύθυμέδεια&quot;).

==== Alchon Huns ====
Around 460 CE, the Alchon Huns invaded the region from Central Asia, forcing the ruling family of nearby Taxila to seek refuge in Sialkot. Sialkot itself was soon captured, and the city was made a significant centre of the Alchon Huns around 515, during the reign of Toramana. During the reign of his son, Mihirakula, the empire reached its zenith. The Alchon Huns were defeated in 528 by a coalition of princes led by Prince Yashodharman

==== Late antiquity ====
The city was visited by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang in 633, who recorded the city&#x27;s name the &quot;She-kie-lo.&quot; Xuanzang reported that the city had been rebuilt approximately 15 &quot;li,&quot; or 2.5 miles, away from the city ruined by Alexander the Great. During this time, Sialkot served as the political nucleus of the North Punjab region. The city was then invaded in 643 by princes from Jammu, who held the city until the Muslim invasions during the medieval era.

===Medieval===
Around the year 1000, Sialkot began to decline in importance as the nearby city of Lahore rose to prominence. Following to fall of Lahore to the Ghaznavid Empire in the early 11th century, the capital of the Hindu Shahi empire was shifted from Lahore to Sialkot. Ghaznavid expansion in northern Punjab encouraged local Khokhar tribes to stop paying tribute to the Rajas of Jammu.

Sialkot became a part of the medieval Sultanate of Delhi after Muhammad Ghauri conquered Punjab in 1185. Ghauri was unable to conquer the larger city of Lahore, but deemed Sialkot important enough to warrant a garrison. He also extensively repaired the Sialkot Fort around the time of his conquest of Punjab, and left the region in charge of Hussain Churmali while he returned to Ghazni. Sialkot was then quickly laid siege to by Khokhar tribesmen, and Khusrau Malik, the last Ghaznavid sultan, though he was defeated during Ghauri&#x27;s return to Punjab in 1186.

In the 1200s, Sialkot was the only area of western Punjab that was ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate in Delhi. The area had been captured by the Ghauri prince Yildiz, but was recaptured by Sultan Iltutmish in 1217. Around 1223, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the last king of the Khwarazmian dynasty of Central Asia that had fled invasion of Genghis Khan there, briefly captured Sialkot and Lahore, before being driven out by Iltutmish&#x27;s forces towards Uch Sharif. During the 13th century, Imam Ali-ul-Haq, Sialkot&#x27;s most revered Sufi warrior-saint, arrived from Arabia, and began his missionary work in the region that successfully converted large numbers of Hindus to Islam, thereby transforming Sialkot into a largely Muslim city. The saint later died in battle, and is revered as a martyr.

Sialkot became capital of Punjabi warlord and ruler Jasrat Khokhar&#x27;s kingdom in the early 15th century. Jasrat Khokhar conquered most of Punjab from the Delhi sultanate in a series of campaigns between 1421 and 1442. He also conquered Jammu after defeating its ruler Bhim Dev in 1423. This was the golden period of Sialkot. Later, Sultan Bahlul Lodi captured the city after Jasrat Khokhar&#x27;s death and granted custodianship of the city to Jammu&#x27;s Raja Biram Dev, after he helped Bahlol in defeating the Khokhars. Sialkot was sacked by Malik Tazi Bhat of Kashmir, who attacked Sialkot after the governor of Punjab, Tatar Khan, had left the city undefended during one of his military campaigns.

Sialkot was captured by armies of the Babur in 1520, when the Mughal commander Usman Ghani Raza advanced towards Delhi during the initial conquest of Babur. Babur recorded a battle with Gujjar raiders, who had attacked Sialkot, and allegedly mistreated its inhabitants. In 1525–1526, Alam Khan, uncle of Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, invaded from Afghanistan, and was able to capture Sialkot with the aid of Mongol forces.

===Pre-modern===
==== Mughal ====
Abdul Hakim Sialkoti was a 16th-17th century Mughal-era Islamic scholar, Islamic theologian and Islamic philosopherfrom Sialkot. He became the most influential Islamic scholar in the Mughal imperial court, and taught in the imperial &quot;madrassa.&quot; After Abdul Hakim Sialkoti&#x27;s death in 1656, his son Maulvī Abdullah became chief scholar of Sialkot, and his &quot;madrassa&quot; became a centre of learning.

During the early Mughal era, Sialkot was made part of the &quot;subah,&quot; or &quot;province&quot;, of Lahore. According to Sikh tradition, Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, visited the city, sometime in the early 16th century. He is said to have met Hamza Ghaus, a prominent Sufi mystic based in Sialkot, at a site now commemorated by the city&#x27;s Gurdwara Beri Sahib.

During the Akbar era, Sialkot&#x27;s &quot;pargana&quot; territory was placed in the &quot;jagir&quot; custodianship of Raja Man Singh, who would repair the city&#x27;s fort, and sought to increase its population and develop its economy. In 1580 Yousuf Shah Chak of Kashmir sought refuge in the city during his exile from the Valley of Kashmir. Paper-makers from Kashmir migrated to the city during the Akbar period, and Sialkot later became renowned as the source of the prized Mughal &quot;Hariri&quot; paper – known for its brilliant whiteness and strength. The city&#x27;s metalworkers also provided the Mughal crown with much of its weaponry.

During the reign of Jahangir, the post was given to Safdar Khan, who rebuilt the city&#x27;s fort, and oversaw a further increase in Sialkot&#x27;s prosperity. Numerous fine houses and gardens were built in the city during the Jehangir period. During the Shah Jahan period, the city was placed under the rule of Ali Mardan Khan.

The last Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, appointed Ganga Dhar as &quot;faujdar&quot; of the city until 1654. Rahmat Khan was then placed in charge of the city, and would build a mosque in the city. Under Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign, Sialkot became known as a great centre of Islamic thought and scholarship, and attracted scholars because of the widespread availability of paper in the city.

==== Post-Mughal ====
Following the decline of the Mughal empire after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, Sialkot and its outlying districts were left undefended and forced to defend itself. In 1739, the city was captured by Nader Shah of Persia during his invasion of the Mughal Empire. The city was placed under the governorship of Zakariya Khan, the Mughal Viceroy of Lahore, who in return for the city promised to pay tribute to the Persian crown. After that Nader Shah went to India where in Karnal, Rao Bal Kishan fought against him with their 5000 soldiers who hails from Ahirwal on 24, Feb 1739 . Seen this Nader Shah shocked but impressed by Rao Bal Kishan fighting skills. Lastly when Nadirshah reached Delhi he told Muhammad Shah about Rao Bal Kishan Bravery, on which Muhammad Shah ordered to make a &quot;Chhatri&quot; to honour Rao Bal Kishan at Karnal which still can be found.
In the wake of the Persian invasion, Sialkot fell under the control of Pashtun powerful families from Multan and Afghanistan – the Kakayzais and Sherwanis. Sialkot was crept upon by Ranjit Deo of Jammu, who pledged nominal allegiance to the Mughal crown in Delhi. Ranjit Deo did not conquer Sialkot city from the Pashtun families which held the city, but switched allegiance to the Pashtun ruler Ahmed Shah Durrani in 1748, effectively ending Mughal influence in Sialkot. The city and three nearby districts were amalgamated into the Durrani Empire.

==== Sikh ====
Sikh chieftains of the Bhangi &quot;Misl&quot; state encroached upon Sialkot, and had gained full control of the Sialkot region by 1786, Sialkot was portioned into 4 quarters, under the control of Sardar Jiwan Singh, Natha Singh, Sahib Singh, and Mohar Singh, who invited the city&#x27;s dispersed residents back to the city.

The Bhangi rulers engaged in feuds with the neighbouring Sukerchakia &quot;Misl&quot; state by 1791, and would eventually lose control of the city. The Sikh Empire of Ranjit Singh captured Sialkot from Sardar Jiwan Singh in 1808. Sikh forces then occupied Sialkot until the arrival of the British in 1849.

=== Modern ===
====British====

Sialkot, along with Punjab as a whole, was captured by the British following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. During the British era, an official is known as The Resident who would, in theory, advise the Maharaja of Kashmir would reside in Sialkot during the wintertime.

During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the two Bengal regiments based in Sialkot rebelled against the East India Company, while their native servants also took up arms against the British. 

In 1877, the Sialkot native poet Allama Iqbal, who is credited for inspiring the Pakistan Movement, was born into a Kashmiri family that had converted to Islam from Hinduism in the early 1400s. He is considered to be one of the leading Islamic thought leaders and Islamic revivalists of the 20th century, and is also widely regarded as having animated the pulse for the Pakistan Movement. The leading religiopolitical slogan for the Pakistan Movement, Pakistan ka matlab kya, La Illaha Il-Allah was coined in 1943 by another Sialkot native poet, Asghar Sodai. 

In August 1947, nine years after Iqbal&#x27;s death, the partition of India gave way to the establishment of Pakistan, a newly independent Islamic state in which Iqbal is honoured as the national poet. He is also known in Pakistani society as &quot;&quot; () and as (). The anniversary of his birth (&quot;Yom-e Weladat-e Muḥammad Iqbal&quot;), 9 November, is observed as a public holiday in Pakistan.

Sialkot&#x27;s modern prosperity began during the colonial era. The city had been known for its paper making and ironworks prior to the colonial era, and became a centre of metalwork in the 1890s. Surgical instruments were being manufactured in Sialkot for use throughout British India by the 1920s. The city also became a centre for sports goods manufacturing for British troops stationed along with the North West Frontier due to the availability of nearby timber reserves.

The British-Raj fought in The Second Boer War. A concentration camp in Sialkot held the detained Boer Prisoners-of-War.

As a result of the city&#x27;s prosperity, large numbers of migrants from Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir came to the city in search of employment. At the end of World War II, the city was considered the second most industrialised in British Punjab, after Amritsar. Much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure was paid for by local taxes, and the city was one of the few in British India to have its own electric utility company.

====Partition====
The couplet and religiopolitical slogan Pakistan ka matlab kya, La Illaha Il-Allah ( — ; &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;What does Pakistan mean?... There is no God but Allah&quot;) was a couplet and political slogan coined in 1943 by Sialkot born and raised poet Asghar Sodai. The slogan became a battle cry and greeting for the Muslim League, which was struggling for an independent country for the Muslims of South Asia, when World War II ended and the independence movement geared up. This slogan shows the religious identity of Pakistan too.

The first communal riots between Hindus/Sikhs and Muslims took place on 24 June 1946, a day after the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan as a separate state. Sialkot remained peaceful for several months while communal riots had erupted in Lahore, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Rawalpindi. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement.

While Muslim refugees had poured into the city escaping riots elsewhere, Sialkot&#x27;s Hindu and Sikh communities began fleeing in the opposite direction towards India. They initially congregated in fields outside the city, where some of Sialkot&#x27;s Muslims would bid farewell to departing friends. Hindu and Sikh refugees were unable to exit Pakistan towards Jammu on account of conflict in Kashmir, and were instead required to transit via Lahore.

====Post-independence====
After independence in 1947 the Hindu and Sikh minorities migrated to India, while Muslim refugees from India settled in Sialkot. The city had suffered significant losses as a result of communal rioting that erupted because of Partition. 80% of Sialkot&#x27;s industry had been destroyed or abandoned, and the working capital fell by an estimated 90%. The city was further stressed by the arrival of 200,000 migrants, mostly from Jammu, who had arrived in the city.

Following the demise of industry in the city, the government of West Pakistan prioritised the re-establishment of Punjab&#x27;s decimated industrial base. The province lead infrastructure projects in the area, and allotted abandoned properties to newly arrived refugees. Local entrepreneurs also rose to fill the vacuum created by the departure of Hindu and Sikh businessmen. By the 1960s, the provincial government laid extensive new roadways in the district, and connected it to trunk roads to link the region to the seaport in Karachi.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, when Pakistani troops arrived in Kashmir, the Indian Army counterattacked in the Sialkot Sector. The Pakistan Army successfully defended the city and the people of Sialkot came out in full force to support the troops. In 1966, Government of Pakistan awarded a special flag of Hilal-e-Istaqlal to Sialkot, along with Lahore and Sargodha in Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]for showing severe resistance in front of enemy as these cities were target of enemy&#x27;s advances. Every year on Defence Day, this flag is hoisted in these cities as a symbol of recognition of the will, courage and perseverance of the dwellers of these cities. The armoured battles in the Sialkot sector like the Battle of Chawinda were the most intense since the Second World War.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Sialkot features a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, with four seasons. The post-monsoon season from mid-September to mid-November remains hot during the daytime, but nights are cooler with low humidity. In the winter from mid-November to March, days are mild to warm, with occasionally heavy rainfalls occurring. Temperatures in winter may drop to , but maxima are very rarely less than .
===Cityscape===
Sialkot&#x27;s core is composed of the densely populated old city, while north of the city lies the vast colonial era Sialkot Cantonment – characterised by wide streets and large lawns. The city&#x27;s industries have evolved in a &quot;ribbon-like&quot; pattern along the cities main arteries, and are almost entirely dedicated to export. The city&#x27;s sporting good firms are not concentrated in any part of the city, but are instead spread throughout Sialkot. Despite the city&#x27;s overall prosperity, the local government has failed to meet Sialkot&#x27;s basic infrastructure needs.

== Demographics ==
=== Religion ===
Sialkot is a religiously homogenous city with 96 percent of its population being Muslim and following Islam. The principal minority is Christians who make up 3.77 percent of the population. During the 13th century, Imam Ali-ul-Haq, Sialkot&#x27;s most revered Sufi warrior-saint, arrived from Arabia, and began his Dawah in the region that successfully converted large numbers of the native population to Islam, thereby transforming Sialkot into a largely Muslim city. The saint later died in battle, and is revered as a Shahid by the locals. 


== Economy ==
Sialkot is a wealthy city relative to the rest of Pakistan, with a GDP (nominal) of $13 Billions and a per capita income in 2021 estimated at $18500. The city was considered to be one of British India&#x27;s most industrialised cities, though its economy would later be largely decimated by violence and capital flight following the Partition. The city&#x27;s economy rebounded, and Sialkot now forms part of the relatively industriazised region of northern Punjab that is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Golden Triangle.&quot;

Sialkot has been noted by Britain&#x27;s &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine as a &quot;world-class manufacturing hub&quot; with strong export industries. As of 2017, Sialkot exported US$2.5 billion worth of goods which is equal to 10% of Pakistan&#x27;s total exports (US$25 billion). 250,000 residents are employed in Sialkot&#x27;s industries, with most enterprises in the city being small and funded by family savings. Sialkot&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce had over 6,500 members in 2010, with most active in the leather, sporting goods, and surgical instruments industry. The Sialkot Dry Port offers local producers quick access to Pakistani Customs, as well as to logistics and transportation. 

Despite being cut off from its historic economic heartland in Kashmir, Sialkot has managed to position itself into one of Pakistan&#x27;s most prosperous cities, exporting up to 10% of all Pakistani exports. Its sporting goods firms have been particularly successful, and have produced items for global brands such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and Puma. Balls for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2018 FIFA World Cup and 2022 FIFA World Cup were made by Forward Sports, a Sialkot-based company. The city has been labeled as the &quot;Football manufacturing capital of the World&quot;, as it produces over 70% of all footballs manufactured in the world.

Sialkot&#x27;s business community has joined with the local government to maintain the city&#x27;s infrastructure, as the local government has limited capacity to fund such maintenance. The business community was instrumental in the establishment of Sialkot&#x27;s Dry Port in 1985, and further helped re-pave the city&#x27;s roads. Sialkot&#x27;s business community also largely funded the Sialkot International Airport—opened in 2011 as Pakistan&#x27;s first privately owned public airport.

Sialkot is also the only city in Pakistan to have its very own commercial airline, Airsial. This airline is managed by the business community of Sialkot based at the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industries and offers direct flights from Sialkot to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

=== Industry ===

Sialkot is the world&#x27;s largest producer of hand-sewn footballs, with local factories manufacturing 40–60 million footballs a year, amounting to roughly 60% of world production. Since the 2014 FIFA World Cup, footballs for the official matches are being made by Forward Sports, a company based in Sialkot. Clustering of sports goods industrial units has allowed for firms in Sialkot to become highly specialised, and to benefit from joint action and external economies. There is a well-applied child labour ban, the Atlanta Agreement, in the industry since a 1997 outcry, and the local industry now funds the Independent Monitoring Association for Child Labour to regulate factories.

Sialkot is also the world&#x27;s largest centre of surgical instrument manufacturing. Sialkot was first noted to be a centre of metalwork in the 1890s, and the city&#x27;s association with surgical instruments came from the need to repair, and subsequently manufacture, surgical instruments for the nearby Mission hospital. By the 1920s, surgical instruments were being manufactured for use throughout British India, with demand boosted by further by World War II.

The city&#x27;s surgical instrument manufacturing industry benefits from a clustering effect, in which larger manufacturers remain in close contact with smaller and specialised industries that can efficiently perform contracted work. The industry is made up of a few hundred small and medium size enterprises, supported by thousands of subcontractors, suppliers, and those providing other ancillary services. The bulk of exports are destined for the United States and European Union.

Sialkot first became a centre for sporting goods manufacturing during the colonial era. Enterprises were initially inaugurated for the recreation of British troops stationed along the North West Frontier. Nearby timber reserves served to initially allure the industry to Sialkot. The city&#x27;s Muslim craftsmen generally manufactured the goods, while Sikh and Hindu merchants of the Sindhi &quot;Bania&quot;, &quot;Arora&quot;, and Punjabi &quot;Khatri&quot; castes acted like middle men to bring goods to market. Sialkot now produces a wide array of sporting goods, including footballs and hockey sticks, cricket gear, gloves that are used in international games comprising the Olympics and World Cups.

Sialkot is also noted for its leather goods. Leather for footballs is sourced from nearby farms, while Sialkot&#x27;s leather workers craft some of Germany&#x27;s most prized leather &quot;lederhosen&quot; trousers.

Sialkot also has a large share in the agricultural sector. It predominantly produces Basmati rice varieties, wheat and sugarcane. Its area is , at least are under cultivation. Potato and sunflower were evident among the minor crops of the district.

=== Public-Private Partnerships ===
Sialkot has a productive relationship between the civic administration and the city&#x27;s entrepreneurs, that dates to the colonial era. Sialkot&#x27;s infrastructure was paid for by local taxes on industry, and the city was one of the few in British Raj to have its own electric utility company.

Modern Sialkot&#x27;s business community has assumed responsibility for developing infrastructure when the civic administration is unable to deliver requested services. The city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce established the Sialkot Dry Port, the country&#x27;s first dry-port in 1985 to reduce transit times by offering faster customs services. Members of the Chamber of Commerce allowed paid fees to help resurface the city&#x27;s streets. The Sialkot International Airport was established by the local businesses community, is the only private airport in Pakistan.

== Transportation ==
=== Highways ===
A dual-carriageway connects Sialkot to the nearby city of Wazirabad, with onward connections throughout Pakistan via the N-5 National Highway, while another dual carriageway connects Sialkot to Daska, and onwards to Gujranwala and Lahore. Sialkot and Lahore are also connected through the motorway M11.

=== Rail ===
The Sialkot Junction railway station is the city&#x27;s main railway station and is serviced by the Wazirabad–Narowal Branch Line of the Pakistan Railways. The Allama Iqbal Express travels daily from Sialkot to Karachi via Lahore, and then back to Sialkot.

=== Air ===
The Sialkot International Airport is located about 20 km from the center of the city near Sambrial. It was established in 2007 by spending 4 billion rupees by Sialkot business community. It is Pakistan&#x27;s only privately owned public airport, and offers flights throughout Pakistan, with also direct flights to Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, France, the UK and Spain.

==Notable people==
==Awards==
In 1966, the Government of Pakistan awarded a special flag, the Hilal-i-istaqlal to Sialkot (also to Sargodha and Lahore) for showing severe resistance to the enemy during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 as these cities were targets of the Indian aggression. Every year on Defence Day (6 September), this flag is hoisted in these cities in recognition of the will, courage and perseverance of their people.

<text>This article covers the historical timeline of project management. There is a general understanding that the history of modern project management started around 1950. Until 1900, projects were generally managed by creative architects and engineers themselves, among those, for example, Christopher Wren, Thomas Telford and Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

== Early civilizations ==
* 2570 BC Great Pyramid of Giza completed. Some records remain of how the work was managed: e.g. there were managers of each of the four faces of the pyramid, responsible for their completion (subproject managers). 
* 208 BC The first major construction of the Great Wall of China.

== 17th - 19th century ==
* Christopher Wren (1632–1723) was a 17th-century English designer, astronomer, geometer, mathematician-physicist and architect. Wren designed 55 of 87 London churches after the Great fire of London in 1666, such as St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1710, as well as many secular buildings.
* Thomas Telford (1757-1834) was a Scottish stonemason, architect and civil engineer and a road, bridge and canal builder, who managed the Ellesmere Canal and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.
* Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–1859) was a British engineer who created the Great Western Railway, a series of steamships, such as the first with a propeller, and numerous bridges and tunnels.

== 20th century ==
* 1910s The Gantt chart developed by Henry Laurence Gantt (1861–1919)

;1950s
* 1950s The Critical path method (CPM) invented
* 1950s The US DoD used modern project management techniques in their Polaris project.
* 1956 The American Association of Cost Engineers (now AACE International) formed
* 1958 The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) method invented
;1960s
* 1969 Project Management Institute (PMI) launched to promote project management profession

;1970s
* 1975 PROMPT methodology (acronym for &quot;Project Resource Organisation Management Planning Technique&quot;) created by Simpact Systems Ltd (source: PRINCE2 manual)
* 1975 &quot;The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering&quot; by Fred Brooks published

;1980s
* 1984 &quot;The Goal&quot; by Eliyahu M. Goldratt published
* 1986 Scrum was named as a project management style in the article &quot;The New New Product Development Game&quot; by Takeuchi and Nonaka
* 1987 First &quot;Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide&quot; published as a white paper by PMI
* 1989 PRINCE method derived from PROMPTII is published by the UK Government agency CCTA and becomes the UK standard for all government information projects

;1990s
* 1996 PRINCE2 published by CCTA (now Office of Government Commerce OGC) as a generic product management methodology for all UK government projects.
* 1997 &quot;Critical Chain&quot; by Eliyahu M. Goldratt published

== 21st century ==
* 2001 AgileAlliance formed to promote &quot;lightweight&quot; software development projects
* 2006 Total Cost Management Framework release by AACE
* 2009 PRINCE2 2009 edition, compatible with other methods and more flexible in approach

<doc id="401005" wikidata="Q131567" url="?curid=401005" title="Marmot">
<text>Marmots are large ground squirrels in the genus Marmota, with 15 species living in Asia, Europe, and North America. These herbivores are active during the summer, when they can often be found in groups, but are not seen during the winter, when they hibernate underground. They are the heaviest members of the squirrel family.

==Description==

Marmots are large rodents with characteristically short but robust legs, enlarged claws which are well adapted to digging, stout bodies, and large heads and incisors to quickly process a variety of vegetation. While most species are various forms of earthen-hued brown, marmots vary in fur coloration based roughly on their surroundings. Species in more open habitat are more likely to have a paler color, while those sometimes found in well-forested regions tend to be darker. Marmots are the heaviest members of the squirrel family. Total length varies typically from about and body mass averages about in spring in the smaller species and in autumn, at times exceeding , in the larger species. The largest and smallest species are not clearly known. In North America, on the basis of mean linear dimensions and body masses through the year, the smallest species appears to be the Alaska marmot and the largest is the Olympic marmot. Some species, such as the Himalayan marmot and Tarbagan marmot in Asia, appear to attain roughly similar body masses to the Olympic marmot, but are not known to reach as high a total length as the Olympic species. In the traditional definition of hibernation, the largest marmots are considered the largest &quot;true hibernators&quot; (since larger &quot;hibernators&quot; such as bears do not have the same physiological characteristics as obligate hibernating animals such as assorted rodents, bats and insectivores).

==Biology==
Some species live in mountainous areas, such as the Alps, northern Apennines, Carpathians, Tatras, and Pyrenees in Europe; northwestern Asia; the Rocky Mountains, Black Hills, the Cascade and Pacific Ranges, and the Sierra Nevada in North America; and the Deosai Plateau in Pakistan and Ladakh in India. Other species prefer rough grassland and can be found widely across North America and the Eurasian Steppe. The slightly smaller and more social prairie dog is not classified in the genus &quot;Marmota&quot;, but in the related genus &quot;Cynomys&quot;.

Marmots typically live in burrows (often within rockpiles, particularly in the case of the yellow-bellied marmot), and hibernate there through the winter. Most marmots are highly social and use loud whistles to communicate with one another, especially when alarmed.

Marmots mainly eat greens and many types of grasses, berries, lichens, mosses, roots, and flowers.
== Subgenera and species ==
The following is a list of all &quot;Marmota&quot; species recognized by Thorington and Hoffman plus the recently defined &quot;M. kastschenkoi&quot;. They divide marmots into two subgenera.

Some extinct species of marmots are recognized from the fossil record, for example:

*†&quot;Marmota arizonae&quot;, Arizona, U.S.
*†&quot;Marmota minor&quot;, Nevada, U.S.
*†&quot;Marmota vetus&quot;, Nebraska, U.S.

==History and etymology==


Marmots have been known since antiquity. Research by the French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed the story of the &quot;Gold-digging ant&quot; reported by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who lived in the fifth century BCE, was founded on the golden Himalayan marmot of the Deosai Plateau and the habit of local tribes such as the Brokpa to collect the gold dust excavated from their burrows.
Some historians believe that Strabo&#x27;s , and Agatharchides&#x27;s , most probably are the marmot.

An anatomically accurate image of a marmot was printed and distributed as early as 1605 by Jacopo Ligozzi, who was noted for his images of flora and fauna.

The etymology of the term &quot;marmot&quot; is uncertain. It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix &quot;marm-&quot;, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is postclassical Latin, , meaning &quot;mountain mouse&quot;.

Beginning in 2010, Alaska celebrates February 2 as &quot;Marmot Day&quot;, a holiday intended to observe the prevalence of marmots in that state and take the place of Groundhog Day.

===Relationship to the Black Death===
Some historians and paleogeneticists have postulated that the &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; variant that caused the Black Death pandemic that struck Eurasia in the 14th century originated from a variant for which marmots in China were the natural reservoir species.

<doc id="401010" wikidata="Q5982908" url="?curid=401010" title="Ian Sinclair">
<text>Ian McCahon Sinclair (born 10 June 1929) is an Australian former politician who served as a Member of Parliament for 35 years, and was leader of the National Party from 1984 to 1989. He served as either a minister or opposition frontbencher for all but a few months from 1965 to 1989, and later Speaker of the House of Representatives from March to August 1998.

Sinclair was born in Sydney and studied law at the University of Sydney. He later bought a farming property near Tamworth. Sinclair was elected to parliament in 1963, and added to the ministry in 1965 as part of the Menzies Government. Over the following six years, he held various portfolios under Harold Holt, John McEwen, John Gorton and William McMahon. Sinclair was elected deputy leader of his party in 1971. He was a senior member of the Fraser government, spending periods as Minister for Primary Industry (1975–1979), Minister for Communications (1980–1982), and Minister for Defence (1982–1983). In 1984, Sinclair replaced Anthony as leader of the Nationals. He led the party to two federal elections, in 1984 and 1987, but was replaced by Charles Blunt in 1989. Sinclair was father of the parliament from 1990 until his retirement at the 1998 election. He spent his final six months in parliament as Speaker of the House of Representatives, following the sudden resignation of Bob Halverson; he is the only member of his party to have held the position. He also served as co-chair of the 1998 constitutional convention, alongside Barry Jones.

Along with Peter Nixon, Sinclair is the only other surviving Country/Nationals MP elected in the 1960s, and he is the last surviving minister who served in the Menzies Government and the First Holt Ministry. He is entitled to the Right Honourable prefix as one of the few surviving Australian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Sinclair was born in Sydney on 10 June 1929. He was the son of Gertrude Hazel (née Smith) and George McCahon Sinclair. His father was a chartered accountant who also served as deputy mayor of Ku-ring-gai Council, chairman of Knox Grammar School, and an elder of the Presbyterian Church.

Sinclair attended Knox Grammar before going on to the University of Sydney, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1949 and Bachelor of Laws in 1952. He served in the No. 22 Squadron RAAF from 1950 to 1952, as part of the Citizen Air Force. Sinclair served his articles of clerkship with Norton Smith &amp; Co., but did not pursue a legal career. He instead took up a grazing property near Bendemeer and set up the Sinclair Pastoral Company, of which he became managing director. He was a director of the Farmers and Graziers&#x27; Co-operative Limited from 1962 to 1965.

Sinclair married Margaret Anne Tarrant in 1956, with whom he had one son and two daughters. She died of brain cancer in December 1967. He remarried on 14 February 1970 to Rosemary Fenton, who had been Miss Australia in 1960; they had one son together. His daughter Fiona married Liberal politician Peter King.

==Political career==
A member of the Country Party, Sinclair was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1961. He resigned in order to seek election to the House of Representatives at the 1963 federal election, retaining the Division of New England for the Country Party after the retirement of David Drummond.

===Government minister===

In 1965, Sinclair was appointed Minister for Social Services in the Menzies Government, replacing Hugh Roberton. He stood for the deputy leadership of the Country Party after the 1966 federal election, but was defeated by Doug Anthony. In 1968, he became Minister for Shipping and Transport in the Gorton government. When Country Party leader John McEwen retired in February 1971, Anthony was elected as his replacement and Sinclair defeated Peter Nixon for the deputy leadership. He was appointed Minister for Primary Industry. A month later, William McMahon replaced John Gorton as Liberal leader and prime minister. McMahon wanted Sinclair to become Minister for Foreign Affairs, but for various reasons had to keep him in the primary industry portfolio and appoint Les Bury as foreign minister instead. Sinclair did later serve as acting foreign minister in Bury&#x27;s absence.

In 1973, Sinclair was one of the six Country MPs to vote in favour of John Gorton&#x27;s motion calling for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. After spending the three years of the Whitlam Labor government in opposition, he again became Minister for Primary Industry in 1975, in the Fraser government. In 1977, Sinclair was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

====Finnane Report and aftermath====

In 1978, New South Wales Attorney-General Frank Walker appointed Michael Finnane to inquire into the financial dealings of Sinclair&#x27;s father George, who had died in January 1976. The Finnane Report, which was tabled in the Parliament of New South Wales on 27 September 1979, alleged that Ian Sinclair had improperly loaned himself money from companies he controlled, attempted to conceal the loans, and forged his father&#x27;s signature on company returns. As a result, Sinclair resigned from the ministry. His supporters criticised the report on several grounds, including that the inquiry was conducted in secret, that its release prejudiced Sinclair&#x27;s right to a fair trial, and that it was politically biased as both Walker and Finnane were members of the ALP.

In April 1980, Sinclair was charged with nine counts of fraud, relating to forging, uttering, and making false statements on company returns. He was found not guilty on all charges on 15 August 1980, following a 23-day trial in the District Court of New South Wales.

Sinclair returned to the ministry in August 1980 as Minister for Special Trade Representations. After the 1980 election he was made Minister for Communications. He was finally made Minister for Defence in May 1982, holding the position until the government&#x27;s defeat at the 1983 election.

===Party leader===
Doug Anthony announced his resignation as NCP leader in December 1983. Sinclair was elected as his replacement on 17 January 1984, defeating Stephen Lusher by an unspecified margin (the party did not release the results of leadership ballots). In an interview with &quot;Australian Playboy&quot; in July 1984, Sinclair acknowledged a previous extramarital relationship with socialite Glen-Marie North. Copies of the interview were distributed in his electorate during the 1984 election campaign. In the lead-up to the election, Sinclair controversially attributed the spread of HIV/AIDS in Australia to the Labor Party&#x27;s recognition of de facto relationships and normalisation of homosexuality. After the deaths of three babies from HIV-contaminated blood transfusions, he stated that &quot;if it wasn&#x27;t for the promotion of homosexuality as a norm by Labor, I am quite confident that the very tragic and sad passing on of the AIDS disease [...] to those three poor babies would not have occurred.

In 1985, Sinclair came into conflict with the National Farmers&#x27; Federation over his claims that the organisation did not have the support of farmers. He also came into conflict with the Liberal Party on a number of occasions. He publicly rejected calls for a Liberal–National party merger, citing the incompatibility of the National Party&#x27;s conservatism and the &quot;small-l liberal&quot; wing of the Liberal Party. In March 1986, he accused Liberals of undermining the leadership of John Howard and thereby harming the Coalition&#x27;s chances of victory. He denounced former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s support of sanctions against apartheid South Africa, accusing him of &quot;prejudice against Southern Africa and the whites there&quot;. Sinclair proclaimed a &quot;deep abhorrence&quot; of apartheid, but believed the sanctions were too &quot;heavy-handed&quot;. He supported the re-admission of South Africa to the United Nations, the lifting of the sporting boycott, the re-establishment of an Australian trade commission, and direct flights between Australia and South Africa.

In addition to his leadership of the National Party, Sinclair continued to be the opposition spokesman on defence. In August 1986, he suggested the formation of a Pacific trade bloc at a meeting of the International Democrat Union in Sydney. The proposal, also supported by shadow foreign minister Andrew Peacock, was designed to &quot;minimise the harmful policies of major protectionist trading nations&quot; like the U.S. and the European Communities. Later in the year, Sinclair questioned the value of ANZUS, stating that Australia should reconsider its commitments to New Zealand as it had become too isolationist. He also believed Australia should adopt a more assertive role than provided for in the Dibb Report. He opposed trade sanctions on Fiji following the 1987 coups d&#x27;état and was accused by foreign minister Bill Hayden of sympathising with the perpetrators.

In the lead-up to the 1987 election, Sinclair dealt with the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign, an ambitious bid by Queensland Joh Bjelke-Petersen, leader of his party&#x27;s most powerful state branch, to enter federal politics and become prime minister. The campaign &quot;derailed any semblance of non-Labor unity from the beginning of 1987&quot;, and caused a split in the Coalition. Due to an ensuing rash of three-cornered contests, Labor won an increased majority. After the election, the Queensland branch continued its efforts to oust Sinclair from the leadership.

In the late 1980s, Sinclair was drawn into the debate over the levels of Asian immigration to Australia, favouring a reduction in the number of Asians allowed into the country. In August 1988, he said:

&quot;What we are saying is that if there is any risk of an undue build-up of Asians as against others in the community, then you need to control it ... I certainly believe, that at the moment we need ... to reduce the number of Asians ... We don&#x27;t want the divisions of South Africa, we don&#x27;t want the divisions of London. We really don&#x27;t want the colour divisions of the United States.&quot;

A few days later he &quot;toned down his statements&quot; at the request of Howard and denied that he had specifically targeted Asians. The following month, following pressure from Howard, he sacked National Senate leader John Stone from the shadow ministry for making similar comments, &quot;with regret&quot;. This was seen by many in his party as a capitulation to the Liberals.

In May 1989, there were simultaneous leadership challenges in both Coalition parties, with Peacock displacing Howard as Liberal leader and Charles Blunt replacing Sinclair. The immediate trigger for Sinclair&#x27;s defeat was dissatisfaction with his conditional support for the Hawke government&#x27;s deregulation of the wheat industry. However, there was also a sense that it was time for a generational change in the party leadership. When Blunt lost his seat at the 1990 election, Sinclair made an attempt to regain the NPA leadership, but was defeated by Tim Fischer, and retired to the back bench. He was thus the first NPA leader since the formation of the Coalition to have never served as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.

===Post-leadership and Speakership===
Sinclair underwent a double heart bypass surgery in September 1991. In March 1993, aged 63, ten days after the Coalition lost the 1993 federal election, Sinclair unsuccessfully challenged Tim Fischer for the party leadership.

By 1993, Sinclair was the Father of the House, the only sitting MP to have served with Robert Menzies, and &quot;the last of the Right Honourables&quot; (MPs with membership in the Privy Council). He was seen as a candidate for the speakership if the Coalition won the 1993 election, however this did not eventuate. In June 1997 Howard appointed Sinclair as co-chairman of the Constitutional Convention, alongside Barry Jones, which debated the possibility of Australia becoming a republic; the Convention reported in February 1998 and set the basis for the 1999 Australian republic referendum. A staunch monarchist, Sinclair was a leading advocate for the successful &#x27;No&#x27; campaign. Aged nearly 70, Sinclair announced his intention to retire from Parliament at the next federal election. When Speaker Bob Halverson suddenly resigned in March, Sinclair was elected to replace him, the first National to hold the post. He served as speaker for the last six months of his term, during which he usually wore an academic gown.

On his first day in office, he faced a motion of dissent from Labor opposition frontbencher Simon Crean when he ruled Labor MP Janice Crosio&#x27;s question out of order; the dissent motion was not carried and Sinclair&#x27;s ruling upheld. On 2 April, he named Crean apparently for shaking his head, although Sinclair maintained it was due to &quot;disorderly conduct&quot;. When another Labor frontbencher Martin Ferguson remarked &quot;You are a disgrace!&quot; he was also subsequently named, for refusing to withdraw an &quot;objectionable remark when directed to do so by the Chair&quot;.

Sinclair became Speaker during a controversial time for Parliament; as a result, he usually presided over raucous sessions and was seen at times as giving rulings lenient to the government whilst being combative to the opposition. However, his vast experience of Parliament quickly established him as an assertive Speaker. As of , he is the only member of his party to have served as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

As a result of his election as Speaker, Sinclair wanted to remain in Parliament, in order to stay on as Speaker if the Howard government were to be re-elected. However, Stuart St. Clair had already been preselected as National candidate in New England. Ultimately, Sinclair was unable to reverse his retirement, and St. Clair refused to stand aside for him. St. Clair ultimately succeeded Sinclair at the 1998 election. At the time of his retirement, he was the last parliamentary survivor of the Menzies, Holt and Gorton governments.

==After politics==
In January 2001, Sinclair was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). As of 2009, Sinclair was the President of AUSTCARE, an international, non-profit, independent aid organisation. On 1 March 2000, Sinclair became the inaugural chairman of the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal (FRRR), a non-profit organisation which issues grants to regional communities. He retired on 30 June 2019 and was succeeded by Tim Fairfax. Sinclair also served for several years as the Honorary President of the Scout Association of Australia, New South Wales Branch, retiring in 2019. He received Scouts&#x27; National Presidents Award on World Scout Day 2020.

<text>Maurice Nawalagmba Yaméogo (31 December 1921 – 15 September 1993) was the first President of the Republic of Upper Volta, now called Burkina Faso, from 1960 until 1966.

&quot;Monsieur Maurice&quot; embodied the Voltaic state at the moment of independence. However, his political ascension did not occur without difficulties. As a member of the colonial administration from 1946, Maurice Yaméogo found a place for himself in the busy political landscape of Upper Volta thanks to his skill as a speaker. In May 1957, during the formation of the first Upper Voltaic government instituted under the Loi Cadre Defferre, he joined the coalition government formed by Ouezzin Coulibaly, as minister for agriculture and a member of the Voltaic Democratic Movement (MDV). In January 1958, threatened by a vote of censure, Coulibaly enticed Maurice Yaméogo and his allies in the assembly to join the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Assembly (UDV-RDA) in exchange for promises of promotion within the government. Maurice Yaméogo rose to be his second in command, with the portfolio of the Interior, a position which allowed him to assume the role of interim head of government, following Coulibay&#x27;s death in September 1958.

His rather shaky political ascendancy was reinforced by circumstances. After the proclamation of the Republic of Upper Volta on 11 December 1958, he made a surprising volte-face with respect to the Mali Federation advocated by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The Voltaic assembly supported Upper Volta&#x27;s membership in the Federation, but Yaméogo opted for political sovereignty and limited economic integration with the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente. Then, by means of controversial manoeuvres, Yaméogo eliminated all parliamentary opposition. The UDV-RDA was purged of his enemies and he imposed a one party system. Upper Volta found itself under a dictatorship even before its independence on 5 August 1960.

In foreign policy, Yaméogo envied and admired the international success of his colleague Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the President of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, who defied the anti-communists by establishing an ephemeral customs union (1961–1962) with the &quot;progressivist&quot; Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah. Houphouët-Boigny nevertheless remained his closest ally and in December 1965, Yaméogo signed an agreement with him to extend dual nationality to citizens of both countries. However, this project did not reach fruition. On 3 January 1966, as a result of severe financial austerity measures, Yaméogo&#x27;s corrupt regime was overthrown by a peaceful protest organised by the unions, traditional chieftains and the clergy. In 1993, he died after having been rehabilitated by President Blaise Compaoré.

==Early life==

According to his official biography, Maurice Yaméogo was born on 31 December 1921 at Koudougou, a town 98 km west of Ouagadougou, along with his twin sister Wamanegdo. He was the son of Mossi peasants, whom he described as a &quot;heathen family, completely given to a whole mob of superstitions.&quot; They gave him the name Naoua Laguemba (also spelt Nawalagma) which means &quot;he comes to unite them.&quot;.

From a very young age, Naoua Laguemba was very interested in Christianity. This inclination resulted in a great deal of bullying from his family. It is reported that the young Yaméogo received an emergency baptism on 28 July 1929, a year before schedule, after being struck by lightning. The priest Van der Shaegue who performed the baptism gave him Maurice as a patron saint. His mother died three days later, supposedly from the shock. After these events, he adopted the name Maurice Yaméogo, intending to become a priest.

After spending a few years at school in his village, Maurice Yaméogo was admitted to the Minor Seminary of Pabré. On 5 September 1934, he left his family to pursue his studies. Pabré was one of the most prestigious institutions in the country; aside from the fact that it produced most of the country&#x27;s priests, the Minor Seminary&#x27;s students also filled the very highest ranks of public and private administration. As a result, he met many of the rising stars of Upper Volta, such as Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Joseph Ouédraogo, and Pierre Tapsoba, with whom he formed a close friendship. But his relationships strayed far from the ecclesiastical standard. Yaméogo wanted to be a priest, but he was very keen on women and parties. In 1939, he left the Minor Seminary of Pabré, without graduating.

===Professional career===
Despite failing to graduate, Yaméogo&#x27;s education allowed him to gain a public role as a shipping clerk for the French Colonial Administration. This extremely prestigious post meant success, security and prestige. In this period he increased his involvement with women. He became enamoured of a mixed-race woman, Thérèse Larbat, whose father refused to allow him to marry her because he was an African and was not &quot;civilised enough&quot; to maintain her well-being. Yaméogo was offended by this, but eventually, he resigned himself to marrying an educated woman from Koudougou, Félicité Zagré. Together they presented themselves as the &quot;evolved&quot; couple of Koudougou; Félicité was the only African in the town who dressed like a European.

In 1940, as part of the World War II war effort, Yaméogo was sent to Abidjan in lower Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, a paradise for &quot;evolved&quot; Africans. Regular parties were held there in which Yaméogo sought to increase his social standing. He sought among other things to make many friends among the &quot;evolved&quot; non-Voltaic people. In Abidjan Yaméogo was shocked by the fact that some Voltaic businessmen were illegally trafficking workers in order to supply huge plantations with workers. In Upper Volta, Maurice also worked as a clerk for the Administrative, Accounting and Finance Services (SAFC) of the French Colonial Administration. For this purpose, he was appointed in towns like Dedougou and Koudougou. Yaméogo was later appointed the head of the CFTC syndicate (French Confederation of Christian Workers) of his corporation, and vice-president of CFTC Upper-Volta.

==Early political career==
On his return to his native town after the war, he was elected to the first territorial assembly of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire as the general councillor for Koudougou on 15 December 1946. Upper Volta had ceased to exist after 1932, being divided up between Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, French Sudan and Niger. This did not please the people of Upper Volta, who elected Philippe Zinda Kaboré to the French National Assembly in November 1946 with a mandate to restore Upper Volta. Yaméogo joined Kaboré&#x27;s entourage in the hope of thereby accelerating his own rise. When Kaboré died on 24 May 1947, Yaméogo positioned himself as his spiritual heir.

On 4 September 1947, Upper Volta was restored with its 1932 borders. Subsequently, a French law of 31 March 1948 instituted the Territorial Assembly of Upper Volta. This assembly contained fifty seats, thirty-four of which were to be held by the general counsellors elected while Upper Volta was partitioned. Yaméogo was part of this group and planned to sit as part of Kaboré&#x27;s Voltaic Democratic Party (PDV), the local branch of the African Democratic Assembly (RDA). However, the PDV-RDA suffered an electoral set-back. In the partial elections between 30 May and 20 June, it secured only three of the sixteen seats up for election, losing the other thirteen to the Voltaic Union (UV). Then, on 27 June 1948, the PDV-RDA suffered a defection to the UV, led by Henri Guissou. Yaméogo too joined the UV, swearing that he would never again be a member of the RDA.

=== Grand counsellor of the AOF (1948–1952) ===
When the assembly finally met, the general counsellors elected senators to the Council of the Republic, the counsellors of the French Union and the Grand Counsellors who would sit on the Grand Council of French West Africa (AOF) in Dakar. In the discussions, Yaméogo had been left to one side. Outraged, he attempted to make his voice heard within the party, but he was judged too ambitious and his requests were not heeded. Thus he decided to appeal directly to Father Goarnisson, a European who had been chosen by the college of natives for one of the grand counsellor posts. The priest was persuaded by him to withdraw his candidacy and support Yaméogo. Thus, on 28 July 1948, Yaméogo was elected grand counsellor of French West Africa for Upper Volta.

This was a great achievement; Yaméogo was barely twenty-six years old. Portraits of him as Grand Counsellor decorated the houses of his parents and friends. At Dakar, his wife Félicité enjoyed the role of mistress of the house, hosting the governor-general Paul Béchard with pomp, organising receptions for the &quot;evolved&quot; and Yaméogo&#x27;s colleagues, who included deputy mayor Lamine Gueye, president of the Grand Council.

At Dakar, Yaméogo once more slid towards the RDA. At the legislative elections of 17 June 1951, the PDV-RDA presented a single list with the doctor Ali Barraud, while the UV was caught up in internal dissension.
Joseph Conombo organised the main party list, Union for the Defense of the Interests of Upper Volta, which received 146,861 votes out of 249,940 and thus obtained three of the four seats up for election. The left wing of the UV, led by the outgoing deputy Nazi Boni, also presented a list, The Economic and Social Action of the Interests of Upper Volta, which secured the fourth seat with 66,986 votes. Meanwhile, the two grand counsellors, Bougouraoua Ouédraogo and Maurice Yaméogo, issued an independent list, which did not meet with any success.

=== Setback (1952–1957) ===
The electoral setbacks continued in the territorial elections of 30 March 1952. Yaméogo returned to his private role as a shipping clerk on the orders of governor Albert Mouragues. The governor of Upper Volta was known for his repressive policy towards the RDA, which, despite its rupture with the French Communist Party (PCF) in October 1950, was still suspected of communist sympathies. The uncertain relationship between Yaméogo and the RDA was surely responsible for his reassignment to Djibo in the Sahel.

Less than a year later, he returned to Ouagadougou to oversee the health service. He participated in the establishment of a club of officials. Then, hoping to relaunch his political career, Yaméogo re-entered the UV thanks to the support of his old school friend from Pabré, who had become president of the General Council, Joseph Ouédraogo. On stage with the latter, he was named joint-secretary during the first congress of the territorial union of the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) in 1954, in spite of He.

In the same year, the two wings of the UV clashed. On one side, deputy Nazi Boni founded the Popular Movement for African Development (MPEA) on 27 October 1954. On the other side, the leaders of the party terminated the UV in order to create the Social Party for the Education of the African Masses (PSEMA) in December 1954. Yaméogo once again tried t set up a separate group centred around himself, but without success. His list at the legislative elections of 2 January 1956, which included his friend Pierre Tapsoba, suffered a defeat. So too did his request to the newly elected mayor of Ouagadougou, Joseph Ouédraogo, for the post of general secretary of the mayor.

===Minister of Upper Volta under the Loi Cadre Defferre (1957–1958)===

On 29 September 1956, PSEMA merged with the PVD-RDA to form the United Democratic Party (PDU). Despite his links with both of these parties, Yaméogo joined a new party in July 1956, the Voltaic Democratic Movement (MDV), founded by Gérard Kango Ouédraogo and the French captain Michel Dorange, in which he took on the role of financial controller. In the territorial elections of 30 March 1957, the MDV list led by Maurice Yaméogo at Koudougou, which included his cousin Denis Yaméogo and the Haitian-Arab Nader Attié scored a surprising victory over the PDU list led by Henri Guissou, winning all six of the seats which were up for election. This victory was certainly due to Yaméogo&#x27;s &quot;American style campaign,&quot; characterised by numerous meetings in the markets.

As a result of the elections, 70 territorial deputies were elected. The PDU held 39 of them, the MDV had 26 and the MPEA of Nazi Boni had 5. These elections, which followed the entry into force of the Loi Cadre Defferre of 1956, were intended to produce a new local government. Rather than rule alone, the leader of the PDU, Ouezzin Coulibaly chose to establish a coalition government, with seven PDU ministers and five MDV ministers. Maurice Yaméogo took the portfolio of agriculture in the first government, under Yvon Bourges, the last French Governor in Upper-Volta.

Very quickly, tensions broke out in the PDU. During investigative meetings in September 1957, the former leader of PSEMA, Joseph Conombo, repudiated the affiliation of his party to the RDA under the control of Ouezzin Coulibaly. Conombo left the coalition government with six other deputies in order to re-establish PSEMA. Coulibay on the other hand transformed the PDU into the Voltaic Democratic Union (UDV) and affiliated it with the RDA. After these events, the UDV-RDA took an absolute majority in the assembly, while an anti-Ouezzin parliamentary group formed in December 1957, consisting of PSEMA, the MPEA and the MDV. Thus, from being a member of government, Yaméogo found himself in the parliamentary opposition. On 17 December, Joseph Conombo submitted a motion to name a new parliamentary group, a motion of no confidence in the government, which passed. Coulibaly refused to resign: the Loi Cadre Defferre explicitly state that in the case of a vote of no confidence, the government &quot;could&quot; resign, not that it &quot;was removed&quot;, from office. Upper Volta faced a political crisis.

In January 1958, Coulibaly resolved the situation by poaching Maurice Yaméogo, who brought the MDV deputies from Koudougou with him (Nader Attié, Gabriel Traoré et Denis Yaméogo) and some other counsellors like Mathias Sorgho. With this new majority, the UDV-RDA established a new government on 22 January 1958. In the new cabinet of 6 February, composed solely of members of UDV-RDA, Yaméogo was promoted to the second highest ranking position in the government, with the strategi position of Minister of the Interior, while his cousin Denis took the portfolio of Labour and Social Affairs. Ouezzin Coulibaly was taken to Paris for health reasons on 28 July 1958 and Yaméogo was placed in charge in his absence. On 4 September 1958, Oezzin Coulibaly died and Maurice Yaméogo assumed the role of acting head of government.

== President of Upper Volta (1960–1966)==
=== Establishment of personal power ===
After the people of Upper Volta had approved the constitution of the French Community on 28 September 1958, and therefore reinforced their state&#x27;s autonomy, the territorial assembly met on 17 October 1958 to designate Ouezzin Coulibaly&#x27;s successor. On that day, Moro Naba Kougri made an unsuccessful attempt to install a constitutional monarchy. Kougri, who had the support of Colonel Chevreau, the commander of the French Army in Upper Volta, gathered around 3,000 of his supporters around the assembly and attempted to influence the choice of the new president of the council. Yaméogo&#x27;s quick response to this demonstration certainly played in his favour during the rescheduled vote of the assembly on the 20 October, at which he was elected as president of the council.

==== Elimination of parliamentary opposition ====
From April 1958, the opposition in the territorial assembly was united as the Voltaic Regroupment Movement (MRV), the local branch of the African Regroupment Party (PRA), the new international African opposition to the African Democratic Rally (RDA). After Moro Naba Kougri&#x27;s attempted coup, the MRV-PRA approached Yaméogo, who formed a union government consisting of seven UDV-RDA ministers and five MRV-PRA ministers on 10 December 1958. The next day, the Republic of Upper Volta was proclaimed and the Territorial Assembly assumed legislative and constituent powers. Yaméogo retained his post as president of the council and also became Minister of Information and secretary of the youth section of the UDV-RDA.

After received special powers from the assembly on 29 January 1959, Yaméogo used his new prerogatives to dissolve the assembly on 28 February. A new division of electoral districts had taken place. A majority list ballot was adopted in the two least populated districts and a proportional representation system was adopted in the two most populated districts. This manoeuvre allowed the UDV-RDA to win 64 (or 66) seats in the legislative elections of 19 April. THE MRV-PRA won only 11 (or 9) seats. Turnout was 47%.

On 25 April, the new assembly confirmed Yaméogo in his position as President of the council. He became minister of justice and minister for veterans on the same day. On 1 May, he formed a homogenous UDV-RDA government. Soon the opposition consisted of only three members, following defections in favour of the majority. The internal position of the president of the council was reinforced on the 25th and 26 August, following the expulsion of the old RDA spokesman Ali Barraud and the party&#x27;s secretary general Joseph Ouédraogo from the UDV-RDA. This was followed by a decree on 29 August, dissolving the municipal council of Ouagadougou, which was led by Joseph Ouédraogo. An administration committee led by Joseph Conombo replaced it. No one seemed able to resist the man who was now nicknamed &quot;Monsieur Maurice.&quot; Even the most intractable members of the opposition, led by Gérard Kango Ouédraogo finally rejoined the UDV-RDA in Autumn 1959, officially putting an end to the MRV. There was no longer any parliamentary opposition. On 11 December 1959, Yaméogo was elected as the first President of the Republic of Upper Volta without opposition. Extremely distrustful, Yaméogo entrusted power during his overseas absences to the only European on his staff, the administrator of colonies Michel Frejus.

==== Single party system ====

On 22 May 1959, Yaméogo received a new grant of special powers for six months. This exceptional measure allowed him to compose a legislative arsenal against the opposition. Then, on 6 October 1959, Nazi Boni established the Voltaic National Party as a local branch of the Party of the African Federation (PFA) and Yaméogo dissolved it on the grounds that the reference to the PFA was unconstitutional. Two days later, Boni tried again, establishing the Republican Liberty Party (PRL). This was banned on 6 January 1960, on the grounds that the flag of the Federation of Mali (which Yaméogo had broken away from) had been flown at Boni&#x27;s house. After protesting this decision publicly, Nazi Boni was subjected to a judicial investigation. On 22 February, it was the turn of Gérard Kango Ouédraogo, member of the UDV-RDA, who attempted to create a new Party of Peasant Action (PAP). Yaméogo vetoed this party with an official declaration. The one-party system was entrenched.

On 12 March, the President of the Republic invited Nazi Boni and Joseph Ouédraogo to a reconciliation meeting. They declined. On 28 June, an open letter criticising the government&#x27;s actions was signed by both of them, as well as Diongolo Traoré, Edouard Ouédraogo et Gabriel Ouédraogo, in the hope of organising a roundtable discussion. In response, Yaméogo had them arrested on 2 July and imprisoned at Gorom-Gorom, except for Nazi Boni who once more went into exile. When the country became independent on 5 August 1960, all forms of opposition had been silenced.

The dictatorship was affirmed by the proclamation of 30 November of a new constitution which conferred extended powers on Yaméogo. This constitution had been adopted by the National Assembly on 6 November and approved by the people in a referendum on 27 November. As dictator, Yaméogo remained easy-going. Attempting to spare his main opponents, he used diplomatic means to remove some of them, like Gérard Kango Ouédraogo, whom he appointed ambassador to Great Britain, or Henri Guissou, whom he dispatched to Paris. The few political prisoners were released in exchange for a simple declaration of support for the regime. Joseph Ouédraogo requested to rejoin the party in February 1962 at the second UDV-RDA party congress. In the course of this congress, Yaméogo was removed as president of the party and instead appointed secretary general, a role which he held as leader of the movement.

====Paranoia, ministerial instability and corruption====
Yaméogo became more paranoid after the 13 January 1963 coup in neighboring Togo resulted in the death of President Sylvanus Olympio. Two days after the coup, Joseph Ouédraogo was arrested again along with the union leader Pierre-Claver Tiendrébéogo, party official Ali Soré, and Ambassador to the UN Frédéric Guirm. A Security Court was established, with the accused appearing there without the right to be defended by attorneys. A police inquiry refuted the existence of a plot against Yaméogo. His cousin, interior minister Denis Yaméogo, was arrested for providing him with false statements. After an imprisonment, Denis Yaméogo was reinstated to his duties in 1965. The investigation, according to Guirma, proved that the informants were men of Maxime Ouédraogo, Minister of Public Service and Labour. In June 1963, Maxime Ouédraogo was removed from office and arrested. This demonstrated one of the characteristics of Yaméogo regime: ministerial instability. Each year many hasty ministerial changes were made. Depending on his moods, the President of the Republic announced on the radio, without prior consultation, appointment or removal of ministers.

Maxime Ouédraogo was officially imprisoned for theft and misappropriation of the funds of the Central Cooperative of Upper Volta (CCCHV). Embezzlement was a common practice in the nation&#x27;s government. Maurice Yaméogo was well known for this. His wife Félicité spared no expense in fur coats and valuable cosmetics while her children bought sports cars. Meanwhile, the president spent more than half a year abroad in sumptuous villas and thermal spas. Nonetheless, the President&#x27;s way of life did not improve his mood. Beginning in 1964, he became obsessed about the establishment of a single union subservient to a single institutional party. Already, at the Congress of the UDV-RDA in 1962, he invited the legislators of the country to achieve unity within the National Union of workers of Upper Volta (UNST-HV). Since this did not happen, the National Assembly voted on 27 April 1964 to pass a law requiring unions to join the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), under penalty of immediate dissolution. In its charter OATUU allowed only one union per country: for Upper Volta this was the UNST-HV. All unions which refused to join the UNST-HV, were labeled &quot;illegal&quot; and suffered state repression.

Maurice Yaméogo became the subject of a cult of personality as evidenced by stamps printed with his image. He was the sole leader of the Republic of Upper Volta and was the only candidate for the presidential election on 3 October 1965. He was &quot;triumphantly&quot; reelected with 99.97% of votes. During the parliamentary elections of 7 November, where the participation rate was 41%, the single list of candidates he imposed won 99.89% of votes. On 5 December, Yaméogo loyalists were also victorious in the municipal elections, as the UDV-RDA swept all positions.

===Foreign affairs===

==== Reversal on the Mali Federation (1958–1959) ====

After his election as President of the council on 20 October 1958, Maurice Yaméogo faced the question of whether or not to integrate Upper Volta into the Mali Federation. He showed some hesitation on this issue, although the Voltaic political elite seemed to be generally favourable. On 12 January 1959, his lack of enthusiasm changed dramatically. By chance, one of the members of the Voltaic delegation to the federal assembly in Dakar for the 14th to 17 January died and Yaméogo replaced him. In Dakar, very skillfully, he had himself elected vice-president of the Federal Assembly.

On 28 January, in his role as head of government, he demanded that the Voltaic Assembly ratify the federal constitution. Although the 59 deputies present approved this unanimously, there was fear of a new coup attempt by Moro Naba Kougri with the anti-federalist deputy Michel Dorange. Taking advantage of this threat, Yaméogo successfully obtained the extension of his emergency powers.

According to the then high commissioner Paul Masson, Yaméogo had changed his mind about the Federation in the course of these events and sought Masson&#x27;s assistance in legally extracting Upper Volta from its engagements. On his advice, the Voltaic civil service and French jurists elaborated a new constitution which he had 40 hastily reconvened deputies ratify on 28 February, threatening to use his emergency powers to dissolve the Assembly if they refused. Afraid that they would not be re-elected, the deputies did as they were told. At the end of the meeting, Yaméogo dissolved the Assembly anyway. To justify his actions, Yaméogo organised a referendum on the constitution on 15 March, which passed with 69% of the votes. Completing this volte-face, Yaméogo co-founded an organisation hostile to the Mali Federation, the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente, on 29 May 1959, with Félix Houphouët-Boigny of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Hamani Diori of Niger, and Hubert Maga of Dahomey. The deputies elected in April acknowledged and ratified Upper Volta&#x27;s membership of this organisation on 27 June.

==== Collapse of relations with Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and France (1960-1961) ====
Within the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente, a quarrel about &quot;leadership&quot; developed between Yaméogo and Félix Houphouët-Boigny. Initially the dispute was simply about the division of customs revenues, which Yaméogo considered unfair. However, Yaméogo&#x27;s pride rapidly became the true reason for the tensions. Yaméogo held the presidency of the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente from 1960 to 1961, but Houphouët-Boigny, who was favoured by Paris, continued to direct the Entente&#x27;s discussions and negotiations on his own and to get all the kudos. On 12 February 1961, Yaméogo unexpectedly announced his refusal to sign the defence agreements which Houphouët-Boigny had negotiated with France on behalf of the four members of the Entente. This decision led to a deterioration of relations between Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Upper Volta. Relations between Upper Volta and France were also harmed by this and deteriorated further after Yaméogo expelled the French High Commissioner Paul Masson on false charges of conspiracy.

For the Burkinabe historian Yacouba Zerbo, the causes of Yaméogo&#x27;s refusal lie in a desire for independence, combined with his lack of confidence in the French troops; on 17 October 1958, the French colonel Chevrau had given his support to Moro Naba Kougri. On 24 April 1961, Yaméogo signed an accord about technical military assistance with France alone. Subsequently, he demanded the surrender of the French base at Bobo-Dioulasso by 31 December 1961, in favour of the Voltaic Armed Forces (FAV) which had been created on 1 November.

==== Rapprochement with the Casablanca Group (1961–1962) ====

Maurice Yaméogo was a fervent anti-communist. In December 1960, he co-founded the Brazzaville group with the &quot;moderate&quot; leaders of Francophone Africa, which combined with Anglophone leaders in May 1961 as the Monrovia Group. The Brazzaville and Monrovia Groups were strongly opposed to the &quot;progressivist&quot; Casablanca Group. In March 1961, the Brazzaville Group created the African and Malagasy Union (UAM), a resolutely anti-communist organisation which included a defense pact. On 9 September 1961, Yaméogo succeeded in having Ouagadougou designated as the seat of the UAM&#x27;s defense council and in having the Voltaic Albert Balima appointed secretary general. In June 1961, Yaméogo was the first African head of state to visit Israel, with which he signed a treaty of friendship and alliance.

This did not mean an open break with the members of the Casablanca Group. Perhaps he saw this as a means of attracting American aid to his country. In any case, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea was received at the capital in May 1961, and Modibo Keïta of Mali in March 1962. Relations with Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana were a top goal; Yaméogo went to Accra in May 1961 and hosted Nkrumah on 16 June. In the resulting Tamalé accords, Upper Volta and Ghana agreed to a customs union similar to that which had been made with Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Yaméogo enthusiastically called for a shared constitution for the two countries and declared &quot;Long live the future United States of Africa!&quot; Analysing the situation, the American ambassador to Upper Volta concluded that &quot;Yaméogo is fairly pro-American, but he wants to be independent of France, which is to say that he needs American economic assistance.&quot; He thought in particular that Yaméogo was attempting to end the French economic monopoly; French goods cost several times the price of the Japanese goods which could be imported through Ghana. The friendship between Yaméogo and Nkrumah was short lived. Yaméogo made up with Félix Houphouët-Boigny and the border controls with Ghana were re-established on 31 July 1962. In July 1963, following a territorial dispute, Yaméogo denounced the &quot;blatant expansionism&quot; of Ghana. A little later, relations with Mali deteriorated over the question of the border to the north of Gorom-Gorom.

==== Return to the Ivoirien orbit (1962–1966) ====
On returning to the Ivoirien orbit, Yaméogo became a zealous supporter of Félix Houphouët-Boigny. In June 1965, after Sékou Touré of Guinea had called Houphouët-Boigny a supporter of French imperialism hostile to African unity, Yaméogo appeared live on radio for close to an hour attacking the Guinean leader. He declared:
A warming of relations with France came to fruition in 1964, with the signing of two military agreements, the second of which, signed on 24 October, granted France &quot;the triple right of flight over, encampment in, and transit through, Voltaic territory.&quot;.
The following year in March and April, Yaméogo was the first African head of state invited to the White House by President Lyndon Johnson. This honour, a complete surprise, was partially due to the fact that Yaméogo had a farm and so it was supposed that he would appreciate being hosted by Johnson on his ranch. Taking advantage of the situation, Presidents Félix Houphouët-Boigny and Hamani Diori asked Yaméogo to submit a request for American financial aid to the president on their behalf. Yaméogo returned from the United States with three billion CFA Francs to be split equally between himself, Houphouët-Boigny and Diori. On Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s advice he placed his billion in a private Swiss bank account. He used these funds to finance the legislative election campaign of 7 November 1965. During his trip, Houphouët-Boigny had also entrusted him with another task. Taking advantage of the fact the Yaméogo was the only member of the Entente without a full defensive treaty with the French, he instructed Yaméogo to request a military treaty with the United States which would cover Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Niger as well as Upper Volta in the event of a Chinese invasion, a threat which France was seeking to ignore.

Yaméogo and Houphouët-Boigny also worked on a project of double nationality between Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. However, when Yaméogo left the presidency on January 3, 1966, Houphouët-Boigny abandoned this project of double nationality.

On October 17, 1965, Yaméogo married Suzanne de Monaco, a young Ivorian woman. Félix Houphouët-Boigny (President of Ivory Coast) and Hamani Diori (President of Niger) were the witnesses at his marriage. However, this union did not last long and Maurice married a third time with Jeannette. Yaméogo had many children.

=== Internal affairs under Yaméogo ===

==== Degradation of the social climate ====

With a strong Christian outlook, Yaméogo&#x27;s dictatorial regime initially enjoyed the support of the Voltaic Catholic church. In 1964, subsidies were removed for private schools (almost all of which were Catholic schools). The clergy, whose finances were thereby threatened, became more critical. The rupture became definitive in 1965. In that year, Yaméogo imprisoned his wife Félicité, divorced her and married his mistress &quot;Miss Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot; Nathalie Monaco on 17 October in a sumptuous ceremony, at which President Félix Houphouët-Boigny of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Hamani Diori of Niger served as groomsmen. The happy couple honeymooned in the Caribbean and Brazil. At the instruction of the head of the Voltaic church, cardinal Paul Zoungrana, the church invested all its moral authority in discrediting Yaméogo. The religious climate declined still further when Yaméogo returned from his honeymoon and clumsily attacked charlatans and marabouts by radio, provoking the indignation of Muslims.

Throughout his presidency, Yaméogo took measures against traditional chieftainship – undoubtedly motivated by republican ideals. In January 1962, a decree forbade the display of all insignia recalling the customary chieftainships of the colonial period. On 28 July 1964, a decree stated that should any village chieftainship fall vacant, it should be replaced by an election in which all inhabitants of the village on the electoral roll would be allowed to participate. On 11 January 1965, a new decree ended government subsidies for chiefs. These decisions were very well received in the west of the country where chiefs had not existed until introduced by the French. In the east on the other hand, they provoked anger against Yaméogo.

In turn, Yaméogo lost the support of the traditional elite, the unions, and the clergy. His excessive spending, such as the construction of a Party Palace, did not help a situation which grew more dire in March and April 1965, when a measles epidemic struck the country as a result of a vaccine shortage. In October, the shortage of classrooms and teachers made the beginning of the school year particularly difficult. Many students had to be refused education, although the enrolment rate was only 8%. In December 1965, Yaméogo&#x27;s project with Houphouët-Boigny to grant dual nationality to all citizens of Upper Volta and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire brought an end to his popularity. For most inhabitants of Upper Volta, this project implied a return to exploitation by Ivoiriens.

==== Economic weakness ====
At independence, Upper Volta&#x27;s economy was amongst the weakest in the world. The annual GDP was around 40 billion CFA francs, almost entirely derived from subsistence activities. 94% of the country&#x27;s 3,600,000 inhabitants worked in agriculture, of which 85% focussed on the cultivation of food. The tiny industrial sector employed around 4,000 people in some forty factories focussed on food processing. There were only two power stations at this time, one in Ouagadougou and the other at Bobo-Dioulasso, with a maximum power of 3.5 megawatts and 3,000 customers. Upper Volta has a total of 509 km of railway and 15,000 km of roads (only tar-sealed in a few urban centres).

Despite efforts undertaken by the French authorities after 1954, Voltaic agriculture remained unproductive. The planned establishment of a mentoring system and construction of hydro-electric dams between 1958 and 1962, co-financed by the French Aid and Cooperation Funds (FAC) and the Republic of Upper Volta, fell disappointingly short of its goals. Undiscouraged, the state encouraged the establishment of co-operatives and credit unions, and established a five-year plan for the period 1963 to 1967. This ambitious plan predicted a sustained increase in agricultural production of 4.7% per year. However, the cost of the plan, estimated at 1.5 billion CFA francs, prevented its implementation. Yaméogo turned to Franco-Voltaic co-operation agreements to obtain aid from French companies for rural development. These companies introduced new agricultural techniques for the cultivation of foodstuffs. Improvement in nutrition was observed in areas of dietary deficit. These efforts, along with a guaranteed, pre-announced price for agriculture, led to an increase in the production of cotton from 8,000 tonnes in 1963 to 20,000 tonnes in 1967.

Cotton had a growing role in Upper Volta&#x27;s exports, which reached 3.68 billion CFA francs in 1965. Two-thirds of their value derived from livestock. Despite being fairly mineral poor, the country exported 687 million CFA francs of unrefined gold between 1961 and 1963. It is notable that Upper Volta was the only country in Africa whose main export partners were other African states. Its main export partner was Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, although Ghana took the role in 1963 with 40.5% of Upper Volta&#x27;s exports, before being relegated to second place in 1965 with 17.6%. France, the third most important export partner of Upper Volta, was the source of 52% of the 9.169 billion CFA francs worth of imported products in 1965. In 1965 the balance of trade was very negative, with a deficit of 5.489 billion CFA francs.

===== Austerity plans =====

Throughout his presidency, Yaméogo sought every opportunity to obtain extra resources, much of which he was granted free of charge. Through subsidies, the French treasury gifted him 1.7 billion CFA francs. Ghana advanced him a customs rebate of 1.1177 billion in 1961. The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) granted him 600 million in budgetary support. But all this was insufficient to meet the state&#x27;s budgetary shortfall, which increased after the departure of French troops in 1961. Yaméogo met this with loans and the treasury&#x27;s cash reserves. At the end of 1965, after five years of independence, Upper Volta&#x27;s budget deficit exceeded 4.5 billion CFA francs.

Therefore, in 1964, austerity measures were introduced. An allowance has been made on special duty allowances, foreign embassies were reduced, and the representational allowance of the president was reduced from 18 to 9 million CFA francs. The resulting savings came to 250 million CFA francs. For the 1965 budget, Yaméogo decided to take more draconian measures. Payments to chiefs and subsidies for private schools were cancelled. Monthly family allowances were reduced from 2,500 to 1,500 CFA francs per child and limited to families with less than six children. These unpopular measures allowed him to reduce the budget deficit by 4.5%. Encouraged by these results, Yaméogo appointed a young, French-educated technocrat, Raphaël Medah, in charge of finance on 8 December 1965. He intended to:
* increase the budgetary revenue by levying a 10% flat tax on income (IFR) and suppressing the preferential tariff on Ivoirien imports.
* reduce state expenditures, by suppressing all the chiefs of cabinet, blocking all pay increases for two years, and limiting government cars to ministers alone.
* reduce the budget deficit by cutting the pensions of old veterans by 16% and lowering family grants from 1,500 ti 750 CFA francs.
But the true measure was the reduction by 20% of all the salaries of civil servants with the fall by 10% of scheduled taxes. This financial austerity plan was, ultimately the cause of the regime&#x27;s downfall.

=== Fall from power ===

==== Popular uprising on 3 January 1966 ====

Although autonomous unions had officially been resolved in May 1964, they reformed in December 1965 as an inter-union front led by Joseph Ouédraogo, in order to denounce Yaméogo&#x27;s austerity plans. Yaméogo was then in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to discuss the dual nationality agreement. As the situation escalated, the director of the cabinet, Adama André Compaoré called Yaméogo to inform him. He did not recognise the seriousness of the situation and assumed that there was no reason to worry. On 31 December, the unionists organised a meeting at the labour council, where they called for a general strike on 3 January 1966. This gathering had been forbidden by the minister of the interior, Denis Yaméogo, and was dispersed by the police forces. Maurice Yaméogo returned to Upper Volta on the same day and celebrated New Year&#x27;s Eve without concern for the mounting troubles.

On 1 January 1966, Yaméogo finally decided to proclaim a state of emergency: all protests were forbidden and the strikes were declared illegal. In order to discredit the inter-union front&#x27;s actions, Joseph Ouédraogo was accused of espionage on behalf of the communists. Officials were threatened with collective dismissal if they participated in the movement. Finally, he demanded that religious authorities intervene to calm the situation. They refused since they were not on good terms with Yaméogo. Along with the traditional elite, they gave their support to the movement.

Even so, the 1st and 2 January were relatively calm. It was only on the night of the 2nd that events began to come to a head. Yaméogo failed in his efforts to arrest the leaders of the inter-union front at the labour council. He ordered several armoured cars to be stationed around the palace and garrisoned the key public buildings, particularly the radio stations. The protest began in the morning of 3 January. It seems to have been Jacqueline Ki-Zerbo, the wife of Joseph Ki-Zerbo, who opened the protests with her schoolgirls. Carrying signs calling for &quot;Bread, water, and democracy,&quot; they were soon joined by the students of the Philippe Zinda Kaboré high school. These students were soon joined by more than 100,000 people of Ouagadougou, including numerous officials calling for the cancellation of the 20% cut to their salaries. The protest was not violent. Allegedly, the police themselves took part in the protests. Late in the afternoon, Yaméogo made it known to the protesters by means of his chief of staff, lieutenant-colonel Sangoulé Lamizana, that he would cancel the 20% cut and retain the existing rate of subsidies. But the situation had moved beyond the demands of Joseph Ouédraogo&#x27;s unionists and the crowd, led by the historian Joseph Ki-Zerbo called for the resignation of the President, who was cut off in camp Guillaume Ouédraogo. Finally, to resolve the situation, the leading protesters appealed to the army to take power.

==== Resignation ====
After several hours of negotiations, Maurice Yaméogo went on the radio at 4 pm and announced his decision to hand power over to lieutenant-colonel Sangoulé Lamizana:
The Army was in control; the Constitution was suspended, the National Assembly was dissolved, and Lt. Col. Sangoulé Lamizana was placed at the head of a government essentially run by senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years, and on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new Constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After a conflict arising over the 1970 Constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected through open elections in 1978.

There are two different accounts of Yaméogo&#x27;s decision to resign. According to Frédéric Guirma who interviewed Sangoulé Lamizana in 1967, Maurice Yaméogo had ordered the chief of the FAV to restore order by firing on the crowd. Lamizana&#x27;s reported to have replied that before an army would ever fire on its people, the order must be made in writing. Yaméogo refused to do this and continued to insist that the chief do as instructed. Lamizana then consulted with his officers, the majority of which were opposed. Yaméogo then decided to announce a &quot;transfer of competences&quot; in ambiguous terms, intending to resume control once the crisis was over. But as a result of popular pressure, he had to resign himself to signing his full resignation.

Yaméogo told the historian Ibrahim Baba Kaké that he had resigned in order to prevent any bloodshed. On the radio broadcast of Alain Foka&#x27;s &quot;Archives d’Afrique&quot;, dedicated to Maurice Yaméogo, Sangoulé Lamizana declared that he had never received an order to fire on the protesters, supporting Yaméogo&#x27;s account of events. Lamizana, in tears, had reluctantly agreed to take power.

==After the presidency==

=== Imprisonment and disenfranchisement (1966–1970)===

Against the advice of the unionists, Lamizana had the deposed president escorted to Koudougou. A little later, his supporters decided to enter the capital in order to contest the decision. A military force was immediately sent out to maintain order. Finally, to prevent any further incidents, the government placed Yaméogo under house arrest in Ouagadougou on 6 January. Yaméogo took this detention very badly, to the point of attempting to take his own life in December 1966. His friend Félix Houphouët-Boigny was moved by this and put active pressure on the French government to demand Yaméogo&#x27;s release. On 28 April 1967, Yaméogo was brought before a special tribunal charged with investigating his years in power. On 5 August 1967, his son Hermann Yaméogo attempted to launch a coup d&#x27;état to free him, which failed.

After these events, Charles de Gaulle boycotted Sangoulé Lamizana in order to obtain Yaméogo&#x27;s release. He received a promise. But time passed and in January 1968, Yaméogo made a second attempt at suicide by drinking a strong dose of Nivaquine. Finally, on 8 May 1969, Yaméogo was condemned in a closed court to five years of forced labour and banishment for life with the loss of all civil rights. A few days after this verdict, Lamizana issued a presidential pardon and on 5 August 1970, Yaméogo was set free.

In the course of these events, Yaméogo&#x27;s property had been seized. This included the palace which he had built in his hometown of Koudougou in 1964, officially as a result of the alleged seizure of his villa in the French Riviera and thanks to a French private bank loan. The palace had cost 59 million CFA francs. After his fall, Yaméogo&#x27;s wife Nathalie Monaco had left him. he remarried for a third time to Jeannette Ezona Kansolé.

=== Final success, imprisonment and rehabilitation (1970–1993) ===
Maurice Yaméogo continued to participate in the political life of his country using his son Hermann Yaméogo as an intermediary. In 1977 he created the National Union for the Defense of Democracy (UNDD), based on nostalgia for the first republic. In the legislative elections of 1977, the UNDD became the second-largest political party in the country after the UDV-RDA. In the presidential elections of 1978, the party fielded the banker Macaire Ouédraogo as their candidate, since Maurice Yaméogo was barred from running due to his disenfranchisement and Hermann Yaméogo was too young to run. Ouédraogo was defeated by Lamizana in the second round on 28 May 1978.

In 1980, Upper Volta suffered several coups d&#x27;état. In May 1983, Maurice Yaméogo organised a protest in favour of president Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo. On 4 August 1983, Ouédraogo was overthrown by the National Council of the Revolution (CNR) commanded by Thomas Sankara. The country was renamed Burkina Faso. On 9 November 1983, Yaméogo was brought to the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente by Sankara&#x27;s men in order to be shot. He survived thanks to Blaise Compaoré who proposed his imprisonment at the Pô military camp. On the first anniversary of Sankara&#x27;s revolution in 1984, Maurice Yaméogo was set free. On this occasion, he declared his allegiance to Thomas Sankara on radio.

After some time in Koudougou, Yaméogo settled in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in spring 1987. He enjoyed a role as an intermediary between the government of Burkina Faso and president Félix Houphouët-Boigny. In May 1991, Blaise Compaoré, now president of Burkina Faso, ordered his rehabilitation. This decision followed a letter written to him by Yaméogo in 1987 seeking the final settlement of the confiscation of his property. Yaméogo recovered his civil rights and his property. In September 1993, Yaméogo became very sick and was taken to Paris to receive treatment. Because of the seriousness of his condition, he decided to return to Koudougou in order to live out his last days. He died on 15 September on the flight home. His funeral on 17 September was attended by many of the region&#x27;s political personalities, including Alassane Ouattara (Prime Minister of Ivory Coast) and Laurent Dona Fologo (Secretary general of PDCI-RDA).

<text>The Lockheed F-94 Starfire is a first-generation jet powered all-weather day/night interceptor aircraft designed and produced by Lockheed Corporation. It was the first operational United States Air Force (USAF) fighter equipped with an afterburner as well as being the first jet-powered all-weather fighter to enter combat during the Korean War.

The F-94 was developed to fulfil a specification issued by the USAF in 1948, seeking a new interceptor capable of day and night operations to replace its piston-engined types in light of recent military advances made by the Soviet Union. The F-94 was derived from the successful Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star trainer; being a relatively simple conversion from an established aircraft led to USAF officials viewing it as a low risk option and opting to procure the type. Maintaining a high level of parts commonality with the preceding aircraft, the majority of the F-94&#x27;s external changes were related to the adoption of a larger nose that accommodated multiple guns, radar, and an automatic fire control system. Engine thrust was also bolstered by adding an afterburner to the Allison J33 powerplant used.

On 16 April 1949, the prototype YF-94 conducted its maiden flight. While teething problems were encountered, these were overcome relatively quickly. During May 1950, the F-94A reached operational service with Air Defense Command (ADC), its principal operator, where the type soon replaced the piston-engined North American F-82 Twin Mustang in the all-weather interceptor role. It was soon followed by the F-94B, a refined model that proved to have greater engine reliability and a more spacious cockpit; the F-94C equipped with a thinner wing, a more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J48 engine, and a new Hughes E-5 fire control system also followed. Further models, including a dedicated aerial reconnaissance variant, were proposed but ultimately not pursued.

In the interceptor role, the F-94 proved to have less endurance and greater reliance upon Ground Control Interception methods than some of its piston-engined predecessors. Beyond its use by ADC, it was also operated by the Far East Air Force, which used the type against various Soviet-supplied aircraft during the Korean War of the early 1950s. The Alaskan Air Command (AAC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) also operated the F-94. It had a relatively brief operational life, the replacement process commencing in the mid-1950s in favor of more advanced fighters such as the Northrop F-89 Scorpion and North American F-86D Sabre. The last aircraft was withdrawn from USAF service in 1958, while the ANG opted to retire its F-94s only one year later.

==Design and development==
===Background===
On 8 October 1948, the United States Air Force (USAF) issued a new general operating requirement that called for a radar-equipped interceptor to replace the aging Northrop F-61 Black Widow and North American F-82 Twin Mustang. This new interceptor was specifically designed to counter the emergence of new Soviet aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-4 bomber (reverse engineered from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress). The Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk had been developed with the intention of becoming the USAF&#x27;s first jet-powered night fighter, but its performance was subpar. Accordingly, Lockheed was approached by the service with a request to design a jet night fighter on a crash program basis.

The resulting aircraft was derived from the TF-80C (later designated T-33A Shooting Star) which was a two-seat trainer version of the F-80 Shooting Star. Designated F-94 Starfire, it was redesigned with a lengthened nose area to accommodate the addition of guns, radar, and an automatic fire control system. In November 1948, the P-94 was met with the approval of James Forrestal, United States Secretary of Defense. Having observed the conversion to be relatively straightforward, USAF officials chose to issue a letter contract to Lockheed during January 1949. Months later, a definitive contract for 150 production aircraft was received. By December 1949, the number on order had risen to 368 aircraft.

===Into flight===
On 16 April 1949, the first YF-94 prototype performed its maiden flight. To accelerate development, these early test aircraft were converted from existing T-33s; they maintained roughly 75% commonality in terms of components with those used in the earlier F-80 and T-33As. Flight testing determined the test aircraft to possess adequate performance. By the end of 1949, the program had been restructured to fulfil pressure from the USAF for more capable fighters; an more austere model, the F-94A, would be delivered quickest while a more capable and ambitious model, the F-94C, was produced.

The fire control system selected for the F-94 was the Hughes E-1; this unit incorporated an AN/APG-33 radar (derived from the AN/APG-3, which directed the Convair B-36 Peacemaker&#x27;s tail guns) and a Sperry A-1C computing gunsight. Due to the short range of this onboard radar system, it was useful only during the terminal phases of the interception mission; instead, the F-94 would largely be directed through traditional ground-controlled interception, akin to the preceding aircraft that it would replace.

The additional electronic equipment increased the weight of the aircraft, thus it required a more powerful engine. The Allison J33A-35 centrifugal turbojet engine, which had been installed as standard on the T-33A, was replaced with a more powerful afterburner-equipped model, the J-33-A-33. The F-94 was to be the first US production jet with an afterburner. The J33-A-33 had standard thrust of , and with water injection this was increased to and with afterburning a maximum of thrust. The combination of added weight and the use of an afterburner considerably reduced the F-94&#x27;s internal fuel capacity. The YF-94A&#x27;s afterburner suffered numerous teething problems, typically related to its igniter and the flame stabilization system.

===Production versions===
====F-94A====
The initial production model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) M3 Browning machine guns mounted in the fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role. 109 F-94As were produced. This model was only in operational service for a brief time as it was originally built and was not received well by its aircrews. The main source of complaints was its somewhat unreliable J33 engine, which frequently necessitated ground aborts and had been deemed by many crews to be unsafe. In flight, the aircraft was often judged to be unstable and difficult to maneuver when flown at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator commonly found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be able to quickly enter and exit the aircraft, which was routinely expected during alerts and scrambles. Furthermore, the clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.

====F-94B====
During January 1951, the improved F-94B entered service; it was outwardly virtually identical to the F-94A. The Allison J33 engine had received several modifications to make it considerably more reliable. The pilot was also provided with a more roomy cockpit while the canopy was replaced by a redesigned unit with a bow frame in the center between the two crew members, along with a new Instrument Landing System (ILS). 356 F-94Bs were completed. It proved to be a fairly reliable aircraft, particularly in comparison to its predecessor, and encountered relatively few problems during its service life. This improved model quickly replaced the F-94As in service with the active-duty squadrons, after which these older aircraft were temporarily returned to Lockheed to be re-engined and rebuilt to F-94B standards. These upgraded F-94A/B aircraft were also modified with a twin-gun pod under each wing for two additional 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns each, bringing the total to eight. These aircraft were then passed along to Air National Guard units where they served until the end of the 1950s.

====F-94C====
The F-94C Starfire was extensively modified from the early F-94 variants. In fact, it was initially designated F-97 before officials decided that it would be treated as a new version of the F-94 instead. At the time, USAF interest in the aircraft was allegedly lukewarm, thus Lockheed opted to fund development themselves, converting two F-94B airframes into YF-94C prototypes for evaluation. To improve performance, a completely new and much thinner wing was designed, along with a swept tail surface. The J33 engine was replaced with a more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J48, a license-built version of the afterburning Rolls-Royce Tay, which dramatically increased power over the J33, producing a dry thrust of and approximately with afterburning. The fire control system was upgraded to the new Hughes E-5 with an AN/APG-40 radar, a change which required the use of a much larger nose. All of the guns were removed and replaced with all-rocket armament consisting of four groups of six rockets in a ring around the nose. These rockets were carried in four panels that could be hinged upwards and outwards for ground reloading. In flight, these rockets were normally hidden aft of four inwards-folding doors that surrounded the nose cone. According to Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier, the F-94C was capable of supersonic flight in a steep dive with afterburner engaged.

The F-94C was the only variant to be officially named Starfire. With time, the entire F-94 family has adopted the name. The first production F-94C aircraft were delivered in July 1951, 387 examples being delivered before May 1954. The largest problem discovered in service was the nose-mounted rockets, which blinded the crew with their smoke and fire. The most severe problem associated with firing the nose-mounted rockets was that the exhaust could cause a flameout of the jet engine, which could lead to the loss of the aircraft. After the 100th aircraft, mid-wing rocket pods were added to the leading edges, similar in concept to the previous gun pods, holding 12 rockets apiece and fitted with a frangible aerodynamic nose cap which was discarded when firing the rockets. Most of the time, the nose rockets were not fitted, and the mid-wing pod rockets were the sole armament. This version of the aircraft was extensively used within the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system.

====F-94D====
An F-94D model was proposed as a single-seat fighter bomber, being armed with both bombs and rockets under the wings as well as eight nose-mounted machine guns. A single prototype was built, but the model was not ultimately accepted for production. The prototype was later used as a testbed for the 20 mm (0.79 in) M61 Vulcan cannon subsequently used on the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and many other combat aircraft.

==Operational history==

===Air Defense Command===
The primary users of the F-94 were the squadrons of Air Defense Command (ADC), eventually equipping 26 squadrons of interceptors. The first F-94As were assigned to the 325th Fighter-All Weather Group at McChord AFB and Moses Lake AFB, Washington. It replaced the propeller-driven F-82F Twin Mustangs that were in use by its 317th, 318th, and 319th squadrons. The F-82s had been pressed into interceptor service in 1949 after the Soviet Union displayed the Tupolev Tu-4 strategic bomber, a reversed-engineered version of the B-29 Superfortress, some of which had landed and were impounded in the Soviet Far East during World War II. The F-82Fs proved to be an excellent day/night all-weather interceptor, with long range, but it lacked any logistics support which resulted in a chronic shortage of parts. The jet-powered F-94As, however, had shorter legs than the F-82s and relied more on Ground Control Interception Radar (GCI) sites to vector them to intruding aircraft. 

Once the 317th was equipped in the Pacific Northwest, ADC then re-equipped its 52d Fighter-All Weather Group at McGuire AFB, New Jersey which also flew F-82Fs and provided air defense of the Northeastern United States. However, it was during this period that Air Defense Command began dispersing its Fighter-Interceptor squadrons away from their parent groups to individual bases. During 1950 and 1951, ADC sent F-94As to squadrons of the 56th Fighter Group in the upper Midwest to replace its obsolete F-47 Thunderbolts, F-51 Mustangs, as well as F-80 Shooting Star and F-86A Sabre day jet interceptors.

In March 1951, upgraded F-94Bs were received from Lockheed by the 33d Fighter Wing at Otis AFB, Massachusetts, replacing their F-86A Sabres, although the last squadron of the wing didn&#x27;t replace its Sabres until May 1952. Three Federalized Air National Guard units, the 121st FIS (DC ANG), 142nd FIS (Maine ANG), and 148th FIS (Pennsylvania ANG), received F-94Bs while they served on active duty during the Korean War call-up to defend the airspace over Washington, D.C. However, these F-94s were retained by the USAF when these ANG squadrons returned to State control in 1952. Also seven more squadrons received F-94Bs as part of the roll out from Lockheed.

Three additional squadrons (84th, 436th, and 479th FIS) received F-94Bs in 1953, although these were passed down from squadrons receiving F-94Cs. Beginning in the summer of 1951, the F-94Cs began coming off the production line, with six squadrons being equipped by May 1954. Five more squadrons were equipped in FY 54-55 which ended the production run for the interceptor by Lockheed.

===Far East Air Force===
In the Pacific, Far East Air Force (FEAF) equipped three squadrons with F-94Bs, and Air Defense Command deployed the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron to South Korea to provide a jet air-defense umbrella over the Seoul area.

The first shipment of F-94Bs arrived in Japan in March 1951, being assigned to the 339th Fighter-All Weather Squadron at Johnson Air Base. Also arriving was a mobile training unit from Chanute AFB, Illinois to provide transition training for the F-82G Twin Mustang pilots into the new jet interceptor. In May, F-94Bs began to re-equip the 68th FAWS at Itazuke Air Base, while rotating pilots and radar operators to Suwon Air Base in South Korea where they flew combat missions over North Korea with the F-82Gs as well as air defense alert over Seoul. In July, the 4th FAWS began receiving the F-94As at Naha Air Base, Okinawa. Training for the squadrons proceeded through the summer and in August, the first Fifth Air Force Operational Readiness Test was held by the 339th FAWS with the F-94. Various issues with the aircraft, as well as issues with the Ground Control Interception radar graded the test as &quot;fair&quot;.


In early December 1951, the appearance of Communist MiG-15 jets over Seoul raised alarm bells at FEAF Headquarters. The only interceptors over Seoul were about six F-82Gs along with some Marine Grumman F7F Tigercats. FEAF ordered the 68th to move two F-94Bs to Suwon to supplement the F-82s. The F-82s along with the F7Fs would continue their armed reconnaissance and weather missions against North Korean targets, while the F-94s would fly interception missions over South Korea and the Yellow Sea. Care was taken to not fly the Starfires anywhere that a crash would allow the communists access to the wreck if it were shot down.

During January 1952, ADC was ordered to deploy the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the 25th Air Division at Larson AFB, Washington to Japan, and to relieve the 68th FIS at Itazuke. A detachment of the ADC squadron was sent to Misawa AB to fly air defense missions over Northern Honshu and Hokkaido against any intruding Soviet aircraft from Sakhalin Island or the Vladivostok area. At Suwon, the 68th had a total of fifty-eight interceptions during February during nighttime hours. It was in February 1952 that the first F-94 was lost in a night interception while pursuing an unknown aircraft over the Yellow Sea. The cause of the loss was unknown. However, a B-26 pilot observed an explosion in the air between the island of Taeyonp&#x27;yong-do and the city of Haeju in North Korea. A search was made for the aircraft and crew, which continued for almost three months. It was finally concluded the aircraft had crashed and broken up over the Yellow Sea, with the wreckage settling in deep water and the classified equipment lost at sea.

In March 1952, the 319th FIS began flying operational missions at Suwon, providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) for B-29 missions at night. The 68th was relieved and reassigned to Japan, but would remain on one-hour alert for possible combat duty over Korea. In June, the first F-94 contacts against enemy jets was made and the interceptor crews believed at the time that the communists were testing radar-warning equipment. On several occasions just when they were ready to fire on the enemy aircraft, it would start evasive action that indicated the MiGs were equipped with a form of warning radar (as the F-94s were). Other intercepts would take place over North Korea and the F-94 was credited with several air-to-air victories, including the first jet-vs.-jet night victory against a MiG-15. One F-94 was listed as lost due to enemy action, six more to non-enemy causes on combat missions, two were declared as missing on a combat mission and three were lost in accidents. One F-94 was lost when it slowed to during pursuit of a Po-2 biplane.

Following the Armistice in Korea in June 1953, the F-94s continued to fly air defense missions over Japan and South Korea. Beginning in 1954, the F-86D Sabre began replacing it in operational service. By the end of 1954, the Starfires had been returned to the United States for Air National Guard duty.

===Alaskan Air Command===
Immediately after World War II ended, most of the Eleventh Air Force in Alaska was withdrawn, and its assets were concentrated at two bases, Ladd AFB near Fairbanks and Elmendorf AFB near Anchorage. With the advent of the Soviet Tu-4 and its possession of the atomic bomb, US air defense assets were deployed to Alaska to guard against a Soviet attack on the United States coming from Siberia. Chains of Ground Control Radar sites were established under Alaskan Air Command (AAC), the postwar successor to Eleventh Air Force, and P-61 Black Widows were sent in 1948 as long distance interceptor aircraft. The F-82H Twin Mustang replaced the war-weary P-61s during 1949.

These propeller-driven interceptors were augmented in 1950 when the 449th Fighter-All Weather Squadron at Ladd AFB began receiving F-94As in mid-1950s. The squadron was divided into the F-82 flight and the F-94 flight as the jet interceptors doubled the squadron in size. In Anchorage, the 57th Fighter Group at Elmendorf AFB began sending its F-80C Shooting Stars back to the Continental United States in batches of four or five as they were replaced by the F-94As. Elmendorf AFB, being located close to the Gulf of Alaska in the south had much more moderate weather than Ladd AFB, located in Central Alaska where winter temperatures often fell below . Hydraulic fluids would turn to jelly, and the engines in the jets would have starting problems. Extreme cold weather training for Air Force personnel assigned to Ladd AFB was mandatory in the event of an emergency ejection or even just being outside in the winter, losing a glove, and dropping a wrench or tool. Skin would freeze upon touching bare metal, and mechanics would have tools &quot;welded&quot; to their fingers at times.
The 449th utilized its F-82Hs as long-range reconnaissance aircraft along the Siberian coastline and the Chukchi Peninsula. Also the F-82s were flown in a ground support role during maneuvers with the Army forces. They would also drop bombs on frozen rivers to break up ice floes. For these missions, the F-94 was totally unsuitable and it also did not have the range for the long distance reconnaissance flights necessary to monitor the Siberian coast. Alaska was divided into two areas, the northern part under the 11th Air Division, headquartered at Ladd AFB, and had control of the GCI sites in the northern half of the territory. The 57th Fighter Group, based at Elmendorf AFB, was responsible for everything south. In April 1953, the 57th FIG was inactivated and the three squadrons F-94s at Elmendorf AFB became part of the 10th Air Division. Both the 449th FIS and the 57th FIG deployed the F-94s to advance airfields at Marks AFB, near Nome, along with King Salmon Airport and Galena AFB where it stood alert to respond to GCI intruder alerts for unknown aircraft detected intruding on Alaskan airspace.

The F-82Hs at Ladd were retired in the summer of 1953 when due to lack of logistics support, the aircraft became too unreliable to keep in the air. The 449th flew the F-94A until F-94Bs became available as hand-me-downs from Elmendorf AFB the 57th FIG was inactivated replaced by the 10th Air Division. There, the 10th AD received new North American F-86D Sabre interceptors. The 449th at Ladd sent their F-94As back to the CONUS and Air National Guard Service. By the end of 1954, it also was being re-equipped with F-86Ds, with the last of the Starfires also being sent to the Air National Guard.

===Northeast Air Command===
Northeast Air Command (NEAC) was a command formed in 1950 to administer US-controlled bases in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, that were under long-term lease going back to World War II. It was responsible for the defense of the northern approaches to North America and also to support transient aircraft of MATS and SAC, all of which came under the collective command and control of the 64th Air Division.
During 1952, F-94Bs were sent to the 59th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Goose AFB, Labrador from Otis AFB, Massachusetts; furthermore, a detachment of the 59th was sent to Thule Air Base, Greenland to provide air defense of the area, although it was still under construction to back up the DEW Line. Thule was a staging base at the time for the SAC B-36 Peacemaker intercontinental bomber, which would proceed from there in wartime to targets in the Soviet Union using the great circle route over the North Pole. This was both the first F-89 squadron assigned to Canada and also the first squadron assigned to NEAC.

After the end of the Korean War, the 319th FIS, which was deployed from ADC to Japan in 1952, was transferred to NEAC in June 1953 and replaced the detachment of the 59th FIS at Thule. The third and last F-94 squadron assigned to NEAC was the 61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved from Selfridge AFB, Michigan to Ernest Harmon AFB, Newfoundland in August 1953. Beginning in 1954, and continuing until 1957, the Starfires of NEAC were slowly replaced with versions of the F-89 Scorpion, although the Northrop interceptor didn&#x27;t fully replace the Starfires until the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron left Thule in April 1957.

Keflavik Airport, Iceland, although controlled by Military Air Transport Service (MATS), received F-94Bs as part of the 82d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in April 1953. It provided air defense of Iceland until being relieved in October 1954 when it was reassigned to Presque Isle AFB, Maine. The Starfires were replaced by the 57th FIS and F-89C Scorpions.

===Retirement===
Beginning in mid-1954, the F-94A/B models were gradually replaced in the active-duty Air Force&#x27;s inventory by a combination of the Northrop F-89C/D Scorpion and the North American F-86D Sabre interceptors. Withdrawn aircraft were typically sent to various Air National Guard (ANG) units where they replaced F-80C Shooting Stars and F-51D/H Mustangs, which in most cases marked the end of operational use for the venerable Mustang in United States military service. Prior to being delivered to the ANG, the F-94As were sent to Lockheed, where they received modifications to render them equivalent to F-94B standards, after which they entered use with the ANG. During the late 1950s, F-94Cs were progressively transferred across to the ANG as well, where they initially supplemented and eventually replaced the F-94A/B models. At the height of operations, a total of 22 ANG Fighter-Interceptor squadrons were equipped with Starfires.

During November 1957, the final F-94C was retired by the active-duty Air Force, the last examples being operated by the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana, before it converted to the F-89J Scorpion interceptor. The last F-94C Starfires were phased out of ANG service by the 179th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at the Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota during the summer of 1959 when it converted to the F-89J Scorpion; the last aircraft being sent to AMARC in December 1959.

<text>Timothy Zachery Mosley (born March 10, 1972), known professionally as Timbaland, is an American record producer, rapper, and singer. Born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, he has received widespread acclaim for his innovative production work and distinctive &quot;stuttering&quot; rhythmic style. In 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him—from sultry, urban-edged R&amp;B songstresses [...] to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.&quot;

Timbaland&#x27;s first major production credit was on the album &quot;Ginuwine...the Bachelor&quot; (1996) by R&amp;B singer Ginuwine. Further commercial success on his following productions—including Aaliyah&#x27;s second studio album &quot;One in a Million&quot; (1996) and Missy Elliott&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot; (1997)—made him a sought-after producer for R&amp;B and hip-hop acts. He performed as a recording artist himself while doing so, releasing three albums as part of the Virginia-based hip hop duo Timbaland &amp; Magoo, along with his debut solo album, &quot;Tim&#x27;s Bio&quot; (1998). He produced Justin Timberlake&#x27;s 2002 single &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, and thereafter produced the majority of Timberlake&#x27;s subsequent releases—including &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; (2007) and &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot; (2013)—along with their respective hit singles. 

Timbaland&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Give It To Me&quot; (featuring Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake) peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and preceded the release of his second album, &quot;Shock Value&quot; (2007). It spawned the follow-up singles &quot;The Way I Are&quot; (featuring Keri Hilson) and &quot;Apologize&quot; (with OneRepublic), which peaked at numbers three and two on the chart, respectively. His third album, &quot;Shock Value II&quot; (2009) was supported by the top 40 singles &quot;Carry Out&quot; (featuring Justin Timberlake), &quot;Say Something&quot; (featuring Drake) and &quot;If We Ever Meet Again&quot; (with Katy Perry). Meanwhile, Timbaland&#x27;s production credits throughout this time expanded to include songs for Michael Jackson, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Madonna, Kanye West, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Lil Wayne, and Björk, among others. He has won four Grammy Awards from 22 nominations. 

Timbaland founded the record labels Beat Club in 2001 and its successor, Mosley Music Group in 2006, through which he has signed artists including Nelly Furtado—whose album &quot;Loose&quot; (2006) peaked the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200—as well as OneRepublic, Keri Hilson, Bubba Sparxxx, and the late Chris Cornell. &quot;Beat Club&quot; is namesake of a service in which Timbaland mentors upcoming producers, launched in 2020. Along with fellow producer Swizz Beatz, he co-created the webcast series &quot;Verzuz&quot; that same year.

==Early life==
Timothy Zachery Mosley was born on March 10, 1972, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a homeless shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach. During his time as a DJ, he was known as &quot;DJ Tim&quot; or &quot;DJ Timmy Tim&quot;. He has a younger brother named Sebastian. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and an author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for &#x27;Surrounded By Idiots&#x27;) which also featured Neptunes producer, his cousin, Pharrell Williams. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.

==Career==
===1992–2005===
Rapper Missy Elliott heard his material after being introduced to him by Magoo &amp; she began working with him and Melvin Magoo Barcliff as well. She and her R&amp;B group, Sista, auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer and member of the successful R&amp;B act Jodeci. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based. It was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland after the Timberland boot. He and Magoo became part of Devante Swings’s label called Swing Mob. The label featured signees known as &quot;Da Bassment&quot; crew, joining artists such as R&amp;B singer Ginuwine, male vocal group Playa (Smoke E. Digglera, Static Major and Digital Black), and the girl group Sugah which members included Rolita White, Susan Weems, and Charlene Tweet Keys . Timbaland did production work on a number of projects with DeVante, including the 1995 Jodeci LP &quot;The Show, The After-Party, The Hotel&quot;, and Sista&#x27;s (unreleased) début LP &quot;4 All the Sistas Around da World&quot;. Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R&amp;B girl group 702 and MC Lyte. Due to Timbaland&#x27;s connection with her, he was often contacted to produce remixes of her songs.

Timbaland began his producing career for R&amp;B acts. In the early to mid-1990s, he produced a few songs for R&amp;B acts such as Jodeci and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah&#x27;s second album &quot;One in a Million&quot; and Ginuwine&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ginuwine...the Bachelor&quot;. This included the major hit singles &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; by Aaliyah and &quot;Pony&quot; by Ginuwine. While Timbaland was initially producing for R&amp;B artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip-hop with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R&amp;B, and in this way his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R&amp;B production. In 1997, he fully produced &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot;, the debut album of Missy Elliott, who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner Magoo, &quot;Welcome to Our World&quot;, also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas, and The LOX. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay-Z and rap group UGK with the hit &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;. He also fully produced Missy&#x27;s second album in 1999, &quot;Da Real World&quot;. During this time, Timbaland continued to produce primarily for R&amp;B artists. He continued to produce for Ginuwine and Aaliyah, as well as contributing significantly to albums by Xscape, Nicole, Playa, and Total. He remixed Usher&#x27;s major hit &quot;You Make Me Wanna&quot;. In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris&#x27; &quot;Roll Out (My Business)&quot;, Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Hola&#x27; Hovito&quot;, Petey Pablo&#x27;s &quot;Raise Up&quot;, and Beck&#x27;s cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; during this period. He also contributed three songs, all eventually released as singles, to Aaliyah’s self-titled third album, the exotic lead single &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; (featuring himself rapping a verse), &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;, and the ballad &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;. He also makes an appearance in Aaliyah&#x27;s single &quot;Try Again&quot;, which he also produced and co-wrote.

Timbaland &amp; Magoo’s second album together was slated for release in November 2000. &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; was to feature appearances by Beck, Aaliyah, as well as new Timbaland protégés—some from his new Beat Club Records imprint--Ms. Jade, Kiley Dean, Sebastian (Timbaland&#x27;s brother), Petey Pablo, and Tweet (who was a member of Sugah during the Swing Mob days). The album was delayed for an entire year, finally released in November 2001. It was a commercial disappointment. Beck’s vocals for the track &quot;I Am Music&quot; were not included on the last version, which instead featured Timbaland singing along with Steve &quot;Static&quot; Garrett of Playa and Aaliyah. The first release on Beat Club was the début album by Bubba Sparxxx in September 2001, &quot;Dark Days, Bright Nights&quot;. The loss of Aaliyah deeply affected Timbaland. In a phone call to the MTV show &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, Timbaland said: 

Timbaland contributed three tracks to Tweet&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Southern Hummingbird&quot;, and produced most of Missy Elliott&#x27;s fourth and fifth LPs, &quot;Under Construction&quot; and &quot;This Is Not a Test!&quot; He also produced tracks for artists such as Lil&#x27; Kim (&quot;The Jump Off&quot;) and southern rapper Pastor Troy during this period. Collaborating with fellow producer Scott Storch, Timbaland also worked on a number of tracks on former *NSYNC lead singer Justin Timberlake’s solo debut, &quot;Justified&quot;, including the song &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;.

Late in 2003, Timbaland delivered the second Bubba Sparxxx album, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, and the third Timbaland &amp; Magoo album, &quot;Under Construction, Part II&quot; Both albums were released to little fanfare or acclaim even though &quot;Deliverance&quot; was praised by reviews and embraced by the internet community. In 2004, Timbaland produced singles for LL Cool J, Xzibit, Fatman Scoop, and Jay-Z, and he produced the bulk of Brandy’s fourth album, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;. Timbaland co-wrote two tracks (&quot;Exodus &#x27;04&quot; and &quot;Let Me Give You My Love&quot;) and produced three tracks of the American-Japanese Pop star Hikaru Utada’s second English album, &quot;Exodus&quot;. He continued working on tracks for Tweet and for Elliott’s sixth album, &quot;The Cookbook&quot;: &quot;Joy (feat. Mike Jones)&quot;, and &quot;Partytime&quot; and continued to expand his reach with production for The Game and Jennifer Lopez (&quot;He&#x27;ll Be Back&quot; from her fourth studio album, &quot;Rebirth&quot;).

===2006–2011===
Timbaland started a new label, Mosley Music Group along with old friend and legendary Australian music producer John Servedio, also known as his stage name &#x27;ServidSounds&#x27; who helped Timbaland bring in some talent from his former Beat Club Records label. On the new label were Nelly Furtado, Keri Hilson, and rapper D.O.E. In 2006 he produced Justin Timberlake&#x27;s second solo studio album &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot;. His vocals feature on the songs &quot;SexyBack&quot;, &quot;Sexy Ladies&quot;, &quot;Chop Me Up&quot;, &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot; and on the prelude to &quot;My Love&quot; entitled &quot;Let Me Talk to You&quot;. Timbaland provided vocals on several singles: The Pussycat Dolls&#x27; &quot;Wait a Minute&quot;, Nelly Furtado&#x27;s &quot;Promiscuous&quot;, &quot;Ice Box&quot; by Omarion and Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;SexyBack&quot;. In an interview published in August 2006 in the UK Timbaland revealed he was working on a new LP by Jay-Z and that he had worked on tracks with Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin.

Timbaland worked on seven songs for Björk&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Volta&quot;, including &quot;Earth Intruders&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, and &quot;Innocence&quot; and he later worked on tracks for the new Duran Duran album, &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot;, including one featuring his frequent collaborator Justin Timberlake. Later in the year, Timbaland produced songs for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s LP, &quot;Strength &amp; Loyalty&quot; and the song &quot;Ayo Technology&quot; on 50 Cent’s album &quot;Curtis&quot;. Timbaland also produced most of the tracks on Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s third CD, &quot;Bittersweet World&quot;, including the song &quot;Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)&quot;. On April 3, 2007, Timbaland released a collaboration album featuring artists including 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Elton John, Fall Out Boy, Nelly Furtado, Missy Elliott, and others called &quot;Shock Value&quot;. A rivalry flared up between Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in early 2007. The tension initially started on the single &quot;Give It to Me&quot;, when Timbaland anonymously backlashed Storch: &quot;I&#x27;m a real producer and you[&#x27;re] just the piano man&quot;. In an interview, Timbaland confirmed that he was talking about Storch. The dispute partly stemmed from controversy regarding writing credits for Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;.

Timbaland helped produce many albums for various artists in 2008, including Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Hard Candy&quot;, Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Bittersweet World&quot;, Keri Hilson&#x27;s &quot;In a Perfect World&quot;, Flo Rida&#x27;s &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, Letoya Luckett&#x27;s &quot;Lady Love&quot;, Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s &quot;Spirit in the Dark&quot;, Chris Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot;, JoJo&#x27;s &quot;All I Want Is Everything&quot;, Nicole Scherzinger&#x27;s &quot;Her Name Is Nicole&quot;, Missy Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Block Party&quot;, Matt Pokora&#x27;s &quot;MP3&quot;, Keithian&#x27;s &quot;Dirrty Pop&quot;, The Pussycat Dolls&#x27;s &quot;Doll Domination&quot;, Busta Rhymes&#x27;s &quot;B.O.M.B&quot;, Lisa Maffia&#x27;s &quot;Miss Boss&quot;, Teairra Mari&#x27;s &quot;Pressed for Time&quot;, Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s self-titled debut album, Dima Bilan&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot;, Samantha Jade&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is Samantha Jade&quot;, New Kids on the Block&#x27;s &quot;The Block&quot;, and Keshia Chanté&#x27;s &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot;. Timbaland produced the Russian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, &quot;Believe&quot; by Dima Bilan, which was co-written by Bilan and Jim Beanz. The song then won the contest when it was held in Belgrade, Serbia in May 2008. In February 2008 the first &quot;Fashion Against AIDS&quot; collection -an initiative of Designers Against AIDS and sold in H&amp;M stores in 28 countries- was launched, for which Timbaland designed a T-shirt print, posed for the campaign and spoke out in a video, to help raise HIV/AIDS awareness among urban youth and to advocate safe sex. On February 8, 2008, it was announced that Timbaland would be releasing an album exclusively for Verizon Wireless&#x27;s V CAST cell phone service and was designated its very first &quot;Mobile Producer in Residence&quot;. Timbaland was to be joined by Mosley Music Group/Zone 4 singer and songwriter Keri Hilson to begin work on the mobile album&#x27;s first track aboard the fully equipped Mobile Recording Studio. The only track to surface so far is Garry Barry Larry Harry &quot;Get It Girl&quot;. In Timbaland&#x27;s first effort within the video game industry, he worked with Rockstar Games to produce &quot;Beaterator&quot;, a music mixing game for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Network, and iOS released in the September 2009.

Timbaland spoke to MTV&#x27;s Shaheem Reid back in July 2008 to confirm that he was working on the follow-up to his platinum selling &quot;Shock Value&quot;. At the time he confirmed that he had one track with Madonna which although recorded for her album &quot;Hard Candy&quot; it had not been used and could end up on this album instead. He was insistent that he would also collaborate with Jordin Sparks, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and T.I. However, none of these collaborations (except Miley Cyrus) made it to the final track list. He also said that alongside T-Pain who would definitely appear, he hoped to get Jay-Z on board, although he ultimately failed to do so. Timbaland began working on the sequel to &quot;Shock Value&quot; in July 2008. In March 2009, he filed a lawsuit against his label, Blackground Records, alleging that they attempted to blackball him after he decided to move from music performance into production.

In September 2009, Timbaland announced that &quot;Shock Value II&quot; will be released on November 23, in Europe and November 24, in North America. However, it was pushed back to December 8, preceded by the first single which features a new recording artist named SoShy entitled &quot;Morning After Dark&quot;. New featured guest appearances on the album include DJ Felli Fel, Justin Timberlake, JoJo, Bran&#x27;Nu, Drake, Chad Kroeger, Sebastian, Miley Cyrus, Melody Thornton, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry, Esthero, The Fray, Jet, Daughtry, OneRepublic, Keri Hilson, Attitude and D.O.E.. Ultimately Madonna, Jonas Brothers, Rihanna, Usher, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Linkin Park, The All-American Rejects, Paramore, Gucci Mane, T-Pain, T.I. and Akon never appeared on &quot;Shock Value II&quot;. &quot;Shock Value II&quot; is infamous for its use of over-the-top vocal effects.

&quot;Morning After Dark&quot; featuring SoShy and Nelly Furtado is the lead single from Timbaland&#x27;s third studio album. The song was written by Tim Mosley, Jerome Harmon, Deborah Epstein, Michelle Bell, Keri Hilson, Nelly Furtado, James Washington, John Maultsby and produced by Timbaland and Jroc. The single premiered on October 16, 2009, on Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s KIIS-FM radio show, On-Air with Ryan Seacrest with Timbaland describing it as the kick-off song from the project. Following her performance, the song was sent for radio adds on May 25. The song peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. With this success, the song became Sparks&#x27; fifth consecutive top 20 hit and third nonconsecutive top 10 hit. On May 24, Sparks headed to Europe to begin promotion for the single. &quot;Say Something&quot; featuring Canadian rapper Drake was released to US iTunes on November 3, 2009. It was officially sent to U.S. radio on January 5, 2010. It is the album&#x27;s second single and reached number 23 on the Hot 100, making it the second most successful single on the album. &quot;Carry Out&quot; featuring Justin Timberlake is the third single from the album but was initially only released in the U.S. It was sent to US radio on December 1, 2009. It is the most successful single on the album, peaking at number 11 on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&quot;. The music video premiered on February 18, 2010. It was released as the third UK single on April 26, 2010. &quot;If We Ever Meet Again&quot; featuring Katy Perry is the album&#x27;s fourth single. The music video premiered on January 18, 2010. In the UK, it was released February 15, 2010.

Timbaland produced Chris Cornell&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Scream&quot;. Shakira was asked to record vocals on the song &quot;Give It Up to Me&quot; to be included on Timbaland&#x27;s forthcoming album but it was placed on her third studio album &quot;She Wolf&quot; and released as the second US single instead. One of the songs Timbaland had produced for Beyoncé&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;I Am... Sasha Fierce&quot; was reworked by Keri Hilson and Jay-Z for &quot;Shock Value II&quot; but not included. He was a guest host of WWE&#x27;s Raw on December 28, 2009. Timbaland appeared on March 25, 2010, episode (titled &quot;Blowback&quot;) of &quot;FlashForward&quot; as an evidence agent. His songs &quot;Morning After Dark&quot; and &quot;Symphony&quot; appear on the video game &quot;Def Jam: Underground.&quot;

In April 2010, a feud arose between the producer and R&amp;B singer Ginuwine, after Timbaland failed to make an appearance at the singer&#x27;s music video shoot of &quot;Get Involved&quot;. Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled &quot;Talk That&quot;. In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold claim to be the inspiration for the dubstep music scene. &quot;The UK scene... they’re always telling me that I started it. You have Dub-bass...&quot;. When questioned further about it he went on to say: &quot;It’s funny cos they went back to some of my old music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass.&quot; In August 2010, a &quot;possible suicide attempt&quot; APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted.

In 2010, Timbaland split with longtime label Blackground Records, but stayed with Interscope Records. Later in the year, Timbaland was featured on the deluxe edition of Chris Brown&#x27;s album, &quot;F.A.M.E.&quot;, producing the songs &quot;Paper, Scissors, Rock&quot; (feat. Big Sean) and the Japan-only bonus track, &quot;Talk Ya Ear Off&quot;. Timbaland was also featured on David Guetta&#x27;s LP, &quot;Nothing But the Beat&quot;, on &quot;I Just Wanna F&quot; with Dev and Afrojack. Timbaland also worked with teen star Demi Lovato; he produced and had a small feature in her song &quot;All Night Long&quot; on Lovato&#x27;s &quot;Unbroken&quot; album. In November 2010, Timbaland announced that he would be releasing a new song every Thursday, called Timbo Thursdays; a copy of the initiative shown by artists such as Kanye West (via G.O.O.D. Fridays), and Swizz Beatz (via Monster Mondays). In an interview with Rap-Up.com Timbaland stated, &quot;So, my brother told me Kanye is puttin&#x27; out a new song every Friday called G.O.O.D. Fridays, Swizz got Mondays, I don&#x27;t know if they are on Twitter but can you hit them up, and tell them reserve that Thursday for Timbo the king baby. We’ll call it Timbo Thursday, cool?&quot;

On January 7, 2015, Timbaland received production credit for his involvement with the musical score of Lee Daniels and Danny Strong&#x27;s television project &quot;Empire&quot;, which premiered on FOX. Constructively, Timbaland and his team, including Jim Beanz, Raphael Saadiq, and others, compose the series&#x27; songs based on material given to them by the show&#x27;s writing team per each episode.

In February 2016, Timbaland and Missy Elliott teamed up to produce the track &quot;Somebody Else Will&quot; for longtime associate, Tweet, for her third studio album &quot;Charlene&quot;.

In August 2021, Blackground rebranded as Blackground 2.0, with Barry Hankerson remaining as founder. Blackground 2.0 signed a distribution deal with Empire Distribution, which will re-release the label&#x27;s catalogue on CD, cassette and vinyl, onto digital download sites and, for the first time ever, streaming services. Aaliyah&#x27;s catalogue began its re-release in chronological order, starting with &quot;One In a Million&quot; on August 20, 2021. Timbaland&#x27;s 1998 LP &quot;Tim&#x27;s Bio: Life from da Bassment&quot; and Timbaland &amp; Magoo albums &quot;Welcome to Our World&quot;, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; and &quot;Under Construction, Part II&quot; were re-released August 27, 2021.

The song was originally recorded in 2012 and a video (which also resurfaced) was shot for it that featured a cameo from Timbaland. Smith had intended &quot;Karma&#x27;s a Bitch&quot; to be her first single but her label decided to go with another song she worked on with Timbaland called &quot;Provocative.&quot; Smith&#x27;s version was widely praised with fans also praising Timbaland&#x27;s production on Smith&#x27;s original version. On 14 April 2024, Smith released her version independently days after it went viral on Tik Tok. On November 22, 2024, he released the single &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t Up To Me&quot;, alongside Zefaan.

==Legacy==

An important figure in the creation of American R&amp;B&#x27;s &quot;stuttering kick-drums template&quot;, Timbaland&#x27;s influence extended beyond the U.S. and crossed international borders, especially in UK garage and rave culture. Timbaland, as an R&amp;B producer, created a distinctive, rhythmic sound using breakbeats, which break up the smooth flow of tracks to create moments of tension and release. This technique that Timbaland pioneered would later serve to create &quot;bootleg&quot; garage tracks, which was essential in the rise of UK garage. What began as an underground movement soon grew in popularity, with bootleg remixes selling upwards of 20,000 copies, something unheard of at the time. One such example is the remix of Brandy &amp; Monica&#x27;s &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;. Timbaland is credited along with other Virginia artist such as The Clipse, Pharrell Williams and Missy Elliot with establishing Virginia as one of the East Coast’s strongholds in Hip Hop.

==Plagiarism accusations==
Aaliyah&#x27;s 2001 self-titled album, produced by Timbaland, contained an uncredited sample of &quot;Alouli Ansa&quot; by Mayada El-Hennawy in &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;.

In January 2007, Timbaland was alleged to have plagiarized several elements (both motifs and samples) in the song &quot;Do It&quot; on the 2006 album &quot;Loose&quot; by Nelly Furtado without giving credit or compensation. The song itself was released as the fifth North American single from &quot;Loose&quot; in July 2007.

Timbaland&#x27;s legal troubles continued. In lieu of a copyright lawsuit over the song &quot;Throw It on Me&quot; from his &quot;Shock Value&quot; album, Timbaland and David Cortopassi, the composer of &quot;Spazz&quot;, a song originally recorded by The Elastik Band and released by ATCO/Atlantic and EMI, reached a settlement agreement in July 2009. The terms of the settlement remained undisclosed at the time. &quot;Spazz&quot;, noted as being &quot;one of the most tasteless records ever made&quot;, was initially banned by radio stations and even pulled mid-stream while on air when first released in 1967, with the DJ even apologizing to his listeners for playing the record.

In January 2014, the Swiss newspaper &quot;Basler Zeitung&quot; revealed another plagiarism case concerning the track &quot;Versus&quot; by Jay-Z, which was produced by Timbaland. The track&#x27;s instrumental is very similar to, if not directly sampled from &quot;On the Way&quot; by Swiss musician Bruno Spoerri. According to Swiss newspaper &quot;Tages-Anzeiger&quot;, the plagiarism case was settled by March 2015. Jay-Z and Timbaland were to pay 50% from the song&#x27;s revenue to Spoerri as royalties for the music, with Jay-Z retaining 50% for the lyrics.

<text>Henry Dunster (November 26, 1609 (baptized) – February 27, 1658/59) was an Anglo-American Puritan clergyman and the second president of Harvard College. Brackney says Dunster was &quot;an important precursor&quot; of the Baptist denomination in America, especially regarding infant baptism, soul freedom, religious liberty, congregational governance, and a radical biblicism.

==Life==

He was born at Bolholt near Bury, Lancashire, England to Henry Dunster.
Dunster studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge as a sizar, specializing in oriental languages and earning a reputation as a Hebrew scholar. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree (1630) and his M.A. (1634). He served as headmaster of Bury Grammar School and was a curate at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Bury.

Sponsored by Rev. Richard Mather, Dunster immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1640. Nathaniel Eaton was fired in 1639 as master of the recently established Harvard College, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Dunster was appointed as his successor. On August 27, 1640 Dunster became the first president of Harvard. At Dunster&#x27;s alma mater, Magdalene College, the presiding officer was called the &quot;master&quot; and his second the &quot;president&quot;. Some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility, considering himself only a temporary place-holder. 

Dunster modeled Harvard&#x27;s educational system on that of England, including Eton College and the University of Cambridge. He set up as well as taught Harvard&#x27;s entire curriculum alone for many years, graduating the first college class in America, the Class of 1642. From 1649-1650 Dunster also served as interim pastor at the First Parish in Cambridge until the accession of Jonathan Mitchel. 

Historians have generally treated Dunster well in terms of his theological beliefs and educational abilities. Samuel Eliot Morison, the best-known historian of Harvard&#x27;s history, wrote that Harvard College &quot;might have followed her first patron to an early death and oblivion but for the faith, courage and intelligence of Henry Dunster.&quot; Dunster held Harvard together financially during a difficult economic downturn in New England that began soon after his arrival. He later had some conflict with the college&#x27;s treasurer, Thomas Danforth, who called him the &quot;de facto treasurer.&quot; However, Dunster indeed the &quot;de facto treasurer&quot; of Harvard for nearly a decade. With the approval of the General Court of Massachusetts Bay, he later set up the first corporation charter in America, the Charter of 1650, and named Danforth as the new treasurer. The corporate charter that Dunster established governs Harvard University to this day, and was only altered in 2010, when the Harvard Corporation expanded from a body of seven members, as first set up by Dunster, to thirteen members.

When Dunster abandoned the Puritan view of infant baptism in favor of believer&#x27;s baptism in 1653/54, he provoked a controversy that highlighted two distinct approaches to dealing with dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The colony&#x27;s Puritan leaders, whose own religion was born of dissent from the mainstream Church of England, generally worked for reconciliation with members who questioned matters of Puritan theology but responded much more harshly to outright rejection of Puritanism. Dunster&#x27;s conflict with the colony&#x27;s magistrates began when he failed to have his infant son baptized, believing that only adults should be baptized. Earnest efforts to restore Dunster to Puritan orthodoxy failed, and his heterodoxy proved untenable to colony leaders who had entrusted him, in his job as Harvard&#x27;s president, to uphold the colony&#x27;s religious mission. Thus, he represented a threat to the stability of society. Dunster exiled himself in 1654/55 and moved to nearby Plymouth Colony to become the minister of the First Church in Scituate, Massachusetts. Dunster died there on February 27, 1659 (or 1658 – Old Style calendar).

==Family and legacy==
Dunster married twice; both his wives were named Elizabeth. His first wife was Elizabeth (Harris) Glover, the owner of the first, and only, printing press in the colonies. They married on June 21, 1641. She died in 1643, leaving Dunster with land and property, including the printing press. Dunster married Elizabeth Atkinson (1627–1690) in 1644. Together they had five children.

Dunster House, one of the twelve residential houses of Harvard University, is named after Henry Dunster.

<text>David Brian Cone (born January 2, 1963) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher, and current color commentator for the New York Yankees on the YES Network and Amazon Prime as well as for ESPN on Sunday Night Baseball. A third round draft pick of the Kansas City Royals in the 1981 MLB draft, he made his MLB debut in 1986 and continued playing until 2003, pitching for five different teams. Cone batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

On the final game of the 1991 regular season, Cone struck out 19 batters, tied for second-most ever in a game. Renowned for his split-finger fastball, Cone won the 1994 American League Cy Young Award, was a five-time All-Star and led the major leagues in strikeouts each season from 1990 to 1992. He was a two-time 20 game-winner, setting the MLB record for most years between 20-win seasons with 10. Cone pitched the sixteenth perfect game in baseball history in 1999.

He was a member of five World Series championship teams: with the Toronto Blue Jays and , , and with the New York Yankees. His 8–3 career postseason record came over 21 games and 111 innings pitched, with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.80; in World Series play, his ERA was 2.12.

Cone is the subject of the book &quot;A Pitcher&#x27;s Story: Innings With David Cone&quot;, by Roger Angell. Cone and Jack Curry co-wrote the autobiography &quot;Full Count: The Education of a Pitcher&quot;, which was released in May 2019 and made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list shortly after its release.

==Early years==
Cone was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Joan (née Curran; 1936–2016) and Edwin Cone (1934–2022). He attended Rockhurst High School, a Jesuit school, where he played quarterback on the football team, leading them to the district championship. He was also a point guard on the basketball team. Because Rockhurst did not have a baseball team, Cone instead played summer ball in the Ban Johnson League, a college summer league in Kansas City. At 16, he reported to an invitation-only tryout at Royals Stadium and an open tryout for the St. Louis Cardinals. He was also recruited to play college football and baseball. Upon graduation, he enrolled at the University of Missouri and was drafted by his hometown Kansas City Royals in the third round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues and MLB debut: Kansas City Royals (1981–1986)===
Cone went 22–7 with a 2.21 earned run average in his first two professional seasons. He sat out 1983 with an injury, and went 8–12 with a 4.28 ERA for the Double-A Memphis Chicks when he returned in 1984. During his second season with the Class AAA Omaha Royals (1986), Cone was converted to a relief pitcher, and he made his Major League debut on June 8, 1986, in relief of reigning Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen. He made three more appearances out of the Royals&#x27; bullpen before returning to Omaha, where he went 8–4 with a 2.79 ERA. He returned to Kansas City when rosters expanded that September.

===New York Mets (1987–1992)===
Prior to the 1987 season, Cone was traded with Chris Jelic to the New York Mets for Ed Hearn, Rick Anderson and Mauro Gozzo. Cone went 5–6 with a 3.71 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 21 appearances (13 starts) his first season in New York City.

Cone began the 1988 season in the bullpen, but was added to the starting rotation by the first week of May. His first start was a complete game shutout over the Atlanta Braves, and he went on to post a 9–2 record with a 2.52 ERA in the first half of the season to earn his first All-Star nod. For the season, Cone went 20–3 with a 2.22 ERA to finish third in National League Cy Young Award balloting.

The Mets ran away with the National League East by fifteen games over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and were heavy favorites over the Los Angeles Dodgers, against whom they had a 10–1 record during the regular season, in the 1988 National League Championship Series.

Cone became a newspaper commentator on the playoffs for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and incited controversy after the Mets&#x27; 3–2 victory in game one by saying Dodgers game one starter Orel Hershiser &quot;was lucky for eight innings&quot;, and ripping closer Jay Howell:
After Cone provided the Dodgers with bulletin board material, Los Angeles jumped on Cone for five runs in two innings in the second game of the playoffs to tie the series at a game apiece. The Mets persuaded Cone to stop writing the column, and he came back with a scoreless ninth inning in a Game 3 Mets win and a complete-game victory in Game 6; however, series MVP and 1988 Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser came back in game seven with the complete game shutout to lead the Dodgers to the 1988 World Series against the Oakland Athletics.

In a well-known incident on April 30, 1990, against the Atlanta Braves, Cone covered first base on a throw from second baseman Gregg Jefferies, which should have retired batter Mark Lemke. Umpire Charlie Williams mistakenly ruled Lemke safe. Arguing with Williams, and thinking time had been called, Cone held the ball while two Braves runners (Dale Murphy and Ernie Whitt) scored.

Cone spent over five seasons in his first stint with the New York Mets, most of the time serving as the team&#x27;s co-ace alongside Dwight Gooden while leading the National League in strikeouts in 1990 and 1991. In 1991, Cone switched from uniform number 44 to 17 in honor of former teammate Keith Hernandez. On August 30, he struck out all three batters on nine total pitches in the fifth inning of a 3–2 win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the 16th National League pitcher and the 25th pitcher in major-league history to accomplish an immaculate inning.
Cone tied a National League record on October 6, in the season finale, by striking out 19 rival Philadelphia Phillies batters in a 7–0, three-hit shutout at Philadelphia. His 19 strikeouts was the second-highest total ever recorded in a nine-inning game just behind the 20-strikeout games recorded by Kerry Wood, Roger Clemens (twice), Randy Johnson and Max Scherzer, and tying Tom Seaver&#x27;s single-game club record, making the Mets the only team with two pitchers to achieve the feat.

Cone was the lone Mets representative at the 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, going 9–4 with a 2.56 ERA at the All-Star break. With a 56–67 record, and fourteen games behind the first place Pirates, the infamous &quot;worst team money could buy&quot; traded Cone to the Toronto Blue Jays for Jeff Kent and Ryan Thompson on August 27, 1992, after the non-waiver trading deadline.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1992)===
With Toronto, Cone was 4–3 with a 2.55 ERA and 47 strikeouts. Combined with the 214 strikeouts he had with the Mets, his 261 strikeouts led the major leagues and were career-highs. Cone headed to the postseason for the second time in his career as the Blue Jays won the American League East. The Jays defeated the Oakland Athletics in the 1992 American League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series, to give Cone his first World Series ring, and become the first Canadian team to win the World Series. For his part, Cone went 1–1 with a 3.22 ERA in the postseason. 

===Cy Young Award: Return to Kansas City Royals (1993–1994)===
Cone returned to his hometown Kansas City Royals as a free agent for the 1993 season. Despite an 11–14 record, Cone had an impressive 1993, pitching 254 innings with a 3.33 ERA, and a 138 ERA+. He improved to go 16–5 with a 2.94 ERA (171 ERA+) in the strike-shortened 1994 season to win the American League Cy Young Award, and finish ninth in MVP voting. Cone was a Major League Baseball Players Association representative in negotiations with Major League Baseball in events that surrounded the 1994 baseball strike.

===Toronto Blue Jays, second stint (1995)===
Four days after the strike ended, the Royals traded Cone back to the Blue Jays, in exchange for Chris Stynes, David Sinnes and Tony Medrano. Cone was 9–6 with a 3.38 ERA for Toronto, however, the Jays were 35–47 and in fifth place when they struck a deal with the second-place New York Yankees. On July 28, 1995, the Blue Jays sent Cone to the Yankees for Marty Janzen, Jason Jarvis and Mike Gordon.

===New York Yankees (1995–2000)===
When the Yankees acquired Cone, they were on a six-game winning streak, though still trailing the Boston Red Sox for the division lead. Cone instantly became the team&#x27;s ace and would post a 9–2 record as the Yankees won the wild card in the first season of the new three division, wild card format. In his third postseason, Cone won the first game of the 1995 American League Division Series against the Seattle Mariners, and left game five with the score tied at four. The Mariners won the game in extra innings to eliminate the Yankees from the playoffs.

The Yankees re-signed Cone in the offseason to a three-year contract worth $19.5 million. Cone was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA when he was diagnosed with an aneurysm in his arm in 1996 and went on the disabled list for the majority of the year. In his comeback start that September against the Oakland Athletics, Cone pitched a no-hitter through seven innings before he had to leave due to pitch count restrictions. Mariano Rivera allowed an infield single, ending the no-hit bid.

The Yankees returned to the postseason for the second consecutive season. After losing to the Texas Rangers in game one of the 1996 American League Division Series, and a no decision in the 1996 American League Championship Series, Cone came back in game three of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves with a six inning, one run performance to give the Yankees their first win of the Series on their way to their first World Championship in eighteen years.

Cone went 20–7 in 1998, setting a Major League record for the longest span between twenty-win seasons at 11, surpassing the record of 8 set by Jim Kaat in 1974. Cone won the 1998 American League Division Series clinching game against the Rangers, the 1998 American League Championship Series clinching game against the Indians, and Game Three of the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Cone finished fourth in the AL Cy Young voting.

He re-signed with the Yankees for the 1999 season for $8 million. He went 12–9 in 1999, pitching the sixteenth perfect game in baseball history on July 18 against the Montreal Expos. It was the last no-hitter by a Yankee until 2021, and also the first in a regular season interleague perfect game. Making the game even more remarkable was that it was &quot;Yogi Berra Day&quot; at Yankee Stadium. After a long feud with owner George Steinbrenner, Berra agreed to return to the stadium that day. Yogi caught the ceremonial first pitch from Don Larsen, who threw a perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series; that game had been caught by Yogi Berra. Larsen could be seen smiling in the press box after the final out of Cone&#x27;s perfect game was recorded. After the game, Cone was met at his clubhouse locker by Larsen and Berra, who together wrapped him in a bear hug.

After the perfect game, he seemed to suddenly lose effectiveness. It was the last shutout he would throw in his career. In 2000, he posted the worst record of his career, 4–14, while seeing his ERA balloon to 6.91, more than double his mark the previous year. In spite of his ineffectiveness, Cone was brought in during game four of the 2000 World Series to face the Mets&#x27; Mike Piazza, a controversial decision at the time—Denny Neagle had given up a home run to Piazza in his previous at-bat, but was pitching with a lead and only needed to retire Piazza to go the minimum five innings to be eligible for a win. Cone induced a pop-up to end the inning. It was the only batter he faced in the entire Series.

===Boston Red Sox (2001)===
Cone recognized after the 2000 season that his tenure with the Yankees was over. In 2001 Cone pitched for the rival Boston Red Sox, performing with mixed but mostly positive results, including a 9–7 win–loss record and a 4.31 ERA. His 2001 season included a suspenseful 1–0 loss against Yankees ace Mike Mussina wherein Cone pitched innings giving up one unearned run, keeping the game close even as Mike Mussina came within one strike of completing a perfect game, which would have made Cone the first pitcher to pitch a perfect game and be the losing pitcher in another.

===Comeback with New York Mets (2003)===
Cone sat out the 2002 season, but attempted a comeback with the Mets in 2003. Cone went 1–3 in four starts for the Mets with a 6.50 ERA. He announced his retirement soon after his last appearance for the Mets on May 28, citing a chronic hip problem.

=== Pitching style ===
Cone modeled his pitching after Luis Tiant. By emulating Tiant&#x27;s pitching style, it helped him conserve his arm. The drawback is that it put much wear and tear on his hips.

===Career statistics===

Cone&#x27;s .606 won-lost percentage ranks 95th on MLB all-time list; 7.77 hits allowed per nine innings pitched ranks 60th on MLB&#x27;s all-time list; 8.28 strikeouts per nine innings pitched ranks 17th; 2,668 strikeouts ranks 21st, and 419 games started ranks 97th on the MLB all-time list. Cone:

*Is the New York Yankees&#x27; all-time leader in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (8.67).
*Holds the New York Yankees&#x27; single-season record for most strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (10.25 in 1997).
*Struck out 19 batters in one game, October 6, 1991.
*Is the only pitcher to have a 20-win season with both the Mets (1988) and the Yankees (1998).

==Post-playing career==

Upon retiring from baseball in 2001, Cone became a color commentator on the YES Network during its inaugural season. However, his comeback attempt with the crosstown rival Mets in 2003 annoyed Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Cone was told he would not be welcomed back. After his second retirement from baseball, Cone was offered a broadcasting position with the Mets, but declined.

In 2008, Cone rejoined the YES Network as an analyst and host of &quot;Yankees on Deck&quot;. He left the YES Network during the 2009–10 offseason in order to &quot;spend more time with my family&quot;. He was replaced by former Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez. On April 19, 2011, Cone returned to the Yankees broadcast booth in Toronto, working as analyst for a Yankees-Blue Jays series along with Ken Singleton. As an announcer, he is known for making references to sabermetric statistics, referencing some websites such as Fangraphs.com. Cone is currently the Yankees&#x27; lead color commentator, alongside former teammate Paul O&#x27;Neill. The two are paired with Michael Kay as the Yankees&#x27; regular broadcast team.

After the 2021 season, Cone began co-hosting the podcast &quot;Toeing the Slab&quot; with Justin Shackil for Jomboy Media. In 2022, Cone was announced to be part of the &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; broadcast team on ESPN along with Karl Ravech, Eduardo Pérez, and Buster Olney.

On July 17, 2009, Cone testified as a witness (representing the Democratic Party) before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor. Cone read a prepared statement in support of Sotomayor&#x27;s nomination which chronicled Major League Baseball&#x27;s labor dispute of 1994 and the impact of the judge&#x27;s decision which forced the disputants back to the bargaining table. Cone said, &quot;It can be a good thing to have a judge in district court or a justice on the United States Supreme Court who recognizes that the law cannot always be separated from the realities involved in the disputes being decided.&quot;

==Personal life==
During his career in New York, Cone was known for his embrace of the city&#x27;s nightlife. He was falsely accused of rape in 1991, but within 72 hours the police found the claim to be without merit. In 1991, three women accused Cone of having threatened their lives at the ballpark. Cone said he had cursed them out for harassing the wife of teammate Sid Fernandez, but never threatened them. The three women later amended their lawsuit against Cone, accusing him of having lured them into the bullpen area at Shea Stadium in 1989 and masturbating in their presence. Two of the women&#x27;s claims were unsuccessful. One of the women settled her claims out of court based upon Cone calling her a &quot;groupie&quot;; all sexual accusations were dismissed.

Cone married Lynn DiGioia, an interior designer, on November 12, 1994. The couple had a son, Brian, on March 23, 2006. David and Lynn Cone divorced in 2011. Cone&#x27;s partner is real estate broker and investor Taja Abitbol. They have a son, Sammy, who was born on December 15, 2011.

<doc id="401022" wikidata="Q272628" url="?curid=401022" title="Jane Harman">
<text>Jane Margaret Harman (née Lakes, June 28, 1945) is an American former politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 1999 and again from 2001 to 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee (2002–2006), before she chaired the Homeland Security Committee&#x27;s Intelligence Subcommittee (2007–2011).

Resigning from Congress in February 2011, Harman became president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She succeeded former U.S. representative Lee Hamilton and was the first ever woman to lead the organization. She stepped down in February 2021 after a decade, and is a distinguished scholar and president emerita.

==Early life and education==
Harman was born Jane Margaret Lakes in New York City, the daughter of Lucille (née Geier) and Adolf N. Lakes. Her father was born in Poland and escaped from Nazi Germany in 1935; he worked as a medical doctor. Her mother was born in the United States and was the first in her family to receive a college education. Her maternal grandparents immigrated from Russia. Harman&#x27;s family moved to Los Angeles, California when she was 4 and there she attended Los Angeles public schools, graduating from University High School in 1962. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, from Smith College in 1966 and served as president of the Smith College Young Democrats. Harman continued her studies at Harvard Law School, where she earned her Juris Doctor degree in 1969.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduating from law school, Harman – then known as Jane Lakes – married future NOAA administrator Richard A. Frank in 1969, and they had two children. They spent a short time in Switzerland, and then she worked for two years as an associate with the law firm Surrey, Karasik and Morse in Washington, D.C. She began her political career by serving on the staff of Senator John V. Tunney, as his legislative assistant from 1972 to 1973. In 1973, Tunney named her his senior counsel and staff director for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights in 1975. During this time she also taught at Georgetown. When Tunney lost re-election in 1976, Harman – then known as &quot;Jane Lakes Frank&quot; – joined the Carter White House where she served as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet. She became a special counsel to the Department of Defense from 1979 to 1980.

===U.S. House, 1993 to 1999===
Harman was first elected to Congress in 1992 and became the first Smith College graduate to be elected to Congress. From 1993 to 1999, Harman represented California&#x27;s 36th district, serving in the 103rd, 104th, and 105th Congresses. In 1994, she barely survived reelection in a heavily Republican year, winning by 812 votes over Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Susan Brooks.

===1998 California gubernatorial campaign===

Harman did not run for the 106th United States Congress in 1998, instead entering the 1998 California gubernatorial race.

After losing the Democratic nomination to Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis, she briefly taught public policy and international relations at UCLA as a Regents&#x27; Professor before running for and winning her old congressional seat in the 2000 election.

===U.S. House, 2001 to 2011===

Harman narrowly won her old seat in 2000, defeating Republican incumbent Steven T. Kuykendall, before she was easily re-elected in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010.

Representing the aerospace center of California during her nine terms in Congress, she served on all the major security committees: six years on Armed Services, eight years on Intelligence, and eight on Homeland Security. She made numerous congressional fact-finding missions to hotspots around the world, including North Korea, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Guantanamo Bay. During her long public career, Harman has been recognized as a national expert at the nexus of security and public policy issues. She received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal in 1998, the CIA Agency Seal Medal in 2007, and the CIA Director&#x27;s Award, and the Director of National Intelligence Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2011.

Harman is a tenacious pro-Israeli, who used to have close ties to the U.S. intelligence community. She resigned in February 2011, to head the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, a foreign policy think tank.

===2009 wiretap/AIPAC allegations===
In 2009, it was revealed NSA wiretaps reportedly intercepted a 2005 phone call between Harman and an agent of the Israeli government, in which Harman allegedly agreed to lobby the Justice Department to reduce or drop criminal charges against two employees of AIPAC in exchange for increased support for Harman&#x27;s campaign to chair the House Intelligence Committee.

Harman denied the allegations, and called for the government to release the full transcript of the wire-tapped conversation, something they never did. In June 2009, Harman received a letter from the Justice Department and House Ethics Committee declaring her &quot;neither a subject nor a target of an ongoing investigation by the Criminal Division.&quot; The espionage charges were later dropped on the two employees from AIPAC.

===Political positions===
Harman is on most issues a liberal, earning a 95% rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action. On intelligence and defense issues, Ben Pershing described her as a centrist. For example, she was one of many Democrats who supported the Iraq War. Harman has combined a moderate stance on economic, trade, and foreign policy issues with liberal stances on social issues.

====Armenian genocide====
Harman was a co-sponsor of the Armenian genocide recognition resolution bill in 2007. However, while still cosponsoring the bill, she wrote a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Tom Lantos urging him to delay a floor vote on the legislation. Her argument was that while the genocide deserved recognition, it was not a good time to embarrass Turkey, given that country&#x27;s role in moderating extremism in the Middle East.

===Other activities===

Harman served as a member of the Defense Policy Board, the State Department Foreign Affairs Policy Board, the Director of National Intelligence’s Senior Advisory Group, and the Homeland Security Advisory Council. She was a member of the CIA External Advisory Board from 2011 to 2013. Harman is a Trustee of the Aspen Institute and an Honorary Trustee of the University of Southern California. She also serves on the Presidential Debates Commission and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

She is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and serves on the Executive Committees of the Trilateral Commission and the Munich Security Conference.

==Personal life==
Harman&#x27;s first marriage was to Richard Frank, in 1969, with whom she had two children. Her second marriage was to audio pioneer and multi-millionaire Sidney Harman, who served from 1977 to 1979 as the Undersecretary of the Department of Commerce in the Carter administration before repurchasing the company he founded, Harman International Industries, and later taking it public. She also had two children with him. She has eight grandchildren.

Sidney Harman retired in 2008 from Harman Industries, purchased &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine in 2010, and founded the Academy for Polymathic Study at USC before he died in April 2011. Harman maintains her residence in Venice Beach, California, and has homes in Washington, D.C., and Aspen, Colorado.

Harman was a good friend of Senator Dianne Feinstein, and was among the last people to visit Feinstein prior to her death in 2023.

<doc id="401024" wikidata="Q185958" url="?curid=401024" title="Float (project management)">
<text>In project management, float or slack is the amount of time that a task in a project network can be delayed without causing a delay to:
* subsequent tasks (&quot;&quot;free float&quot;)
* project completion date (&quot;total float&quot;&quot;).

&quot;Total float&quot; is associated with the path. If a project network chart/diagram has 4 non-critical paths, then that project would have 4 &quot;total float&quot; values. The &quot;total float&quot; of a path is the combined &quot;free float&quot; values of all activities in a path.

The &quot;total float&quot; represents the schedule flexibility and can also be measured by subtracting early start dates from late start dates of path completion. Float is core to critical path method, with the total floats of noncritical activities key to computing the critical path drag of an activity, i.e., the amount of time it is adding to the project&#x27;s duration.

==Example==
Consider the process of replacing a broken pane of glass in the window of your home. There are various component activities involved in the project as a whole; obtaining the glass and putty, installing the new glass, choosing the paint, obtaining a tin once it has set, wiping the new glass free of finger smears etc.

Some of these activities can run concurrently e.g. obtaining the glass, obtaining the putty, choosing the paint etc., while others are consecutive e.g. the paint cannot be bought until it has been chosen, the new window cannot be painted until the window is installed and the new putty has set. Delaying the acquisition of the glass is likely to delay the entire project - this activity will be on the critical path and have no float, of any sort, attached to it and hence it is a &#x27;critical activity&#x27;. A relatively short delay in the purchase of the paint may not automatically hold up the entire project as there is still some waiting time for the new putty to dry before it can be painted anyway - there will be some &#x27;free float&#x27; attached to the activity of purchasing the paint and hence it is not a critical activity. However, a delay in choosing the paint, in turn, inevitably delays buying the paint which, although it may not subsequently mean any delay to the entire project, does mean that choosing the paint has no &#x27;free float&#x27; attached to it - despite having no free float of its own, the choosing of the paint is involved with a path through the network which does have &#x27;total float&#x27;.

<doc id="401032" wikidata="Q160853" url="?curid=401032" title="Republic F-84 Thunderjet">
<text>The Republic F-84 Thunderjet is an American turbojet fighter-bomber aircraft. Originating as a 1944 United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) proposal for a &quot;day fighter&quot;, the F-84 first flew in 1946. Although it entered service in 1947, the Thunderjet was plagued by such a large amount of structural and engine problems that a 1948 U.S. Air Force review declared it unable to execute any aspect of its intended mission and considered canceling the program. The aircraft was not considered fully operational until the 1949 F-84D model and the design matured only with the definitive F-84G introduced in 1951. In 1954, the straight-wing Thunderjet was joined by the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak fighter and RF-84F Thunderflash photo reconnaissance aircraft.

The Thunderjet became the USAF&#x27;s primary strike aircraft during the Korean War, flying 86,408 sorties and destroying 60% of all ground targets in the war as well as eight Soviet-built MiG fighters. Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served with NATO nations, and it was the first aircraft to fly with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team. The USAF Strategic Air Command had F-84 Thunderjets in service from 1948 through 1957.

The F-84 was the first production fighter aircraft to utilize inflight refueling and the first fighter capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, the Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the FICON and Tom-Tom dockings to the B-29 Superfortress and B-36 bomber motherships, and the experimental XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop.

The F-84 nomenclature can be somewhat confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop version of the F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version was intended to be a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only a few different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.

==Design and development==
In 1944, Republic Aviation&#x27;s chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, began working on a turbojet-powered replacement for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter aircraft. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the Thunderbolt&#x27;s fuselage. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a much-slimmer fuselage housing an axial compressor turbojet engine in the rear fuselage, and an air intake in the nose of the fuselage, with air ducts running from the nose to the engine and taking up much of the fuselage volume. Fuel was mainly stored in tanks in the thick, but laminar flow airfoil, unswept wings.

On 11 September 1944, the USAAF released General Operational Requirements for a day fighter with a top speed of , a combat radius of , and armament of either eight or six machine guns. In addition, the new aircraft had to use the General Electric TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the Allison J35. These specifications proved to be too ambitious, however, and the radius requirement was reduced to and the armament suite was reduced to six .50-caliber or four .60-caliber machine guns in order to reduce weight.

On 11 November 1944, Republic received an order for three prototypes of the new XP-84—known to Republic as the Model AP-23. Since the design promised superior performance to the Lockheed-built P-80 Shooting Star and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name &quot;Thunderjet&quot; was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 Thunderbolt, while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On 4 January 1945, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF placed an additional order for 25 service test YP-84As and 75 production P-84Bs (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B).

Meanwhile, wind tunnel testing by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics revealed longitudinal instability and stabilizer skin buckling at high speeds. The weight of the aircraft, a great concern given the low thrust of early turbojets, was growing so quickly that the USAAF had to set a gross weight limit of . The results of this preliminary testing were incorporated into the third prototype, designated &quot;XP-84A&quot;, which was also fitted with a more powerful J35-GE-15 engine with of thrust.

The first prototype XP-84 was rolled out in December 1945, but availability of suitable engines delayed flight testing. The first prototype was transferred to Muroc Army Air Field (present-day Edwards Air Force Base) where it flew for the first time on 28 February 1946 with Major Wallace A. &quot;Wally&quot; Lien at the controls. It was joined by the second prototype in August, both aircraft flying with J35-GE-7 engines producing . On 8 September 1946, the second XP-84 set a US national airspeed record of , but failed to match the world speed record of set the day before by a British Gloster Meteor. The effort to break the speed record delayed the test program with the second prototype. The 15 YP-84As, which were delivered to Patterson Field (present-day Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) for service tests from January 1947, differed from XP-84s by having an upgraded J35-A-15 engine, carrying six 0.50 in M2 Browning machine guns (four in the nose and one in each wing root), and having the provision for wingtip fuel tanks holding each.

Due to delays with delivery of jet engines and production of the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on the aircraft&#x27;s structure was not thoroughly studied. This proved problematic later. After the creation of the United States Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, the &quot;Pursuit&quot; designation was replaced with &quot;Fighter&quot;, and the P-84 became the F-84.

The F-84B, which differed from the YP-84A only in having faster-firing M3 machine guns (later F-84s also had provision to carry eight High Velocity Aircraft Rockets (HVAR) underwing), became operational with 14th Fighter Group at Dow Field, Bangor, Maine, in December 1947. Flight restrictions followed immediately, limiting maximum speed to Mach 0.8 due to control reversal, and limiting maximum acceleration to 5.5 g-force (54 m/s2) due to wrinkling of the fuselage skin. To compound the problem, parts shortages and maintenance difficulties earned the aircraft the nickname, &quot;Mechanic&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. On 24 May 1948, the entire F-84B fleet was grounded due to structural failures in the aircraft&#x27;s wings. The F-84C featured a somewhat more reliable J35-A-13C engine of the same power as the A-15-C used by the F-84B, and modified fuel and electrical systems. Beyond these modifications, the F-84C was virtually identical to the F-84B, and suffered from the same defects.

A 1948 review of the F-84 program discovered that none of the F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a compromise, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8 million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs and F-84Cs, most notably reinforcing the wings to a similar standard to the F-84D. Despite the resultant improvements, both the F-84B and F-84C were withdrawn from service during 1952.

The structural improvements were factory-implemented in the F-84D, which entered service in 1949. Wings were covered with thicker aluminum skin, the fuel system was winterized and capable of using JP-4 fuel, and a more powerful J35-A-17D engine with was fitted. It had been discovered that the untested wingtip fuel tanks contributed to wing structural failures by inducing excessive twisting during high-g maneuvers. To correct this, small triangular fins were added to the outside of the tanks. The F-84D was phased out of USAF service in 1952 and left Air National Guard (ANG) service in 1957.

The first effective and fully capable Thunderjet was the F-84E model which entered service in 1950. The aircraft featured the J35-A-17 engine, further wing reinforcement, a fuselage extension in front of the wings and extension aft of the wings to enlarge the cockpit and the avionics bay, an A-1B gunsight with AN/APG-30 range-finding radar, and provision for an additional pair of fuel tanks to be carried on underwing pylons. The latter increased the combat radius from to over .

One improvement to the original F-84 design was rocket racks that folded flush with the wing after the 5-inch HVAR rockets were fired, which reduced drag over the older fixed mounting racks. This innovation was adopted by other US jet fighter-bombers.
Despite the improvements, the in-service rates for the F-84E remained poor with only half of the aircraft operational in April 1950. This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison&#x27;s ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, serving with the Air Force Reserve until 1957 and lingering with ANG units until 1959.

The final straight-wing F-84 was the F-84G, intended as a stop-gap until the swept wing F-84F entered service, but ordered in large numbers to build-up NATO air forces. It introduced a refueling boom receptacle in the left wing, autopilot, Instrument Landing System, J35-A-29 engine with of thrust, a distinctive framed canopy (also retrofitted to earlier types), and the ability to carry a single Mark 7 nuclear bomb. The F-84G entered service in 1951, although deliveries were slowed by shortages of engines. Production continued until July 1953 with 3,025 F-84Gs delivered, with 789 going to the USAF and 2,236 to US allies as part of US military aid. The F-84G was retired from the USAF in mid-1960.

===Flying the Thunderjet===
Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet&#x27;s takeoff performance left much to be desired. In hot Korean summers with a full combat load, the aircraft routinely required of runway for takeoff even with the help of RATO bottles (two or four of these were carried, each producing 1,000 lbf (4.4 kN) of thrust for 14 seconds). All but the lead aircraft had their visibility obscured by the thick smoke from the rockets. F-84s had to be pulled off the ground at 160 mph (140 kn, 260 km/h) with the control stick held all the way back. Landings were made at a similar speed. For comparison, the North American P-51 Mustang landed at approximately 120 mph (100 kn, 190 km/h). Despite the &quot;hot&quot; landing speeds, the Thunderjet was easy to fly on instruments and crosswinds did not present much of a problem.

Thanks to the thick straight wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes resulted in a violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above , the F-84 could be flown faster but at the expense of severe buffeting. However, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000 ft possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3 gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic&#x27;s legendary ruggedness.

Pilots nicknamed the Thunderjet &quot;The Lead Sled&quot;. It was also called &quot;The Iron Crowbar&quot;, &quot;a hole sucking air&quot;, &quot;The Hog&quot; (&quot;The Groundhog&quot;), and &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Tricycle&quot;, &quot;Ground Loving Whore&quot; as a testament to its long takeoff rolls. F-84 lore stated that all aircraft were equipped with a &quot;sniffer&quot; device that, upon passing takeoff safety speed, would look for the dirt at the end of the runway. As soon as the device could smell the dirt, the controls would turn on and let the pilot fly off the ground. In the same vein, it was suggested a bag of dirt should be carried in the front landing gear well. Upon reaching takeoff safety speed, the pilot would dump the dirt under the wheels, fooling the sniffer device.

===Korean War===
The Thunderjet had a distinguished record during the Korean War. After the entry of the People&#x27;s Republic of China into the war in October 1950, the US Fifth Air Force requested that a wing of F-84s be sent to Korea. While the F-84B and F-84C could not be deployed overseas because their J35 engines had a service life of only 40 hours, the F-84D and F-84E were more suitable, and so the F-84E-equipped 27th Fighter Escort Group was sent to the Far East aboard the aircraft carrier , which arrived in Japan on 30 November 1950. After maintenance, the F-84s moved to Taegu airfield (known as K-2), flying its first operational missions on 7 December 1950. The aircraft were initially tasked with escorting the B-29 Superfortress bombers. The first Thunderjet air-to-air victory was scored on 21 January 1951 at the cost of two F-84s. The F-84 was outmatched by the swept-wing Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, which was both faster and more manoeuvrable, and the MiG counter-air mission was soon given to the F-86 Sabre. The F-84 switched to the ground attack role at which it excelled.

The number of units operating the F-84 over Korea gradually increased, both by bringing over Air National Guard Groups from the US, and converting F-80 squadrons already in theater. The F-84 flew a total of 86,408 missions, dropping 55,586 tons (50,427 metric tons) of bombs and 6,129 tons (5,560 metric tons) of napalm, and firing 22,154 rockets. The USAF claimed F-84s were responsible for 60% of all ground targets destroyed in the war. Notable F-84 operations included the 1952 attack on the Sui-ho Dam. During the war, the F-84 became the first USAF fighter to utilize aerial refueling. In aerial combat, F-84 pilots were credited with eight MiG-15 kills against a Soviet-claimed loss of 64 aircraft. The total losses were 335 F-84D, E and G models. According to the USAF FY1953 statistical digest, during the Korean war, 305 F-84s were lost, including 249 in combat missions and 56 non-combat losses.

===Western Europe===
Air battle over Merklín - 
A notable incident occurred on 10 March 1953, when two Czech MiG-15 fighters intercepted two US Air Force F-84Es that were claimed to have strayed from German to Czechoslovakian airspace and shot one down. It crashed on the German side of the border and the pilot successfully ejected.

===Portugal===
Portugal received its first F-84s in January 1953, with 25 new build F-84Gs later supplemented by USAFE stocks and from other European operators, with deliveries eventually reaching 125 F-84Gs. They were the &quot;Força Aérea Portuguesa&quot;&#x27;s first operational jet fighters. Two squadrons were formed in Portugal, operating the F-84 in both air-defense and ground attack roles, with the Thunderjet also equipping an aerobatic display team, the &quot;Dragões&quot;. In 1960, the two operational F-84 squadrons were disbanded and the remaining F-84s transferred to training units. In 1961, however, an uprising against Portuguese rule began in Angola, and as a result, 25 F-84Gs were refurbished by OGMA and sent to Angola, with the first aircraft arriving at Luanda in August that year. There, they formed the &quot;Esquadra 91&quot; (91st Squadron), carrying out bomb, rocket and gun attacks against separatist forces. In 1966, after Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and the imposition of the Beira Patrol by the British Royal Navy to attempt to stop the flow of fuel to Rhodesia via the port of Beira, Mozambique, a detachment of eight F-84s was sent from Luanda to Mozambique to guard against potential clashes with British forces, with the aircraft returning to Angola when the threat of military action receded. Attrition of the F-84s was heavy, and by 1973, only five F-84s remained operational, with the last examples withdrawn from use that year, although the F-84G nominally remained in Portuguese service until October 1975.

===Republic of China===
The Republic of China Air Force received surplus F-84Gs from the USAF from 1953, and during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, its F-84s engaging in air-to-air combat against People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force MiG-15s and MiG-17 fighters, with losses on both sides. The Republic of China replaced its Thunderjets with F-100s from later that year.

===Notable achievements===
* The F-84 was the first aircraft flown by the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, which operated F-84G Thunderjets from 1953 to 1955 and F-84F Thunderstreaks from 1955 to 1956. The F-84E was also flown by the team of United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE).
* On 7 September 1946, the second XP-84 prototype set a national speed record of 607.2 mph (527.6 kn, 977.2 km/h), slightly slower than the world record 612.2 mph (532.0 kn, 985.2 km/h) held by the British Gloster Meteor. None of these records exceeded the April 1941 wartime achievement of an Me 163A rocket plane at some 624.2 mph; itself first exceeded by the American Douglas D-558-1 &quot;Skystreak&quot; in August 1947, using basically the same Allison J35 turbojet engine as the F-84. 
* On 22 September 1950, two EF-84Es, flown by David C. Schilling and Col. William Ritchie, refuelled using the probe and drogue system from Avro Lincoln tankers operated by the British company Flight Refuelling Limited, flew across the North Atlantic from Great Britain to the United States. Ritchie&#x27;s aircraft ran out of fuel over Newfoundland, but the other successfully made the crossing, which took 10 hours and 2 minutes and three aerial refuelings. The flight demonstrated that large numbers of fighters could be rapidly moved across the Atlantic.
* The F-84G was the first fighter with built-in aerial refueling capability and the first single-seat aircraft capable of carrying a nuclear bomb.
* On 20 August 1953, 17 F-84Gs of the 508th Strategic Fighter Wing using aerial refueling flew from the United States to the United Kingdom. The journey was the longest-ever nonstop flight by jet fighters at the time.
* In 1955, an F-84G became the first aircraft to be zero-length launched from a trailer.

<text>Charles William Blunt (born 19 January 1951) is a former Australian politician who served as leader of the National Party of Australia from 1989 to 1990.

==Early life==
Blunt was born in Sydney and graduated from the University of Sydney with a degree in economics. After working in various positions he was hired as New South Wales State Director of the National Party.

==Politics==
At a by-election on 18 February 1984, Blunt was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Richmond in northern New South Wales, despite having had no previous connections with the area. He succeeded the former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the NPA, Doug Anthony, who had resigned his seat.

Blunt was immediately promoted to the opposition front bench, serving as shadow Minister for Social Services. He was returned to parliament at the 1984 and 1987 general elections.

==Leader of the National Party==
In 1989 Blunt organised a leadership coup against the veteran leader of the NPA, Ian Sinclair. He aimed to modernise the NPA and bring it into closer alignment with the Liberal Party, particularly on issues of economic deregulation. He was also more socially liberal than most NPA members.

Unfortunately for Blunt, neither of these things was popular with rank and file NPA members, and he found his leadership under increasing attack from traditionalists. At the same time the seat of Richmond, which had been held by the NPA and its predecessor the Country Party since 1922, was becoming more urbanised. Some argue that the growing unpopularity of the National Party state government in Queensland influenced federal voting intentions. Richmond sits across the Tweed River from the Gold Coast, and the two areas share a television market. However, the seat had actually become more marginal in the latter part of Doug Anthony&#x27;s tenure. The anti-war campaigner Helen Caldicott announced that she would oppose Blunt in his electorate at the next election.

The culmination of these trends was a swing against the NPA at the 1990 election, at which the Hawke Labor government was re-elected. Blunt was defeated in his own seat of Richmond. He went into the election holding Richmond with a majority of six percent, just barely outside the range of being safe. However, he had no local connections, which worked against him in a country seat. Labor challenger Neville Newell won the seat on the seventh count after Caldicott&#x27;s preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him, allowing him to take the seat on a swing of seven percent. It was only the second time that the leader of a major Australian party had lost his own seat in an election; the first was Stanley Bruce, the then Prime Minister, who not only led his party to defeat in 1929 election but also lost his own seat of Flinders. The NPA also lost the adjoining seat of Page, both campaigns being heavily influenced by Queensland media.

After the election, Blunt was again the focus of political controversy when he was accused of inappropriately using publicly funded mailouts of election-related material:

After an investigation Blunt was found not to have breached any rules, and the matter was dropped.

==Later life==
After leaving politics Blunt went into business. He led a number of trade and investment missions to the United States and was a regular speaker at international trade and investment outlook conferences. In 1992 he became National Director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia, resigning in 2013. He is also currently chair of a number of publicly listed companies, including Capital Trade and Policy and Palamedia.

In 2014, Blunt appeared in a documentary about the Nationals, &quot;A Country Road: The Nationals&quot; in which he talked about his time as Nationals leader. On the same programme, John Sharp, a Nationals MP at the time of Blunt&#x27;s leadership, said that in hindsight it was a mistake for Sinclair to be replaced as leader by Blunt.

<text>Snowflake was a low-cost airline that operated out of Stockholm, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark between 30 March 2003 and 30 October 2004. Owned by the SAS Group, it was organized as a business unit within Scandinavian Airlines, operating as a virtual airline using their crew and aircraft. Snowflake served a total 28 destinations from its bases at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Copenhagen Airport.

The concept was launched using four Boeing 737-800 aircraft. It mainly served Mediterranean holiday destinations, as well as destinations popular with expatriates. From March 2004 two 737 aircraft were replaced with two McDonnell Douglas MD-82s. The airline underestimated its costs and achieved an insufficient load factor, thus making services unprofitable. After operations ended, SAS continued to use &quot;Snowflake&quot; as a brand for discounted tickets to European destinations.

==History==
In 2003 SAS underwent a major restructuring program, which largely focused on reducing unit costs. As part of the program, the company&#x27;s management, in cooperation with McKinsey &amp; Company devised a scheme to better target the leisure market. The models of Ryanair and SAS&#x27; partner airline Lufthansa&#x27;s low-cost subsidiary Germanwings were examined. SAS had just bought its main Norwegian competitor, Braathens, and had also significantly reduced Swedish domestic competition through the purchase of Linjeflyg. The airline was worried about new entrants in these markets, in particular about Ryanair and EasyJet.
The SAS Group announced plans for the airline on 10 December 2002, at the time giving it the provisional name &quot;Scandinavian Light&quot;. The company stated that they aimed to create a low-cost airline which would focus on the leisure holiday market and on Mediterranean destinations. SAS hoped that the new airline would target a different market than Scandinavian Airlines and that the latter could instead focus on the business. A challenge for the company was at the time that it had overcapacity after a recent drop in passenger numbers.

The &quot;Snowflake&quot; brand was announced on 19 March 2003 and services commenced on 30 March. Four Boeing 737-800 were transferred to the new airline and painted in a new livery. Two were stationed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and two at Copenhagen Airport. SAS chose not to launch the service in Norway. It considered the newly formed SAS Braathens to be a lost-cost carrier and did not see the need for differentiation in the Norwegian market. Ticket prices started at 279 Swedish krona (SEK) and 295 Danish kroner (DKK) plus taxes. About ten seats per departure were sold at that price.
The first services were from Stockholm to Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Bologna, Budapest, Dublin, Istanbul, Málaga, Nice, Prague and Rome. From Copenhagen the airline&#x27;s first flights were to Alicante, Athens, Bologna, Lisbon, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, Pristina and Sarajevo. The latter two were particularly aimed at expatriates, rather than tourists. By May the airline had achieved a load factor of seventy percent, increasing to eighty-two percent by September. Snowflake then announced three new destinations from Stockholm from the start of the winter program in October: Lyon, Beograd and Beirut. The latter two were mainly aimed at expatriates. A new fare scheme was introduced from 1 October, whereby there were eight price levels, ranging from €58 to €228. It also started offering discounted booking fees for tickets bought online. In November Snowflake announced that it would end services to Dublin and Barcelona, citing low profitability. Scandinavian Airlines started to serving Dublin itself.
Snowflake was hit by a strike within the SAS Group starting on 1 February 2004 amongst ground handlers. From February Snowflake introduced services from Stockholm to Bilbao and Olbia. Starting with the 2004 summer schedule, commencing 28 March, SAS introduced additional services. From Copenhagen the airline started flights to Ankara, Beirut, Skopje, Split and Valletta. From Stockholm services were introduced to Ankara, Inverness, Lisbon, Palma de Mallorca, Split, Skope and Valletta. At the same time two more aircraft, 156-seat McDonnell Douglas MD-82s, were introduced to the Snowflake fleet.

In May 2004 the load factor drop to forty percent. Snowflake announced large cutbacks to the winter schedule, and planned to only operate four services: to Athens, Istanbul, Nice and Rome. This was down from thirteen during the previous winter season. With two flights each per week, this resulted in a very low fleet utilization rate. Snowflake had originally had success with their expatriate routes, but from 2004 passenger numbers fluctuated significantly on those routes. Similar cuts were carried out in Copenhagen: services were reduced to ten per week. This included the announcement of a new destination – Cairo. Two services, to Dublin and Prague, were taken over from Stockholm by Scandinavian Airlines. A further four destinations were cut with the winter program. All services to Spain were taken over by Spanair, which at the time was also owned by the SAS Group.
The load factor increased to eighty percent during the summer months. SAS announced on 18 August 2004 that it would terminate Snowflake services with effect 30 October. &quot;Snowflake&quot; would continue to exist as a brand name for discount tickets to European destinations.

==Operations==
Snowflake&#x27;s business model was not the same as that of Scandinavian Airlines. Snowflake was organized as a business unit with in SAS Group, in the same manner as Scandinavian Airlines. The airline was thereby just a brand employed for particular services. The aircraft operated with Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; aircraft, crew and codes. The two also shared management. Snowflake was organized to become an internal customer within the group, for instance purchasing ground services from SAS Ground Services.

A key component to the operations was that the Snowflake services would be able to operate at a lower cost than the main airline. However, it soon proved that the company was not able to achieve the internal prices that were used in calculating costs. For instance, Snowflake incurred the same ground handling costs as Scandinavian Airlines. No discounts were therefore granted from SAS Ground Services or external ground handling providers. Similarly, if a Snowflake aircraft became sufficiently delayed, a conventional SAS aircraft would be dispatched instead.
Snowflake was able to avoid many of the costs related to operating a network system. To begin with it operated only a single type of aircraft. These started and ended each day at their home base, avoiding accommodation costs for crews. The Snowflake business unit employed only five people.

Snowflake incurred the same overhead costs as Scandinavian; the lack of a clear separation between the airlines at an operational level meant that Snowflake never succeeded in lowering unit costs below that of Scandinavian Airlines. Finally, operating only four aircraft was too small a fleet to achieve the necessary economy of scale. With the ticket prices based on cost savings which never materialized, the airline failed to operate with a profit.

==Service==
Tickets were sold online and by telephone. They had a lower base price, additional services, including in-flight meals cost extra. Surcharges were also charged by travel agencies, which sold tickets for an interim period. The airline only operated point-to-point services, rather than the network model used by Scandinavian Airline. Tickets were sold one-way and did not require a round trip and staying away over a Saturday to claim discounts. However, they did not support interlining.
Standard fare included one piece of checked-in luggage. The airline had a selection of in-flight meals, food and beverages for sale. Customers could redeem miles earned through SAS&#x27; loyalty program Eurobonus, but miles could not be earned on flights with Snowflake. Snowflake services were popular for redemption because of the concentration of leisure destinations.

==Fleet==
The airline initially operated a fleet of four Boeing 737-800, with two aircraft based in Stockholm and two in Copenhagen. From March 2004 the two 737s in Copenhagen were replaced with two McDonnell Douglas MD-82. All aircraft were owned and operated by Scandinavian Airlines, but retained a distinctive livery with a lemon-colored vertical stabilizer and otherwise white body. They had single-class seating in a more dense configuration than in SAS&#x27; conventional aircraft. All the aircraft were registered in Norway.

==Destinations==
Snowflake operated flights to a series of destinations from its bases in Copenhagen and Stockholm. They flew out of Terminal 2 at Copenhagen and Terminal 5 at Stockholm. Most flights had a limited frequency, typically one to four times per week. Flights operated to primary airports and not remote airports. To avoid cannibalizing customers from Scandinavian Airlines, Snowflake only flew to destinations not served by the other part of the group. This included several popular tourist destinations, such as London and Paris, which also attracted a large share of business travelers.
