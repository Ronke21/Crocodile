<doc id="405660" wikidata="Q180524" url="?curid=405660" title="List of martial arts">
<text>There are many distinct styles and schools of martial arts. Sometimes, schools or styles are introduced by individual teachers or masters, or as a brand name by a specific gym. Martial arts can be grouped by type or focus, or alternatively by regional origin. This article focuses on the latter grouping of these unique styles of martial arts.

For Hybrid martial arts, as they originated from the late 19th century and especially after 1950, it may be impossible to identify unique or predominant regional origins. It is not trivial to distinguish &quot;traditional&quot; from &quot;modern&quot; martial arts. Chronology is not the decisive criterion, as, for example, &quot;traditional&quot; Taekwondo was developed in the 1950s, while the &quot;modern&quot; hybrid martial art of Bartitsu was developed .

A large portion of traditional martial arts can be categorized as Folk wrestling (see the separate article), although in some cases a folk wrestling style and a modern combat sport may overlap or become indistinguishable from each other once the sport has been regulated.

<text>A &#x27; ( , ) or &#x27; () is a traditional Scottish and Irish social gathering. In its most basic form, it simply means a social visit. In contemporary usage, it usually involves dancing and playing Gaelic folk music, either at a home or a larger concert at a social hall or other community gathering place.

 (plural of ) and (plural of ) originated in the Gaelic areas of Scotland and Ireland and are consequently common in the Scottish and Irish diasporas. They are similar to the traditions in Cornwall and and events in Wales, &quot;merry neets&quot; in Cumbria and North East England, as well as English country dance throughout England which have in some areas undergone a fusion with céilithe.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the Old Irish (singular) meaning &#x27;companion&#x27;. It later became and , which means &#x27;visit&#x27; in Gaelic. In Scottish Gaelic reformed spelling it is spelt (plural ) and in Irish reformed spelling as (plural ).

==History==
Originally, a was a social gathering of any sort, and did not necessarily involve dancing:


In recent decades, the dancing portion of the event has usurped the older meanings of the term, though the tradition of guests performing music, songs, storytelling, and poetry still persists in some areas.

/&quot;Cèilidhean&quot; were originally hosted by a (or, in contemporary Scottish Gaelic orthography, &quot;fear-an-taighe&quot;), meaning &#x27;man of the house&#x27;. The Scottish Gaelic feminine and gender-neutral equivalents are &quot;bean-an-taighe&quot; (woman of the house) and &quot;duine-an-taighe&quot; (person of the house), respectively. The use of these or similar terms is still the form in much of Ireland and Hebridean Scotland, and at gatherings elsewhere at which either Irish or Scottish Gaelic is the predominant social language. In modern events at which English predominates, the host is usually instead referred to as simply the &quot;host&quot; or &quot;master of ceremonies&quot;.

==Modern &quot;cèilidhean&quot;==
The facilitated courting and prospects of marriage for young people and, although discos and nightclubs have displaced the to a considerable extent, such events are still an important and popular social outlet in rural parts of Scotland and Ireland, especially in the Gaelic-speaking regions. are sometimes held on a smaller scale in private or public houses, for example in remote rural areas and during busy festivals.

It is common for some clubs and institutions such as sports clubs, schools and universities and even employers to arrange cèilidhs on a regular—or at least annual—basis. The formality of these can vary. Some mix modern pop music with a Scottish country dancing band and dress codes range from compulsory highland dress to informal. Knowledge and use of the basic dance steps is not always strictly necessary, and dances often alternate with songs, poetry recitals, storytelling and other types of &quot;party pieces&quot;.

Cèilidh music may be provided by an assortment of instruments including fiddle, flute, tin whistle, accordion, bodhrán (frame-drum), hammered dulcimer, and in more recent times also drums, guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, Scottish smallpipes, and electric bass guitar. The music is cheerful and lively, consisting in Ireland mainly of jigs, reels, hornpipes, polkas, slip-jigs, and waltzes, with Scotland adding strathspeys, and England adding regional forms such as the northeastern rant. The basic steps can be learned easily; a short instructional session is often provided for new dancers before the start of the dance itself. In Ireland, the first band was put together in 1926 by Séamus Clandillon, Radio Éireann&#x27;s director of music, to have dance music for his studio-based programmes.

Dancing at is usually in the form of cèilidh dances, set dances, or couples&#x27; dances. A &quot;set&quot; consists of four to eight couples, with each pair of couples facing another in a square or rectangular formation. Each couple exchanges position with the facing couple, and also facing couples exchange partners, while all the time keeping in step with the beat of the music.

About half of the dances in the modern Scots , however, are couples&#x27; dances performed in a ring. These can be performed by fixed couples or in the more sociable &quot;progressive&quot; manner, with the lady moving to the next gentleman in the ring at or near the end of each repetition of the steps. In Ireland, the similar style of dance is called dance or (&#x27;true&#x27;) dance. Some of the dances are named after famous regiments, historical battles, and events, others after items of daily rural life. The &quot;gay Gordons&quot;, &quot;siege of Ennis&quot;, &quot;walls of Limerick&quot;, and &quot;stack of barley&quot; are popular dances in this genre.

Step dancing is another form of dancing often performed at , the form that was popularised in the 1990s by the Riverdance ensemble. Whereas set dancing involves all present, whatever their skill, step dancing is usually reserved for show, being performed only by the most talented of dancers.

The has been internationalised by the Scottish and Irish diasporas in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, where local and traditional music competitions are held. In recent years, and traditional music competitions have been frequently won by descendants of emigrants.

It bears mention that are common throughout Nova Scotia. The tradition and the spirit of these gatherings are carried on in most small communities of these Maritime Provinces.

===In Scotland===
Privately organised in the 2020s are extremely common in both rural and urban Scotland, where bands are hired, usually for evening entertainment for a wedding, birthday party, celebratory or fundraising event. These may be more or less formal, and very often omit all other traditional Gaelic activity beyond the actual music and dancing. Novices are usually among the participants, so a &quot;dance caller&quot; may teach the steps before music begins for each dance. The more versatile bands will demonstrate the dances too. Scottish primary schools frequently teach some Scottish country dancing, often around Christmas time. Bands vary in size but are commonly made up of between two and six players. The appeal of the Scottish is by no means limited to the younger generation, and dances vary in speed and complexity to accommodate most age groups and levels of ability. Most private schools in Scotland will also hold on a fairly regular basis.

Public are also held, attracting paying participants, often held at dance clubs; and the annual Ceilidh Culture festival in Edinburgh.

Universities in Scotland hold regular , with the University of Edinburgh providing a number for students throughout each term, especially the long-running Highland Annual, the oldest in Edinburgh and the largest in Scotland, organised by the Highland Society (). Glasgow University Union&#x27;s annual debating competition, Glasgow Ancients, traditionally ends the night with a . The union&#x27;s Christmas event, Daft Friday, also involves a . are common fundraising and social events for many societies at the University of Glasgow.

Some bands intersperse dancing with a DJ playing disco music to broaden the appeal of the evening&#x27;s entertainment.

===In Ireland===


 dances (, ) or true dances () are a popular form of folk dancing in Ireland and are part of the broader Irish dances. The Irish dances are based on &quot;heys&quot; (&quot;hedges&quot;, or pairs of facing lines), round dances, long dances, and quadrilles, generally revived during the Gaelic revival in the first quarter of the twentieth century and codified by the Irish Dancing Commission. There are about thirty dances that form the basis for examination of dance teachers. Irish is a participatory social event attended by both men and women and accompanied by live Irish traditional music. The dance emerged within cultural nationalist consciousness as during the late 19th and early 20th century traditions promoting nationalist agendas, and national identities were regarded as not culturally unified.

====History and background====
Irish regained its popularity in the late 19th century, when Ireland made efforts to regain its cultural and political autonomy after being colonized for more than 800 years. The goal of the Gaelic League established in 1893 was to promote Irish cultural independence and de-anglicisation, which involved the remergent popularization of the Irish language, literature, and vernacular traditions, such as Irish singing and dancing. Plentiful branches of the Gaelic League giving dance, singing, music, and literature classes were established across Ireland.

====Dance form and style====
The style of dance employed for dance differs greatly from that used for set dance, and has more the appearance associated with the style of step dance. In particular, it emphasizes height and extension, with dancers generally dancing on their toes (but not as in ballet).
A movement called &quot;side-step&quot; or &quot;sevens and threes&quot; with which dancers travel sideways to the direction they are facing is common, as are jig-step movements called the &quot;rising step&quot; or &quot;grinding step&quot;. dances may be divided into figures, but a single type of tune is generally used for all the figures and the dancing does not pause between the figures.

Unlike square dance and round dance, dances are generally not called by a caller; the flow of dance is defined by its name.

==== Social ceili dances ====
 dances when performed socially are often performed in a progressive style. At the end of one whole iteration of the dance (lead around and body), instead of stopping, the groups move on to the next set of partners in the line. dances that can be performed progressively are: walls of Limerick, siege of Ennis, haymaker&#x27;s jig, and fairy reel. When there is a large social gathering, there will often be a caller for the dance, though it is a very different style from square-dancing caller. A caller is usually the teacher or most experienced dancer of the group who has the dance memorized. They then call the movements out in a non-stylized way, intended to remind those who are non-dancers when and where to move. Social dances are often the easiest dances and very easy to shuffle through as a non-dancer. A caller makes sure that everyone at a social dance can participate. Embellishments are accepted and fun in social dances, women adding spins or changing the style of a swing based on the skill of a partner.


===Similar gatherings in England===

&quot;Cèilidh&quot; in England has evolved a little differently from its counterparts in Scotland and Ireland. English &quot;cèilidh&quot;, usually called ceilidh, without the e-grave but pronounced as it is in Scottish Gaelic, can be considered part of English country dance (and related to contra dance). English ceilidh has many things in common with the Scottish and Irish social dance traditions. The dance figures are similar using couples&#x27; dances, square sets, long sets, and circle dances. However, the English style requires a slower tempo of tune accentuating the on-beat, the central instrument often being the English melodeon, a diatonic accordion in the keys of D and G. Dancers often use a skip, a step-hop or rant step depending on region. This contrasts with the smoother style and more fluid motion seen in Ireland, Scotland, or (the walking) in contra. Many ceilidh dances involve a couple, but this does not limit the number of partners any one dancer has during the ceilidh. Often dancers will change partners every dance to meet new people.

An important part of English ceilidhs is the &quot;caller&quot; who instructs the dancer in the next dance. An experienced ceilidh caller will have a good understanding of the mechanics of the tunes and a deep knowledge of regional dances from the UK and beyond. They will confer with the band about what type of tune to play for the dance. This aids the selection of the right dance for the right audience, and is a skill is so sought after in the south of England that there are callers who are famous in their own right. However, many bands have their own caller, often also an instrumentalist; some have two.

During an English ceilidh there is often an interval involving the talents of local Morris or rapper side; this also serves to give bands with older members a rest.

It is possible to see many diverse and regionally distinct acts at a modern English ceilidh. Acts range from the most traditional, like the Old Swan Band, to the most experimental like the electronic dance music-influenced Monster Ceilidh Band. Many other forms of music have been combined with English ceilidh music including; Irish music from the band Phoenix Ceilidh Band; ska from the band Whapweasel; traditional jazz from the bands Chalktown and Florida; funk fusion from Licence to Ceilidh, Ceilidhography, and Climax Ceilidh Band, rock from the bands Peeping Tom, Aardvark Ceilidh Band, Touchstone, and Tickled Pink; West African- and Indian-influenced music from the band Boka Halattraditional; traditional French music from the band Token Women; traditional Welsh music from Twm Twp; and heavy metal from Glorystrokes.

<text>Kilmarnock Football Club, commonly known as Killie, is a Scottish professional football team based in the town of Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire. The team is currently managed by Derek McInnes, who was appointed in January 2022. The club has achieved several honours since its formation in 1869, most recently the 2011–12 Scottish League Cup after a 1–0 win over Celtic at Hampden Park and the Scottish Championship title in 2022. The club nickname, &quot;Killie&quot;, is the Scottish term for the town of Kilmarnock.

The club have qualified for European competitions on nine occasions, their best performance coming in the 1966–67 Fairs Cup when they progressed to the semi-finals, eventually being eliminated by Leeds United. The club is also one of only a few Scottish clubs to have played in three European competitions (European Cup, Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the UEFA Cup). Additionally, the club have played in the International Soccer League four times – 1960, 1961, 1963 and 1965, as well as competing in the 1995 Korea Cup. Their most recent appearance in European competition football was during the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League and 2024–25 UEFA Conference League.

Kilmarnock Football Club is currently the oldest football club in the Scottish Premiership, and also the second-oldest professional club in Scotland. Home matches are played at Rugby Park, a 15,003 capacity all-seater stadium situated in the town itself. Kilmarnock took part in the first-ever official match in the Scottish Cup against the now-defunct Renton in 1873. With a long-standing football rivalry with fellow Ayrshire side Ayr United, both teams play frequently in the Ayrshire derby, first meeting in September 1910.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The club&#x27;s foundation dates back to the very earliest days of organised football in Scotland, with speculation over the club&#x27;s beginnings being in 1868, 1869 or 1872 often disputed. The club was founded by a collection of men and boys who were sporting enthusiasts, with a few of them playing cricket during the summer months, as well as playing bowls, quiots, running and golf. During the winter period, the group lacked active sporting opportunities, and in the Autumn of 1868, the younger members of the sporting enthusiasts who attended Kilmarnock Academy first played football in the Barbadoes Green area of Kilmarnock. Football in Scotland at this time was considered &quot;rough&quot; and &quot;disorderly&quot;, and, while it was popular, it had never been played in an organised manner before. The group of sporting enthusiasts later became known as the club&#x27;s &quot;founding fathers&quot;, and began playing football with their own set of rules which were more similar to that of Rugby league, rather than association rules, which had become the rules used for a similar game, also known as football, in England in the late 1850s. A committee was formed with the intention of the game becoming more organised, and after raising money, had placed an advertisement in the 2 January 1869 issue of the &quot;Kilmarnock Standard&quot; for a general meeting of the &quot;Kilmarnock Foot-ball Club&quot; to be held in Robertson&#x27;s Temperance Hotel on Portland Road in Kilmarnock on Tuesday 5 January 1869. The advert read: &quot;Parties wishing to become members may do so at the meeting, or at the Secretary&#x27;s, 55 King Street&quot;. No official recorded minutes or outcomes of the meeting are known to have existed.

With no recorded minutes of the meeting having taken place in January 1869, it is assumed that the members continued to play amongst themselves and with their own set of rugby-inspired rules. On 25 October 1872, a meeting was held by the committee at the George Hotel, Kilmarnock. Recorded minutes from the meeting highlighted that interest in the game had increased as had the membership, leading to the decision being made to officially constitute the club as &quot;Kilmarnock Football Club&quot;, with a set of rules to play the game of football properly to be purchased, as no other clubs were playing &quot;football&quot; in the same style that the club had been playing up until that point. A meeting held by the committee on 29 October 1872 saw the agreement between the club and a gentleman, Mr. Wright, to rent his field nearby for £3, which they did until March 1873. A game was agreed to be played on the field on 2 November 1872, but no result or opponent to Kilmarnock Football Club were ever recorded. In November 1872, the club decided to formally adopt the rugby union rules they had purchased for use in the game. On 7 December 1872, Kilmarnock Football Club played their first known competitive game using the rugby union rules. The game was an 11-a-side game against Kilmarnock Cricket Club Xl which ended in a 0–0 draw.

During a club meeting on 3 March 1873, a letter from Queen&#x27;s Park asked Kilmarnock F.C. if they were interested in attending a meeting at the Dewar Hotel in Glasgow on 13 March 1873 to discuss the formation of a Scottish Football Association playing to football association rules, with the possibility of purchasing a cup for the winner of a knock out competition to take place later in 1873. Kilmarnock had long previously turned Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s requests down in the past, however, a favourable letter was returned to the team, informing the club that Kilmarnock were unable to send a representative to the meeting in Glasgow on 13 March 1873 due to having a committee meeting on the scheduled date, but advised that they were willing to join the Scottish Football Association, pledging to pay the 5 shillings membership fee and donate £1 towards the purchase of a cup for the knock-out competition. The first game played by Kilmarnock under football association rules was in the 1873–74 season. The club suffered a drastic decline in membership numbers following a fall out with their landlord at Holm Quarry, after the club wished to move back to Dundonald Road. Kilmarnock Football Club were one of the founding members of the Ayrshire Football Association which formed in May 1877. By the 1880s, Kilmarnock Football Club had established themselves as the premier club in Ayrshire.

The club had not been considered eligible for the Scottish Football League when it was formed in 1890, nor was it deemed eligible to be included in a second division. Kilmarnock Football Club was finally elected to the Scottish League in 1895, and finished their first season in the Scottish League in fourth place out of ten teams. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time, beating Albion Rovers at Hampden Park. This was followed by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites Rangers 2–0 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people. They soon reached another final against the same opposition in 1932 but this time were beaten after a replay, and the same outcome followed in the 1938 final against East Fife, Killie this time the team on the receiving end of an upset.

===North American and European tournaments===

After finishing as runners-up during the 1959–60 season, Kilmarnock could have been put forward as one of Scotland&#x27;s entrants for the following season&#x27;s European Fairs Cup. Instead, the Scottish Football Association sent the team to North America to play in the International Soccer League, serving as Scotland&#x27;s representative. Kilmarnock remained unbeaten during their group matches in both New York and Jersey City, with wins over Bayern Munich and English league champions, Burnley. Kilmarnock returned to North America to play in the International Soccer League final, losing 2–0 to Brazilian club Bangu Atlético Clube.

During the 1960–61 season, Kilmarnock reached the Scottish League Cup final for the second time, where they lost to Rangers 2–0 and finished as the season&#x27;s runners-up. After years of being sidelined by the Scottish Football Association, Kilmarnock were put forward for the 1964–65 European Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing their first match. The team made it to the second round, losing to Everton 1–4 and exiting the competition.

===Scottish League Champions===

Kilmarnock performed strong during the 1964–65 season, winning their first six matches in the season and remaining unbeaten in the league until December 1964. In 1964–65 Heart of Midlothian fought out a championship title race with Willie Waddell&#x27;s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with Dundee United meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. 

They also had a solid pedigree of trophy-winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell&#x27;s Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts&#x27; triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts&#x27; Roald Jensen hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through Davie Sneddon and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. Alan Gordon had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a Bobby Ferguson diving save pushing the ball past the post. The 2–0 defeat meant Hearts lost the title by an average of 0.042 goals. Subsequently, Hearts were instrumental in pushing through a change to use goal difference to separate teams level on points. Ironically this rule change later denied Hearts the title in 1985–86. This is the only time to date Killie have been Scottish champions.

===Korean Cup and Scottish Cup victory===

Decline in the 1980s brought relegation to the Second Division, returning to the top division with promotion in 1993. In the summer of 1995, Kilmarnock were invited to South Korea to play in the Korea Cup. Kilmarnock played the Costa Rica national football team, finishing the game with a draw between both teams.

By the commencement of the 1996–97 season, optimism within the club remained low, with little to suggest that the season would see Kilmarnock win the Scottish Cup again, having previously done so 68 years prior. With inconsistent league results, and a home defeat to Raith Rovers in December 1996, Bobby Williamson became the new manager of Kilmarnock and began introducing new players to the team. Players such as David Bagan and Alex Burke were credited with improving the team&#x27;s performance, along with Williamson&#x27;s managerial style and approach. With relegation still a possibility, Kilmarnock climbed out of the relegation zone following a 1–1 home draw in the final league match of the season between Aberdeen. During the same period, Kilmarnock had been making good progress in the Scottish Cup, progressing to the 1997 Scottish Cup final with Falkirk held at Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow on 24 May 1997. 25,000 Kilmarnock fans attended with final, with Paul Wright scoring for Kilmarnock, allowing for Kilmarnock to claim the Scottish Cup for the third time. Following their Scottish Cup victory, the team travelled back to Kilmarnock from Glasgow on an open topped bus, travelling up the town&#x27;s John Finnie Street where they were met with a barrage of fans celebrating their victory.

Victory in the Scottish Cup secured a place for Kilmarnock in the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, meaning a return to European football for the club following an absence of 27 years.

===21st century===

====UEFA Cup====

In the 2001–02 UEFA Cup, Kilmarnock travelled to Lurgan in Northern Ireland to play Glenavon, winning 1–0 following a goal by Chris Innes. In the return leg at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock won 1–0 following a goal from Ally Mitchell. In their next match, Kilmarnock faced Norwegian club Viking FK, securing a 1–1 draw at Rugby Park before suffering a 0–2 loss away from home and exiting the UEFA Cup. Kilmarnock won the Scottish Youth Cup in 2004, following a 1–0 victory over Rangers which was held at Rugby Park due to Hampden Park being unavailable to host the final.

====2007 and 2012 Scottish League Cup finals====

Kilmarnock reached the 2007 Scottish League Cup final, but suffered a 5–1 defeat in the final by Hibernian. After selling Steven Naismith to Rangers for a club-record fee in August 2007, &quot;Killie&quot; struggled in the 2007–08 Scottish Premier League, finishing in 11th place with 40 points. In January 2010, Kilmarnock were second bottom of the 2009–10 Scottish Premier League, with last placed Falkirk just two points behind. On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by &quot;mutual consent&quot; and Jimmy Calderwood was appointed manager. Kilmarnock then achieved a first win in nine years against Celtic. Continued poor form, however, meant a final day showdown at Rugby Park with Falkirk for SPL survival. Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year. They ended the season with just 33 points, their worst points finish in the SPL.

After Calderwood left at the end of the season, Mixu Paatelainen was appointed manager for the next two years with an option for a third. Despite being the favourites for relegation that season, Kilmarnock finished the season in fifth position. Paatelainen left the club to become manager of Finland and his assistant Kenny Shiels was appointed manager. Kilmarnock progressed to the 2012 Scottish League Cup final with wins against Queen of the South, East Fife and Ayr United in an Ayrshire derby at Hampden. Kilmarnock won the League Cup for the first time, as they defeated Celtic 1–0 in the final; Dieter Van Tornhout scored the only goal six minutes from time, with goalkeeper Cammy Bell named Man of the Match. In June 2013, after three years at Kilmarnock, manager Kenny Shiels was sacked by chairman Michael Johnston after a &quot;mutual agreement&quot; between the two.

====Manager changes====

Allan Johnston signed a two-year contract and was appointed manager on 24 June 2013, with Sandy Clark as the assistant manager. Clark left his role in the summer of 2014 with the club looking to go in a new direction, and ex-Killie player and former Hearts manager Gary Locke was appointed as his assistant. Johnston was sacked in February 2015 after informing the press of his intention to leave in the summer, before discussing this with the board. Locke was placed in interim charge, before signing a three-year deal in April 2015. Kilmarnock went on to lose seven of their final eight games of the season, but were spared the play-off spot after a 4–1 win over Partick Thistle.

The 2015–16 season would prove difficult for the team. Locke was removed from his position as manager in February 2016, with Lee Clark being appointed as his replacement. Despite a small uplift in form, the team finished in 11th place and faced a relegation play-off against Championship side Falkirk in order to stay in the top flight. Despite losing 0–1 in the first leg, &quot;Killie&quot; fought back and comfortably won the second leg 4–0 (4–1 on aggregate), securing the club&#x27;s status in the Scottish Premiership for another season. Clark would leave Kilmarnock for a return to England with Bury in February 2017, exactly a year after his arrival. Former Rangers player Lee McCulloch, assistant to both Locke and Clark, was placed in temporary charge until the end of the season, achieving an eighth-place finish. The following season saw another poor start, with an early defeat to rivals Ayr United in the league cup group stages, followed by a disappointing start to the league campaign. McCulloch was sacked in September 2017 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table.

====The Clarke era====
In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former Chelsea and West Bromwich Albion coach Steve Clarke. It was Clarke&#x27;s first involvement with the Scottish game in 30 years and his appointment preempted a dramatic upturn in form, with the club ultimately finishing in fifth place, earning him the SFWA Manager of the Year award in the process. The 2018–19 season saw Kilmarnock celebrate their 150th anniversary, and the team continued their strong form in the league, both home and away, culminating in a final day fixture against Rangers at Rugby Park. Kilmarnock won the match 2–1 and the result secured a third-place finish in the league, which guaranteed European football for the first time since 2001. The season&#x27;s results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the Scottish Football Association to become the head coach of the Scotland national team.

Following the departure of Steve Clarke, Kilmarnock had three managers whose spell in charge was brief, beginning with former Juventus and Chelsea assistant coach Angelo Alessio. In Alessio&#x27;s second match in charge, Kilmarnock lost in Europa League qualification to Welsh Premier League club Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads. Alessio was sacked in December 2019, with the team sitting in fifth place. Following his departure, Alex Dyer, assistant coach to both Alessio and Clarke, was appointed on an initial caretaker basis until the end of the season, before all football was abruptly ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dyer&#x27;s services were retained by the club and he signed a new contract extension in June 2020. However, following a poor start to the new season, he left the club by mutual consent in January 2021. In February 2021, former St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright was appointed as the club&#x27;s third manager in two years.

====Relegation and Championship winners====

On 24 May 2021, following a play−off defeat to Dundee, Kilmarnock were relegated to the Scottish Championship, bringing an end to their 28-year stay in the top flight. Their 11th-place finish and play-off defeat in 2020–21 meant it was the club&#x27;s first season in the Championship, and their first in the second tier of Scottish football since 1992–93. Manager Tommy Wright made 14 permanent summer signings as he approached his first full season as Kilmarnock manager, before being sacked in December 2021 with the team sitting fifth place in the Championship. Former Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes was quickly appointed as his successor. Results improved, and by the end of the 2021–22 season, Kilmarnock were promoted back to the top flight of Scottish football at the first attempt, defeating closest challengers Arbroath 2–1 on the penultimate matchday with a dramatic last-minute winner from Blair Alston.

In cup competition during the season, Kilmarnock were eliminated in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup, in the second round of the League Cup and the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup.

===Return to Premiership===
Following their first-place finish in the Scottish Championship in 2021–22, Kilmarnock returned to the Scottish Premiership after spending one year in the second tier. At the conclusion of the season, Kilmarnock finished 10th in the Premiership table out of 12 teams, as well as reaching the quarter finals of the Scottish Cup and the semi-final of the 2022–23 Scottish League Cup.

Kilmarnock competed in the 2023–24 Scottish League Cup, ultimately reaching the quarter final stage. They were knocked out of the competition following a 2–1 defeat to Heart of Midlothian.

====2024–25 Europa and Conference League campaign====

After finishing the 2023–24 Scottish Premiership in fourth place, Kilmarnock F.C. secured qualification for the . Their first game, against Belgian team Cercle Brugge at Rugby Park on 25 July 2024, ended in a 1–1 draw with David Watson scoring for Kilmarnock in the 70th minute. On 1 August 2024, Kilmarnock played Cercle Brugge at Jan Breydelstadion in Belgium, losing to the hosts 1–0.

Following their exit from the Europa League after losing 2–1 aggregate defeat to Cercle Brugge, the team dropped to the UEFA Conference League. Their first match of the Conference League took place at Rugby Park on 8 August 2024 against Norwegian team Tromsø, which ended 2–2, with Kyle Vassell and Bobby Wales scoring for Kilmarnock in the 6th and 90th minute respectively. On 15 August 2024, Kilmarnock secured a UEFA Conference League play–off spot following a 1–0 victory in the return leg. On 22 August 2024, Kilmarnock travelled to Copenhagen, losing 2–0. Kilmarnock F.C. exited the Conference League on 29 August 2024, following a 1–1 draw to Copenhagen. Kilmarnock were first to score, with a Marley Watkins goal in the 16th minute, followed by an own goal by Lewis Mayo in the 68th minute.

==Ayrshire Derby==


Kilmarnock&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with their South Ayrshire neighbours, Ayr United, and together they contest the Ayrshire derby. Between national competitions such as the Scottish Football League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Challenge Cup, Kilmarnock have beaten Ayr United a total of 59 times, whilst beating Ayr United 43 times in defunct competitions such as the Ayrshire Cup, Ayrshire League, Ayr Charity Cup, Kilmarnock Charity Cup and the West Sound Trophy.

On 28 January 2012, Ayr United and Kilmarnock met at Hampden Park for the League Cup semi-final. Kilmarnock won 1–0 thanks to a 109th-minute goal from Dean Shiels. This was the first time that the Ayrshire derby had taken place in the semi-finals of a major competition and it was also the first derby to be played at a neutral venue. The game also achieved the highest recorded post-World War II crowd of any Ayrshire derby with 25,057 people travelling to Hampden (Kilmarnock versus Ayr United on 19 March 1938 had a crowd of 27,442).

The Ayrshire Derby fixture was revived in season 2021–22, as both clubs were in the same division following Kilmarnock&#x27;s relegation to the Scottish Championship.

==Club operations==
===Ownership and finances===
Since June 1906, Kilmarnock F.C. has been owned by the private limited company, The Kilmarnock Football Club Ltd. Since 2014, the majority shareholder of the club is Ayrshire businessman Billy Bowie, who oversees all operations of the club. Kilmarnock became debt-free under Bowie&#x27;s control in 2017 after several years of financial difficulty.

In May 2018 Kilmarnock made a landmark move by appointing Phyllis McLeish, commercial director of the QTS Group, to the club&#x27;s board; in doing so she became the first female board member in over 20 years. Later that same month, the club appointed its second female board member in Cathy Jamieson, former MP for the Kilmarnock and Loudoun district and a life-long Killie fan. Her appointment came after being nominated by The Killie Trust Initiative, who raised over £100,000 to have a member of the trust on the board.

===Colours and badge===

The earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all-blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as &quot;a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm&quot; (an adoption of the historic Clan Boyd chief&#x27;s heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887 and 1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley who, at the time, was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club&#x27;s away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club&#x27;s main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.

Between 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erreá was the manufacturer. Kilmarnock kits were manufactured by American company Nike between 2016 and 2020. The current kit manufacturer is Danish company Hummel; it can only be bought from the store at Rugby Park.

The club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club&#x27;s Latin motto, &quot;confidemus&quot; (we trust), is written above the badge (similar to the Clan Boyd heraldic motto, &quot;confido&quot; (I trust)). The club adopted the badge in 1992 after The Lord Lyon decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish heraldic rules.

In October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary.










===Club mascot===
The club&#x27;s mascot is a squirrel named &#x27;Captain Conker&#x27;, named after the squirrels which feature on the club&#x27;s crest and the coat of arms of the Clan Boyd of Kilmarnock. In the past, the &#x27;Killie Pie&#x27; mascot was also a regular at Rugby Park on matchdays. Previously, the mascot was Nutz the squirrel, played by long-time Kilmarnock fan Ian Downie who died in 2020. Downie had played the club&#x27;s mascot for 19 years prior to his death.

===Stadium===
Kilmarnock first played football matches at the present Rugby Park site in 1899. Despite this, the venue is actually Kilmarnock&#x27;s fourth home ground. The Grange, Holm Quarry and Ward&#x27;s Park all hosted matches before the club moved to Rugby Park in 1877. This was not the present stadium, but one situated close by near South Hamilton Street. This ground was shared by cricket and rugby teams – sports which Kilmarnock had played previously – and the connection with rugby gave the ground its name. This name was taken with the club when they moved to their present stadium.

During the 1994–95 season the stadium capacity was significantly reduced as three new stands were constructed; the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to . The stadium opened on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English champions Blackburn Rovers. Mike Newell hit a hat-trick as the home team lost 5–0.

A FIFA 2 star FieldTurf artificial pitch was installed at Rugby Park for the start of the 2014–15 season. The pitch is capable of hosting rugby matches as well as football. A new artificial hybrid surface was installed during the 2019 close season. In February 2019 Kilmarnock received approval to install a new safe-standing section in areas of the East and Moffat stands. The installation process was completed in early December of that year.

In December 2022 Kilmarnock announced that consultation had begun on the plans to develop &#x27;Bowie Park Training Facility&#x27; with a view to creating a dedicated club training ground where Kilmarnock&#x27;s men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and academy teams can develop within the same purpose-built environment. Funded by Billy Bowie, the proposal includes the creation of two five-a-side and two full-size pitches – one with an accompanying 500-seat stand – alongside a two-floor training facility building which features a gym, changing rooms, canteen / seminar room, offices and a players’ lounge.

===Club anthem===
The song &quot;Paper Roses&quot;, originally a hit by American singer and activist Anita Bryant, was adopted by Kilmarnock fans as their own club anthem. American singer and actress Marie Osmond, who is famous for recording this song, surprised the fans in February 2013 and performed at Rugby Park along with a meet and greet session, signing autographs for the players and fans.

<doc id="405665" wikidata="Q933524" url="?curid=405665" title="Pilotwings 64">
<text>is a 1996 flight simulation video game developed by Nintendo and Paradigm Simulation and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was one of three launch titles for the Nintendo 64 in Japan as well as Europe and one of two launch titles in North America, along with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Pilotwings&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which was a North American launch game for its respective console in 1991. Also like that game, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; received production input from Nintendo producer and EAD General Manager Shigeru Miyamoto.

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; puts the player in control of one of six pilots as they try to earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events are flying an autogyro, using a jet pack, and hang gliding. Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.

The game received positive review scores and praise from gaming publications and news sources alike for its visual presentation and flying controls. Similar to its SNES predecessor, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; serves to demonstrate the graphical capabilities of its gaming hardware. Although the flight simulator did not enjoy the same commercial success as its fellow launch game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; nonetheless went on to sell over one million copies worldwide. The game received its first official re-release on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on October 13, 2022.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; is a flight simulator in which the player must complete a variety of missions involving different airborne vehicles and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight. Tests before each event require the player to complete an objective in order to earn a license for the event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, softness of landing, and similar criteria. The player is awarded a bronze, silver, or gold license based on the number of points attained. More difficult tests become available as the player progresses.

There are three main events in &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; required to complete the game, each of which has its own objectives and unique flight controls using the Nintendo 64 controller&#x27;s single analog stick. The first, hang gliding, usually requires the player to fly through a series of floating marker rings or snap a photograph of a particular piece of scenery before landing on a target area. The player&#x27;s movement is affected by wind currents, and altitude can be gained by flying through thermal columns. The second event is the &quot;Rocket Belt&quot;, a jet pack that allows the player to move and gain height as well as hover, tilt, and rotate in the air using the belt&#x27;s equipped thrusters. Goals entail flying through rings, landing on floating platforms or popping large balloons before landing. The third event, the gyrocopter, challenges the player to take off and land on a runway after completing objectives like navigating a path of rings or destroying targets with missiles.

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; also features several bonus events that are unlocked if the player performs well in the main missions. The player can also earn medals in many of these events. They include skydiving, a human cannonball event, and the &quot;Jumble Hopper&quot;, which grants the player special spring-loaded boots use in bouncing across the landscape to an end space. Lastly, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; features a &quot;Birdman&quot; mode that puts the character in a bird suit and gives players the opportunity to freely explore the game&#x27;s detailed, object-dense environments set among its four distinct islands. One of the islands is based on the United States, and has geographical replications of famous landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore (with Mario&#x27;s face replacing George Washington&#x27;s) and major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City. Representations of Nintendo characters and many other quirks can be found in the landscapes of the game.

==Development==
&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was co-developed by the Texas-based graphics company Paradigm Simulation and Nintendo&#x27;s Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development (EAD) and Research and Development No. 3 (R&amp;D3) divisions. Due to Paradigm&#x27;s experience with Silicon Graphics workstations, Nintendo contacted the American company in 1994 concerning it becoming one of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot; of first developers. Paradigm worked directly with a team at Silicon Graphics and spent nine months developing a technology base for &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; and Paradigm&#x27;s other Nintendo 64 releases. Development on &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; began in earnest during June 1995, with Nintendo working on the game design and Paradigm working on the technical production. Nintendo&#x27;s Genyo Takeda and Makoto Wada acted as Paradigm&#x27;s primary technical and design contacts individually. Wada, the game&#x27;s director, was also involved in design aspects such as modeling and animation. Shigeru Miyamoto, the producer of &quot;Pilotwings&quot; for the SNES, reprised his role for &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; and oversaw the project from Japan. Miyamoto&#x27;s involvement was more removed than with the SNES game due to his simultaneous work on the platform game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

According to Miyamoto, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was designed to allow gamers to experience free flight in realistic 3D environments on the Nintendo 64. Prior to the game&#x27;s conception, Paradigm had worked on military vehicle and flight simulators, but not video games. Dave Gatchel of Paradigm disclosed that with regard to creating the game, they began with a &quot;physics-based approach&quot;, but deviated from this in order to gain a balance between accuracy and fun for players. He indicated that there was never an issue as to whether &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; should be more of an arcade game or a simulation, as their goal was to &quot;always have a more arcade feel&quot;. The technical team studied the original &quot;Pilotwings&quot; extensively during development.

&quot;Pilotwings&quot; on the SNES makes use of the power of the 16-bit console, principally its Mode 7 capability. Similarly, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; prominently demonstrates the graphical features of its own console. Gatchel suggested that just as design elements present in the game generated its production requirements, these same elements were influenced by the Nintendo 64&#x27;s technology during development. The large islands within the game were created using Paradigm&#x27;s own 3D development tool Vega UltraVision. Navigation of these environments is relatively smooth thanks to &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; taking advantage of several key Nintendo 64 hardware features. Conventional level of detail and mipmapping were used to reduce the computational load of distant landscape objects and terrains when they were rendered. The processes respectively substitute simpler geometrical shapes for more complex ones and less detailed textures for more detailed ones, lowering the polygon count and 3D rendering time for a given frame and thus putting less demand on the geometric engine. &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; also applies z-buffering, which keeps track of an object&#x27;s depth and tells the graphics processor which portions of the object to render and which to hide. This, along with texture filtering and anti-aliasing, makes the object appear solid and smooth along its edges rather than pixelated.

As Nintendo was in charge of its actual game design, they dictated the aircraft and characters that would be present in the game. The six playable pilots in &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; are all named after various birds. The character Lark is modeled after Nester, a mascot for the North American &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine. The female character Robin is called &quot;Hooter&quot; in the Japanese version. The soundtrack for &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was composed by Dan Hess with Akito Nakatsuka as arranger. According to Hess, Nakatsuka did not participate in the making of the game&#x27;s music despite his credit. The tracks were produced to complement each level, such as a &quot;soothing&quot; jazz-inspired musical piece played during the exploratory Birdman mode. A CD soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon in Japan on December 16, 1996.

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was one of thirteen Nintendo 64 games shown at Shoshinkai show in Tokyo in November 1995 when the console was first demonstrated to the public as the &quot;Ultra 64&quot;. The game was later displayed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles during May 1996.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was released in Japan on June 23, 1996, as one of three Nintendo 64 launch titles, the other two being &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Saikyō Habu Shōgi&quot;. &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; managed to sell about one unit with about every tenth Nintendo 64 console, with regional sales totaling 136,986 copies by the end of the year. The game was one of two original releases for the system during its September 26, 1996 debut in North America, which was a few days earlier than the date set by Nintendo. While &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; initially sold at a one-to-one ratio with each console in the United States, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; sold an average of one copy with every fourth console. Despite selling out, some store locations for Electronics Boutique and KB Toys reported little or no units of the flight simulator being shipped to retailers. About 90,000 copies of &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; were sold in its first few days on sale in the country, putting the game at number four on the NPD Group sales charts for that September. It went on to become the sixth best-selling Nintendo 64 game of 1996 in the United States. &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; saw a release in European nations on March 1, 1997, when it was one of three launch games along with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it was listed by &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine as the &quot;cheapest game in Nintendo&#x27;s frighteningly-priced opening range of titles&quot;. It was confirmed in early 1998 that the game had sold over one million units worldwide.

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was well received by most reviewers. The game&#x27;s combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release review of the Nintendo 64, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; make it one of the most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, &quot;The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; one hell of a great ride.&quot; Staff reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game&#x27;s polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s large environments, exclaiming, &quot;You&#x27;ll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it&#x27;ll take you months to see everything.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, &quot;challenge without competition&quot; aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as &quot;Nintendogs&quot;. Rich Leadbetter of &quot;Maximum&quot; said that not everyone is appealed by its gameplay&#x27;s &quot;sedate nature&quot;, but agreed that &quot;PilotWings 64&quot; involved high &quot;skill, dexterity and control&quot;, and that &quot;it is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of &#x27;must-have&#x27;itude as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo.&quot; A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo&#x27;s surrealistic gameplay: &quot;It&#x27;s a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don&#x27;t grate.&quot;

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; has been criticized for lacking innovative gameplay. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Ashley Dunn characterized the game&#x27;s E3 demonstration as &quot;brain-dead&quot; in its gameplay and suggested that even young children would rather fly a dragon on the Sony PlayStation. Game Revolution issued &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; a particularly harsh review score, declaring the game to be nothing more than a graphical showcase for those with nothing better to do. The sound effects present in the game were impressive to several reviewers, but the soundtrack has been negatively compared to lounge music and porn groove, although the &#x27;Birdman&#x27; track was highly rated.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; Flying Game of the Year, explaining that it shows the potential of the fun factor of flying and allows for more than one path from point A to point B, and says that &quot;fun, variety and easy-paced action gave PW64 this award.&quot;

&quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; was ranked number 38 in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; in its landmark 100th issue in September 1997. In February 2006, it was rated the 117th best game made on a Nintendo system in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Games&quot; list for its 200th issue. In July 2007, the United Kingdom video game magazine &quot;Edge&quot; included &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; at number 69 on its own &quot;Top 100 Games&quot; list. The UK&#x27;s &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; listed it at number 40 on its &quot;100 Best Nintendo Games&quot; in February 2009.

Paradigm announced at E3 1997 that they were producing a Nintendo 64 sequel to &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;. However, even though Nintendo expressed interest in Paradigm&#x27;s early presentations, the game was cancelled because Nintendo did not have the resources to aid in its development at that time. There were rumors of a sequel on the GameCube and later the Wii, development courtesy of Factor 5, but no game was ever shown. After their briefing time at E3 2010, Nintendo announced a sequel titled &quot;Pilotwings Resort&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, which was released as a launch title for the handheld console.

<text>Quintet is a 1979 American post-apocalyptic science fiction film directed by Robert Altman. It stars Paul Newman, Brigitte Fossey, Bibi Andersson, Fernando Rey, Vittorio Gassman and Nina Van Pallandt.

==Plot==
The story takes place during a new ice age. The camera tracks a blank, frozen, seemingly deserted tundra until two blurry, distant figures can just be made out. They are the seal hunter Essex and his pregnant companion, Vivia, the daughter of one of Essex&#x27;s late hunting partners. They are traveling north, where Essex hopes to reunite with his brother, Francha.

Essex and Vivia eventually find Francha&#x27;s apartment, but the reunion is short-lived. While Essex is out buying firewood, a gambler named Redstone throws a bomb into Francha&#x27;s apartment, killing everyone inside, including Vivia. Essex sees Redstone fleeing the scene and chases him to the sector&#x27;s &quot;Information Room&quot;. Essex witnesses the murder of Redstone by an Italian gambler named St. Christopher. When St. Christopher leaves, Essex searches Redstone&#x27;s pockets and finds a piece of paper with a list of names: Francha, Redstone, Goldstar, Deuca, St. Christopher, and Ambrosia.

Puzzled by the mystery, Essex discovers that Redstone had previously checked into the Hotel Electra, a gambling resort in another sector. He visits the hotel and assumes Redstone&#x27;s identity. Immediately after checking in, Essex is given an unexpected welcome by Grigor, who is the dealer in the casino. Insisting that he means no harm, Grigor invites Essex (as &quot;Redstone&quot;) to the casino, where gamblers are now heavily involved in a &quot;Quintet&quot; tournament. While there he meets Ambrosia, who always assumes the role of the &quot;sixth player&quot; in the game.

Essex is unaware that the current Quintet tournament is a fight for the survival of the fittest. Those who are &quot;killed&quot; in game are executed in real life. Grigor and St. Christopher are aware that Essex is not the real Redstone, so they ignore him and focus on the other players. Goldstar is the first killed, followed by Deuca, until the only two players left are St. Christopher and Ambrosia. Ambrosia, however, insists that Essex be counted as a player in the game since he has assumed Redstone&#x27;s identity. Grigor agrees and informs St. Christopher that he has to eliminate Essex before he can face off against Ambrosia.

Essex and St. Christopher have a showdown outside the city, where St. Christopher is killed by falling into a rupture of the ice sheet. Essex returns to Francha&#x27;s apartment and finds the same list that Redstone had. Ambrosia follows Essex to the apartment. Essex slits her throat moments before her attempt to slit his throat.

Returning to the Hotel Electra to cremate Ambrosia&#x27;s body, Essex confronts Grigor to demand his &quot;prize&quot;, since he was the winner of Quintet. Grigor reveals that the only prize is the thrill of the game itself. Grigor insists he stay and participate in future tournaments, but a disgusted Essex condemns Quintet and leaves the hotel for good. The film ends with Essex taking a long walk out into the barren distance.

==Production==
Robert Altman came up with the original idea but said he wanted Walter Hill to write and direct the film. He also brought up the idea to author/director Lionel Chetwynd of a dream he had involving a fantastical game of chance involving a quintet of people and not only envisioned making a board game of it but also a film provided that Chetwynd write a novella to serve as the basis to adapt. Disagreements in the draft process led to this falling through, which eventually led to writers such as Patricia Resnick being brought in for suggestions; she bowed out early in favor of not wanting to be present during filming in the cold along with pursuing another opportunity. Frank Barhydt was then brought in to do work with Altman.
&quot;Quintet&quot; was filmed in early 1978 on the site of Montreal&#x27;s Expo 67 world&#x27;s fair. The extreme cold made the shoot challenging for the cast and crew. The soundtrack was recorded by the New York Philharmonic.

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, 20th Century Fox president Alan Ladd Jr. told &quot;Variety&quot; that Altman was not given final cut on what he termed &quot;a complicated picture&quot;.

==Reception==
According to a report in &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, the film was &quot;a financial disaster&quot;.

Reviews were mostly negative. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, calling it &quot;a puzzlement, and not a very interesting one&quot;. Gene Siskel awarded one-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, &quot;These are metaphors that college filmmakers wouldn&#x27;t consider making into movies, but Altman somehow considers this profound. Actually, his script is derivative of the Italian comedy &quot;The Tenth Victim&quot; and Harlan Ellison&#x27;s sci-fi parable &quot;A Boy and His Dog.&quot;&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;Robert Altman&#x27;s latest impenetrable exercise in self-indulgence&quot;.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described Quintet as &quot;paralyzingly stupid: stupefied with a mumbling guttural prententiousness&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Quintet&quot; is depressing not because it&#x27;s about the end of the world, but because its artistic vision is feeble. Yet it&#x27;s the work of one of the most original, vital, enterprising directors of our time. How to reconcile these facts? I&#x27;m not sure they can be.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared, &quot;Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Quintet,&quot; now at area theaters, earns a little five-sided niche next to &quot;Zardoz&quot; and &quot;The Heretic&quot; in the &#x27;70s memory album of pseudo-profound fiascoes.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; lamented that Altman was &quot;giving weight to scenes that he would have treated as comedy skits only a few years ago ... with dialogue such as the diabolical Gassman&#x27;s &#x27;Hope is an obsolete word,&#x27; contrasted with the inspirational music as Newman presses on northward, it&#x27;s like a Monty Python show played at the wrong speed.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, however, wrote in a positive review: &quot;It invites easy charges that it is self-indulgent and pretentious. Yet I am bound to say that I was fascinated by it. Like it or not, it is a true tour de force of film-making, an exercise in tone and atmosphere sustained from start to finish.&quot;

Jack Kroll wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s clear that the game of &quot;Quintet&quot; is Altman&#x27;s metaphor for the erosion of art, philosophy and the humane activities of civilization. That&#x27;s one of the weaknesses of the film - the game itself can&#x27;t bear this symbolic weight ... But this is transcended by the strong acting and by the great beauty and hypnotic rhythm of the film.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 27% based on 11 reviews.

<text>The German National People&#x27;s Party (, DNVP) was a national-conservative and monarchist political party in Germany during the Weimar Republic. Before the rise of the Nazi Party, it was the major nationalist party in Weimar Germany. It was an alliance of conservative, nationalist, monarchist, , and antisemitic elements supported by the Pan-German League. Ideologically, the party was described as subscribing to authoritarian conservatism, German nationalism, monarchism, and from 1931 onwards also to corporatism in economic policy. It held anti-communist, anti-Catholic, and antisemitic views. On the left–right political spectrum, it belonged on the right-wing, and is classified as far-right in its early years and then again from the late 1920s when it moved back rightward. It has also been described as proto-fascist.

It was formed in late 1918 after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919 that toppled the German Empire and the monarchy. It combined the bulk of the German Conservative Party, Free Conservative Party, and German Fatherland Party, with right-wing elements of the National Liberal Party. The party strongly rejected the republican Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Treaty of Versailles, which it viewed as a national disgrace, signed by traitors. The party instead aimed at a restoration of monarchy, a repeal of the dictated peace treaty and reacquisition of all lost territories and colonies.

During the mid-1920s, the DNVP moderated its profile, accepting republican institutions in practice while still calling for a return to monarchy in its manifesto, and participating in centre-right coalition governments on federal and state levels. It broadened its voting base—winning as much as 20.5% in the December 1924 German federal election—and supported the election of Paul von Hindenburg as President of Germany () in 1925. Under the leadership of the populist media entrepreneur Alfred Hugenberg from 1928, the party moved to the far-right and reclaimed its reactionary nationalist and anti-republican rhetoric and changed its strategy to mass mobilisation, plebiscites, and support of authoritarian rule by the president instead of work by parliamentary means. At the same time, it lost many votes to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rising Nazi Party. Several prominent Nazis began their careers in the DNVP.

After 1929, the DNVP co-operated with the Nazis, joining forces in the Harzburg Front of 1931, forming coalition governments in some states and finally supporting Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany () in January 1933. Initially, the DNVP had a number of ministers in Hitler&#x27;s government, but the party quickly lost influence and eventually dissolved itself in June 1933, giving way to the Nazis&#x27; single-party dictatorship with the majority of its former members joining the Nazi Party. The Nazis allowed the remaining former DNVP members in the Reichstag, the civil service, and the police to continue with their jobs and left the rest of the party membership generally in peace. During the Second World War, several prominent former DNVP members, such as Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, were involved in the German resistance to Nazism and took part in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944.

== History ==
=== National Opposition, 1918–1924 ===
The party was formed in December 1918 by a merger of the German Conservative Party and the Free Conservative Party of the old monarchic German Empire. It was joined soon afterward by the most right-wing section of the former National Liberal Party, and most supporters of the dissolved radically nationalist German Fatherland Party, the antisemitic Christian Social Party and German Völkisch Party. Thus, the party united most of the formerly fragmented conservative spectrum of the Empire. The process that led to the DNVP began on 22 November 1918 when an ad appeared in a number of Berlin newspapers calling for a new right-wing party for &quot;which we suggest the name of German National People&#x27;s Party&quot;. The founding of the DNVP was a response to the November Revolution of 1918 and the sense of extreme crisis it had engendered amongst the German right, where there were widespread fears that society was on the verge of destruction. As a result of the crisis atmosphere of late 1918, a very wide assortment of different parties came together to form the DNVP. This proved to be as much weakness as a strength as the DNVP had strong fissiparous tendencies throughout its existence, which was the product of the various different streams of conservatism that found themselves flowing uneasily together in one party. There was much disagreement about who was to lead the new party, and Oskar Hergt was chosen as leader on 19 December 1918 very much as the compromise candidate, being a little-known civil servant who was thereforth acceptable to all the factions. British historian Ian Kershaw wrote that ever since the late 19th century there had been tension on the German right between traditional conservatives and the more radical populist &quot;völkisch&quot; elements, saying: &quot;Even the German National People&#x27;s Party, itself with many fascistic characteristics, could only uneasily accommodate the new strength of the populist forces on the radical Right&quot;.

At the founding convention in December 1918, Siegfried von Kardorff gave the keynote speech, in which he stated &quot;Our new party, in which friendly right-wing parties have united, has no past and rejects any responsibility for the past. We have a present, and God willing, a good future&quot;, to which the delegates shouted &quot;But without the Jews!&quot; The task of writing out a common platform acceptable to all fell to a committee headed by Ulrich von Hassell. Reflecting a strong anti-Semitic orientation, right from the start Jews were banned from joining the DNVP. In the elections on 19 January 1919 for the National Assembly that was to write the new constitution, the DNVP produced a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Jews—Germany&#x27;s vampires!&quot;

Generally hostile towards the republican Weimar constitution, the DNVP spent most of the inter-war period in opposition. Of the 19 cabinets between 1919 and 1932, the DNVP took part in only two governments and their total period in office over this 13-year period was 27 months. The party was largely supported by landowners, especially from the agricultural, conservative and Protestant Prussian east (East Elbia), and wealthy industrialists, moreover by monarchist academics, pastors, high-ranking government officials, farmers, craftsmen, small traders, nationalist white-collar and blue-collar workers. Because most of the Protestant aristocracy, high civil servants, the Lutheran clergy, the &quot;Bildungsbürgertum&quot; (the upper middle-class), university professors, and &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (high schools for these destined to go to university) teachers supported the DNVP until 1930, the party had a cultural influence on German life far beyond what its share of the vote would suggest. Because so many university professors and &quot;Gymnasium&quot; teachers supported the DNVP, everyone who went to university in Germany under the Weimar republic was exposed in some way to &quot;Deutsch-National&quot; influence. More women than men voted for the DNVP, and despite the party&#x27;s traditionalist values, women were very active in the DNVP. The women in the DNVP came mostly from the evangelical Protestant church leagues, associations representing housewives who had become politically active during World War I and women who been active in groups like the Pan-German League, the Colonial League and the Navy League. The women in the DNVP tended to be most concerned with wiping out &quot;trash and dirt&quot; which was their term for pornography and prostitution, and was seen as especially threatening to women. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer called the DNVP &quot;...the party of the traditional, often radical anti-Semitic elites...&quot; The writer Kurt Tucholsky wrote in 1924 that &quot;Even in Jewish circles (of which a portion would still vote German-National today, were the party not so stupid to trade in anti-Semitism) and even in merchant circles, this way of thinking prevails.&quot; Extremely nationalistic and reactionary and originally favouring restoration of the Hohenzollern monarchy, it later supported the creation of an authoritarian state as a substitute. Its supporters came from dedicated nationalists, the aristocracy, parts of the middle class and big business. The DNVP had little appeal to Catholics and almost its entire support came from Protestant areas. 

The Lutheran character of the party was stressed early on, with DNVP making direct appeals to Lutheran voters. Party campaigners also made anti-Catholic appeals – a DNVP political leaftlet in Berlin read: &quot;No Romish intrigues are going to rob us of our heritage of the Reformation. Protestant spirit must remain strong in our Fatherland.&quot; The Anti-Catholic character of the DNVP is traced back to the tradition of Kulturkampf, under which Otto von Bismarck &quot;associated the meaning of being German with Protestantism&quot;. Catholicism was portrayed as un-German and associated with foreign and &quot;papist&quot; influence. As such, DNVP focused solely on Protestant voters while marginalising and attacking Roman Catholics - Richard Steigmann-Gall remarks that in Weimar Germany, &quot;the narrative of national identity in Germany was written in a distinctly Protestant language&quot;. The DNVP opposed establishing relations with the Vatican and rejected the Prussian Concordat of 1929, arguing that Germany should not make formal agreements with the Catholic Church. The party refused to court Catholic voters, and Alfred Hugenberg rejected ideas to establish local Catholic committees of the DNVP, even when advised that this may damage the electoral appeal of the party. According to historian Larry Eugene Jones, the DNVP expressed &quot;deeply ingrained anti-Catholic sentiments&quot;, and party officials went as far as proclaiming that DNVP was &quot;bound to Protestant structures&quot; and &quot;did not stand for Catholic interests.&quot; German Catholics overwhelmingly refused to participate in the 1929 German referendum, displaying their disapproval of Hugenberg and his party. The Catholic clergy was critical of the German Right and was hostile towards the DNVP; the party was openly denounced and attacked by members of the Catholic clergy, such as the Archbishop of Breslau Adolf Bertram or Bishop of Trier Franz Rudolf Bornewasser. German Catholics were also prohibited from joining right-wing paramilitary organizations such as the Young German Order and DNVP-affiliated Stahlhelm, and Catholic bishops barred Catholics and clergymen from sitting in the DNVP parliamentary delegations. 

When the National Assembly convened to write the new constitution for Germany on 6 February 1919, the DNVP&#x27;s chief contribution to the debates was a lengthy defence of the former Emperor Wilhelm II by Clemens von Delbrück, and a series of long speeches by other DNVP deputies defending Germany&#x27;s actions in the July Crisis of 1914, the ideology of Pan-Germanism and the decision to adopt unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917. None of these had anything to do with the task at hand, namely to write a new constitution. The DNVP made no contribution to the drafting of the new constitution. In June 1919, the &quot;Reichstag&quot; had to ratify the Treaty of Versailles in the face of a warning from the Allies that World War I would resume if it was not ratified. The DNVP made certain that the other parties in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; were going to vote for the treaty, and then voted against it. The DNVP was secure in the knowledge that its vote would not cause the resumption of the war while the odium of Versailles would be borne by the other parties. Afterwards, the DNVP started a racist campaign against the presence of Senegalese and Vietnamese troops serving in the French army of occupation in the Rhineland (the so-called &quot;Black Horror on the Rhine&quot;), claiming that African and Asian men were genetically programmed to rape white women with DNVP politician Käthe Schirmacher stating in a speech: &quot;The lust of white, yellow and black Frenchmen for German women leads to daily violence!&quot; Schirmacher wrote in her diary in 1919 that: &quot;The only thing uniting us with Poland is our common hatred of Juda&quot;.

It favoured a monarchist platform and was strongly opposed to the Weimar Republic in domestic affairs and Treaty of Versailles in foreign affairs. Typical of the party&#x27;s views about Weimar was a 1919 pamphlet by Karl Helfferich entitled &quot;Erzberger Must Go!&quot;, which was in equal terms violently anti-democratic, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic. The target of the pamphlet was Matthias Erzberger of the &quot;Zentrum&quot;, whom Hellferich called &quot;the puppet of the Jews&quot;, and called openly for his assassination to avenge his &quot;crimes&quot; such as signing the armistice ending World War I. Helfferich wrote that Erzberger&#x27;s career was &quot;a sordid mixing of political activity with his own pecuniary advantage... at the crucial moment of the war, acting for his Habsburg-Bourbon patrons, he cowardly attacked German policy from the rear with his July action, and thereby destroyed in the German people the belief in and therefore the will to victory&quot; [By &quot;July action&quot; Helfereich was referring to the Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917, which Erzberger played a major role in writing]. Helfferich especially hated Erzberger for making a speech in July 1919 that blamed him for the bad shape of German budget, with Erzberger noting during the war Helfferich had decided not to raise taxes, and instead ran up colossal debts which he planned to pay off by imposing reparations on the Allies once Germany won the war. Erzberger sued Helfferich for libel over his statement that Erzberger was &quot;dishonestly combining political activity with his own financial interests&quot;. Amid much media attention the libel trial ended on 12 March 1920 with the judge ruling that some of Helfferich&#x27;s statements were true while fining Helfferich a nominal sum for technical libel for the statements that he declared that Helfferich lacked sufficient evidence to back up with. The German historian Eberhard Kolb wrote none of Helfferich&#x27;s claims were true, and that the outcome of the libel case was due to a conservative judge who disliked democracy. The judge&#x27;s bias could be seen in that the judge went out of his way in his ruling to praise Helfferich for his &quot;patriotic motives&quot; in attacking Erzberger.

In the run-up to the Kapp Putsch of March 1920, the DNVP leaders were informed by Wolfgang Kapp in February 1920 that a &quot;putsch&quot; to overthrow the government would soon occur, and asked for their support. Kapp received an equivocal answer, but the party&#x27;s leaders did not inform the government a &quot;putsch&quot; was being planned. During the Kapp &quot;Putsch&quot; of March 1920, the DNVP took an ambiguous stance, reflecting a strong sympathy for the aims of the &quot;putsch&quot; without coming entirely in support out of the fear that the &quot;putsch&quot; might fail. One of the DNVP leaders, Gottfried Traub served as &quot;Minister of Church and Cultural Affairs&quot; in Kapp&#x27;s provisional government while Paul Bang of the Pan-German League was going to serve in the provisional government, though he backed out later on 13 March 1920 on the grounds that the &quot;putsch&quot; was &quot;hopeless&quot;. Within the party&#x27;s leadership, Count Kuno von Westarp was in favour of supporting the &quot;putsch&quot; while Oskar Hergt was opposed. After the &quot;putsch&quot; failed, the DNVP issued a statement that condemned the government far more harshly for resorting to the &quot;lawless&quot; method of a general strike to defeat the &quot;putsch&quot; than it did the &quot;putsch&quot; itself, which was portrayed as an understandable, if extreme response to the existence of the republic.

The outcome of the Erzberger-Helfferich libel trial encouraged the DNVP to engage in a campaign of vituperative and vitriolic attacks on leaders of the Weimar Coalition who supported the republic, usually accompanied with calls for the assassination of the &quot;traitors&quot;, which was to be DNVP&#x27;s main contribution to politics for next several years. The DNVP was well known for outrageous, often childish antics such as mailing a dead dog to the French Ambassador to protest against paying reparations to France and for launching a campaign of mailing parcels containing human excrement to Social Democratic leaders. The campaign against the &quot;Black Horror on the Rhine&quot; occupied much of the DNVP&#x27;s time in the early 1920s. Kolb wrote that the DNVP played a major role in the &quot;brutalization of politics&quot; in the Weimar Republic with its relentless denigration of its enemies as &quot;traitors&quot; together with its insistence that murder was a perfectly acceptable procedure for dealing with one&#x27;s political opponents, who the DNVP claimed did not deserve to live.
The climax of the campaign against the leaders of the Weimar Coalition occurred in February 1922 when Walther Rathenau became Foreign Minister, which led the DNVP to launch an especially vicious anti-Semitic campaign against Rathenau claiming that &quot;German honour&quot; had been sullied by the appointment of &quot;the international Jew&quot; Rathenau as Foreign Minister, which could only be avenged with Rathenau&#x27;s assassination. In an article by Wilhelm Henning, it was claimed Rathenau was somehow involved with the assassination of Count Wilhelm von Mirbach, the German ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1918, and that the fact that Rathenau did not mention Mirbach&#x27;s assassination during his visit to the Soviet Union in April 1922 being presented as proof that Rathenau had a hand in Mirbach&#x27;s death. When Rathenau was assassinated on 24 June 1922, the &quot;Zentrum&quot; Chancellor Joseph Wirth angrily turned towards the DNVP&#x27;s &quot;Reichstag&quot; delegation and with his finger pointing clearly at Helfferich, shouted &quot;The enemy is on the right! Here are those who drip poison into the wounds of the German people!&quot;. Wirth, who was shaken by the murder of his friend Rathenau, pushed through the Reichstag the Law for the Protection of the Republic on 21 July 1922. It increased the penalties for conspiring to political assassination and allowed the government to ban organizations that attempted to undermine the constitutionally established republican form of government. Only the DNVP, the Communists and the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (BVP) voted against the law, with every other party voting for it. Wirth would have liked to use the new law to ban the DNVP, but was unable to do so because no links could be established between the DNVP and the Organisation Consul terrorist group. Faced with a possible ban for encouraging terrorism after the Rathenau assassination and a public backlash over its initially jubilant reaction to Rathenau&#x27;s murder, the party started to crack down on its extreme &quot;völkisch&quot; wing, who had been the most vociferous in calling for Rathenau&#x27;s blood. To stop a total break with its &quot;völkisch&quot; wing, in September 1922 a &quot;&quot;völkisch&quot; study group&quot; under Wilhelm Kube was set up. Despite Kube&#x27;s best efforts to work out a compromise, the leading &quot;völkisch&quot; activists&#x27; Wilhelm Henning, Reinhold Wulle and Albrecht von Graefe all resigned from the party in October 1922 when the party&#x27;s leader Oskar Hergt supported by Otto Hoetzsch and Count Kuno von Westarp made it clear that they wanted no more calls for assassinations, which had caused a major public relations problem. Henning, Wulle and Graefe founded the German Völkisch Freedom Party in December 1922.

In September 1923, the DVP Chancellor Gustav Stresemann announced the end of &quot;passive resistance&quot; to the occupation of the Ruhr (&quot;Ruhrkampf&quot;) under the grounds that hyperinflation had destroyed the economy and the &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot; must end in order to save Germany. As a result, the DNVP found itself joining forces with the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in denouncing the end of the &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot; as treason and as a cowardly surrender to &quot;a half-sated irreconcilable France&quot;. The DNVP announced that if they were in charge that they would continue the &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot; regardless of the economic costs and misery.

=== Dawes Plan vote: a change in direction ===
At a party conference in early April 1924, the DNVP had come out clearly against the proposed restructuring of Germany&#x27;s reparations payments known as the Dawes Plan, which the DNVP denounced as the &quot;second Versailles&quot;. Part of the restructuring was an 800 million Reichsmark loan provided primarily by a consortium of Wall Street banks led by the House of Morgan that would help stabilize the currency after the hyper-inflation of 1923 that had all but destroyed the economy. Helfferich, the DNVP&#x27;s leading economic expert, had published two detailed critiques in &quot;Die Kreuzzeitung&quot; that purported to prove that the Dawes Plan existed only to &quot;enslave&quot; Germany by allowing the Allies to take control of and exploit the German economy forever. The spring 1924 campaign was largely led and organized by charismatic, media savvy Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz who was presented as the &quot;savior&quot; type figure, able to rally together the entire nation to both win the election and then restore Germany back as a great power. The ineffectual Hergt had chosen to stay on the sidelines in order to improve his party&#x27;s chances. Unusually for a DNVP politician, Tirpitz based his campaign in Munich as part of an effort to win Catholic support. In the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 4 May 1924, the DNVP posted its best showing yet, winning 19% of the vote.

A major problem for the DNVP throughout its entire existence was the tension caused between its tendency towards a policy of total opposition to the Weimar Republic and pressure from many of its supporters for the DNVP to participate in the government. Since the DNVP was unlikely to win the majority of the seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on account of the proportional representation system, as a party committed to total opposition to the republic it doomed itself to being an opposition party forever. Many of the DNVP&#x27;s supporters made it clear by 1924 that they were unhappy about supporting a party whose role was purely negative in opposing everything that the government did while refusing to take part in any of the coalition governments. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett wrote &quot;At no time during the Weimar Republic did they make a single constructive contribution to the government of the country&quot;. At the same time, there was another equally influential fraction within the DNVP who took it for granted that it was only a matter of time before the republic disintegrated, and that the best thing to do was to maintain the current course of total opposition to the republic, secure in knowing that all of the blame for the current problems would rest with the parties of the Weimar coalition who were willing to assume the burdens of office.
In the summer of 1924, these tensions came out in the open with a vigorous display of party in-fighting over the question of whether the DNVP&#x27;s MdRs (German MdR: &quot;Mitglied des Reichstags&quot;—Member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;) should vote for the Dawes Plan or not. Initially, the DNVP had promised to vote against the Dawes Plan when it came up for ratification in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on the grounds that Germany should not have to pay any reparations at all, resulting in many of the economic lobbying groups that donated to the party such as the Landbund, the Reich Association of German Industry (RDI) and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce threatening to cease donating to the party forever if its MdRs voted against the Dawes Plan. The Dawes Plan was a crucial element in the international attempt to stabilise the German economy after hyper-inflation had destroyed the German economy in 1923, and the economic lobbying groups that supported the DNVP were appalled at the party&#x27;s intention to reject the Dawes Plan, and thereby risk a return to the economic chaos of 1923. As the parties of the Weimar coalition did not have a two-thirds majority in the Reichstag, it was clear that the DNVP would have to vote for the Dawes Plan to have it ratified. The American banks had demanded as one of the conditions of the loan that the Reich government put up the state-owned Deutsche Reichsbahn railroad as collateral, but the 1919 constitution stated the Reichsbahn could not be used as collateral. Thus to receive the Dawes Plan loan required the Reich government to amend the constitution to put up the &quot;Reichsbahn&quot; as collateral, which required a two-thirds majority in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;.

At first, the DNVP tried to avoid an internal split caused by the up-coming Dawes Plan vote by insisting upon several conditions in exchange for voting for the Dawes Plan such as the appointment of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz as Chancellor, firing Stresemann as the foreign minister and the removal of Otto Braun as Prussian minister-president together with the rest of the Social Democrats from the Prussian government. The British historian Edgar Feuchtwanger commented that the demand that the Anglophobic Admiral von Tirpitz be appointed Chancellor at a time when the British government was applying heavy pressure on France to reduce reparations on Germany showed that DNVP had a stunning &quot;lack of realism&quot;. The Chancellor Wilhelm Marx rejected all of the DNVP conditions and informed the party that they either vote for or against the Dawes Plan, thereby settling off a bitter factional battle within the DNVP. In addition, Stresemann—who had privately bristled at Admiral Tirpitz&#x27;s charges that he was conducting a foreign policy of &quot;Ohnmachtspolitik&quot; (policy of powerlessness) before the Allies—asked the German embassies in London, Paris, and Washington to inquire of their respective host governments what would be their reaction to Tirpitz becoming Chancellor. The very negative international response that the prospect of Tirpitz as the Chancellor generated was then leaked by Stresemann to various &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputies as a way of showing how absurd the DNVP was in demanding that Tirpitz being appointed Chancellor, and how isolated Germany would be with Tirpitz as the leader. In an editorial, the &quot;New York World&quot; wrote &quot;To any German who wishes his country to enjoy the benefit of an international loan, it must be sufficiently obvious that the mere mention of the bearded hero of the submarine offensive is madness pure and simple&quot; while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of London wrote in a leader (editorial) that the prospect of Tirpitz becoming Chancellor was &quot;a masterpiece of folly&quot;. The French government issued a statement saying Tirpitz as Chancellor would be the end of any effort to improve Franco-German relations while the American and Belgian ambassadors both issued warnings to the German government that Tirpitz as Chancellor would be a source of tension in their relations with Germany. The British Ambassador Lord D&#x27;Abernon warned that &quot;If the Germans want to find a closed front hostile to them they cannot do anything better but to make Tirpitz Chancellor of the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. The clash between Stresemann and Tirpitz over the Dawes Plan marked the beginning of a long feud that was to continue until Stresemann&#x27;s death in 1929. Right from the moment that Admiral Tirpitz was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in May 1924, he emerged as Stresemann&#x27;s most &quot;tenacious adversary&quot; in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and presented himself as the unabashed champion of German power politics, a man unafraid, indeed proud to state his belief that Germany should be the world&#x27;s greatest power.
Finally, President Friedrich Ebert applied more pressure by warning the DNVP that if the Dawes Plan were rejected, he would dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for early elections, and the party would then face the wrath of angry voters. After much internal fighting between the pro- and anti-Dawes Plan factions, in order to prevent the party from splitting in two, it was announced that the vote on the Dawes Plan would be a free vote with no party discipline and accordingly DNVP MdRs would vote on the Dawes Plan as they saw fit. The vote on the Dawes Plan on 29 August 1924 was described as &quot;one of the most dramatically moving votes ever experienced by the German &quot;Reichstag&quot;, since the final result remained uncertain until the very last minute&quot;. About half of the DNVP MdRs voted for the Dawes Plan while the other half voted against. The final vote was 49 DNVP MdRs for acceptance vs. 48 MdRs against. The support of the pro-Dawes Plan DNVP MdRs was just enough to get the Dawes Plan ratified by the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. The passage of the Dawes Plan produced much turmoil in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; with considerable cheering and jeering. One of the anti-Dawes Plan DNVP deputies, Alfred Hugenberg was so enraged by the passage of the Dawes Plan that he screamed on the floor of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; that those DNVP MdRs who voted for the Dawes Plan should be expelled from the party. The National Socialist MP General Erich Ludendorff shouted at the pro-Dawes Plan DNVP MdRs that &quot;This is a shame for Germany! Ten years ago I won the battle of Tannenberg. Today you have made a Tannenberg victory possible for the Jews!&quot;.

The Dawes Plan vote brought to the surface the conflict between the party&#x27;s pragmatic wing most closely associated with industrial interests and farmers from the western part of Germany who were prepared to work inside the system within certain limits if only to safeguard their own interests versus those who were mostly closely associated with the rural areas of East Elbia, especially the &quot;Junkers&quot; (landed nobility) and the Pan-German League who wanted to destroy democracy with no thought to the consequences. The in-fighting over the Dawes Plan together with the related bad feelings within the DNVP&#x27;s &quot;Reichstag&quot; delegation led to Oskar Hergt being ousted later in 1924 as the party&#x27;s leader and his replacement with the interim leader of Johann Friedrich Winckler who in turn was replaced by Count Kuno von Westarp. In the bitter aftermath of the Dawes Plan vote, the influential Land associations of Pomerania, East Prussia and Schleswig-Holstein all passed resolutions attacking Hergt for his &quot;betrayal&quot; of the party&#x27;s principles by allowing a free vote on the &quot;second Versailles&quot; of the Dawes Plan, instead of imposing party discipline to force the entire caucus to vote against the bail-out. A month later in September 1924 the general Land association passed a resolution calling on Hergt to resign within a month if he could not form a government; as he failed to do this forced him to resign in October 1924.

=== Mid-1920s: a tack towards the centre ===

Initially, the change of leadership made little difference. In its platform for the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 7 December 1924, the party declared the following:
″Our party remains as it was: monarchist and &quot;völkisch&quot;, Christian and social. Our goals remain the same as our name: German and national. Our colours remain black, white and red: our resolution is firmer than ever: to create a Germany free of Jewish control and French domination, free from parliamentary intrigue and the populist rule of big capital&quot;.

Those parties that had voted against the Dawes Plan lost seats while that had voted for the Dawes Plan gained seats, which as half the DNVP caucus had voted for the Plan while the other half had voted against meant the DNVP made only very modest gains in the second 1924 election. The outcome of the second 1924 election together with the appointment of the nonpartisan Hans Luther as Chancellor in early 1925 allowed Count von Westarp to persuade the DNVP to join Luther&#x27;s government. While it sought the ultimate demise of Weimar Republic, it participated in its politics and ruling government for a time in the mid-1920s to keep Social Democrats out of power. Before its alliance with Nazis, the party sought support of the national liberal German People&#x27;s Party.
Between 1925 and 1928, the party slightly moderated its tone and actively cooperated in successive governments. In the presidential election of 1925, the DNVP supported Karl Jarres for president, who was defeated in the first round by &quot;Zentrum&quot;&#x27;s Wilhelm Marx, who however failed to gain a majority. Fearing that Marx would win the second round (something made the more likely by the fact that the SPD&#x27;s Otto Braun had dropped out to endorse Marx), Admiral Tirpitz made a dramatic visit to the home of the retired Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg to ask him to run for the second round in order to &quot;save&quot; Germany by gaining the presidency for the right. Tirpitz persuaded Hindenburg to run, and though Hindenburg won the election as a non-party candidate, the DNVP strongly supported the Field Marshal. General Otto von Feldmann of the DNVP worked very closely with Hindenburg during the 1925 election as Hindenburg&#x27;s &quot;political agent&quot;. Despite the move to the center at the level of high politics, at the grass-roots of the party the opposite direction prevailed. Starting in 1924, the DNVP&#x27;s newsletter for women (which was written entirely by female volunteers) started to vehemently insist that German women only marry a &quot;Nordic man&quot; and raise their children to be racists. From the mid-1920s onwards, the women party activists started to draft plans calling for the end of all &quot;Jewish cultural influence&quot; in Germany, banning Jews from working as teachers and writers, making eugenics into state policy with a new class of bureaucrats to be called &quot;racial guardians&quot; to be created in order to assess a couple&#x27;s &quot;racial worth&quot; before allowing them to marry or not, and breaking German citizenship into two grades of those allowed to marry and those who would not.
In 1926, under its leader Count von Westarp the DNVP took office by joining the coalition government led by Chancellor Wilhelm Marx with the stated aim of pulling German politics towards the right. After the &quot;betrayal&quot; of the Dawes Plan vote, the fraction of the DNVP mostly closely associated with the Pan-German League had started a major effort to take over the party&#x27;s grass-roots to prevent another &quot;betrayal&quot;, a slow, but steady process that would ultimately prove the undoing of Count von Westarp. During its time in the government, the DNVP made a major push for higher tariffs on agricultural products from abroad, which pleased the party&#x27;s powerful rural wing, but came to grief over the Locarno Treaties. By serving in a government that signed Locarno, which recognized Alsace-Lorraine as part of France and voluntarily agreed to accept the demilitarized status of the Rhineland, many party activists charged that Westarp had committed another &quot;betrayal&quot; by serving in a government that accepted the &quot;robbery&quot; of what was claimed to be German land. A result of this anger was that even through the DNVP ministers had served in the Cabinet that had signed Locarno, the party&#x27;s MdRs voted against ratifying Locarno in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, and the DNVP walked out of the government in protest at Locarno. Another problem for the DNVP was the 1926 referendum, in which the Communists proposed to confiscate without compensation all of the property belonging to the former Imperial and royal families of Germany and give it to small farmers, homeless people and those living on war pensions. The DNVP leadership was totally against the idea of expropriating the property of royalty, but many of its voters, especially small farmers, were not and voted yes on 20 June 1926, a development that strongly suggested that many DNVP voters were starting to feel that the party leadership was not representing them effectively.

Westarp&#x27;s efforts to include the DNVP within the government tied himself and the party in many knots since he had to engage in compromises with his coalition partners that offended much of the party&#x27;s grass-roots, especially the more hardline fraction that disapproved of participation in the government while all the time insisting that he was staying faithful to the party&#x27;s original platform of relentless opposition to the republic, which made him look both insincere and unprincipled. This was particularly the case because Westarp continued to maintain that he was a monarchist utterly committed to restoring the House of Hohenzollern while his party was participating in a republican government. An especially difficult case for Westarp came in 1927 when it became time to renew the Law for the Protection of the Republic, a law passed in 1922 in the aftermath of Rathenau&#x27;s assassination, and which was clearly aimed at the DNVP for its incitement of murder at the time. Section V of the law had implicitly banned the former Emperor Wilhelm II from returning to Germany, an aspect of the law that greatly offended the DNVP at the time. By 1927, many of the DNVP&#x27;s supporters, especially the &quot;Junkers&quot; had concluded the restoration of the monarchy was not possible, and so successfully pressured Westarp into voting for a renewal of the law rather than see the DNVP walk out of the government and thereby lose a chance for higher tariffs on agricultural imports. Westarp attempted to justify his support of the law he had once opposed by arguing that it was really aimed at the Communists while at the same time claiming the DNVP was opposed in principle to the Law for the Protection of the Republic.

A further problem for the DNVP was the rise of rural rage in the late 1920s. By 1927, though Germany itself was overall very prosperous, a steep economic decline had begun in rural areas, which was only to greatly worsen with the coming of the Great Depression in 1929. By late 1927, it was clear that the increases in agrarian tariffs that the DNVP ministers had forced through had made no impact on the continuing economic decline in the countryside, and as result a mood of palpable anger and resentment had set in the countryside of northern Germany with many DNVP voters damning their own party. The political repercussion of rural rage was the rise of a number of small parties representing rural voters in northern Germany such as the Agricultural League, German Farmers&#x27; Party and the Christian-National Peasants&#x27; and Farmers&#x27; Party, which all took away traditional DNVP voters, a development that contributed significantly to DNVP&#x27;s poor showing in the 1928 elections. Finally, Admiral Tirpitz who had done so much for the DNVP&#x27;s good showing in elections in 1924, had often come into conflict with Westarp over his policy of half-hearted participation in the government, and chose not to run in 1928, claiming very publicly that the DNVP needed more aggressive leaders than Westarp. The man Tirpitz chose to continue his work of winning Bavaria for the DNVP, General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck did not have the same mass appeal and in 1928, the DNVP won only half the vote in Bavaria that it managed to do in December 1924.

=== Hugenberg and the national bloc: the Young Plan referendum ===
The disastrous showing at the polls in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 20 May 1928 (the party&#x27;s share of votes fell from 21% in 1924 to 14% in 1928) led to a new outbreak of party in-fighting. The immediate cause of the in-fighting was an article published in July 1928 entitled &quot;Monarchism&quot; &quot;(Monarchismus)&quot; by Walther Lambach, a board member of the German National Association of Commercial Employees (DHV). In his article, Lambach stated that the restoration of the monarchy was no longer possible and that for almost all Germans under the age of thirty the DNVP&#x27;s incessant talk of bringing back the monarchy was irrelevant at best and downright offputting at worse. Lambach wrote that for conservative Germans President Hindenburg had long since replaced the former Kaiser as the object of their affections and that the DNVP&#x27;s poor showing in the May elections was a result of the party running on a platform of restoring the monarchy, a goal that most Germans were simply not interested in. Lambach&#x27;s article with its call for the DNVP to transform itself into a party of conservative republicans set off a storm, with the party&#x27;s core monarchist supporters successfully pressuring Westarp to expel Lambach. Led by Alfred Hugenberg, the enraged monarchists then turned their sights on Westarp himself, claiming he was a weak leader who let republican elements into the party. Hugenberg was helped by the fact that only 15% of DVNP voters were party members, and the local party offices were dominated by members of the local aristocracy, retired civil servants from the Wilhelmine era and professional lobbyists, making the membership of the DVNP far more right-wing than its voters. The American historian John Leopold noted that the local offices &quot;...tended to accept hard-line propaganda literally, but the interest groups which filled the party&#x27;s coffers insisted on coalition and compromise. Parliamentary leaders schooled in rationalizing varied principles followed the dictates of lobbyists in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, but then reverted to an ideological approach when on the stump...Radicals exploited the divergence of principle and practice. Had party leaders instructed their electorate in the realities of politics, the DVNP might have evolved into the dynamic conservative party that some &quot;Reichstag&quot; delegates belateldly envisioned.&quot;

In October 1928, Hugenberg, leader of the party&#x27;s hardliner wing, became chairman. Hugenberg returned the party to a course of fundamental opposition against the Republic with a greater emphasis on nationalism and reluctant co-operation with the Nazi Party. Hugenberg was utterly devoid of personal charisma or charm, but he was a successful industrialist and media magnate, a fabulously wealthy man whose talents at devising business strategies which had made him a millionaire many times over were felt to be equally applicable to the arena of politics.

Hugenberg was elected leader largely through the support of the faction associated with the Pan-German League who had been steadily taking over the party&#x27;s grass-roots ever since the Dawes Plan vote of 1924, and who wanted a return to the politics of the early 1920s. Hugenberg and Heinrich Class, the League&#x27;s leader had been friends since the 1890s, and Hugenberg was a founding member of the League. Reflecting this background, Hugenberg proved himself to be a consistent champion of German imperialism, and one of the major themes of his time as leader was the call for Germany to resume overseas expansion and to regain the lost colonies in Africa. The other theme that he first set out in an article in the autumn of 1928 entitled &quot;Party Bloc or Mush&quot; &quot;(Block oder Brei)&quot; was that the DNVP should transform from a broad but heterogeneous and divided party of notables (in Hugenberg&#x27;s words &quot;mush&quot;) into a coherent and clear-cut force with a hierarchical leadership &quot;(Führerprinzip)&quot; and mass appeal, stressing plebiscitary action rather than parliamentarianism. Hugenberg declared that what was needed a &quot;bloc&quot; of like-minded people that would be solid as stone in upholding its values. About Hugenberg, British historian Edgar Feuchtwanger wrote:

Hugenberg was an abrasive, stubborn, difficult personality, opinionated and confrontational. His emergence into a central position in right-wing politics had a very divisive effect which in the end benefited only Hitler. Many on the right, from Hindenburg downwards, including members of the &quot;Ruhrlade&quot;, the inner cabinet of the western coal and steel industry, found him increasingly wrong-headed and impossible to work with. When Hugenberg began to attract the political limelight his characteristic slogan was &quot;solid or mash&quot; (&quot;Block oder Brei&quot;). Those who wanted a broad conservative party able to influence republican politics were the mash, his prescription was dynamic force through principled confrontation.

In July 1929, Hugenberg decided that the best way of regaining popularity was to use the section of the Weimar constitution that allowed upon collecting a certain number of signatures a referendum to be held, in this case on the Young Plan. Hugenberg successfully collected enough signatures to initiate a referendum on his Freedom Law which called for cancelling the Young Plan together with all reparations. The fact that the Young Plan reduced reparations and committed the Allies to exiting the Rhineland in June 1930 (which was five years earlier than what Versailles had called for) was irrelevant to Hugenberg. He argued that a properly patriotic government would not pay any reparations at all and would force the Allies to leave the Rhineland at once. As such, Hugenberg drafted &quot;A Bill against the Enslavement of the German People&quot; which declared acceptance of the Young Plan to be high treason under the grounds that Germany should not have to pay any reparations, and that those ministers who signed the Young Plan on behalf of the &quot;Reich&quot; government and those who voted for the Young Plan in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; should be prosecuted for high treason. Hugenberg made much of the fact that Young Plan was not scheduled to end until 1988, which he portrayed in stark terms as forcing generations of Germans to live under a crushing burden of reparations for the next sixty years (Hugenberg did not mention the fact that the Young Plan was not scheduled to end until 1988 because the plan had greatly reduced annual reparation payments, which was why the payments had been spread out over sixty years).

In pushing for the referendum on the Young Plan, Hugenberg was quite consciously seeking to polarize German politics into two extremes, namely the &quot;national&quot; camp opposed to the Young Plan and everyone else, believing that such a polarization would work for his own benefit. Hugenberg saw compromise and negotiation as so much weakness that led to DNVP&#x27;s poor showing in the elections of May 1928 and believed that the best chances for the DNVP to come to power was by creating a political climate where no compromise and negotiation was possible by seeking to divide Germany into two diametrically opposed blocs with no middle ground in between. Hugenberg did not actually expect to win the referendum on the Young Plan, but rather the referendum was intended to be in the modern parlance a wedge issue that would polarize politics and create a situation where one would either be for or against the &quot;national&quot; camp. The American historian John Leopold wrote that &quot;Hugenberg debated political issues in terms of a simplistic, philosophic disjunction—a man was either for the nation or he was against it&quot;. This was especially the case because the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; government of the Social Democratic Chancellor Hermann Müller was composed of the left-wing SPD, the right of center Catholic &quot;Zentrum&quot;, the liberal DDP and the moderate conservative DVP—in short all of the parties that Hugenberg was seeking to destroy by forcing them to defend the Young Plan, and therefore making it seem they were in favor of paying reparations and the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, the parties of the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; were in favor of a gradualist, step-by-step approach of doing away with Versailles by negotiation instead of the confrontational &quot;Katastrophenpolitik&quot; (catastrophe politics) of the early 1920s that led to the disastrous &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot; and hyper-inflation of 1923, a nuance that did not interest Hugenberg in the slightest. Hugenberg for his part regarded &quot;Katastrophenpolitik&quot; as a good idea that was unfortunately abandoned, and made it clear that he wanted a return to &quot;Katastrophenpolitik&quot;.
In seeking a vote on the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;, Hugenberg was seeking nothing less than to begin the destruction of all of the middle-of-the-road parties in Germany in order to achieve a situation where the only alternatives for German voters would be the &quot;national&quot; parties and the Marxist parties. Hugenberg had initially planned in the winter of 1928–29 to use as his wedge issue a plan for constitutional reform, but dropped it in favor of a referendum on the Young Plan when he discovered that the idea of constitutional reform was too abstract for most people, and that portraying the Young Plan as a monstrous form of financial &quot;slavery&quot; for our &quot;children&#x27;s children&quot; was much more visceral, emotional and effective way of appealing to public opinion. The Canadian historian Richard Hamilton wrote that Freedom Law was pure demagoguery since rejection of the Young Plan would not mean the end of reparations as Hugenberg claimed, but rather Germany would continue to pay higher reparations under the Dawes Plan.

As part of his polarizing gambit, Hugenberg created the &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; (committee) for the People&#x27;s Rebellion Against the Young Plan in the summer of 1929, which was intended to be a sort of counter-parliament to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. The &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; comprised Hugenberg, Heinrich Class of the Pan-German League, Franz Seldte of &quot;Der Stahlehlm&quot; and Adolf Hitler of the NSDAP. Hugenberg saw himself as the leader of the &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; and believed through the &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; he would become the leader of the entire right-wing national bloc and in turn the bloc he intended to create would at last win enough seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; to have a majority. In the summer of 1929, two prominent DNVP &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputies Gottfried Treviranus and Hans Schlange-Schöningen resigned from the party&#x27;s caucus in protest against the &quot;Freedom Law&quot; as Hugenberg&#x27;s referendum bill was known which they called irresponsible in the extreme. They would be joined shortly afterwards by the former chairman Count Kuno von Westarp and 20 other DNVP MdRs leaving the party in December 1929 to form the more moderate Conservative People&#x27;s Party. The DNVP rebels objected in particular to the part of the &quot;Freedom Law&quot; which called for the prosecution of President Paul von Hindenburg on charges of high treason for fulfilling his constitutional obligation by signing the Young Plan into law after it been passed by the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. The rebels also objected to the prosecution of the entire Cabinet for endorsing the Young Plan and all of the MdRs for voting to ratify the plan, which the rebel faction called the height of demagogy. In the first 15 months of being led by the abrasive Hugenberg the DNVP was to lose 43 out of its 78 MdRs. Many Ruhr industrialists who normally supported the DNVP such as Abraham Frowein, Clemens Lammers, Carl Friedrich von Siemens, and Paul Silverberg signed a petition in the fall of 1929 objecting to the section of the &quot;Freedom Law&quot; calling for the prosecution of those politicians who supported the Young Plan as &quot;detrimental&quot; to the workings of politics and stated that a victory for the Yes side in the referendum on the Freedom Law &quot;would frustrate all efforts at improving the German situation for the foreseeable future&quot;. Hugenberg&#x27;s leadership brought about a break with the industrialists who were greatly displeased with Hugenberg&#x27;s unwillingness to take part in coalition governments. As a result, from 1929 onwards the millionaire Hugenberg spent his own considerable fortune to provide the funding for the DNVP. The dependence of the DNVP on Hugenberg to provide the bulk of the election funds very much strengthened Hugenberg&#x27;s leadership, making it impossible to challenge.

Hugenberg&#x27;s efforts led to the Young Plan referendum on 22 December 1929. The NSDAP were one of the groups which joined Hugenberg&#x27;s campaign against the Young Plan, and the resulting wave of publicity brought Adolf Hitler back into the limelight after five years of obscurity following his trial for high treason in 1924. After his trial in 1924, Hitler had been largely ignored; the 1929 edition of the diaries of Lord D&#x27;Abernon, the British ambassador to Germany 1920–26 had a footnote that read: &quot;He [Hitler] was finally released after six months and bound over for the rest of his sentence, thereafter fading into oblivion&quot;. At the various campaign rallies against the Young Plan in the autumn of 1929, the charismatic Hitler easily out-shone the stuffy Hugenberg, who as one of his aides Reinhold Quaatz wrote in his diary had &quot;no political sex appeal&quot;. Hugenberg was such an inept speaker that he almost never spoke before the &quot;Reichstag&quot; because his speeches induced laughter amongst those who listened to them. The fact that Admiral Tirpitz of the DNVP appeared alongside and spoke with Hitler at the anti-Young Plan rallies was taken by many of the DNVP voters as a sign that Hitler was now a respectable figure who was rubbing shoulders with war heroes. The referendum of 1929 brought about a major surge of interest in the National Socialists. Indeed, for many it marked the first time that they ever heard of Hitler, and it led during the winter of 1929–30 to a huge influx of new members into the NSDAP. Hamilton wrote that it was the 1929 referendum, which the National Socialists had treated as a gigantic 5-month-long free political ad (Hugenberg had paid for the entire referendum out of his own pocket) running from July to December 1929 that had enabled them to enter the political mainstream just as the Great Depression was beginning.

=== Decline and fall, 1930–1932 ===
Hugenberg had wanted to keep the &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; going even after the failure of the Freedom Law referendum, but the &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; dissolved in the spring of 1930 when the National Socialists walked out of it. When Hugenberg was forced in April 1930 to temporarily vote for the &quot;presidential government&quot; of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning that he was otherwise opposed to, in order to prevent the entire rural wing of the DNVP from seceding over the issue of tariffs, Hitler accused Hugenberg of weakness, and terminated the NSDAP&#x27;s co-operation with the DNVP.
Reflecting the changed political dynamics caused by the Young Plan referendum, in the election of 14 September 1930 the DNVP&#x27;s share of the vote dropped dramatically to 7% while the NSDAP&#x27;s share rose up equally dramatically to 18% (compared to the NSDAP&#x27;s 2.6% of the vote in 1928). This marked the NSDAP&#x27;s electoral breakthrough to the mainstream. Since the NSDAP did very well in areas that had traditionally voted for the DNVP like East Prussia and Pomerania, the German historian Martin Broszat wrote that would strongly suggest that most of the DNVP voters had deserted their old party for the NSDAP. Broszat argued that what happened between 1929 and 1932 was that the supporters of the radical right-wing DNVP had abandoned it for the even more radical right-wing NSDAP. Hugenberg had decided to use as his next wedge issue to destroy the middle-of-the-road parties that supported the Weimar Republic the theme of anti-Marxism (in the Weimar Republic the term Marxism was to describe both the SPD and the KPD). The media mogul Hugenberg used his vast press empire to wage a hysterical campaign warning his papers&#x27; mostly middle-class readers that Marxist SPD and KPD were going to mobilize the millions of unemployed created by the Great Depression to stage a bloody revolution and that only an authoritarian regime willing to use the most drastic means could save Germany. The Comintern&#x27;s Third Period, which meant that the Communists spent most of their time attacking the Social Democrats as &quot;social fascists&quot; was not reported by the Hugenberg press, which instead portrayed the KPD and the SPD as working together for a revolution. The Hugenberg papers argued that only the DNVP could save Germany from revolution, and that democracy and civil liberties were major impediments to battling the supposed Marxist revolution that was just on the verge of happening. The major beneficiaries of the Hugenberg press&#x27;s anti-Marxist campaign were not the DNVP as intended, but rather the National Socialists who were able to portray themselves as the most effective anti-Marxist fighting force.

The DNVP was declining rapidly as many workers and peasants began to support the more populist and less aristocratic NSDAP while upper-class and middle-class DNVP voters supported the NSDAP as the &quot;party of order&quot; best able to crush Marxism. Hugenberg pursued with a vengeance those DNVP deputies who left to form the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, whom Hugenberg called Weimar-supporting &quot;Tory democrats&quot; (democrat being a term of abuse for Hugenberg) who he believed practiced a watered down conservatism along the line of the British Conservative Party without any &quot;völkisch&quot; or monarchist convictions. Hugenberg&#x27;s vendetta against the Conservatives meant that he focused most of his time on attacking them in the 1930 election, sending the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; in to disturb speeches by Westarp and spent little time defending the DNVP against the attacks of the NSDAP. During the 1930 election, the DNVP issued a statement proclaiming that there were no important differences between them and the NSDAP on the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, arguing that the few differences that did exist concerned a small number of the &quot;radical demands of the NSDAP&quot; which were &quot;hardly important since in practice they cannot be implemented&quot;.
Despite the bitterness caused by the 1930 election, in February 1931 Hugenberg met with Hitler to discuss common co-operation on a referendum for early elections in Prussia that were intended to defeat the government of the Social Democrat Otto Braun, and thereby allow a NSDAP/DNVP coalition to win the resulting elections. As part of their efforts to co-operate, the NSDAP and the DNVP MdRs walked out of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on 11 February 1931 to protest the high-handed ways of the Brüning government. During the summer of 1931, the DNVP, the NSDAP and the KPD all joined forces in campaigning for a yes vote in the Prussian referendum, which led the liberal &quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot; newspaper to write of an alliance of &quot;the swastika and the Soviet star&quot; who were engaging in &quot;Katastrophenpolitik&quot;. Despite their vehemently expressed anti-communism both the DNVP and the NSDAP were prepared to co-operate with the Communists when it suited their purposes as in the case of the Prussian referendum. Hugenberg argued that Prussian referendum was necessary to force out the Braun government whom he accused of responsibility for &quot;the decline in the German economy, the bad state of the finances and the chaos in governance&quot;. On 9 August 1931 when the Prussian referendum was held, the NSDAP, DNVP and the KPD failed in their effort to force an early election in Prussia with yes side winning 37% of the vote.

In its September 1931 platform adopted at a convention in Stettin laying out the party&#x27;s principles, it was stated as follows:
Only a strong German nationality that consciously preserves its nature and essence and keeps itself free of foreign influence can provide the foundation for a strong German state. For that reason we resist the undermining, un-German spirit in all forms, whether it stems from Jewish or other circles. We are emphatically opposed to the prevalence of Judaism in the government and public life, which has emerged ever more ominously since the revolution. The flow of foreigners across our borders is to be prohibited.

The same platform called for the &quot;liberation of Germany&quot; (i.e. doing away with the Treaty of Versailles), restoring the monarchy under the Hohenzollern family, a return to the policy of pre-1914 navalism in order to make Germany a world power, a &quot;strong state&quot; to combat the Great Depression and a &quot;moral rebirth of our people&quot; by the &quot;deepening of Christian awareness&quot;.
On 11 October 1931, the DNVP, the NSDAP, the Pan-German League, the &quot;Reichslandbund&quot;, the German People&#x27;s Party and the Stahlhelm paramilitary organisation briefly formed an uneasy alliance known as the &quot;Harzburg Front&quot;. Attending the Bad Harzburg rally were most of the figures of the German right ranging from General Hans von Seeckt, Heinrich Class, Franz Seldte, General Walther von Lüttwitz, Admiral Adolf von Trotha, the economist Hjalmar Schacht, Crown Prince Wilhelm, Admiral Magnus von Levetzow, Prince Oskar of Prussia, Prince Eitel Friedrich, and on to figures such as Hugenberg and Hitler. The Harzburger Front was Hugenberg&#x27;s attempt to create on a more institutional basis the &quot;Reichsausschuß&quot; of 1929, and under his leadership, thereby form the &quot;national bloc&quot; that he confidently believed would sweep him into power in the near-future. Wheeler-Bennett called the Harzburg rally &quot;the formal declaration of war by the parties of the Right against the Brüning government-a concentration of all the forces of reaction, both past and present, in one great demonstration of hostility to the Weimar System&quot;. At the meetings to work out a policy platform for the Harzburger Front, the German historian Karl Dietrich Bracher wrote that Hugenberg made concessions to his partners in the front &quot;with the indulgence born of assured arrogance that is fed by the certainty of being in command&quot;.

The DNVP hoped to control the NSDAP through this coalition and to curb the Nazis&#x27; extremism, but the pact only served to strengthen the NSDAP by giving it access to funding and political respectability while obscuring the DNVP&#x27;s own less extreme platform. The Harzburger Front proved to be a failure, and by the end of 1931 the National Socialists were increasingly lashing out against their nominal allies. In February 1932 over the course of long talks, the DNVP and the NSDAP failed to agree on a common candidate for the presidential elections, and on 17 February 1932 Hitler unilaterally announced in a press release that he was running for president. This action effectively destroyed the Harzburger Front as Hugenberg had not been consulted before-hand. Hugenberg had much difficulty in recruiting a DVNP candidate for the presidential election as Prince Oskar of Prussia, the industrialist Albert Vögler, and General Otto vow Below all declined to run. Theodor Duesterberg was recruited as the DNVP presidential candidate more by default as he was the only one willing to run for the DNVP. In the first round of the presidential election on 13 March 1932, the DNVP supported Theodor Duesterberg, and after he withdrew from the race following his dreadful showing, endorsed no candidate for the second round on 10 April 1932. In the first round of the election, Duesterberg won only 6.8% of the vote compared to 30% of the vote won by Hitler while Hindenburg won 49.6% of the vote.
In June 1932, the DNVP became the only significant party to support Franz von Papen in his short tenure as Chancellor. Hugenberg wanted to join von Papen&#x27;s government, but was vetoed by President von Hindenburg who disliked Hugenberg. However, the two DNVP men who did serve in von Papen&#x27;s government, namely Baron Wilhelm von Gayl as Interior minister and Franz Gürtner as Justice Minister, where both were noted for their hostility to democracy and support for authoritarianism. The first act of the von Papen government was to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot; two years into its mandate. In a speech on 26 June 1932, Hugenberg designated the Nazis as now being an opponent of the national front. One of the DNVP&#x27;s members, Count Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin wrote a pamphlet for the election entitled &quot;Der Nationalsozialismus – eine Gefahr&quot; (&quot;National Socialism—A Menace&quot;) that attacked the NSDAP for the neo-paganism of one of its members, Alfred Rosenberg, and urged voters to choose the DNVP. At the same time, the NSDAP ridiculed the DNVP as the party of monarchist reactionaries without a clue as to how to deal with the Great Depression and who cared only for the rich. On 20 July 1932, during the run-up to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 31 June, the von Papen government carried out the &quot;Preußenschlag&quot;, a coup by which the &quot;Reich&quot; government deposed the SPD-dominated Prussian government of Otto Braun, usurping it by making Papen the &quot;Reich Commissar&quot; of Prussia. Baron von Gayl, the DNVP Interior Minister played a key role in planning the &quot;Rape of Prussia&quot; together with Chancellor von Papen and the Defense Minister General Kurt von Schleicher as part of the move towards authoritarian government by destroying one of the strongest pillars of democracy in Germany. In this way, the DNVP finally achieved its long sought goal of removing the Braun government.

In the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 31 July 1932, the DNVP posted its worst result ever, winning only 5.9% of the vote while the NSDAP won 37%. On 12 September 1932 the DNVP and the DVP were the only parties to vote for the von Papen government when it was defeated on a massive motion of no confidence in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. In response to losing the motion von Papen dissolved the &quot;Reichstag&quot; again. In the elections in fall of 1932 the DNVP made overtures to the NSDAP attempting to reform the Harzburg front. The German historian Hermann Beck wrote that the election in the autumn 1932 was the &quot;absolute nadir&quot; of DNVP-NSDAP relations when Hitler had decided to make the DNVP the main target in the election. The National Socialist newspaper &quot;Der Angriff&quot; in an editorial written by Joseph Goebbels called for a &quot;Reckoning with the &quot;Hugenzwerg&quot;&quot; (a portmanteau of Hugenberg and &quot;pygmy&quot;), and dismissively commented that Hugenberg must be a magician since there was no other way that he could hope to &quot;turn an insignificant heap of reactionaries&quot; into a mass movement. DNVP election meetings were the targets of Nazi stink bombs and heckling while the DNVP politician Countess Helene von Watter was threatened with a beating by Nazis. Another DNVP politician (Theodor Duesterberg) was heckled with shouts of &quot;Jew boy!&quot; while Baron Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven of the DNVP was accused of high treason for having allegedly fought against Germany as an Imperial Russian Army officer in World War I. Goebbels organized a boycott of the Scherl newspapers and press owned by Hugenberg while encouraged a strike at the Scherel press.&quot;. At a debate at the Berlin Sports Palace between Goebbels and Hugenberg&#x27;s right-hand man, Otto Schmidt-Hanover, thousands of Nazis showed up to boo Schmidt-Hanover and cheer on Goebbels; who won the debate by being the only one allowed to speak for any length of time. Leopold wrote that; &quot;the DNVP was rooted in the attitudes and traditions of the nineteenth century. It comprised men of property and education who patronized inferiors while scorning democratic idealism and loathing socialistic egalitarianism. Older men raised in the prewar era of peace and prosperity, the German Nationals identified their superiority as social, intellectual and racial. Hugenberg himself typified their Pan-German idealism and expansionism. Hitler and the Nazis were products of the twentieth century. Alienated and deprived, inured by the hardships of the war, the frustrations of inflation, and the humiliation of the depression, these were men of action. No Spenglerian historicizing for them; power was the goal&quot;. Despite this, the conflict between the Nazis and the Left Wing parties was much more intense.

&quot;Gauleiter&quot; Wilhelm Kube—who himself had once belonged to the DNVP in the years 1919–23—called in a speech to &quot;fight the DNVP to the death&quot;. Hugenberg&#x27;s main line of attack on the NSDAP in the fall of 1932 was that Germany&#x27;s chief danger was &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and there was no difference between the &quot;red Bolshevism&quot; of the KPD and the &quot;brown Bolshevism&quot; of the NSDAP. In October 1932, the NSDAP had lost some middle-class backing when it came out in support of a strike by transport workers in Berlin, which also happened to be supported by the KPD, Goebbels reasoned that this was necessary as support from conservative aristocrats could be won back, but they would lose what little sway the Nazi party had on working-class Berlin if they didn&#x27;t support the strike. In the election on 6 November 1932, the DNVP made a small improvement over its dismal showing in July, winning 8.3% of the vote, a gain made entirely at the expense of the NSDAP. Despite all the bitterness of the election battles of 1932 Hugenberg cautiously opened talks with Hitler in December 1932 with the aim of reviving the Harzburger Front of 1931. This was a reflection of the fact that it was now very hard to imagine that the DNVP could come to power without the NSDAP.

=== Bringing Hitler to power, January 1933 ===
On 3 January 1933, Hitler and Von Papen had what was supposed to be a secret meeting that however was revealed by the press. Hugenberg was aware at least in general that Hitler and Von Papen were having talks on forming a new government, but was uncertain about just what exactly was happening, and did not want to see Hitler as Chancellor. In January 1933, upset that the government of General Kurt von Schleicher failed to heed its promise to raise tariffs on agriculture imports, the Agricultural League issued on 11 January 1933 a vehement press release calling Schleicher &quot;the tool of the almighty money-bag interests of internationally oriented export industry and its satellites&quot; and accused Schleicher of &quot;an indifference to the impoverishment of agriculture beyond the capacity of even a purely Marxist regime&quot;. The statement attacking Schleicher was issued by the Agrarian League, not the DNVP, but as the Agrarian League was a powerful pressure group within the DNVP, the statement effectively forced the DNVP to oppose the Schleicher government and thus severely limited Hugenberg&#x27;s options. On 13 January, Schleicher met with Hugenberg and offered him the chance to serve as minister of agriculture and economics, an offer that Hugenberg said he was willing to accept only if Schleicher would end his efforts to secure the support of the &quot;Zentrum&quot;, a demand that proved unacceptable. Knowing that Hitler and Von Papen were discussing a new government, and hoping for a chance to join the proposed government even through he was not quite certain who was to head it, Hugenberg decided on 21 January 1933 to send the DNVP MP Otto Schmidt-Hanover to inform General Schleicher that the DNVP was opposed to his government because of his supposed indifference to the suffering of German farmers, and it would vote for a motion of no confidence once the &quot;Reichstag&quot; reconvened at the end of January. By this move, Hugenberg hoped that this would lead to the DNVP joining the proposed &quot;Government of National Concentration&quot;, even though he did not know who the Chancellor was going to be. Hugenberg&#x27;s major fear in January 1933 was that Hitler and Von Papen might form the &quot;Government of National Concentration&quot; without the DNVP, and he was determined that if such a government be created that he be part of it. The American historian Henry Ashby Turner wrote that Hugenberg was driven in January 1933 by &quot;...opportunistic considerations...a desperate desire to gain a measure of power as he approached the end of a frustrating political career&quot;.

Hugenberg himself wanted Von Papen to return to power, but found that was not an option in late January 1933 as Von Papen had abandoned his demand to once more be Chancellor on 19 January 1933 and was now supporting Hitler as Chancellor. Faced with this situation, Hugenberg decided that the best that could be hoped for was to support Hitler as Chancellor while seeking to &quot;neutralize&quot; the Nazis by imposing restrictions on a Hitler government that would limit its freedom of action. At a secret meeting at Joachim von Ribbentrop&#x27;s house on 24 January 1933 attended by Hermann Göring, Wilhelm Frick, Ribbentrop and Von Papen, they worked out the plan that the best way of overcoming President von Hindenburg&#x27;s opposition to appointing Hitler Chancellor was by creating a right-wing &quot;government of national concentration&quot; that would ensure the Chancellorship went to Hitler while giving the impression that Hitler&#x27;s power would be limited by creating a coalition government of all the German right. From this viewpoint, it was important to include the DNVP in the proposed Hitler government as a way of reassuring Hindenburg. At the same time, Hindenburg was visited by his friend and neighbor in East Prussia, the DNVP politician Count Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, the grand old man of German conservatism and the leader of the DNVP&#x27;s extreme right-wing &quot;Junker&quot; fraction, who told the President that he should appoint Hitler chancellor and that his fears about what Hitler might do as Chancellor were groundless. As Hindenburg valued Oldenburg-Januschau&#x27;s advice, his opinion helped to weaken Hindenburg&#x27;s resistance to appointing Hitler chancellor.

On 27 January 1933, Ribbentrop invited Hugenberg to a secret meeting at his house in an attempt to win his participation in the proposed &quot;government of national concentration.&quot; Hugenberg had nearly scuttled Hitler&#x27;s chances of getting the Chancellorship when he objected to Hitler&#x27;s proposed Cabinet line-up; complaining that too many portfolios went to the Nazis and not enough to the DNVP. On 28 January, Von Papen met with Hugenberg and informed him that he must drop his objections to National Socialists serving as the &quot;Reich&quot; and Prussian ministries of the Interior (the latter controlled the Prussian police), in exchange for which Von Papen promised Hugenberg that he could have his wish to be &quot;economic dictator&quot; by being given the &quot;Reich&quot;/Prussian ministries of economics and agriculture. On 29 January 1933, Hugenberg&#x27;s aide Reinhold Quaatz wrote in his diary the following:

Within the party the ultimatum [to Schleicher] had come as an act of deliverance. With a single blow we stood at the center of events as a sort of pivot; this position however is correspondingly dangerous. If we go with Hitler, we must harness him. Otherwise we are finished, whether he succeeds in grabbing power for himself or if he fails. If a Hitler government does not come about, then Von Papen, Meissner, perhaps even Hindenburg [...] will try to hang the blame on us. We must also prevent a Hitler-Centre coalition, but also avoid a complete falling out with the Centre. It&#x27;s a game of Russian roulette with five bullets. Fortunately, all the others are dependent on us. &quot;Qui vivra, verra.&quot;

The (entirely baseless) fear that Hitler might try to form a coalition with the &quot;Zentrum&quot; which would give him a majority in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and thereby allow a dictatorship without the DNVP was the final reason why Hugenberg decided to join the Hitler government.

=== In the Hitler government ===
Performing badly in subsequent elections, the party chose to be a junior coalition partner to the NSDAP in the so-called, short-lived &quot;Regierung der nationalen Konzentration&quot; (Government of National Concentration) upon Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor in 1933. Although Hugenberg had severe doubts about Hitler as Chancellor he agreed to serve in a Hitler government provided that he was made &quot;economic dictator&quot; by being appointed Minister of Economics and Agriculture on both the &quot;Reich&quot; and Prussian levels. He was one of eight ministers in the government that were either members of the DNVP or were backed by it. The Nazis were limited to three seats in cabinet, and only two with portfolios—the chancellorship for Hitler and the then-powerless Interior Ministry for Frick (Göring was a minister without portfolio). The cabinet&#x27;s makeup was conceived by Von Papen and Hindenburg in hopes of keeping Hitler in check and making him their puppet. On the morning of 30 January 1933 when the Hitler cabinet was going to be sworn in by President von Hindenburg, just minutes before the ceremony was going to be performed, a major dispute arouse between Hitler and the cantankerous, bad-tempered Hugenberg when the latter learned that Hitler was going to violate his promise not to call early elections, and was planning on dissolving the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as soon as possible. The shouting match between the two men delayed the swearing in of the cabinet and was only finally mediated by Presidential state secretary Otto Meissner who warned Hitler and Hugenberg that Hindenburg would not wait forever and by Von Papen who told Hugenberg that he should never doubt the word of a fellow German.

On 30 January 1933 Hugenberg was sworn in by Hindenburg to serve in Hitler&#x27;s government as Economics and Agriculture minister as he had requested. During his time in Hitler&#x27;s cabinet Hugenberg did not stand in the way of Hitler&#x27;s efforts to make himself a dictator. As mentioned above, many prominent DNVP members had long favoured scrapping Weimar&#x27;s democracy in favour of an authoritarian system. After the Reichstag fire, Hugenberg gave a speech that spoke of the necessity for &quot;draconic measures&quot; and of &quot;exterminating the hotbeds in which Bolshevism can flourish&quot;. Hugenberg argued that &quot;in these earnest times there can no longer be any half-measures...no compromise, no cowardice&quot;. At a Cabinet meeting Hugenberg together with the other DNVP cabinet ministers voted for the Reichstag Fire Decree, which effectively wiped out civil liberties. The decree was based largely on a proposal by Ludwig Grauert, a DNVP member who had recently been named chief of the Prussian state police, to provide legal cover for the mass arrests of Communists on the night of the fire. On the afternoon of 27 February—hours before the fire—Gürtner had submitted a draft decree which, like the Reichstag Fire Decree, would have imposed draconian restrictions on civil liberties in the name of curbing Communist violence. One of the few DNVP members who protested against participation in the Hitler government was Count Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin who sent Hugenberg a letter on 13 February 1933 resigning from the party in protest against the coalition with the Nazis.

On 23 March 1933, the entire DNVP &quot;Reichstag&quot; delegation voted for the Enabling Act, which gave the Cabinet the power to make laws without parliamentary consent, effectively making Hitler a dictator. Many Communist and Socialist representatives were unable to vote, being held in Nazi-organized holding camps at the time of the vote. 
In early May 1933, the DNVP changed its name to the German National Front (DNF), a name change that Hugenberg argued was to better reflect the fact that the era of political parties was coming to a close in Germany. In his capacity as &quot;economic dictator&quot;, Hugenberg named as State Secretary at the Economics Ministry Paul Bang, a man mostly noted for his &quot;autarkic ideals and racist fanaticism&quot; who managed to annoy industry with his strongly protectionist tendencies. During his short time as &quot;Reich&quot;/Prussian Economics and Agriculture Minister, Hugenberg worked to achieve autarky by keeping foreign products out of the German market, for various grandiose schemes for government subsidies for struggling farmers and government schemes to reduce farmers&#x27; debts. Most of these actions clashed with more populist plans of the National Socialists. The DNF, though it expressed certain reservations that the wave of anti-Semitic violence waged by the SA in the spring of 1933 was threatening the rule of law, supported all of the anti-Semitic laws brought in by the new government. As a group the DNF favored the sort of legalised, bureaucratic anti-Semitic discrimination expressed in the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. It found the sort of lawless anti-Semitic violence waged by the SA distasteful, even if the party rarely condemned that violence (by this time the more violent anti-Semites within the DNVP had long since left for the NSDAP, leaving only those who preferred legalised anti-Semitism). One of the very few examples of someone formally associated with the DNVP intervening against anti-Semitic violence occurred on 1 April 1933, the day of nationwide anti-Jewish boycott, when the Lord Mayor of Leipzig, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, personally ordered the SA to stop enforcing the boycott. Goerdeler had been one of the rising stars of the DNVP in the 1920s, but in December 1931 he had been offered and accepted the post of Price Commissioner by &quot;Zentrum&quot; Chancellor Heinrich Brüning. Hugenberg had forbidden Goerdeler from accepting the office, which led to Goerdeler resigning from the DNVP rather than being expelled.

Hitler&#x27;s patience with his conservative allies was limited, and it quickly ran out after the passage of the Enabling Act. By voting for it the DNF had served its purpose as far as Hitler was concerned and he had no further need for it. From the spring onward the Nazis started to increasingly attack their allies. In March 1933, DVNP leaders in Frankfurt, Hanover and Kiel were complaining that the police and SA were harassing them. Herbert von Bismarck, the leader of Bismarck Youth, the DVNP&#x27;s youth wing, was harassed so much that he resigned from his post in the Prussian Interior ministry. In May 1933 a massive press campaign was started by the National Socialist newspapers demanding that Hugenberg resign from the Cabinet. By May 1933, in the Free City of Danzig, the local branch of the NSDAP had turned on the Danzig branch of the DNVP, joining a coalition with the Danzig branch of the &quot;Zentrum&quot; in the Danzig Senate. The way that the Nazi-dominated government of Danzig was starting to persecute those civil servants who were DNVP members who refused to join the NSDAP was from Hugenberg&#x27;s viewpoint an ominous precedent.

In addition, Hugenberg, who had headed the German delegation at the London Economic Conference in June 1933 put forth a programme of German colonial expansion in both Africa and Eastern Europe as the best way of ending the Great Depression, which created a major storm at the conference. Before leaving for London Hugenberg had objected to a speech by the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath where Neurath had said about the London conference: &quot;The National Socialist government has shown it is willing to work together with other nations in the political arena. It is in this spirit that it approaches the World Economic Conference.&quot; Hugenberg objected to Neurath&#x27;s speech under the grounds that he was not going to London to work for &quot;harmonious understanding&quot; between nations, but rather he was seeking to assert German interests in the most aggressive manner possible. Besides his sincere belief that Germany needed an empire in Africa and Eastern Europe to recover from the Great Depression, Hugenberg&#x27;s major reason for putting forth his imperialist programme at the London Economic Conference was that by late May 1933 the DNF was being increasingly persecuted by its nominal Nazi allies, and Hugenberg believed that if he could score an outstanding success in foreign policy, then Hitler would end the persecution of his party. Hugenberg believed that the case for German imperialism as a way of ending the Great Depression not just in Germany, but all over the world was so compelling that he could convert the other delegates at World Economic Conference to his way of thinking. On 16 June 1933 Hugenberg released the &quot;Hugenberg memorandum&quot; to the press in London, and set off a media storm. The Soviet government put forth a diplomatic note protesting against Hugenberg&#x27;s idea that the Soviet Union was a backward country ripe for German colonization, while the British and French governments protested against Hugenberg&#x27;s demand that they should just hand over all their colonies in Africa to Germany. The leaders of the rest of the German delegation in London comprising Neurath, the Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht and the Finance minister Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk had not been consulted about the &quot;Hugenberg Memorandum&quot; and felt Hugenberg&#x27;s approach to foreign policy had made him into an embarrassment.

Hugenberg had made himself into an embarrassment for the new regime by being indiscreet enough to advance the claim to Germany&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) at a time when Germany was still more or less disarmed, which forced Hitler to disavow his statements in London. The Foreign Minister Baron von Neurath attempted to contain the damage caused by the &quot;Hugenberg Memorandum&quot; by issuing a press statement that Hugenberg&#x27;s views were his own, not those of the German government, which led Hugenberg to give an interview with the press in London during which he stated that his views were those of the government and he called Neurath&#x27;s press release false. In its turn, Hugenberg&#x27;s interview prompted a further press release from the Foreign Office saying that Hugenberg was not speaking for the government as he claimed he was. After his return to Berlin, at a Cabinet meeting on 23 June, Hugenberg insisted on having a confrontation with Neurath over his press releases that greatly alienated the other non-Nazi members of the cabinet such as Vice-Chancellor Von Papen, finance minister Von Krosigk and Reichsbank president Schacht who all sided with Neurath. By pursuing his dispute with Neurath instead of dropping the issue as the non-Nazi ministers had urged him to do, Hugenberg had lost his last allies against the Nazi assault on the DNF.
Shortly thereafter, DNF members were either intimidated into joining the NSDAP or retiring from political life altogether. On 21 June, the police and the SA raided and shut down the DNF&#x27;s youth wing offices under the grounds that they had been infiltrated by Communists. This led to furious, but futile protests by youth wing&#x27;s director Admiral Adolf von Trotha asking for help from President Hindenburg while declaring his loyalty to the &quot;national revolution&quot; and the new regime. Unknown to Hugenberg and acting on the initiative of the party executive, Baron Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven had opened talks with the Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick in late June 1933 on what terms the DNF might best dissolve itself. On 27 June 1933 Hugenberg resigned from the government under the grounds he did not have any power and that attacks by the National Socialists on his party had made his position untenable. Under growing Nazi pressure the party dissolved itself in June 1933, and a month later the Nazi Party was declared to be the only legally permitted party in Germany. One of DNF&#x27;s conditions for dissolving itself was the promise that all DNF members in the Reichstag, the civil service, and the police be allowed to continue with their jobs and that the rest of the DNF membership be left in peace, a promise that Hitler put into writing. The German historian Hermann Beck wrote that promise was one that Hitler &quot;...kept with astonishing reliability&quot;. The National Socialist newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; in an editorial on the demise of the DNF on 30 June praised Hugenberg as a fighter against the Young Plan, and called him a &quot;tragic personality&quot;. Some of its now-former members, such as Franz Gürtner and Franz Seldte, stayed in the Hitler cabinet for years afterward and eventually joined the Nazi Party. Others, including Hugenberg, remained in the Reichstag as &quot;guests&quot; of the Nazis. Several prominent Nazis such as Hans Lammers, Friedrich Jeckeln, Erwin Bumke, Julius Lippert, Dietrich Klagges, Paul Giesler, Richard Kunze, Kurt Blome, Herbert von Dirksen, Ludwig Münchmeyer, Erich Neumann, Friedrich Hildebrandt, Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck, Leonardo Conti, Karl von Eberstein, Albert Brackmann, Walter Buch and Wilhelm Kube began their careers in the DNVP, as did the Nazi martyr Horst Wessel.

Several prominent former DNVP members were involved in the 20 July plot against Hitler in 1944. One of the leaders, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, would have been Chancellor had the plot succeeded. Another, Ulrich von Hassell was considered to be a potential foreign minister in Goerdeler&#x27;s government. Other former DNVP members executed after 20 July plot included Ferdinand von Lüninck, Walter Cramer, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, and Paul Lejeune-Jung while Ewald Loeser was imprisoned. Many of the DNVP men who were involved in the 20 July plot had in some way served the Nazi regime in the 1930s with Goerdeler staying on as mayor of Leipzig until 1937 and working as Price Commissioner in 1934–1935, Hassell serving as ambassador to Italy until 1938, and von Lüninck serving Oberpräsident of Westphalia until 1938 and as an Army officer during the war.

=== Post-war ===
In post-war Germany, no serious attempt was made to recreate the party as a political force when conservative and centrist forces united into bigger parties like the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian ally. Former DNVP members in the CDU claimed to have undergone &quot;inner change&quot;, but had difficulties being accepted by some of their party colleagues who had belonged to the Catholic Centre Party during the Weimar period. In accounts of its own history and origins, the CDU tended to downplay its DNVP roots, while stressing its continuities from the Centre Party and the small Protestant Christian Social People&#x27;s Service. Among the most prominent former DNVP members in the CDU were Robert Lehr (federal minister of the interior, 1950–53), Hans Schlange-Schöningen (Reich&#x27;s minister 1931–32) and Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck.

A direct ideological successor of the DNVP was the tiny national-conservative and authoritarian-monarchist German Conservative Party – German Right Party (DKP-DRP), including former DNVP members like Reinhold Wulle, Eldor Borck, Wilhelm Jaeger and Otto Schmidt-Hannover, but also attracting former Nazis. Active only in Northern and Northwestern Germany, it won 1.8% of the votes and five seats in the first &quot;Bundestag&quot; election of 1949. Former DNVP members were also present in the Hanover-based German Party and the short-lived National Democratic Party (NDP) that was only active in Hesse. A federation of the three hard-right parties DKP-DRP, DP and NDP was prohibited by the Allied occupation authorities in 1949, but in 1950 DKP-DRP and NDP merged into the Deutsche Reichspartei (DRP), which enjoyed temporary representation in a few states&#x27; parliaments. The DNVP was briefly revived in 1962 as a tiny splinter party, but the new DNVP soon afterwards was merged into the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), among whose co-leaders was former DNVP member Heinrich Fassbender.

In his book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, journalist and historian William Shirer wrote that the DNVP&#x27;s status as a far-right party rather than a mainstream conservative party was one of the main reasons for the Weimar Republic&#x27;s downfall. In Shirer&#x27;s view, the DNVP&#x27;s refusal to &quot;take a responsible position either in the government or in the opposition&quot; during most of Weimar&#x27;s existence denied Weimar &quot;that stability provided in many other countries by a truly conservative party.&quot; Along similar lines, conservative British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett wrote about in his book &quot;The Nemesis of Power&quot; about the DNVP the following:

Had the German Conservatives reconciled themselves to the Republic—bringing to it that wealth of experience and knowledge which they had accumulated in the past, and performing those invaluable services which are always fulfilled in the government of any country by an able constitutional Opposition, ready to take office should the occasion arise—they would have conferred a considerable benefit not only upon Germany—to whom they would have given that which she had so long lacked, a genuine Conservative Party—but also upon the cause of Conservatism throughout the world. They did not do this. Under the cloak of loyalty to the Monarchy, they either held aloof or sabotaged the efforts of successive Chancellors to give a stable government to the Republic. The truth is that after 1918 many German Nationalists were more influenced by feelings of disloyalty to the Republic than of loyalty to the Kaiser, and it was this motive which led them to make their fatal contribution to bringing Hitler to power. The sequel is to be found in the long list of noble names among those executed after the &quot;Putsch&quot; of July 20, 1944, when many expiated upon the scaffold the sins which they or their fathers had committed a generation earlier.

<doc id="405672" wikidata="Q1319893" url="?curid=405672" title="Valencia, Santa Clarita, California">
<text>Valencia is a neighborhood in Santa Clarita located within Los Angeles County, California. It is one of the four unincorporated communities (along with Saugus, Newhall, and Canyon Country) that merged to create the city of Santa Clarita in 1987. It is situated in the western part of Santa Clarita, stretching from Lyons Avenue to the south (on the border with Newhall) to north of Copper Hill Drive, and from Interstate 5 east to Bouquet Canyon and Seco Canyon Roads. Valencia was founded as a master-planned community with the first development, Old Orchard I, built on Lyons Avenue behind Old Orchard Elementary School.

==History==
In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, the first Europeans to see inland areas of California, came up and over the pass from the San Fernando Valley and camped near the river on August 8–9. They found a large native village there and witnessed a wedding celebration. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, named the river &quot;Santa Clara&quot; and noted in his diary that the place would be a good location for a mission. On the return trip, however, the party found a less strenuous trail through the Conejo Valley. Later travelers also preferred that route, and Mission San Fernando Rey de España was established down in the valley.

The master-planned portion of Valencia was first planned in the 1960s by the Newhall Land and Farming Company. The first subdivision to be constructed in Valencia was Old Orchard I, which opened in 1967, occupying an area bounded by Lyons Avenue, Orchard Village Road, and the South Fork of the Santa Clara River. The next subdivisions to open were Old Orchard II and Valencia Hills. Development continues to the present day and is nearing completion. Valencia is notable for its landscaped boulevards connecting a mix of apartment buildings, single-family detached homes, shopping centers, office parks and industrial warehouses.

On November 30, 2013, Paul Walker, best known for playing Brian O&#x27;Conner in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; films, died in a car crash in Hercules Street, Valencia. Following Walker&#x27;s death, Hercules Street became a known attraction for people to engage in car drifting.

==Community==
Valencia is located along Interstate 5; all incorporated portions of Valencia are east of the freeway, while unincorporated portions are west of the freeway. Tesoro del Valle, the northernmost subdivision of Valencia, is outside the city limits although it is east of Interstate 5 and within the city&#x27;s sphere of influence.

Valencia&#x27;s residential areas are separated into villages, each with its own lifestyle (see List of Valencia, California residential villages). Almost all of Valencia&#x27;s villages are close to schools, shopping, and other amenities. In many of the villages, homeowner associations oversee the quality and upkeep of housing developments ranging in size from a few dozen homes to over a thousand. Many villages also have a neighborhood watch program in force.

The major north–south thoroughfare in Valencia is McBean Parkway, which runs from Copper Hill Drive in the north to Stevenson Ranch in the southwest where it becomes Stevenson Ranch Parkway. McBean Parkway passes by such landmarks as Chesebrough, Heritage, and Summit Parks, Bridgeport Lake; Hyatt Regency Valencia; Westfield Valencia Town Center; Santa Clarita Valley Medical Plaza; Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital; and the California Institute of the Arts. Major east-west thoroughfares in Valencia (from north to south) include Copper Hill Drive, Decoro Drive, Newhall Ranch Road, Rye Canyon Road, Magic Mountain Parkway, Valencia Boulevard, McBean Parkway (which runs east–west from Orchard Village Road to I-5), Wiley Canyon Road, and Lyons Avenue.

Valencia contains most of the city&#x27;s government buildings, hotels, car dealerships, medical centers, and corporate headquarters (see Economy section below). Eleven of the city&#x27;s twelve tallest buildings are in Valencia; the two tallest are 24305 Town Center Drive (headquarters of Princess Cruises) and the Hyatt Regency Valencia, both of which are tall. The Santa Clarita city hall is located in Valencia, at 23920 Valencia Boulevard.

Valencia also has a system of paved pathways over or under the streets and boulevards, which are called &quot;paseos&quot;. They connect the entire community, making it possible to travel throughout nearly all of Valencia on foot or by bicycle without crossing a street at grade level. The paseo network is connected to the Santa Clara River Trail which runs east along the Santa Clara River to Canyon Country.

Valencia is split between two ZIP codes: the northern and eastern portions are in 91354, and the southern and western portions are in 91355.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, the population of Valencia was 63,670. 54.2% of residents were non-Hispanic white, 21.1% were Hispanic, 19.2% were Asian American, 4.8% were African American, and 2.3% were Native American.

==Education==
At the elementary school level, northern Valencia is served by the Saugus Union School District, southern Valencia is served by the Newhall School District, and a small portion of western Valencia is served by the Castaic Union School District. The boundary between the Saugus and Newhall School Districts follows Valencia Boulevard (from The Old Road to Magic Mountain Parkway) and Magic Mountain Parkway (from Valencia Boulevard to Bouquet Canyon Road/Railroad Avenue).

Junior high and high school students in Valencia attend schools in the William S. Hart Union High School District. Valencia includes Rio Norte and Arroyo Seco Junior High Schools, and Valencia High School. Hart, Saugus, West Ranch, and Castaic High Schools; Placerita and Rancho Pico Junior High Schools; and Castaic Middle School also serve parts of Valencia. Castaic Middle School is part of the Castaic Union School District, not the Hart District.

Valencia is home to College of the Canyons, a community college, and California Institute of the Arts, an arts university.

==Attractions==
Six Flags Magic Mountain is located in unincorporated Valencia. It includes 20 roller coasters, the most of any amusement park in the world.

The Valencia Town Center shopping mall is the primary commercial center of Valencia. It occupies an area bounded by Valencia Boulevard to the south, McBean Parkway to the west, Magic Mountain Parkway to the north, and Citrus Street to the east. It includes over of retail space and contains 134 stores and 46 restaurants.

Valencia is home to an ice rink known as The Cube — Ice and Entertainment Center (formerly Ice Station Valencia). It is used for ice skating and hockey. In 2020, Ice Station Valencia was on the brink of permanent closure due to COVID-19, until the Santa Clarita city council unanimously voted to acquire the building for $14.2 million. On February 23, 2021, the city council sold Ice Station to American Sports Entertainment Company and the Los Angeles Kings. The city is currently in the process of renovating The Cube to include two large ice rinks (one NHL-size rink and one Olympic-sized rink) and one small ice rink known as The Pond. The rinks, covered with insulated floors, would double as venues for conventions, business meetings, concerts, birthday parties, and filming. The Cube opened on April 12, 2021, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Cube is located on Smyth Drive, across the street from Valencia High School.

==Economy==
Companies based in Valencia include Princess Cruises, Honda Performance Development, Precision Dynamics Corporation, condomman.com, Newhall Land and Farming Company, U.S. HealthWorks, and the American division of Advanced Bionics. Sunkist, Mechanix Wear, Remo, and WayForward are headquartered in unincorporated Valencia.

<doc id="405674" wikidata="Q339222" url="?curid=405674" title="Blast Corps">
<text>Blast Corps is an action game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The player uses vehicles to destroy buildings in the path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. In the game&#x27;s 57 levels, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed at the end of that year.

The game was Rare&#x27;s first game for the Nintendo 64. Its development team ranged between four and seven members, many of whom were recent graduates. The team sought to find gameplay to fit Rare co-founder Chris Stamper&#x27;s idea for a building destruction game. The puzzle game mechanics were inspired by those of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1994).

&quot;Blast Corps&quot; was released to critical acclaim and received Metacritic&#x27;s second highest Nintendo 64 game ratings of 1997. The game sold one million copies lower than the team&#x27;s expectations and received several editor&#x27;s choice awards. Reviewers praised its originality, variety, and graphics, but some criticized its controls and repetition. Reviewers of Rare&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Rare Replay&quot; retrospective compilation noted &quot;Blast Corps&quot; as a standout title.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Blast Corps&quot; is a single-player action video game. The player controls vehicles to destroy buildings, such as farms and other structures, in the path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the motorcycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and three different robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game&#x27;s puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.

The world is portrayed from a three-quarters overhead view. The player can adjust the game&#x27;s viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the player in the early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level&#x27;s timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By destroying any remaining structures, finding secrets, and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. Activating hidden communication points in each level will unlock various secret levels, where the player completes objectives against the clock, such as completing laps on a circuit or smashing specific objects. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. Completing every stage unlocks a time attack mode, in which players are awarded medals for clearing the carrier&#x27;s path in the fastest time. Earning every gold medal in the game will unlock a set of more difficult time attack goals for each level, for which players can earn platinum medals. There are no settings to change the game&#x27;s difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.

== Development ==
&quot;Blast Corps&quot; was among Rare&#x27;s first games for the Nintendo 64 and led a run of seven critically acclaimed Rare titles for the console. The game&#x27;s production began in 1995. The development team consisted of four recent graduates, though it expanded at times to seven concurrent staff. Martin Wakeley became the game&#x27;s lead designer. He credited the team&#x27;s small size for their easy progression from planning to market. Rare founder Chris Stamper was the impetus for the project. He had wanted to make a game about destroying buildings for years prior to &quot;Blast Corps&quot; development. The team worked to fit his idea to a gameplay concept and devised a &quot;Constantly Moving Object&quot; conceit that would give the levels a time limit. This idea became the nuclear missile carrier.

&quot;Retro Gamer&quot; credited Wakeley for &quot;Blast Corps&quot; idiosyncratic ideas and humor in light of the game&#x27;s serious premise. For instance, the &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; &quot;power slide&quot; drift mechanics inspired that of &quot;Blast Corps&quot; dump truck. Wakeley championed the drift controls against the rest of the team, who found them aggravating. The game&#x27;s lead artist, Ricky Berwick, had developed the vehicle concepts without consideration for their in-game function, and the vehicles were only later retrofitted to the gameplay. One of the robot vehicles was designed without an arm because the developers had run out of computer memory to store the data and liked the look anyway. Wakeley determined the game&#x27;s high score &quot;goal medal&quot; objectives, in which players would attempt to better a set completion time on each level. &quot;Blast Corps&quot; Japanese and American quality assurance teams later competed to push the levels to their limits, which resulted in the game&#x27;s platinum level objectives. Wakeley described these platinum challenges as &quot;just insane&quot; and said he could only finish four himself.

Wakeley saw &quot;Blast Corps&quot; as a puzzle game at its core. He was influenced by the 1994 &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, in which the player begins each level with all the tools they need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was &quot;Blast Corps&quot; core game mechanic. The &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; demo at Nintendo&#x27;s annual trade show in 1995 helped Wakeley envision how a true 3D world worked with the controller&#x27;s 3D analog stick. The team&#x27;s technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.

Nintendo published &quot;Blast Corps&quot; for their Nintendo 64. In its 1995 trade show preview, it was originally titled &quot;Blast Dozer&quot;, a name it retained for its Japanese release. (The team had considered other titles, including &quot;Heavy Duty Heroes&quot;, &quot;Blast Radius&quot;, and &quot;Power Dozer&quot;.) &quot;Blast Corps&quot; was first released in Japan on March 21, 1997, and in North America three days later. Its European and Australian release followed on December 22. The game had been in production for just over a year. To promote the game, a three-part comic detailing the game&#x27;s story was published in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; issues #97–99, later released as a graphic novel by Dark Horse Comics.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to review aggregator Metacritic, and &quot;unanimous critical success&quot;, according to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;. Reviewers highly praised the novelty and variety of &quot;Blast Corps&quot; gameplay. Peer Schneider of &quot;IGN&quot;, in particular, lauded the game&#x27;s originality. Trent Ward commented in &quot;GameSpot&quot; that the premise taps into childhood fantasies, while &quot;the unique relationship between the terrain and the vehicles you pilot ensures that &quot;Blast Corps&quot; will exercise your mind as well as your reflexes&quot;.

Reviewers struggled to master the game&#x27;s controls. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Slo Mo praised this aspect of the game, saying that even mastering the extreme precision of the steering is fun, and rewards the player with both better gameplay technique and an appreciation for the strong distinction between the game&#x27;s many vehicles. Schneider likewise overcame his initial concerns to appreciate the complexity of the controls and the differences between the vehicles. He considered the locked camera view restrictive when compared to the unrestricted 3D camera in the game&#x27;s contemporaries. Schneider thought the game should have been longer, with fewer bonus levels and more main missions, though he did appreciate the pacing, design, and difficulty of the included levels. Slo Mo instead asserted that &quot;Over 60 levels and hidden areas within hidden areas give you your money&#x27;s worth&quot;. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic agreed, asserting that the vast size of the levels and numerous secrets and bonus areas make &quot;Blast Corps&quot; &quot;one of the few Nintendo 64 games that justifies its exorbitant price tag&quot;. Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) thought the game was repetitive, as did &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;. The latter, though, praised &quot;Blast Corps&quot; level design and difficulty progression. Ward had fewer reservations, writing that &quot;basically what you have here is a game with great graphics, great sound, and a great premise. What&#x27;s even more impressive is that the game doesn&#x27;t really have any substantial flaws to speak of – unless you want to count lack of a two-player mode, which really isn&#x27;t fair.&quot; Crispin Boyer of &quot;EGM&quot; wrote that the game&#x27;s best feature was its &quot;palpable sense of suspense&quot; as the carrier advanced on resistant buildings.

Critics praised the game&#x27;s graphics and sound. Schneider found the game unpretentious in comparison to video game trends of photorealistic rendering and cartoonish art. He likened the slick vehicle animations and metallic elements to &quot;Micro Machines&quot; and Rare&#x27;s &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;. Schneider praised the game&#x27;s texture maps, which made the night scenes and houses look realistic, and the canyons breathtaking. He wrote that the game&#x27;s 3D programming was errorless, and was particularly pleased about the game&#x27;s lack of fog, usually used to cover developer limitations. &quot;EGM&quot; echoed Schneider&#x27;s praise of the deep landscapes, which Boyer called &quot;incredible&quot;. Scott McCall (&quot;AllGame&quot;) praised the game&#x27;s realistic polygonal models and technical prowess, and Steve Polak (&quot;The Weekend Australian&quot;) wrote that &quot;Blast Corps&quot; showcased the console&#x27;s graphics capabilities. Schneider described the soundtrack as between &quot;70s pop, disaster movie score, and Country Bear Jamboree&quot;. He praised the range of engine, tire screeching, and crashing sound effects. Reviewers disliked the country music tracks with jaw harp.

&quot;IGN&quot; wrote that &quot;Blast Corps&quot; exemplified qualities of enjoyable Nintendo Entertainment System and arcade games, while &quot;EGM&quot; considered the game unlike all others. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote that the game&#x27;s combination of puzzles and continuous destruction made the game so unique as to defy genre classification. The magazine described the gameplay concept of returning to explore without a time limit as &quot;a stroke of genius&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; thought of &quot;Blast Corps&quot; as a 3D successor to &quot;nail-biting reaction games&quot; such as &quot;Loco-Motion&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; agreed with a reader that &quot;Blast Corps&quot; was part of a &quot;Destroy&quot; subgenre including games like &quot;Desert Strike&quot;, &quot;Return Fire&quot;, and &quot;Body Harvest&quot;, and Matt Fox of &quot;The Video Games Guide&quot; put the game in a lineage with &quot;Highway Encounter&quot; and &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot;. Slo Mo said it was &quot;like &quot;Pilotwings&quot; with a kamikaze twist. It&#x27;s a multifaceted game that melds a slick vehicle sim and a mind-thumping action/strategy challenge with massive destructive force.&quot; Schneider said &quot;Blast Corps&quot; was on par with the quality of Shigeru Miyamoto games and an excellent display of Rare&#x27;s potential. &quot;Next Generation&quot; described it as &quot;effectively every Tonka fantasy brought vividly and explosively to life&quot;.

&quot;EGM&quot; named it a runner-up for &quot;Most Original Game of the Year&quot; (behind &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;) at their 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards.

&quot;Blast Corps&quot; sold close to a million copies. The game sold reasonably well in Japan. Metacritic ranked the title among the top ten games released in 1997. It remained Metacritic&#x27;s highest ranked 1997 Nintendo 64 game after &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. &quot;Blast Corps&quot; was selected as &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; May 1997 Game of the Month and an &quot;IGN&quot; Editors&#x27; Choice. Later the same year, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it number 93 on their 100 best console video games of all time, remarking, &quot;C&#x27;mon, not only are you driving all the vehicles you thought were mega cool as a kid – you&#x27;re using &#x27;em to plow through buildings.&quot; Four of six &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; reviewers recommended the game.

== Legacy ==
Wakeley, the game&#x27;s designer, considered making a sequel as an action combat game, but thought the concepts behind &quot;Blast Corps&quot; had been fully exhausted. After praising the game in a 2010 Rare retrospective feature, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; writers craved a sequel. The magazine said the title was proof of the company&#x27;s inventiveness. Steve Ellis, who was a programmer at Rare, thought &quot;Blast Corps&quot; to be among the company&#x27;s most underrated games, and though its physics were now dated, he continued to find the game fun enough to revisit regularly. &quot;Blast Corps&quot; is included in &quot;Rare Replay&quot;, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015. The release&#x27;s bonus features included behind-the-scenes interviews with &quot;Blast Corps&quot; developers. &quot;Blast Corps&quot; was a standout favorite among &quot;Rare Replay&quot; reviewers. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in North America and Europe on February 21, 2024, and in Japan on April 24, 2024.

Rare&#x27;s &quot;Blast Corps&quot; began a run of highly praised Nintendo 64 games, including &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, and &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote that Rare had doubled the number of classic Nintendo 64 games and was an important alliance for Nintendo. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002 for a record price of $377 million. After the industry had changed, &quot;Blast Corps&quot; designer Martin Wakeley reflected a decade after the game&#x27;s 1997 release. In 2009, Wakeley said, a studio would rarely entrust the scope of a project like &quot;Blast Corps&quot; to a team of four recent graduates.

The staff of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; (1997) and &quot;IGN&quot; (2014) both listed &quot;Blast Corps&quot; in the bottom halves of their top 100 Nintendo games of all time. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 84th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games.

<doc id="405683" wikidata="Q1155976" url="?curid=405683" title="Xi Shi">
<text>Xi Shi (Hsi Shih; , ), also known by the nickname Xizi, was one of the renowned Four Beauties of ancient China. She was said to have lived in a small Yue village (today part of Zhuji, a county-level city in Shaoxing, Zhejiang) during the end of the Spring and Autumn period. According to legend, Xi Shi was originally a girl who regularly washed gauze in the Huan Sha river.

In traditional stories, Xi Shi was named Shi Yiguang (施夷光). She was discovered by the Yue minister Fan Li and given to King Fuchai of Wu by King Goujian of Yue in a sexpionage operation which successfully brought down the State of Wu in 473 BC. This account first appeared in &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue&quot; published five centuries after the conquest, and is completely absent in earlier works such as &quot;Guoyu&quot;, &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot;, and &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;.

Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, Diao Chan and Yang Guifei are known as the “Four Beauties in Ancient China”, among which Xi Shi is chronologically the first.

==Appearance==

Xi Shi&#x27;s beauty is reputed to have been so extraordinary that, as she leaned over a balcony to observe fish in a pond, the fish were allegedly mesmerized to the extent that they momentarily ceased swimming and descended beneath the water&#x27;s surface. This narrative serves as the origin of the first two characters of the Chinese idiom 沉魚落雁, 閉月羞花 (). This idiom is commonly used to compliment a woman&#x27;s beauty, symbolizing that her allure is so captivating that it can cause fish to submerge, birds to descend, the moon to hide, and flowers to blush. (Literal translation: &#x27;fish dive, goose fall; moon hide, flower shame&#x27;)

==Story of Xi Shi==

King Goujian of Yue was once imprisoned by King Fuchai of Wu following a military defeat. As a result, the state of Yue became a tributary state to the State of Wu. In a clandestine effort to plot his revenge, King Goujian&#x27;s minister Wen Zhong suggested training exceptionally beautiful women and offering them to King Fuchai as a tribute, well aware of Fuchai&#x27;s weakness for beautiful women. Another minister, Fan Li, identified and procured two such women, namely Xi Shi and Zheng Dan (郑旦), After nearly three years of training and training, Xi transformed the rural girl into a learned lady, good at drawing, calligraphy and chess, and presented them to Fuchai in 490 BC.

Enchanted by the beauty of Xi Shi and Zheng Dan, King Fuchai became wholly preoccupied with their presence, diverting his attention from matters of state. Gradually, he began to overlook his political responsibilities and preferred to spend leisure time with Xi Shi. He often took her by carriage to the hustle and bustle of the city, where he would boast to those around him about winning the heart of the most beautiful woman in the world. Influenced by Xi Shi&#x27;s counsel, he made the grievous decision to eliminate his trusted advisor, the esteemed general Wu Zixu. Furthermore, Fuchai constructed the Guanwa Palace (Palace of Beautiful Women) within an imperial park situated on the slopes of Lingyan Hill, approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) west of Suzhou. In the wake of these events, the power and influence of the Wu kingdom began to wane. In the year 473 BC, King Goujian seized the opportunity to launch a decisive offensive against Wu, resulting in the complete and utter defeat of the Wu army. King Fuchai, overwhelmed with remorse for disregarding the counsel of Wu Zixu, took his own life.

In the legend, after the fall of Wu, Fan Li (范蠡) retired from his ministerial post and lived with Xi Shi on a fishing boat, roaming like fairies in the misty wilderness of Taihu Lake, and no one saw them ever again. This is according to Yuan Kang&#x27;s &quot;Yue Jueshu&quot; (越绝书), which records: &quot;After the West Shi died of Wu, he returned to Fan Li, and went with Pan Wuhu.&quot; Another version, according to Mozi, is that Xi Shi later died from drowning in the river. No matter how she died, she has been remembered for her sacrifices and for embodying ideals of loyalty, courage and selflessness for more than two millennia. 

==Influence==

The West Lake in Hangzhou is said to be the incarnation of Xi Shi, hence it is also called Xizi Lake, Xizi being another name for Xi Shi, meaning Lady Xi. In his famous poem &quot;Drinks at West Lake through Sunshine and Rain&quot; (飲湖上初睛居雨), renowned Song Dynasty poet Su Shi compared the beauty of the West Lake to that of Xi Shi.

Several Tang Dynasty poets wrote about Xi Shi and her story in their poetry, including Li Bai and Wang Wei.

Xi Shi is mentioned in the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, as a sign of grace and beauty.

Xi Shi is referenced in one of the Four Masterpieces of Chinese literature, &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber,&quot; where the heroine Lin Daiyu is described as having a delicate and frail appearance akin to that of Xi Shi. Both Lin and Xi Shi evoke the image of a beautiful lady with a delicate and fragile presence.

Xi Shi appears in the martial arts fiction by Jin Yong (Louis Cha), &quot;Sword of the Yue Maiden&quot;.

Her name also inspired the modern name of the Shih Tzu, whose Chinese name translates to &quot;Xi Shi dog&quot;, but whose English name has been claimed to come from the word for &quot;lion&quot;. The moniker &quot;lion dog&quot; in Chinese is actually reserved for the Pekingese.

Xi Shi is referenced in the idiom , meaning &quot;&quot; (literally: &quot;in the eyes of a lover, Xi Shi appears&quot;). 

Since its introduction into literary works, the image of Xi Shi has continuously appeared and presented different colors in the writings of literati. From the initial &quot;beauty of the world&quot; to the &quot;beauty disaster&quot; in the Song Dynasty, and then to the &quot;heroine&quot; in the mid Ming Dynasty, the portrayal of her image carries the imprint of changes in the times and the interpretation of literati individuals.

== Xi Shi&#x27;s hometown ==
Xishi Old Town, located on the south side of Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, is an important part of the national key scenic spots of the Ruanjiang River. It is a national AAAA tourist area.

The scenic spots include the Wansa River Scenic Belt, the ancient Yue Cultural District, the Hall of Fame, the leisure resort, Fan Li Temple, Xishijeon Hall, Zheng Danjeong Pavilion, Guoyue Terrace, Feijianjeong Pavilion and Panshan Monument Gallery.

The scenic spot was named Xishi Legend&#x27;s municipal heritage base in June 2006, and was named Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage Tourism Scenic Area in 2010.

Although there has been controversy over the hometown of Xi Shi, on June 10, 2006, the first China Intangible Cultural Heritage Day, the State Council announced the first batch of China&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage list, and the &quot;Legend of Xi Shi&quot; was listed.This means that the controversy over whether Xishi&#x27;s hometown is Zhuji or Xiaoshan has settled over the years.

<text>Lars Olof Jonathan Söderblom (; 15 January 1866 – 12 July 1931) was a Swedish bishop. He was the Church of Sweden Archbishop of Uppsala from 1914 to 1931, and recipient of the 1930 Nobel Peace Prize. He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 12 July.

==Life and career==
Söderblom was born in the village of Trönö in Söderhamn Municipality, Gävleborg County. His father was a parish priest. He enrolled at Uppsala University in 1883. Although not initially convinced what he wanted to study, he eventually decided to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps. On returning from a journey to the United States, he was ordained as a priest in 1893. During the years 1892 and 1893, he was first vice president and then president of the Uppsala Student Union.

From 1894 to 1901, he had a ministry position at the Swedish Embassy in Paris, where his congregation included both Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) and August Strindberg (1849–1912). In 1897, he officiated at the memorial service for Nobel. From 1901 to 1914, Söderblom held a chair in the School of Theology at Uppsala University and from 1912 to 1914 was also a professor of religious studies at Leipzig University. In 1914, he was elected as Archbishop of Uppsala, the head of the Lutheran church in Sweden. During the First World War, he called on all Christian leaders to work for peace and justice while working to alleviate the conditions of prisoners of war and refugees.

He believed that church unity had the specific purpose of presenting the gospel to the world and that the messages of Jesus were relevant to social life. His leadership of the Christian &quot;Life and Work&quot; movement in the 1920s has led him to be recognised as one of the principal founders of the ecumenical movement. He had begun the movement toward intercommunion between the Church of Sweden and the Church of England and was a close associate of the English ecumenist George Bell (1883–1958), Dean of Canterbury, Bishop of Chichester. He was instrumental in chairing the World Conference of Life and Work in Stockholm, in 1925. In 1930 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

<doc id="405702" wikidata="Q1538347" url="?curid=405702" title="Gorky's Zygotic Mynci">
<text>Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci () were a psychedelic folk and alternative rock band which formed in Carmarthen, Wales, in 1991. The group performed music in both Welsh and English, and they had eight Top 75 singles on the UK Singles Chart during their career. They were prominent during the era known as Cool Cymru. The group disbanded in May 2006.

==Biography==
The group was formed by Euros Childs (vocals and keyboards), John Lawrence (vocals and guitar) and Richard James (bass guitar) whilst still at Bro Myrddin Welsh Comprehensive School in Carmarthen. Beyond their main roles in the band, all three were multi-instrumentalists and often swapped around instruments both in the studio and onstage. With Sion Lane (keyboards) and Steffan Cravos (violin) added to the lineup, Gorky&#x27;s recorded the self-released cassette &quot;Allumette&quot; (1991). Sion and Steffan left shortly afterwards (the latter going on to form Welsh language rap group Tystion) and drummer Osian Evans was recruited for second cassette &quot;Peiriant Pleser&quot; (1992). 

Euros Childs&#x27; sister Megan Childs (violin) subsequently joined the group and the band signed to the Welsh record label Ankst. The band&#x27;s first release for the label was &quot;Patio&quot; (1992), a 10&quot; collection of various live, home and studio recordings (this was later expanded for the 1995 CD version) which John Cale once proclaimed to be his &#x27;favourite album ever&#x27;. Gorky&#x27;s also released a number of singles and EPs on Ankst, demonstrating a taste for psychedelia and playfulness evidently inspired by the Canterbury scene of the 1960s and 1970s (Kevin Ayers&#x27; album &quot;Shooting at the Moon&quot; is cited in the notes to &quot;Tatay&quot; as &quot;the best LP of all time&quot;, and the record also includes a version of Robert Wyatt&#x27;s &quot;O, Caroline&quot;). The band began to be championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel (other than that, it was extremely rare to hear Welsh-language music on such a station). 

In 1994 Gorky&#x27;s released their first full studio album, &quot;Tatay&quot;. By 1995, Euros Rowlands had replaced Osian Evans on drums in time to record a second album – &quot;Bwyd Time&quot; – which featured a wide range of instrumentation (such as the parts for the celesta and sitar credited on &quot;Iechyd Da&quot;). Both albums were produced by Alan Holmes who also provided their colourful artwork. These early releases show a huge range of influences and styles: &quot;Thema o Cartref&quot;, the opening track of &quot;Tatay&quot;, for example, is a relatively gentle harmonium-backed song, while &quot;When You Hear the Captain Sing&quot; appears to be a tribute of sorts to Captain Beefheart and &quot;Amsermaemaiyndod/cinema&quot; presents one song in the right channel and a completely different one in the left. The 1996 compilation &quot;Introducing Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci&quot; (the band&#x27;s first release in America) compiled material from the Ankst album and singles and summed up this phase of Gorky&#x27;s career. 

Now attracting the interest of larger record labels, Gorky&#x27;s left Ankst and signed to Fontana Records. Their next album, &quot;Barafundle&quot; (1997), was produced by Gorwel Owen who had also worked with the Super Furry Animals. The wide-ranging instrumentation remained (&quot;Diamond Dew&quot; has a prominent part for the jaw harp) and there were still psychedelic touches, but the album as a whole was more laid back than their earlier work, tending more towards folk music. This gentler direction was largely maintained and refined in their later records, though the occasional poppier and rockier number, such as &quot;Poodle Rockin&#x27;&quot; from &quot;Spanish Dance Troupe&quot; or &quot;Mow the Lawn&quot; from &quot;Sleep/Holiday&quot;, continued to crop up.

Following their fifth album – 1998&#x27;s appropriately-titled &quot;Gorky 5&quot;, which was released on Fontana&#x27;s sister label Mercury Records – the band were dropped by Fontana. They quickly signed to Mantra Recordings (a division of the Beggars&#x27; Banquet label). In 1999, Gorky&#x27;s released their first album for Mantra, &quot;Spanish Dance Troupe&quot;. This would be the last Gorky&#x27;s album to feature input from founder member John Lawrence, who left the group during the recording sessions. Richard James took on Lawrence&#x27;s former role of main guitarist, and Gorky&#x27;s also recruited former Ffa Coffi Pawb member Rhodri Puw as a sideman to play guitar and bass guitar on tour. In 2000, Gorky&#x27;s appeared with John Cale in a movie called &quot;Beautiful Mistake&quot;, in which they performed 1994 album track &quot;O Caroline II&quot;. In the same year, the band released an acoustic mini-album called &quot;The Blue Trees&quot; in 2000, after which drummer Euros Rowlands left Gorky&#x27;s to take up a career in teaching.

Rowlands was replaced by former Topper drummer Peter Richardson, and at around the same time Rhodri Puw was confirmed as being a full member of the band. This lineup of Gorky&#x27;s recorded and toured two more albums – &quot;How I Long to Feel That Summer in My Heart&quot; (2001) and &quot;Sleep/Holiday&quot; (2003, on the Sanctuary Music label). The latter would prove to be the final Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci album. Although Euros Childs and Richard James would spend time working on separate projects for a while, the band did not announce their formal split until May 2006.

In 2010 Richard James and Euros Childs performed at Dan Rebellato&#x27;s wedding, with him later telling Lauren Laverne via Twitter, &quot;We somehow got Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci to reform and play our wedding last year, so it was wall-to-wall musical awesomeness&quot;. They&#x27;ve also collaborated on other short-term occasions, such as the online music video series &quot;Outside My House&quot; (2014). James and the Childs siblings also performed at the Charlotte Greig memorial concert in Cardiff in 2014.

Wales Online&#x27;s David Owens called the band &quot;one of the most original and unique bands in the history of Welsh music.”

==Origin of the band name==
While in the band, Childs said that one of the most frequent questions he was asked was about the origin of the band&#x27;s name. After struggling to come up with one, they decided &quot;we might as well stick with the most ridiculous crap name we could think of.&quot;

Gorky&#x27;s came from the word &quot;gawky&quot;; Lawrence says that &quot;gork&quot; was school slang for a dimwit.

Zygotic was &quot;hijacked from GCSE biology&quot;; it refers to the state of being like a &quot;zygote&quot; – a fertilized egg cell.

Mynci is a spelling of the word &quot;monkey&quot; using Welsh spelling rules, rather than a direct Welsh translation (the actual Welsh word is &quot;mwnci&quot;) and is pronounced like &quot;monkey&quot;.

<text>Christopher Anthony John Martin (born 2 March 1977) is an English singer, songwriter, musician and producer. He is best known as the vocalist, pianist and co-founder of the rock band Coldplay.

Born in Exeter, Martin went to University College London, where he formed Coldplay with Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion. The band signed with Parlophone in 1999, finding global fame with &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000) and following albums. He has won seven Grammy Awards and nine Brit Awards as part of Coldplay. Having sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, they are the most successful group of the 21st century. &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; have cited Martin among the most influential figures in the United Kingdom, while &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked him as one of the best male singers of the 21st century.

== Early life ==
Christopher Anthony John Martin was born on 2 March 1977 in Exeter, Devon, England. He is the eldest of five children. His father, Anthony John Martin, is a retired chartered accountant. His mother, Alison Martin, is from Zimbabwe and works as a music teacher. His family&#x27;s caravan and motorhome sales business, Martin&#x27;s of Exeter, was founded in 1929 by his grandfather John Besley Martin, CBE (a High Sheriff-also Mayor in 1968 of Exeter). His great-great-grandfather, William Willett, campaigned for and made daylight saving time a recognised practice.

Martin lived with his family in Zimbabwe when he was 10 years old, later attending the Hylton and Exeter Cathedral schools, where he found his passion for music. His secondary education was carried out at Sherborne School, where he met Coldplay manager Phil Harvey. Before college in England, he worked at Shed Studios, producing jingles for plays at St. George&#x27;s College, Harare. He then enrolled at University College London, where he was awarded a first-class honours degree in Greek and Latin. It was at UCL that Martin met Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion.

== Career ==
=== Coldplay ===
Martin was responsible for co-founding the band along with Buckland; they met each other during UCL&#x27;s orientation week in 1996. The pair spent the rest of the year planning a band and started to write their first songs together in early 1997, practising every night as well. Berryman joined the group in the following months and they recorded numerous demos without a drummer. By November, the trio was known as Big Fat Noises. In 1998, they became Starfish &quot;in a panic&quot;, as Champion scheduled their debut live performance at The Laurel Tree only a few days after he joined the line-up. Weeks later, the band settled on the name Coldplay, which came from UCL friend Tim Crompton. He originally considered it for his own band after finding a copy of Philip Horky&#x27;s &quot;Child&#x27;s Reflections, Cold Play&quot; (1997), but the idea was ultimately discarded.

Since the release of their debut album, &quot;Parachutes&quot;, in 2000, the band have achieved internationally recognised fame and success. Their song &quot;Yellow&quot;, from &quot;Parachutes&quot;, entered the charts at number four and began the group&#x27;s enduring popularity. To date, they have released ten studio albums in total including &quot;Parachutes,&quot; &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;, &quot;Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends&quot;, &quot;Mylo Xyloto&quot;, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, &quot;A Head Full of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Everyday Life&quot;, &quot;Music of the Spheres, and Moon Music&quot;.

=== Solo work ===
Martin has written songs for a variety of acts including Embrace (&quot;Gravity&quot;) and Jamelia (&quot;See It in a Boy&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, co-written with Coldplay producer Rik Simpson). Martin has also collaborated with Ron Sexsmith, Faultline, the Streets, and Ian McCulloch. He also sang a part of the vocals for the Band Aid 20 single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; at the end of 2004. In 2005, Martin collaborated with Nelly Furtado on the track &quot;All Good Things (Come to an End)&quot;, for her 2006 album, &quot;Loose&quot;. The two were once rumoured to be a couple, after they both performed at Glastonbury in 2002. Furtado joked about it, saying, &quot;Yeah, he&#x27;s my boyfriend — he just doesn&#x27;t know it yet&quot;.
Martin&#x27;s fascination with hip hop was shown in mid-2006 when he collaborated with rapper Jay-Z for the rapper&#x27;s comeback album, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, after the two met earlier in the year. Martin put some chords together for a song known as &quot;Beach Chair&quot; and sent them to Jay-Z who enlisted the help of hip-hop producer Dr. Dre to mix it. Coldplay producer Rik Simpson conceived and performed the drum beats. The song was performed on 27 September 2006 by the two during Jay-Z&#x27;s European tour at Royal Albert Hall. Martin has also worked on a solo collaboration with Kanye West, with whom he shared an impromptu jam session during a 2006 concert at Abbey Road Studios. He performed the chorus of &quot;Homecoming&quot;, from Kanye West&#x27;s album &quot;Graduation&quot;.

In 2015, Martin collaborated with DJ Avicii to work on two new tracks for his album &quot;Stories&quot;. Their first collaboration was officially named &quot;Heaven&quot;. Martin wrote the lyrics, Avicii did the production, and Simon Aldred of Cherry Ghost was the vocalist. He also provided the vocals for Avicii&#x27;s True Believer, also in &quot;Stories&quot;. In February 2017, Martin performed &quot;A Different Corner&quot; at the 2017 Brit Awards in tribute to George Michael.

A song he co-wrote called &quot;Homesick&quot; appears on Dua Lipa&#x27;s self-titled debut album, which was released in June 2017. In 2019, Martin was featured on Avicii&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Tim.&quot; The song &quot;Heaven&quot; features vocals by Martin and was written by Avicii and Martin prior to Avicii&#x27;s death.

=== Philanthropy ===
On 12 December 2012, Martin performed three songs, including &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; with Michael Stipe, as a part of the &quot;12/12/12 Concert&quot; which was held as a fundraiser for Hurricane Sandy relief. On 15 November 2014, Martin joined charity group Band Aid 30, performing alongside British and Irish pop acts on the latest version of the track &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa — this was the second time Martin has contributed to a Band Aid recording having performed in the 2004 version. Martin became the creative director of the newly established Global Citizen Festival in 2015, a role he plans to fulfil for 15 years.

=== Other projects ===
Martin and Coldplay guitarist Jonny Buckland made cameo appearances in the film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; as supporters of the fictional charity ZombAid. In 2006, Martin had a cameo role in the second series, episode four, of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant comedy &quot;Extras&quot;. He also appears singing in the closing credits of the 2009 Sacha Baron Cohen film &quot;Brüno&quot;, with Bono, Sting, Slash, Snoop Dogg, and Elton John.

In March 2015, Martin attended the televised launch of music streaming service Tidal via a video link, and revealed himself, along with other notable artists, as a shareholder in the company. In June 2015, Martin performed &quot;Til Kingdom Come&quot; at the funeral Mass of Beau Biden, the son of then United States Vice President Joe Biden, after learning that Beau Biden was a fan of his. In August 2017, Martin performed a live solo piano rendition of &quot;Crawling&quot; by Linkin Park. The performance was a tribute to Linkin Park&#x27;s lead singer Chester Bennington, who died by suicide the previous month.

== Influences ==

A major influence on Martin and Coldplay was the Scottish rock band Travis, with Martin crediting the band for the creation of his own band. The Irish rock band U2 is another important influence on Martin both musically and politically. Martin wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; on the band, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t buy weekend tickets to Ireland and hang out in front of their gates, but U2 are the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart. The first song on &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;, I know backward and forward—it&#x27;s so rousing, brilliant, and beautiful. It&#x27;s one of the first songs I played to my unborn baby.&quot; Martin has been also influenced by Radiohead. In 2024, Coldplay invited and performed alongside Michael J. Fox at the Glastonbury Festival.

Martin is very vocal about his love for Norwegian synth-pop band a-ha. In 2005, he stated in an interview: &quot;I found myself in Amsterdam the other day and I put a-ha&#x27;s first record on. I just remembered how much I loved it. It&#x27;s incredible songwriting. Everyone asks what inspired us, what we&#x27;ve been trying to steal from and what we listened to as we were growing up — the first band I ever loved was a-ha.&quot; Martin has also performed live together with Magne Furuholmen of a-ha, introducing him as &quot;the best keyboard player in the world&quot;. In November 2011, he stated that &quot;back when we didn&#x27;t have any hits of our own we used to play a-ha songs.&quot;

Martin is also a fan of English rock bands Oasis and Muse, Irish pop group Westlife, English-Irish girl group Girls Aloud, English pop group Take That, and Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire. In 2014, Martin inducted Peter Gabriel into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his solo career, and performed live with him.

Coldplay performed R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Nightswimming&quot; with Michael Stipe during their Austin City Limits performance in 2005, as a part of the Twisted Logic Tour. Martin went on to call &quot;Nightswimming&quot; &quot;the greatest song ever written&quot;. He has called Richard Ashcroft, formerly of the Verve, &quot;the best singer in the world&quot;. He also admires the lyrics of Morrissey. Martin was quoted as calling Coldplay&#x27;s song &quot;Shiver&quot; a rip-off Jeff Buckley influenced by Buckley&#x27;s song &quot;Grace&quot;. In 2008, Coldplay released an alternate music video for &quot;Viva la Vida&quot;, directed by Anton Corbijn as a tribute to Corbijn&#x27;s 1990 video for Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;. It shows Martin dressed as a king, as Dave Gahan was in the original video. The band stated: &quot;This is our attempt at a video cover version, made out of love for Depeche Mode and the genius of Anton Corbijn&quot;.

== Personal life ==
According to &quot;The Times&quot; in May 2023, Martin had an estimated net worth of £160 million. In a 2012 interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Martin revealed that he had been suffering from tinnitus since his early adult years, although he said that he had noticed the symptoms even as a teenager &quot;while listening to loud music&quot;. As a result, Martin wears specially filtered earplugs or customised in-ear monitors while performing and has encouraged his bandmates to do the same as a preventive measure. Similarly, he has encouraged his children to wear hearing protection at concerts. Martin has also become an advocate for hearing loss awareness, having partnered with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. PETA named Martin the World&#x27;s Sexiest Vegetarian in 2005. However, he began eating meat again after his separation from his then-wife, American actress Gwyneth Paltrow.

Martin is a supporter of Exeter City. He is also ambidextrous. In February 2020, a cassette tape was discovered by a former fellow pupil of Martin&#x27;s. It contained a three-minute instrumental piece titled &quot;Electric Thunder&quot;, which was composed by Martin, aged 12, at Exeter Cathedral School. Martin played keyboards on the track accompanying other pupils performing in a group called Grandisson Ensemble. The cassette was expected to sell for £600 at auction; it ultimately fetched £840 (US$).

=== Relationships ===
According to one source, Martin previously had a relationship with live events producer Lily Sobhani around the &quot;Parachutes&quot; album release. He and Paltrow married on 5 December 2003. Their daughter Apple was born in May 2004 in London. Martin and the band released a song called &quot;I am your baby&#x27;s daddy&quot; under the name &quot;the Nappies&quot; in anticipation of her birth. Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; was also inspired by Martin&#x27;s experience and awe at becoming a father, being the lead single for the band&#x27;s &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; album. Actor Simon Pegg and Martin&#x27;s bandmate Jonny Buckland are his daughter&#x27;s godfathers, and Martin is godfather to Pegg&#x27;s daughter. His second child, Moses, was born in April 2006 in New York City. The name was inspired by a song of the same name. In March 2014, Martin and Paltrow announced their separation as a &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; after ten years of marriage. Paltrow filed for divorce in April 2015 and it was finalised on 14 July 2016. From August 2015 to August 2017, he was in an on-and-off relationship with actress Annabelle Wallis. Since 2017, Martin has been in a relationship with American actress Dakota Johnson. They reside in Malibu, California. In 2024, it was revealed the couple have been engaged for several years. 
=== Politics ===

Martin has been particularly outspoken on issues of fair trade and has campaigned for Oxfam&#x27;s Make Trade Fair campaign. He travelled to Ghana and Haiti to meet farmers and view the effects of unfair trade practices. When performing he usually has variations of &quot;Make Trade Fair&quot;, &quot;MTF&quot; or an equal sign written on the back of his left hand and the letters &quot;MTF&quot; can be seen emblazoned on his piano.

He was a vocal critic of US President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. During the Teenage Cancer Trust show at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 24 March 2003, he encouraged the sell-out crowd to &quot;sing against war&quot;. He was a strong supporter of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, most notably during his acceptance speech for the 2004 Grammy Awards Record of the Year, accepting for &quot;Clocks&quot;. He supported Barack Obama for president in 2008, giving a shout-out at the end of a performance of &quot;Yellow&quot; on 25 October 2008 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

On 1 April 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Martin was backing the British Conservative Party leader David Cameron, and had written a new theme song for the party titled &quot;Talk to David&quot;. This was later revealed to be an April Fool&#x27;s joke. While touring Australia in March 2009, Martin and the rest of Coldplay were the opening act at the Sound Relief benefit concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney, for the victims of bushfires and floods in Victoria and Queensland. Martin appeared in a video for the &quot;Robin Hood Tax&quot; campaign, which proposes a tax on stock trades in the United States. This tax is aimed at levelling the field between the 1% and 99%. In June 2016, Martin supported Vote Remain in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

<text>Jeffrey is a common English given name, and a variant form of the name Geoffrey (itself from a Middle French variant of Godfrey, Gottfried).

It has been argued that the common derivation of Middle French &quot;Geoffrey (or Geoffroy), Jeffery&quot; from &quot;Godfrey&quot; is mistaken, and that the names reflect two separate first Germanic elements &quot;god&quot; vs. &quot;gaut&quot;, which became conflated in Old High German by the end of the early medieval period.

Outside of North America, &quot;Geoffrey&quot; is more common than &quot;Jeffrey&quot;. Jeffrey and its variants are found as surnames, usually as a patronymic ending in -s (e.g., Jefferies, Jaffrays); The surname Jefferson is also a patronymic version of the given name. In Scotland, Jeffrey is most frequently found to be a surname.

Variations include Jeff, Jeffry, Jeffy, Jeffery, Jefferey, Jeffory, Jefrie, Geoff, Geoffrey, Jeffeory, Geffrey, Jefferson, and Jeffro.

<doc id="405711" wikidata="Q2486351" url="?curid=405711" title="Superluminal motion">
<text>In astronomy, superluminal motion is the apparently faster-than-light motion seen in some radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, blazars and recently also in some galactic sources called microquasars. Bursts of energy moving out along the relativistic jets emitted from these objects can have a proper motion that appears greater than the speed of light. All of these sources are thought to contain a black hole, responsible for the ejection of mass at high velocities. Light echoes can also produce apparent superluminal motion.

==Explanation==
Superluminal motion occurs as a special case of a more general phenomenon arising from the difference between the apparent speed of distant objects moving across the sky and their actual speed as measured at the source.

In tracking the movement of such objects across the sky, a naive calculation of their speed can be derived by a simple distance divided by time calculation. If the distance of the object from the Earth is known, the angular speed of the object can be measured, and the speed can be naively calculated via:

This calculation does not yield the actual speed of the object, as it fails to account for the fact that the speed of light is finite. When measuring the movement of distant objects across the sky, there is a large time delay between what has been observed and what has occurred, due to the large distance the light from the distant object has to travel to reach us. The error in the above naive calculation comes from the fact that when an object has a component of velocity directed towards the Earth, as the object moves closer to the Earth that time delay becomes smaller. This means that the apparent speed as calculated above is greater than the actual speed. Correspondingly, if the object is moving away from the Earth, the above calculation underestimates the actual speed.

This effect in itself does not generally lead to superluminal motion being observed. But when the actual speed of the object is close to the speed of light, the apparent speed can be observed as greater than the speed of light, as a result of the above effect. As the actual speed of the object approaches the speed of light, the effect is most pronounced as the component of the velocity towards the Earth increases. This means that in most cases, &#x27;superluminal&#x27; objects are travelling almost directly towards the Earth. However it is not strictly necessary for this to be the case, and superluminal motion can still be observed in objects with appreciable velocities not directed towards the Earth.

Superluminal motion is most often observed in two opposing jets emanating from the core of a star or black hole. In this case, one jet is moving away from and one towards the Earth. If Doppler shifts are observed in both sources, the velocity and the distance can be determined independently of other observations.

===Some contrary evidence===
As early as 1983, at the &quot;superluminal workshop&quot; held at Jodrell Bank Observatory, referring to the seven then-known superluminal jets,

Schilizzi ... presented maps of arc-second resolution [showing the large-scale outer jets] ... which ... have revealed outer double structure in all but one (3C 273) of the known superluminal sources. An embarrassment is that the average projected size [on the sky] of the outer structure is no smaller than that of the normal radio-source population.

In other words, the jets are evidently not, on average, close to the Earth&#x27;s line-of-sight. (Their apparent length would appear much shorter if they were.)

In 1993, Thomson et al. suggested that the (outer) jet of the quasar 3C 273 is nearly collinear to the Earth&#x27;s line-of-sight. Superluminal motion of up to ~9.6&quot;c&quot; has been observed along the (inner) jet of this quasar.

Superluminal motion of up to 6&quot;c&quot; has been observed in the inner parts of the jet of M87. To explain this in terms of the &quot;narrow-angle&quot; model, the jet must be no more than 19° from the Earth&#x27;s line-of-sight. But evidence suggests that the jet is in fact at about 43° to the Earth&#x27;s line-of-sight. The same group of scientists later revised that finding and argue in favour of a superluminal bulk movement in which the jet is embedded.

Suggestions of turbulence and/or &quot;wide cones&quot; in the inner parts of the jets have been put forward to try to counter such problems, and there seems to be some evidence for this.

====Signal velocity====
The model identifies a difference between the information carried by the wave at its signal velocity &quot;c&quot;, and the information about the wave front&#x27;s apparent rate of change of position. If a light pulse is envisaged in a wave guide (glass tube) moving across an observer&#x27;s field of view, the pulse can only move at &quot;c&quot; through the guide. If that pulse is also directed towards the observer, he will receive that wave information, at &quot;c&quot;. If the wave guide is moved in the same direction as the pulse, the information on its position, passed to the observer as lateral emissions from the pulse, changes. He may see the rate of change of position as apparently representing motion faster than &quot;c&quot; when calculated, like the edge of a shadow across a curved surface. This is a different signal, containing different information, to the pulse and does not break the second postulate of special relativity. &quot;c&quot; is strictly maintained in all local fields.

==Derivation of the apparent velocity==
A relativistic jet coming out of the center of an active galactic nucleus is moving along AB with a velocity &quot;v&quot;, and is observed from the point O. At time formula_1 a light ray leaves the jet from point A and another ray leaves at time formula_2 from point B. An observer at O receives the rays at time formula_3 and formula_4 respectively. The angle formula_5 is small enough that the two distances marked formula_6 can be considered equal.

: formula_7
: formula_8
: formula_9
: formula_10

: formula_11
: formula_12

: formula_13, where formula_14

: formula_15

: formula_16

Apparent transverse velocity along formula_17, formula_18

: formula_19

The apparent transverse velocity is maximal for angle (formula_20 is used)

: formula_21

: formula_22

: formula_23

: formula_24, where formula_25

: formula_26

If formula_27 (i.e. when velocity of jet is close to the velocity of light) then formula_28 despite the fact that formula_29. And of course formula_30 means that the apparent transverse velocity along formula_17, the only velocity on the sky that can be measured, is larger than the velocity of light in vacuum, i.e. the motion is apparently superluminal.

==History==

The apparent superluminal motion in the faint nebula surrounding Nova Persei was first observed in 1901 by Charles Dillon Perrine. “Mr. Perrine’s photograph of November 7th and 8th, 1901, secured with the Crossley Reflector, led to the remarkable discovery that the masses of nebulosity were apparently in motion, with a speed perhaps several hundred times as great as hitherto observed.” “Using the 36-in. telescope (Crossley), he discovered the apparent superluminal motion of the expanding light bubble around Nova Persei (1901). Thought to be a nebula, the visual appearance was actually caused by light from the nova event reflected from the surrounding interstellar medium as the light moved outward from the star. Perrine studied this phenomenon using photographic, spectroscopic, and polarization techniques.” 

Superluminal motion was first observed in 1902 by Jacobus Kapteyn in the ejecta of the nova GK Persei, which had exploded in 1901. His discovery was published in the German journal &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;, and received little attention from English-speaking astronomers until many decades later.

In 1966, Martin Rees pointed out that &quot;an object moving relativistically in suitable directions may appear to a distant observer to have a transverse velocity much greater than the velocity of light&quot;. In 1969 and 1970 such sources were found as very distant astronomical radio sources, such as radio galaxies and quasars, and were called superluminal sources. The discovery was the result of a new technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, which allowed astronomers to set limits to the angular size of components and to determine positions to better than milli-arcseconds, and in particular to determine the change in positions on the sky, called proper motions, in a timespan of typically years. The apparent velocity is obtained by multiplying the observed proper motion by the distance, which could be up to 6 times the speed of light.

In the introduction to a workshop on superluminal radio sources, Pearson and Zensus reported

The first indications of changes in the structure of some sources were obtained by an American-Australian team in a series of transpacific VLBI observations between 1968 and 1970 (Gubbay et al. 1969). Following the early experiments, they had realised the potential of the NASA tracking antennas for VLBI measurements and set up an interferometer operating between California and Australia. The change in the source visibility that they measured for 3C 279, combined with changes in total flux density, indicated that a component first seen in 1969 had reached a diameter of about 1 milliarcsecond, implying expansion at an apparent velocity of at least twice the speed of light. Aware of Rees&#x27;s model, (Moffet et al. 1972) concluded that their measurement presented evidence for relativistic expansion of this component. This interpretation, although by no means unique, was later confirmed, and in hindsight it seems fair to say that their experiment was the first interferometric measurement of superluminal expansion.

In 1994, a galactic speed record was obtained with the discovery of a superluminal source in the Milky Way, the cosmic x-ray source GRS 1915+105. The expansion occurred on a much shorter timescale. Several separate blobs were seen to expand in pairs within weeks by typically 0.5 arcsec. Because of the analogy with quasars, this source was called a microquasar.

<text>Robert Lorne Stanfield (April 11, 1914 – December 16, 2003) was a Canadian politician who served as the 17th premier of Nova Scotia from 1956 to 1967 and the leader of the Official Opposition and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from 1967 to 1976.

Born into an affluent Nova Scotia clothing manufacturing and political family in Truro, Stanfield graduated from Dalhousie University and Harvard Law School in the 1930s. He was a lawyer before becoming the leader of the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party in 1948, with the goal of reviving the party that did not have a single seat in the legislature. After a rebuilding period, Stanfield led the party to a majority government in 1956; their first victory since 1928. Leading the party to four majorities in total, Stanfield&#x27;s government established Industrial Estates Limited (IEL) to attract new industry in Nova Scotia, introduced hospital insurance and a provincial sales tax (PST) to fund half of it, prioritized human rights for Black Nova Scotians, and drastically increased funding for education.

In 1967, he resigned as premier and was elected the leader of the federal Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, thus becoming the leader of the Official Opposition. In the 1968 federal election, he suffered a landslide defeat to the incumbent Liberals led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. In 1972, Stanfield recovered the PCs&#x27; standing and narrowly lost to Trudeau for a second time. In 1974, he lost to Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals for a third time by a wide margin. Stanfield was a strong supporter of bilingualism, putting him at odds with some members of the PC Party. He resigned as leader in 1976 and from politics in 1979.

In retirement, he lived mostly in Ottawa, and campaigned for the Meech Lake Accord, the Charlottetown Accord, and free trade in the 1980s and early 1990s. He died in Ottawa in 2003 from complications due to pneumonia. He was one of only several people granted the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; who were not so entitled by virtue of an office held.

==Early life (1913–1947)==
Stanfield was born in Truro, Nova Scotia, the son of Sarah Emma (née Thomas) and entrepreneur Frank Stanfield, and was named after Robert Borden, a fellow Nova Scotian who was prime minister at the time. Stanfield&#x27;s family owned Stanfield&#x27;s Limited, a large textile company. Stanfield studied economics and political science at Dalhousie University and was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Silver Medal for achieving the highest standing when he graduated in 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.

Stanfield then studied at Harvard Law School, where he was an honours student near the top of his class and the first Canadian editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review.&quot; During his student days in the 1930s, he witnessed the poverty that the Great Depression produced, causing him to become interested in John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s economic theories. Stanfield then considered himself a socialist. Over time, he was less attached to socialism, but its influence on him remained, as he was considered a Red Tory for his appreciation of the common good. Stanfield graduated from Harvard in 1939 and was called to the bar in 1940. From 1939 to 1945 during World War II, he worked as a member of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board&#x27;s Halifax staff.

==Provincial politics (1947–1967)==
Stanfield decided to enter Nova Scotia politics. In 1947 he became president of the Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia (PCs) which was in poor shape as it did not have a single seat in the legislature, while the Liberals dominated the province. In 1948, Stanfield was elected leader of the party, and began the process of reviving the party. In the 1949 election, the PCs won 8 seats and in 1953, they won 12. In the 1956 election, the PCs won a majority government, their first victory since 1928. This ended 23 consecutive years of Liberal rule.

===Premier of Nova Scotia (1956–1967)===

Known as &quot;Honest Bob&quot; for his straightforward manner, Stanfield served as premier of Nova Scotia, governing as a moderate and pragmatist. He led reforms on education, human rights, and health care. He led the PCs to three re-elections in 1960, 1963, and 1967, each time with larger majorities.

====Economic policy====

In 1957, Stanfield&#x27;s government established the crown corporation Industrial Estates Limited (IEL) to attract new industry in Nova Scotia. By the time Stanfield left office in 1967, the IEL had invested $74 million into 25 new firms and created nearly 2,300 jobs in the province.

In 1963, Stanfield&#x27;s government established the Nova Scotia Voluntary Planning Board to assist the minister of finance in creating measures to increase the rate of economic growth through voluntary economic planning.

Stanfield&#x27;s government raised the limit on agricultural loans from $8,000 to $100,000. To aid livestock farmers in building a million dollar slaughterhouse, his government contributed three dollars for every dollar the farmers raised. His government also created a provincial parks system.

Stanfield&#x27;s government introduced hospital insurance, as well as a provincial sales tax (also known as the Hospital Tax) to fund half of it (with the other half being funded by the federal government). The PST, which became effective on January 1, 1959, was initially 5 percent but was later raised to 7 percent. The PST applied to all goods and services except food and children&#x27;s clothing.

Stanfield strongly opposed the Bell Telephone Company&#x27;s takeover bid of Nova Scotia&#x27;s Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Company (M.T. &amp; T.) in 1966, arguing that a takeover would lead to sharp increases in the cost of the service. After the Bell declined to negotiate with his government within a five-day time frame, Stanfield called a special session in the legislature; during the session, the legislature passed a bill that prevented the Bell from taking control of M.T. &amp; T., allowing the latter to remain in Nova Scotian control.

====Human rights====

Stanfield prioritized human rights, particularly for Black Nova Scotians. In 1959, Stanfield&#x27;s government passed the &quot;Fair Accommodation Practices Act&quot; to protect against discrimination in public spaces. In 1962, Stanfield created and led the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights to support the work of William Oliver and other Black Nova Scotians. The year later, Stanfield&#x27;s government codified and extended earlier legislation in the first &quot;Human Rights Act of 1963&quot;. In 1965, the Stanfield government established the Education fund for Negros and in 1967, created the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission with Oliver.

====Education policy====

Stanfield&#x27;s government increased funding for schools and training colleges. His government started to contribute funding towards universities beginning in 1960; between 1960 and 1967, the Stanfield government&#x27;s contributions towards universities jumped from $250,000 to $25,000,000. His government also introduced a capital assistance program in which the government would fund up to 90 percent of the cost of university buildings. In addition, Stanfield&#x27;s government improved French-language education in Nova Scotia by introducing French textbooks (previously, Nova Scotia schools only offered English textbooks) and expanding French-language education to Grade 12 (up from Grade 8).

==Leader of the Official Opposition (1967–1976)==

===1967 Progressive Conservative leadership convention===

Stanfield did not express interest in entering federal politics during the early and mid-1960s. He turned down the federal Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) leader and then-prime minister John Diefenbaker&#x27;s proposal that he should enter federal politics in the 1962 federal election, and did not express interest in becoming party leader (when the idea was suggested by former PC minister Alvin Hamilton) following the Diefenbaker-led PCs&#x27; second defeat in the 1965 federal election.

In the mid-1960s, the federal Progressive Conservative Party was racked by disunity between supporters and opponents of Diefenbaker. A vocal opponent of Diefenbaker was party president Dalton Camp, who forced a leadership convention for 1967. Camp was a strong proponent of a potential Stanfield leadership bid. After months of hesitating, Stanfield finally bowed to Camp&#x27;s pressure and on July 17, 1967, announced his intention to run for leader, on the condition that his finance minister George Isaac Smith agrees to succeed him as premier. Stanfield had strong delegate support in the Atlantic provinces but struggled in the Prairies and Quebec. Nonetheless, on the convention that was held on September 9, he led on the first four ballots, and won on the fifth ballot, taking 54.3 percent of the delegate vote. Stanfield resigned as premier on September 13.

===Early months===

Stanfield was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election for the riding of Colchester—Hants on November 6, 1967. He brought the Progressive Conservatives high in the polls, prompting many to expect him to defeat the Liberal government of the aging Lester B. Pearson. In February 1968, Stanfield almost forced an election after defeating Pearson&#x27;s government on a tax bill, leading to several days of confusion over whether or not this counted as a &quot;de facto&quot; motion of no confidence in the government. Ultimately, it was ruled by the Governor General, Roland Michener that it did not, and while Stanfield immediately called an explicit motion of no confidence in Pearson&#x27;s government, it failed to pass after the New Democratic Party and &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot; declined to support it.

===1968 federal election===

Pearson would soon retire, prompting the Liberals to choose Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau as its new leader in April 1968. Trudeau subsequently called an election for June 25. Trudeau was a charismatic intellectual and perfectly bilingual. Stanfield&#x27;s unilingualism and uninspiring speaking style (according to Stanfield biographer Geoffrey Stevens) contrasted poorly with the new Liberal leader. The PCs started the election campaign with an internal poll showing them trailing the Liberals by 22 points.

Stanfield proposed introducing guaranteed annual income, though failed to explain the number of citizens that would be covered, the minimum income level, and the cost to implement it. Due to concerns that the term &quot;guaranteed annual income&quot; sounded socialist, he eventually switched to using the term &quot;negative income tax&quot;. These mistakes made the policy impossible for voters to understand and harmed the PCs. What also damaged the PCs was the idea of &quot;deux nations&quot; (meaning that Canada was one country housing two nations - French Canadians and English-speaking Canadians). Marcel Faribault, the PCs&#x27; Quebec lieutenant and MP candidate, was unclear on whether he supported or opposed &quot;deux nations&quot; and Stanfield did not drop him as a candidate. This led to the Liberals positioning themselves as the party that supported one Canada. In mid-June, they ran a full-page newspaper advertisement that implied that Stanfield supported &quot;deux nations&quot;; Stanfield called the ad &quot;a deliberate lie&quot; and insisted he supported one Canada.

On election night, the Liberals increased their support to form a strong majority government. Though the PCs&#x27; popular vote share slightly dropped from 32.4 percent in 1965 to 31.4 percent, their seat count considerably reduced from 94 to 72. The PCs dominated Atlantic Canada but saw a significant decline in popularity in Ontario (as the party&#x27;s performance in that province was the worst in their history), Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

===1968–1972===

After losing the 1968 election, Stanfield vacationed in Quebec where he participated in French immersion classes. He vigorously backed official bilingualism and the Liberals&#x27; 1969 &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; which made French an official language in Canada, arguing the act would strengthen Canadian unity. To his disappointment, 17 out of 72 PC MPs (including his predecessor as leader, John Diefenbaker), voted against the bill.

In 1969, Stanfield was one of 12 out of 72 PC MPs to vote in favour of the Trudeau government&#x27;s Bill C-150, which decriminalized homosexuality and allowed abortion under certain conditions.

Stanfield initially supported the Trudeau government&#x27;s October 1970 invocation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; to deal with the October Crisis but later regretted doing so.

===1972 federal election===

In the election of 1972, Stanfield&#x27;s Tories campaigned on the public&#x27;s perception that the Liberals were mismanaging the economy as a result of rising unemployment. Though the Liberals started with a 10-point lead over the Progressive Conservatives, the election, held on October 30, saw the PCs win 107 seats and come two seats behind the Liberals who won 109 seats; this was one of the closest elections in Canadian history. The Liberals were able to form a minority government due to them getting support from the New Democratic Party led by David Lewis. In the election, Stanfield refused to sign the nomination papers of former Moncton mayor Leonard Jones; Jones had won the party nomination but he refused to support official bilingualism which was part of PC policy.

===1974 federal election===

In May 1974, the House of Commons passed a motion of no confidence in the Trudeau government, defeating its budget bill after Trudeau intentionally antagonized Stanfield and Lewis. This triggered an election for July 8. The election focused mainly on the current economic recession, and Stanfield proposed to immediately introduce 90-day wage and price controls to help reduce the increasing inflation of the era. Trudeau mocked the proposal, saying to a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying &quot;Zap! You&#x27;re frozen&quot;, and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation. According to Trudeau’s biographer John English, NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals during the campaign. Trudeau, in an abrupt reversal, would implement wage and price controls in December 1975 through the passing of the &quot;Anti-Inflation Act&quot;.

During the campaign, on May 30, 1974, a photo by photojournalist Doug Ball showing Stanfield fumbling a football thrown by Geoffrey Stevens at a stopover in North Bay, Ontario, became one of the defining images of his career. To this day, Canadian political commentators still point to this incident as one of Canada&#x27;s foremost examples of &quot;image politics&quot;, because the photo was chosen for the front pages of newspapers across Canada even though many other photos of Stanfield catching the same football were also available.

The election result showed the Liberals had boosted their support from a minority to a majority government, while the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; seat count dropped from 106 to 95. The Progressive Conservatives did well in the Atlantic provinces, and in the West, but strong Liberal support in Ontario and Quebec ensured a Liberal majority government.

===Political ideology===

Political science professor Ron Dart described Stanfield&#x27;s political philosophy in the 1968 election as a &quot;sort of Pink Toryism&quot;. Historian J. Murray Beck wrote about Stanfield, &quot;Eschewing highly doctrinaire politics, his conservatism, which caused him to be called a &quot;pink&quot; if not a Red Tory, was above all a compassionate conservatism with a genuine concern for the disadvantaged.&quot; In a 1976 interview with &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Stanfield stated, &quot;Increasing the size of the GNP is important, but it is not in itself a sufficient goal for a civilized society.&quot;

===Retirement===
On August 14, 1974, over a month after the election, Stanfield announced his intention to resign as party leader. During the news conference, he stated his preference for a French Canadian successor as leader. He served as leader of the PCs and leader of the Opposition until February 22, 1976, when he was permanently succeeded as leader by Joe Clark. Stanfield retired from Parliament in the May 1979 election which finally brought the Progressive Conservatives to power (though they would lose the February 1980 election to the Trudeau-led Liberals who won a majority).

==Later years (1976–2003)==

After his retirement, Stanfield stayed out of politics until the constitutional debates, when he endorsed and campaigned for the Meech Lake Accord, the Charlottetown Accord, and free trade. He said that the Meech Lake Accord was a second chance to save Canada from disaster. &quot;I&#x27;m not at all sure that I would want to live in a country that rejected Meech Lake,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be the Canada I grew up in. It wouldn&#x27;t be the country with the values that I&#x27;ve loved during my life.&quot; Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wanted to appoint Stanfield as U.N. ambassador saying, &quot;I tried to engage him further but he was leading a vigorous life and a very active life and he didn&#x27;t want to change after a while.&quot;

From 1983 to 1987, Stanfield served as chairman of the Institute for Research on Public Policy. He also served as the first Canadian chairman of the Commonwealth Foundation from December 1986 to 1991.

===Illness and death===
In 1996, Stanfield suffered a debilitating stroke that left him severely disabled. He died on December 16, 2003, at Montfort Hospital in Ottawa, from pneumonia, only nine days after the Progressive Conservative Party merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the new Conservative Party of Canada. Fellow Nova Scotian — and final PC Party Leader — Peter MacKay suggested in an interview on CBC Newsworld&#x27;s December 17, 2003 Morning Show that he had not personally spoken to Stanfield in regard to his opinions on the merger. It is unknown what Stanfield thought of the creation of the new Conservatives. His funeral service was held in Ottawa, and then he was buried in Camp Hill Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia, next to his first wife Joyce Frazee, mother of his four children: Sarah, Max, Judith and Miriam, and with his second wife Mary Hall.

==Personal life==
Stanfield married Joyce Frazee in 1940, but she died in a car accident in 1954. During his term as premier, Stanfield remarried, exchanging vows with Mary Hall in 1957. Mary Stanfield died of cancer in 1977, and the following year, Stanfield married his third wife, Anne Austin. Anne Austin Stanfield died, age 89, April 22, 2021.

==Honours==
In July 1967, Stanfield and other provincial premiers were sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on the occasion of Canada&#x27;s centennial.

On July 1, 1992, as part of Canada&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations, the Queen on advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney granted Stanfield and six former cabinet ministers (Alvin Hamilton, Ellen Fairclough, Jack Pickersgill, Paul Martin Sr., Jean-Luc Pepin and Martial Asselin) the right to use the title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. He is one of nine Canadians entitled to the title without having held an office which such title is automatically conferred (the other two being former Deputy Prime Ministers Donald Mazankowski and Herb Gray).

In 2007, Halifax Robert L. Stanfield International Airport was named after him by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (FRCGS).

<text>Qawasameh tribe (, also spelled: Qawasmeh or Kawasmeh in English), is a major clan primarily based in Hebron, with roughly 10,000 members. Although many of the Qawasmeh were originally pro-peace moderates and supporters of a two-state solution, they were radicalised. One tribe faction, numbering several hundred, dominates Hamas in Hebron and is a radical opposition faction within Hamas, which frequently sabotages Hamas cease fires with bombings and attacks, provoking Israeli retaliation. 

The Shin Bet has accused them of kidnapping the Yeshiva students. Marwan Qawasameh is suspected of being one of two terrorists involved in the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens on June 12, 2014.

According to the IDF, Abbedalla Qawasameh was killed in June 2003 by the Yamam elite CT unit after resisting an arrest. He opened fire on the Yamam officers who returned fire and killed him. According to Palestinian witnesses, however, a squad of Israeli police disguised as Palestinian labourers opened fire on him as he left a Hebron mosque. The controversial assassination led to criticism of Israel from U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.

On August 31, 2004, Ahmed Abed Qawasameh, a resident of the Hebron District, blew himself up in a suicide bombing attack at Beersheba, which claimed the lives of 16 Israeli civilians. He was sent by the local Hamas leader Imad Qawasameh.

On October 13, 2004, Imad Qawasameh was arrested by IDF forces, after intelligence was provided by the Shin Bet. According to witnesses, Imad surrendered immediately after an IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozer started to demolish his house.

In 2011, the IDF broke into Omar Qawasameh″s home, put a gun to his wife&#x27;s head and shot him dead in his sleep. Subsequently, the Israeli army released a statement acknowledging the Qawasameh killing was unintended. An Israeli military spokesman told the AFP news agency: &quot;There is no indication that [al-Qawasmeh] was involved in any terror activity at any stage and therefore we regret the incident.&quot;

The Qawasameh extremist wing are the main suppliers of militants to the Hebron cells of Hamas.

==Notable Qawasameh Hamas members==
* Fahd Qawasmi (mayor of Hebron, PLO Executive committee member, deceased)
* Hamza Qawasameh (killed Netanel Uzari, deceased)
* Marwan Qawasameh (suspected of being one of two terrorists involved in the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens, deceased)
* Raad Misk Qawasameh (suicide bomber, deceased)
* Abbedalla Qawasameh (leader, deceased)
* Bassal Qawasameh (leader, deceased)
* Ahmed Abed Qawasameh (suicide bomber in Beersheba, deceased)

<doc id="405736" wikidata="Q10728581" url="?curid=405736" title="Perverting the course of justice">
<text>Perverting the course of justice is an offence committed when a person prevents justice from being served on themselves or on another party. In England and Wales it is a common law offence, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Statutory versions of the offence exist in Australia, Canada, Fiji, Ireland, and New Zealand. The Scottish equivalent is defeating the ends of justice, although charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice are also raised in Scotland, while the South African counterpart is defeating or obstructing the course of justice. A similar concept, obstruction of justice, exists in United States law.

==England and Wales==
Doing an act tending and intending to pervert the course of public justice is an offence under the common law of England and Wales.

Perverting the course of justice can be any of three acts:
* Fabricating or disposing of evidence
* Intimidating or threatening a witness or juror
* Intimidating or threatening a judge

Also criminal are:
* Conspiring with another to pervert the course of justice, and
* Intending to pervert the course of justice

This offence, and the subject matter of the related forms of criminal conspiracy, have been referred to as: 
*Perverting the course of justice
*Interfering with the administration of justice
*Obstructing the administration of justice
*Obstructing the course of justice
*Defeating the due course of justice
*Defeating the ends of justice
*Effecting a public mischief

This proliferation of alternative names has been described as &quot;somewhat confusing&quot;.

This offence is also sometimes referred to as &quot;attempting to pervert the course of justice&quot;. This is potentially misleading. An attempt to pervert the course of justice is a substantive common law offence and not an inchoate offence. It is not a form of the offence of attempt, and it would be erroneous to charge it as being contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.

This offence is triable only on indictment.

==Canada==
In Canada, the equivalent offence is referred to as &quot;obstructing justice&quot;. It is set out in § 139 of the Criminal Code:

==Australia==
In New South Wales, the equivalent offence is set out in Section 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty is 14 years&#x27; imprisonment. In 1985 Murray Farquhar, the former Chief Stipendiary Magistrate of New South Wales, was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice to have charges against Kevin Humphreys dismissed and sentenced to a maximum of four years in prison. In 2009 Marcus Einfeld, a former Judge of the Federal Court of Australia, was sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison after pleading guilty to making a false statement with intent to pervert the course of justice.

==International Criminal Court==

In 2020, International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda described attempted interference with ICC witnesses in the Kenya investigation as perverting the course of justice under Article 70 of the Rome Statute, which defines the legal context of the ICC. Arrest warrants were issued against three people for their alleged attempts to make witnesses withdraw statements or refuse to testify to the court.

==Notable convictions==
*Jonathan Aitken, a politician and British government cabinet ministerperjury and perverting the course of justice
*Jeffrey Archer, an English author and former politicianperjury and perverting the course of justice
*Ali Dizaei, a former commander in London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Serviceinitially found guilty of perverting the course of justice and jailed; later released on appeal; subsequently re-convicted
*Chris Huhne, a journalist and former British government cabinet minister and his former wife, Vicky Pryceperverting the course of justice (see &quot;R v Huhne and Pryce&quot;)
*John Humble, a former labourerperverting the course of justice
*Bruce Hyman, an English barristerperverting the course of justice
*Karen Matthews and Michael Donovanfound guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment, and perverting the course of justice

Australia
*Marcus Einfeld, an Australian retired Federal Court and NSW, WA and ACT Supreme Court judgeperjury and perverting the course of justice, for lying relative to a speeding ticket
*Lionel Murphy, an Australian former politician and High Court of Australia judgeinitially found guilty of perverting the course of justice; the NSW Appeal Court subsequently quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial; subsequently found not guilty

<doc id="405737" wikidata="Q2256719" url="?curid=405737" title="Exact differential">
<text>In multivariate calculus, a differential or differential form is said to be exact or perfect (&quot;exact differential&quot;), as contrasted with an inexact differential, if it is equal to the general differential formula_1 for some differentiable function formula_2 in an orthogonal coordinate system (hence formula_2 is a multivariable function whose variables are independent, as they are always expected to be when treated in multivariable calculus).

An exact differential is sometimes also called a &quot;total differential&quot;, or a &quot;full differential&quot;, or, in the study of differential geometry, it is termed an exact form.

The integral of an exact differential over any integral path is path-independent, and this fact is used to identify state functions in thermodynamics.

==Overview==

===Definition===
Even if we work in three dimensions here, the definitions of exact differentials for other dimensions are structurally similar to the three dimensional definition. In three dimensions, a form of the type
formula_4
is called a differential form. This form is called &quot;exact&quot; on an open domain formula_5 in space if there exists some differentiable scalar function formula_6 defined on formula_7 such that
formula_8
throughout formula_7, where formula_10 are orthogonal coordinates (e.g., Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates). In other words, in some open domain of a space, a differential form is an &quot;exact differential&quot; if it is equal to the general differential of a differentiable function in an orthogonal coordinate system.

The subscripts outside the parenthesis in the above mathematical expression indicate which variables are being held constant during differentiation. Due to the definition of the partial derivative, these subscripts are not required, but they are explicitly shown here as reminders.

=== Integral path independence ===
The exact differential for a differentiable scalar function formula_2 defined in an open domain formula_12 is equal to formula_13, where formula_14 is the gradient of formula_2, formula_16 represents the scalar product, and formula_17 is the general differential displacement vector, if an orthogonal coordinate system is used. If formula_18 is of differentiability class formula_19 (continuously differentiable), then formula_14 is a conservative vector field for the corresponding potential formula_2 by the definition. For three dimensional spaces, expressions such as formula_22 and formula_23 can be made.

The gradient theorem states

:formula_24

that does not depend on which integral path between the given path endpoints formula_25 and formula_26 is chosen. So it is concluded that &quot;the integral of an exact differential is independent of the choice of an integral path between given path endpoints (path independence).&quot;

For three dimensional spaces, if formula_14 defined on an open domain formula_5 is of differentiability class formula_19 (equivalently formula_2 is of formula_31), then this integral path independence can also be proved by using the vector calculus identity formula_32 and Stokes&#x27; theorem.

:formula_33
for a simply closed loop formula_34 with the smooth oriented surface formula_35 in it. If the open domain formula_7 is simply connected open space (roughly speaking, a single piece open space without a hole within it), then any irrotational vector field (defined as a formula_19 vector field formula_38 which curl is zero, i.e., formula_39) has the path independence by the Stokes&#x27; theorem, so the following statement is made; &quot;In a simply connected open region, any&quot; formula_19 &quot;vector field that has the path-independence property (so it is a conservative vector field.) must also be irrotational and vice versa.&quot; The equality of the path independence and conservative vector fields is shown here.

==== Thermodynamic state function ====
In thermodynamics, when formula_1 is exact, the function formula_2 is a state function of the system: a mathematical function which depends solely on the current equilibrium state, not on the path taken to reach that state. Internal energy formula_43, Entropy formula_44, Enthalpy formula_45, Helmholtz free energy formula_46, and Gibbs free energy formula_47 are state functions. Generally, neither work formula_48 nor heat formula_2 is a state function. (Note: formula_2 is commonly used to represent heat in physics. It should not be confused with the use earlier in this article as the parameter of an exact differential.)

===One dimension===
In one dimension, a differential form
:formula_51
is exact if and only if formula_46 has an antiderivative (but not necessarily one in terms of elementary functions). If formula_46 has an antiderivative and let formula_2 be an antiderivative of formula_46 so formula_56, then formula_51 obviously satisfies the condition for exactness. If formula_46 does &quot;not&quot; have an antiderivative, then we cannot write formula_59 with formula_60 for a differentiable function formula_2 so formula_51 is inexact.

===Two and three dimensions===
By symmetry of second derivatives, for any &quot;well-behaved&quot; (non-pathological) function formula_2, we have

: formula_64

Hence, in a simply-connected region &quot;R&quot; of the &quot;xy&quot;-plane, where formula_65 are independent, a differential form

:formula_66

is an exact differential if and only if the equation

:formula_67

holds. If it is an exact differential so formula_68 and formula_69, then formula_2 is a differentiable (smoothly continuous) function along formula_71 and formula_72, so formula_73. If formula_67 holds, then formula_46 and formula_76 are differentiable (again, smoothly continuous) functions along formula_72 and formula_71 respectively, and formula_73 is only the case.

For three dimensions, in a simply-connected region &quot;R&quot; of the &quot;xyz&quot;-coordinate system, by a similar reason, a differential

:formula_80

is an exact differential if and only if between the functions &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; there exist the relations

:formula_81; formula_82; formula_83

These conditions are equivalent to the following sentence: If &quot;G&quot; is the graph of this vector valued function then for all tangent vectors &quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; of the &quot;surface&quot; &quot;G&quot; then &quot;s&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) = 0 with &quot;s&quot; the symplectic form.

These conditions, which are easy to generalize, arise from the independence of the order of differentiations in the calculation of the second derivatives. So, in order for a differential &quot;dQ&quot;, that is a function of four variables, to be an exact differential, there are six conditions (the combination formula_84) to satisfy.

==Partial differential relations==

If a differentiable function formula_85 is one-to-one (injective) for each independent variable, e.g., formula_85 is one-to-one for formula_71 at a fixed formula_72 while it is not necessarily one-to-one for formula_89, then the following total differentials exist because each independent variable is a differentiable function for the other variables, e.g., formula_90.

:formula_91
:formula_92

Substituting the first equation into the second and rearranging, we obtain

:formula_93
:formula_94
:formula_95
Since formula_72 and formula_97 are independent variables, formula_98 and formula_99 may be chosen without restriction. For this last equation to generally hold, the bracketed terms must be equal to zero. The left bracket equal to zero leads to the reciprocity relation while the right bracket equal to zero goes to the cyclic relation as shown below.

===Reciprocity relation===
Setting the first term in brackets equal to zero yields

:formula_100

A slight rearrangement gives a reciprocity relation,

:formula_101

There are two more permutations of the foregoing derivation that give a total of three reciprocity relations between formula_71, formula_72 and formula_97.

===Cyclic relation===
The cyclic relation is also known as the cyclic rule or the Triple product rule. Setting the second term in brackets equal to zero yields

:formula_105

Using a reciprocity relation for formula_106 on this equation and reordering gives a cyclic relation (the triple product rule),

:formula_107

If, &quot;instead&quot;, reciprocity relations for formula_108 and formula_109 are used with subsequent rearrangement, a standard form for implicit differentiation is obtained:

:formula_110

== Some useful equations derived from exact differentials in two dimensions ==

(See also Bridgman&#x27;s thermodynamic equations for the use of exact differentials in the theory of thermodynamic equations)

Suppose we have five state functions formula_111, and formula_112. Suppose that the state space is two-dimensional and any of the five quantities are differentiable. Then by the chain rule

{{NumBlk|:|formula_113|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

but also by the chain rule:

{{NumBlk|:|formula_114|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

and

{{NumBlk|:|formula_115|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

so that (by substituting (2) and (3) into (1)):

{{NumBlk|:|formula_116|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

which implies that (by comparing (4) with (1)):

{{NumBlk|:|formula_117|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

Letting formula_118 in (5) gives:

{{NumBlk|:|formula_119|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Letting formula_120 in (5) gives:

{{NumBlk|:|formula_121|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

Letting formula_120 and formula_123 in (7) gives:

{{NumBlk|:|formula_124|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

using (formula_125 gives the triple product rule:

{{NumBlk|:|formula_126|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

<doc id="405742" wikidata="Q2296308" url="?curid=405742" title="Web Feature Service">
<text>In computing, the Open Geospatial Consortium Web Feature Service (WFS) Interface Standard provides an interface allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls. One can think of geographical features as the &quot;source code&quot; behind a map, whereas the WMS interface or online tiled mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze. The XML-based Geography Markup Language (GML) furnishes the default payload-encoding for transporting geographic features, but other formats like shapefiles can also serve for transport. In early 2006 the OGC members approved the OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile. This profile is designed both to increase interoperability between WFS servers and to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard.

The OGC membership defined and maintains the WFS specification. Numerous commercial and open-source implementations of the WFS interface standard exist, including the open-source reference implementations GeoServer and deegree. The OGC Implementing Products page
provides a comprehensive list of WFS implementations.

==Overview ==
The WFS specification defines interfaces for describing data manipulation operations of geographic features. Data manipulation operations include the ability to:

* get or query features based on spatial and non-spatial constraints
* create a new feature instance
* delete a feature instance
* update a feature instance

The basic Web Feature Service allows querying and retrieval of features. A transactional Web Feature Service (WFS-T) allows creation, deletion, and updating of features.

A WFS describes discovery, query, or data transformation operations. The client generates the request and posts it to a web feature server using HTTP. The web feature server then executes the request. The WFS specification uses HTTP as the distributed computing platform, although this is not a hard requirement.

There are two encodings defined for WFS operations:
* XML (amenable to HTTP POST, or SOAP)
* Key/value pairs (encoded in HTTP GET query strings, to perform remote procedure calls)

In the taxonomy of Web Services, WFS is best categorized as a non-RESTful RPC type service.

=== Communication models===
The WFS Web Feature Services or Web Feature Server specification supports two communication models:
*Stateless Request Reply
*Pub/Sub
::A messaging system in which clients address messages to a specific node in a content hierarchy, called a topic. Publishers and subscribers are generally anonymous and can dynamically publish or subscribe to the content hierarchy. The system takes care of distributing the messages arriving from a node&#x27;s multiple publishers to its multiple subscribers. Messages are generally not persistent and will only be received by subscribers who are listening at the time the message is sent. A special case known as a “durable subscription” allows subscribers to receive messages sent while the subscribers are not active. (Source: Oracle Technology Network for Java Developers | Oracle Technology Network | Oracle)

The Web Notification Service (WNS) is one of the implementation specifications for the Pub/Sub model. Regardless of the model, URL format is used and specified in the WFS specification. At this time there are no open-standard implementations of WNSs. Vendors plan to release implementations once the standard has been ratified.

===Data ===
Data passed between a Web Feature Server and a client is encoded with Geography Markup Language (GML), an XML dialect which can be used to model geographic features.

The 1.0.0 version of the WFS specification requires the use of GML version 2.1.2, while the 1.1.0 version of the WFS specification requires the use of GML version 3.1.1. For both versions of the WFS specification, an arbitrary number of other encodings can also be defined, in addition to the required GML 2.1.2 or 3.1.1 format (for 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 respectively).

GML 2.1.2 contains encoding support for basic geometric &#x27;primitives&#x27;: points, lines, polygons, etc.

GML 3.1.1 contains encoding support for more advanced geometric representations: curves, surfaces, multi-dimensions (time, elevation, multi-band imagery). In addition, GML 3.1.1 includes encoding support for topologically integrated datasets.

== Public Interfaces==

===Static Interfaces ===
The static interface model for the OGC Web Service model appears in the figure below.

The Transaction and LockFeature operations are also optional.

When writing a WFS, you must implement the following operations:
*GetCapabilities - this queries the WFS service to determine available options.
*DescribeFeatureType - this retrieves the XML schema to allow the WFS client to parse the resultsets.
*GetFeature - this performs the actual query - parameters such as bounding box and any other filters should be passed in, as appropriate, and the WFS service then returns a GML resultset containing full geometry and feature attributes.

===Dynamic interface updates ===
The client gets updates by one of two mechanisms:
*Notification: Recommended but not mandatory. Depends on the availability of a WNS implementation.
*Polling: Use this method if a WNS implementation is not available.

WFS dynamic interface web notification model

This model uses the OGC Web Notification Service to send update notifications to registered clients.

<doc id="405744" wikidata="Q1077842" url="?curid=405744" title="Chris Ware">
<text>Franklin Christenson &quot;Chris&quot; Ware (born December 28, 1967) is an American cartoonist known for his &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; series (begun 1994) and the graphic novels &quot;Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth&quot; (2000), &quot;Building Stories&quot; (2012) and &quot;Rusty Brown&quot; (2019). His works explore themes of social isolation, emotional torment and depression. He tends to use a vivid color palette and realistic, meticulous detail. His lettering and images are often elaborate and sometimes evoke the ragtime era or another early 20th-century American design style.

Ware often refers to himself in the publicity for his work in self-effacing, even withering tones. He is considered by some critics and fellow notable illustrators and writers, such as Dave Eggers, to be among the best currently working in the medium; Canadian graphic-novelist Seth has said, &quot;Chris really changed the playing field. After him, a lot of [cartoonists] really started to scramble and go, &#x27;Holy [expletive], I think I have to try harder.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Ware resides in the Chicago area of Illinois. His earliest published strips appeared in the late 1980s on the comics page of &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, the student newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin. In addition to numerous daily strips under different titles, Ware also had a weekly satirical science fiction serial in the paper titled &quot;Floyd Farland - Citizen of the Future&quot;. This was eventually published in 1988 as a prestige format comic book from Eclipse Comics, and its publication even led to a brief correspondence between Ware and Timothy Leary.

While still a sophomore at UT, Ware came to the attention of Art Spiegelman, who invited Ware to contribute to &quot;Raw&quot;, the influential anthology magazine Spiegelman was co-editing with Françoise Mouly. Ware has acknowledged that being included in &quot;Raw&quot; gave him confidence and inspired him to explore printing techniques and self-publishing. His Fantagraphics series &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; defied comics publishing conventions with every issue. The series featured a combination of new material as well as reprints of work Ware had done for the &quot;Texan&quot; (such as &quot;Quimby the Mouse&quot;) and the Chicago weekly paper &quot;Newcity&quot;. Ware&#x27;s work appeared originally in &quot;Newcity&quot; before he moved on to his current &quot;home&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. Beginning with the 16th issue of &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;, Ware began self-publishing his work while maintaining a relationship with Fantagraphics for distribution and storage. This was a return to Ware&#x27;s early career, self-publishing such books as &quot;Lonely Comics and Stories&quot; as well as miniature digests of stories based on Quimby the Mouse and an unnamed potato-like creature.

In recent years he has also been involved in editing (and designing) several books and book series, including the new reprint series of &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; from Drawn &amp; Quarterly titled &quot;Walt and Skeezix&quot;; a reprint series of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; by Fantagraphics; and the 13th volume of &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;, which is devoted to comics. He was the editor of &quot;The Best American Comics 2007&quot;, the second installment devoted to comics in the &quot;Best American&quot; series.

In 2007, Ware curated an exhibition for the Phoenix Art Museum focused on the non-comic work of five contemporary cartoonists. The exhibition, titled &quot;UnInked: Paintings, Sculpture and Graphic Works by Five Cartoonists&quot;, ran from April 21 through August 19. Ware also edited and designed the catalog for the exhibition.

In 2017, Ware&#x27;s book &quot;Monograph&quot; appeared. It is a part-memoir, part-scrapbook retrospective of his career to that point. The New York Review of Books described it as &quot;a grand tomb in the Egyptian mold, whose contents will tell anyone who breaks into it what this person’s life was like,&quot; adding that &quot;it seems almost an invasion of privacy to enter this crypt.&quot;

==Style==
Ware&#x27;s art reflects early 20th-century American styles of cartooning and graphic design, shifting through formats from traditional comic panels to faux advertisements and cut-out toys. Stylistic influences include advertising graphics from that same era; newspaper strip cartoonists Winsor McCay (&quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;) and Frank King (&quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;); Charles Schulz&#x27;s post-WWII strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; and the cover designs of ragtime-era sheet music. Ware has spoken about finding inspiration in the work of artist Joseph Cornell and cites Richard McGuire&#x27;s strip &quot;Here&quot; as a major influence on his use of non-linear narratives. Ware has said of his own style:I arrived at my way of &quot;working&quot; as a way of visually approximating what I feel the tone of fiction to be in prose versus the tone one might use to write biography; I would never do a biographical story using the deliberately synthetic way of cartooning I use to write fiction. I try to use the rules of typography to govern the way that I &quot;draw&quot;, which keeps me at a sensible distance from the story as well as being a visual analog to the way we remember and conceptualize the world. I figured out this way of working by learning from and looking at artists I admired and whom I thought came closest to getting at what seemed to me to be the &quot;essence&quot; of comics, which is fundamentally the weird process of reading pictures, not just looking at them. I see the black outlines of cartoons as visual approximations of the way we remember general ideas, and I try to use naturalistic color underneath them to simultaneously suggest a perceptual experience, which I think is more or less the way we actually experience the world as adults; we don&#x27;t really &quot;see&quot; anymore after a certain age, we spend our time naming and categorizing and identifying and figuring how everything all fits together. Unfortunately, as a result, I guess sometimes readers get a chilled or antiseptic sensation from it, which is certainly not intentional, and is something I admit as a failure, but is also something I can&#x27;t completely change at the moment.

Although his precise, geometrical layouts may appear to some to be computer-generated, Ware works almost exclusively with manual drawing tools such as paper and ink, rulers and T-squares. He does, however, sometimes use photocopies and transparencies, and he employs a computer to color his strips.

==Recurring characters and stories==
===Quimby the Mouse===
Quimby the Mouse was an early character for Ware and something of a breakthrough. Rendered in the style of an early animation character like Felix the Cat, Quimby the Mouse is perhaps Ware&#x27;s most autobiographical character. Quimby&#x27;s relationship with a cat head named Sparky is by turns conflict-ridden and loving, and thus intended to reflect all human relationships. While Quimby exhibits mobility, Sparky remains immobile and helpless, subject to all the indignities Quimby visits upon him. Quimby also acts as a narrator for Ware&#x27;s reminiscences of his youth, in particular his relationship with his grandmother. Sometimes illustrated as a two-headed mouse, Quimby embodies both Ware and his grandmother, and the duality of a young and old body. Quimby was presented in a series of smaller panels than most comics, almost providing the illusion of motion à la a zoetrope. In fact, Ware once designed a zoetrope to be cut out and constructed by the reader in order to watch a Quimby &quot;silent movie&quot;. Ware&#x27;s ingenuity is neatly shown in this willingness to break from the confines of the page. Quimby the Mouse appears in the logo of a Chicago-based bookstore &quot;Quimby&#x27;s&quot;, although their shared name was originally a coincidence.

===Rusty Brown===
Ware&#x27;s &quot;Rusty Brown&quot; focuses on the titular character, examining his life in the present and through flashbacks of his childhood, focusing on his arrested development and attachment to cultural objects. As the story expands, it diverges into multiple storylines about Brown&#x27;s father&#x27;s early life in the 1950s as a science fiction writer (&quot;Acme Novelty Library #19&quot;) and his best friend Chalky White&#x27;s adult home life. The first part of &quot;Rusty Brown&quot; was published in book form in 2019 by Pantheon Books.

===Building Stories===
Ware&#x27;s &quot;Building Stories&quot; was serialized in a host of different venues. It first appeared as a monthly strip in &quot;Nest Magazine&quot;. Installments later appeared in a number of publications, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Kramer&#x27;s Ergot&quot;, and most notably, the Sunday &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. &quot;Building Stories&quot; appeared weekly in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; from September 18, 2005 until April 16, 2006. A full chapter was published in &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;, number 18. Another installment was published under the title &quot;Touch Sensitive&quot; as a digital app released through McSweeneys. The entire narrative was published as a boxed set of books by Pantheon in October 2012. The boxed set holds 14 different works, in various sizes and forms, weaving through the life of an unnamed brown haired woman.

===&quot;The Last Saturday&quot;===
Ware&#x27;s latest project, &quot;The Last Saturday&quot;, a &quot;comic novella,&quot; began appearing online every Friday at the website of the UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, starting in September 2014. The story follows a few people in Sandy Port, Michigan: Putnam Gray, a young boy caught up in his sci-fi and space fantasies; Sandy Grains, a young girl and classmate who is interested in Putnam; Rosie Gentry, a young girl and classmate with whom Putnam is infatuated; Mr. and Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Grains. The strip also features in the newspaper&#x27;s Weekend magazine.

The serialization has now apparently ended after 54 instalments. The bottom right-hand corner of the last page has a note that says, &quot;END, PART ONE&quot;, but , there appears to be no indication from &quot;The Guardian&quot; or from Ware that there is to be a Part Two.

==Non-comics work==
Ware is an ardent collector of ragtime paraphernalia and occasionally publishes a journal devoted to the music titled &quot;The Ragtime Ephemeralist&quot;. He also plays the banjo and piano. The influence of the music and the graphics of its era can be seen in Ware&#x27;s work, especially in regard to logos and layout. Ware has designed album covers and posters for such ragtime performers as the Et Cetera String Band, Virginia Tichenor, Reginald R. Robinson, the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra and Guido Nielsen.

He has also designed covers and posters for non-ragtime performers such as Andrew Bird&#x27;s Bowl of Fire and 5ive Style. In October 2005 Ware designed the elaborate cover art for Penguin Books&#x27; new edition of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;.

Ware was commissioned by Chip Kidd to design the inner machinations of the bird on the cover of Haruki Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot;.

In 2003-04, Ware worked with Ira Glass of &quot;This American Life&quot; and Chicago historian Tim Samuelson to illustrate and design &quot;Lost Buildings&quot; about Samuelson and the preservation of Chicago&#x27;s old buildings, particularly Louis Sullivan&#x27;s buildings. Originally produced for a live &quot;Lost in America&quot; stage show in 2003, &quot;Lost Buildings&quot; was later published as a book and DVD. In 2007-08, he produced animations for the &quot;This American Life&quot; television series on Showtime and also contributed to the show as a color consultant. Ware created poster art for Tamara Jenkins&#x27; 2007 film &quot;The Savages&quot; and her 2018 film &quot;Private Life&quot;.

===Mural for 826 Valencia===
Dave Eggers commissioned Ware to design the mural for the facade of San Francisco literacy project 826 Valencia. The mural depicts &quot;the parallel development of humans and their efforts at and motivations for communication, spoken and written.&quot; The 3.9m x 6m mural was applied by artisans to Ware’s specifications. Describing the work, Ware said &quot;I didn’t want it to make anyone &#x27;feel good&#x27;, especially in that typically muralistic &#x27;hands across the water&#x27; sort of way,&quot;...&quot;I especially wanted it to be something that people living in the neighbourhood could look at day after day and hopefully not tire of too quickly. I really hoped whomever might happen to come across it would find something that showed a respect for their intelligence, and didn’t force-feed them any &#x27;message&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;Fortune&quot; 500 cover===
In 2010, Ware designed the cover for &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Fortune 500&quot; issue, but it was rejected. Ware had mentioned the work at a panel at the Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo on April 16, as first noted in an April 20 blog post by Matthew J. Brady. The cover, featuring the circle-shaped humans common in Ware&#x27;s more broadly socially satirical comic-strips, turned the numbers 500 into skyscrapers looming over the continental United States. On the roofs, corporate bosses drink, dance, and sun themselves as a helicopter drops a shovelful of money down for them. Below, among signs reading &quot;Credit Default Swap Flea Market,&quot; &quot;Greenspan Lube Pro,&quot; and &quot;401K Cemetery,&quot; a helicopter scoops money out of the US Treasury with a shovel, cars pile up in Detroit, and flag-waving citizens party around a boiling tea kettle in the shape of an elephant. In the Gulf of Mexico, homes are sinking, while hooded prisoners sit in Guantanamo, a &quot;Factory of Exploitation&quot; keeps going in Mexico, China is tossing American dollars into the Pacific, and the roof of bankrupted Greece&#x27;s Treasury has blown off. A spokesperson for the magazine only said that, as is their practice, they had commissioned a number of possible covers from different artists, including Ware. Brady wrote in his blog that Ware said at the panel he &quot;accepted the job because it would be like doing the [cover for the] 1929 issue of the magazine&quot;.

===&quot;Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot;===
In 2011, Ware created the poster for the U.S. release of the 2010 film &quot;Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot; by Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Describing the poster, Ware said &quot;I wanted to get at both the transcendent solemnity of the film while keeping some sense of its loose, very unpretentious accessibility... This being a poster, however—and even worse, me not really being a designer—I realized it also had to be somewhat punchy and strange, so as to draw viewers in and pique their curiosity without, hopefully, insulting their intelligence.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Over the years his work garnered several awards, including the 1999 National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Award for Best Comic Book for Acme Novelty Library and Award for Graphic Novel for &quot;Building Stories&quot;.

Ware has won numerous Eisner Awards during his career including Best Artist/Writer in 2009 (&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;) and 2013 (&quot;Building Stories&quot;); Best Artist/Writer-Drama in 2008; Best Continuing Series in 1996 and 2000 (&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;); Best Graphic Album: New in 2000 and 2013 (&quot;Building Stories&quot;); Best Graphic Album: Reprint in 2001 (&quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot;); Best Colorist of 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2006; Best Publication Design in 1995, 1996, 1997 (&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;), 2001 (&quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot;), 2002, 2006 (&quot;Acme Novelty Library Annual Report for Shareholders&quot;) and 2013 (&quot;Building Stories&quot;)

Ware has won multiple Harvey Awards including Best Continuing or Limited Series in 2000 and 2001; Best Cartoonist in 2006 (&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;); Best Letterer in 1996, 2000, 2002, and 2006; Best Colorist in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004 (&quot;Acme Novelty Datebook&quot;); and Special Award for Excellence in Presentation in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 (&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot;), 2001 (&quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot;), 2004 (&quot;Acme Novelty Datebook&quot;) and 2013 (&quot;Building Stories&quot;)

In 2002, Ware became the first comics artist to be invited to exhibit at Whitney Museum of American Art biennial exhibition. With Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Harvey Kurtzman, Robert Crumb and Gary Panter, Ware was among the artists honored in the exhibition &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007. His work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2006 and at the University of Nebraska&#x27;s Sheldon Museum of Art, in 2007.

Ware&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth&quot; won the 2001 Guardian First Book Award, the first time a graphic novel has won a major United Kingdom book award. It also won the 2001 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Outstanding Graphic Novel. And it won the prize for best album at the 2003 Angoulême International Comics Festival in France.

In 2006, Ware received a USA Hoi Fellow grant from United States Artists.

In 2013, Ware received the 2013 Lynd Ward Graphic Novel Prize for &quot;Building Stories&quot; and was finalist for Jan Michalski Prize for Literature and Los Angeles Times Book Prize.

In 2020, Ware&#x27;s Rusty Brown was nominated for the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award.

In 2021, he was awarded the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême for his lifelong achievement.

<doc id="405746" wikidata="Q2328303" url="?curid=405746" title="Analog signal processing">
<text>Analog signal processing is a type of signal processing conducted on continuous analog signals by some analog means (as opposed to the discrete digital signal processing where the signal processing is carried out by a digital process). &quot;Analog&quot; indicates something that is mathematically represented as a set of continuous values. This differs from &quot;digital&quot; which uses a series of discrete quantities to represent signal. Analog values are typically represented as a voltage, electric current, or electric charge around components in the electronic devices. An error or noise affecting such physical quantities will result in a corresponding error in the signals represented by such physical quantities.

Examples of &quot;analog signal processing&quot; include crossover filters in loudspeakers, &quot;bass&quot;, &quot;treble&quot; and &quot;volume&quot; controls on stereos, and &quot;tint&quot; controls on TVs. Common analog processing elements include capacitors, resistors and inductors (as the passive elements) and transistors or op-amps (as the active elements).

==Tools used in analog signal processing==
A system&#x27;s behavior can be mathematically modeled and is represented in the time domain as h(t) and in the frequency domain as H(s), where s is a complex number in the form of s=a+ib, or s=a+jb in electrical engineering terms (electrical engineers use &quot;j&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot; because current is represented by the variable i). Input signals are usually called x(t) or X(s) and output signals are usually called y(t) or Y(s).

===Convolution===
Convolution is the basic concept in signal processing that states an input signal can be combined with the system&#x27;s function to find the output signal. It is the integral of the product of two waveforms after one has reversed and shifted; the symbol for convolution is *. 
: formula_1
That is the convolution integral and is used to find the convolution of a signal and a system; typically a = -∞ and b = +∞.

Consider two waveforms f and g. By calculating the convolution, we determine how much a reversed function g must be shifted along the x-axis to become identical to function f. The convolution function essentially reverses and slides function g along the axis, and calculates the integral of their (f and the reversed and shifted g) product for each possible amount of sliding. When the functions match, the value of (f*g) is maximized. This occurs because when positive areas (peaks) or negative areas (troughs) are multiplied, they contribute to the integral.

===Fourier transform===
The Fourier transform is a function that transforms a signal or system in the time domain into the frequency domain, but it only works for certain functions. The constraint on which systems or signals can be transformed by the Fourier Transform is that: 
:formula_2
This is the Fourier transform integral:
:formula_3
Usually the Fourier transform integral isn&#x27;t used to determine the transform; instead, a table of transform pairs is used to find the Fourier transform of a signal or system. The inverse Fourier transform is used to go from frequency domain to time domain: 
:formula_4
Each signal or system that can be transformed has a unique Fourier transform. There is only one time signal for any frequency signal, and vice versa.

===Laplace transform===
The Laplace transform is a generalized Fourier transform. It allows a transform of any system or signal because it is a transform into the complex plane instead of just the jω line like the Fourier transform. The major difference is that the Laplace transform has a region of convergence for which the transform is valid. This implies that a signal in frequency may have more than one signal in time; the correct time signal for the transform is determined by the region of convergence. If the region of convergence includes the jω axis, jω can be substituted into the Laplace transform for s and it&#x27;s the same as the Fourier transform. The Laplace transform is:
:formula_5
and the inverse Laplace transform, if all the singularities of X(s) are in the left half of the complex plane, is:
:formula_6

===Bode plots===
Bode plots are plots of magnitude vs. frequency and phase vs. frequency for a system. The magnitude axis is in [Decibel] (dB). The phase axis is in either degrees or radians. The frequency axes are in a [logarithmic scale]. These are useful because for sinusoidal inputs, the output is the input multiplied by the value of the magnitude plot at the frequency and shifted by the value of the phase plot at the frequency.

==Domains==

===Time domain===
This is the domain that most people are familiar with. A plot in the time domain shows the amplitude of the signal with respect to time.

===Frequency domain===
A plot in the frequency domain shows either the phase shift or magnitude of a signal at each frequency that it exists at. These can be found by taking the Fourier transform of a time signal and are plotted similarly to a bode plot.

==Signals==
While any signal can be used in analog signal processing, there are many types of signals that are used very frequently.

===Sinusoids===
Sinusoids are the building block of analog signal processing. All real world signals can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoidal functions via a Fourier series. A sinusoidal function can be represented in terms of an exponential by the application of Euler&#x27;s Formula.

===Impulse===
An impulse (Dirac delta function) is defined as a signal that has an infinite magnitude and an infinitesimally narrow width with an area under it of one, centered at zero. An impulse can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoids that includes all possible frequencies. It is not, in reality, possible to generate such a signal, but it can be sufficiently approximated with a large amplitude, narrow pulse, to produce the theoretical impulse response in a network to a high degree of accuracy. The symbol for an impulse is δ(t). If an impulse is used as an input to a system, the output is known as the impulse response. The impulse response defines the system because all possible frequencies are represented in the input

===Step===
A unit step function, also called the Heaviside step function, is a signal that has a magnitude of zero before zero and a magnitude of one after zero. The symbol for a unit step is u(t). If a step is used as the input to a system, the output is called the step response. The step response shows how a system responds to a sudden input, similar to turning on a switch. The period before the output stabilizes is called the transient part of a signal. The step response can be multiplied with other signals to show how the system responds when an input is suddenly turned on.

The unit step function is related to the Dirac delta function by;

:formula_7

==Systems==

===Linear time-invariant (LTI)===
Linearity means that if you have two inputs and two corresponding outputs, if you take a linear combination of those two inputs you will get a linear combination of the outputs. An example of a linear system is a first order low-pass or high-pass filter. Linear systems are made out of analog devices that demonstrate linear properties. These devices don&#x27;t have to be entirely linear, but must have a region of operation that is linear. An operational amplifier is a non-linear device, but has a region of operation that is linear, so it can be modeled as linear within that region of operation. Time-invariance means it doesn&#x27;t matter when you start a system, the same output will result. For example, if you have a system and put an input into it today, you would get the same output if you started the system tomorrow instead. There aren&#x27;t any real systems that are LTI, but many systems can be modeled as LTI for simplicity in determining what their output will be. All systems have some dependence on things like temperature, signal level or other factors that cause them to be non-linear or non-time-invariant, but most are stable enough to model as LTI. Linearity and time-invariance are important because they are the only types of systems that can be easily solved using conventional analog signal processing methods. Once a system becomes non-linear or non-time-invariant, it becomes a non-linear differential equations problem, and there are very few of those that can actually be solved.

<doc id="405755" wikidata="Q5095799" url="?curid=405755" title="Chicago Surrealist Group">
<text>The Chicago Surrealist Group was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in July 1966 by Franklin Rosemont, Penelope Rosemont, Bernard Marszalek, Tor Faegre and Robert Green after a trip to Paris in 1965, during which they were in contact with André Breton. Its initial members came from far-left or anarchist backgrounds and had already participated in groups IWW (calling themselves the Rebel Worker Group and putting out a magazine called the &quot;Rebel Worker&quot;) and SDS; indeed, the Chicago group edited an issue of &quot;Radical America&quot;, the SDS journal, and the SDS printshop printed some of the group&#x27;s first publications.

== Collaborations and projects ==
The group played a major role in organizing the World Surrealist Exhibition held at Gallery Black Swan in Chicago in 1976. As the name suggests, broader in scope than previous &quot;international&quot; exhibitions, it featured hundreds of works almost exclusively from contemporary participants in surrealism from thirty-one countries.

&quot;Marvelous Freedom/Vigilance of Desire&quot; was the title of the catalogue of the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition. It contains a number of texts and reproductions, as well as a blueprint of the layout of the gallery, with the location of the different &quot;domains&quot; into which the exhibition was organised.

The group also produced four issues of a journal, &quot;Arsenal: Surrealist Subversion&quot;, between 1970 and 1989. Participants in the group&#x27;s activities have included Clarence John Laughlin, Gerome Kamrowski, Philip Lamantia, Tristan Meinecke and Franklin Rosemont. As participants past and present have been based in cities other than Chicago, the group has never been strictly defined by geography, despite its name. The group has worked with others, such as The Surrealist Group in Stockholm, with which it met in Chicago and Stockholm in 1986, publishing the &quot;International Surrealist Bulletin&quot; No. 1.

<text>Alan Holmes is a musician and record producer, based in north Wales.
Although he began his musical career in the late 1960s in childhood beat group the Insects, he first came to prominence in the Zuggs (in 1979), followed by A Silly Tree, the latter including Gary Stubbs, later of Cut Tunes with whom Holmes also served. Holmes was responsible for the cult psychedelic band the Pinecones and by the mid-1980s he was a key member of Reinheitsgebot, Third Spain and the Lungs.

Holmes&#x27; career came into its own as bass-player with the late-1980s Welsh language punk group Fflaps, who released two LPs for the Liverpool Probe Plus label and a third for the Central Slate label, in addition to touring Europe extensively between 1988 and 1992. After his bass amplifier blew up on stage, he moved to guitar and the group morphed into the more psychedelic/experimental Ectogram in 1993.

Holmes has worked as a session musician on several albums by Welsh artists including the debut album by Melys, and has produced several albums including the early releases of Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci. He has also been responsible for much of the sleeve art of the Ankst label.

He continues to work with his own groups Parking Non-Stop and Spectralate in addition to making solo recordings as &#x27;The Groceries&#x27;.

<doc id="405765" wikidata="Q2281810" url="?curid=405765" title="Sidereal and tropical astrology">
<text>In astrology, &quot;sidereal&quot; and &quot;tropical&quot; are terms that refer to two different systems of ecliptic coordinates used to divide the ecliptic into twelve &quot;signs&quot;. Each sign is divided into 30 degrees, making a total of 360 degrees. The terms sidereal and tropical may also refer to two different definitions of a year, applied in sidereal solar calendars or tropical solar calendars.

While sidereal systems of astrology calculate twelve zodiac signs based on the observable sky and thus account for the apparent backwards movement of fixed stars of about 1 degree every 72 years from the perspective of the Earth due to the Earth&#x27;s axial precession, tropical systems consider 0 degrees of Aries as always coinciding with the March equinox (known as the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere) and define twelve zodiac signs from this starting point, basing their definitions upon the seasons and not upon the observable sky wherein the March equinox currently falls in Pisces due to the Earth&#x27;s axial precession. These differences have caused sidereal and tropical zodiac systems, which were aligned around 2,000 years ago when the March equinox coincided with Aries in the observable sky, to drift apart over the centuries.

Sidereal astrology accounts for the Earth&#x27;s axial precession and maintains the alignment between signs and constellations via corrective systems known as ayanamsas (Sanskrit: &quot;&#x27;ayana&#x27;&quot; &quot;movement&quot; + &quot;&#x27;aṃśa&quot;&#x27; &quot;component&quot;), whereas tropical astrology, to reiterate, is based upon the seasonal cycle of the Northern hemisphere and does not take axial precession into consideration. Though tropical astrology typically considers the zodiac of the Northern Hemisphere to be applicable without change to the Southern hemisphere, a small number of tropical astrologers modify the zodiac to reflect seasons in the Southern hemisphere, taking Libra as the sign that coincides with the spring equinox instead of Aries.

Ayanamsa systems used in Hindu astrology (also known as Vedic astrology) include the Lahiri ayanamsa and the Raman ayanamsa, of which the Lahiri ayanamsa is the most widely used. The Fagan-Bradley ayanamsa is an example of an ayanamsa system used in Western sidereal astrology. As of 2020, sun signs calculated using the Sri Yukteswar ayanamsa were around 23 degrees behind tropical sun signs. Per these calculations, persons born between March 12 – April 12, for instance, would have the sun sign of Pisces. Per tropical calculations, in contrast, persons born between March 21 – April 19 would have the sun sign of Aries.

==Astronomic zodiac==
A small number of sidereal astrologers do not take the astrological signs as an equal division of the ecliptic but define their signs based on the actual width of the individual constellations. They also include constellations that are disregarded by the traditional zodiac but are still in contact with the ecliptic.

For the purpose of determining the constellations in contact with the ecliptic, the constellation boundaries as defined by the International Astronomical Union in 1930 are used. For example, the Sun enters the IAU &quot;boundary&quot; of Aries on April 19 at the lower right corner, a position that is still rather closer to the &quot;body&quot; of Pisces, as the first sign rather than of Aries. The IAU defined the constellation boundaries without consideration of astrological purposes.

The dates the Sun passes through the 12 astronomical constellations of the ecliptic are listed below, accurate to the year 2011. The dates will progress by an increment of one day every 70.5 years. The corresponding tropical and sidereal dates are given as well.

<text>A linear combination of atomic orbitals or LCAO is a quantum superposition of atomic orbitals and a technique for calculating molecular orbitals in quantum chemistry. In quantum mechanics, electron configurations of atoms are described as wavefunctions. In a mathematical sense, these wave functions are the basis set of functions, the basis functions, which describe the electrons of a given atom. In chemical reactions, orbital wavefunctions are modified, i.e. the electron cloud shape is changed, according to the type of atoms participating in the chemical bond.

It was introduced in 1929 by Sir John Lennard-Jones with the description of bonding in the diatomic molecules of the first main row of the periodic table, but had been used earlier by Linus Pauling for H2+.

== Mathematical description ==

An initial assumption is that the number of molecular orbitals is equal to the number of atomic orbitals included in the linear expansion. In a sense, &quot;n&quot; atomic orbitals combine to form &quot;n&quot; molecular orbitals, which can be numbered &quot;i&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot; and which may not all be the same. The expression (linear expansion) for the &quot;i&quot; th molecular orbital would be:

: formula_1

or

: formula_2

where formula_3 is a molecular orbital represented as the sum of &quot;n&quot; atomic orbitals formula_4, each multiplied by a corresponding coefficient formula_5, and &quot;r&quot; (numbered 1 to &quot;n&quot;) represents which atomic orbital is combined in the term. The coefficients are the weights of the contributions of the n atomic orbitals to the molecular orbital. The Hartree–Fock method is used to obtain the coefficients of the expansion.
The orbitals are thus expressed as linear combinations of basis functions, and the basis functions are single-electron functions which may or may not be centered on the nuclei of the component atoms of the molecule. In either case the basis functions are usually also referred to as atomic orbitals (even though only in the former case this name seems to be adequate). The atomic orbitals used are typically those of hydrogen-like atoms since these are known analytically i.e. Slater-type orbitals but other choices are possible such as the Gaussian functions from standard basis sets or the pseudo-atomic orbitals from plane-wave pseudopotentials.

By minimizing the total energy of the system, an appropriate set of coefficients of the linear combinations is determined. This quantitative approach is now known as the Hartree–Fock method. However, since the development of computational chemistry, the LCAO method often refers not to an actual optimization of the wave function but to a qualitative discussion which is very useful for predicting and rationalizing results obtained via more modern methods. In this case, the shape of the molecular orbitals and their respective energies are deduced approximately from comparing the energies of the atomic orbitals of the individual atoms (or molecular fragments) and applying some recipes known as level repulsion and the like. The graphs that are plotted to make this discussion clearer are called correlation diagrams. The required atomic orbital energies can come from calculations or directly from experiment via Koopmans&#x27; theorem.

This is done by using the symmetry of the molecules and orbitals involved in bonding, and thus is sometimes called &quot;symmetry adapted linear combination&quot; (SALC). The first step in this process is assigning a point group to the molecule. Each operation in the point group is performed upon the molecule. The number of bonds that are unmoved is the character of that operation. This reducible representation is decomposed into the sum of irreducible representations. These irreducible representations correspond to the symmetry of the orbitals involved. 

Molecular orbital diagrams provide simple qualitative LCAO treatment. The Hückel method, the extended Hückel method and the Pariser–Parr–Pople method, provide some quantitative theories.

<doc id="405770" wikidata="Q5331464" url="?curid=405770" title="Eavan Boland">
<text>Eavan Aisling Boland ( ; 24 September 1944 – 27 April 2020) was an Irish poet, author, and professor. She was a professor at Stanford University, where she had taught from 1996. Her work deals with the Irish national identity, and the role of women in Irish history. A number of poems from Boland&#x27;s poetry career are studied by Irish students who take the Leaving Certificate. She was a recipient of the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry.

==Early life and education==
Boland&#x27;s father, Frederick Boland, was a career diplomat and her mother, Frances Kelly, was a noted painter. She was born in Dublin in 1944.

When she was six, Boland&#x27;s father was appointed Irish Ambassador to the United Kingdom; the family followed him to London, where Boland had her first experiences of anti-Irish sentiment. Her dealing with this hostility strengthened Boland&#x27;s identification with her Irish heritage. She spoke of this time in her poem, &quot;An Irish Childhood in England: 1951&quot;.

At 14, she returned to Dublin to attend Holy Child School in Killiney. She published a pamphlet of poetry (23 Poems) in her first year at Trinity, in 1962. Boland earned a BA with First Class Honors in English Literature and Language from Trinity College Dublin in 1966.

== Career ==
=== Teaching and Professorial roles ===
After graduating, Boland held numerous teaching positions and published poetry, prose criticism and essays. She taught at Trinity College Dublin, University College, Dublin, and Bowdoin College, and was a member of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. She was also writer in residence at Trinity College Dublin, and at the National Maternity Hospital.

In 1969, Boland married the novelist Kevin Casey; they had two daughters together. Her experiences as a wife and mother influenced her to write about the centrality of the ordinary, as well as providing a frame for more political and historical themes. According to her friend Gabrielle Calvocoressi, she &quot;loved gossip like fish love water&quot;.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Boland taught at the School of Irish Studies in Dublin. From 1996 she was a tenured Professor of English at Stanford University where she was the Bella Mabury and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor in the Humanities and Melvin and Bill Lane Professor for Director of the Creative Writing program. She divided her time between Palo Alto and her home in Dublin.

=== Poetry ===
Eavan Boland&#x27;s first book of poetry was &quot;New Territory&quot; published in 1967 with Dublin publisher Allen Figgis. This was followed by &quot;The War Horse&quot; (1975), &quot;In Her Own Image&quot; (1980). &quot;Night Feed&quot; (1982), established her reputation as a writer on the ordinary lives of women and on the difficulties faced by women poets in a male-dominated literary world.

Boland was writer in residence at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, in 1994. During this time she composed &#x27;Night Feed&#x27; and &#x27;The Tree of Life&#x27;, and her work remains on a plaque in the hospital garden.

Several of her volumes of poetry have been Poetry Book Society Choices in the UK, where she is primarily published by Carcanet Press. In the United States her publisher is W. W. Norton.

Her poem &quot;Quarantine&quot; was one of 10 poems shortlisted for RTÉ&#x27;s selection of Ireland&#x27;s favourite poems of the last 100 years in 2015.

Former Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, quoted from her poem &quot;&quot;The Emigrant Irish&quot; in his address to the joint houses of the US Congress in May 2008.

On 15 March 2016, President Obama quoted lines from her poem &quot;On a Thirtieth Anniversary&quot; (from &quot;Against Love Poetry&quot; 2001) in his remarks at a reception in the White House to celebrate St Patrick&#x27;s Day.

In March 2018 RTE broadcast a documentary on her life as a poet called &quot;Eavan Boland: Is it Still the Same?&quot;&quot;. In the same year, Boland was commissioned by the Government of Ireland and the Royal Irish Academy to write the poem &quot;Our future will become the past of other women&quot; to be read at the UN and in Ireland during the centenary commemorations of women gaining the vote in Ireland in 1918.

=== Editing and translating ===
Boland co-edited &quot;The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms&quot; (with Mark Strand; W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2000). She also published a volume of translations in 2004 called &quot;After Every War&quot; (Princeton University Press). With Edward Hirsch, she co-edited &quot;The Making of a Sonnet: A Norton Anthology of the Sonnet&quot; (W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2008).

==Awards==

In 1976, Boland won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for her involvement in &quot;The Arts Programme&quot; broadcast on RTÉ Radio. Her other awards include a Lannan Foundation Award in Poetry and an American Ireland Fund Literary Award.

Her collection &quot;In a Time of Violence&quot; (1994) received a Lannan Award and was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize.

In 1997 she received an honorary degree from University College Dublin. She also received honorary degrees from Strathclyde University and Colby College in the US in 1997, and the College of the Holy Cross in 1999. She received one from Bowdoin College in 2004. In 2004 she also received an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin.

Boland received the Bucknell Medal of Distinction 2000 from Bucknell University, the Corrington Medal for Literary Excellence Centenary College 2002, the Smartt Family prize from the Yale Review and the John Frederick Nims Award from Poetry Magazine 2002.

Her volume of poems &quot;Against Love Poetry&quot; was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.

Her volume &quot;Domestic Violence&quot; (2007) was shortlisted for the Forward prize in the UK. Her poem &#x27;Violence Against Women&#x27; from the same volume was awarded the James Boatwright III Prize for Poetry for the best poem published in 2007 in &quot;Shenandoah&quot; magazine.

In 2012, Boland won a PEN Award for creative nonfiction with her collection of essays, &quot;A Journey With Two Maps: Becoming a Woman Poet&quot; published in 2012.

In 2016 she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2017 she received the Bob Hughes Lifetime Achievement Award at the Bord Gáis Energy Irish Book Awards.

On 25 May 2018 she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy. Boland received the Irish PEN Award for Literature in 2019.

== Death and legacy ==

Boland was writer in residence at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, in 1994. During this time she composed &#x27;Night Feed&#x27; and &#x27;The Tree of Life&#x27;, and her work remains on a plaque in the hospital garden.

Boland died in Dublin on 27 April 2020, aged 75.

In 2020, Boland was posthumously awarded the Costa Book Award for poetry for her final collection &quot;The Historians&quot;.

In 2024, Trinity College Dublin renamed the &quot;denamed&quot; former Berkeley Library as the Eavan Boland Library.

<text>They&#x27;d Rather Be Right (also known as The Forever Machine) is a science fiction novel by American writers Mark Clifton and Frank Riley.

==Plot==

Two professors create an advanced cybernetic brain, which they call &quot;Bossy.&quot; Bossy can &quot;optimise your mind...and give you eternal youth into the bargain, but only if you&#x27;re ready to abandon all your favourite prejudices.&quot; However, when given the choice of admitting they were wrong and therefore being able to benefit from Bossy&#x27;s abilities, most people would rather be right, and Bossy&#x27;s ability to confer immortality is almost made ineffective by humanity&#x27;s fear of &quot;her.&quot;
==Reception and significance==

&quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; somewhat controversially won the Hugo Award for best novel in 1955, the second Hugo ever presented for a novel.

In a brief 1982 review of a contemporary reprint of the novel, author David Langford wrote that &quot;though it contains an interesting idea, the book seems an implausible award-winner. It&#x27;s fine (...) to postulate a machine giving immortality, youth and a perfect complexion to those and only those who can cast aside preconceptions and prejudices (...) The idea, though, is flattened into the ground by the authors&#x27; reluctance to do the work which would make it convincing.&quot;

Langford has also addressed conspiracy theories attributing &quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot;&#x27;s win to Scientology, saying it is more likely that Clifton was popular for his short stories.

&quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale faulted the novel, saying, &quot;although a passably workmanlike job, loose ends outnumber neat knits in this yarn.&quot;

In 2008 Sam Jordison described the novel as &quot;appalling,&quot; the &quot;worst ever winner [of the Hugo Award],&quot; and &quot;a basic creative writing &#x27;how not to,&#x27;&quot; saying that its win &quot;by public vote (...) raises serious questions about the value of a universal franchise.&quot; Similarly, Lawrence Watt-Evans has noted that &quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; is &quot;the usual [book] cited&quot; as the &quot;worst book ever to win [the Hugo Award]&quot;, and Rick Cook responded to the question of &quot;Is the book any good?&quot; with &quot;No,&quot; going on to explain that it originated as &quot;one of those tailored-to-order serials for the old &quot;Astounding&quot;. Sometimes those things worked and sometimes they didn&#x27;t. This one didn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Publication history==

&quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; was first published as a four-part serial in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; from August 1954 to November 1954. It was published as a book in 1957, and a heavily cut version was released the following year under the title &quot;The Forever Machine&quot;. The novel has been reprinted a few times in the decades since, including at least two foreign language translations.

&quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Crazy Joey&quot; by Mark Clifton with Alex Apostolides
(August 1953, originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;) and &quot;Hide! Hide! Witch!&quot; by Mark Clifton with Alex Apostolides (December 1953, originally published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;).

The stories &quot;Crazy Joey&quot; and &quot;Hide! Hide! Witch!&quot; appeared without &quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; in &quot;The Science Fiction of Mark Clifton&quot;, edited by Barry N. Malzberg and Martin H. Greenberg (Southern Illinois University Press; December 8, 1980). 

In 1992, Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers confusingly re-issued &quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; with its
two prequel stories, &quot;Crazy Joey&quot; and &quot;Hide! Hide! Witch!&quot;, under the title
&quot;The Forever Machine.&quot; In this volume, the stories &quot;Crazy Joey&quot; and &quot;Hide! Hide! Witch!&quot;
comprise the first section, entitled &quot;Crazy Joey,&quot; while the novel &quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot;
makes up the second section, entitled &quot;Bossy.&quot;

<text>Slater-type orbitals (STOs) or Slater-type functions (STFs) are functions used as atomic orbitals in the linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method. They are named after the physicist John C. Slater, who introduced them in 1930.

They possess exponential decay at long range and Kato&#x27;s cusp condition at short range (when combined as hydrogen-like atom functions, i.e. the analytical solutions of the stationary Schrödinger equation for one electron atoms). Unlike the hydrogen-like (&quot;hydrogenic&quot;) Schrödinger orbitals, STOs have no radial nodes (neither do Gaussian-type orbitals).

==Definition==
STOs have the following radial part:

: formula_1
where
* is a natural number that plays the role of principal quantum number, = 1,2...,
* is a normalizing constant,
* is the distance of the electron from the atomic nucleus, and
* formula_2 is a constant related to the effective charge of the nucleus, the nuclear charge being partly shielded by electrons. Historically, the effective nuclear charge was estimated by Slater&#x27;s rules.

The normalization constant is computed from the integral
:formula_3
Hence
:formula_4

It is common to use the spherical harmonics formula_5 depending on the polar coordinates
of the position vector formula_6 as the angular part of the Slater orbital.

==Derivatives==
The first radial derivative of the radial part of a Slater-type orbital is
:formula_7
The radial Laplace operator is split in two differential operators
:formula_8
The first differential operator of the Laplace operator yields
:formula_9
The total Laplace operator yields after applying the second differential operator
:formula_10
the result
:formula_11
Angular dependent derivatives of the spherical harmonics don&#x27;t depend on the radial function and have to be evaluated separately.

==Integrals==
The fundamental mathematical properties are those associated with the kinetic energy, nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion integrals for placement of the orbital at the center of a single nucleus. Dropping the normalization factor , the representation of the orbitals below is
:formula_12

The Fourier transform is
:formula_13
where the formula_14 are defined by
:formula_15

The overlap integral is
:formula_16
of which the normalization integral is a special case. The superscript star denotes complex-conjugation.

The kinetic energy integral is
formula_17
a sum over three overlap integrals already computed above.

The Coulomb repulsion integral can be evaluated using the Fourier representation
(see above)

:formula_18

which yields
formula_19
These are either individually calculated with the law of residues or recursively as proposed by Cruz &quot;et al&quot;. (1978).

==STO software==
Some quantum chemistry software uses sets of Slater-type functions (STF) analogous to Slater type orbitals, but with variable exponents chosen to minimize the total molecular energy (rather than by Slater&#x27;s rules as above). The fact that products of two STOs on distinct atoms are more difficult to express than those of Gaussian functions (which give a displaced Gaussian) has led many to expand them in terms of Gaussians.

Analytical ab initio software for polyatomic molecules has been developed, e.g., STOP: a Slater Type Orbital Package in 1996.

SMILES uses analytical expressions when available and Gaussian expansions otherwise. It was first released in 2000.

Various grid integration schemes have been developed, sometimes after analytical work for quadrature (Scrocco), most famously in the ADF suite of DFT codes.

After the work of John Pople, Warren. J. Hehre and Robert F. Stewart, a least squares representation of the Slater atomic orbitals as a sum of Gaussian-type orbitals is used. In their 1969 paper, the fundamentals of this principle are discussed and then further improved and used in the GAUSSIAN DFT code.

<text>In computational chemistry and molecular physics, Gaussian orbitals (also known as Gaussian type orbitals, GTOs or Gaussians) are functions used as atomic orbitals in the LCAO method for the representation of electron orbitals in molecules and numerous properties that depend on these.

== Rationale ==

The use of Gaussian orbitals in electronic structure theory (instead of the more physical Slater-type orbitals) was first proposed by Boys in 1950. The principal reason for the use of Gaussian basis functions in molecular quantum chemical calculations is the &#x27;Gaussian Product Theorem&#x27;, which guarantees that the product of two GTOs centered on two different atoms is a finite sum of Gaussians centered on a point along the axis connecting them. In this manner, four-center integrals can be reduced to finite sums of two-center integrals, and in a next step to finite sums of one-center integrals. The speedup by 4-5 orders of magnitude compared to Slater orbitals outweighs the extra cost entailed by the larger number of basis functions generally required in a Gaussian calculation.

For reasons of convenience, many quantum chemistry programs work in a basis of Cartesian Gaussians even when spherical Gaussians are requested, as integral evaluation is much easier in the Cartesian basis, and the spherical functions can be simply expressed using the Cartesian functions.
== Mathematical form ==

The Gaussian basis functions obey the usual radial-angular decomposition
: formula_1,
where formula_2 is a spherical harmonic, formula_3 and formula_4 are the angular momentum and its formula_5 component, and formula_6 are spherical coordinates.

While for Slater orbitals the radial part is
: formula_7
formula_8 being a normalization constant, for Gaussian primitives the radial part is
: formula_9
where formula_10 is the normalization constant corresponding to the Gaussian.

The normalization condition which determines formula_8 or formula_10 is
:formula_13
which in general does not impose orthogonality in formula_3.

Because an individual primitive Gaussian function gives a rather poor description for the electronic wave function near the nucleus, Gaussian basis sets are almost always contracted:
:formula_15,
where formula_16 is the contraction coefficient for the primitive with exponent formula_17. The coefficients are given with respect to normalized primitives, because coefficients for unnormalized primitives would differ by many orders of magnitude. The exponents are reported in atomic units. There is a large library of published Gaussian basis sets optimized for a variety of criteria available at the Basis Set Exchange portal.

===Cartesian coordinates===

In Cartesian coordinates, Gaussian-type orbitals can be written in terms of exponential factors in the formula_18, formula_19, and formula_5 directions as well as an exponential factor formula_21 controlling the width of the orbital. The expression for a Cartesian Gaussian-type orbital, with the appropriate normalization coefficient is

:formula_22

In the above expression, formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25 must be integers. If formula_26, then the orbital has spherical symmetry and is considered an s-type GTO. If formula_27, the GTO possesses axial symmetry along one axis and is considered a p-type GTO. When formula_28, there are six possible GTOs that may be constructed; this is one more than the five canonical d orbital functions for a given angular quantum number. To address this, a linear combination of two d-type GTOs can be used to reproduce a canonical d function. Similarly, there exist 10 f-type GTOs, but only 7 canonical f orbital functions; this pattern continues for higher angular quantum numbers.

==Molecular integrals==
Taketa et al. (1966) presented the necessary mathematical equations for obtaining matrix elements in the Gaussian basis. Since then much work has been done to speed up the evaluation of these integrals which are the slowest part of many quantum chemical calculations. Živković and Maksić (1968) suggested using Hermite Gaussian functions, as this simplifies the equations. McMurchie and Davidson (1978) introduced recursion relations, which greatly reduces the amount of calculations. Pople and Hehre (1978) developed a local coordinate method. Obara and Saika introduced efficient recursion relations in 1985, which was followed by the development of other important recurrence relations. Gill and Pople (1990) introduced a &#x27;PRISM&#x27; algorithm which allowed efficient use of 20 different calculation paths.

==The POLYATOM System==
The POLYATOM System was the first package for &quot;ab initio&quot; calculations using Gaussian orbitals that was applied to a wide variety of molecules. It was developed in Slater&#x27;s Solid State and Molecular Theory Group (SSMTG) at MIT using the resources of the Cooperative Computing Laboratory. The mathematical infrastructure and operational software were developed by Imre Csizmadia, Malcolm Harrison, Jules Moskowitz and Brian Sutcliffe.

<doc id="405803" wikidata="Q373984" url="?curid=405803" title="Complementary colors">
<text>Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined or mixed, cancel each other out (lose chroma) by producing a grayscale color like white or black. When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those two colors. Complementary colors may also be called &quot;opposite colors&quot;. 

Which pairs of colors are considered complementary depends on the color model that one uses:
* Modern color theory uses either the RGB additive color model or the CMY subtractive color model, and in these, the complementary pairs are [[red]]–[[cyan]], [[green]]–[[magenta]] (one of the purples), and [[blue]]–[[yellow]].
* In the traditional RYB color model, the complementary color pairs are [[red]]–[[green]], [[yellow]]–[[purple]], and [[blue]]–[[orange (colour)|orange]].
* Opponent process theory suggests that the most contrasting color pairs are red–green and blue–yellow.
* The black–white color pair is common to all the above theories.

These contradictions stem in part from the fact that traditional color theory has been superseded by empirically-derived modern color theory, and in part from the imprecision of language. For example, blue can be the complement of both yellow and orange because a wide range of hues, from cyan to blue-violet, are called blue in English.

==In different color models==
===Traditional color model===
The traditional color wheel model dates to the 18th century and is still used by many artists today. This model designates red, yellow and blue as primary colors with the primary–secondary complementary pairs of red–green, blue-orange, and yellow–purple.

In this traditional scheme, a complementary color pair contains one primary color (yellow, blue or red) and a secondary color (green, purple or orange). The complement of any primary color can be made by combining the two other primary colors. For example, to achieve the complement of yellow (a primary color) one could combine red and blue. The result would be purple, which appears directly across from yellow on the color wheel. Continuing with the color wheel model, one could then combine yellow and purple, which essentially means that all three primary colors would be present at once. Since paints work by absorbing light, having all three primaries together produces a black or gray color (see subtractive color). In more recent painting manuals, the more precise subtractive primary colors are magenta, cyan and yellow.

Complementary colors can create some striking optical effects. The shadow of an object appears to contain some of the complementary color of the object. For example, the shadow of a red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows. If one stares at a color for about 45 seconds, and then looks at a white paper or wall, they will briefly see an afterimage of the object in its complementary color.

Placed side-by-side as tiny dots, in partitive color mixing, complementary colors appear gray.

===Colors produced by light===
The RGB color model, invented in the 19th century and fully developed in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a computer monitor or television screen. In the RGB model, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. The complementary primary–secondary combinations are red–cyan, green–magenta, and blue–yellow. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary colors, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary colors contain light with the full range of the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray.

In some other color models, such as the HSV color space, the neutral colors (white, grays, and black) lie along a central axis. Complementary colors (as defined in HSV) lie opposite each other on any horizontal cross-section. For example, in the CIE 1931 color space a color of a &quot;dominant&quot; wavelength can be mixed with an amount of the complementary wavelength to produce a neutral color (gray or white).

===Color printing===

Color printing, like painting, also uses subtractive colors, but the complementary colors are different from those used in painting. As a result, the same logic applies as to colors produced by light. Color printing uses the CMYK color model, making colors by overprinting cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. In printing the most common complementary colors are magenta–green, yellow–blue, and cyan–red. In terms of complementary/opposite colors, this model gives exactly the same result as using the RGB model. Black is added when needed to make the colors darker.

==In theory and art==
===In color theory===
The effect that colors have upon each other had been noted since antiquity. In his essay &quot;On Colors&quot;, Aristotle observed that &quot;when light falls upon another color, then, as a result of this new combination, it takes on another nuance of color&quot;. Saint Thomas Aquinas had written that purple looked different next to white than it did next to black, and that gold looked more striking against blue than it did against white; the Italian Renaissance architect and writer Leon Battista Alberti observed that there was harmony (&quot;coniugatio&quot; in Latin, and &quot;amicizia&quot; in Italian) between certain colors, such as red–green and red–blue; and Leonardo da Vinci observed that the finest harmonies were those between colors exactly opposed (&quot;retto contrario&quot;), but no one had a convincing scientific explanation why that was so until the 18th century.

In 1704, in his treatise on optics, Isaac Newton devised a circle showing a spectrum of seven colors. In this work and in an earlier work in 1672, he observed that certain colors around the circle were opposed to each other and provided the greatest contrast; he named red and blue (modern cyan), yellow and violet, and green and &quot;a purple close to scarlet&quot;.

In the following decades, scientists refined Newton&#x27;s color circle, eventually giving it twelve colors: the three primary colors (yellow, blue, and red); three secondary colors (green, purple and orange), made by combining primary colors; and six additional tertiary colors, made by combining the primary and secondary colors.

In two reports read before the Royal Society (London) in 1794, the American-born British scientist Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753–1814), coined the term &quot;complement&quot; to describe two colors that, when mixed, produce white. While conducting photometric experiments on factory lighting in Munich, Thompson noticed that an &quot;imaginary&quot; blue color was produced in the shadow of yellow candlelight illuminated by skylight, an effect that he reproduced in other colors by means of tinted glasses and pigmented surfaces. He theorized that &quot;To every color, without exception, whatever may be its hue or shade, or however it may be compounded, there is another in perfect harmony to it, which is its complement, and may be said to be its companion.&quot; He also suggested some possible practical uses of this discovery. &quot;By experiments of this kind, which might easily be made, ladies may choose ribbons for their gowns, or those who furnish rooms may arrange their colors upon principles of the most perfect harmony and of the purest taste. The advantages that painters might derive from a knowledge of these principles of the harmony of colors are too obvious to require illustration.&quot;

In the early 19th century, scientists and philosophers across Europe began studying the nature and interaction of colors. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe presented his own theory in 1810, stating that the two primary colors were those in the greatest opposition to each other, yellow and blue, representing light and darkness. He wrote that &quot;Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; blue is a darkness weakened by light.&quot; Out of the opposition of blue and yellow, through a process called &quot;steigerung&quot;, or &quot;augmentation&quot; a third color, red, was born. Goethe also proposed several sets of complementary colors which &quot;demanded&quot; each other. According to Goethe, &quot;yellow &#x27;demands&#x27; violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa&quot;. Goethe&#x27;s ideas were highly personal and often disagreed with other scientific research, but they were highly popular and influenced some important artists, including J. M. W. Turner.

At about the same time that Goethe was publishing his theory, a British physicist, doctor and Egyptologist, Thomas Young (1773–1829), showed by experiments that it was not necessary to use all the colors of spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue. This discovery was the foundation of additive colors, and of the RGB color model. He showed that it was possible to create magenta by combining red and blue light; to create yellow by mixing red and green light; and to create cyan, or blue-green, by mixing green and blue. He also found that it was possible to create virtually any other color by modifying the intensity of these colors. This discovery led to the system used today to create colors on a computer or television display. Young was also the first to propose that the retina of the eye contained nerve fibers which were sensitive to three different colors. This foreshadowed the modern understanding of color vision, in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three color receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges.

At about the same time as Young discovered additive colors, another British scientist, David Brewster (1781–1868), the inventor of the kaleidoscope, proposed a competing theory that the true primary colors were red, yellow, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red–green, blue–orange, and yellow–purple. Then a German scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz, (1821–1894), resolved the debate by showing that colors formed by light, additive colors, and those formed by pigments, subtractive colors, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary colors.

Other scientists looked more closely at the use of complementary colors. In 1828, the French chemist Eugene Chevreul, making a study of the manufacture of Gobelin tapestries to make the colors brighter, demonstrated scientifically that &quot;the arrangement of complementary colors is superior to any other harmony of contrasts&quot;. His 1839 book on the subject, &quot;De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs et de l&#x27;assortiment des objets colorés&quot;, showing how complementary colors can be used in everything from textiles to gardens, was widely read in Germany, France and England, and made complementary colors a popular concept. The use of complementary colors was further publicized by the French art critic Charles Blanc in his book &quot;Grammaire des arts et du dessin&quot; (1867) and later by the American color theorist Ogden Rood in his book &quot;Modern Chromatics&quot; (1879). These books were read with great enthusiasm by contemporary painters, particularly Georges Seurat and Vincent van Gogh, who put the theories into practice in their paintings.

In 2022 a team from Los Alamos National Laboratory found that three dimensional perceptual color space is not Riemannian, as has been widely accepted since being proposed by Riemann and furthered by Helmholtz and Schroedinger. They conducted comparative tests with human subjects using &#x27;two-alternative forced choice&#x27; tasks for greater accuracy. They found large color differences were perceived as less distant than the sum of all distances within them. When these perceived distances are plotted it results in a non-Euclidean color space. This finding most strongly impacts analogous color pairings, as the distance between colors grows larger as you zoom in on an area of color space. They conclude there would need to be changes to the color standard used by the International Commission of Weights and Measures, to account for diminishing perceptual returns on color spacings.

===In art===
In 1872, Claude Monet painted &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;, a tiny orange sun and some orange light reflected on the clouds and water in the center of a hazy blue landscape. This painting, with its striking use of the complementary colors orange and blue, gave its name to the impressionist movement. Monet was familiar with the science of complementary colors, and used them with enthusiasm. He wrote in 1888, &quot;color makes its impact from contrasts rather than from its inherent qualities...the primary colors seem more brilliant when they are in contrast with their complementary colors&quot;.

Orange and blue became an important combination for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on color theory, and they knew that orange placed next to blue made both colors much brighter. Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube. Paul Cézanne used orange made of touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background.

Vincent van Gogh was especially known for using this technique; he created his own oranges with mixtures of yellow, ochre and red, and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle-green, and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet. He also put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky. He wrote to his brother Theo of &quot;searching for oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of yellow with purple, searching for broken colors and neutral colors to harmonize the brutality of extremes, trying to make the colors intense, and not a harmony of greys&quot;.

Describing his painting, &quot;The Night Café&quot;, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: &quot;I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood-red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.&quot;

==Afterimages==

When one stares at a single color (red for example) for a sustained period of time (roughly thirty seconds to a minute), then looks at a white surface, an afterimage of the complementary color (in this case cyan) will appear. This is one of several aftereffects studied in the psychology of visual perception which are generally ascribed to fatigue in specific parts of the visual system.

In the case above the photoreceptors for red light in the retina are fatigued, lessening their ability to send the information to the brain. When white light is viewed, the red portions of light incident upon the eye are not transmitted as efficiently as the other wavelengths (or colors), and the result is the illusion of viewing the complementary color since the image is now biased by loss of the color, in this case red. As the receptors are given time to rest, the illusion vanishes. In the case of looking at the white light, red light is still incident upon the eye (as well as blue and green), however since the receptors for other light colors are also being fatigued, the eye will reach an equilibrium.

==Practical applications==
The use of complementary colors is an important aspect of aesthetically pleasing art and graphic design. This also extends to other fields such as contrasting colors in logos and retail display. When placed next to each other, complements make each other appear brighter.

Complementary colors also have more practical uses. Because orange and blue are complementary colors, life rafts and life vests are traditionally orange, to provide the highest contrast and visibility when seen from ships or aircraft over the ocean.

Red and cyan glasses are used in the anaglyph 3D system to properly visualise the stereoscopic images produced.

<text>NCAA Division II independent schools are four-year institutions that compete in college athletics at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, but do not belong to an established college athletic conference for a particular sport. These schools may however still compete as members of an athletic conference in other sports. A school may also be fully independent, and not belong to any athletic conference for any sport at all. The reason for independent status varies among institutions, but it is frequently because the school&#x27;s primary athletic conference does not sponsor a particular sport.

==Full independents==
Division II was created in 1973, at a time when the NCAA included dozens of independent members, plus members of conferences who played as independents in one or more sports. The trend toward consolidating the NCAA membership into conferences began in the late 1970s, and within a decade the number of independent programs declined dramatically. The lists below include only the small number of programs still functioning on an independent basis in recent years.

<doc id="405813" wikidata="Q5608127" url="?curid=405813" title="Grey College, Durham">
<text>Grey College is a college of Durham University in England, founded in 1959 as part of the university&#x27;s expansion of its student population. The college is named after Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time of the university&#x27;s foundation; an alternative name considered was Cromwell College, but this proved controversial and lost by a single vote in the final selection.

The student population of Grey College consists of around 1,351 students, made up of just over 1,200 undergraduate students and a further 150 postgraduate students. The college is fully catered.

==History==

Founded in 1959, Grey was the first college of the university&#x27;s post-war expansion, and the second college to open on Elvet Hill after St Mary&#x27;s. It was also the last college founded before the separation of Durham and Newcastle in 1963. The college initially only admitted men, but has been mixed since 1984.

In March 1959, just a few months before the opening of the college, the Elvet block (then the main block of the college) was devastated by fire. However, the college recovered to open as scheduled in October and adopted the phoenix as its unofficial badge. The college coat of arms features a scaling ladder (or gré — the badge of the Grey family) between two St Cuthbert&#x27;s crosses (the symbol of Durham). A new grant of arms in 2004 confirmed these and added the phoenix as a crest.

Fountains Hall was completed in 1971 and the Lattin Chapel, named after former college bursar Frank Lattin, was consecrated on 18 November 1973 by the Bishop of Durham, John Habgood.

During the 1966 World Cup, Grey College was home to the Soviet Union&#x27;s football team who were playing their group matches in Sunderland and Middlesbrough. They won all their matches while based in Durham, but eventually lost to West Germany in the semi-finals.

Grey College was exclusively for male students until the start of the 1984–1985 academic year, when a contingent of nineteen women joined the college in their first year as a pilot programme. These first female members of the college had been assigned to Grey, rather than having chosen it, since they had not specified a college of residence at the time they had applied to the University of Durham. Few changes were made to accommodate the new mixed-sex living arrangements—toilet and bathroom facilities were shared, for instance. Female students could, however, request lace curtains in addition to the regular fabric curtains for their rooms.

In the following year, 1985–1986, Grey College opened its doors to all women, who could now actively apply to join the college. By the time these women had graduated three years later, Grey had become indistinguishable in population from the other mixed-sex colleges of the university.

In 1992 a plan to construct a fourth accommodation block was announced. This became Holgate House, named after the college&#x27;s first Master, Sidney Holgate, and was opened in 1996. The Victor Watts Memorial Library, named after the college&#x27;s third master, opened as an extension to Holgate House in 2005.

==Buildings==

There are four accommodation blocks on site: Hollingside (the main building), Elvet, Oswald, and Holgate House. The college offers a number of other facilities: Hollingside contains the 280-seat dining room, the college bar, and the Junior Common Room (JCR), which has the largest TV of any Durham college. Holgate House has a conference centre and a library with over 7,000 books. A fifth building, Fountains Hall, is the home of Phoenix Theatre Company (PTC), the college chapel, a multi-purpose hall (for everything from badminton to band practice), and a toastie bar.

The Durham University Botanic Garden and the High Wood are located next door to the college, and a path leads directly to the Mountjoy Site (formerly known as the Science Site).

The original buildings from 1957–63 were included in the local list as non-designated heritage assets in November 2023. The part of the college site on the north side of Hollingside Lane is included in Durham County Council&#x27;s proposed Hill Colleges Conservation Area.

==College life==
Notable social events include &quot;The Informal or Winter Ball&quot;; the &quot;President&#x27;s Guest Night&quot; and &quot;Grey Day&quot;, a music festival following the end of the examination period. The year comes to an end with &quot;The Phoenix Ball&quot;, the largest and most lavish social event of the year.

Grey has a large number of sports clubs, ranging from Grey College Boat Club through Grey College Ultimate Frisbee Club to team croquet. Many of Grey&#x27;s sporting clubs have enjoyed success in recent years, notably the women&#x27;s hockey team, boat club, darts team, rugby team, football team, cheerleading squad and Ultimate Frisbee Club.

Members of the college sometimes refer to themselves as the &quot;Grey Army&quot; and can be found at many college sporting events (usually rugby games) supporting the team, with a &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; appointed by the JCR each academic year to lead the troops. Another mascot of the college is the &quot;College Trout&quot;—a Big Mouth Billy Hamill toy that is currently stationed behind the bar. A bi-annual magazine, &quot;Grey Matter&quot;, also exists to satirise college events.

The college has a fellowship in mathematics (the Alan David Richards Fellowship) and a general fellowship scheme (the Sidney Holgate Fellowships), which includes funding for research fellows and an artist in residence.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to spirituality:

[[Spirituality]] may refer to an ultimate or an alleged immaterial reality, an inner path enabling a person to discover the essence of their own being, or the &quot;deepest values and meanings by which people live.&quot;

Spiritual practices, including meditation, prayer and contemplation, are intended to develop an individual&#x27;s inner life; spiritual experience includes that of connectedness with a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive self; with other individuals or the human community; with nature or the cosmos; or with the divine realm.

<text>Robert Wyatt (born Robert Wyatt-Ellidge, 28 January 1945) is an English retired musician. A founding member of the influential Canterbury scene bands Soft Machine and Matching Mole, he was initially a kit drummer and singer before becoming paraplegic following an accidental fall from a window in 1973, which led him to abandon band work, explore other instruments, and begin a 40-year solo career.

A key player during the formative years of British jazz fusion, psychedelia and progressive rock, Wyatt&#x27;s own work became increasingly interpretative, collaborative and politicised from the mid-1970s onwards. His solo music has covered a particularly individual musical terrain ranging from covers of pop singles to shifting, amorphous song collections drawing on elements of jazz, folk and nursery rhyme.

Wyatt retired from his music career in 2014, stating &quot;there is a pride in [stopping], I don&#x27;t want [the music] to go off.&quot; He is married to English painter and songwriter Alfreda Benge.

==Early life==
Wyatt was born in Bristol. His mother, Honor Wyatt, was a journalist with the BBC, and his father, George Ellidge, was an industrial psychologist. Honor Wyatt was a cousin of Woodrow Wyatt, whose political stance influenced Robert in joining the Communist Party of Great Britain. Wyatt had two half-brothers from his parents&#x27; previous marriages, Honor Wyatt&#x27;s son, actor Julian Glover, and George Ellidge&#x27;s son, press photographer Mark Ellidge. His parents&#x27; friends were &quot;quite bohemian&quot;, and his upbringing was &quot;unconventional&quot;. Wyatt said &quot;It seemed perfectly normal to me. My father didn&#x27;t join us until I was six, and he died ten years later, having retired early with multiple sclerosis, so I was brought up a lot by women.&quot; Wyatt attended the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, Canterbury, and as a teenager lived with his parents in Lydden near Dover, where he was taught drums by visiting American jazz drummer George Neidorf. It was during this period that Wyatt met and became friends with expatriate Australian musician Daevid Allen, who rented a room in Wyatt&#x27;s family home.

In 1962, Wyatt and Neidorf moved to Majorca, living near the poet Robert Graves. The following year, Wyatt returned to England and joined the Daevid Allen Trio with Allen and Hugh Hopper. Allen subsequently left for France, and Wyatt and Hopper formed the Wilde Flowers, with Kevin Ayers, Richard Sinclair and Brian Hopper. Wyatt was initially the drummer in the Wilde Flowers, but following the departure of Ayers, he also became lead singer.

==Soft Machine and Matching Mole==

In 1966, the Wilde Flowers split into two bands—Caravan and the Soft Machine—and Wyatt, along with Mike Ratledge, was invited to join Soft Machine by Kevin Ayers and Daevid Allen. Wyatt both drummed and shared vocals with Ayers, an unusual combination for a stage rock band. In 1970, after chaotic touring, three albums and increasing internal conflicts in Soft Machine, Wyatt released his first solo album, &quot;The End of an Ear&quot;, which combined his vocal and multi-instrumental talents with tape effects. A year later, after becoming increasingly unhappy about his musical ideas being rejected by the others, Wyatt left Soft Machine. He participated in the fusion bigband Centipede, performed at the JazzFest Berlin&#x27;s New Violin Summit, a live concert with violinists Jean-Luc Ponty, Don &quot;Sugarcane&quot; Harris, Michał Urbaniak and Nipso Brantner, guitarist Terje Rypdal, keyboardist Wolfgang Dauner and bassist Neville Whitehead, and formed his own band Matching Mole (a pun, &quot;machine molle&quot; being French for &#x27;Soft Machine&#x27;), a largely instrumental outfit that recorded two albums.

===Accident===
Matching Mole gradually disbanded, and Wyatt began writing material that would eventually appear on his second &#x27;solo&#x27; album in Venice. He began to assemble a new band in England to record these numbers, but on 1 June 1973, during a birthday party for Gong&#x27;s Gilli Smyth and June Campbell Cramer (also known as Lady June) at the latter&#x27;s Maida Vale home, an inebriated Wyatt fell from a fourth-floor window and broke his spine. He was paralysed from the waist down and has used a wheelchair for mobility ever since. On 4 November, Pink Floyd performed two benefit concerts, in one day, at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre, supported by Soft Machine, and compered by John Peel. The concerts raised a reported £10,000 for Wyatt.

In a BBC Radio 4 profile aired in 2012, Wyatt revealed that he and his wife Alfreda Benge were also given generous help by friends of Benge&#x27;s, including supermodel Jean Shrimpton, who gave them a car, and actress Julie Christie, who gave them use of a flat in London, which they later bought from her. In the same interview, Wyatt also observed that his accident probably saved his life – although he did not drink at all when he was younger, he quickly fell into a pattern of heavy drinking while touring the United States in the late 1960s supporting the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and that he often caroused with heavy-drinking colleagues like Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding and especially Keith Moon (who introduced him to the practice of alternating shots of tequila and Southern Comfort). By his own estimation, he was an alcoholic by the early 1970s, and he felt that, had the accident not intervened to change his lifestyle, his heavy drinking and reckless behaviour would have eventually killed him.

==Solo career==
The injury led Wyatt to abandon the Matching Mole project, and his rock drumming (though he would continue to play drums and percussion in more of a &quot;jazz&quot; fashion, without the use of his feet). He promptly embarked on a solo career, and with musician friends (including Mike Oldfield, Ivor Cutler and Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith) released his solo album &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; on 26 July 1974. The album had been largely composed prior to Wyatt&#x27;s accident, but during Wyatt&#x27;s convalescence, he rethought the arrangements to adjust to his new circumstances, and many of the lyrics were completed during this period. The album was met with mostly positive reviews.

Two months later Wyatt put out a single, a cover version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, which hit number 29 in the UK chart. Both were produced by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. There were strong arguments with the producer of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; surrounding Wyatt&#x27;s performance of &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, on the grounds that his use of a wheelchair &quot;was not suitable for family viewing&quot;, the producer wanting Wyatt to appear in a wicker chair. Wyatt won the day and &quot;lost his rag but not the wheelchair&quot;. A contemporary issue of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; featured the band (a stand-in acting for Mason), all in wheelchairs, on its cover. Wyatt subsequently sang lead vocals on Mason&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Fictitious Sports&quot; (1981), a suite of songs composed by American jazz musician Carla Bley.

His follow-up single, a reggae ballad remake of Chris Andrews&#x27;s hit &quot;Yesterday Man&quot;, again produced by Mason, was eventually given a low-key release, &quot;the boss at Virgin claiming that single was &#x27;lugubrious&#x27;, the delay and lack of promotion denting Wyatt&#x27;s chances of a follow-up hit.&quot;

Wyatt&#x27;s next solo album, &quot;Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard&quot; (1975), produced by Wyatt apart from one track produced by Mason, was more jazz-led, with free jazz influences. Guest musicians included Brian Eno on guitar, synthesizer and &quot;direct inject anti-jazz ray gun&quot;. Wyatt went on to appear on the fifth release of Eno&#x27;s Obscure Records label, &quot;Jan Steele/John Cage: Voices and Instruments&quot; (1976), singing two Cage songs.

Throughout the rest of the 1970s Wyatt guested with various acts, including Henry Cow (documented on their &quot;Concerts&quot; album), Hatfield and the North, Carla Bley, Eno, Michael Mantler, and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera, contributing lead vocals to lead track &quot;Frontera&quot;, from Manzanera&#x27;s 1975 solo debut &quot;Diamond Head&quot;. In 1976 he was featured vocalist on Mantler&#x27;s settings of the poems of Edward Gorey, appearing alongside Terje Rypdal (guitar) Carla Bley (piano, clavinet, synthesizer), Steve Swallow (bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums) on the album &quot;The Hapless Child and Other Stories&quot;.

His solo work during the early 1980s was increasingly politicised, and Wyatt became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1983, his original version of Elvis Costello and Clive Langer&#x27;s Falklands War-inspired song &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;, which followed a series of political cover-versions (collected as &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot;), reached number 35 in the UK Singles Chart, having reached number 2 in John Peel&#x27;s Festive Fifty for 1982-released tracks. In 1984 Wyatt provided guest vocals, along with Tracey Thorn and Claudia Figueroa, on &quot;Venceremos (We Will Win)&quot;, a song expressing political solidarity with Chilean people suffering under Pinochet&#x27;s military dictatorship, released as a single by UK soul-jazz dance band Working Week, also included on their debut album released the following year.

In 1985 Wyatt released &quot;Old Rottenhat&quot;, his first album of original songs since &quot;Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard&quot;. The album featured strongly political songs with relatively sparse arrangements played largely by Wyatt alone.

In the late 1980s, after collaborations with other acts such as News from Babel, Scritti Politti, and Japanese recording artist Ryuichi Sakamoto on his 1989 cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;We Love You&quot; which had additional backing vocals from Brian Wilson, he and his wife Alfreda Benge spent a sabbatical in Spain, before returning in 1991 with a comeback album &quot;Dondestan&quot;. His 1997 album &quot;Shleep&quot; was also praised.

In 1999 he collaborated with the Italian singer Cristina Donà on her second album &quot;Nido&quot;. In the summer of 2000 her first EP &quot;Goccia&quot; was released and Wyatt made an appearance in the video of the title track.

Wyatt contributed &quot;Masters of the Field&quot;, as well as &quot;The Highest Gander&quot;, &quot;La Forêt Rouge&quot; and &quot;Hors Champ&quot; to the soundtrack of the 2001 film &quot;Winged Migration&quot;. He can be seen in the DVD&#x27;s Special Features section, and is praised by the film&#x27;s composer Bruno Coulais as being a big influence in his younger days.

In June 2001, Wyatt was curator of the Meltdown festival, and sang &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; with David Gilmour at the festival. It was recorded on Gilmour&#x27;s DVD &quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot;.

In January 2003, BBC Four broadcast &quot;Free Will and Testament&quot;, a programme featuring performance footage of Wyatt with musicians Ian Maidman, Liam Genockey, Annie Whitehead and Janette Mason, and interviews with John Peel, Brian Eno, Annie Whitehead, Alfie and Wyatt himself. Later in 2003, the Mercury Music Prize nominated album &quot;Cuckooland&quot; was released.

In 2004 Wyatt collaborated with Björk on the song &quot;Submarine&quot; which was released on her fifth album &quot;Medúlla&quot;. He sang and played cornet and percussion with David Gilmour on Gilmour&#x27;s album &quot;On an Island&quot;, and read passages from the novels of Haruki Murakami for Max Richter&#x27;s album &quot;Songs from Before&quot;. In 2006 Wyatt collaborated with Steve Nieve and Muriel Teodori on the opera &quot;Welcome to the Voice&quot; interpreting the character &#x27;the Friend&#x27;, both singing and playing pocket trumpet.

Wyatt released &quot;Comicopera&quot; in October 2007 on Domino Records, who went on to re-release &quot;Drury Lane&quot;, &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, &quot;Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard&quot;, &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot;, &quot;Old Rottenhat&quot;, &quot;Dondestan&quot;, &quot;Shleep&quot;, &quot;EPs&quot; and &quot;Cuckooland&quot; on CD and vinyl the following year. In 2009 he appeared on the album &quot;Around Robert Wyatt&quot; by the French Orchestre National de Jazz.

In 2008, Wyatt collaborated with Hot Chip on the EP &quot;Hot Chip with Robert Wyatt and Geese&quot;.

Wyatt was one of the guest editors of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, working on the 1 January 2010 programme. Among other things he advocated greater prominence for amateur choirs, and admitted to a preference for them over professional choirs &quot;because there&#x27;s a greater sense of commitment and meaning in their singing.&quot;

October 2014 saw the release of &quot;Different Every Time: The Authorised Biography of Robert Wyatt&quot; by Marcus O&#x27;Dair. In promotion of the book Wyatt appeared at &quot;the Wire&quot; &quot;Off the Page&quot; festival in Bristol on 26 September, and at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 23 November. A companion compilation album, &quot;Different Every Time – Ex Machina / Benign Dictatorships&quot; was released on 18 November 2014.

Wyatt performed the soundtrack to Jimmy McGovern&#x27;s 2014 BBC production, &quot;Common&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine in December 2014, Wyatt announced that he had &quot;stopped&quot; making music. He cited age and greater interest in politics as his reasons.

In January 2015 Wyatt&#x27;s biography &quot;Different Every Time&quot; was featured as BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot;, abridged by Katrin Williams and read by Julian Rhind-Tutt.

On 16 December 2016 Wyatt appeared at the Brighton Dome, with Paul Weller and Danny Thompson, in support of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, as the opening instalment of &quot;People Powered: Concerts for Corbyn&quot;. It was Wyatt&#x27;s most recent public appearance.

==Influence on other artists==
The Tears for Fears song &quot;I Believe&quot; from their 1985 album &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; was originally written by bandmember Roland Orzabal for Wyatt, and is dedicated to him. As a further tribute to Wyatt, on the B-side of the single, Orzabal performs a cover version of &quot;Sea Song&quot;, from the &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; album. This recording later appeared on the compilation album &quot;Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic&quot; and the remastered versions of &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;.

&quot;Sea Song&quot; was also covered by Rachel Unthank and the Winterset on their 2007 album &quot;The Bairns&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s David Peschek said of the cover: &quot;That&#x27;s the best version of that I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. In November 2011, The Unthanks released a live album, &quot;The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony &amp; the Johnsons&quot;, and Wyatt is quoted on the cover of the album as saying &quot;I love the idea. It makes me happy just thinking about it.&quot;

Dev Hynes credited Wyatt&#x27;s album, &quot;Old Rottenhat&quot; as an influence on the song, &quot;Take Your Time&quot; from Hynes&#x27; 2018 album (as Blood Orange), &quot;Negro Swan&quot;.

===&quot;Wyatting&quot;===

The verb &quot;Wyatting&quot; appeared in some blogs and music magazines to describe the practice of playing unusual tracks, in particular songs from Wyatt&#x27;s album &quot;Dondestan&quot;, on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers. Wyatt was quoted in 2006 in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s really funny&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m very honoured at the idea of becoming a verb.&quot; When asked if he would ever try it himself, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really like disconcerting people, but even when I try to be normal I disconcert anyway.&quot; However, Alfreda Benge said it made her angry &quot;that Robert should be used as a means of clever dicks asserting their superiority in pubs ... It&#x27;s so unlike Robert, because he&#x27;s so appreciative of the strengths of pop music. So that, I think, is a real unfairness. The man who coined it, I should like to punch him in the nose.&quot;

==Personal life==
Wyatt is married to English painter and songwriter Alfreda Benge.

<text>Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke ( 165622 January 1733), styled The Honourable Thomas Herbert until 1683, was a British statesman who served as Lord Privy Seal from 1692 to 1699.

==Background==
Herbert was the third son of Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke and his wife Catharine Villiers, daughter of Sir William Villiers, 1st Baronet who was the half-brother of the 1st Duke of Buckingham, George Villiers. Through his grandmother, Susan de Vere, he was a great-grandson of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the Oxfordians&#x27; William Shakespeare. He was educated at Tonbridge School, Kent. Both of his brothers (the 6th Earl and the 7th Earl) having died without a male heir, he succeeded to the earldoms in 1683. Through them, he would inherit the family seat of the Earls of Pembroke, Wilton House in Wiltshire.
==Public life==
Herbert was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Wilton at the two general elections of 1679 and the general election of 1681. He was no longer able to sit in the House of Commons after assuming the peerage in 1683. 

As Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire, Pembroke commanded the Wiltshire Militia against the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. They mustered at Salisbury on 17 June and marched to Bath. Hearing that Frome had declared for the Duke of Monmouth, Pembroke marched out with a squadron of Militia Horse carrying some musketeers behind their saddles. On arrival he found a large number of rebel recruits, some armed with pistols or pikes, others with scythes and clubs. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Pembroke entered the town at the head of his musketeers, followed by the horse. A shot was fired at him, but the rebels soon broke and ran before the advancing militia, who then captured the bridge after some fighting. Afterwards Pembroke with his Wiltshire Militia and some Hampshire Militia blocked Monmouth&#x27;s advance into Wiltshire. The Wiltshire Militia then accompanied the Royal army to Bridgwater in pursuit of the rebels. When Monmouth attempted a night attack on the Royal army camped on Sedgemoor, Pembroke quickly rode from his quarters at Weston Court in Westonzoyland and roused his men; they formed the reserve during the Battle of Sedgemoor. Afterwards they took part in the pursuit and clearing-up operations. 

From 1690 to 1692 as Lord Pembroke, he was First Lord of the Admiralty. He then served as Lord Privy Seal until 1699, being in 1697 the first plenipotentiary of Great Britain at the congress of Ryswick. On two occasions he was Lord High Admiral for a short period; he was also Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, while he acted as one of the Lords Justices seven times; and he was President of the Royal Society in 1689–1690. He is the dedicatee of John Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and Thomas Greenhill&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Embalming&quot;.

==Marriages and progeny==
He married three times:
*Firstly in 1684 to Margaret Sawyer, only daughter of Sir Robert Sawyer of Highclere Castle by his wife Margaret Suckeley, by whom he had seven sons and five daughters:

<doc id="405827" wikidata="Q1613706" url="?curid=405827" title="Herne the Hunter">
<text>In English folklore, Herne the Hunter is a ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park in the English county of Berkshire. He is said to have antlers growing from his head, ride a horse, torment cattle, and rattle chains. The earliest mention of Herne comes from William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1597 play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, and it is impossible to know how accurately or to what degree Shakespeare may have incorporated a real local legend into his work, though there have been several later attempts to connect Herne to historical figures, pagan deities, or ancient archetypes.

==Legend==
The earliest written account of Herne comes from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (believed to have been written around 1597). Officially published versions of the play refer only to the tale of Herne as the ghost of a former Windsor Forest keeper who haunts a particular oak tree at midnight in the winter time; he is said to have horns, shake chains and cause cattle to produce blood instead of milk:

An early, pirated version of the play from 1602 includes a different version of this text, which states that the ghost (spelled &quot;Horne&quot; in this version) was invented to scare children into obedience, and that mothers tell their children the tale of a ghost who walks the forest in the form of a great stag. Because it is a common surname, it is not possible to further identify Shakespeare&#x27;s Herne, and no earlier references to his legend exist.

Nearly two hundred years later, in 1792, Samuel Ireland slightly expanded on Shakespeare as follows:
There is little written evidence for Herne the Hunter before the 1840s, and the details of his original folk tale have been filtered through the various versions of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.

It has been noted that the reference to Herne&#x27;s death as a suicide fits a traditional belief that this sort of death is more likely to produce a haunting. Shakespeare&#x27;s reference to rattling chains also fits a very common ghostly motif. However, other elements of the tale are unusual for other ghost stories of Shakespeare&#x27;s era. Ghostly cattle or dogs were common, but there are few contemporary examples of a ghostly stag. It is possible that Shakespeare invented this detail to better fit the forest setting, or to lead into the humorous image of a character wearing antlers, which would have resembled cuckold&#x27;s horns to an Elizabethan audience. It was also unusual for ghosts of this period to produce such damaging effects. Herne is described bewitching (&quot;taking&quot;) cattle, bloodying their milk, and causing trees to wither.

===Herne&#x27;s Oak===

Herne became widely popularised after his appearance in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, and the supposed location of Herne&#x27;s Oak was, for many years, a matter of local speculation and controversy. Some Ordnance Survey maps show Herne&#x27;s Oak a little to the north of Frogmore House in the Home Park (adjoining Windsor Great Park). This tree was felled in 1796. In 1838, Edward Jesse claimed that a different tree in the avenue was the real Herne&#x27;s Oak, and this gained in popularity especially with Queen Victoria. This tree was blown down on 31 August 1863, and Queen Victoria had another tree planted on the same site. The Queen&#x27;s tree was removed in 1906 when the avenue was replanted.

One of the new oaks planted in 1906 is currently given the title of Herne&#x27;s Oak.

===Later additions===
Further details have entered the folklore from even later sources and reported sightings, such as those in the 1920s. William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s 1843 novel &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; featured Herne and popularised his legend. Ainsworth&#x27;s version of the tale added a number of new details, including having Herne being gored by a stag, only to have the Devil save him on the condition that he wear the stag&#x27;s antlers. Jacob Grimm was the first to suggest, very influentially, that Herne had once been thought of as the leader of the Wild Hunt, based on his title.

In the 20th century, further details were added to Herne&#x27;s legend, including the idea that his ghost appears shortly before national disasters and the deaths of kings. It was also during the 20th century that incidents of personal encounters with the ghost, or of people hearing his hounds and horn in Windsor Forest, were first reported.

==Possible origins==
Various theories have been proposed to account for the origin of the character, none of which has been proved conclusive, and the source for many of the tales told of Herne remains unknown.

===Palaeolithic origins and relationship with the Celtic Cernunnos===
In his 1929 book &quot;The History of the Devil – The Horned God of the West&quot; R. Lowe Thompson suggests that &quot;Herne&quot; as well as other Wild Huntsmen in European folklore all derive from the same ancient source, citing that &quot;Herne&quot; may be a cognate of the name of Gaulish deity Cernunnos in the same way that the English &quot;horn&quot; is a cognate of the Latin &quot;cornu&quot; (see Grimm&#x27;s Law for more details on this linguistic feature) explaining that &quot;As the Latin cornu changes into horn so might Cerne change into Herne.&quot; He adds, &quot;In any case the reader may also be prepared to recognize Cernunnos and the older magician, who emerge as the Wild Huntsman. My assumption is that these two forms have been derived from the same Paleolithic ancestor and can, indeed, be regarded as two aspects of one central figure, will help us to understand the identification of Herlechin and Herne, whom I will take as the most familiar example of the huntsman.&quot; Margaret Murray also identified Cernunnos with Herne in her 1933 book &quot;The God of the Witches&quot;. Some modern Neopagans such as Wiccans accept Lowe Thompson&#x27;s equation of Herne with Cernunnos (which they further connect to the Greco-Roman god Pan). Herne however is a localised figure, not found outside Berkshire and the regions of the surrounding counties into which Windsor Forest once spread, and clear evidence for the worship of Cernunnos has been recovered only on the European mainland, and not in Britain. &quot;Herne&quot; could be derived ultimately from the same Indo-European root *ker-n-, meaning bone or horn, from which &quot;Cernunnos&quot; derives. However, a more direct source may be the Old English &quot;hyrne&quot;, meaning &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;corner&quot;, which is inconsistent with the Cernunnos theory.

===Anglo-Saxon deity===
In the Early Middle Ages, Windsor Forest came under the control of the pagan Angles who worshipped their own pantheon of gods, including Woden, whose Norse equivalent Odin rode across the night sky with his own Wild Hunt and hanged himself on the world tree Yggdrasil to learn the secret of the runic alphabet. It has been suggested that the name &quot;Herne&quot; is derived from the title &quot;Herian&quot;, a title used for Woden in his role as leader of fallen warriors ().

===Historical individual===
Samuel Ireland identified Herne as a real historical individual, saying that he died an unholy death of the type that might have given rise to tales of hauntings by his unquiet spirit. The fact that Herne is apparently a purely local figure supports this theory. One possibility is that Herne is supposed to be the ghost of Richard Horne, a yeoman during the reign of Henry VIII who was caught poaching in the wood. This suggestion was first made by James Halliwell-Phillipps, who identified a document listing Horne as a &quot;hunter&quot; who had confessed to poaching. The earliest edition of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; spells the name &quot;Horne&quot;.

==Post-Shakespearean adaptations==

===Music===
*François-André Danican Philidor&#x27;s lost opera, &quot;Herne le chasseur&quot; (1773), is an adaptation of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; giving Herne the title role.

*Lord Herne is the true name of the Horned King (also referred to as the Horned Man, the Hunter of Dark, and the Master of Winter) in Jane Yolen&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;The Wild Hunt&quot;. He represents &quot;...the dark, the night, the cold. He is chaos and anger and war.&quot;

===Other references===
* Herne was incorporated into the Robin Hood legend in the 1984 television series, &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;. In it, Robin of Loxley is called by Herne to take on the mantle of &quot;the Hooded Man&quot;, which Robin&#x27;s father had predicted. It is Herne who encourages Loxley to become &#x27;Robin in the Hood&#x27; and to use his band of outlaws to fight for good against the evil Norman oppressors. Herne&#x27;s appearance bears a very strong resemblance to the illustrations that previously depicted him, in that an otherwise unnamed shaman character, portrayed by actor John Abineri, dons a stag&#x27;s head and tells Robin that &quot;when the horned one possesses [him]&quot;, he becomes the spirit of the forest. Herne featured in 17 of the 26 episodes of the series and was shown to have various magical abilities. The series&#x27; adaptation of the Robin Hood mythos has become extremely influential and many of its brand-new elements have since been reinterpreted in a manner of different ways in nearly all of the subsequent films and television series of the legend.

<text>John Clarke Slater (December 22, 1900 – July 25, 1976) was an American physicist who advanced the theory of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and solids. He also made major contributions to microwave electronics. He received a B.S. in physics from the University of Rochester in 1920 and a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard in 1923, then did post-doctoral work at the universities of Cambridge (briefly) and Copenhagen. On his return to the U.S. he joined the physics department at Harvard.

In 1930, Karl Compton, the president of MIT, appointed Slater as chairman of MIT&#x27;s department of physics. He recast the undergraduate physics curriculum, wrote 14 books between 1933 and 1968, and built a department of international prestige. During World War II, his work on microwave transmission, done partly at the Bell Laboratories and in association with the MIT Radiation Laboratory, was significant in the development of radar.

In 1950, Slater founded the Solid State and Molecular Theory Group (SSMTG) within the physics department. The following year, he resigned the chairmanship of the department and spent a year at the Brookhaven National Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission. He was appointed Institute Professor of Physics and continued to direct work in the SSMTG until he retired from MIT in 1965, at the mandatory retirement age of 65.

He then joined the Quantum Theory Project of the University of Florida as research professor, where the retirement age allowed him to work for another five years. The SSMTG has been regarded as the precursor of the MIT Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE). His scientific autobiography and three interviews present his views on research, education and the role of science in society.

Slater was nominated for the Nobel Prize, in both physics and chemistry, multiple times, and he received the National Medal of Science in 1970. In 1964, Slater and his then-92-year-old father, who had headed the Department of English at the University of Rochester many years earlier, were awarded honorary degrees by that university. Slater&#x27;s name is part of the terms Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory, Slater determinant and Slater orbital.

==Early life and education==
Slater&#x27;s father, John Rothwell Slater, was born in Virginia and had been an undergraduate at Harvard, and had become head of the English Department at the University of Rochester, which would also be Slater&#x27;s undergraduate alma mater. Slater&#x27;s youthful interests were with things mechanical, chemical, and electrical. When Slater entered the University of Rochester in 1917 he took physics courses and as a senior assisted in the physics laboratory and did his first independent research for a special honors thesis, a measurement of the dependence on pressure of the intensities of the Balmer lines of hydrogen.

He was accepted into Harvard graduate school, with the choice of a fellowship or assistantship. He chose the assistantship, during which he worked for Percy W. Bridgman. He followed Bridgman&#x27;s courses in fundamental physics and was introduced into the then-new quantum physics with the courses of E. C. Kemble. He completed the work for the Ph.D. in three years by publishing his (1924) paper &quot;Compressibility of the Alkali Halides&quot;, which embodied the thesis work he had done under Bridgman. His heart was in theory, and his first publication was not his doctor&#x27;s thesis, but a note (1924) to Nature on &quot;Radiation and Atoms.&quot;

After receiving his Ph.D., Slater held a Hamard Sheldon Fellowship for study in Europe. He spent a period in Cambridge, England, before going to Copenhagen. He did not have a happy time working with Bohr who he found domineering and regretted that his name was attached to the ill-fated Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory. Slater already had the idea that it was the photon that carried radiation energy. As he relates:
On the plus side, Slater&#x27;s name was now well known by association with Bohr. On returning to America, Slater joined the Harvard Physics Department.

== Professional career ==

===Chairing the Department of Physics at MIT===
When he became president of MIT, Karl Compton &quot;courted&quot; Slater to chair the physics department. &quot;Administration (of the Department) took up a good deal of time, more time than he (Slater) would have preferred. John was a good chairman.&quot; The following items from the successive issues of the annual MIT &quot;President&#x27;s Report&quot; trace the growth and visibility of the Department under Slater&#x27;s leadership, before World War II, and the ability of the department to contribute to defense during the war. The first two quotations are from chapters written by Compton in the successive reports. The other quotations come from the sections about the department, that Slater wrote. These include statements affecting policies in physics education and research at large, and show his deep commitment to both.
* 1930: &quot;The selection of Dr. John C. Slater as head of the (Physics) Department will strengthen ... undergraduate and graduate work ... the limitation of space has retarded the development of graduate work ... the total number of undergraduates being 53 and ... graduate students 16.&quot; (p. 21)
* 1931: &quot;This has been the first year of the Department in charge of its new Head, Professor John C. Slater ... the subjects actively (researched include) Spectroscopy, Applied Optics, Discharge of Electricity in Gases, Magneto-Optical Phenomena, Studies of Dielectrics, and various aspects of modern and classical theoretical physics.&quot; (p. 42)
* 1932: In the list of papers published by MIT faculty, items 293 to 340 are listed under Department of Physics. (p. 206-208)
* 1933: &quot;The George Eastman Research Laboratory, into which the Department moved at the beginning of the year, provides for the first time a suitable home for research in Physics at the Institute&quot;. Slater states that outside recognition is shown by holders of six National, an International, and a Rockefeller Research Fellowship choosing to come to the department. Slater describes the dedication of the Laboratory, the hosting of meetings of the International Astronomical Union, the American Physical Society, and a Spectroscopic conference, and ends: &quot;In general the year has been one of settling down to work under satisfactory conditions, after the more difficult transition of the preceding year.&quot; (p. 96-98)
* 1934: &quot;A number of advances in undergraduate teaching have been made or planned.&quot; Among the &quot;most conspicuous events&quot; in the department, &quot;we acted as host&quot; to meetings of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and a national Spectroscopic Conference, where &quot;the main topic was relation to biology and related fields.&quot; Advances in research have been &quot;taking advantage of the unusual facilities&quot; in the department, and include the work of Warren on structure of liquids, Mueller on dielectric properties, Stockbarger on crystal physics, Harrison on automating spectroscopic measurement, Wulff on hyperfine structure, Boyce on spectra of nebulae, Van der Graaff on high voltage and nuclear research, and Stratton and Morse on ellipsoidal wave functions. (p. 104-106)
* 1935: Considerable attention is given to major improvements in undergraduate teaching. The extensive comments on research mention the arrival of Robley Evans and his work on a field new to the department—radioactivity, with special attention to nuclear medicine. (p. 102-103)
* 1936: &quot;The most important development of the year in the Department has been the growing recognition of the significance of applied physics. There has been a tendency in the past among physicists to take interest only in the direct line of development of their science, and to neglect its applications.&quot; Slater develops this theme at length, and describes actions within the undergraduate, graduate and faculty work of the department and at the national level to develop Applied Physics. The description of the flourishing basic research refers to ten different areas, including the upsurge in work on radioactivity. (p. 131-134).
* 1937 to 1941: These continue in the same vein. But world affairs begin to impact. The 1941 report ends: &quot;The X-ray branch had as a guest Professor Rose C. L. Mooney of Newcomb College, who was prevented by the war from carrying on research in Europe under a Guggenheim Fellowship ... As the year ends, the National Defense effort is beginning to claim the services of a number of staff members. Presumably the coming year will see a large intensification of the effort, though it is hoped that the interference with the regular research and teaching will not be too severe.&quot; (p. 129)
* 1942: This told a very different story. The defense effort had begun to &quot;involve a considerable number of personnel, as well as a good deal of administrative work. With the opening of the Radiation Laboratory of the National Defense Research Committee at the Institute, a number of members of the Department&#x27;s staff have become associated with that laboratory&quot; followed by a list of over 10 senior faculty who had, and several more gone to other defense projects. (p. 110-111)
* 1943 to 1945: Slater took leave of absence as chair, to work on topics of importance in radar. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1945.
* 1946: Slater had returned as chair. He starts his report: &quot;The year of reconversion from war to peace has been one of the very greatest activity. ... Physics during the war achieved an importance which has probably never before been attained by any other science. The Institute, as the leading technical institution of the country and probably the world, should properly have a physics department unequaled anywhere.&quot; He lists plans to meet this objective, that proliferate his administrative responsibilities. (p. 133-143)
:Setting up interdepartmental laboratories, by restructuring existing laboratories using, as a model, the conversion of the Radiation Laboratory into the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) by Julius Stratton and Albert Hill.
:Financing student assistantships and helping shape the role of government financing on an unprecedented scale.
:Overseeing Robley Evans&#x27; Radioactivity Center (containing a cyclotron) and Van de Graaff&#x27;s High Voltage Laboratory.
:Recruiting physicists familiar with the Manhattan project to build the Laboratory for Nuclear Science and Engineering. This was directed by Jerrold Zacharias. Its first members included Bruno Rossi and Victor Weisskopf.
:Setting up the Acoustics Laboratory, directed by Richard Bolt, and the Spectroscopy Laboratory directed by the chemist Richard Lord.
* 1947: With the hiring of staff and building of laboratories well in hand, Slater begins: &quot;The year in the Physics Department, as in the rest of the Institute, was one of starting the large-scale teaching of returned veterans and other students whose academic careers had been interrupted by the war.&quot; He goes on to discuss the needs of students, in the entire Institute, for Physics courses and laboratories, with particular mention of the upsurge in electronics and nuclear science, and he reports briefly on the developments following from his previous report. (p. 139-141)
* 1948: Slater begins &quot;The current year is the first since the war in which the department has approached normal operation. No new major projects or changes of policy have been introduced.&quot; But the department that he has built is vastly different from what it was when he started. Sixteen master&#x27;s degrees and 47 doctor&#x27;s degrees were granted. Twenty-five Ph.D. recipients got academic appointments in MIT and other universities. Research flourished, and many scientists visited from European universities and elsewhere in the U.S. (p. 141-143)
* 1949: The new-styled &#x27;normalcy&#x27; continued. &quot;The approach to a steady postwar state continued with few unusual occurrences.&quot; The graduate curriculum has been revised and cryogenics enhanced. The continued growth of staff, research grants, industrial contacts and volume of publication are treated as matters of continuity, recognizing at the end, that: &quot;The administrative load of the department has grown so much (it became) wise to appoint an executive officer&quot;. Nathaniel Frank, who had worked with John Slater for nearly two decades accepted the post. (p. 149-153)
* 1950: The future of the department had been set. There were &quot;few unexpected changes&quot;. And with the continued growth, &quot;almost every research project in the Department has concerned itself with undergraduate research&quot;. (p. 189-191)
* 1951: Jay Stratton writes &quot;Professor John C. Slater resigned as Head of the Department of Physics and has been appointed Harry B. Higgins Professor of the Solid State, the first appointment which will carry the title &quot;Institute Professor.&quot; Professor Slater has been granted a leave of absence for the coming year to carry on research at Brookhaven National Laboratory.&quot; (p. 30)

Throughout his Chairmanship, Slater taught, wrote books, produced ideas of major scientific importance, and interacted with colleagues throughout the local, national and international scientific communities. At the personal level, Morse states: &quot;Through most of (the 1930s) he looked more like an undergraduate than a department head ... he could render his guests weak with laughter simply by counting ... in Danish.&quot; Much later, S.B. Trickey wrote &quot;While I got to know him reasonably well, I was never able to call J.C. Slater by his given name. His seeming aloofness turned out more to be shyness.&quot;

== Research ==

===Atoms, molecules and solids: research preceding World War II===
Returning in time to 1920, Slater had gone to Harvard to work for a Ph.D. with Percy Bridgman, who studied the behaviour of substances under very high pressures. Slater measured the compressibility of common salt and ten other alkali halides—compounds of lithium, sodium, potassium and rubidium, with fluorine, chlorine and bromine. He described the results as &quot;exactly in accord with Bohr&#x27;s recent views of the relation between electron structure and the periodic table&quot;. This brought Slater&#x27;s observation concerning the mechanical properties of ionic crystals into line with the theory that Bohr had based on the spectroscopy of gaseous elements. He wrote the alkali halide paper in 1923, having &quot;by the summer of 1922&quot; been &quot;thoroughly indoctrinated ... with quantum theory&quot;, in part by the courses of Edwin Kemble following a fascination with Bohr&#x27;s work during his undergraduate days. In 1924, Slater went to Europe on a Harvard Sheldon Fellowship. After a brief stay at the University of Cambridge, he went on to the University of Copenhagen, where &quot;he explained to Bohr and Kramers his idea (that was) a sort of forerunner of the duality principle, (hence) the celebrated paper&quot; on the work that others dubbed the Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory. &quot;Slater suddenly became an internationally known name.&quot;. Interest in this &quot;old-quantum-theory&quot; paper subsided with the arrival of full quantum mechanics, but Philp M. Morse&#x27;s biography states that &quot;in recent years it has been recognized that the correct ideas in the article are those of Slater.&quot; Slater discusses his early life through the trip to Europe in a transcribed interview.

Slater joined the Harvard faculty on his return from Europe in 1925, then moved to MIT in 1930. His research papers covered many topics. A year by year selection, up to his switch to work relating to radar includes:
* 1924: the theoretical part of his Ph.D. work, the Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory,
* 1925: widths of spectral lines; ideas that came very close to the electron spins principle,
* 1926 and 1927: explicit attention to electron spin, and to the Schrödinger equation;
* 1928: the Hartree self-consistent field, the Rydberg formula,
* 1929: the determinantal expression for an antisymmetric wave function,
* 1930: Slater type orbitals (STOs) and atomic shielding constants,
* 1931: linear combination of atomic orbitals, van der Waals forces (with Jack Kirkwood, as a Chemistry Research Associate).
* 1932 to 1935: atomic orbitals, metallic conduction, application of the Thomas–Fermi method to metals,
* 1936: ferromagnetism, (with Erik Rudberg, later chairman of the Nobel Prize committee for Physics) inelastic scattering, and (with his Ph.D. student William Shockley and close to his own Ph.D. topic), optical properties of alkali halides
* 1937 and 1938: augmented plane waves, superconductivity, ferromagnetism, electrodynamics,
* 1939 he published &quot;only&quot; a book: the definitive &quot;Introduction to Chemical Physics&quot;,
* 1940 the Grüneisen constant, and the Curie point,
* 1941 phase transition analogous to ferromagnetism in potassium dihydrogen phosphate.

In his memoir, Morse wrote &quot;In addition to other notable papers ... on ... Hartree&#x27;s self-consistent field, the quantum mechanical derivation of the Rydberg constant, and the best values of atomic shielding constants, he wrote a seminal paper on directing valency &quot; (what became known, later, as linear combination of atomic orbitals).
In further comments, John Van Vleck pays particular attention to (1) the 1925 study of the spectra of hydrogen and ionized helium, that J.V.V. considers one sentence short of proposing electron spin (which would have led to sharing a Nobel prize), and (2) what J.V.V. regards as Slater&#x27;s greatest paper, that introduced the mathematical object now called the Slater determinant. &quot;These were some of the achievements (that led to his) election to the National Academy ... at ... thirty-one. He played a key role in lifting American theoretical physics to high international standing.&quot; Slater&#x27;s doctoral students, during this time, included Nathan Rosen Ph.D. in 1932 for a theoretical study of the hydrogen molecule, and William Shockley Ph.D. 1936 for an energy band structure of sodium chloride, who later received a Nobel Prize for the discovery of the transistor.

===Research during the war and the return to peace time activities===
Slater, in his experimental and theoretical work on the magnetron (key elements paralleled his prior work with self-consistent fields for atoms) and on other topics at the Radiation Laboratory and at the Bell Laboratories did &quot;more than any other person to provide the understanding requisite to progress in the microwave field&quot;, in the words of Mervin Kelley, then head of Bell Labs, quoted by Morse.

Slater&#x27; publications during the war and the post-war recovery include a book and papers on microwave transmission and microwave electronics, linear accelerators, cryogenics, and, with Francis Bitter and several other colleagues, superconductors, These publications credit the many other scientists, mathematicians and engineers who participated. Among these, George H. Vineyard received his Ph.D. with Slater in 1943 for a study of space charge in the cavity magnetron. Later, he became director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and President of the American Physical Society. The work of the Radiation Laboratory paralleled research at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in England and the groups maintained a productive liaison.

===The Solid State and Molecular Theory Group===

====Activities====
In the words of Robert Nesbet: &quot;Slater founded the SSMTG with the idea of bringing together a younger generation of students and PostDocs with a common interest in the electronic structure and properties of atoms, molecules and solids. This was in part to serve as a balance for electronic physics to survive the overwhelming growth of nuclear physics following the war&quot; .

George F. Koster soon completed his Ph.D., joined the faculty, and became the senior member of the group. He wrote &quot;During the fifteen-year life of the group some sixty persons were members and thirty-four took doctoral degrees with theses connected with its work. In my report I have been unable to separate the work of Slater from that of the group as a whole. He was part of every aspect of the group&#x27;s research efforts.&quot;

Nesbet continued, &quot;Every morning in SSMTG began with a coffee session, chaired by Professor Slater, with the junior members seated around a long table ... Every member of the group was expected to contribute a summary of his own work and ideas to the Quarterly Progress Report&quot;. The SMMTG QPRs had a wide distribution to university and industrial research libraries, and to individual laboratories. They were quoted widely for scientific and biographical content, in journal articles and government reports and libraries are starting to put them online.

To begin the work of the group, Slater &quot;distilled his experience with the Hartree self-consistent field method&quot; into (1) a simplification that became known as the Xα method, and (2) a relationship between a feature of this method and a magnetic property of the system. These required computations that were excessive for &quot;pencil and paper&quot; work. Slater was quick to avail the SSMTG of the electronic computers that were being developed. An early paper on augmented plane waves used an IBM card programmed calculator. The Whirlwind was used heavily, then the IBM 704 in the MIT Computation Center and then the IBM 709 in the Cooperative Computing Laboratory (see below).

Solid state work progressed more rapidly at first in the SSMTG, with contributions over the first few years by George F. Koster, John Wood, Arthur Freeman and Leonard Mattheis. Molecular and atomic calculations also flourished in the hands of Fernando J. Corbató, Lee Allen and Alvin Meckler. This initial work followed lines largely set by Slater. Michael Barnett came in 1958. He and John Wood were given faculty appointments. Robert Nesbet, Brian Sutcliffe, Malcolm Harrison and Levente Szasz brought in a variety of further approaches to molecular and atomic problems. Jens Dahl, Alfred Switendick, Jules Moskowitz, Donald Merrifield and Russell Pitzer did further work on molecules, and Fred Quelle on solids.

Slater rarely included his name on the papers of SSMTG members who worked with him. Major pieces of work which he did coauthor dealt with applications of (1) group theory in band structure calculations and (2) equivalent features of linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO), tight binding and Bloch electron approximations, to interpolate results for the energy levels of solids, obtained by more accurate methods,

===Slater&#x27;s further activities at MIT during this time===
In the 1962 President&#x27;s Report, Jay Stratton wrote (on p. 17) &quot;A faculty committee under the chairmanship of Professor John C. Slater has taken primary responsibility for planning the facilities in the new Center for Materials. These include a new Cooperative Computing Laboratory completed this year and equipped with an I.B.M. 709 Computer&quot;.

The name &quot;Center for Materials Science and Engineering&quot; (CMSE) was adopted soon afterward. It embodied the ethos of interdepartmental research and teaching that Slater had espoused throughout his career. The first director was R.A. Smith, previously head of the physics division of the Royal Radar Establishment in England. He, Slater and Charles Townes, the provost, had been in close acquaintance since the early years of World War II, working on overlapping topics.

The center was set up, in accordance with Slater&#x27;s plans. It &quot;supported research and teaching in Metallurgy and Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering&quot;, and preserved MIT as a focus for work in solid state physics. By 1967, two years after Slater left, the MIT Physics Department &quot;had a very, very small commitment to condensed matter physics&quot; because it was so &quot;heavily into high energy physics.&quot; But in the same year, the CMSE staff included 55 professors and 179 graduate students. The Center continues to flourish in the 21st century.

The Cooperative Computing Laboratory (CCL) was used, in its first year by some 400 faculty, students and staff. These included (1) members of the SSMTG and the CCL running quantum mechanical calculations and non-numeric applications directed by Slater, Koster, Wood and Barnett, (2) the computer-aided design team of Ross, Coons and Mann, (3) members of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science, (4) Charney and Phillips in theoretical meteorology, and (5) Simpson and Madden in geophysics (from 1964 President&#x27;s report, p. 336-337).

== Personal life and death ==
In 1926, he had married Helen Frankenfeld. Their three children (Louise Chapin, John Frederick, and Clarke Rothwell) all followed academic careers. Slater was divorced and in 1954 he married Rose Mooney, a physicist and crystallographer, who moved to Florida with him in 1965.

At the University of Florida (Gainesville) where the retirement age was 70, Slater was able to enjoy another five years of active research and publication as a research professor in the Quantum Theory Project (QTP). In 1975, in his scientific autobiography, he wrote: &quot;The Florida Physics Department was a congenial one, with main emphasis on solid state physics, statistical physics and related fields. It reminded me of the MIT department in the days when I had been department head there. It was a far cry from the MIT Physics Department which I was leaving; by then it had been literally captured by the nuclear theorists.&quot; Slater published to the end of his life: his final journal paper, published with John Connolly in 1976, was on a novel approach to molecular orbital theory.

Slater died in Sanibel Island, Florida in 1976.

==As an educator and advisor==
Slater&#x27;s concern for others is illustrated by a dialog that Richard Feynman relates. It took place at the end of Feynman&#x27;s undergraduate days at MIT, when he wanted to stay on to do a Ph.D. &quot;When I went to Professor Slater and told him of my intentions he said: &#x27;We will not have you here&#x27;. I said &#x27;What?&#x27; Slater said &#x27;Why do you think you should go to graduate school at MIT?&#x27; &#x27;Because it is the best school for science in the country&#x27; ... &#x27;That is why you should go to some other school. You should find out how the rest of the world is.&#x27; So I went to Princeton. ... Slater was right. And I often advise my students the same way. Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile.&quot;

==Summary==
From the memoir by Philip Morse: &quot;He contributed significantly to the start of the quantum revolution in physics; he was one of the very few American-trained physicists to do so. He was exceptional in that he persisted in exploring atomic, molecular and solid state physics, while many of his peers were coerced by war, or tempted by novelty, to divert to nuclear mysteries.&quot;

To paraphrase John Connolly, it can be said that the contributions of John C. Slater and his students in the SSMTG and the Quantum Theory Project laid the foundations of the density functional theory approximation in quantum theory.

Slater&#x27;s papers were bequeathed to the American Philosophical Society by his widow, Rose Mooney Slater, in 1980 and 1982. In August 2003, Alfred Switendick donated a collection of &quot;Quarterly Reports of the MIT Solid State and Molecular Theory Group (SSMTG)&quot;, dating from 1951 to 1965.

<text>In theology, apokatastasis (, , also spelled apocatastasis) is the restoration of creation to a condition of perfection. In Christianity, the term refers to a form of Christian universalism, often associated with Origen, that includes the ultimate salvation of everyone—including the damned and the Devil. The New Testament () speaks of the &quot;apokatastasis of all things.&#x27; The dogmatic status of apokatastasis is disputed, and some orthodox fathers such as Gregory of Nyssa taught apokatastasis and were never condemned.

==Etymology and definition==
While apokatastasis is derived from the Greek verb &quot;apokathistemi&quot;, which means &quot;to restore&quot;, it first emerged as a doctrine in Zoroastrianism where it is the third time of creation. This period was referred to as &quot;wizarishn&quot; or the end of history—the time of separation and resolution when evil is destroyed and the world is restored to its original state. The idea of apokatastasis may have been derived from the ancient concept of cosmic cycle, which involves the notion of celestial bodies returning to their original positions after a period of time.

The entry in &quot;A Greek–English Lexicon&quot; (i.e. &quot;Liddell–Scott–Jones&quot;, with expansion of definitions and references), gives the following examples of usage:

The word is reasonably common in papyri.

==Concepts==

===Stoicism===
According to Edward Moore, &quot;apokatastasis&quot; was first properly conceptualized in early Stoic thought, particularly by Chrysippus. The return (&quot;apokatastasis&quot;) of the planets and stars to their proper &quot;celestial signs&quot;, namely their original positions, would spark a conflagration of the universe (&quot;ekpyrosis&quot;). The original position was believed to consist of an alignment of celestial bodies with Cancer. Thereafter, from fire, rebirth would commence, and this cycle of alternate destruction and recreation was correlated with a divine Logos. &quot;Antapokatastasis&quot; is a counter-recurrence when the stars and planets align with Capricorn, which would mark destruction by a universal flood.

The Stoics identified Zeus with an alternately expanding and contracting fire constituting the universe. Its expansion was described as Zeus turning his thoughts outwards, resulting in the creation of the material cosmos, and its contraction, the &quot;apokatastasis&quot;, as Zeus returning to self-contemplation. Leibniz explored both Stoic and his understanding of Origen&#x27;s philosophy in two essays written shortly before his death, &quot;Apokatastasis&quot; and &quot;Apokatastasis panton&quot; (1715).

===Judaism===
The concept of &quot;restore&quot; or &quot;return&quot; in the Hebrew Bible is the common Hebrew verb , as used in , the only use of the verb form of apokatastasis in the Septuagint. This is used in the &quot;restoring&quot; of the fortunes of Job, and is also used in the sense of rescue or return of captives, and in the restoration of Jerusalem.

This is similar to the concept of tikkun olam in Hasidic Judaism.

===New Testament===
The word, &quot;apokatastasis&quot;, appears only once in the New Testament, in Acts 3:21. Peter healed a beggar with a disability and then addressed the astonished onlookers. His sermon set Jesus in the Jewish context, the fulfiller of the Abrahamic Covenant, and says:
Grammatically, the relative pronoun &quot;ὧν&quot; (&quot;of which&quot;, genitive plural), could refer either to &quot;χρόνων&quot; (&quot;of times&quot;) or to &quot;πάντων&quot; (&quot;of all&quot; or &quot;of all things&quot;), which means that it is either the times of which God spoke or the all things of which God spoke.

The usual view taken of Peter&#x27;s use of the &quot;&quot;apokatastasis&quot; of all the things about which God spoke&quot; is that it refers to the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel and/or the Garden of Eden and not &quot;all things that ever existed&quot;.

The verbal form of &quot;apokatastasis&quot; is found in the Septuagint: Malachi 3:23 (i.e. ); a prophecy of Elijah &quot;turning back&quot; the hearts of the children to their fathers; in (&quot;he will &quot;restore&quot; all things&quot;), echoing Malachi, and in (&quot;that I may be &quot;restored&quot; to you the sooner&quot;).

Nineteenth-century German theologian Jakob Eckermann interpreted &quot;the &#x27;apokatastasis of all things&#x27; to mean the universal emendation of religion by the doctrine of Christ, and the &#x27;times of refreshing&#x27; to be the day of renewal, the times of the Messiah.&quot;

===Patristic Christianity===
The significance of &quot;apokatastasis&quot; in early Christianity is currently something of a disputed question. In particular, some question whether Origen, often listed as the most notable advocate of universal salvation, did in fact teach or believe in such a doctrine.

Frederick W. Norris argues that the positions that Origen took on the issue of universal salvation have often seemed contradictory. He then writes that Origen never decided to stress exclusive salvation or universal salvation, to the strict exclusion of either case, therefore concludes that Origen probably kept his view of salvation economically &#x27;open&#x27; for a greater effectiveness. On the other hand, Brian E. Daley in his handbook of patristic eschatology argued that Origen strongly believed in the final salvation of all humans and sometimes referred to it as &quot;apokatastasis&quot;. More recently, leading Patristic scholar Ilaria Ramelli has concluded that not only did Origen embrace the doctrine of apokatastasis, but that it was central to all his theological and philosophical thought. She remarks, &quot;In Origen&#x27;s thought, the doctrine of apokatastasis is interwoven with his anthropology, eschatology, theology, philosophy of history, theodicy, and exegesis; for anyone who takes Origen&#x27;s thought seriously and with a deep grasp of it, it is impossible to separate the apokatastasis theory from all the rest, so as to reject it but accept the rest.&quot;

The Alexandrian school, the first Christian educational center, seems to have generally affirmed apokatastasis and adapted some Platonic terminology and ideas to Christianity while explaining and differentiating the new faith from all the others. Gregory of Nyssa is also understood to have espoused a universally salvific &quot;apokatastasis&quot;, though Maspero argues that Gregory spoke solely of universal resurrection and not of universal salvation. Universal salvation in the form of apokatastasis is also seen in the Ambrosiaster, attributed to Ambrose of Milan. Gregory of Nazianzus discussed it without reaching a decision.

Eventually, Origen started to be condemned throughout the early church in local councils, though not apokatastasis specifically. This changed definitively in the sixth century. A local Synod of Constantinople (543) condemned a form of apokatastasis as being Anathema, and the Anathema was formally submitted to the Fifth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (553). The term &quot;apokatastasis&quot; is mentioned in the 14th of the 15 anathemas against Origen of 553: &quot;If anyone shall say ... that in this pretended apokatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema.&quot;

Konstantinovsky (2009) states that the uses of &quot;apokatastasis&quot; in Christian writings prior to the Synod of Constantinople (543) and the anathemas (553) pronounced against &quot;Origenists&quot; and Evagrius Ponticus were neutral and referred primarily to concepts similar to the general &quot;restoration of all things spoken&quot; (&quot;restitutio omnium quae locutus est Deus&quot;) of Peter in Acts 3:21 and not for example the universal reconciliation of all souls which had ever been.

===Gnosticism===
The gnostic Gospel of Philip &quot;180–350c&quot; contains the term itself but does not teach universal reconciliation:
==In Christian theology==
===Early Christianity===
Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215) generally uses the term &quot;apokatastasis&quot; to refer to the &quot;restoration&quot; of the &quot;gnostic&quot; Christians, rather than that of the universe or of all Christians, but with universal implications. Origen&#x27;s stance is disputed, with some works saying he taught apokatastasis would involve universal salvation, even the absolute equality of all souls and spirits. Gregory of Nyssa&#x27;s notion of &quot;apokatastasis&quot; is also claimed to have involved universal salvation though in other respects it differed from Origen&#x27;s.

In early Christian theological usage, &quot;apokatastasis&quot; was couched as God&#x27;s eschatological victory over evil and believed to entail a purgatorial state. The word was still very flexible at that time, but in the mid-6th century, it became virtually a technical term, as it usually means today, to refer to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation.

Maximus the Confessor outlined God&#x27;s plan for &quot;universal&quot; salvation alongside warnings of final punishment for the wicked.
He divided apokatastasis into three restorations: of the virtuous individual, of nature, and of the sinful powers of the soul. While the last of these meant that even sinners will be restored to a clear knowledge of God, Maximus seems to have believed that they will not attain to the same communion with God as the righteous and thus will in a sense be eternally punished.

===Luther===
The Vulgate translation of &quot;apokatastasis&quot;, (&quot;the restitution of all things of which God has spoken&quot;), was taken up by Luther to mean the day of the restitution of the creation, but in Luther&#x27;s theology the day of restitution was also the day of resurrection and judgment, not the restitution of the wicked. In Luther&#x27;s Bible he rendered the Greek &quot;apokatastasis&quot; with the German ; &quot;will be brought back&quot;. This sense continued to be used in Lutheran sermons.

Luther explicitly disowned belief that the devils would ultimately reach blessedness.

===19th-century Universalism===
During the 19th and early 20th centuries several histories published by Universalists, including Hosea Ballou (1829), Thomas Whittemore (1830), John Wesley Hanson (1899) and George T. Knight (1911), argued that belief in universal reconciliation was found in early Christianity and in the Reformation, and ascribed Universalist beliefs to Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and others.

===Recent works===
In recent writing, apokatastasis is generally understood as involving some form of universal reconciliation, without necessarily attributing this understanding to Origen and other Fathers of the Church.
* Augustin Gretillat, in (1892), described &quot;apokatastasis&quot; as universal reconciliation.
* Heinrich Köstlin&#x27;s (1896), translated in the &quot;Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge&quot;, described &quot;apokatastasis&quot; as universal reconciliation.
* The 1911 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; defined apokatastasis as &quot;a name given in the history of theology to the doctrine which teaches that a time will come when all free creatures shall share in the grace of salvation; in a special way, the devils and lost souls.&quot;
* Maurice Canney, &quot;An Encyclopaedia of Religions&quot; (1921): &quot;Apocatastasis became a theological term denoting the doctrine ... that all men would be converted and admitted to everlasting happiness&quot;.
* Albrecht Oepke, &quot;Theological Dictionary of the New Testament&quot; (1933): &quot;Apokatastasis cannot denote the conversion of persons but only the reconstitution or establishment of things.&quot;
* Professor Constantinos A. Patrides surveyed the history of apokatastasis in his &quot;Salvation of Satan&quot;.
* G. C. Berkouwer, &quot;The Return of Christ&quot; (1972), devoted a whole chapter, under the heading &quot;Apocatastasis?&quot;, to the topic of universal reconciliation, &quot;sometimes technically known as apocatastasis&quot;.
* John Meyendorff, &quot;Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes&quot; (1987) defined apokatastasis as &quot;the idea that the whole of creation and all of humanity will ultimately be &#x27;restored&#x27; to their original state of bliss&quot;.
* Michael McGarry in &quot;A Dictionary of the Jewish-Christian Dialogue&quot; (1995) defined apokatastasis as &quot;one particular Christian expression of a general theology of universalism ... the belief that at the end of time all creatures—believers and sinners alike—would be restored in Christ&quot;.
* Peter Stravinskas, in the short article on apokatastasis in &quot;Our Sunday Visitor&#x27;s Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1998) and the still shorter entry in his &quot;Catholic Dictionary&quot; (1993), defines it as the belief &quot;that all rational creatures are saved, including the fallen angels and unrepentant sinners&quot;.
* Stravinskas identifies apokatastasis with universalism or universal reconciliation, and some of the older sources do so also. In addition, two recent works that do not discuss apokatastasis give the corresponding Greek word as the source from which &quot;universalism&quot; is derived. But most writers do not simply identify apokatastasis with universal reconciliation. González points out that a distinction exists, in that &quot;it is possible to hold universalist views without believing that all of creation will return to its original state&quot;.
* Both Ludlow and McGarry state that the word is today usually understood as referring to one specific doctrine of universal salvation, not to all versions of universalism.
* &quot;A Concise Dictionary of Theology&quot; (2000) describes apokatastasis as &quot;a theory ... that all angels and human beings, even the demons and the damned, will ultimately be saved&quot;.
* Morwenna Ludlow (2001), in &quot;Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the Thought of Gregory of Nyssa and Karl Rahner&quot;, writes that, though the meaning was very flexible until the mid-6th century, &quot;the word is now usually used to refer to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation&quot;.
* Peter L. Berger, in his book &quot;Questions of Faith&quot; (2003), calls apokatastasis &quot;the conviction that, in the end, all will be saved and the entire creation will be reconciled with God&quot;.

<text>Hula () is a Hawaiian dance form expressing chant (&quot;oli&quot;) or song (&quot;mele&quot;). It was developed in the Hawaiian Islands by the Native Hawaiians who settled there. The hula dramatizes or portrays the words of the oli or mele in a visual dance form.

There are many sub-styles of hula, with the two main categories being Hula ʻAuana and Hula Kahiko. Ancient hula, performed before Western encounters with Hawaii, is called &quot;kahiko&quot;. It is accompanied by chant and traditional instruments. Hula, as it evolved under Western influence in the 19th and 20th centuries, is called &quot;auana&quot; (a word that means &quot;to wander&quot; or &quot;drift&quot;). It is accompanied by song and Western-influenced musical instruments such as the guitar, the ukulele, and the double bass.

Terminology for two additional categories is beginning to enter the hula lexicon: &quot;Monarchy&quot; includes any hula which were composed and choreographed during the 19th century. During that time the influx of Western culture created significant changes in the formal Hawaiian arts, including hula. &quot;Ai Kahiko&quot;, meaning &quot;in the ancient style&quot; are those hula written in the 20th and 21st centuries that follow the stylistic protocols of the ancient hula kahiko.

There are also two main positions of a hula dance: either sitting ( dance) or standing ( dance). Some dances utilize both forms.
Hula dancing is complex, with many hand motions used to represent the words in a song or chant. For example, hand movements can signify aspects of nature, such as the swaying of a tree in the breeze or a wave in the ocean, or a feeling or emotion, such as fondness or yearning. Foot and hip movements often pull from a basic library of steps including the , , , , , and .

There are other related dances (tamure, hura, &#x27;aparima, &#x27;ote&#x27;a, haka, kapa haka, poi, Fa&#x27;ataupati, Tau&#x27;olunga, and Lakalaka) that come from other Polynesian islands such as Tahiti, The Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand; however, the hula is unique to the Hawaiian Islands.

Five hula genres can be placed across a spectrum with &quot;the most ancient&quot; on the left and &quot;the most modern&quot; on the right side. The Hula pahu and hula &#x27;āla&#x27;apapa subcategories are ancient, originating before the introduction of Christianity. Thanks to well-preserved documentation, guidelines for performers to bring the poetic text back on stage remain clear in manuscript sources. On the other side of the continuum, hapa haole songs are relatively modern and they were also disseminated as notated sheet music, the joint effort of contemporary ethnomusicologists and songwriters. The other the two hula types, hula ku&#x27;i and hula &#x27;ōlapa are a challenge to editors in terms of textualizing and representing them within a critical edition. These two genres reflect the social transformation and westernization within the region, influenced by American economics and politics. More importantly, the same strophic text format is applied in both genres, constructed with two or four lines of text, with each of them commonly set to a uniform number of beats. During performance, it is a usual practice that the songs are separated into stanzas which are repeated by a brief rhythmic interlude. Among the genres of hula, the corresponding melodic structure and the strophic musical structure make modern hula ku&#x27;i and hula &#x27;ōlapa distinguishable from the others.

==Hula kahiko==

Hula kahiko, often defined as those hula composed prior to 1894 which do not include modern instrumentation (such as guitar, ʻukulele, etc.), encompasses an enormous variety of styles and moods, from the solemn and sacred to the frivolous. Many hula were created to praise the chiefs and performed in their honor, or for their entertainment. Types of hula kahiko include ālaapapa, haa, ōlapa, and many others. Today hula kahiko is simply stated as &quot;Traditional&quot; Hula.

Many hula dances are considered to be a religious performance, as they are dedicated to, or honoring, a Hawaiian goddess or god. As was true of ceremonies at the heiau, the platform temple, even a minor error was considered to invalidate the performance. It might even be a presage of bad luck or have dire consequences. Dancers who were learning to do such hula necessarily made many mistakes. Hence they were ritually secluded and put under the protection of the goddess Laka during the learning period. Ceremonies marked the successful learning of the hula and the emergence from seclusion.

Hula kahiko is performed today by dancing to the historical chants. Many hula kahiko are characterized by traditional costuming, by an austere look, and a reverence for their spiritual root.

=== Chant (Oli) ===
Hawaiian history was oral history. It was codified in genealogies and chants, which were memorized and passed down. In the absence of a written language, this was the only available method of ensuring accuracy. Chants told the stories of creation, mythology, royalty, and other significant events and people.

The &quot;ʻŌlelo Noʻeau&quot; (Hawaiian saying or proverb), &quot;&quot;&#x27;O &#x27;oe ka luaʻahi o kāu mele&quot;,&quot; translates loosely as &quot;You bear both the good and the bad consequences of the poetry you compose&quot; The idea behind this saying originates from the ancient Hawaiian belief that language possessed mana, or &quot;power derived from a spiritual source&quot; particularly when delivered through &quot;oli&quot; (chant). Therefore, skillful manipulation of language by &quot;haku mele&quot; (composers) and chanters was of utmost reverence and importance. Oli was an integral component of ancient Hawaiian society, and arose in nearly every social, political and economic aspect of life.

Traditional chant types are extremely varied in context and technical components, and cover a broad range of specific functions. Among them (in vague descending order of sacredness) exist &quot;mele pule&quot; (prayer), &quot;hula kuahu&quot; (ritual dance), &quot;kūʻauhau&quot; (cosmogeny), &quot;koʻihonua&quot; (genealogy), &quot;hānau&quot; (birth), &quot;inoa&quot; (name), &quot;maʻi&quot; (procreation/genital), &quot;kanikau&quot; (lamentation), &quot;hei&quot; (game), &quot;hoʻoipoipo&quot; (love), and &quot;kāhea&quot; (expression/call out).
An important distinction between &quot;oli&quot;, &quot;hula&quot;, and &quot;mele&quot; is as follows: &quot;mele&quot; can hold many different meanings, and is often translated to mean simply, song. However, in a more broad sense, &quot;mele&quot; can be taken to mean poetry or linguistic composition. Hula (chant with dance) and oli (chant without dance) are two general styles in which mele can be used/performed. Generally, &quot;all mele may be performed as oli (chant without dance), but only certain types such as name chants, sex chants, love chants, and chants dedicated to the [&quot;&#x27;aumakua&quot;] gods of hula (ritual dance), may be performed as hula (chant with dance).&quot;

Hawaiian language contains 43 different words to describe voice quality; the technique and particularity of chanting styles is crucial to understanding their function. The combination of general style (with or without dance) and the context of the performance determines what vocal style a chant will use. &quot;Kepakepa, kāwele, olioli, ho&#x27;āeae, ho&#x27;ouēuē&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;aiha&#x27;a&quot; are examples of styles differentiated by vocal technique. &quot;Kepakepa&quot; sounds like rapid speech and is often spoken in long phrases. &quot;Olioli&quot; is a style many would liken to song, as it is melodic in nature and includes sustained pitches, often with &quot;&#x27;i&#x27;i&quot;, or vibrato of the voice that holds vowel tones at the ends of lines.

A law passed in Hawai&#x27;i in 1896 (shortly after American overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom) banned the use of &#x27;Ōlelo Hawai&#x27;i in schools. This, in combination with a general usurpation of Hawaiian social, political, and linguistic autonomy resulted in a mass decline of the Hawaiian language, to the near brink of extinction. As a result of Americanization, including the spread of Christianity, many traditional chants became viewed as pagan and were ultimately forgotten. But a cultural resurgence beginning in the late 1960s, and carrying through to today has revitalized many Hawaiian practices, including spoken language and chant, and has been furthered by increasing support from various institutions, including Pūnana Leo Hawaiian language immersion schools, funded by the Hawai&#x27;i State Department of Education as well as major hula competitions such as the Merrie Monarch Festival, which officially began in 1971.

In &quot;hālau hula&quot; (hula schools) asking permission to enter the space in order to partake in the knowledge of the &quot;kumu&quot; (teacher) is a key component to being a student. Many hālau use a variation of &quot;Kūnihi,&quot; an &quot;oli kāhea&quot;, most typically done in an &quot;olioli&quot; style. Students often stand outside the entrance and chant repeatedly until the kumu decides to grant them permission to enter, and uses a different chant in response. This is an example of how oli is integrated into modern day cultural practices, within the context of hula training.

Oli is universally considered as the most typical type of indigenous music that is not constructed onto meters. In fact, the artistic expression of oli varies according to the circumstances where the performance is conducted, which is also the reason why there are five different articulatory vocal techniques were developed in oli repertoire. These five styles are:

* &quot;kepakepa&quot;: A conversational patter that is expected to be performed swiftly, where the syllables are usually too short to allow pitches to be identified.
* &quot;kawele&quot;: Comparing with the kepakepa, syllables are sustained a bit longer in kawele, but yet to be easily identified in pitches. It tends to be a more suitable form for recitation and declamation among Olis.
* &quot;olioli&quot;: It is regarded as the most commonly used kind of oli, which the sustained pitch monotone carries the poetic form in a more vocally-embellished way.
* &quot;ho&#x27;āeae&quot;: It uses sustained pitches more often and there can be multiple pitches following fundamental configuration throughout the musical context.
* &quot;ho&#x27;ouweuwe&quot;: it is exclusively applied as the laments in funeral.

Oli performer does not purposely learn repertoire with the aim of merely learning the melodies, but the performative techniques. The most important thing for performer to master is decide which style the poetic text can be perfectly fitted into and figure out the way that can flawlessly combine both the text and the oli style according to the given context, such time limits and the particular situation where the oli is delivered.

===Instruments and implements===
* &quot;Ipu&quot;—single gourd drum
* &quot;Ipu heke&quot;—double gourd drum
* &quot;Pahu&quot;—sharkskin covered drum; considered sacred
* &quot;Puniu&quot;—small knee drum made of a coconut shell with fish skin (kala) cover
* &quot;Iliili&quot;—water-worn lava stone used as castanets
* &quot;Ulīulī&quot;—feathered gourd rattles (also ulili)
* &quot;Pūili&quot;—split bamboo sticks
* &quot;Kālaau&quot;—rhythm sticks

The dog&#x27;s-tooth anklets sometimes worn by male dancers could also be considered instruments, as they underlined the sounds of stamping feet.

=== Dress/outfits ===

Traditional female dancers wore the everyday &quot;pāū&quot;, or wrapped skirt, but were topless. Today this form of dress has been altered. As a sign of lavish display, the pāū might be much longer than the usual length of tapa, or barkcloth, which was just long enough to go around the waist. Visitors report seeing dancers swathed in many yards of tapa, enough to increase their circumference substantially. Dancers might also wear decorations such as necklaces, bracelets, and anklets, as well as many lei (in the form of headpieces (lei poʻo), necklaces, bracelets, and anklets (kupeʻe)), and other accessories.

A skirt of green kī (&quot;Cordyline fruticosa&quot;) leaves may also be worn over the &quot;pāū&quot;. They are arranged in a dense layer of around fifty leaves. Kī were sacred to the goddess of the forest and the hula dance Laka, and as such, only &quot;kahuna&quot; and &quot;aliʻi&quot; were allowed to wear kī leaf leis (&quot;lei lāʻī&quot;) during religious rituals. Similar &quot;C. fruticosa&quot; leaf skirts worn over &quot;tupenu&quot; are also used in religious dances in Tonga, where it is known as &quot;sisi&quot;. However, Tongan leaf skirts generally use red and yellow leaves.

Traditional male dancers wore the everyday malo, or loincloth. Again, they might wear bulky malo made of many yards of tapa. They also wore necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and lei.

The materials for the lei worn in performance were gathered in the forest, after prayers to Laka and the forest gods had been chanted.

The lei and tapa worn for sacred hula were considered imbued with the sacredness of the dance, and were not to be worn after the performance. Lei were typically left on the small altar to Laka found in every hālau, as offerings.

=== Performances ===

Hula performed for spontaneous daily amusement or family feasts were attended with no particular ceremony. However, hula performed as entertainment for chiefs were anxious affairs. High chiefs typically traveled from one place to another within their domains. Each locality had to house, feed, and amuse the chief and his or her entourage. Hula performances were a form of fealty, and often of flattery to the chief. During the performances the males would start off and the females would come later to close the show off. Most kahiko performances would begin with an opening dance, kai, and end with a closing dance, hoi, to state the presence of the hula. There were hula celebrating his lineage, his name, and even his genitals (hula mai). Sacred hula, celebrating Hawaiian gods, were also danced. All these performances must be completed without error (which would be both unlucky and disrespectful).

Visiting chiefs from other domains would also be honored with hula performances. This courtesy was often extended to important Western visitors.

== Hula auana ==
Modern hula arose from adaptation of traditional hula ideas (dance and mele) to Western influences. The primary influences were Christian morality and melodic harmony. Hula auana still tells or comments on a story, but the stories may include events since the 1800s. The costumes of the women dancers are less revealing and the music is heavily Western-influenced.

=== Songs ===
The mele of hula auana are generally sung as if they were popular music. A lead voice sings in a major scale, with occasional harmony parts.

The subject of the songs is as broad as the range of human experience. People write mele hula auana to comment on significant people, places or events or simply to express an emotion or idea.

While the whole Hawaiian repertoire can be mainly categorised into two sides, hula kahiko and hula &#x27;auana, the sound accompaniments have been regarded as one of the symbolic signs to distinguish them. In indigenous Hawaiian music, poetic text has always been an essential artistic element. It was documented that early Hawaiian musicians did not really focus on elaborating pure instrumental music but simply used the nose-blown flute that can only produce no more than four notes. However, after the Hawaiian culture met with Western music, some Hawaiian musicians developed several instrument-playing techniques in which the traditional Hawaiian repertoire was embedded. For example, the appearance of a Hawaiian guitar-playing method, named &quot;steel guitar&quot;, was attributed to the perfect combination happened when guitarist is muting the strings with a steel bar; another guitar-playing approach, &quot;slack key guitar&quot;, requires musician to tune the guitar by slackening the strings and pluck out main melody with the high-pitched strings when the lower-pitched strings are also worked on for the production of constant bass pattern.

=== Instruments ===
The musicians performing hula auana will typically use portable acoustic stringed instruments.

* Steel guitar—accents the vocalist
* Bass—maintains the rhythm

Occasional hula auana call for the dancers to use implements, in which case they will use the same instruments as for hula kahiko. Often dancers use the Ulīulī (feathered gourd rattle).

=== Regalia ===

The traditional Hawaiian hula costume includes kapa cloth skirts and men in just the malo (loincloth) however, during 1880s hula &#x27;auana was developed from western influences. It is during this period that the grass skirt began to be seen everywhere although, Hula &#x27;auana costumes are usually more western-looking, with dresses for women and pants for men.

Regalia plays a role in illustrating the hula instructor&#x27;s interpretation of the mele. From the color of their attire to the type of adornment worn, each piece of an auana costume symbolizes a piece of the mele auana, such as the color of a significant place or flower. While there is some freedom of choice, most hālau follow the accepted costuming traditions. Women generally wear skirts or dresses of some sort. Men may wear long or short pants, skirts, or a malo (a cloth wrapped under and around the groin). For slow, graceful dances, the dancers will wear formal clothing such as a muumuu for women and a sash for men. A fast, lively, &quot;rascal&quot; song will be performed by dancers in more revealing or festive attire. The hula kahiko is always performed with bare feet, but the hula auana can be performed with bare feet or shoes. In the old times, they had their leis and other jewelry but their clothing was much different. Females wore a wrap called a &quot;paʻu&quot; made of tapa cloth and men wore loincloths, which are called &quot;malo.&quot; Both sexes are said to have gone without a shirt. Their ankle and wrist bracelets, called &quot;kupeʻe&quot;, were made of whalebone and dogteeth as well as other items made from nature. Some of these make music-shells and bones will rattle against each other while the dancers dance.
Women perform most Hawaiian hula dances. Female hula dancers usually wear colorful tops and skirts with lei. However, traditionally, men were just as likely to perform the hula.
A grass skirt is a skirt that hangs from the waist and covers all or part of the legs. Grass skirts were made of many different natural fibers, such as hibiscus or palm.

==Training==

Hula is taught in schools or groups called &quot;hālau&quot;. The teacher of hula is the &quot;kumu hula&quot;. &quot;Kumu&quot; means &quot;source of knowledge&quot;, or literally &quot;teacher&quot;.

Often there is a hierarchy in hula schools - starting with the (teacher), (leader), (helpers), and then the (dancers) or (students). This is not true for every hālau, but it does occur often. Most, if not all, hula hālau have a permission chant in order to enter wherever they may practice. They will collectively chant their entrance chant, then wait for the kumu to respond with the entrance chant, once he or she is finished, the students may enter. One well known and often used entrance or permission chant is Kūnihi Ka Mauna/Tūnihi Ta Mauna.

== History ==

=== Legendary origins ===
There are various legends surrounding the origins of hula.

According to one Hawaiian legend, Laka, goddess of the hula, gave birth to the dance on the island of Molokai, at a sacred place in Kaana. After Laka died, her remains were hidden beneath the hill &quot;Puu Nana&quot;.

Another story tells of &quot;Hiiaka&quot;, who danced to appease her fiery sister, the volcano goddess Pele. This story locates the source of the hula on Hawaii, in the Puna district at the Hāena shoreline. The ancient hula &quot;Ke Haa Ala Puna&quot; describes this event.

Another story is that Pele, the goddess of fire, was trying to find a home for herself running away from her sister Namakaokahaʻi (the goddess of the oceans) when she finally found an island where she couldn&#x27;t be touched by the waves. There at a chain of craters on the island of Hawai&#x27;i she danced the first dance of hula signifying that she finally won.

Kumu Hula (or &quot;hula master&quot;) Leato S. Savini of the Hawaiian cultural academy Hālau Nā Mamo O Tulipa, located in Waianae, Japan, and Virginia, believes that hula goes as far back as what the Hawaiians call the &quot;Kumulipo&quot;, or account of how the world was made first and foremost through the god of life and water, Kane. Kumu Leato is cited as saying, &quot;When Kane and the other gods of our creation, Lono, Kū, and Kanaloa created the earth, the man, and the woman, they recited incantations which we call Oli or Chants and they used their hands and moved their legs when reciting these oli. Therefore this is the origin of hula.&quot;

=== 19th century ===

American Protestant missionaries, who arrived in 1820, often denounced the hula as a heathen dance holding vestiges of paganism. The newly Christianized alii (royalty and nobility) were urged to ban the hula. In 1830 Queen Kaʻahumanu forbade public performances. However, many of them continued to privately patronize the hula. By the 1850s, public hula was regulated by a system of licensing.

The Hawaiian performing arts had a resurgence during the reign of King David Kalākaua (1874–1891), who encouraged the traditional arts. With the Princess Lili&#x27;uokalani who devoted herself to the old ways, as the patron of the ancients chants (mele, hula), she stressed the importance to revive the diminishing culture of their ancestors within the damaging influence of foreigners and modernism that was forever changing Hawaii.

Practitioners merged Hawaiian poetry, chanted vocal performance, dance movements and costumes to create the new form, the &quot;hula kui&quot; (kui means &quot;to combine old and new&quot;). The appears not to have been used in hula kui, evidently because its sacredness was respected by practitioners; the gourd (&quot;Lagenaria sicenaria&quot;) was the indigenous instrument most closely associated with hula kui.

Ritual and prayer surrounded all aspects of hula training and practice, even as late as the early 20th century. Teachers and students were dedicated to the goddess of the hula, Laka.

=== 20th century hula dancing ===
Hula changed drastically in the early 20th century as it was featured in tourist spectacles, such as the Kodak Hula Show, and in Hollywood films. Vaudeville star Signe Paterson was instrumental in raising its profile and popularity on the American stage, performing the hula in New York and Boston, teaching society figures the dance, and touring the country with the Royal Hawaiian Orchestra. However, a more traditional hula was maintained in small circles by older practitioners. There has been a renewed interest in hula, both traditional and modern, since the 1970s and the Hawaiian Renaissance.

In response to several Pacific island sports teams using their respective native war chants and dances as pre-game ritual challenges. in 2007 the University of Hawaii football team started doing a war chant and dance called the &quot;ha&#x27;a&quot; before games, using the native Hawaiian language.

Since 1964, the Merrie Monarch Festival has become an annual one week long hula competition held in the spring that attracts visitors from all over the world. It is to honor King David Kalākaua who was known as the Merrie Monarch as he revived the art of hula.

<text>Robert Nelson (August 8, 1794 – March 1, 1873) was an Anglo-Quebecer physician and a leading figure in the Lower Canada Rebellion in 19th century Quebec (Lower Canada).

Nelson was born in Sorel (near Montreal) to William Nelson, an immigrant to Colonial America from Newsham, North Yorkshire. His mother, Jane Dies, was a teacher and daughter of an important land owner in the New York area. He studied medicine in Montreal and later at Harvard University, in the state of Massachusetts. During the War of 1812, he was surgeon for the Deschambault Corps and the Indian Braves Corps.

In 1827, Robert Nelson entered politics at the invitation of his brother, Wolfred Nelson, also a doctor and member of the Parti Patriote. On November 24, 1837, Nelson was arrested with other politicians. He was freed soon after, not being involved with the rebels, unlike his brother, Wolfred, who participated in the Battle of Saint-Denis. His arrest, however, led him to join with the rebels who fled to the United States. The leaders of the Patriotes voted for the quick establishment of a provisional government and the launch of an attack from the United States. Some important Patriotes voted against this idea, including Louis-Joseph Papineau. Robert Nelson was made General of the army and elected future President of the Republic of Lower Canada.

On February 28, 1838, Nelson encamped at Alburg, Vermont with some 300 men. He proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Lower Canada and distributed copies of a declaration of independence. Soon after, they were arrested by the U.S. Army for violation of the law of neutrality of the United States. A jury, sympathetic to the Patriotes cause, acquitted him and others.

After this failed attempt, Robert Nelson and other insurrectionists decided to take the time to organize a new strike. A clandestine paramilitary association, known as the Frères chasseurs, was set up to overthrow the British colonial governments of Lower and Upper Canada and establish sovereign and democratic republics in their place. A second invasion started on November 3, 1838. Things didn&#x27;t go as planned and the invasion forces were forced to retreat.

Nelson and others were eventually granted amnesty by the British colonial government and allowed to return home.

Robert Nelson died in 1873 at the age of 78 in Staten Island, New York. He was interred in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

<text>The AKS primality test (also known as Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test and cyclotomic AKS test) is a deterministic primality-proving algorithm created and published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena, computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, on August 6, 2002, in an article titled &quot;PRIMES is in P&quot;. The algorithm was the first one which is able to determine in polynomial time, whether a given number is prime or composite without relying on mathematical conjectures such as the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The proof is also notable for not relying on the field of analysis. In 2006 the authors received both the Gödel Prize and Fulkerson Prize for their work.

==Importance==
AKS is the first primality-proving algorithm to be simultaneously &quot;general&quot;, &quot;polynomial-time&quot;, &quot;deterministic&quot;, and &quot;unconditionally correct&quot;. Previous algorithms had been developed for centuries and achieved three of these properties at most, but not all four. 
* The AKS algorithm can be used to verify the primality of any general number given. Many fast primality tests are known that work only for numbers with certain properties. For example, the Lucas–Lehmer test works only for Mersenne numbers, while Pépin&#x27;s test can be applied to Fermat numbers only.
* The maximum running time of the algorithm can be bounded by a polynomial over the number of digits in the target number. ECPP and APR conclusively prove or disprove that a given number is prime, but are not known to have polynomial time bounds for all inputs.
* The algorithm is guaranteed to distinguish deterministically whether the target number is prime or composite. Randomized tests, such as Miller–Rabin and Baillie–PSW, can test any given number for primality in polynomial time, but are known to produce only a probabilistic result.
* The correctness of AKS is not conditional on any subsidiary unproven hypothesis. In contrast, Miller&#x27;s version of the Miller–Rabin test is fully deterministic and runs in polynomial time over all inputs, but its correctness depends on the truth of the yet-unproven generalized Riemann hypothesis.

While the algorithm is of immense theoretical importance, it is not used in practice, rendering it a galactic algorithm. For 64-bit inputs, the Baillie–PSW test is deterministic and runs many orders of magnitude faster. For larger inputs, the performance of the (also unconditionally correct) ECPP and APR tests is &quot;far&quot; superior to AKS. Additionally, ECPP can output a primality certificate that allows independent and rapid verification of the results, which is not possible with the AKS algorithm.

==Concepts==
The AKS primality test is based upon the following theorem: Given an integer formula_1 and integer formula_2 coprime to formula_3, formula_3 is prime if and only if the polynomial congruence relation

holds within the polynomial ring formula_5. Note that formula_6 denotes the indeterminate which generates this polynomial ring.

This theorem is a generalization to polynomials of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. In one direction it can easily be proven using the binomial theorem together with the following property of the binomial coefficient:
:formula_7 for all formula_8 if formula_3 is prime.

While the relation () constitutes a primality test in itself, verifying it takes exponential time: the brute force approach would require the expansion of the formula_10 polynomial and a reduction formula_11 of the resulting formula_12 coefficients.

The congruence is an equality in the polynomial ring formula_5. Evaluating in a quotient ring of formula_5 creates an upper bound for the degree of the polynomials involved. The AKS evaluates the equality in formula_15, making the computational complexity dependent on the size of formula_16. For clarity, this is expressed as the congruence

which is the same as:

for some polynomials formula_17 and formula_18.

Note that all primes satisfy this relation (choosing formula_19 in () gives (), which holds for formula_3 prime). This congruence can be checked in polynomial time when formula_16 is polynomial to the digits of formula_3. The AKS algorithm evaluates this congruence for a large set of formula_2 values, whose size is polynomial to the digits of formula_3. The proof of validity of the AKS algorithm shows that one can find an formula_16 and a set of formula_2 values with the above properties such that if the congruences hold then formula_3 is a power of a prime.

==History and running time==
In the first version of the above-cited paper, the authors proved the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm to be formula_28 (using Õ from big O notation)—the twelfth power of the number of digits in &quot;n&quot; times a factor that is polylogarithmic in the number of digits. However, this upper bound was rather loose; a widely-held conjecture about the distribution of the Sophie Germain primes would, if true, immediately cut the worst case down to formula_29.

In the months following the discovery, new variants appeared (Lenstra 2002, Pomerance 2002, Berrizbeitia 2002, Cheng 2003, Bernstein 2003a/b, Lenstra and Pomerance 2003), which improved the speed of computation greatly. Owing to the existence of the many variants, Crandall and Papadopoulos refer to the &quot;AKS-class&quot; of algorithms in their scientific paper &quot;On the implementation of AKS-class primality tests&quot;, published in March 2003.

In response to some of these variants, and to other feedback, the paper &quot;PRIMES is in P&quot; was updated with a new formulation of the AKS algorithm and of its proof of correctness. (This version was eventually published in &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;.) While the basic idea remained the same, &quot;r&quot; was chosen in a new manner, and the proof of correctness was more coherently organized. The new proof relied almost exclusively on the behavior of cyclotomic polynomials over finite fields. The new upper bound on time complexity was formula_30, later reduced using additional results from sieve theory to formula_31.

In 2005, Pomerance and Lenstra demonstrated a variant of AKS that runs in formula_32 operations, leading to another updated version of the paper. Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena proposed a variant which would run in formula_33 if Agrawal&#x27;s conjecture were true; however, a heuristic argument by Pomerance and Lenstra suggested that it is probably false.

==The algorithm==
The algorithm is as follows:

: Input: integer .
# Check if &quot;n&quot; is a perfect power: if for integers and , then output &quot;composite&quot;.
# Find the smallest &quot;r&quot; such that . If &quot;r&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are not coprime, then output &quot;composite&quot;.
# For all 2 ≤ &quot;a&quot; ≤ min (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;n&quot;−1), check that &quot;a&quot; does not divide &quot;n&quot;: If &quot;a&quot;|&quot;n&quot; for some 2 ≤ &quot;a&quot; ≤ min (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;n&quot;−1), then output &quot;composite&quot;.
# If &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;, then output &quot;prime&quot;.
# For to formula_34 do
#: if (&quot;X&quot;+&quot;a&quot;)&quot;n&quot; ≠ &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+&quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;X&quot;&quot;r&quot; − 1,&quot;n&quot;), then output &quot;composite&quot;;
# Output &quot;prime&quot;.

Here ord&quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the multiplicative order of &quot;n&quot; modulo &quot;r&quot;, log2 is the binary logarithm, and formula_35 is Euler&#x27;s totient function of &quot;r&quot;.

Step 3 is shown in the paper as checking 1 &lt; gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) &lt; &quot;n&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;. It can be seen this is equivalent to trial division up to &quot;r&quot;, which can be done very efficiently without using gcd. Similarly the comparison in step 4 can be replaced by having the trial division return &quot;prime&quot; once it has checked all values up to and including formula_36

Once beyond very small inputs, step 5 dominates the time taken. The essential reduction in complexity (from exponential to polynomial) is achieved by performing all calculations in the finite ring
: formula_37
consisting of formula_38 elements. This ring contains only the formula_16 monomials formula_40, and the coefficients are in formula_41 which has formula_3 elements, all of them codable within formula_43 bits.

Most later improvements made to the algorithm have concentrated on reducing the size of &quot;r,&quot; which makes the core operation in step 5 faster, and in reducing the size of &quot;s&quot;, the number of loops performed in step 5. Typically these changes do not change the computational complexity, but can lead to many orders of magnitude less time taken; for example, Bernstein&#x27;s final version has a theoretical speedup by a factor of over 2 million.

===Proof of validity outline===
For the algorithm to be correct, all steps that identify &quot;n&quot; must be correct. Steps 1, 3, and 4 are trivially correct, since they are based on direct tests of the divisibility of &quot;n&quot;. Step 5 is also correct: since (2) is true for any choice of &quot;a&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot; and &quot;r&quot; if &quot;n&quot; is prime, an inequality means that &quot;n&quot; must be composite.

The difficult part of the proof is showing that step 6 is true. Its proof of correctness is based on the upper and lower bounds of a multiplicative group in formula_44 constructed from the (&quot;X&quot; + &quot;a&quot;) binomials that are tested in step 5. Step 4 guarantees that these binomials are formula_34 distinct elements of formula_46. For the particular choice of &quot;r&quot;, the bounds produce a contradiction unless &quot;n&quot; is prime or a power of a prime. Together with the test of step 1, this implies that &quot;n&quot; is always prime at step 6.

===Example 1: &quot;n&quot; = 31 is prime===
Where PolynomialMod is a term-wise modulo reduction of the polynomial. e.g. PolynomialMod[x+2x2+3x3, 3] = x+2x2+0x3

<text>Wolfred Nelson (10 July 1791 – 17 June 1863) was the mayor of Montreal, Quebec, from 1854 to 1856.

== Biography ==

Nelson was born in Montreal. His father, William Nelson, was an immigrant to Colonial America from Newsham, North Yorkshire, England. His mother, Jane Dies, was a teacher and daughter of an important land owner in the New York area.

Along with his younger brother Robert Nelson, he was known as a member of the Patriotes and for his leading role in the Lower Canada Rebellion.

Nelson studied at the school of his father in William Henry. He became a physician in January 1811 and subsequently served in that capacity with the British troops on the War of 1812.

He moved to Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu where he opened a distillery. He entered politics when elected in William Henry in 1827. He supported the Parti Patriote.

In 1827, he was elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, but he gave up active politics in 1830, without disavowing his reformist allegiance. He became a Patriote leader in the region of the Richelieu River valley, and supported the use of arms at the &quot;Assemblée des Six-Comtés&quot; in 1837.

In a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, Nelson led 5,000 Patriotes in the two-day Assembly of the Six Counties in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada (present-day Quebec), on 23 and 24 October 1837, to protest the government&#x27;s Russell Resolutions, taking place despite the 15 June Proclamation forbidding public assemblies. At one point he interrupted Papineau&#x27;s speech, saying, &quot;As for me, I am of a different opinion from that of M. Papineau. I claim the time has come to melt our spoons to make bullets.&quot; The conference delegates approved the Thirteen Resolutions, based on the republican document &quot;Rights of Man&quot; written by British and later American Revolutionary Thomas Paine, which was also adopted by proponents of both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. A &quot;Column of Liberty&quot; was also erected in Saint-Charles&#x27; Square.
On 16 November 1837, he and 25 others were charged with high treason. Louis-Joseph Papineau and Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan joined Nelson at Saint-Denis at some point before 23 November 1837, where Papineau and O&#x27;Bailey decided to resist arrest and escape to the United States (into Vermont) following the Battle of Saint-Denis.

On 28 February 1838, after having crossed the border from Vermont, Nelson, along with 300 to 400 Patriotes from a secret group called Frères Chasseurs, distributed copies of a declaration of independence written by Nelson&#x27;s brother, Robert Nelson. Inspired by the United States Declaration of Independence, the document listed their grievances with the British colonial government in Lower Canada, and defended their right to overthrow that government.

Later, he led a group of armed citizens who resisted arrest by the authorities at St-Denis. He was arrested soon after. (See Lower Canada Rebellion.) Exiled to Bermuda in 1838, Nelson was granted amnesty by the British colonial government and came back to Montreal in 1842. In 1844, he was elected to the new Parliament of the Province of Canada. In 1854, he became mayor of Montreal, and he died in June 1863. He is interred in the Anglican cemetery in Sorel-Tracy and is commemorated by a park in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough.
