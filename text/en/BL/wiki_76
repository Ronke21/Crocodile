<text>Rickmansworth () is a town in south-west Hertfordshire, England, located approximately north-west of central London, south-west of Watford and inside the perimeter of the M25 motorway. The town is mainly to the north of the Grand Union Canal (formerly the Grand Junction Canal) and the River Colne.

Rickmansworth is the administrative seat of the Three Rivers District Council; the confluence of the River Chess and the River Gade with the Colne in Rickmansworth inspired the district&#x27;s name. The enlarged Colne flows south to form a major tributary of the River Thames. 

The town is served by the Metropolitan line of the London Underground and by Chiltern Railways of the National Rail network, between London Marylebone and Aylesbury.

== Toponymy ==
The name Rickmansworth comes from the Saxon name &quot;Ryckmer&quot;, the local landowner, and &quot;worth&quot; meaning a farm or stockade. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as the Manor of Prichemaresworde. Other spellings include Rykemarwurthe (1119–46), Richemaresworthe (1180), Rykemerewrthe (1248), Richemereworthe (1259), Rikesmareswrth (1287), Rikmansworth (1382), &quot;Rikmeresworth&quot; (1396) and &quot;Rykemerysworth&quot; (1418).

== History ==
There was a settlement in this part of the Colne Valley in the Stone Age. Rickmansworth was one of five manors with which the great Abbey of St Albans had been endowed when founded in 793 by King Offa of Mercia. Local tithes supported the abbey, which provided clergy to serve the people until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. Around the time of the Domesday Book, the population of &quot;Prichemareworth&quot; may have been about 200.

Cardinal Wolsey, in his capacity as Abbot of St Albans, held the Manor of le More in the valley. The manor house was replaced by the hill-top mansion Moor Park, which eventually became the residence of Admiral Lord Anson, who commissioned Capability Brown to remake the formal gardens, and in 1828 of the Barons Ebury; it is now the Golf Club House. The wider area, including Croxley Green, Moor Park, Batchworth, Mill End, West Hyde and Chorleywood, formed the original parish of Rickmansworth.

In 1851, the population had grown to 4,800, and the parish was divided. St Mary&#x27;s Church serves the parish concentrated in the town and extending to Batchworth and parts of Moor Park. The town had a population of 14,571 recorded at the 2001 census.

The three rivers, the Colne, Chess and Gade, provided water for the watercress trade and power for corn milling, silk weaving, paper making and brewing, all long gone. Other industries have included leather-tanning, soft drinks, laundry, straw-plaiting and stocking production. Now, the rivers, canal and flooded gravel pits provide for recreation.

West Mill, a water mill, existed at the time of the Domesday Survey. It was leased to the abbot and convent of St Albans by Ralph Bukberd for a term of years ending in 1539. In 1533, they leased it from the end of this term for twenty-six years to Richard Wilson of Watford. He was to keep in repair the mill and also two millstones, thick, and in breadth. The mill was leased in 1544 to William Hutchinson, yeoman of the spicery, and Janet his wife for their lives. It afterwards came to John Wilson, and was granted in 1576–77 to Richard Master. There was also a water-mill called Batchworth Mill, and a fishery called Blacketts Mill in Rickmansworth. Batchworth Mill was later used as a cotton mill, but was bought in 1820 by John Dickinson &amp; Co., and converted into paper mills, now the site of Affinity Water. Scotsbridge Mill was also productive but is now a restaurant with the unusual feature of a salmon run. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries many of the principal inhabitants were described as &quot;clothiers&quot;, from which it may be inferred that the manufacture of cloth was at one time carried on in the parish, but this industry has long since ceased. There were also silk and flock mills here, described in 1808 as recently built.

A long-running dispute over water levels in the Batchford area, following construction of the Grand Junction Canal, was resolved in 1825, when an obelisk was erected in a pond, to act as a water gauge. It records the agreement made between the canal company, John Dickinson the miller at Batchworth Mill, and R. Williams of Moor Park the landowner.

In July 1860, Lord Ebury obtained powers to construct a single-track railway line, the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (WRR) between Rickmansworth and Watford. Opening in October 1862, Rickmansworth (Church Street) railway station was opposite the parish church of St Mary, with interchange sidings to the Grand Union Canal. The line had stations at Watford Junction and Watford High Street and a depot in Watford. A further Parliamentary authorisation was obtained a year later to construct an extension from Rickmansworth to connect with the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Uxbridge branch, but this was never realised.

Despite hopes that the railway would bring economic development and serve the factories and warehouses that had developed along the Grand Union Canal, it was Watford that grew at a faster pace and drew business from Rickmansworth. The railway was dogged with financial problems and a further Act of Parliament in 1863 authorised the issue of further shares to the value of £30,000 (£40,000 worth had already been issued). The service consisted of five trains each way. The line was worked from the outset by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), which paid the WRR 50% of the gross earnings.

The railway was never financially successful and the Official Receiver was called in four years after opening. The company attempted to remedy its financial problems by opening several freight branches, the most notable being to the Croxley printers and to the Grand Union Canal at Croxley Green. The company was absorbed by the burgeoning LNWR whose station it shared at Watford Junction in 1881.

Rickmansworth grew dramatically during the Victorian era and in the 1920s and 1930s as part of Metro-land, due to the extension of &quot;Metropolitan Railway&quot;, and became a commuter town.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Rickmansworth station is served by passenger services on two lines:
* London to Aylesbury Line, on the National Rail network, from Marylebone station to Aylesbury, via Harrow. Services are operated by Chiltern Railways;
* Metropolitan line trains on the London Underground network. Services operate between Aldgate and Baker Street to Amersham and Chesham.

===Buses===
Local bus services are operated primarily by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex; key routes include:
* 321 Rickmansworth to Watford and Luton
* 335 Watford to Chorleywood
* 336 Watford to Amersham
* 724 Heathrow Airport to Harlow, via St Albans and Ware.

===Roads===
Junctions 17 and 18 of the M25 motorway are within Rickmansworth&#x27;s boundaries, giving access to Heathrow Airport and the national motorway network.

== Politics and economy==
Rickmansworth is a part of the UK Parliament constituency of South West Hertfordshire. Gagan Mohindra has been the Member of Parliament since the December 2019 United Kingdom general election.

The agricultural co-operative, Quality Milk Producers has its headquarters in Scotsbridge House, as do the English Guernsey Cattle Society, the Jersey Cattle Society, the UK Holstein Society, the British Friesian Breeders Club, the Milk Development Council and the Centre for Dairy Information.

== Police station==
In 1897, a police station opened in the High Street adjoining the fire station. The site of the later police station on Rectory Road was purchased by Lidl in 2013 and the building was demolished. The residents association (RDRA) have opposed the proposal for a store. Rickmansworth police station is now located within Three Rivers House.

== Geography ==
Valley Road in Rickmansworth has a frost hollow. This is caused by the local geography, notably the railway embankment which prevents the natural drainage of cold air from a specific part of the valley. The greatest daily temperature range in England was recorded on 29 August 1936 in Rickmansworth when the temperature climbed from 1.1 °C at dawn to 24.9 °C within 9 hours due to this unusual geographic feature.

==Administrative history==
===Parish===
Rickmansworth was an ancient parish. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the parish was included in the Watford Poor Law Union, established in 1835. When sanitary districts were created in 1872, the parish of Rickmansworth therefore became part of the Watford Rural Sanitary District, which in turn became Watford Rural District in December 1894.

===Rickmansworth Urban District (18981974)===
Shortly after Watford Rural District had been created, the process of creating an urban district for the town of Rickmansworth began. An inquiry was held in February 1896 at the Town Hall in Rickmansworth, considering whether to turn the parish into urban district. The initial conclusion was that the whole parish was not appropriate for becoming an urban district, but that an urban district could perhaps be created for just part of it. It was eventually decided to split the parish of Rickmansworth into three parts. The hamlet of Chorleywood was made into a separate parish, whilst the remainder of Rickmansworth parish was split between a Rickmansworth Urban parish (covering the built-up area including Mill End, Rickmansworth and Croxley Green), and a Rickmansworth Rural parish. The Rickmansworth Rural parish was not one contiguous area, but a number of detached pieces of land around the edges of the original parish. The Chorleywood and Rickmansworth Rural parishes remained in the Watford Rural District, whilst the parish of Rickmansworth Urban became Rickmansworth Urban District. These changes all came into force on 15 April 1898. The first meeting of Rickmansworth Urban District Council was held on 16 April 1898 at the Town Hall at 105 High Street in Rickmansworth. William Culley was elected the first chairman of the council.

In 1930, Rickmansworth Urban District Council bought Basing House at 46 High Street in Rickmansworth, which had once been the home of William Penn. The council converted Basing House to become its offices and meeting place, holding its first meeting there in November 1930.

The Rickmansworth Rural parish was abolished in 1935, with most of its area being added to Rickmansworth Urban District and the remainder to the neighbouring parish of Sarratt with effect from 1 April 1935.

Rickmansworth Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 30 October 1953.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, Rickmansworth Urban District was abolished, becoming part of the district of Three Rivers on 1 April 1974.

===After 1974===
No successor parish was created for Rickmansworth in 1974 and so it became an unparished area, governed directly by Three Rivers District Council.

Two parish councils were subsequently created from parts of the former Rickmansworth Urban District. The civil parish of Croxley Green was created on 1 April 1986, covering the eastern part of the former Rickmansworth Urban District and an adjoining area transferred from the parish of Sarratt.

The civil parish of Batchworth was created on 1 April 2017 covering the two Three Rivers district wards of Rickmansworth Town, and Moor Park and Eastbury. The Batchworth parish therefore covers much of Rickmansworth, including the town centre. The Batchworth and Croxley Green parishes do not cover the whole of the former Rickmansworth Urban District, with two areas remaining unparished: one around Maple Cross and Mill End, and another near Loudwater.

== Culture and sport ==

Watersmeet is a 515-seat theatre complex owned by the Three Rivers District Council in the town centre. Its auditorium can be transformed from a raked theatre to a flat floor for performances in the round, dancing, cabaret, weddings, indoor markets and craft fairs. The Rickmansworth Players (affiliated to NODA) is a well-established amateur dramatics society that performs musicals and plays on a regular basis. Rickmansworth Historical Society meets monthly from September to June in the Cloisters Hall.

Rickmansworth is sometimes shortened to &quot;Ricky&quot;, as used in the annual &quot;Ricky Week&quot; celebrations which occur in May. The town&#x27;s canal history is remembered at the end of the week with the Rickmansworth Festival organised by Rickmansworth Waterways Trust. The annual &quot;Ricky Road Run&quot; takes place with more than 500 runners. The annual &quot;Victorian Evening&quot;, held in the town centre at the end of November, was changed to &quot;Starlight Evening&quot; in 2011. Inspired by the reference to Rickmansworth on the first page of The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams: &quot;And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small café in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.&quot;

=== Aquadrome ===

The Aquadrome covers and includes the Aquadrome Local Nature Reserve, Batchworth and Bury Lakes, open grassland, areas of woodland, car parking, a café and a children&#x27;s play area. Its boundaries are the River Colne to the north, the Grand Union Canal to the east and south and Stocker&#x27;s Lake nature reserve to the west. In July 2009, it received a Green Flag Award for parks and open spaces which meet high standards.

The lakes are old gravel quarries filled with water and stocked with fish but only Batchworth Lake is available for fishing. Some gravel from the site was used to build Wembley Stadium in 1923. Batchworth Lake is popular for water skiing events and hosts the Rickmansworth Water Ski Club.

Bury Lake is home to Bury Lake Young Mariners (BLYM); a sailing club and RYA-recognised teaching establishment.

=== Sports clubs ===

Rickmansworth Cricket Club was founded in 1787 and is one of the oldest recorded clubs in England. Its clubhouse was built in 1921 by Sir William Francis Reckitt – a member of the Reckitt and Colman Mustard dynasty. Rickmansworth Sports Club runs five teams in the Saracens Hertfordshire Cricket League. Over the years, other sports clubs have moved into the grounds, including Chess Valley Rugby Football Club and Rickmansworth &amp; Chess Valley Hockey Clubs.
Rickmansworth Golf Course is adjacent to Moor Park golf course.
Rickmansworth Lawn Tennis Club also hosts Rickmansworth table tennis club matches.
Rickmansworth Water Ski Club is located on Batchworth Lake.
Rickmansworth hosts a sub-aqua Club.
The William Penn Leisure Centre has an indoor swimming pool and sports facilities.

=== Media ===
Because of its proximity to London, television signals are received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter, placing Rickmansworth in the BBC London and ITV London areas. 

Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio, Heart Hertfordshire, Tring Radio and Vibe 107.6, a community based station which broadcasts from Watford. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, The Watford Observer.

<text>91 (ninety-one) is the natural number following 90 and preceding 92.

==In mathematics==

91 is:

* the twenty-seventh distinct semiprime and the second of the form (7.q), where q is a higher prime.
* the aliquot sum of 91 is 21; itself a semiprime, within an aliquot sequence of two composite numbers (91, 21, 11, 1, 0) to the prime in the 11-aliquot tree. 91 is the fourth composite number in the 11-aliquot tree. (91, 51, 21, 18).
* the 13th triangular number.
* a hexagonal number, one of the few such numbers to also be a centered hexagonal number.
* a centered nonagonal number.
* a centered cube number.
* a square pyramidal number, being the sum of the squares of the first six integers.
* the smallest positive integer expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways if negative roots are allowed (alternatively the sum of two cubes and the difference of two cubes):&lt;br&gt; . (See 1729 for more details).&lt;br&gt; This implies that 91 is the second cabtaxi number.
* the smallest positive integer expressible as a sum of six distinct squares:&lt;br&gt; .
* The only other ways to write 91 as a sum of distinct squares are:&lt;br&gt; and
* the smallest pseudoprime satisfying the congruence .
* a repdigit in base 9 (1119).
* palindromic in bases 3 (101013), 9 (1119), and 12 (7712).
* a Riordan number.
* the smallest number that looks prime but is not, proven using the Rotten Theorem by John Conway.

The decimal equivalent of the fraction can be obtained by using powers of 9.

==In science==
* McCarthy 91 function, a recursive function in discrete mathematics

<text>92 (ninety-two) is the natural number following 91 and preceding 93

== In mathematics==
=== Form ===
92 is a composite number of the general form &quot;p&quot;2&quot;q&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is a higher prime (23). It is the tenth of this form and the eighth of the form 22&quot;q&quot;.

=== Properties ===
There are 92 &quot;atomic elements&quot; in John Conway&#x27;s look-and-say sequence, corresponding to the 92 non-transuranic elements in the chemist&#x27;s periodic table.

==== Solids ====

The most faces or vertices an Archimedean or Catalan solid can have is 92: the snub dodecahedron has 92 faces while its dual polyhedron, the pentagonal hexecontahedron, has 92 vertices. On the other hand, as a simple polyhedron, the final stellation of the icosahedron has 92 vertices.

There are 92 Johnson solids.

==== Abstract algebra ====

92 is the total number of objects that are permuted by the series of five finite, simple Mathieu groups formula_1 (collectively), as defined by permutations based on elements formula_2. Half of 92 is 46 (the largest even number that is not the sum of two abundant numbers), which is the number of maximal subgroups of the friendly giant formula_3, the largest &quot;sporadic&quot; finite simple group.

=== In different bases ===
92 is palindromic in other bases, where it is represented as 2326, 1617, 4422, and 2245.

There are 92 numbers formula_4 such that formula_5 does not contain all digits in base ten (the largest such number is 168, where 68 is the smallest number with such a representation containing all digits, followed by 70 and 79).

== In other fields ==
Ninety-two is also:
* The number which runs through almost every single of British film-maker Peter Greenaway&#x27;s films. This number has special association with the fictional character of Greenaway&#x27;s creation, Tulse Luper. It is said the number itself is based on a mathematical error in calculations concerning John Cage&#x27;s work Indeterminacy. See &quot;The Falls&quot; for extensive use of this number.

* the 28th distinct semiprime and the 9th of the form (3.q) where q is a higher prime.
* the first number in the 3rd triplet of consecutive semiprimes, 93, 94, 95.
* with an aliquot sum of 35; itself a semiprime, within an aliquot sequence (93,35,13,1,0) of three numbers to the Prime 13 in the 13-Aliquot tree.
* a Blum integer, since its two prime factors, 3 and 31 are both Gaussian primes.
* a repdigit in base 5 (3335), and 30 (3330).
* palindromic in bases 2, 5, and 30.
* a lucky number.
* a cake number.
* an idoneal number.

There are 93 different cyclic Gilbreath permutations on 11 elements, and therefore there are 93 different real periodic points of order 11 on the Mandelbrot set.

<text>94 (ninety-four) is the natural number following 93 and preceding 95.

==In mathematics==
94 is:

*the twenty-ninth distinct semiprime and the fourteenth of the form (2.q).
*the ninth composite number in the 43-aliquot tree. The aliquot sum of 94 is 50 within the aliquot sequence; (94,50,43,1,0).
*the second number in the third triplet of three consecutive distinct semiprimes, 93, 94 and 95
*a 17-gonal number and a nontotient.
*an Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 94 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.
*a Smith number in decimal.

== In computing ==
The ASCII character set (and, more generally, ISO 646) contains exactly 94 graphic non-whitespace characters, which form a contiguous range of code points. These codes (0x21–0x7E, as corresponding high bit set bytes 0xA1–0xFE) also used in various multi-byte encoding schemes for languages of East Asia, such as ISO 2022, EUC and GB 2312. For this reason, code pages of 942 and even 943 code points were common in East Asia in 1980s–1990s.

==In other fields==
Ninety-four is:
*Used as a nonsense number by the British satire magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Most commonly used in spoof articles end halfway through a sentence with &quot;(continued p. 94)&quot;. The magazine never extends to 94 pages: this was originally a reference to the enormous size of some Sunday newspapers.

<text>Phillip Christopher Jupitus (, &quot;né&quot; Swan; born 25 June 1962) is a retired English stand-up and improv comedian, actor, performance poet, cartoonist and podcaster. Jupitus was a team captain on all but one BBC Two-broadcast episode of music quiz &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; from its inception in 1996 until 2015, and also appeared regularly as a guest on several other panel shows, including &quot;QI&quot; and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

From around 2018, Jupitus retired from performing and studied art at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp; Design in Dundee.

==Early life==

Born Phillip Swan in Newport on the Isle of Wight, he took his stepfather Alexander&#x27;s surname Jupitus (a corruption of the Lithuanian name Šeputis) when he was 16. Jupitus attended a comprehensive school before winning a place at the boys&#x27; grammar boarding school Woolverstone Hall School near Ipswich.

==Career==

Jupitus worked in Essex at the Manpower Services Commission, part of the Department of Employment, for five years, while he also wrote political poetry and drew cartoons. He resigned from the department in 1984, hoping for a career in the music industry.

Using the moniker &quot;Porky the Poet&quot;, Jupitus became associated with Anti-Fascist Action and the ranting poetry scene, alongside Seething Wells and Attila the Stockbroker. Jupitus approached local bands to offer himself as a support act for their tours: &quot;I thought it looked easy, I was very cheap. If you got another band to support you, there are probably four of them and roadies and managers. But me—I just turned up and read poems.&quot; His first vinyl recordings were part of the live Newtown Neurotics album &quot;Kickstarting a Backfiring Nation&quot; as Porky the Poet in 1987.

Jupitus toured colleges, universities and student unions, supporting bands such as Billy Bragg, the Style Council and The Housemartins. He supported Billy Bragg once more on the Labour Party-sponsored Red Wedge tour in 1985: &quot;In the early &#x27;80s, I got involved with Red Wedge, in which Neil Kinnock got various bands to stage concerts for Labour. The reason I got involved was 20% because I believed in the cause, 30% because I loved Billy Bragg, and 50% because I wanted to meet Paul Weller&quot;.

After Red Wedge, he found it difficult to get other bookings, due to the decline of political poetry as a mainstream art. He got a job as a runner for the independent record label Go! Discs, which had signed Billy Bragg and other bands, such as the Housemartins. Bragg said: &quot;We ended up managing to get him a job at Go! Discs, which was brilliant. I was concerned that the cut-throat nature of the record business would make him jaded—underneath that rhino exterior there is quite a sensitive person—but that was before I realised that he was going to come back and do gigs again. Working at Go! Discs got his confidence up.&quot;

His performances of two of his poems, &quot;Beano&quot; and &quot;Nobby&quot;, were included in the 1986 album &quot;Not Just Mandela&quot;, alongside tracks by Bragg and Attila the Stockbroker, amongst others. Released on Davy Lamp Records, all proceeds of the record were going to the Anti-Apartheid Movement.

Jupitus became press officer and compère for The Housemartins (appearing in the 1986 music video for &quot;Happy Hour&quot;), using the role to continue being in front of an audience, while also filling support slots for other artists. During this time, he worked as a warm-up act on the Channel 4 TV show &quot;The Show&quot;. He quit working for Go! Discs in 1989 and fell back on his poetry and competing to try to gain a foothold on the London comedy circuit.

He conceived and directed the Brit Awards-nominated music video for Bragg&#x27;s &quot;Sexuality&quot; in 1991 and wrote a parody version of that song about bestiality. He also appeared alongside R.E.M. in the music video for Bragg&#x27;s &quot;You Woke Up My Neighbourhood&quot; and performed in &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Hope Not Hate&quot; campaign tour with Bragg. He has also appeared numerous times at the Glastonbury Festival as a DJ and a compere in The Left Field tent. Jupitus produced the music video for Kirsty MacColl&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; from the album &quot;Electric Landlady&quot;. He appeared at her tribute concert in 2002 as compere, and also sang one of her songs, &quot;Fifteen Minutes&quot;.

In 2000, he released the stand-up comedy DVD &quot;Phill Jupitus Live: Quadrophobia&quot;. In 2001, he appeared as a sports journalist in the film &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;.

Jupitus made a guest appearance on the &quot;Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band&quot; 40th anniversary DVD performing with the band on the tracks &quot;Mr. Apollo&quot; and &quot;Canyons of Your Mind&quot;, and has toured with them around the UK. He appears on the Bonzos&#x27; 2007 album, &quot;Pour l&#x27;Amour des Chiens&quot;. Also in 2007, he performed with The Blockheads on their 30th anniversary tour. He continued to perform with them sporadically since Ian Dury&#x27;s death, also appearing in Dury&#x27;s place for &quot;Drip Fed Fred&quot; during the Madness concert at Wembley Arena shortly before Dury&#x27;s death. Jupitus performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2008.

On 13–14 February 2009, Jupitus co-hosted the first BadMovieClub on Twitter. At midnight, over 2,000 Twitter users simultaneously pressed &#x27;Play&#x27; on the film &quot;The Happening&quot; and continued to tweet whilst watching, creating a collective viewing experience that generated 40,000 tweets in under two hours. The first showing took place at 9:00pm, hosted by Graham Linehan.
Jupitus was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Essex in South Essex College&#x27;s congregation ceremony in Southend on 30 September 2010. Jupitus was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Kent, Canterbury in 2017, where his daughters had previously attended.

On 6 October 2010, Jupitus, along with Emma Kennedy, hosted a special comedy evening at the Canterbury Animation Festival &#x27;Anifest&#x27;.

Jupitus attended the &quot;I Do To Equal Marriage&quot; event which celebrated the introduction of same-sex marriage in England and Wales in March 2014.

===Radio===
Jupitus began hosting his own radio show on BBC GLR in 1995, a regular job that would last until 2000.
After that, he embarked on his first stand-up comedy tour of the UK, &quot;Jedi, Steady, Go&quot;, performing the &quot;Star Wars&quot; story in a comedic fashion.

In 2002, Phill Jupitus was a stand-in presenter on BBC Radio 2 for Steve Wright while he was away on holiday.

Jupitus was the breakfast DJ on BBC Radio 6 Music from 2002 until 30 March 2007 (the last song played, by listener request, was &quot;Broadway&quot; by The Clash), and made brief returns to the station during the summer of 2007, sitting in for Stephen Merchant on Sunday afternoon and Liz Kershaw on Saturday mornings. In 2010, he publicly criticised the BBC&#x27;s announcement that it was to discontinue the station, describing the decision as &quot;not only an act of cultural vandalism, it&#x27;s also an affront to the memory of John Peel and a slap in the face to thousands of licence-payers.&quot; Jupitus has since written a book about his time on 6 Music, entitled &quot;Good Morning Nantwich: Adventures in Breakfast Radio&quot;. In February 2010, as part of his research for the book, Jupitus presented the breakfast show for one week on Bournemouth University student radio station, Nerve Radio, produced by Mog McIntyre and co-presented by regular student presenters Guy Larsen and Jess Bracey.

On 9 September 2009, Jupitus narrated a half-hour documentary on BBC Radio 4 about the comic strip &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; created by Bill Watterson.

Jupitus has worked on Radio 4 as a regular contributor to &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, &quot;The News Quiz&quot; (where his performances are notable for a range of parody voices), &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. He also presented &quot;Best Sellers&quot;—a series on the life and work of Peter Sellers—and wrote and presented &quot;Disneyfied&quot;, a documentary on the work of Walt Disney. On 7 June 2020 he presented Pick of the Week.

Jupitus has also appeared in several episodes of the Radio 4 show &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; and is a regular guest with the Comedy Store Players.

===Television===
Jupitus was one of the panellists on the first TV episode of the show &quot;Loose Talk&quot;, which made a brief transition from radio to television in 1994. In 1996, he joined BBC Two&#x27;s pop quiz show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; as a regular team captain – having appeared in every single episode of the original run, except for series 25, episode 6. He was a frequent guest panellist on &quot;QI&quot; from 2003 until 2020, while his daughter, Emily Jupitus, later started working on the show as a researcher (or &#x27;QI Elf&#x27;). He had a history of mimicking the &quot;QI&quot; host, Stephen Fry, while on the show. In December 1999, he had the lead role in &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, an ITV sitcom parodying preparations (and fears) for the year 2000, set in Essex in the year 999. Jupitus has played Councillor Cowdrey in CITV children&#x27;s series &quot;Bottom Knocker Street&quot; since its first series in summer 2013.

Jupitus has presented several editions of the popular &quot;Top Ten&quot; series for Channel 4, while also joining another comedy panel game—&quot;It&#x27;s Only TV...but I Like It&quot;—as a team captain, alongside Jonathan Ross and Julian Clary.

He has made one appearance in an episode of &quot;Holby City&quot; as a patient (in &quot;Men are from Mars&quot;). As a voice actor he has provided the voices for Dandelion in an ITV adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; and also performing a selection of voices for &quot;Rex the Runt&quot; by Aardman Animations.

Jupitus is a continuity announcer for the UKTV channel Dave during the channel&#x27;s evening schedule. During 2008, he did the voice over work for the Dave show &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot;. He also took part in the Dave show Comedy Exchange, where he went to America, while &quot;Eugene Mirman&quot; came to Britain. Here they each performed different routines in various events. He has appeared in &quot;Argumental&quot; for the same channel, where team captain Marcus Brigstocke made him laugh so hard he fell off his chair and took a long time to recover. Jupitus and Brigstocke were reunited on the Radio 4 show (hosted by Brigstocke) &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen Star Wars&quot;, in which Jupitus tried out things that he&#x27;d never attempted before, such as eating a Findus Crispy Pancake, undergoing a colonic irrigation, and shaving another person&#x27;s head.

During the 2008 Major League Baseball season, Jupitus presented a feature during the seventh inning stretch of Channel Five&#x27;s featured Sunday night game. Each week he would read a section or quote from one of his favourite baseball-related books. He is a fan of the Boston Red Sox and has their logo tattooed on his arm.

In December 2008, Jupitus took part as a guest presenter on RTÉ&#x27;s comical topical discussion show &quot;The Panel&quot;.

===Theatre===
Jupitus co-wrote and starred in the play &quot;Waiting for Alice&quot; with Andre Vincent which had a run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The premiere took place on 16 July 2007 at the St. Ives Theatre in St Ives, Cornwall.

Jupitus and Marcus Brigstocke appeared together in the UK tour of &quot;Totally Looped&quot;, performing at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, the Kings Theatre, Southsea and the Victoria Hall, Stoke-on-Trent in spring 2009.

In October 2009, Jupitus joined the West End theatre cast of &quot;Hairspray&quot;, playing the role of Edna Turnblad at the Shaftesbury Theatre. He joined the 2011 tour of &quot;Spamalot&quot;, playing the role of King Arthur.

On 16 January 2015, Jupitus was confirmed as starring opposite Jason Manford in the 2015 tour of Mel Brooks&#x27; musical &quot;The Producers&quot;, portraying Franz Liebkind. He has since appeared in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; also alongside Jason Manford on a tour of the UK.

===Podcasts===
From August 2008 he was the host of &quot;The Times&quot; football podcast &quot;The Game&quot;, replacing the previous co-hosts Gabriele Marcotti and Guillem Balagué, although Marcotti was still a regular pundit on the show and hosted again on Jupitus&#x27; departure.

Between September 2008 and June 2011, Jupitus produced a podcast along with Phil Wilding, who produced his BBC 6Music show, called &quot;Phill and Phil&#x27;s Perfect Ten&quot;. Initially being released fortnightly, it later became more sporadic due to the pair&#x27;s work commitments. In April 2009, archive episodes were made available for purchase on Audible and iTunes as audiobook bundles of four with bonus &#x27;perfect ones&#x27; attached. Since ending the podcast in June 2011 the pair have indicated that all back-episodes will be released free at some point in the future.

In 2018 Jupitus was interviewed by Jodie Cook for the Clever Tykes podcast: Creating Useful People. The podcast explores the childhood influences that shape future success. In Jupitus&#x27; episode he talked about how he developed his ethos for life and work, as well as his mum&#x27;s dreams for him as a naval merchant.

=== Art ===
Early in his career Jupitus drew cartoons which appeared in the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;Radio Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian.&quot; In 2019 he started studying a degree in fine art at the Duncan of Jordanstone School of Art, Dundee University. He has also curated collections for the Art UK website. He wrote the foreword for the book &quot;Leigh Art&quot; in which he reminisces about childhood visits to Leigh-on-Sea and his enjoyment for the annual Leigh Art Trail.

==Personal life==

Jupitus is married with two children and lives in Fife. His daughter Emily is an &quot;Elf&quot; (researcher and writer) for the game show &quot;QI&quot;.

He is a fan of West Ham United football club and the Boston Red Sox.

Jupitus discussed his arachnophobia with the writer and broadcaster Suzy Klein on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;I&#x27;m Suzy, and I&#x27;m a Phobic&quot;, which was broadcast in January 2013.

Jupitus is also a keen apiarist, winning several prizes at the National Honey Show 2002.

<text>96 (ninety-six) is the natural number following 95 and preceding 97. It is a number that appears the same when turned upside down.

==In mathematics==

96 is:

* an octagonal number.
* a refactorable number.
* an untouchable number.
* a semiperfect number since it is a multiple of 6.
* an abundant number since the sum of its proper divisors is greater than 96.
* the fourth Granville number and the second non-perfect Granville number. The next Granville number is 126, the previous being 24.
* the sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;x&quot;) over the first seventeen integers.
* strobogrammatic in bases 10 (9610), 11 (8811) and 95 (1195).
* palindromic in bases 11 (8811), 15 (6615), 23 (4423), 31 (3331), 47 (2247) and 95 (1195).
* an Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 96 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.
* divisible by the number of prime numbers (24) below 96.
* the smallest natural number that can be expressed as the difference of two nonzero squares in more than three ways: formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 or formula_4.

The number of divisors of 96 is 12. As no smaller number has more than 12 divisors, 96 is a largely composite number.

Skilling&#x27;s figure, a degenerate uniform polyhedron, has a Euler characteristic formula_5

Every integer greater than 96 may be represented as a sum of distinct super-prime numbers.

<doc id="407351" wikidata="Q1347393" url="?curid=407351" title="Rushmore (film)">
<text>Rushmore is a 1998 American comedy film directed by Wes Anderson about a teenager named Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman in his film debut), his friendship with rich industrialist Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and their shared affection for elementary school teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). The film was co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson. The soundtrack features multiple songs by bands associated with the British Invasion of the 1960s. Filming began in November 1997 around Houston, Texas, and lasted 50 days, until late January 1998.

While the box office results were modest, the film had a positive reception among film critics. The film helped launch Schwartzman&#x27;s career while establishing a &quot;second career&quot; for Murray as a respected actor in independent cinema. At the 1999 Independent Spirit Awards, Anderson won the Best Director award and Murray won Best Supporting Male award. Murray also earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. Starting from &quot;Rushmore&quot;, both Murray and Schwartzman became two of Anderson&#x27;s most frequent collaborators, appearing in eight and six subsequent films, respectively. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Eccentric 15-year-old scholarship student Max Fischer participates extensively in extracurricular activities at the prestigious Rushmore Academy in Houston, but struggles academically. Max&#x27;s middle-class background, which contrasts with the wealthy and privileged lives of most Rushmore students, feeds his determination to make his name known. Headmaster Nelson Guggenheim places him on &quot;sudden death academic probation&quot;, warning him that if he fails one more class, he will be expelled. At a school assembly, Max meets Herman Blume, a disillusioned parent and local industrialist who despises his twin sons Ronny and Donny, both students at Rushmore. Blume befriends Max and takes him under his wing.

Upon reading an intriguing written message left in a book he read in the library, Max tracks down the book&#x27;s previous borrower, Rosemary Cross, a widowed first-grade teacher at Rushmore, and soon becomes obsessed with her. Attempting to woo her, he successfully petitions to have the Latin curriculum kept at Rushmore, and later confesses his love for her; she rejects his affection due to their age difference. Rosemary and others, including Max&#x27;s younger friend Dirk Calloway, are impressed by Max&#x27;s tenacity, while other students, including the brash and aggressive Magnus Buchan, resent Max&#x27;s ability to manipulate authority, seemingly on a whim, to the point where the entire school body is affected. Max then attempts to court Rosemary by building an aquarium on the school&#x27;s baseball field, noting her interest in marine life due to the fish tanks in her classroom and the library book by Jacques Cousteau they had both read, but is stopped by Guggenheim at the ground-breaking ceremony and subsequently expelled from Rushmore for having never sought the school&#x27;s approval for the project.

Afterward, Max enrolls at Grover Cleveland High School, a local public school. Classmate Margaret Yang shows interest in him, but he ignores her. Eventually, Max begins to settle in and participate in extracurricular activities again, with Rosemary and Blume supporting him. Blume encourages him to give up pursuing Rosemary but eventually becomes attracted to her himself, and they begin to see each other behind Max&#x27;s back.

Eventually, Dirk discovers the relationship between Rosemary and Blume and informs him as payback for a rumor Max started about his mother. Max confronts Blume, declaring their friendship over, and they soon begin scrapping. Max informs Blume&#x27;s wife of her husband&#x27;s affair, forcing him to move into a hotel. Then he puts bees in Blume&#x27;s room, leading to his running over Max&#x27;s bicycle with his car. Max is eventually arrested for cutting the brake lines on Blume&#x27;s car. He later attempts to get revenge on Rosemary by taking damaging photos of her and Blume together but learns from Guggenheim that she had already resigned.

Max eventually gives up, meeting Blume at the grave of his mother, Eloise, who died of cancer when Max was seven years old. He explains that revenge no longer matters because even if he wins, Rosemary would still love Blume. Max becomes reclusive and begins to skip school to work at his father, Bert&#x27;s, barbershop. One day, Dirk stops by the shop to apologize, bringing him a Christmas present. He then reveals to Max that Guggenheim suffered a stroke and suggests he visit him at the hospital, knowing Blume will also be there. Max and a washed-up Blume meet and are courteous. Blume tells him that Rosemary broke up with him because she&#x27;s still in love with her dead husband Edward Appleby, a former Rushmore student, whose death the previous year directly influenced her decision to teach there. Max eventually returns to school and begins to improve his grades.

Taking his final shot at Rosemary, Max pretends to be injured in a car accident, but she sees through his ruse and rebuffs him again. He then decides to help Blume and Rosemary reconcile, first by inviting her to another aquarium groundbreaking ceremony, but she does not show up. Max then invites both of them to attend his Vietnam War-themed play at Grover Cleveland. The performance touches Blume, himself a Vietnam veteran, and he and Rosemary later appear to reconcile. At the after-play party, Max reveals to Blume and Rosemary that he and Margaret are dating. Max and Rosemary then share a dance together.

==Production==
With &quot;Rushmore&quot;, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson wanted to create their own &quot;slightly heightened reality, like a Roald Dahl children&#x27;s book&quot;. Like Max Fischer, Wilson was expelled from his preparatory school, St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas, in the tenth grade. He also shared Max&#x27;s ambition, lack of academic motivation, and crush on an older woman. Anderson and Wilson began writing the screenplay for &quot;Rushmore&quot; years before they made &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;. They knew that they wanted to make a film set in an elite preparatory school, much like St. Mark&#x27;s, which Owen had attended along with his two brothers, Andrew and Luke (Luke being the sole graduate), and St. John&#x27;s School in Houston, Texas which Anderson had attended. The film featured M. B. Lamar High School. According to the director, &quot;One of the things that was most appealing to us was the initial idea of a 15-year-old kid and a 50-year-old man becoming friends and equals&quot;. &quot;Rushmore&quot; was originally going to be made for New Line Cinema but when they could not agree on a budget, Anderson, Wilson and producer Barry Mendel held an auction for the film rights in mid-1997 and struck a deal with Joe Roth, then-chair of Walt Disney Studios. He offered them a $10million budget. The film was distributed by Touchstone Pictures, and produced by Barry Mendel and Paul Schiff for American Empirical Pictures.

===Casting===
Anderson and Wilson wrote the role of Mr. Blume with Bill Murray in mind but doubted they could get the script to him. Murray&#x27;s agent was a fan of Anderson&#x27;s first film, &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;, and urged the actor to read the script for &quot;Rushmore&quot;. Murray liked it so much that he agreed to work for scale, which Anderson estimated to be around $9,000. The actor was drawn to Anderson and Wilson&#x27;s &quot;precise&quot; writing and felt that a lot of the film was about &quot;the struggle to retain civility and kindness in the face of extraordinary pain. And I&#x27;ve felt a lot of that in my life&quot;. Anderson created detailed storyboards for each scene but was open to Murray&#x27;s knack for improvisation.

Cast directors considered 1,800 teenagers from the United States, Canada, and Britain for the role of Max Fischer before finding Jason Schwartzman. Macaulay Culkin was considered for the role. In October 1997, approximately a month before principal photography was to begin, a casting director for the film met the seventeen-year-old actor at a party thanks to Schwartzman&#x27;s cousin, film-maker Sofia Coppola. He came to his audition wearing a preparatory-school blazer and a self-made Rushmore patch. Anderson almost did not make the film when he could not find an actor to play Max but felt that Schwartzman &quot;could retain audience loyalty despite doing all the crummy things Max had to do&quot;. Anderson originally pictured Max, physically, as Mick Jagger at age 15, to be played by an actor like Noah Taylor in the Australian film &quot;Flirting—&quot;&quot;a pale, skinny kid&quot;. When Anderson met Schwartzman, he reminded Anderson much more of Dustin Hoffman and decided to go that way with the character. Anderson and the actor spent weeks together talking about the character, working on hand gestures and body language.

Seymour Cassel stars as Bert Fischer, Max&#x27;s dad. Brian Cox stars as Dr. Nelson Guggenheim, the school&#x27;s headmaster. Mason Gamble plays Dirk Calloway, Max&#x27;s friend. Sara Tanaka plays Margaret Yang, the girl who has a crush on Max. Alexis Bledel is an extra as a Grover Cleveland High School student.

===Principal photography===

Filming began in November 1997 and lasted for 50 days, until late January 1998. On the first day of principal photography, Anderson delivered his directions to Murray in a whisper so that he would not be embarrassed if the actor shot him down. However, the actor publicly deferred to Anderson, hauled equipment, and when Disney denied the director a $75,000 shot of Max and Mr. Blume riding in a helicopter, Murray gave Anderson a blank check to cover the cost, although ultimately, the scene was never shot.

At one point, Anderson toyed with the idea of shooting the private school scenes in England and the public school scenes in Detroit in order to &quot;get the most extreme variation possible,&quot; according to the director. Instead, the film was shot in and around Houston, Texas where Anderson grew up. His high school alma mater, St. John&#x27;s School, was used for the picturesque setting of Rushmore Academy. Lamar High School in Houston was used to depict Grover Cleveland High School, the public school. In real life, the two schools are across the street from each other. Richard Connelly of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that the Lamar building &quot;was ghetto&#x27;d up to look like a dilapidated inner-city school.&quot; Many scenes were also filmed at North Shore High School. The film&#x27;s widescreen, slightly theatrical look was influenced by Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Anderson also cites &quot;The Graduate&quot; and &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; as cinematic influences on &quot;Rushmore&quot;.

Initially, the character of Margaret Yang was supposed to have a wooden finger, having been blown off in a science experiment. The idea was abandoned, but later on used in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, where Margot has a wooden finger.

=== Cinematography ===
&quot;Rushmore&quot; uses the unique style of cinematography that Wes Anderson has become well known for. The film has a singular sense of colour, focusing mainly on blues, greens, and reds in order to create a heightened reality. The montage sequence near the beginning of the film is strongly influenced by the rapid transitions used by French New Wave film-makers. The shot of Max in the go-kart also resembles a photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue. Disney executives almost cancelled the montage sequence as they did not believe that these short singular shots were necessary due to the film&#x27;s restrictive budget and time frame. Therefore, the sequence was shot quickly whenever the crew were at a suitable location.

== Themes ==
Anderson confirmed that the protagonist Max is a semi-autobiographical version of himself, including his tendency to write school plays, except that Max is not shy. Anderson has come to be known as an auteur for this distinct style and frequent collaborations with the same actors and production members. Devin Orgeron claims that Anderson&#x27;s auteurship is interesting in his consistent &quot;cinematic and extracinematic confrontation with the very question of auteurship&quot;. In Anderson&#x27;s films, and especially &quot;Rushmore,&quot; the protagonist is a &quot;flawed but ultimately redeemable&quot; auteur. However, in both the protagonists&#x27; and Anderson&#x27;s ties to their communities, an idea of &quot;&quot;collective&quot; auteurship&quot; is proffered.

Mark Olsen writes that Anderson observes his characters chasing &quot;their miniaturist renditions of the American Dream&quot; and that &quot;they embody both sides of William Carlos Williams&#x27; famous edict that the pure products of America go crazy&quot;.

Deborah J. Thomas argues that &quot;Rushmore&quot; has a certain level of deliberate artifice. She observes a tension between irony and affect, and the clash &quot;between these aesthetic modes destabilises normative assumptions and expectations in relation to character engagement.&quot; For her Anderson uses a &quot;series of strategies in relation to framing, camera angles, shot scales, sound and performance that are designed to unsettle the audience&#x27;s experience of proximity to, and hence intimacy with, the characters&quot;.

In the film, Anderson frequently employs the visual device of a stage, or stage curtains, to present the action. Rachel Joseph speculates that there is a link between these &quot;screened stages&quot; and the theme of mourning, for this &quot;framed theatricality ... parallels the grieving process of reenacting and repeating the traumatic&quot;. She also draws a connection between this style of presentation and the &quot;cinema of attractions&quot; that Tom Gunning theorised.

==Soundtrack==
Wes Anderson originally intended for the film&#x27;s soundtrack to be entirely made up of songs by the Kinks, feeling the music suited Max&#x27;s loud and angry nature and because Max was initially envisioned to be a British exchange student. However, while Anderson listened to a compilation of other British Invasion songs on the set, the soundtrack gradually evolved until only one song by the Kinks remained in the film (&quot;Nothin&#x27; in the World Can Stop Me Worryin&#x27; &#x27;Bout That Girl&quot;). According to Anderson, &quot;Max always wears a blazer and the British Invasion sounds like music made by guys in blazers, but still rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. In his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Rob Brunner gave the soundtrack record an &quot;A−&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;this collection won&#x27;t make much sense if you haven&#x27;t seen the movie. But for anyone who left the theater singing along to the Faces&#x27; &quot;Ooh La La&quot;, it&#x27;s an essential soundtrack&quot;. Anderson also pays homage to the Charles Schulz/Bill Melendez Peanuts television specials, playing &quot;Hark The Herald Angels Sing&quot; from the famous &quot;Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; in one of the film&#x27;s scenes.

Its domestic total gross was $17,105,219, and its international box office was $1,975,216.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 107 reviews and an average rating of 8.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;This cult favorite is a quirky coming of age story, with fine, off-kilter performances from Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In his review for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, film critic Dave Kehr praised &quot;Rushmore&quot; as &quot;a magnificent work&quot; and picked it as the best movie of the year. &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that Bill Murray was &quot;at his off-kilter best&quot;. Todd McCarthy, in his review for &quot;Variety&quot;, admired the film&#x27;s deep-focus widescreen compositions, and felt that it gave the story &quot;exceptional vividness&quot;. In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Schickel praised &quot;Rushmore&quot; as a &quot;delightfully droll comedy&quot;, but felt it indulges in itself a little too much. He observed the film brought up &quot;many dark and weighty emotional objects&quot;, and tried to conclude them in a &quot;satisfying way&quot;.

In her review for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote that Anderson is smart enough to avoid turning sentimental, observing how Max &quot;starts off on top of the Rushmore world and experiences a wonderfully welcome comeuppance&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Anthony Quinn thought &quot;Rushmore&quot; was different than all the many &quot;high-school flicks every week&quot;, describing it as a &quot;adolescent tragi-comedy, neurotic-romantic triangle&quot; and a &quot;study in loss and loneliness&quot;. He praised Schwartzman for playing a character who has not emotionally matured yet, and thought Murray gave an &quot;emotional turnaround&quot; performance. In her review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley praised Schwartzman&#x27;s performance for winning &quot;sympathy and a great deal of affection for Max, never mind that he could grow into Sidney Blumenthal&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Rushmore&quot; an &quot;A&quot; rating and opined that Anderson used the 1960s British Invasion hits to &quot;further define Max&#x27;s adolescent dislocation&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, wrote that Anderson and Wilson do not &quot;share the class snobbery&quot; in much of Salinger&#x27;s work, but still thought that they &quot;harbor a protective gallantry toward their characters&quot; which is, at the same time, the film&#x27;s greatest strength and weakness.

In &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston called it one of the year&#x27;s finest films and thought it reminds him of &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; but also added that the &quot;complexity of Max and the audacity of the film&#x27;s set pieces place it in a league of its own.&quot; Film critic David Ansen ranked &quot;Rushmore&quot; the 10th best film of 1998.

Some critics did not review the film as positively. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan criticized Max&#x27;s overtly &quot;snooty&quot; personality as &quot;too off-putting to tolerate&quot;, which could potentially discourage audiences when identifying with the film. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four citing an issue with the film&#x27;s shift in tone in the final act, stating &quot;the air goes out of the movie&quot; in regards to &quot;stage-setting and character development&quot;. He further wrote that the film is torn between being structured like a comedy and having &quot;undertones of darker themes&quot;, remarking that he wished the film had &quot;allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows&quot;.

A lifelong fan of film critic Pauline Kael, Anderson arranged a private screening of &quot;Rushmore&quot; for the retired writer. Afterwards, she told him, &quot;I genuinely don&#x27;t know what to make of this movie&quot;. It was a nerve-wracking experience for Anderson but Kael did like the film and told others to see it. Anderson and Jason Schwartzman traveled from Los Angeles to New York City and back on a touring bus to promote the film. The tour started on January 21, 1999, and went through 11 cities in the United States.

===Legacy and accolades===
&quot;Rushmore&quot; won two Independent Spirit Awards: Wes Anderson for Best Director, and Bill Murray for Best Supporting Actor. Murray was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category for the Golden Globes.

The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named Bill Murray Best Supporting Actor of the year for his performance in &quot;Rushmore&quot;. Wes Anderson was named the New Generation honoree. The National Society of Film Critics also named Murray as Best Supporting Actor of the year as did the New York Film Critics.

&quot;Rushmore&quot; is on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. The film was also ranked on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since &#x27;83&quot; list and ranked it on their Top 25 Modern Romances list. &quot;Spin&quot; hailed the film as &quot;the best comedy of the year&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; also named it the 175th greatest film of all time in 2008. Four years later, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Rushmore&quot; on its list of the 100 Best Films of the 1990s, and it was ranked the decade&#x27;s ninth best film in two polls – one for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and the other for &quot;Paste&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; included it among the 50 best movies of the 1990s, calling it Anderson&#x27;s &quot;most perfectly imagined film&quot;.

&quot;ShortList&quot; included the film on their list of &quot;The 30 Coolest Films Ever&quot;. Ryan Gilbey of &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed it as the eighth best comedy film ever made. In November 2015, the film was ranked the 39th funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of &quot;101 Funniest Screenplays&quot;.

Murray&#x27;s career experienced a renaissance after the film, and he established himself as an actor in independent film.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<doc id="407353" wikidata="Q3082743" url="?curid=407353" title="Frank Muir">
<text>Frank Herbert Muir (5 February 1920 – 2 January 1998) was an English comedy writer, radio and television personality, and raconteur. His writing and performing partnership with Denis Norden endured for most of their careers. Together they wrote BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Take It from Here&quot; for over 10 years, and then appeared on BBC radio quizzes &quot;My Word!&quot; and &quot;My Music&quot; for another 35. Muir became Assistant Head of Light Entertainment at the BBC in the 1960s, and was then London Weekend Television&#x27;s founding Head of Entertainment. His many writing credits include editorship of &quot;The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose,&quot; as well as the &quot;What-a-Mess&quot; books that were later turned into an animated TV series.

==Birth and early life==
Muir was the second son of steam tug engineer Charles James Muir (1888–1934), originally from New Zealand, and his wife Margaret, daughter of ship&#x27;s carpenter Harry Harding. Harry Harding had died young at sea; his widow, Elizabeth Jane (née Cowie) subsequently married Frank Herbert Webber, a former lighthouse inspector and licensee of the Derby Arms Hotel and pub at Ramsgate, Kent. The pub was operated by his widow for 22 years after Webber&#x27;s death. Muir was born in the pub, and spent part of his childhood in Leyton, London. Charles Muir left his seafaring occupation after marrying, and took up unskilled work such as extending Ramsgate&#x27;s railway and loading stores onto naval vessels; he finally took a job with a firm at Leyton, supervising their machinery, and died of pneumonia when Frank Muir was a schoolboy. Margaret Muir ran a small sweet-shop across the road from the Derby Arms.

His aunt was Rose Muir (d. 1970), MBE; she and her brother were orphaned at a young age, and when he went to sea she had remained in New Zealand and taken a low-status position at Christchurch Hospital, serving as Matron from 1916 to 1936, and ending up as its Superintendent. In later years, whenever his dignified speech patterns caused listeners to assume that he had received a public school education, Muir would demur: &quot;I was educated in E10, not Eton&quot;. He attended Leyton County High School for Boys, though prior to this he was a pupil at Chatham House Grammar School, in Ramsgate, Kent, whose notable alumni include former Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath. He left school prematurely aged fourteen and a half at his father&#x27;s death, due to the necessity of earning an income to support the family. Muir claimed that, when interviewed to join the RAF, he was &quot;a weedy &quot; but that he later &quot;stabilised at a bent &quot;.

==Early career==
Muir joined the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of the Second World War and spent several years in the photographic technical school taking slow-motion film of parachute jumps on a project intended to decrease the frequency of parachutes failing (sometimes called a &#x27;Roman Candle&#x27;). His work provided the manufacturers with the information they needed to improve both the equipment and the training, which was very effective in reducing the number of failures as well as the fatality and injury rate. He was also assigned to take pictures of the agents of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for identity documents at the training centre at RAF Ringway.

Muir, as a photographic technician, was posted to Iceland, which was then a Danish possession under British occupation, and while there, he did some work for the forces radio station. Also while stationed in Iceland – as he described in his memoirs &quot;A Kentish Lad&quot; – Muir suffered a medical condition which required the surgical removal of one testicle.

==Writing for radio==
Upon his return to civilian life, he began to write scripts for Jimmy Edwards. When Edwards teamed up with Dick Bentley on BBC Radio, Muir formed a partnership with Denis Norden, Bentley&#x27;s writer, which was to last for most of his career. The vehicle created for Bentley and Edwards, &quot;Take It From Here&quot;, was written by Muir and Norden from 1948 until 1959; the last series in 1960 used other writers. For &quot;TIFH&quot;, as it became known, they created &quot;The Glums&quot;, a deliberately awful family, which was the show&#x27;s most popular segment. For &quot;TIFH&quot;, Muir and Norden wrote the phrase, &quot;Infamy, infamy, they&#x27;ve all got it in for me&quot;, later used by Kenneth Williams in &quot;Carry on Cleo&quot;. In his autobiography &quot;A Kentish Lad&quot; Muir expressed disappointment that he and Norden were never credited for it.

Muir and Norden continued to write for Edwards when he began to work for BBC television with the school comedy series &quot;Whack-O&quot; and the subsequent 1960 film Bottoms Up!, and in the anthology series &quot;Faces of Jim&quot;. With Norden, in 1962, he was responsible for the television adaptation of Henry Cecil&#x27;s comic novel &quot;Brothers in Law&quot;, which starred a young Richard Briers, and its spin-off &quot;Mr Justice Duncannon&quot;.

The pair were invited to appear on a new humorous literary radio quiz, &quot;My Word!&quot;. In the final round Muir and Norden each told a story to &quot;explain&quot; the origin of a well-known phrase. An early example took the quotation &quot;Dead! And never called me mother!&quot; from a stage adaptation of &quot;East Lynne&quot; by Mrs Henry Wood, which became the exclamation of a youth coming out of a public telephone box which he had discovered to be out of order. In early broadcasts of &quot;My Word!&quot; the phrases were provided by the quizmaster, but in later series Muir and Norden chose their own in advance of each programme and their stories became longer and more convoluted. This became a popular segment of the quiz, and Muir and Norden later compiled five volumes of books containing some of the &quot;My Word!&quot; stories.

Frank Muir was also, like Norden, a contestant on the &quot;My Word!&quot; spinoff, &quot;My Music&quot;. As a television personality, Muir&#x27;s unofficial trademark was a crisply knotted pink bow tie.

==Later career==
In 1954 Muir founded an amateur dramatic society, Thorpe Players, in the village of Thorpe, Surrey where he lived for many years. He was a writer and presenter on many shows, including the 1960s satire programmes &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; and &quot;The Frost Report&quot;. He was well known to television audiences as a team captain on the long-running BBC2 series &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;. Muir found unexpected household fame when he undertook voice-overs for advertisements, including Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit &amp; Nut chocolate &quot;(&quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Fruit and Nut case&quot;&quot;, to the tune of the &quot;Danse des mirlitons&quot; from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;). Other popular advertising campaigns of the period in which Muir appeared included Batchelors&#x27; Savoury Rice &quot;(&quot;Every grain will drive them insane!&quot;)&quot;, a coffee advert in which he used the phrase &quot;impending doom&quot;, and Unigate milk &quot;Humphreys&quot;. In the 1960s Muir was Assistant Head of Light Entertainment at the BBC and in 1969 joined London Weekend Television as Head of Entertainment.

In 1976 Muir wrote &quot;The Frank Muir Book: An irreverent companion to social history&quot;, which is a collection of anecdotes and quotations collected under various subjects including &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Literature&quot;, &quot;Theatre&quot;, &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;Food and Drink&quot;. (In the United States, this book is titled &quot;An Irreverent Social History of Almost Everything.&quot;) A similar format to &quot;The Frank Muir Book&quot; was used in his BBC radio series &quot;Frank Muir Goes Into...&quot;, in which Alfred Marks read the quotations, linked verbally by Muir. He published books based on these series. His &quot;The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose&quot;, which again uses a similar format with more scholarly aspirations, was published in 1990.

Muir was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE in the 1980 Birthday Honours. In 1992, for Channel 4, he was the host of &quot;TV Heaven&quot;, a season of evenings dedicated to television programmes from individual years. In 1997, Muir published an autobiography, &quot;A Kentish Lad&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

In 1949 Muir married Polly McIrvine (d. 2004). They had two children: Jamie (born 1952), a TV producer, and Sally (born 1954), a successful painter who also co-founded the Muir and Osborne knitwear design company, and is married to the journalist and author Geoffrey Wheatcroft.

Muir died in Thorpe, Surrey, on 2 January 1998 aged 77. In November 1998, ten months after his death, he and Denis Norden were joint recipients of the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain Writer of the Year Award. Muir&#x27;s widow, Polly, died in Surrey on 27 October 2004, aged 79.

<doc id="407354" wikidata="Q445822" url="?curid=407354" title="101 (number)">
<text>101 (one hundred [and] one) is the natural number following 100 and preceding 102.

It is variously pronounced &quot;one hundred and one&quot; / &quot;a hundred and one&quot;, &quot;one hundred one&quot; / &quot;a hundred one&quot;, and &quot;one oh one&quot;. As an ordinal number, 101st (one hundred [and] first), rather than 101th, is the correct form.

101 is the 26th prime number and the smallest integer above 100.
It is also a palindromic number, and hence, a palindromic prime.

==In mathematics==

101 is:
*the 26th prime number and the smallest integer above 100.
*a palindromic number in decimal, and so a palindromic prime.
*a Chen prime since 103 is also prime, with which it makes a twin prime pair.
*a sexy prime since 107 and 113 are also prime, with which it makes a sexy prime triplet.
*a unique prime because the period length of its reciprocal is unique among primes.
*an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form formula_1.
*the fifth alternating factorial.
*a centered decagonal number.
*the only existing prime with alternating 1s and 0s in decimal and the largest known prime of the form formula_2.
* the number of compositions of 12 into distinct parts.
* the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of three distinct nonzero squares in more than two ways: formula_3, formula_4 or formula_5 (see image).

Given 101, the Mertens function returns 0. It is the second prime to have this property after 2.

For a 3-digit number in decimal, this number has a relatively simple divisibility test. The candidate number is split into groups of four, starting with the rightmost four, and added up to produce a 4-digit number. If this 4-digit number is of the form formula_6 (where and are integers from 0 to 9), such as 3232 or 9797, or of the form formula_7, such as 707 and 808, then the number is divisible by 101.

On the seven-segment display of a calculator, 101 is both a strobogrammatic prime and a dihedral prime.

==In books==
According to Books in Print, more books are now published with a title that begins with &#x27;101&#x27; than &#x27;100&#x27;. They usually describe or discuss a list of items, such as &quot;101 Ways to...&quot; or &quot;101 Questions and Answers About...&quot; . This marketing tool is used to imply that the customer is given a little extra information beyond books that include only 100 items. Some books have taken this marketing scheme even further with titles that begin with &#x27;102&#x27;, &#x27;103&#x27;, or &#x27;1001&#x27;. The number is used in this context as a slang term when referring to &quot;a 101 document&quot; what is usually referred to as a statistical survey or overview of some topic.

In the book &quot;1984&quot;, written by George Orwell, Room 101 is a designated room used for torture by the Thought Police of Oceania, where the greatest fear known to the Thought Police is unleashed upon the victim.

==In education==
In American university course numbering systems, the number 101 is often used for an introductory course at a beginner&#x27;s level in a department&#x27;s subject area. This common numbering system was designed to make transfer between colleges easier. It can also indicate a course for students not intending to major in the subject; e.g. a student intending to major in English would take &quot;English 111&quot; not &quot;English 101&quot;. 

In theory, any numbered course in one academic institution should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions. One of earliest such usages, perhaps the first, was by the University of Buffalo in 1929.

Based on this usage, the term &quot;&quot; (pronounced ) has gained a slang sense referring to basic knowledge of a topic or a collection of introductory materials to a topic, as in the sentence, &quot;Boiling potatoes is Cooking 101&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the usage of &quot;101&quot; in this slang sense from 1986.

<text>102 (one hundred [and] two) is the natural number following 101 and preceding 103.

==In mathematics==
102 is an abundant number and a semiperfect number. It is a sphenic number.

The sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;x&quot;) over the first eighteen integers is 102.

102 is the first three-digit base 10 polydivisible number, since 1 is divisible by 1, 10 is divisible by 2 and 102 is divisible by 3. This also shows that 102 is a Harshad number. 102 is the first 3-digit number divisible by the numbers 3, 6, 17, 34 and 51.

There are 102 vertices in the Biggs–Smith graph.

==In other fields==
102 is also:
* The emergency telephone number for police in Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Belarus
* The emergency telephone number for fire in Israel
* The emergency telephone number for ambulance in parts of India
* The emergency telephone number for ambulance in Maldives

<text>Linda Helen Smith (29 January 1958 – 27 February 2006) was an English comedian and comedy writer. She appeared regularly on Radio 4 panel games, and was voted &quot;Wittiest Living Person&quot; by listeners in 2002. From 2004 to 2006 she was head of the British Humanist Association.

==Life and career==
Smith was born in Erith, Kent, in 1958 and was educated at Erith College of Technology (now Bexley College) and at the University of Sheffield where she graduated in English and Drama. She was a founder member of the theatre company Sheffield Popular Theatre before turning to comedy. She never joined a political grouping, claiming that The Tufty Club was the only outfit she ever joined. Her early stand-up appearances were with her university friend Ann Lavelle in a double act called Token Women and then Tuff Lovers. They performed at small comedy clubs and many solidarity benefit shows on the Pit Stop Tour which stopped off at miners&#x27; welfare clubs during the latter stages of the 1984/85 national miners&#x27; strike. She became a full-time solo stand-up comedian in 1986.

In 1987, she won the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year, then known as the New London Comic Award, and performed on the Edinburgh Fringe before breaking into radio comedy. Her first professional appearance at the Edinburgh Fringe was in 1988 on a double bill at The Comedy Boom. Between then and 1994, she performed solo shows and shared the stage at various fringe venues with comedy pals such as Henry Normal, Hattie Hayridge and Betty Spital.

Her first appearances on national radio were on Radio 5&#x27;s &quot;The Treatment&quot; in 1997. She was subsequently a regular panellist on &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and appeared frequently on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (from June 2001 onwards), &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;QI&quot;. She wrote and starred in her own Radio 4 sitcom, &quot;Linda Smith&#x27;s A Brief History of Timewasting&quot;. After appearing on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Devout Sceptics&quot; to discuss her beliefs she was asked by the British Humanist Association (BHA) to become president of the society, a role that she occupied with commitment from 2004 until her death. In 2002, she was voted &#x27;Wittiest Living Person&#x27; by listeners to BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;. In his 2003 book Classic Radio Comedy, Mat Coward called Smith &quot;the funniest woman on radio today&quot;.

On 17 November 2003, Smith appeared on the BBC television show &quot;Room 101&quot;, where she successfully managed to put in &quot;adults who read Harry Potter books&quot;, Tim Henman, &quot;Back to School signs that appear in shops&quot; and &quot;posh people&quot;. However, she failed to put in bow ties after host Paul Merton pointed out that Stan Laurel regularly wore a bow tie.

From 2001 to 2004, Smith toured her full-length solo show &#x27;Wrap Up Warm&#x27; to sold-out audiences at theatres and arts centres throughout Britain.

==Illness, death and legacy==
On 27 February 2006 in Wanstead, Smith died as a consequence of ovarian cancer at the age of 48. She had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer three and a half years earlier but, not wanting to be thought of as a patient or a victim, she did not want people to know. Before she died she chose that her funeral be humanist and her memorial at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, on 10 March, was dedicated to the British Humanist Association. Her life and work were honoured at the British Academy Television Awards in 2006. The first episode of Dawn French&#x27;s &quot;Girls Who Do: Comedy&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Smith. A tribute edition of &quot;The News Quiz&quot; featuring clips of Smith&#x27;s appearances and personal memories of her from other panellists was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 3 March 2006, hosted by Simon Hoggart.

Three tribute gigs were held in her memory in 2006. The first took place on 14 May at the Lyceum Theatre, Sheffield, &quot;In Praise of an English Radical&quot;, the second on 4 June at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London entitled &quot;Tippy Top: An Evening of Linda Smith&#x27;s Favourite Things&quot;, and the third was a midnight benefit gig at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh on 22 August. In August 2006, Andy Hamilton presented a BBC Radio 4 tribute entitled &quot;Linda Smith: A Modern Radio Star&quot;. An anthology on CD, entitled &quot;I Think the Nurses Are Stealing My Clothes: The Very Best of Linda Smith&quot;, was released in November 2006 as was a book with the same name. A tribute show of the same name was aired on BBC Radio 4 on 10 November 2006. Smith&#x27;s sell-out stage show &quot;Wrap Up Warm&quot; has been available on CD since November 2006. A biography of Linda&#x27;s life and career, &quot;Driving Miss Smith&quot; written by her partner Warren Lakin, was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in September 2007. A tribute show, &quot;Linda Smith&#x27;s Favourite Things Vol. 2&quot;, was held at the Victoria Palace on 28 October to coincide with the publication of the book.

Smith was working on a third series of &quot;A Brief History of Timewasting&quot; before she became incapacitated by her illness. As a tribute the online radio station BBC 7 ran the previous two series, the first all on one day.

The University of Kent holds The Linda Smith Collection as the foundation of the British Stand-Up Comedy Archive. It includes notes, diaries, scripts, audio-visual recordings, photographs, press cuttings, correspondence and publicity material covering her entire life and career. It was deposited at the University of Kent by Smith&#x27;s partner Warren Lakin in 2013. Since 2015, the University of Kent has organised the annual Linda Smith Lecture, in which comedians and writers have spoken about issues in the comedy industry as well as recalling memories of Smith. To date, the speakers have been Mark Thomas (2015), Andy Hamilton (2016), Susan Calman (2017), Barry Cryer (2018), Jo Brand (2019), Robin Ince (2021), Angela Barnes (2022) and Jan Ravens (2023). A video of Robin Ince&#x27;s Linda Smith Lecture is available as a download from Go Faster Stripe.

Between 2010 and 2014, a series of six tribute shows featuring prominent comedians and musicians called &quot;Loving Linda&quot; took place at the Rose Theatre, Kingston to raise money for Target Ovarian Cancer. Two further &quot;Loving Linda&quot; shows were staged at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh in August 2018 and the Cambridge Theatre, London in October 2018.

In 2019 Chortle published a list of 12 of Smith&#x27;s best jokes to mark her birthday.

==Personal life==
Smith met her partner Warren Lakin when Sheffield Popular Theatre was formed in 1983, and they were together for 23 years until her death.

<text>103 (one hundred [and] three) is the natural number following 102 and preceding 104.

==In mathematics==

103 is a prime number, and the largest prime factor of formula_1. The previous prime is 101. This makes 103 a twin prime. It is the fifth irregular prime, because it divides the numerator of the Bernoulli number formula_2

The equation formula_3 makes 103 part of a &quot;Fermat near miss&quot;.

There are 103 different connected series-parallel partial orders on exactly six unlabeled elements.

103 is conjectured to be the smallest number for which repeatedly reversing the digits of its ternary representation, and adding the number to its reversal, does not eventually reach a ternary palindrome.

<text>105 (one hundred [and] five) is the natural number following 104 and preceding 106.

==In mathematics==
105 is the 14th triangular number, a dodecagonal number, and the first Zeisel number. It is the first odd sphenic number and is the product of three consecutive prime numbers. 105 is the double factorial of 7. It is also the sum of the first five square pyramidal numbers.

105 comes in the middle of the prime quadruplet (101, 103, 107, 109). The only other such numbers less than a thousand are 9, 15, 195, and 825. 

105 is also the middle of the only prime sextuplet (97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113) between the ones occurring at 7-23 and at 16057–16073. 105 is the product of the first three odd primes (formula_1) and is less than the square of the next prime (11) by &gt; 8. Therefore, for formula_2, n ± 2, ± 4, and ± 8 must be prime (a prime k-tuple). In contrast, n ± 6, ± 10, ± 12, and ± 14 must be composite, making a prime gap on either side.

105 is also a pseudoprime to the prime bases 13, 29, 41, 43, 71, 83, and 97. The distinct prime factors of 105 add up to 15, and so do those of 104; hence, the two numbers form a Ruth-Aaron pair under the first definition.

105 is also a number &quot;n&quot; for which formula_3 is prime, for formula_4. (This even works up to formula_5, ignoring the negative sign.)

105 is the smallest integer such that the factorization of formula_6 over Q includes non-zero coefficients other than formula_7. In other words, the 105th cyclotomic polynomial, Φ105, is the first with coefficients other than formula_7.

105 is the number of parallelogram polyominoes with 7 cells.

<text>108 (one hundred [and] eight) is the natural number following 107 and preceding 109.

== In mathematics ==
108 is:

*an abundant number.
*a semiperfect number.
*a tetranacci number.
*the hyperfactorial of 3 since it is of the form formula_1.
*divisible by the value of its φ function, which is 36.
*divisible by the total number of its divisors (12), hence it is a refactorable number.
*the angle in degrees of the interior angles of a regular pentagon in Euclidean space.
*palindromic in bases 11 (9911), 17 (6617), 26 (4426), 35 (3335) and 53 (2253)
*a Harshad number in bases 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16
*a self number.
*an Achilles number because it is a powerful number but not a perfect power.
*a largely composite number because its number of divisors is 12 and no smaller number has more than 12 divisors.
*nine dozen, or three quarters of a gross.

There are 108 free polyominoes of order 7.

The equation formula_2 results in the golden ratio.

This could be restated as saying that the &quot;chord&quot; of 108 degrees is formula_3, the golden ratio.

== Religion and the arts ==

The number 108 is considered sacred by the Dharmic Religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hindu tradition, the Mukhya Shivaganas (attendants of Shiva) are 108 in number and hence Shaiva religions, particularly Lingayats, use malas of 108 beads for prayer and meditation.

Similarly, in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Lord Krishna in Brindavan had 108 followers known as gopis. Recital of their names, often accompanied by the counting of a 108-beaded mala, is often done during religious ceremonies.

The Sri Vaishnavite Tradition has 108 Divya Desams (temples of Vishnu) that are revered by the 12 Alvars in the &quot;Divya Prabandha&quot;, a collection of 4,000 Tamil verses. There are also 108 Shakta pithas (sacred places).

The Sudarshana Chakra is a spinning, discus weapon with 108 serrated edges, generally portrayed on the right rear hand of the four hands of Vishnu.

The total number of Upanishads is 108 as per Muktikā canon.

=== Jainism ===

In Jainism, the total number of ways of Karma influx (Aasrav). 4 Kashays (anger, pride, conceit, greed) x 3 karanas (mind, speech, bodily action) x 3 stages of planning (planning, procurement, commencement) x 3 ways of execution (own action, getting it done, supporting or approval of action).

=== Buddhism ===
In Theravada Buddhism, according to Bhante Gunaratana this number is reached by multiplying the senses smell, touch, taste, hearing, sight, and consciousness by whether they are painful, pleasant or neutral, and then again by whether these are internally generated or externally occurring, and yet again by past, present and future, finally we get 108 feelings. 6 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 108. Thus, the number 108 represents all the possible sensory states that one could experience. 

Tibetan Buddhist malas or rosaries (Tib. Wyl. phreng ba, &quot;Trengwa&quot; ) are usually 108 beads; sometimes 111 including the guru bead(s), reflecting the words of the Buddha called in Tibetan the Kangyur (Wylie: Bka&#x27;-&#x27;gyur) in 108 volumes.
Zen priests wear juzu (a ring of prayer beads) around their wrists, which consists of 108 beads.

The Lankavatara Sutra has a section where the Bodhisattva Mahamati asks Buddha 108 questions and another section where Buddha lists 108 statements of negation in the form of &quot;A statement concerning X is not a statement concerning X.&quot; In a footnote, D.T. Suzuki explains that the Sanskrit word translated as &quot;statement&quot; is &quot;pada&quot; which can also mean &quot;foot-step&quot; or &quot;a position&quot;. This confusion over the word &quot;pada&quot; explains why some have mistakenly held that the reference to 108 statements in the Lankavatara refer to the 108 steps that many temples have.

In Japan, at the end of the year, a bell is chimed 108 times in Buddhist temples to finish the old year and welcome the new one (Joya no Kane ). Each ring represents one of 108 earthly temptations (Bonnō) a person must overcome to achieve nirvana.

=== Other references ===
In the neo-Gnostic teachings of Samael Aun Weor, an individual has 108 chances (lifetimes) to eliminate his egos and transcend the material world before &quot;devolving&quot; and having the egos forcefully removed in the infradimensions.

== Martial arts ==
Many East Asian martial arts trace their roots back to Buddhism, specifically, to the Buddhist Shaolin Temple. Because of their ties to Buddhism, 108 has become an important symbolic number in a number of martial arts styles.

*According to Marma Adi and Ayurveda, there are 108 pressure points in the body, where consciousness and flesh intersect to give life to the living being.
*The Chinese school of martial arts agrees with the Indian school of martial arts on the principle of 108 pressure points.
*108 number figures prominently in the symbolism associated with karate, particularly the Gōjū-ryū discipline. The ultimate Gōjū-ryū kata, &quot;Suparinpei&quot;, literally translates to 108. &quot;Suparinpei&quot; is the Chinese Foochow language pronunciation of the number 108, while &quot;gojūshi&quot; of Gojūshiho is the Japanese pronunciation of the number 54.

<text>Miller Farr Jr. (April 8, 1943 – July 18, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a cornerback for 10 seasons in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL).

Farr attended Wichita State University, lettering in football and track. In his senior year, he led the nation in kickoff and punt returns. He was a member of a family of athletes and artists, including a brother and cousins, football players Mel Farr, Lem Barney, and Jerry LeVias, and cousin, singer Marvin Gaye.

Farr was a first-round draft choice by the AFL&#x27;s Denver Broncos in the 1965 Red Shirt draft, then went to the San Diego Chargers for 1965 and 1966. He played defensive back for the Houston Oilers from 1967 through 1969. During the 1967 season, Farr was the AFL co-leader in interceptions with ten (t – Westmoreland, Janik). Despite a bout with hepatitis, he intercepted two passes for touchdowns in one game in 1968. He led the AFL in interception touchdowns that year and was selected All-AFL and All-Pro.

Following the AFL–NFL merger, Farr signed with the St. Louis Cardinals beginning in 1970 where he finished out his NFL career. In 1974, he played with the Florida Blazers of the World Football League.

A three time American Football League All-Star, Farr established an AFL record for the most touchdowns on pass interceptions in a game (2) and tied the AFL record for a season (3). Farr was selected to the All-Time All-AFL second-team.

Farr was from a family full of professional football players. He was the older brother of former NFL player Mel Farr as well as the uncle of former players Mel Farr, Jr. and Mike Farr. He and his brother attended Hebert High School in Beaumont, Texas, and were among 16 pro footballers given the keys to the city in 1971.

Farr died on July 18, 2023, at the age of 80.

109 is a centered triangular number.

There are exactly:

*109 different families of subsets of a three-element set whose union includes all three elements.
*109 different loops (invertible but not necessarily associative binary operations with an identity) on six elements.
*109 squares on an infinite chessboard that can be reached by a knight within three moves.

There are 109 uniform edge-colorings to the 11 regular and semiregular (or Archimedean) tilings.

The decimal expansion of 1/109 can be computed using the alternating series, with formula_1 the formula_2 Fibonacci number:

<text>Ronald Balfour Corbett (4 December 1930 – 31 March 2016) was a Scottish actor, broadcaster and comedian. He had a long association with Ronnie Barker in the BBC television comedy sketch show &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;. He achieved prominence in David Frost&#x27;s 1960s satirical comedy programme &quot;The Frost Report&quot; (with Barker) and subsequently starred in sitcoms such as &quot;No – That&#x27;s Me Over Here!&quot;, &quot;Now Look Here&quot;, and &quot;Sorry!&quot;

Corbett began his acting career after moving from Edinburgh to London; he had early roles in the TV series &quot;Crackerjack&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot;, and appeared in the films &quot;You&#x27;re Only Young Twice&quot;, &quot;Rockets Galore!&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Some Will, Some Won&#x27;t&quot;, and &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot;. He first worked with Ronnie Barker in the BBC TV series &quot;The Frost Report&quot; in 1966, and the two of them were given their own show by the BBC five years later. &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; ran as a comedy sketch show from 1971 to 1987, and became Corbett and Barker&#x27;s most famous work; Corbett became known for his meandering chair monologues.

==Early life==
Corbett was born on 4 December 1930 at the Simpson Memorial Hospital in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of William Balfour Corbett (1898–1974), a master baker, and his London-born wife Annie Elizabeth Corbett (&quot;née&quot; Main; 1900–1991). He had a brother about six years younger, Allan, and a sister about ten years younger, Margaret. Corbett&#x27;s grandfather was the principal organist at in the early 20th century and features in church histories of the time.

Corbett was educated at James Gillespie&#x27;s Boys School and the Royal High School in the city. After leaving school, he decided he wanted to be an actor while performing in amateur theatricals at a church youth club. His first job, however, was with the Ministry of Agriculture.

Corbett carried out national service with the Royal Air Force, where, at the time, at 5.1 ft tall, he was the shortest commissioned officer in the British Forces. Having enlisted as aircraftman 2nd class Service No.2446942, he received a commission into the secretarial branch of the RAF as a pilot officer (national service) on 25 May 1950. He transferred to the R.A.F. Reserve (National Service List) on 28 October 1951, thereby ending his period of active service. He was promoted to flying officer on 6 September 1952.

==Career==
Following national service, Corbett moved to London to start his acting career. At tall, Corbett was suited to playing roles younger than his years. References to his height frequently cropped up in his self-deprecating humour. In one of his earliest stage appearances, he was billed as &quot;Ronald Corbett&quot; at Cromer in &quot;Take it Easy&quot; in 1956, with Graham Stark. He appeared in &quot;Crackerjack&quot; as a regular in its early days, one episode with the pianist Winifred Atwell. He had a walk-on in an early episode of the 1960s series &quot;The Saint&quot; (as &quot;Ronald Corbett&quot;) and appeared in films including &quot;You&#x27;re Only Young Twice&quot; (1952), &quot;Rockets Galore!&quot; (1957), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), &quot;Some Will, Some Won&#x27;t&quot; (1970) and the film version of the farce &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot; (1973).

Corbett starred in the first London production of the musical &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (as Dromio of Syracuse) in 1963 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, alongside Bob Monkhouse. In 1965 he was in cabaret at &quot;Winston&#x27;s&quot;, Danny La Rue&#x27;s Mayfair nightclub. David Frost saw him and asked him to appear in &quot;The Frost Report&quot;. Corbett was in the West End, playing Will Scarlett in Lionel Bart&#x27;s Robin Hood musical &quot;Twang!!&quot;. It failed, leaving Corbett free to accept. It was while working at Danny La Rue&#x27;s nightclub that Corbett met Anne Hart, whom he was to marry that year. The marriage lasted 49 years, until his death.

===With David Frost===
Corbett first worked with Ronnie Barker in &quot;The Frost Report&quot; (1966–67). The writers and cast were mostly Oxbridge graduates from the Footlights tradition. Corbett said he and Barker were drawn together as two grammar school or state secondary school boys, who had not gone to university. The show was a mixture of satirical monologues, sketches and music. Corbett and Barker were beginning to be thought of as a pair.

They appeared with John Cleese in one of the most repeated comedy sketches in British television: the &quot;Class sketch&quot;. Corbett&#x27;s height provided a key cue for both the visual humour and satirical value of the sketch, as he &quot;looked up&quot; to both Cleese and Barker&#x27;s characters, and he got the pay-off line: &quot;I get a pain in the back of my neck.&quot;

Continuing under Frost, Corbett starred in &quot;No – That&#x27;s Me Over Here!&quot;, a sitcom written by &quot;Frost Report&quot; writers Barry Cryer, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle (ITV 1967–70). Cryer and Chapman wrote two follow-ups: &quot;Now Look Here&quot; (BBC 1971–73) and &quot;The Prince of Denmark&quot; (BBC 1974). Corbett also appeared in &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; (ITV 1968) and hosted &quot;The Corbett Follies&quot; (ITV 1969). Frost was also the promoter of Corbett&#x27;s 1970 novelty single &quot;It&#x27;s All Going Up Up Up&quot;, a satire on inflation.

He was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in April 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while appearing on the &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; programme.

===&quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;===
Corbett&#x27;s BBC television comedy show with Ronnie Barker, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, ran from 1971 to 1987. Barker and Corbett performed sketches and musical numbers. Corbett presented a monologue. Sitting in a large easy chair (emphasising his small size), and usually wearing a Lyle &amp; Scott golfing V-neck sweater, he would stretch telling a simple joke over several minutes, often allowing himself to appear to lose his train of thought.

===Later work===
Corbett&#x27;s best-known role away from &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; was as the 40-something Timothy Lumsden, dominated by his mother, in the sitcom &quot;Sorry!&quot; (1981–88). In 1996, he appeared on the première of the short-lived BBC game show &quot;Full Swing&quot;, hosted by Jimmy Tarbuck. Corbett played Reggie Sea Lions in the film &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; (1997), written by his former &quot;Frost Report&quot; colleague John Cleese.

Corbett hosted the game show &quot;Small Talk&quot; and played minor parts occasionally since its end – such as Griselda in a television production of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 2000, and reviving his armchair monologue routines for a weekly appearance in a stand-up show hosted by Ben Elton. In 2003, he appeared in advertisements for the Sky+ digital television service alongside Alice Cooper. The premise was a running gag about their being happy housemates. In December 2004, Corbett appeared on the BBC news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In 2005, Corbett teamed up again with Ronnie Barker for &quot;The Two Ronnies Sketchbook&quot;, comedy sketches from their original series with newly recorded linking material. Also in March 2005, Corbett appeared with comedian Peter Kay in the music video for the number one single &quot;Is This the Way to Amarillo?&quot; to raise money for &quot;Comic Relief&quot;. Corbett is remembered for accidentally falling on the treadmill that was out of shot in the green screen video; however, he found the fall funny when played back, and it was kept in the final version. He performed in the &quot;Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace&quot; as Mr Tibbs, the Queen&#x27;s butler.
In 2006, Corbett played a hyper-realised version of himself in &quot;Extras&quot;, caught taking drugs at the BAFTA Awards. He also starred as himself in &quot;Little Britain Abroad&quot;, in which Bubbles DeVere tried successfully to seduce him. He opened the centre in Cromer, Norfolk, named after Henry Blogg. Corbett was the castaway in the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 29 May 1971 and 21 October 2007. In 2007, he appeared in an episode of Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The F Word&quot;. He featured as a Slitheen in a &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; episode for Red Nose Day 2009. He had a television interview about his life on 7 November 2009 for &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;.

In February 2010, Corbett was in the John Landis thriller comedy &quot;Burke &amp; Hare&quot;. In August 2010 he was a panellist in the BBC 1 comedy show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;. In the same month, he was the star of the Good Food HD programme &quot;Ronnie Corbett&#x27;s Supper Club&quot; with Rob Brydon and Steve Speirs. The show&#x27;s premise was that the main guest of the programme must choose a meal as if it were their last, and Corbett would cook it for him/her and his other guest, while they chatted about the guest&#x27;s past and their current/future projects. In December of the same year he starred in a one-off special, &quot;The One Ronnie&quot;.

From 2010, Corbett starred in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;When The Dog Dies&quot;. The series reunited him with Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent, the writers of &quot;Sorry!&quot; The series returned to BBC Radio Four for another three series.

==Award and honours==
Already an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), Corbett was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to entertainment and charity. In 2002, the Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh awarded him an honorary degree.

==Personal life==
On 30 May 1966, Corbett married Anne Hart, an actress and dancer; they had two daughters, both became actresses. Their first child, a son, had a heart defect and died when he was 6 weeks old at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, in London.

Corbett lived in Shirley in London from 1970 to 2016. He also had a Scottish home in Gullane, East Lothian and often spoke of wanting to become a beekeeper, but never got around to doing it.

Corbett was a golfer and appeared in celebrity and pro–am events; in 2009, he made a documentary with Colin Montgomerie in which they played at Gleneagles. A keen cricket fan, Corbett was also a president of the cricketing charity the Lord&#x27;s Taverners (1982 and 1987). He supported his local football club, Crystal Palace FC, as well as his hometown club, Heart of Midlothian FC.

In mid-2014, Corbett attended a party at 10 Downing Street hosted by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron. In August 2014, Corbett was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Death==
On 31 March 2016, Corbett died at Shirley Oaks Hospital in Shirley, London. He had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease in March 2015.

John Cleese said that Corbett had &quot;the best timing&quot; he had ever watched. Sir Bruce Forsyth said Corbett&#x27;s death marked &quot;one of the saddest days of my life&quot;. David Walliams, a close friend of Corbett, said that he was his &quot;comedy idol&quot;.

Corbett&#x27;s funeral service was held on 18 April 2016, at the St John the Evangelist Church near his home in Shirley. In tribute to one of his &quot;Two Ronnies&quot; comedy sketches, four candles were displayed at the back of the altar. His body was cremated following a private service at Croydon Crematorium. Mourners included Walliams, Sir Michael Parkinson, Rob Brydon and Jimmy Tarbuck. Barry Cryer, who worked with and first met Corbett 50 years before, said, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of him without smiling... I&#x27;m here and tipping my hat to him.&quot; A memorial service for Corbett was held in Westminster Abbey on 7 June 2017.

His widow, Anne, died on 5 November 2023 in Scotland, aged 90.

<text>114 (one hundred [and] fourteen) is the natural number following 113 and preceding 115.

==In mathematics==
*114 is an abundant number, a sphenic number and a Harshad number. It is the sum of the first four hyperfactorials, including H(0). At 114, the Mertens function sets a new low of -6, a record that stands until 197.
*114 is the smallest positive integer* which has yet to be represented as a3 + b3 + c3, where a, b, and c are integers. It is conjectured that 114 can be represented this way. (*Excluding integers of the form 9k ± 4, for which solutions are known not to exist.)
*There is no answer to the equation φ(x) = 114, making 114 a nontotient.
*114 appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 49, 65, 86 (it is the sum of the first two of these).
*114 is a repdigit in base 7 (222).

<doc id="407376" wikidata="Q1325878" url="?curid=407376" title="The Two Ronnies">
<text>The Two Ronnies is a British television comedy sketch show starring Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett. It was created by Bill Cotton and aired on BBC1 from 10 April 1971 to 25 December 1987. 

The usual format included sketches, solo sections, serial stories and musical finales. Their Four Candles sketch, first broadcast on 18 September 1976, was voted their funniest sketch in a television poll. In 2006, the British public ranked the duo number 6 in ITV&#x27;s poll of TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars.

==Origins==
Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett met in 1963 at the Buckstone Club in the Haymarket, London, where Corbett was serving drinks between acting jobs. At the time, Barker was beginning to establish himself as a character actor in the West End and on radio. They were invited by David Frost to appear in his new show, &quot;The Frost Report&quot;, with John Cleese, but the pair&#x27;s big break came when they filled in, unprepared and unscripted, for eleven minutes during a technical hitch at a British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards ceremony at the London Palladium in 1971. In the audience was Bill Cotton, the Head of Light Entertainment for the BBC, and Paul Fox, the Controller of BBC1. Cotton was so impressed by the duo that he turned to Fox and asked: &quot;How would you like those two on your network?&quot; Unknown to the pair, the renewal of their contract had just been declined by London Weekend Television of rival network ITV, freeing them to change channels. Barker and Corbett were given their own show by the BBC.

==Production==

=== Writing ===
The show was based on the complementary personalities of Barker and Corbett, who never became an exclusive pairing, but continued to work independently in television outside of the editions of the &quot;Two Ronnies&quot;. The show was produced annually between 1971 and 1987. It had many notable writers including Ray Alan, John Cleese, Barry Cryer, Spike Milligan, David Nobbs, David Renwick, Terry Ravenscroft, Eric Idle, John Sullivan, Michael Palin, Bryan Blackburn, Terry Jones, and Laurie Rowley. In addition, Barker used the pseudonym Gerald Wiley when writing sketches. Barker and Corbett would often structure each show themselves, alongside scriptwriters Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent.

===Theme music===
The main theme music for the show was composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst. Although opening and closing credits appear to use different themes, they are respectively the first &amp; third sections of a longer piece.

Another track associated with the show is the stock track &quot;The Detectives&quot; by Alan Tew (also known as the theme to 1975 Yorkshire TV series &quot;The Hanged Man&quot;). This was used for the Charlie Farley &amp; Piggy Malone story &quot;Stop You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot;.

== Format ==

===Newsdesk===
&quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; always opened and closed at the newsdesk, which featured the Ronnies as newsreaders, reading spoof news items. This gave rise to the famous catchphrase at the end of each show:
&quot;Corbett:&quot; That&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got time for, so it&#x27;s &quot;Good night&quot; from me.
&quot;Barker:&quot; And it&#x27;s &quot;Good night&quot; from him.
&quot;Both:&quot; Good night!
=== Sketches ===
The show featured comic sketches in which Barker and Corbett appeared both together and separately, with various additions giving the programme the feeling of a variety show. Barker liked to parody officialdom and establishment figures, as well as eccentrics. Corbett appeared quieter, more often acting as a foil for Barker, but remained an important part of the chemistry. Some of the jokes involved Corbett&#x27;s height and Barker&#x27;s weight:

&quot;Barker:&quot; And now, a sketch about an enormous embarrassment at a small party. Mr. Ronnie Corbett plays the small party.
&quot;Corbett&quot; (pause): And Mr. Ronnie Barker plays the enormous embarrassment!

Other jokes could be playfully risqué, as found on seaside postcards, for example:
&quot;Man&quot; (&quot;sotto voce&quot;): Tickle your botty with a feather tonight?
&quot;Woman&quot; (outraged): I &quot;beg&quot; your pardon? 
&quot;Man:&quot; Particular grotty weather tonight.
Some of the show&#x27;s material contained elements of surreal or left-field humour, in the vein of Monty Python. This wasn&#x27;t surprising, because in the early years of the show many sketches were written by members of the Python troupe themselves (John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, and Terry Jones) and featured eccentric people being comically violent. 

Corbett and Barker joined forces some time after their peers, by which time the comedy world had moved toward satire, absurdist surrealism, and the beginnings of alternative humour. This left the field for more traditional comedy open to Corbett and Barker, who freely indulged in puns, wordplay, misunderstandings, and ridiculous situations.

====Notable sketches====

* Swedish Made Simple (1974) – A Swedish waiter simplifies his customer&#x27;s orders using subtitles where each word is translated to a letter. (&quot;Have you any tea?&quot; becomes &quot;F. U. N. E. T.?&quot;)
* Four Candles (1976) – A hardware shopkeeper becomes increasingly frustrated while misunderstanding what a farmhand is requesting.
* Mastermind (1980) – A contestant on the quiz show &quot;Mastermind&quot; answers each question before last. 
* The Sweet Shop (1980) – A sweet-shop owner whose motto is &quot;nothing is too much trouble&quot; has to deal with a very fussy customer.
* Crossword (1980) – On a train, a slow-witted commuter struggles aloud with his easy crossword while a serious man tries to complete his own intellectual crossword.
* Crossed Lines (1981) – Two men next to each other at supermarket payphones have their conversations unintentionally answering each other.
* Courtroom Quiz (1984) – Patrick Troughton plays a judge overhearing a cross-examination that takes the form of quiz-show questions. 
* The Sheikh in the Grocery Store (1985) – An Arab man struggles to convey his shopping list to the vendor in a grocery store.

===Solo sections===
Both Barker and Corbett had their own solo sections on each show. Barker would have his own heavily wordplay-based sketch, often as the head of a ridiculous-sounding organisation (for example, the &quot;Anti-Shoddy Goods Committee&quot;). Likewise, Corbett always had a discursive solo monologue in each show, when he sat in a chair, facing the camera, attempting to tell a simple joke, but constantly distracting himself into relating other humorous incidents. The joke itself was normally deliberately corny; the humour came from Corbett&#x27;s wild tangents, as well as the anticlimax when he finally reached the punchline.

An example of Ronnie Corbett&#x27;s humour is this short excerpt from a monologue:

===Serial stories===
It became a tradition of the shows to have a continuing serial story which progressed through the eight episodes of a series. These were often fairly bawdy tales with special guest stars. The Two Ronnies also starred in two spin-off silent films labelled &quot;The Two Ronnies Present...&quot;, &quot;By the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Picnic&quot;, written by Barker, mainly silent comedies featuring a squabbling upper-class family with a 1920s feel about them.

====&quot;Hampton Wick&quot; (1971)====
The very first serial of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; was written by Barker, and began as a pastiche of costume dramas about a governess called Henrietta Beckett, played by Madeline Smith. Barker played a sex-starved aristocrat called Sir Geoffrey, and Corbett played his son Edward, but further into the serial, the Ronnies portrayed a wide variety of other characters, including pick-pockets and royals. At the end it is revealed to be just a dream when she wakes up in Hampton Wick Cottage Hospital after having an accident.

====&quot;Done to Death&quot; (1972)====
Piggy Malone (Barker) and Charley Farley (Corbett) are private detectives who investigate a mystery about a murdered family, featuring Sue Lloyd as Blanche Brimstone. As soon as Piggy finds out about the murder in the newspaper, a decision&#x27;s made that means a trip to the country, and there&#x27;s a second murder during an unusual gathering. Also featuring are secretary Miss Whizzer and the rest of the Brimstone family, through which the detectives narrow down the culprit. The first seven episodes of &quot;Done to Death&quot; ended with the words &quot;Only one thing was for certain. There would be very little sleep for anyone that night.&quot;

====&quot;Death Can Be Fatal&quot; (1975)====
Piggy and Charley&#x27;s second serial begins when a frogman delivers a note, and the duo are sent in search of the formula for the Clumsy Drug, alongside Cyd Hayman as Madame Eloise Coqoutte. Corbett and Barker also play the two villains, the notorious Mr Greensleeves and his Japanese henchman Bobjob. In the end the mystery is solved as the formula is revealed on a pair of women&#x27;s knickers. The endings for &quot;Death Can Be Fatal&quot; were based on more, as Corbett put it, &#x27;exaggerated Dick Barton lines&#x27;, such as &quot;Is this the end for our two heroes? What of Madame Cocotte? Is she in some bedroom somewhere, lying in wait with a silencer? Or lying in silence with a waiter? Find out next week in another exciting episode, &quot;Villa of Villainy&quot;.&quot;

====&quot;The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town&quot; (1976)====

Written by Spike Milligan and Ronnie Barker but credited as &quot;Spike Milligan and a Gentleman&quot; (after the fashion of 19th-century minister James Lord Pierpont, who credited himself on occasion as &quot;a gentleman&quot;). Set in Victorian times, it is a Jack the Ripper parody in which a mysterious figure goes around blowing raspberries at members of the upper classes. The raspberries were done by Barker&#x27;s friend David Jason. This entire section of sketches was included in Milligan&#x27;s book &quot;I Told You I Was Ill&quot;.

====&quot;Stop! You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot; (1977–78)====
Piggy and Charley return as Devon&#x27;s yokels are murdered and dumped in London, with support from Kate O&#x27;Mara as the gypsy temptress, Lucy Lee.

====&quot;Sid and Lily, George and Edie&quot; (1978-79)====
This is not so much a serial as a series of sketches with the same characters that spanned series 7. Sid and George enjoy pints while discussing their wives Lily and Edie.

====&quot;The Worm That Turned&quot; (1980)====
Diana Dors guest-starred as the Commander of the State Police in this spoof piece of dystopian fiction set in 2012 in which women rule England. Male and female gender roles are completely reversed, even down to men having women&#x27;s names and vice versa. Men are housekeepers and wear women&#x27;s clothes, and law and order is managed by female guards in boots and hot pants. Big Ben is renamed Big Brenda, the Tower of London is renamed Barbara Castle, and the Union Jack becomes the Union Jill. The watching of chauvinistic films is prohibited, so the Two Ronnies (as Janet and Betty) prepare to escape to Wales.

==== &quot;Band of Slaves&quot; (1981–82)====
The last serial to include Piggy Malone and Charley Farley, in which an all-girl orchestra is sold into white slavery by a demented Chinaman. Elizabeth Larner plays Mrs Bumstead, who notices a mysterious blind man appearing on the cruise ship. Location filmed on board P&amp;O SS Canberra cruise out of Southampton. This was the last of The Two Ronnies&#x27; serials.

===Outside performers===

Apart from Corbett and Barker, several actors from television appeared multiple times in the series, most notably John Owens and Claire Nielson, who appeared in twenty-one and seventeen episodes respectively throughout the series. Other frequent performers include April Walker, John Rutland, Michael Redfern, Jenny Logan, Alec Bregonzi, Carol Hawkins, Dilys Watling, Joyce Windsor, Julia McKenzie, Barbara New, Ian Gray, Johnnie Wade, Patricia Brake (who starred with Barker in the sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;, which aired at the same time as the series), Josephine Tewson, Noel Dyson and Vicki Michelle. The Fred Tomlinson Singers appeared as background singers in twenty-five episodes.

As the series gathered more popularity, the sketches began to feature more famous and well-known British actors, including John Cleese, Patrick Troughton, Stratford Johns, Joan Sims, Patricia Routledge, Jenny Agutter, and Lynda Baron (Ronnie Barker&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Open All Hours&quot;).

Before achieving fame in the sitcom &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;, Barry Howard appeared in several early episodes as an uncredited extra. Other actors who appeared as extras before their rise to fame include Andrée Bernard and John Scott Martin.

===Music===
Another regular feature of the shows was an elaborate musical finale in which Barker and Corbett – sometimes with one or both in drag – and company would sing a medley of songs in character, in barbershop, music hall, Gilbert and Sullivan, George Formby, or other styles, with the original words altered to suit whatever comic situation they were portraying. Some of the finales had Barker and Corbett imitating other performers, like Charles Aznavour, Nana Mouskouri, Dolly Parton, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and Hinge and Bracket.

In the middle of the show, there would also be a cabaret musician or group appearing as a special guest, including New World, Tina Charles, Georgie Fame and Alan Price, Samantha Jones, Dana, Elkie Brooks, Manhattan Transfer, Pan&#x27;s People, Michel Legrand, Barbara Dickson, the Nolan Sisters, Elton John, Marti Webb, Clodagh Rogers, Elaine Paige, and Phil Collins, the last of whom also took part in a few sketches. The program&#x27;s earliest episodes also featured specialty acts, usually in pantomime, by international vaudevillians like Chaz Chase and Jo, Jac and Joni.

==Popularity==
&quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; became one of the most successful and long-running light entertainment shows on British television, broadcast in the prime-time slot of 8 p.m. on a Saturday night, and at its peak, was watched by 18.5 million viewers a show. Following the departure of Morecambe and Wise from the BBC in 1978, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; became the BBC&#x27;s flagship light-entertainment programme, regularly gaining the top viewing figures in the critical Christmas Day audience battle. A memorable &quot;Radio Times&quot; cover for the extended Christmas issue in 1973 had both double acts appearing side by side.

===Spin-offs and compilation series===
In 1986, a multi-part compilation series titled &quot;Twenty Years of the Two Ronnies&quot; was aired, which featured the pair picking some of their classic sketches. It was followed by &quot;Twenty-One Years of the Two Ronnies&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Twenty-Two Years of the Two Ronnies&quot; in 1988.

The pair made no new shows after Christmas 1987, following Barker&#x27;s decision to retire from show business. This was unknown to the audience and even the production team – the only person Barker told was Corbett, and they and their wives all went for a meal straight after the recording, keeping it a very low-key affair.

===&quot;The Two Ronnies in Australia&quot;===
&quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; was regularly screened in Australia on ABC Television, and was repeated several times. In 1986 the series was reported as being into its second or third airing, and being broadcast in a respectable time slot.

In 1979, a series was made for the Nine Network in Australia under the title of &quot;The Two Ronnies in Australia&quot;. It was followed by another series in 1986 with six episodes. These episodes contain many of the original sketches done for the BBC, but reworked for an Australian audience.

===Parodies===
The show was parodied twice by the &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; team, with Mel Smith as Barker and Griff Rhys Jones as Corbett. The first sketch was in Series 3 (1980) called &quot;The Three Ronnies&quot;, including footage of Ronald Reagan, at the time the President of the United States. The second sketch was in Series 4 (1982) and controversially parodied them as &quot;The Two Ninnies&quot;, a pastiche of their opening routine and a musical routine, using exaggerated innuendo, e.g. &quot;Oh vagina, oh vagina, over Chinatown!&quot; Barker in particular was quite offended by this sketch, while Corbett was reportedly amused by it. The latter sketch was written by John Lloyd and Nigel Planer, and the writer of the song was Peter Brewis, who also wrote songs for &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;.

The show is also briefly parodied in &quot;The Fast Show&quot; during a segment of a &#x27;chanel 9&#x27; sketch set during a BAFTA style award ceremony. One of the nominations are &#x27;The Twelve Ronnies&#x27;, and a camera pans across a group of men dressed up to look like Corbett and Barker as they utter their famous &#x27;it&#x27;s goodbye from me&#x27; line in Chanel 9&#x27;s nonsense language.

===Adverts===
Barker and Corbett also made a number of advertisements that appeared on ITV, including for British Leyland (Austin/Morris) in 1979 where Corbett played a villain on the run and, &quot;needing some wheels&quot;, gets salesman Barker to show him round the Austin Morris range. They did a second ad in 1981, for the &quot;BL Double Bonus&quot; campaign, which featured Corbett playing a tax inspector inquiring as to why Barker is running four cars. They also did a series of ads for Hertz car rentals in the 1980s.

==Revivals and comebacks==
The show resurfaced in 1999 for a &quot;Two Ronnies Night&quot;. Ronnie Corbett also presented a &quot;Two Ronnies at the Movies&quot; special that same year. In 2000 &quot;A Tribute to the Two Ronnies&quot; was hosted by Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett themselves.

In 2004, Barker announced that he and Corbett would return to make new episodes, entitled &quot;The Two Ronnies Sketchbook&quot;. This involved the two sitting at the newsdesk introducing their classic sketches. A Christmas special was recorded in July 2005 due to Barker&#x27;s failing health.

Whilst the &quot;Sketchbook&quot; series was transmitted, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; was also the subject of an episode of the BBC documentary &quot;Comedy Connections&quot;. Ronnie Corbett, producers James Gilbert, Terry Hughes and Michael Hurll, as well as writers Ian Davidson, Peter Vincent, David Renwick and Barry Cryer, all spoke about the making of the series. Ronnie Barker did not appear, but excerpts from an interview he gave in 1997 were included.

In 2012, full shows of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; were repeated on ITV3 and Gold. Over Christmas 2006, the ITV3 channel devoted three days to the show, interspersed with Ronnie Corbett&#x27;s reminiscences of the show and Ronnie Barker. On 28 May 2007 many more episodes new to ITV3 were broadcast as well a showing of &quot;The Picnic&quot; and &quot;By the Sea&quot;.

==DVD releases==
The BBC Archives retains all episodes of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; in their entirety that were originally transmitted. In April 2007 (18 months after Barker&#x27;s death), 2 Entertain began releasing &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; on DVD in Britain. Series One and Two, including a definitive collection of their Christmas specials with segments from &quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot;, the Old-Fashioned Christmas Mystery and three other Christmas shows, were released on 30 April, 2 July and 29 October 2007.

As of 24 September 2012, with the release of &quot;The Picnic&quot;, &quot;By the Sea&quot; and &quot;The One Ronnie&quot; as part of &quot;The Complete Collection&quot;, every single episode has now been released on DVD.

<doc id="407380" wikidata="Q212926" url="?curid=407380" title="Endogamy">
<text>Endogamy is the cultural practice of mating within a specific social group, religious denomination, caste, or ethnic group, rejecting any from outside of the group or belief structure as unsuitable for marriage or other close personal relationships. Its opposite, exogamy, describes the social norm of marriage outside of the group. 

Endogamy is common in many cultures and ethnic groups. Several religious and ethnic religious groups are traditionally more endogamous, although sometimes mating outside of the group occurs with the added dimension of requiring marital religious conversion. This permits an exogamous marriage, as the convert, by accepting the partner&#x27;s religion, becomes accepted within the endogamous group. Endogamy may result in a higher rate of recessive gene–linked genetic disorders.

==Adherence==

Endogamy can encourage sectarianism and serves as a form of self-segregation. For instance, a community resists integration or completely merging with the surrounding population. Minorities can use it to stay ethnically homogeneous over a long time as distinct communities within societies that have other practices and beliefs.

The isolationist practices of endogamy may lead to a group&#x27;s extinction, as genetic diseases may develop that can affect an increasing percentage of the population. However, this disease effect would tend to be small unless there is a high degree of close inbreeding, or if the endogamous population becomes very small in size.

==Social dynamics==
The Urapmin, a small tribe in Papua New Guinea, practice strict endogamy. The Urapmin also have a system of kinship classes known as &quot;tanum miit&quot;. Since the classes are inherited cognatically, most Urapmin belong to all of the major classes, creating great fluidity and doing little to differentiate individuals.

The small community on the South Atlantic island of Tristan da Cunha are, because of their geographical isolation, an almost endogamic society. There are instances of health problems attributed to endogamy on the island, including glaucoma and asthma as research by the University of Toronto has demonstrated.

==Genealogy==
Endogamic marriage patterns may increase the frequency of various levels of cousin marriage in a population, and may cause high probability of children of first, second, third cousins, etcetera.

If a cousin marriage has accrued in a known ancestral tree of a person, in historical time, it is referred to as pedigree collapse. This may cause relations along multiple paths between a person&#x27;s autosomal-DNA matches. It creates stronger DNA matches between the DNA matches than expected from the nearest path.

Cousin marriage should not be confused with double cousins, which do not cause a pedigree collapse. Certain levels of sibling marriage and cousin marriage is prevented by law in some countries, and referred to as consanguinity.

A long term pattern of endogamy in a region may increase the risk of repeated cousin marriage during a long period of time, referred to as inbreeding. It may cause additional noise in the DNA autosomal data, giving the impressions that DNA matches with roots in that region are more closely related than they are.

==Examples==

Examples of ethnic and religious groups that have typically practiced endogamy include:
*Aari 
*Alawites
* The Amish of North America
*Various Arab tribes
* Assyrians, indigenous Christian people of upper Mesopotamia
* Armenians have a history of endogamy due to being almost entirely surrounded by Islamic neighbours while being a strongly Christian nation. 
*Békés
*Coptic Christians
* Daylamites, an ethnic group living south of the Caspian Sea in ancient and medieval Persia
* Druze 
* European royalty
* Gitanos typically practice endogamy within their &quot;raza&quot;, or patrigroup.
* Greek Cypriots usually practice endogamy in order to maintain their status as the majority ethnic group on the island of Cyprus.
* Iranian Turkmens
* Lepcha, an ethnic group in India, Nepal, and Bhutan
* Judaism traditionally mandates religious endogamy, requiring that both marriage partners be Jewish, while allowing for marriage to converts. Orthodox Judaism maintains the traditional requirement for endogamy in Judaism as a binding, inherent part of Judaism&#x27;s religious beliefs and traditions.
* The Knanaya, an endogamous group within the St. Thomas Christian Community of India. The community claims to have arrived to India in the fourth century and have been noted for their historical practice of endogamy.
* Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or other religious and/or cultural groups relating to Mormonism
* Sayyids
*Syrian Christians of Kerala, India – but marital conversion is allowed.
* Parsis
* Rajputs
* The Vaqueiros de alzada of Spain
* Yazidis
* Mandaeans
* Most Hindu jatis on the Indian subcontinent, as well as many endogamous baradaris among South Asian Muslims
* The Surti and the Kaanam (Bharuchis) of Gujarat. In Gujarat on either side of the Narmada River lies two major cities, Surat and Bharuch. Those lying south of Narmada are generally termed as Surtis and those north of it are termed as Kaanam. Endogamy was historically practiced amongst these two groups and it continued as they migrated to other regions of the world. Surtis would only marry Surtis and Kaanams would only marry Kaanams. It is only recently in the past 50 years that this practice has been discontinued. Before that, if a girl&#x27;s family could not find a suitable partner amongst their group in the migrated land, they would prefer getting her married to a boy from back home (Gujarat) even though boys of marriageable age would be available in their land of migration.

<text>100 or one hundred (Roman numeral: C) is the natural number following 99 and preceding 101.

==In mathematics==

100 is the square of 10 (in scientific notation it is written as 102). The standard SI prefix for a hundred is &quot;hecto-&quot;.

100 is the basis of percentages ( meaning &quot;by the hundred&quot; in Latin), with 100% being a full amount.

100 is a Harshad number in decimal, and also in base-four, a base in-which it is also a self-descriptive number.

100 is the sum of the first nine prime numbers, from 2 through 23. It is also divisible by the number of primes below it, 25.

100 cannot be expressed as the difference between any integer and the total of coprimes below it, making it a noncototient.

100 has a reduced totient of 20, and an Euler totient of 40. A totient value of 100 is obtained from four numbers: 101, 125, 202, and 250.

100 can be expressed as a sum of some of its divisors, making it a semiperfect number. The geometric mean of its nine divisors is 10.

100 is the sum of the cubes of the first four positive integers (100 = 13 + 23 + 33 + 43). This is related by Nicomachus&#x27;s theorem to the fact that 100 also equals the square of the sum of the first four positive integers: .

100 = 26 + 62, thus 100 is the seventh Leyland number. 100 is also the seventeenth Erdős–Woods number, and the fourth 18-gonal number.

It is the 10th star number (whose digit sum also adds to 10 in decimal).

==In history==
*In medieval contexts, it may be described as the short hundred or five score in order to differentiate the English and Germanic use of &quot;hundred&quot; to describe the long hundred of six score or 120.

==In money==

Most of the world&#x27;s currencies are divided into 100 subunits; for example, one euro is one hundred cents and one pound sterling is one hundred pence.

By specification, 100 euro notes feature a picture of a Rococo gateway on the obverse and a Baroque bridge on the reverse.
The U.S. hundred-dollar bill has Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s portrait; the &quot;Benjamin&quot; is the largest U.S. bill in print.

<text>Lisgar Collegiate Institute is an Ottawa-Carleton District School Board secondary school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The school is located in downtown Ottawa by the Rideau Canal.

==History==

In 1843, a grammar school with 40 paying students was opened in the Sandy Hill area of Ottawa in a house at the corner of Waller Street and Daly Avenue. In 1859, the school became one of the first in Ontario to admit girls. The school changed locations several times in the first few years, and was renamed first Bytown Grammar School and later Ottawa Grammar School. In 1871 the school was raised to a high school and in 1873 to a collegiate institute, becoming Ottawa Collegiate Institute.

The school found a permanent home in 1873 when a lot at what was then the southern edge of the city was purchased. The school board acquired the land on Biddy Street for $3,200 and paid a squatter $100 to give up any claims on the land. Biddy Street was renamed Lisgar Street in 1880 after Lord Lisgar, an Irishman who served as Canada&#x27;s second Governor-General. A Gothic Revival style structure, designed by W.T. Thomas and W. Chesterton, was built at a cost of $26,000. Governor General Lord Dufferin (another Irishman) laid the cornerstone and the school opened in 1874.

In 1892, the school became the first public secondary school in Ontario to hire a female teacher. Four new classrooms were added on the south side in 1892, moving the front wall towards the street and enclosing the front entrance stairs.

A fire in 1893 caused the school to be temporarily closed. Lisgar was one of a limited number of buildings to survive the Great Ottawa fire. There have been a total of 23 fires at the school, including three major ones: 1893, 1915, and 1942.

In 1903, the east wing was built with eight new classrooms. In 1908, Ottawa architect Edgar Lewis Horwood added a west wing with laboratories, an auditorium, and the main tower. The auditorium balcony is suspended by iron rods which lead to huge beams above the ceiling.

A rifle range for the cadet corps, in the now blocked-off fifth-floor attic, was added in 1912. Students practised shooting there until after World War II when shooting moved to the nearby Cartier Square Drill Hall.

A basement cafeteria was added in 1923. After the school was split in 1922 to form Glebe Collegiate Institute, OCI was renamed Ottawa Lisgar Street Collegiate Institute, which was soon shortened to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. Officially, the school remained OCI for several decades. Since the split, Glebe and Lisgar have been traditional rivals.

In 1951, a new gymnasium was built across the street with a tunnel connecting it to the main building. The tunnel was not open for the use of students for many years, but it was re-opened in October 2015. The new building was enlarged in 1962. The Gym Building also includes the school&#x27;s computer science labs, music rooms, and its communication technology classrooms. The area in between the buildings is referred to as &quot;The Mall&quot;, and students must either cross The Mall or the tunnel to travel between the two buildings.

In 1953, the current, near-vertical roof was installed over the previous sloping roof. This was done to reduce the build-up of winter ice. The old roof is still there and there is an odd-shaped attic space between them.

In 1957, Lisgar was the first school in Ontario to introduce a special program for gifted students.

In the 1970s, the Ottawa Board of Education decided to close the school and sell its downtown real estate. This action was blocked by community members and alumni, and the school was completely renovated instead. This renovation included a small westward extension to the auditorium to add fire exits which replaced external fire exits on the north side of the auditorium. To meet fire code requirements, the existing west staircase was moved from the stair tower westward to just beside the entrance to the auditorium. The result is that now many windows on the north wall do not line up as intended. The windows in the stair tower had been placed a half-way between floors to align with the landings. These windows now lead into classrooms and floor-aligned windows lead into the stairway.

In 1996, the third floor of the North building was completely renovated and the science labs were modernized. In March 2003, parts of the first and second floors and the basement of the North building were damaged by a water main break that closed the school for a week, coincidentally before the previously scheduled March Break, thus giving the students two weeks off school. Some minor changes were made to the affected floors in the reconstruction.

===Memorial Hall===
A brass plaque and print were erected by students and alumni in 1986 to Sergeant Edward James Gibson Holland, VC of The Royal Canadian Dragoons, a graduate of Ottawa Collegiate who was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in action during the Boer War at Leliefontein, Komati River, South Africa on November 7, 1900.

The Ottawa Lisgar Collegiate Institute erected a brass plaque which is dedicated to the memory of students of Ottawa Collegiate Institute who died in the Great War. Another memorial is dedicated to the memory of Lieutenant Alexis Hannum Helmer who was killed in action during the war and was part of the inspiration for &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;. Unveiled in 2001, the plaque was erected by the Lisgar Alumni Association.

Another memorial plaque is dedicated to the memory of former Lisgar students who died during the Second World War. A memorial framed poster erected by the school is dedicated to the sixteen Canadians awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery during the Second World War.

Lisgar Collegiate Institute and Vintage Wings of Canada erected a memorial plaque, unveiled in 2008, dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer David Francis Gaston Rouleau, who died during the Second World War while trying to get to Malta.

The Lisgar Collegiate Institute erected a memorial which is dedicated to the memory of former Lisgar students who died or served during the Korean War.

The Lisgar Collegiate Institute erected a memorial frame including a Canadian flag which was flown in Afghanistan which was presented to Lisgar by LCol Plourde.

==Academics==

Lisgar was ranked 12th among all secondary schools in Ontario and 1st in Ottawa by the Fraser Institute in 2021/22. The school serves the neighbourhoods of Sandy Hill, New Edinburgh, Centretown, Rockcliffe Park, and part of Old Ottawa East. In 2006, parents and students camped out overnight to apply for a transfer to Lisgar. Lisgar was ranked number one for public schools in Ottawa and 4th in the province by the Fraser Institute in 2008. Lisgar is also home to the student-run Ottawa-Carleton Educational Space Simulation.

Students have frequently placed in the top ten amongst Canadian Mathematical Olympiad winners. 

The school offers Advanced Placement courses. Apart from Advanced Placement Latin: Vergil and Advanced Placement Spanish, students taking AP courses take an advanced form of a regular course, which provides them with an Ontario Credit, as well as taking the AP exam in May. As of 2016, Lisgar inaugurated its AP Capstone Program which requires students to take AP Seminar and AP Research as well as four other AP Courses with a score greater than 3.

==Music==
Musical ensembles at the school include the concert band (beginner), symphonic winds (senior), concert orchestra (beginner), and Lisgar Symphony Orchestra (senior). Smaller ensembles include the string ensemble, junior and senior jazz bands, and saxophone, flute and clarinet ensembles. These groups take part in music competitions, including the Ottawa Kiwanis Music Festival. All ensembles perform two annual concerts.

==Athletics==
Sports at Lisgar include rugby, soccer, hockey, basketball, rowing, cross country. At the 160th Reunion, an &quot;Athletic Wall of Fame&quot; was established. There have been three inductions to date, with the third group inducted during the 175th Reunion in May 2018.

==Clubs==
Clubs available to students include Lisgar Business Co (aka DECA), Debate Club, Biomedical Club, Model United Nations Club, Chess+ Club, Fim Club, Lisgar&#x27;s Environmental Action Force (LEAF), Ottawa-Carleton Educational Space Simulation (Spacesim), Key Club, Vox Lycei (yearbook), and the school newspaper &quot;Lisgarwrite&quot;.

Lisgar&#x27;s Student Council consists of approximately 30 executive member positions. These include the co-presidents, Student Senator, Secretary, Treasurer, and 5-6 elected grade representatives, alongside 6 committees and several individual roles consisting of the remaining positions. Student Council is responsible for running a variety of school-wide events and activities throughout the course of the school year, including the Annual Pancake Breakfast, the week-long &#x27;Battle of the Grades&#x27;, and the end-of-year &#x27;Oscars&#x27;. 

The school&#x27;s &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; team won the Canadian national finals in the 2008, 2015 and 2017 seasons. In 2006, the school&#x27;s Reach for the Top team became the first Canadian team to participate in the National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT) High School National Championships, placing 25th. In 2008, the Lisgar Reach team became the first team to qualify for both the Canadian Reach for the Top finals and the NAQT High School National Championships in Chicago, placing second in Ontario for Reach and first in their qualifying division (Ottawa) for NAQT. Electing to attend the Reach Nationals in Edmonton, Lisgar came from behind to beat two-time champion University of Toronto Schools 420–415 for the national title. In 2010, Lisgar was able to qualify two teams for the NAQT Chicago tournament.

Lisgar&#x27;s Improv team has won the National Tournament of the Canadian Improv Games in 1999 and 2000, and from 2004 to 2012 qualified for the Canadian National tournament almost every year.

<doc id="407392" wikidata="Q848612" url="?curid=407392" title="A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court">
<text>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court is an 1889 historical novel by American humorist and writer Mark Twain. The book was originally titled A Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court. Some early editions are titled A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.

In the book, a Yankee engineer from Connecticut named Hank Morgan receives a severe blow to the head and is somehow transported in time and space to England during the reign of King Arthur. After some initial confusion and his capture by one of Arthur&#x27;s knights, Hank realizes that he is actually in the past, and he uses his knowledge to make people believe that he is a powerful magician. He becomes a rival of Merlin, who appears to be little more than a fraud, and gains the trust of King Arthur. Hank attempts to modernize the past in order to make people&#x27;s lives better. Hank is disgusted by how the Barons treat the commoners and tries to implement democratic reforms, but in the end, he is unable to prevent the death of Arthur. Hank declares England a republic, but the Catholic Church, growing fearful of his wealth and power, issues an interdict against him.

Twain wrote the book as a burlesque of Romantic notions of chivalry after being inspired by a dream in which he was a knight himself, severely inconvenienced by the weight and cumbersome nature of his armor. It is a satire of feudalism and monarchy that also celebrates homespun ingenuity and democratic values while questioning the for-profit ideals of capitalism and outcomes of the Industrial Revolution. Twain strongly praises the French Revolution, defending the Reign of Terror as a minor problem compared to the monarchy. It is among several works by Twain and his contemporaries that mark the transition from the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era of socioeconomic discourse. It is often cited as a formative example of the fledgling time travel genre.

==Plot==

Hank Morgan, a 19th-century resident of East Hartford, Connecticut, after a blow to the head, awakens to find himself inexplicably transported back in time to early medieval England, where he meets King Arthur.

Many passages are quoted directly from Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, a late medieval collection of Arthurian legends that constitutes one of the main sources on the myth of King Arthur and Camelot. The frame narrator is a 19th-century man (ostensibly Mark Twain himself) who meets Hank Morgan in modern times and begins reading Hank&#x27;s book in the museum in which they both meet. Later, characters in the story retell parts of it in Malory&#x27;s original language. A chapter on medieval hermits also draws from the work of William Edward Hartpole Lecky.

===Introduction to the &quot;stranger&quot;===

The story begins as a first-person narrative in Warwick Castle, where a man details his recollection of a tale told to him by an &quot;interested stranger&quot; who is personified as a knight through his simple language and familiarity with ancient armor.

After a brief tale of Sir Lancelot of Camelot and his role in slaying two giants from the third-person narrative, taken directly from &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Hank Morgan enters and is persuaded to reveal more of his story. Hank is a superintendent because of his proficiency in firearms manufacturing, with 2,000 subordinates. During a disagreement with his subordinates, he sustains a head injury when a man named &quot;Hercules&quot; hits him with a crowbar.

Hank wakes up underneath an oak tree, having no idea how he got there. Hank soon encounters the knight Sir Kay. Kay challenges him to a joust, which is quickly lost by the unweaponed, unarmored Hank as he scuttles up a tree. Kay captures Hank and leads him towards Camelot Castle. Upon recognizing that he has traveled back to the 6th century, Hank realizes that he is the de facto smartest person on Earth and that with his knowledge, he should soon be running things.

Hank is ridiculed at King Arthur&#x27;s court for his strange appearance and dress and is sentenced by them, particularly the magician Merlin, to burn at the stake on June 21. By a stroke of luck, the date coincides with a historical solar eclipse in 528, of which Hank had learned in his earlier life. In prison, he sends the boy whom he christens Clarence (whose real name is Amyas le Poulet) to inform the king that he will blot out the sun if he is executed. Hank believes it is June 20; however, it is actually the 21st when he makes his threat, the day that the eclipse will occur at 12:03 p.m. When the king decides to burn him, the eclipse catches Hank by surprise. However, he quickly convinces the people that he caused it. He makes a bargain with the king, is released, and becomes the second most powerful person in the kingdom. (Twain may have drawn inspiration for that part of the story from a historical incident in which Christopher Columbus exploited foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse.)

Hank is given the position of principal minister to the king and is treated by all with the utmost fear and awe. He proclaims that his only income will be taken as a percentage of any increase in the kingdom&#x27;s gross national product, from his efforts as Arthur&#x27;s chief minister.

=== The takeover ===
Hank learns about medieval practices and superstitions. With his superior knowledge, he is able to outdo alleged sorcerers and miracle-working church officials. At one point, soon after the eclipse, people begin gathering, hoping to see Hank perform another miracle. Merlin, jealous of Hank having replaced him as both the king&#x27;s principal adviser and the most powerful sorcerer of the realm, begins spreading rumors that Hank is a fake. Hank secretly manufactures gunpowder and a lightning rod, plants explosive charges in Merlin&#x27;s tower, places the lightning rod at the top, and runs a wire to the explosive charges. He then announces (when storms are frequent) that he will soon call down fire from heaven and destroy Merlin&#x27;s tower, challenging Merlin to use his sorcery to prevent it. Lightning strikes the rod, triggering the explosive charges and leveling the tower, further diminishing Merlin&#x27;s reputation.

Hank Morgan uses his authority and knowledge to industrialize the country behind the backs of the rest of the ruling class. His assistant is Clarence, a young boy he meets at court, whom he educates, gradually lets in on most of his secrets, and eventually comes to rely on heavily. Hank sets up secret schools, which teach modern ideas and modern English, thereby removing the new generation from medieval concepts, and secretly constructs hidden factories, which produce modern tools and weapons. He carefully selects the individuals he allows to enter his factories and schools.

As Hank gradually adjusts to his new situation, he begins to attend medieval tournaments. A misunderstanding causes Sir Sagramore to challenge him to a duel to the death. The combat will take place when Sagramore returns from his quest for the Holy Grail. Hank accepts and spends the next few years building up 19th-century infrastructure behind the nobility&#x27;s back. He then undertakes an adventure with a wandering girl named the Demoiselle Alisande a la Carteloise, nicknamed &quot;Sandy&quot; by Hank, to save her royal &quot;mistresses&quot; held captive by ogres. On the way, Hank encounters Morgan le Fay. The &quot;princesses&quot;, &quot;ogres&quot;, and &quot;castles&quot; are all revealed to actually be pigs owned by peasant swineherds, but to Sandy, they still appear as royalty. Hank buys the pigs from the peasants, and the two leave.

On the way back to Camelot, they find a traveling group of pilgrims headed for the Valley of Holiness. Another group of pilgrims, however, comes from that direction and bears the news that the valley&#x27;s famous fountain has run dry. According to legend, long ago, the fountain had gone dry as soon as the monks of the valley&#x27;s monastery built a bath with it. The bath was destroyed and the water instantly returned, but this time, it has stopped with no clear cause. Hank is begged to restore the fountain, although Merlin is already trying to do so. When Merlin fails, he claims that the fountain has been corrupted by a demon and that it will never flow again. Hank procures assistants from Camelot, who bring along a pump and fireworks for special effects. They repair the fountain and Hank &quot;banishes&quot; the demon. The fountain restored, Hank goes on to debunk another magician who claims to be able to tell what any person in the world is doing, including King Arthur. However, Hank knows via telephone that the king is riding out to see the restored fountain and not &quot;resting from the chase&quot; as the &quot;false prophet&quot; had claimed. Hank correctly states that the king will arrive in the valley.

Hank has an idea to travel among the poor disguised as a peasant to find out how they truly live. King Arthur joins him but has extreme difficulty in acting like a peasant convincingly. Arthur becomes somewhat disillusioned by seeing for himself the standard of life of his subjects. The two encounter villagers in a minor fiefdom of Arthur&#x27;s realm, where Arthur is taken as a madman when he makes several outlandish and erroneous comments about agriculture. Hank attempts to teach the villagers about a rudimentary value theory of wages that they rebuff and in his zeal to win the argument, accidentally acknowledges that a member of his audience overpaid a worker, a capital offense. The audience then forms a mob that chases Hank and Arthur down. They seem to be delivered from danger when a nobleman invites them into his entourage, but he enslaves them and sells them to another particularly ruthless enslaver, who takes them to London.

Hank steals a piece of metal in London and uses it to create a makeshift lockpick. However, before he can free the king, a man enters their quarters in the dark. Mistaking him for the slave driver, Hank starts a fight with him. They are both arrested. Hank lies his way out, but in his absence, the real slave driver has discovered Hank&#x27;s escape. Since Hank was the most valuable slave, he was due to be sold the next day. The man becomes enraged and begins beating his other slaves, who fight back and kill him. All the slaves, including the king, will be hanged as soon as Hank is found. Hank is captured, but he and Arthur are rescued by a party of knights led by Lancelot, riding bicycles. Then, the king becomes extremely bitter against slavery and vows to abolish it when they get free, much to Hank&#x27;s delight.

Sagramore returns from his quest and fights Hank, who defeats him and seven others, including Galahad and Lancelot, using a lasso. When Merlin steals Hank&#x27;s lasso, Sagramore returns to challenge him again. This time, Hank kills him with a revolver. He proceeds to challenge the knights of Britain to attack him en masse, which they do. After he kills nine more knights with his revolvers, the rest break and flee. The next day, Hank reveals his 19th-century infrastructure to the country.

=== Interdict ===
Three years later, Hank has married Sandy, and they have a baby. When the child falls critically ill, Hank&#x27;s doctors advise him to take his family overseas while the baby recovers. In reality, it is a ploy by the Catholic Church to get Hank out of the country. During the weeks that Hank is absent, Arthur discovers Guinevere&#x27;s infidelity with Lancelot. That causes a war between Lancelot and Arthur, who is eventually killed by Sir Mordred.

The Church then places the land under interdict, causing the people to revolt against Hank. Hank sees that something is wrong and returns to Britain. Clarence informs him of the war. As time goes on, Clarence gathers 52 teenage cadets, who are to fight against all of Britain. Hank&#x27;s band fortifies itself in Merlin&#x27;s Cave with a minefield, electric wire, and Gatling guns. The Church sends an army of 30,000 knights to attack them, but they are slaughtered by the cadets.

However, Hank&#x27;s men are now trapped in the cave by a wall of dead bodies and sickened by the miasma bred by thousands of corpses. Hank attempts to offer aid to any wounded but is stabbed by the first wounded man he tries to help, Sir Meliagraunce. He is not seriously injured but is bedridden. Disease begins to set in. One night, Clarence finds Merlin weaving a spell over Hank, proclaiming that he will sleep for 1,300 years. Merlin begins laughing deliriously but ends up electrocuting himself on one of the electric wires. Clarence and the others all apparently die from disease in the cave.

More than a millennium later, the narrator finishes the manuscript and finds Hank on his deathbed and dreaming about Sandy. He attempts to make one last &quot;effect&quot; but dies before he can finish it.

==Genesis, composition, and contemporary critical response==

Twain&#x27;s first encounter with the &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; occurred in 1880, when someone in his household bought Sidney Lanier&#x27;s bowdlerized edition, &quot;The Boy&#x27;s King Arthur&quot;. Whether he read this children&#x27;s version or not is not known. However, he certainly read the unexpurgated work after his close friend George Washington Cable recommended it to him in November 1884. The pair were traveling on the lecture circuit as the &quot;Twins of Genius&quot; during the winter of 1884-1885 when Cable spotted the &quot;Morte&quot; on the front table of a Rochester, New York, bookstore that both were perusing. Cable pointed to the volume and said, &quot;You will never lay it down until you have read it cover to cover.&quot; Twain bought this copy and read it in nearly one sitting during a train ride to their next lecture date. After his own book&#x27;s great success, Twain credited Cable for his inspiration, referring to him as &quot;the Godfather of my book&quot;.

Soon thereafter, in December 1884, Twain conceived of the idea behind &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; and worked on its realization between 1885 and 1889. The bulk of its composition was done at Twain&#x27;s summer home at Elmira, New York, and was completed in Hartford, Connecticut. It was first published in England by Chatto &amp; Windus under the title &quot;A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur&quot; in December 1889.

Writer and critic William Dean Howells called it Twain&#x27;s best work and &quot;an object-lesson in democracy&quot;. The work was met with some indignation in Great Britain, where it was perceived as &quot;a direct attack on [its] hereditary and aristocratic institutions&quot;.

==Analysis==
The book pokes fun at contemporary society, but the main thrust is a satire of romanticized ideas of chivalry and the idealization of the Middle Ages common in the novels of Sir Walter Scott and other 19th-century literature. Twain had a particular dislike for Scott, blaming his kind of romanticizing of battle for the Southern states&#x27; deciding to fight the American Civil War. He writes in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;:
For example, the book portrays the medieval people as being very gullible, as when Merlin makes a &quot;veil of invisibility&quot; that, according to him, will make the wearer imperceptible to his enemies, though friends can still see him. The knight Sir Sagramor wears it to fight Hank, who pretends that he cannot see Sagramor for effect to the audience.

Hank Morgan&#x27;s opinions are also strongly denunciatory toward the Catholic Church of the medieval period; the Church is seen by the Yankee as an oppressive institution that stifles science and teaches peasants meekness only as a means of preventing the overthrow of Church rule and taxation. The book also contains many depictions and condemnations of the dangers of superstition and the horrors of slavery.

The book provides evidence of Twain&#x27;s growing interest in Georgist economics and social theory. This is particularly evident in the interpretative illustrations by Georgist activist Daniel Carter Beard. Twain approved each illustration, and the editors of &quot;The Mark Twain Encyclopedia&quot; considered the illustrations an essential part of the work.

George Orwell strongly disapproved of the book: &quot;[Twain] squandered his time on boffooneries [such as] &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, which is a deliberate flattery of all that is worst and most vulgar in American Life&quot; (e.g., the various American inventions and institutions Hank Morgan introduces into sixth-century Britain and whose excellence and superiority are taken for granted).

It is possible to see the book as an important transitional work for Twain in that earlier, sunnier passages recall the frontier humor of his tall tales such as &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot;, while the corrosive view of human behavior in the apocalyptic latter chapters is more akin to darker, later Twain works such as &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; and &quot;Letters from the Earth&quot;.

George Hardy notes, &quot;The final scenes of &#x27;Connecticut Yankee&#x27; depict massed cavalry attempting to storm a position defended by wire and machine guns—and getting massacred, none reaching their objective. Deduct the fantasy anachronism of the assailants being Medieval knights, and you get a chillingly accurate prediction of a typical First World War battle... The modern soldiers of 1914 with their bayonets had no more chance to win such a fight than Twain&#x27;s knights.&quot;

One frequently overlooked aspect of the book is the emotional intensity felt by Hank toward his family: wife Sandy and baby Hello-Central. Twain&#x27;s own son, Langdon, died of diphtheria at the age of 19 months, which was likely reflected in Hello-Central&#x27;s membranous croup. Twain also outlived two of his three daughters, but they both died after the completion of the book. The last chapters of the book are full of Hank&#x27;s pronouncements of love, culminating in his final delirium, where &quot;an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you!&quot; is worse than death.

==As science fiction==
While &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; is sometimes credited as the foundational work in the time travel subgenre of science fiction, Twain&#x27;s novel had several important immediate predecessors. Among them are H. G. Wells&#x27;s story &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot; (1888), which was a precursor to &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895). Also published the year before &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; was Edward Bellamy&#x27;s wildly popular &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1888), in which the protagonist is put into a hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up in the year 2000. Yet another American novel that could have served as a more direct inspiration to Twain was &quot;The Fortunate Island&quot; (1882) by Charles Heber Clark. In this novel, a technically proficient American is shipwrecked on an island that broke off from Britain during Arthurian times and never developed any further.

Twain&#x27;s book introduced what remains one of the main literary devices used in time travel literature—a modern person is suddenly hurled into the past by some force completely beyond the traveler&#x27;s control, is stuck there irrevocably, and must make the best of it—typically by trying to introduce modern inventions and institutions into the past society. Several works considered classics of science fiction clearly follow on this pattern set by Twain, such as L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; and Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Came Early&quot;. This strand of time travel literature is clearly distinct from that following the basic pattern of Wells&#x27;s works, where the protagonist is in possession of a time machine and is able to travel at will back and forth in time. The literary device continues to see use throughout modern science fiction, from popular American time travel stories such as Michael Crichton&#x27;s &quot;Timeline&quot; to Japanese Isekai like &quot;Handyman Saitō in Another World.&quot;

* Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 1995 short story &quot;Once and Future&quot; tells a similar story of a time-traveler, Mervin, stranded in a pre-Arthurian &quot;Avalon&quot; who refers to himself as being like &quot;the Connecticut Yankee&quot;.
* In 1998, Disney made another adaptation with Whoopi Goldberg in &quot;A Knight in Camelot&quot;.
* The 2001 film &quot;Black Knight&quot; similarly transports a modern-day American to medieval England (not in the time of King Arthur but in the year 1328) while adding a racial element to the time-traveler plot line.

Several independent films produced during the 1990s drew inspiration from the novel, such as &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992) and the fourth and fifth entries in the &quot;Trancers&quot; series.

In the Carl Sagan novel &quot;Contact&quot;, the protagonist, Eleanor Arroway, is reading &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, specifically the scene where Hank first approaches Camelot, when she finds out about her father&#x27;s death. The quotation Bridgeport?&#x27; Said I. &#x27;Camelot,&#x27; Said he&quot; is also used later in the book, and the story is used as a metaphor for contact between civilizations at very different levels of technological and ethical advancement.

&quot;Yankee&quot; also greatly influenced Soviet sci-fi writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and their two seminal books. In the humorous &quot;Monday Begins on Saturday&quot;, Merlin&#x27;s character is taken entirely from Mark Twain&#x27;s book, and he often references it. &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot; is essentially a remake of &quot;Yankee&quot;, concentrating on the moral and ethical questions of &quot;civilizing the uncivilized&quot;. Its ending is almost identical to &quot;Yankee&quot;: Both main protagonists crumble under the weight of the dead bodies of those they tried to civilize.

The fifth season of TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; features Hank Morgan. He is introduced in the episode &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; as Sir Morgan, a widower with a teenage daughter, Violet, living in a Camelot that exists in a magical reality. Violet becomes a love interest for main character Henry Mills. Morgan does not appear on-screen again but is mentioned in later episodes. He and Violet, along with other Camelot residents, are transported to Storybrooke in the &quot;real&quot; world. When most of Arthur&#x27;s court returns to Camelot, Violet informs Henry that she and her father will stay in Storybrooke since her father is originally from Connecticut in the same world. A tie-in novel, &quot;Henry and Violet&quot;, confirms other details consistent with Twain&#x27;s novel, such as Hank leaving Connecticut in the year 1889.

In the &quot;Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica&quot; series by James A. Owen, Hank appears in several books as a time-traveling &quot;Messenger&quot; recruited by Mark Twain. Hank is able to travel through time and space at will using an enchanted pocket watch, which eventually suffers a malfunction that strands him in the time stream. (Sandy and Hello-Central are not mentioned in the series.)

<doc id="407393" wikidata="Q6312248" url="?curid=407393" title="June Cleaver">
<text>June Evelyn Bronson Cleaver is a principal character in the American television sitcom &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. June and her husband, Ward, are often invoked as the archetypal suburban parents of the 1950s. The couple are the parents of two sons, Wally and &quot;Beaver&quot;. Wally is twelve years old and in the seventh grade when the series opens; Beaver is seven years old (&quot;almost eight&quot;) and in the second grade. Episodes followed the escapades of Wally and Beaver and usually ended with a moral lesson delivered to the boys, but also often included reminders of childhood and minor lessons for the parents through the adventures of their boys. She was included in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 1957–1963.

June is played by Barbara Billingsley in both the pilot, &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; (which aired in April 1957 on &quot;Studio &#x27;57&quot;), and in the original television series. Billingsley also plays the character in the show&#x27;s television reunion movie, &quot;Still the Beaver&quot; (1983), and the show&#x27;s sequel series, &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; (1985—1989). In the sequel series, Wally and Beaver are both parents, and June is a grandmother. Janine Turner played June in the 1997 spin-off film adaptation of the original series, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. Billingsley made a cameo appearance in the spin-off film as Aunt Martha.

==Character overview==
===Early life===
June&#x27;s birthplace is mentioned in one episode as East St. Louis while Ward is teasing her about her upbringing and they are discussing how they met. June attended boarding school as a youngster and was captain of the school&#x27;s basketball team. At one point in her young years, she was a student of Cornelia Rayburn, the principal of Beaver&#x27;s school. It is implied that June had an affluent upper middle class upbringing (contrasted with Ward&#x27;s middle class childhood) which may in part account for June&#x27;s fastidious and fashionable clothing tastes throughout the series. June mentions that she was taught a formal curtsey in the event that she married a diplomat and Aunt Martha frequently proudly refers to their common Bronson lineage. Ward also mentions the Bronson clan&#x27;s concerns about Ward providing for June in a manner she is accustomed to at their wedding. June mentions her father occasionally. Apparently, he was a practical man, for, according to June, he discouraged her as a child from buying an opal ring in a jewelry store window and urged her instead to spend her money on a pair of galoshes.

==Cameos==

Barbara Billingsley has made cameos as June Cleaver in the movie &quot;Airplane&quot; and the Roseanne episode &quot;All About Rosey&quot;.

===Marriage===
As a teen, June knew and dated Ward Cleaver, a farmer&#x27;s son. Ward lived in nearby Shaker Heights. The two attended State college together. June kept her maiden name, &quot;Bronson&quot;, as one of her middle names after marrying Ward. Ward and June have two sons, Wally and Theodore aka &quot;Beaver&quot;. June&#x27;s older son, Wally, is a good student and popular with everyone while young Beaver has a difficult time staying out of trouble. The Cleavers live initially at 485 Mapleton Drive and move to 211 Pine Street at the beginning of the third season.

===Home life===
June is dedicated to her family; her interests outside the home are social events like weddings or school events like meetings and plays. She has ladylike pastimes: needlepoint, cake decorating, and arranging tea roses. She reads glossy but high-toned, tasteful women&#x27;s magazines. In one episode, she entertains the ladies in her social club only to see the event ruined by Beaver&#x27;s monkey who despoils the foods on the dining table.
When the boys arrive home from school, June can be found in the kitchen chopping salad vegetables, basting a roast, or icing a cake. Her kitchen is immaculate. Like most TV middle class sitcom families of the era, the Cleavers eat breakfast and lunch in the kitchen while their dinners are full scale affairs in the dining room.

June&#x27;s taste in home furnishings tends toward British upper class traditional. The front hall in the Pine Street house is adorned with reproductions of Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Boy&quot; and Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Pinkie&quot;&quot; while two fauteuils grace either side of the hall door. A Monet hangs on one wall; a Constable hangs in the living room. A wing chair in the living room is upholstered in a chinoiserie print.
June is ladylike and slightly formal in personal appearance, always seen with perfectly coiffed hair and tasteful facial makeup. She is notorious among the show&#x27;s fans for consistently being dressed as a party hostess, even when doing her housework or relaxing around the house. She wears stylish slacks about the house in a few early episodes, but for most of the series her wardrobe consists of simple but elegant dresses, suits, or skirts paired with blouses or sweaters and high-heeled pumps for shoes. Many of her most attractive housefrocks were worn throughout the series&#x27; run. She wears a pearl necklace in almost every scene, even when gardening.

June is thrilled when her sons are invited to cotillions and birthday parties but wrinkles her nose with disgust when they bring home wriggling earthworms or rain-soaked clothing. She was described by her husband in the series as a &quot;former belle of East St. Louis.&quot;

June and Ward sleep in twin beds and have a portable television set in their room. Now and then, she drives the family&#x27;s Ford Fairlane if she has a specific errand. Ward occasionally dries the dishes for her; at other times, she has to goad him to do minor chores or repairs around the house. June has occasional house help in the person of Minerva and in the later episodes a Mrs. Manners, who (according to Beaver) smells like gingerbread. June does not completely trust Ward&#x27;s Uncle Billy because he fills her sons&#x27; heads with fancies of irresponsible living. She often places Ward in a position where he must &quot;explain&quot; or apologize for his uncle. She is happily married with never a suggestion otherwise on the show.

===Relatives===
In one episode, June has a sister named Peggy and an infant niece. She also has a spinster aunt named Martha Bronson (Madge Kennedy), who appears in a few episodes during the course of the series&#x27; run. No other relatives of hers appear on the show. June credits Martha with raising her, which suggests that June may have been a motherless child. Though if this was so, it is not said when her mother died, as June tells a story of how she told a lie in school and her mother made her get up in front of the class and admit she lied. In one episode she mentioned having lived with both of her biological parents as a child.

===&quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot;===
By the time the 1983 movie &quot;Still the Beaver&quot; aired on CBS, series star Hugh Beaumont had died. As a result, the writers and producers decided to make June a widow.

June still lives in the same home (211 Pine Street) as the original series was set. She lives in the home with her son, Beaver (now a businessman and co-owner of the Cleaver and Rutherford Co. with Clarence &quot;Lumpy&quot; Rutherford) and two grandsons, Kip and Ollie. The living arrangement began when Beaver was divorced from his wife, Kimberly, and Beaver was unemployed; it continued after Beaver found work at a business owned by Fred Rutherford and after Beaver got fired for taking a fall for a mistake that Lumpy made and after Lumpy got fired too after confessing that Beaver took the fall for him, they decided to form a competing company together.

June is a member of the Mayfield City Council.

June has four grandchildren; in addition to Beaver&#x27;s sons, Wally (an attorney) and his wife, Mary Ellen, have two children: Kelly (11 in 1985) and baby Kevin. Kevin was born in 1986 and age-advanced to 4 years old in the following season. Wally and his family live next door to his mother.

<text>Simon David Hoggart (26 May 1946 – 5 January 2014) was an English journalist and broadcaster. He wrote on politics for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and on wine for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Until 2006, he presented &quot;The News Quiz&quot; on BBC Radio 4. His journalism sketches have been published in a series of books.

==Personal life==
Simon Hoggart was born on 26 May 1946 in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, and was educated at Hymers College in Kingston upon Hull, Wyggeston Boys&#x27; School in Leicester, and then King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he excelled at history and English. He was the son of the literary scholar and sociologist Richard Hoggart, and Mary Holt Hoggart. His brother is the &quot;Times&quot; television critic Paul Hoggart. He lived in South London with his wife, Alyson, a clinical psychologist, and their two children, Amy and Richard.

Hoggart was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer in mid-2010 and died of the disease at Royal Marsden Hospital on 5 January 2014.

==Career==
Hoggart joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1968, later becoming the American correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot;, and occasional guest commentator on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot;. Having written on politics for some years in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, Hoggart became the Parliamentary sketch writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1993. He also wrote a wine column for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Hoggart&#x27;s sketchwriting prowess was still admired into the 2010s – &quot;Total Politics&quot; noteD that in 2011 Hoggart had &quot;been a regular tormenter of the prime minister&quot; (David Cameron), &quot;especially on the sensitive issue of the PM&#x27;s bald patch, which Hoggart compared to &quot;a goujon of plaice&quot; from Marks and Spencer&quot;.

In the early 1980s, he chaired the radio comedy show &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, returning to the show in 1996 for another ten years. In March 2006, Hoggart presented his last edition of &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, commenting: &quot;I&#x27;m getting a bit clapped out and jaded, and I think that&#x27;s beginning to show.&quot;

In 1998, he was part of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s 5-part political satire programme &quot;Cartoons, Lampoons and Buffoons&quot;. He was also a contributor to the &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; and wrote for &quot;Punch&quot; magazine and an occasional column for &quot;New Humanist&quot; magazine (last entry May 2005). Hoggart was also an occasional celebrity panellist on BBC2&#x27;s antiques quiz show &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot;.

His published books form an eclectic list, including debunking the supernatural, anecdotes about Parliament, a biography, his thoughts about the United States, a serious political review and collected Christmas round-robin letters. He coined the phrase &quot;the law of the ridiculous reverse&quot;, &quot;which states that if the opposite of a statement is plainly absurd, it was not worth making in the first place&quot;.

When speculation appeared in the &quot;News of the World&quot; in December 2004 suggesting he was the &quot;third man&quot; in the Kimberly Quinn affair, Hoggart initially denied any involvement before issuing a statement admitting that he had HAD an extra-marital affair with Quinn before her own marriage. The political sex scandal involving Quinn contributed to the resignation of David Blunkett from the Cabinet.

<doc id="407398" wikidata="Q367899" url="?curid=407398" title="1001 (number)">
<text>1001 is the natural number following 1000 and preceding 1002.

== In mathematics ==
One thousand and one is a sphenic number, a pentagonal number, a pentatope number and the first four-digit palindromic number. Scheherazade numbers always have 1001 as a factor.

===Divisibility by 7, 11 and 13===
Two properties of 1001 are the basis of a divisibility test for 7, 11 and 13. The method is along the same lines as the divisibility rule for 11 using the property 10 ≡ -1 (mod 11). The two properties of 1001 are

 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13 in prime factors
 103 ≡ -1 (mod 1001)

The method simultaneously tests for divisibility by any of the factors of 1001. First, the digits of the number being tested are grouped in blocks of three. The odd numbered groups are summed. The sum of the even numbered groups is then subtracted from the sum of the odd numbered groups. The test number is divisible by 7, 11 or 13 iff the result of the summation is divisible by 7, 11 or 13 respectively.

Example:

 Number under test, &quot;N&quot; = 22 872 563 219
 Sum of odd groups, &quot;S&quot;o = 219 + 872 = 1091
 Sum of even groups, &quot;S&quot;e = 563 + 22 = 585
 Total sum, &quot;S&quot; = &quot;S&quot;o - &quot;S&quot;e = 1091 - 585 = 506
 506 = 46 × 11

Since 506 is divisible by 11 then &quot;N&quot; is also divisible by 11. If the total sum is still too large to conveniently test for divisibility, and is longer than three digits, then the algorithm can be repeated to obtain a smaller number.

On the Windows calculator, 1001 is the smallest positive integer whose reciprocal is automatically displayed in scientific notation. On Windows Calculator, numbers larger than 1032 and non-terminating decimals smaller than 0.001 or 10−3 are always displayed exponentially.

== In other fields ==

In &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, Scheherazade tells her husband the king a new story every night for 1,001 nights, staving off her execution. From this, 1001 is sometimes used as a generic term for &quot;a very large number&quot;, starting with a large number (1000) and going beyond it:

:&quot;1001 uses for...&quot;
:&quot;1001 ways to...&quot;

In Arabic, this is usually phrased as &quot;one thousand &quot;things&quot; and one &quot;thing&quot;&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot;:

:&quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, in Arabic &quot;Alf layla wa layla&quot; (), literally &quot;One thousand nights and a night&quot;.
1001 was the name of a popular British detergent in the 1960s, supposedly with &quot;1001 uses&quot;.

In the Mawlawiyyah order of Sufi Islam, a novice must complete 1001 days of prayer before becoming a &quot;dada&quot;, or junior teacher of the faith.

In many cases, including the title &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot;, 1001 is meant to indicate a &quot;big number&quot;, and need not be taken literally. A book published in 2007 titled &quot;40 Days &amp; 1001 Nights&quot; describes a journey through the Islamic world.

Among them are recent books aiming to introduce significant works in various fields:
:&quot;1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die&quot;
:&quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;
:&quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;

There are also many film titles starting with 1001. For example:
:&quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot;

The NBA draft lottery uses a lottery with 1,001 combinations by selecting four balls out of 14, then disregards the combination 11, 12, 13 and 14 to produce 1,000 outcomes.

&quot;1001&quot; was a hidden track on the Australian release of &quot;Two Shoes&quot;, the second album by the Cat Empire.

Buckminster Fuller called 1001 a Scheherazade number in his book &quot;Synergetics&quot;, since Scheherazade was the name of the story-telling wife in &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

<text>Alias Smith and Jones is an American Western television series that originally aired on ABC from January 1971 to January 1973. The show initially starred Pete Duel (and, after Duel&#x27;s death, Roger Davis) as Hannibal Heyes and Ben Murphy as Jedediah &quot;Kid&quot; Curry, outlaw cousins who are trying to reform. The governor offers them a clemency deal on two conditions: that they keep the agreement a secret, and that they will remain wanted fugitives until the governor decides that they should receive a formal amnesty.

==Plot==
Operating primarily in Wyoming Territory (1868–1890), cousins Hannibal Heyes and Jedediah &quot;Kid&quot; Curry (whose boyish face spawned the nickname) are the two most successful outlaws in the history of the West. However, crime-fighting methods are evolving to foil them; safes are becoming harder to crack, trains more difficult to stop, and posses more adept at tracking them down.

Heyes, the brains of the Devil&#x27;s Hole Gang, falls in disfavor with fellow members. Deciding to give up their life of crime, he and Curry learn of an amnesty program founded by the territorial governor. Through an old acquaintance, Sheriff Lom Trevors (James Drury in the pilot, alternately Mike Road and John Russell in the series), they contact the governor, who is unsure of how voters will react if he extends leniency to Heyes and Curry. He ultimately strikes a deal to grant them amnesty for their past crimes, with the stipulations that they must not discuss the agreement with anyone and that they will officially still be wanted men until such time as the governor decides that they deserve full clemency.

The cousins reluctantly accept the deal, but find life as law-abiding citizens to be more difficult than expected. Now calling themselves Joshua Smith and Thaddeus Jones, they find themselves tangling with lawmen, bounty hunters, operatives of the Bannerman Detective Agency (a fictional alias for the Pinkerton Detective Agency), and other nefarious figures. They are forced to rely on Heyes&#x27; silver tongue, Curry&#x27;s fast draw, and occasionally a little help from friends on both sides of the law.

==Cast and characters==
Heyes was deemed &quot;cunning,&quot; with Curry &quot;gunning.&quot; Heyes/Smith was considered the brains of the duo and an excellent poker player. Curry/Jones was the master gun hand and the brawn. Usually, Heyes figured out ways to make money and save the twosome from precarious situations. Starting with &quot;The Man Who Broke the Bank at Red Gap&quot; (season two, episode 16), a slightly revamped introduction partially explained why the renowned duo did not split to evade capture—they were cousins. Roger Davis&#x27; original theme voiceover referred to the characters as &quot;latter-day Robin Hoods.&quot; The new introduction replaced that description with the phrase &quot;Kansas cousins.&quot; It remained so after Ralph Story reworked the introduction, once Davis assumed the Heyes role. After Davis took over as Heyes, his distinctive voice could no longer be used in the theme introduction. Ralph Story was brought in to provide narration for the series (he, rather than Davis, had done so in the pilot).

When the cousins were children, all four of their parents were slaughtered during the &quot;border wars&quot; just before the Civil War (q.v. Kansas-Missouri Border War) (&quot;The Men That Corrupted Hadleyburg&quot;, season two, episode 17). In &quot;The Man Who Broke the Bank at Red Gap,&quot; Heyes remarks, &quot;My cousin and I are not Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry.&quot; Curry also speaks of their &quot;sage old grandfather.&quot; In the first episode with Davis, &quot;The Biggest Game in the West&quot; (season two, episode 19), Heyes shouts to Curry: &quot;Yes sir! Cousin, you&#x27;re all right!&quot; In the episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Mad, Get Even,&quot; Curry and Heyes both make reference to their Irish grandfather Curry.

Recurring characters include:
*Kyle Murtry (Dennis Fimple) and Wheat Carlson (Earl Holliman), members of the Devil&#x27;s Hole Gang, formerly led by Heyes and Curry.
*Harry Briscoe (J. D. Cannon) is a Bannerman detective who occasionally finds himself on the wrong side of the law.
*Patrick &quot;Big Mac&quot; McCreedy (Burl Ives) and Señor Nestor Armendariz (Cesar Romero) are two ranchers on opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border/Rio Grande waging a feud over a valuable bust which represents land that had been owned by Armendariz until the river temporarily switched course, moving the border with it, allowing MacCreedy to sell the land. Heyes and Curry get stuck in the middle.
*Clementine &quot;Clem&quot; Hale (Sally Field) is an old friend who has no problem with blackmailing the reformed outlaws when necessary. Field had appeared in only one episode before Duel&#x27;s death, and she could not return due to being pregnant with her second child. Several scripts intended for her were rewritten to feature Georgette &quot;George&quot; Sinclair, who was played by Michele Lee. In the third season, Field did appear as Clem one last time, doing love scenes with former &quot;Flying Nun&quot; co-star Alejandro Rey.
*Soapy Saunders (Sam Jaffe) and Silky O&#x27;Sullivan (Walter Brennan) are retired confidence men on whom the boys call when in need of a large sum of cash and a good con to get them out of trouble.

===Recasting of Hannibal Heyes===
In the early morning hours of December 31, 1971, series star Pete Duel died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 31. He was reportedly suffering from depression and had been drinking heavily when he shot himself. Upon learning of Duel&#x27;s death, executive producer Jo Swerling Jr. initially wanted to end the series, but ABC refused. Swerling later stated:

ABC said, &quot;No way!&quot; They said, &quot;You have a contract to deliver this show to us, and you will continue to deliver the show as best you can on schedule or we will sue you.&quot; Hearing those words, Universal didn&#x27;t hesitate for a second to instruct us to stay in production. We were already a little bit behind the eight ball on airdates. So, we contacted everybody, including Ben (Murphy), and told them to come back in. The entire company was reassembled and back in production by one o&#x27;clock that day shooting scenes that did not involve Peter — only 12 hours after his death.

Series writer, director, and producer Roy Huggins contacted actor Roger Davis (who provided narration for the series, and who had also appeared in episode 19 &quot;Smiler with a Gun&quot;) the day of Duel&#x27;s death to fill the role of Hannibal Heyes, and actor/voice man Paul Frees came in to loop Duel&#x27;s unfinished ADR on &quot;The Men That Corrupted Hadleyburg&quot;. Davis was fitted for costumes the following day, and began reshooting scenes Duel had previously completed for an unfinished episode the following Monday. According to Swerling, the decision to continue production so soon after Duel&#x27;s death was heavily criticized in the press at the time.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; began with a made-for-TV movie of the previous year called &quot;The Young Country&quot; about con artists in the Old West. It was produced, written, and directed by Roy Huggins, who served as executive producer of the show. Under the pseudonym John Thomas James, Huggins shared the writing credit on most episodes of the series that followed. It was broadcast on 17 March 1970 in the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot; strand.

Roger Davis starred as Stephen Foster Moody, and Pete Duel had the secondary but significant role of Honest John Smith. Joan Hackett played a character called Clementine Hale; a character with the same name appeared in two &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; episodes, played by Sally Field. This pilot was rejected, but Huggins was given a second chance and, with Glen A. Larson, developed &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;. As with the previously rejected pilot &quot;The Young Country&quot;, this series pilot proper also aired as an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;.

It was made in the same spirit as many other American TV series of the time, from Huggins&#x27; own &quot;The Fugitive&quot; to &quot;Renegade&quot;, about fugitives on the run across America who get involved in the personal lives of the people they meet. The major difference was that Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry were guilty of the crimes for which they were accused, but were trying to begin a noncriminal life.

The series was modeled on the 1969 film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. (Universal contract player Ben Murphy was offered to the producers because he was considered a Paul Newman lookalike.) A number of similarities are seen between the film and the TV series: one of the lead characters in the film was called Harvey Logan (played by Ted Cassidy). In real life, Harvey Logan, also known by the nickname of Kid Curry, was an associate of the real Butch Cassidy, and unlike the TV version, was a cold-blooded killer.

The TV series also featured a group of robbers called the Devil&#x27;s Hole Gang, loosely based on the Hole in the Wall Gang from which Cassidy recruited most of his outlaws. To lend them an element of audience sympathy, Heyes and Curry were presented as men who avoided bloodshed (though Curry did once kill in self-defense) and always were attempting to reform and seek redemption for their &quot;prior ways&quot;.

The names &quot;Smith&quot; and &quot;Jones&quot; originated from a line in the 1969 film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, when before one of their final hold-ups, the characters are outside a bank in Bolivia and Sundance turns to Butch and says: &quot;I&#x27;m Smith and you&#x27;re Jones.&quot;

===Locations===
Parts of the television series were filmed at Castle Valley and Professor Valley in Utah.

===Cancellation===
The series continued for another 17 episodes after the recasting of Hannibal Heyes, but never regained its popularity after the loss of Duel. This, as well as the fact that the long-prominent Western genre was giving way to police dramas, brought the show to an end on January 13, 1973. On January 16, 1973, &quot;Bonanza&quot; aired its final episode, leaving the 18-year-old &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, the syndicated comedy western &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot;, and &quot;Kung Fu&quot; as the only Westerns scheduled for Fall 1973.

==Episodes==

==Home media==
The entire series has been released on DVD.
Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the complete first season of &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; in Region 2 on June 11, 2007.

==Original tie-in novels==
American Western author Todhunter Ballard, better known as W.T. Ballard, wrote six original novels based on the series, under his tie-in pseudonym &quot;Brian Fox.&quot; Only the first two were published in the United States, by Award Books, between 1971 and 1972. The television series, however, was so popular in the UK that after first run episodes were exhausted, the first two novels were reprinted and distributed by London-based publisher Tandem Books, who also released the four additional titles, all in 1976. Since Award and Tandem were affiliated publishers, it&#x27;s unclear if Award commissioned all six books and dropped the book series as the show&#x27;s American popularity waned, unwittingly leaving the then-unpublished manuscripts to be rejuvenated later, or if Tandem returned to Ballard for the additional titles.

Each book is a standalone novel and they can be read in any order. Following, however, is the order of publication.
* &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; (1971)
* &quot;The Outlaw Trail&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; (1976)
* &quot;Apache Gold&quot; (1976)
* &quot;Dragooned&quot; (1976)
* &quot;Trick Shot&quot; (1976)

==References in other works==
*The title was spoofed in the 1980s British comedy series &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;.
*In his comedy book &quot;Lolly Scramble&quot;, comedian Tony Martin makes reference to the irony of the opening narration &quot;they never shot anyone!&quot; with Duel only ultimately shooting himself. Even more bizarre, as Martin remarks, the person reading that line took over Duel&#x27;s role.
*In episode 6 of series 1 of The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, while Reggie is pretending to be dead and staying in a bed-sit, the lights go out whenever the landlady watches BBC2, &quot;she is an aficionado of Alias Smith and Jones&quot;.

<doc id="407414" wikidata="Q21614067" url="?curid=407414" title="China Drama Academy">
<text>The China Drama Academy () was a Peking opera school in Kowloon, Hong Kong, known for being the childhood home of such famous actors as Jackie Chan (Yuen Lo), Sammo Hung (Yuen Lung), Yuen Biao, Yuen Wah, Yuen Qiu and Corey Yuen (Yuen Kwai). Famed filmmaker Yuen Woo-ping also attended the school for one year as a day student.

It was run from a small theatre in the Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park by Master Yu Jim Yuen, a northern (北拳) kung fu practitioner and a very stern teacher. Children were usually enrolled for a period of 10 years, whilst Yu taught them the acrobatic and acting skills that would later introduce many of them into the world of Chinese theatre and movies.

Whilst attending the Peking opera school under the tutelage of Yu Jim Yuen, the students all adopted their sifu&#x27;s given name &quot;Yuen&quot; as their family name.

==Life in the school==
Practice at the Peking Opera School was very strict. The students signed into contracts that would allow the instructors to punish them up until death. Training would take place up to 18 hours a day and included stretching, weapons training, acrobatics, martial arts and acting.
In an interview in 2008, Jackie Chan described the experience:

It was really arduous, we hardly had enough to eat, enough clothes to keep warm, training was extremely tiring, and Master could cane us anytime!

Hung retorted:

...at that time, majority of the people in Hong Kong were poor. It was equally gruelling whichever profession you were in. We were considered fortunate. Our Master was an exceptional person, and he adopted Jackie Chan as his son, and doted on him the most. [..] Our Master took in many disciples, but he didn&#x27;t take a single cent from us, and even slept on the floor together with us.

In Chan&#x27;s biography, he elaborates on how students would be made to adopt the horse stance and other balancing poses, for long periods of time. If one student fell, they would be beaten and all students would be made to restart the exercise.

Whilst there, Chan earned the nickname &quot;Double Boy&quot; from the other students, because he would often have to endure twice the training as the other students, but had twice the spirit. According to his book &quot;I Am Jackie Chan&quot;, one of the reasons Chan excelled was because he had been &quot;adopted&quot; by Yu at the request of his parents. This meant any failure would have been a particular embarrassment, so he was made to practice for longer and often when others made mistakes, Chan was punished twice as hard as the perpetrator.

==The Seven Little Fortunes==
The Seven Little Fortunes (), sometimes known as The Lucky Seven, were a performance troupe consisting of the China Drama Academy&#x27;s most capable students. Aged as young as seven or eight years old, they travelled and showed their acrobatic and acting skills to domestic and Western audiences in theatres and venues such as Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park (a.k.a. Lai-yuen Amusement Park). The school also sent these students to work for movie studios as extras.

Though there were more than seven pupils in the troupe at any one time (some estimates say 14), only seven would appear in each performance. Jackie Chan was one of the Seven Little Fortunes and, when asked about his most famous pupil, Master Yu Jim Yuen said that Jackie was &quot;not one of the best, but the naughtiest, yes.&quot;

Known members include Jackie Chan (Yuen Lo), Sammo Hung (Yuen Lung), Yuen Biao, Yuen Wah, Corey Yuen (Yuen Kwai), Yuen Qiu, Yuen Tak, Yuen Tai, and Yuen Mo.&quot; Painted Faces&quot; (1988) is a biographical film about The Seven Little Fortunes during their youth at the Peking Opera School.

<doc id="407415" wikidata="Q4864565" url="?curid=407415" title="Barry Norman">
<text>Barry Leslie Norman (21 August 1933 – 30 June 2017) was a British film critic, television presenter and journalist. He presented the BBC&#x27;s cinema review programme, &quot;Film...&quot;, from 1972 to 1998.

==Early life==
Born at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, on 21 August 1933, Norman was the eldest of three children of film director Leslie Norman, and Elizabeth Norman (née Crafford). He was brother of script editor and director Valerie Norman (making him the former brother-in-law of Bernard Williams). Norman was educated at a state primary school and then at Hurstpierpoint College in West Sussex – at the time, the college did not admit the sons of tradespeople and there was a lengthy debate as to whether his father&#x27;s occupation as a film editor was a trade or not. At age 12 he went to Highgate School, then an all-boys independent school in North London from January 1946 until July 1951. He did not go to university, opting instead to study shipping management at Islington Technical College.

==Career==
Norman began his career in journalism with the West London newspaper &quot;The Kensington News&quot;. He later spent a period in South Africa working for &quot;The Star&quot; in Johannesburg, then moving to Salisbury, Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe) where he wrote for &quot;The Rhodesia Herald&quot;. In Africa he developed a hostility to the effects of apartheid.

When he returned to the UK, Norman became a gossip columnist for the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, and then show business editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; until March 1971, when he was made redundant when the two papers merged. Subsequently, he wrote a column for &quot;The Observer&quot; and each Wednesday for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, also contributing leader columns to the newspaper. He was one of the collaborators with Wally Fawkes on the long-running cartoon strip &quot;Flook&quot;. He contributed a column to the &quot;Radio Times&quot; for many years, and wrote several novels.

Norman presented BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Film...&quot; programme from 1972, becoming the sole presenter the following year. The theme was a recording of Billy Taylor playing his 1952 composition &quot;I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free&quot;. Norman&#x27;s involvement was interrupted in 1982 by a brief spell presenting &quot;Omnibus&quot;. After returning to the &quot;Film&quot; series in 1983, Norman became increasingly irritated by the BBC&#x27;s reluctance to screen it at a regular time, and in 1998 finally accepted an offer to work for BSkyB, where he remained for three years. Jonathan Ross took his place as the BBC programme&#x27;s presenter.

In a 2013 article for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Norman listed what he considered to be the 49 best British films of all time. The list included &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953), &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981) and &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012). Norman explained: &quot;In most cases the criteria I used was whether these films were going to last; whether new generations of cinema goers would want to watch them in 20 years time [...] Most are quite old films, but they all appeal to this generation of film-goers as much as they did when they were first made.&quot;

Norman wrote and presented a number of documentary series for the BBC and ITV, including &quot;Hollywood Greats&quot; (1977–1983), &quot;Barry Norman&#x27;s Guide to American Soaps&quot; (1985), &quot;Talking Pictures&quot; (1987) and &quot;Soaps Down Under&quot; in 1991.

In 1982 Norman presented &quot;Omnibus&quot;.

Norman was, together with Elton Welsby, the main anchorman for Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

Norman presented part of Comic Relief in 1990 and 1991.

Norman was for some years a regular radio broadcaster on BBC Radio 4. In 1974, he presented &quot;Today&quot;, and was the first chairman of &quot;The News Quiz&quot;. He was the original presenter of the BBC Radio 4 transport and travel show &quot;Going Places&quot; and of its sister travel magazine, &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Other shows included &quot;The Chip Shop&quot;, an early 1980s series dedicated to the emerging home computer industry. In 1996, he presented an interview series for BBC Radio 5 Live.

Norman was associated with the phrase &quot;and why not?&quot;, which was often attributed to that of his puppet likeness on the satirical ITV show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. Norman explained to &quot;Empire&quot; magazine in 2014 that it had originated from a Rory Bremner sketch show on Channel 4. Norman later adopted the phrase himself, and it is the title of his 2003 autobiography.

In 2008, Norman launched a brand of pickled onions using a recipe handed down through his family.

== Personal life ==
Norman married author Diana Narracott—only four days his junior—on 12 October 1957; the couple lived in Datchworth, Hertfordshire, for many years and both of their daughters (Samantha and Emma) were born there. Diana Norman died on 27 January 2011 at the age of 77. Norman&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;See You in the Morning&quot; was written as a celebration of their life together.

Norman had a passion for cricket and wrote a book on the subject. He was a member of the MCC and enjoyed spending time at Lord&#x27;s watching cricket.

==Political views==
Norman was a supporter of the Liberal Democrats, having been a supporter of the Labour Party until the formation of the Social Democratic Party in 1981. He named Shirley Williams as the politician he most admired.

==Death==
Norman died in his sleep, aged 83, on 30 June 2017, at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage having been afflicted with lung cancer in his later years. A memorial service was held at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden in April 2018.

===Tributes===
Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, journalist Dennis Barker and film critic Derek Malcolm said that Norman &quot;perfected a flair for talking beguilingly about cinema to a mass television audience but in a way that did not make true aficionados wince. As the presenter and critic of BBC TV’s original &quot;Film 72&quot; through to &quot;Film 98&quot;, he was knowledgeable without affectation, and he did not seem overawed by the industry&#x27;s leading lights.&quot; Chief &quot;Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that Norman&#x27;s &quot;enthusiasm and love for film always shone through&quot; and he was &quot;an accessible, unpretentious surveyor of cinema&quot;. Mark Kermode wrote that &quot;watching Barry Norman review films was a pleasure, an education, and an inspiration. Wit, knowledge and wry enthusiasm. He was the Master&quot;, and Jonathan Ross, who replaced him as presenter of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Film...&quot; series, described him as &quot;a great critic and a lovely, lovely man&quot;.

<doc id="407428" wikidata="Q1944303" url="?curid=407428" title="Rebecca Front">
<text>Rebecca Louise Front (born 16 May 1964) is an English actress, writer and comedian. She won the 2010 BAFTA TV Award for Best Female Comedy Performance for &quot;The Thick of It&quot; (2009–2012). She is also known for her work in numerous other British comedies, including the radio show &quot;On The Hour&quot; (1992), &quot;The Day Today&quot; (1994), &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You… with Alan Partridge&quot; (1994), &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot; (2000–2002), sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot; (2002), and &quot;Nighty Night&quot; (2004–2005).

Front has also been seen in a number of dramatic roles, including Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent in &quot;Lewis&quot; (2006–2014), Mrs. Bennet in &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot; (2013), Mrs. Landau in &quot;The Eichmann Show&quot; (2015), Vera in &quot;Humans&quot; (2015), and &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; (2019). Her theatre credits include the musicals &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;The Fix&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Sam Mendes.

==Early life==
Front was born in Stoke Newington, London, to Sheila and Charles Front. Her mother wrote children&#x27;s books, which her father illustrated. Her father also designed the title-logo on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. Her father is Jewish and her mother is of Jewish and Welsh descent. Front was brought up in Reform Judaism.

Front became involved in comedy while at St Hugh&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford, where she read English and became the first female president of The Oxford Revue. She also trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==
While at Oxford in 1984, Front took part in the revue &quot;Stop the Weak&quot;. The tour played in Oxford itself, the Gate Theatre, Notting Hill, Edinburgh, Salisbury, and Romsey. In 1985, Front teamed up with Sioned Wiliam and Jon Magnusson to take the show &quot;The Bobo Girls go BOO&quot; to Edinburgh. She made a short promotional video on energy conservation with Michael Simkins in the late 1980s. 

Front achieved a higher profile as a result of her work with Stewart Lee and Richard Herring on the radio shows &quot;Lionel Nimrod&#x27;s Inexplicable World&quot; and &quot;On the Hour&quot;, and the television and radio series &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;. She went on to form a close professional association with Chris Morris, Armando Iannucci, Doon Mackichan and Steve Coogan, who all transferred with Front to &quot;The Day Today&quot;, the television version of &quot;On the Hour&quot;. Completing &quot;The Day Today&quot; were Patrick Marber, who was part of the 1984 Oxford University revue with Front and David Schneider, who took part in the 1985 revue. This cast continued to contribute to the Alan Partridge comedy canon throughout the 1990s.

In recent years Front has also become a fixture on comedy panel shows on British television and radio including &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and &quot;If I Ruled The World&quot;. She has also had minor roles in &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, &quot;Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and she has also played straight acting roles in television drama, including &quot;You Can Choose Your Friends&quot;, &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot;, &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;.

In 2003, she was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. From 2006, she has written columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2007, she guest-starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;. Between 2006 until 2014, Front had a recurring role as Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent on the detective drama series &quot;Lewis&quot;, the successor to &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; on ITV.

In 2009 and 2012, respectively, she appeared in the third and fourth series of political satire &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, playing Nicola Murray MP, Secretary of State for Citizenship and Social Affairs and in charge of the dysfunctional &#x27;DoSAC&#x27;, and later, Leader of the Opposition. Front featured in the 2010 BBC comedy series &quot;Grandma&#x27;s House&quot; playing the part of Simon Amstell&#x27;s mother Tanya, and &quot;Just William&quot;, as the mother of William Brown and also starred in the 2011 live-action 3D family comedy film &quot;Horrid Henry: The Movie&quot; as Henry&#x27;s headmistress, Miss Oddbod.

In 2012 Front starred as the psychiatrist in the Sky Arts sketch series &quot;Psychobitches&quot;, where Front&#x27;s character offers therapy to notable women of history and the present day, including Anne Boleyn, Mary Queen of Scots, Mary Shelley, Enid Blyton, Eva Braun, Mary Pickford, Edith Piaf, and Anna Nicole Smith. The series aired on the British television channel Sky Arts 1. The first episode of a second series was broadcast on 25 November 2014. In 2013, she starred in the new Sky Living comedy &quot;The Spa&quot;, in the role of Alison Crabbe. She plays Cox in &quot;The Wrong Mans&quot;, a six-part comedy-thriller for BBC Two. The premiere was on 24 September 2013. She reprised this role in December 2014 for a special two-parter. She narrated &quot;Fox Wars&quot; which was broadcast on 22 October 2013.

In December 2013, Sky Atlantic aired a new comedy series called &quot;Little Cracker&quot;. The second programme in the series was an autobiographical story written by Front and her brother Jeremy. It concerns the time she witnessed the near-drowning of her father in a lake; that incident was closely followed by the death of her grandfather. The proximity of these two experiences caused Front considerable personal anguish. Front was eleven years old at the time and, because of the trauma she suffered, she went through a period of not wanting to attend school. The programme included a comedic treatment of this time in her life, followed by Front and her brother explaining the background to the story, and how they came to write and dramatise it. In the programme, Front was played by Lucy Hutchinson, and her father was played by the actor Richard Lumsden. Samantha Spiro played her mother and Front played her headmistress, Miss Dyson. Front&#x27;s school friend character, Karen, was played by Imogen Front.

For their Christmas season, the BBC commissioned &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot;, a three-part British television drama based on characters created by Jane Austen in her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. The first episode aired on BBC One at 8.15pm on Boxing Day 2013, was based on the best selling novel by P. D. James, the story returns to the world of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and involves its characters in a new tale of murder and emotional mayhem. Front played the part of Mrs Bennet.

In January 2014, Front appeared in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode &quot;Let Us Prey&quot;, about a serial killer who uses medieval torture methods to dispatch their victims. She appeared in the BBC series &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, playing the headmistress at Karen&#x27;s school in early 2014. Front portrayed Fiona in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Love in Recovery&quot;. She also starred in the sitcom &quot;Up the Women&quot; as Helen Bute, the antagonist for three episodes in mid-2013 and a six-episode series in 2015. From 2014 to 2019, she narrated the Channel 4 series &quot;The Supervet&quot;.

In 2017, she co-wrote and appeared in the sitcom &quot;Shush!&quot; on BBC Radio 4, a sitcom set in a library.

<doc id="407429" wikidata="Q1364427" url="?curid=407429" title="Wayanad district">
<text>Wayanad () is a district in the north-east of the Indian state of Kerala, with its administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is the only plateau in Kerala. The Wayanad Plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, the southern portion of the Deccan Plateau. It is set high in the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2,100 meters. Vellari Mala, a high peak situated on the trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point in Wayanad district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. An area of 885.92 km2 in the district is forested. Wayanad has three municipal towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribes in this area. 
The Kabini River, a tributary of the Kaveri River, originates at Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the Chaliyar valley in the neighbouring Nilambur (Eastern Eranad region) in Malappuram district, is known for natural gold fields, which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The Chaliyar river, which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad plateau. The historically important Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.

Wayanad district is bordered by Karnataka (Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Mysore districts) to the north and north-east, Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris district) to the south-east (it is the only district that shares border with both the neighbouring states of Kerala), Malappuram to the south, Kozhikode to the south-west and Kannur to the north-west. Pulpally in Wayanad boasts the only Lava-Kusha temple in Kerala and Vythiri has the only mirror temple in Kerala, which is a Jain temple. Varambetta mosque is the oldest Muslim mosque of Wayanad. Wayanad is famous for its role in the Cotiote War, where Pazhassi Raja with the help of the Kurichya tribe in association with Hindus and Muslims of the Malabar region launched a revolt against the British. Kaniyambetta and Muttil Panchayaths are the centrally located Panchayaths with the best access from all corners of Wayanad, while Tavinjal Panchayath is on the northeast border with Kannur district. The edicts found in the caves of Ambukuthi Mala are evidence that occupation dates from the beginning of the New Age Civilisation.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Wayanad&#x27; is derived from &#x27;vayal nāḍŭ&#x27; (Malayalam) which translates to &#x27;the land of paddy fields&#x27; in English.

==Formation==

Wayanad district lies in the Bayalu Seeme region (highland) of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Geographically it is similar to the neighbouring districts of Kodagu and Mysore of Karnataka, and Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu. Wayanad plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore Plateau.

During the British Raj, Wayanad was a taluk in the erstwhile Malabar District. The regions included in the taluks of Gudalur and Pandalur in the present-day Nilgiris district, also known as Southeast Wayanad, formed part of the erstwhile Wayanad taluk. Southeast Wayanad was part of Malabar District until 31 March 1877, when it was transferred to the neighbouring Nilgiris district due to the heavy population of Malabar and the small area of Nilgiris. Wayanad was a separate revenue division within the Malabar District until 1924.

During the States Reorganisation of 1956 after the independence of India, the Mysore state (present-day Karnataka) claimed Wayanad due to its historical and geographical peculiarities. However the linguistic survey of the 1951 census of India found that 87.5% of the total population of Wayanad were native speakers of Malayalam at that time, while just 6.2% of the total population spoke Kannada.

On 1 January 1957, the erstwhile Malabar District was divided into three: Kannur, Kozhikode, and Palakkad. On the same day Wayanad taluk was split up into North Wayanad and South Wayanad. Initially both of the taluks of Wayanad were included in newly formed Kannur district. However, two months later on 15 March 1957, South Wayanad taluk was transferred into Kozhikode district. The North Wayanad Taluk was transferred to Kozhikode district on 1 January 1979.

Wayanad district was formed by incorporating the taluks of North Wayanad and South Wayanad on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district of Kerala. On the same date, North Wayanad Taluk was renamed as Mananthavady, and South Wayanad was split to form the taluks of Sultan Bathery and Vythiri. Kalpetta in Vythiri taluk became the headquarters of the new district.

==History==


===Pre-history===
Historians believe that human settlements have existed in these parts from at least 1,000 BCE. Much evidence of New Stone Age civilisation can be seen in the hills throughout the present-day Wayanad district. The Edakkal Caves have 6000-year-old rock engravings from the Neolithic age. The recorded history of this district is available only from the 18th century. In ancient times, this land was ruled by the Rajas of the Veda tribe.

===Ezhimala kingdom===
In the earliest part of the recorded history of Wayanad District, Kasaragod-Kannur-Wayanad-Kozhikode Districts in the northern part of present-day Kerala were ruled by the Nannans (Mushika dynasty) who later came to be known as the Kolathiris. Politically the area was part of the Ezhimala Kingdom, with its capital at Ezhimala in present-day Kannur district. The most famous king of Ezhimala was Nannan, whose kingdom extended up to Gudalur, Nilgiris and northern parts of Coimbatore. It is said that Nannan took refuge in the Wayanad hills in the 5th century CE when he was lost to Cheras, just before his death in battle, according to the Sangam works. Wayanad was part of the Karkanad, which included the eastern regions of the Ezhimala kingdom (Wayanad-Gudalur areas including part of Kodagu (Coorg)). Karkanad along with Poozhinadu, which contained much of the coastal belt wedged between Mangalore and Kozhikode was under Ezhimala kingdom with a headquarters at Ezhimala.

Some linguists say that an inscription found in the Edakkal Caves in Wayanad, from the 3rd century CE (approximately 1,800 years old), is the oldest known inscription in Malayalam, as it contains two modern Malayalam words, &quot;Ee&quot; (this) and &quot;pazhama&quot; (old). Historian M. R. Raghava Varier, a specialist in Edakkal cave inscriptions, stated that this would be a &#x27;dangerous interpretation of the script&#x27;. Varier, who discovered the inscription read it as &#x27;Sri Vazhumi&#x27; meaning &#x27;Sri Brahma&#x27; in Tamil and dated it to 3rd–4th century CE, whereas Vedachalam, read it as &#x27;Vazhumi&#x27; and dated it to 5th–6th century CE.

===Kolathunadu===

The Mooshaka kings were considered descendants of Nannan. By the 14th century, Mooshaka Kingdom was known as Kolathirinad and its rulers as Kolathiris. The Kolathunad Kingdom at the peak of its power reportedly extended from the 
Netravati River (Mangalore) in the north to Korapuzha (Kozhikode) in the south with Arabian Sea on the 
west and Kodagu hills on the eastern boundary, also including the isolated islands of Lakshadweep in Arabian Sea.

===Kingdom of Kottayam===

The Kolathiri Dominion emerged into independent 10 principalities i.e., Kadathanadu (Vadakara), Randathara or Poyanad (Dharmadom), Kottayam (Thalassery), Nileshwaram, Iruvazhinadu (Panoor), Kurumbranad etc., under separate royal chieftains due to the outcome of internal dissensions. The Nileshwaram dynasty on the northernmost part of Kolathiri dominion, were relatives to both Kolathunadu as well as Zamorin of Calicut, in the early medieval period.

The origin of Kottayam royal family (the Kottayam referred here is Kottayam-Malabar near Thalassery, not to be confused with Kottayam in Southern Kerala) is lost in obscurity. It has been stated that the Raja of Kottayam set up a semi-independent principality of his own at the expense of Kolathiris. In the 10th century CE, the region comprised erstwhile Taluks of Kottayam, Wayanad and Gudallur was called &quot;Puraikizhanad&quot; and its feudal lord &quot;Puraikizhars&quot;. The Thirunelly inscriptions refer to the division of Puraikizhar family into two branches viz., Elder (&quot;Muthukur&quot;) and Younger (&quot;Elamkur&quot;) in the beginning of the 11th century. In the 17th century Kottayam-Malabar was the capital of Puraikizhanad (Puranattukara) Rajas. It was divided into three branches i.e., Eastern, Western and Southern under separate dignitaries known as Mootha, Elaya and Munnarkur Rajas. The Kottayam Rajas extended their influence up to the border of Kodagu. By the end of the 17th century, they shared the area of Thalassery taluk with the Iruvazhinadu Nambiars and were in possession of North Wayanad and the small Village of Thamarassery which formed the Eastern portion of the present Vadakara, Quilandy and Thamarassery taluks.

Thamarassery pass which connects Wayanad with the city of Kozhikode was laid in the 18th century by Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore.
In 930 AD, emperor Erayappa of Ganga dynasty led his troops to south west of Mysore and after conquering, called it &quot;Bayalnad&quot; meaning the land of swamps. After Erayappa, his sons Rachamalla and Battunga fought each other for the new kingdom of their father&#x27;s legacy. Rachamalla was killed and Battunga became the undisputed ruler of Bayalnad. In the 12th century CE, Gangas were dethroned from Bayalnad by Kadamba dynasty of North Canara. In 1104 CE, Vishnuvardhana of Hoysala invaded Bayalnad followed by Vijayanagara dynasty in the 16th century. In 1610 CE, Udaiyar Raja Wadiyar of Mysore drove out Vijayanagara General and became the ruler of Bayalnad and the Nilgiris. This Bayalnad is the native Kannada name from which Wayanad, its Malayali version, the present name of the district, is derived.

===The Early Kadambas===
Historian Sanu Kainikara states that with the end of the Sangam period, the 4th and 5th centuries brought trouble for the Cheras (who ruled entire Kerala and Kanyakumari District and adjoining areas), in that they lost control over some parts of Kerala which included Wayanad District due to the growing Kadamba power and superiority. This is indicated by the Kadamba inscriptions in Edakal caves of Wayanad.

A contemporary Buddhist work claims that the Kalabhra king Achuta Vikkanta defeated the 3 traditional southern dynasties – Pandya, Chera, and Chola, and even held all their three kings captive. For nearly five centuries, from 5th–10th century CE, the Cheras were reduced to the status of insignificant rulers due to their inability to avoid foreign invasions. They barely clung on to power with very minimal territory and had to survive at the mercy of their northern powerful imperial empires from Karnataka like the Kadambas, the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas and the Kalyani Chalukyas, who invaded and moved through their realm as and when they pleased.

===The Kutumbiyas (Kudumbiyas)===

The two caves of Ampukuthimala (Edakal Caves) in Sulthan Bathery, with pictures on their walls and pictorial writings, speak volumes of a bygone civilisation. At the foot of the Edakal Male (hill) caves, Kannada inscriptions belonging to Canarese chieftain Vishnu Varma of Kutumbiya (Kudumbiya) clan of Mysore dating to c. 5th century CE were discovered which read – &quot;Palapulitaanamtakaari&quot; (or &quot;Pala pulinânam ta-kâri&quot;), &quot;Sri Vishnu Varma Kutumbiya Kulavardhanasya li..it..a..&quot; As per Hultzch, a Chennai epigraphist, it speaks of the glorious descendant of Kutumbiya clan, Kannada chieftain, Vishnu Varma, as one who killed many tigers.

===The Badami Chalukyas===

The inscriptions of the Badami Chalukyas under their founding emperor Pulakeshin I (reign c. 540-567 CE), claim to have defeated the Cheras and the Ezhil Malai rulers, which could be a Pandya dynasty reference, and also annexed the entire Malabar region to their empire. The Pandya, Chera and Chola powers strategised and combinedly attacked the Chalukyas as an alliance in order to avoid repeated reversals.

However, the confederacy was defeated and the Chera king was forced to pay a heavier price, in tribute and indemnity, than his two allies for their misadventure as the Chalukyas had gotten to know the identities of the persons responsible for forming the confederacy.

===The (Western) Gangas===

The recorded history of the Wayanad district exists only from the 10th century onward. In 930 CE, emperor Erayappa of Ganga dynasty led his troops to south west of Mysore and after conquering, called it Bayalnad meaning the land of swamps. After Erayappa, his sons Rachamalla and Battunga fought each other for the new kingdom of their father&#x27;s legacy. Rachamalla was killed and Battunga became the undisputed ruler of Bayalnad.

===The Later Kadambas===

In the 11th century AD, Gangas were dethroned from Bayalnad by Kadamba dynasty of North Canara. Wayanad, called Bayalnad (Kannada) since beginning, was at that time divided into two portions – Bira Bayalnad and Chagi Bayalnad. One of the Mysore inscriptions (alluding perhaps to the treacherous beauty of the country, which attracted the stranger and then laid him low with malaria) says &quot;an adulteress with black waving curls, as adulteress with full-moon face, an adulteress with endless side-glances, an adulteress with adorned slim figure was this storeyed mansion, the double Bayalnad&quot;.

Kadamba Bayalnad rule emerged in the 11th century under the chief Raviyammarasa with Kirttipura, Punnad, as its capital. Kanthirava (1090 CE) was described as ruling Chagi-Bayalnad. Iravi-Challamma (1108 CE) was the ruler of Bira-Bayalnad.

===The Western Chalukyas (Kalyani Chalukyas)===

Under emperor Tailapa II (973–997 CE) many Jain Basthis were built in south India. The Jain centres and agricultural villages of Wayanad came in to existence during this time. There are many proofs, which justify the existence of Jainism in Wayanad.

===The Hoysalas===

In 1104 CE Vishnuvardhana of Hoysala invaded Bayalnad and Nilgiris and annexed them followed by Vijayanagara dynasty in the 14th century. A Kadamba king, Mukkanna-Kadamba ruled Bayal-nad in and around 1138 CE.

===The Vijayanagara empire===

A feudatory chieftain of Sangama dynasty of Vijaynagar, Immadi Kadamba Raya Vodeyayya of Bayalnad Kadambas, is said to have ruled Bayalnad.

===The Mysore Wodeyars and the Sultans===

In 1610 CE Udaiyar Raja Wadiyar of Mysore drove out Vijayanagara General and became the ruler of Bayalnad and the Nilgiris. Bayalnad is the present Wayanad.

An inscription discovered from a Jain Basti at Varadur near Panamaram dated to Saka era 1606 which is 1684 CE, shows that Jainism was still very powerful even in the 17th century. The inscription which was noticed by noted epigraphist and historian M. R. Raghava Varriar, has reference about the earliest Jain settlements and temples in Wayanad. The copper plate inscription which was placed under a water fountain at Varadur Ananthanatha Swami temple deals with the grant of various ritual materials to the Jain Basathis of Wayanad by Lalithappa, the younger son of Bommarasa of the Karkala Aremane Basathi.

The Kannada inscription dated Sakavarsha 1606 (i.e., 1684 CE) Rakthakshi Samvatsara Jeshtabahula Shukravara reads:Karkala aremane basthiya bommarasanu mommaga lalithappanu devapooje chinna belli thamra kanchu upakaranagalu madisi kotta bibara.

The Jain Chaithyalayas or temples referred in the inscription are Arepathra, Bennegodu, Palagondu, Hanneradubeedhi, Puthangadi (Muthangadi) and Hosangadi. The Arepathra Chaityalaya is not yet identified. It is believed that it was at the hilltop near to the Panamaram river. The other Kannada touch place names are identified with their present Malayalam version names as Venniyode, Palukunnu, Sultan Batheri, Puthangadi and Mananthavady respectively. Raghava Varriar says that there were seven Jain centres in Wayanad viz. Manikyapuri, Ksheerapuri, Kalpathi, Vennayode, Palagondu, Hosangadi and Hanneradubeedhi. It is believed that Manikyapuri was at the present day Manichira. The location of Ksheerapuri is not yet identified. Kalpathi may be Kalpetta, the present day Wayanad district headquarters, Anjukunnu was then Hanjugondu, etc.

When Wayanad was under Hyder Ali&#x27;s rule, the ghat road from Vythiri to Thamarassery was constructed. Then the British rulers developed this route to Carter road. When Wayanad was under Tipu Sultan&#x27;s rule British invasion started. Tussle and turbulent times followed. The British claimed Wayanad under the 1792 treaty of Srirangapatna citing it was part of Malabar. Tipu Sultan went in appeal before the governor general. Considering his arguments, relying on the successive Karnataka rule for centuries in Wayanad and its geographical detachment from Malabar, in 1798, Governor General Lord Mornington declared by proclamation that Wayanad had not been ceded to the East India Company by the treaty of 1792. Consequently, the British troops withdrew from Wayanad conceding to Tipu&#x27;s rule.

===Mysore Sultans===

When Wayanad was under Hyder Ali&#x27;s rule, the ghat road from Vythiri to Thamarassery was invented. Then the British rulers developed this route to Carter road. After Hyder Ali, his son Tipu Sultan took control over the territory.

===Colonial era===
Initially the British had to suffer local resistance against their rule under the leadership of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, who had popular support in Thalassery-Wayanad region. In the end, the British could get only the dead body of the Rajah, who killed himself somewhere in the interior of the forest. Thus, Wayanad fell into the hands of the British and with it came a new turn in the home of this area. The British authorities opened up the plateau to the cultivation of tea and other cash crops by constructing roads across the dangerous slopes of Wayanad, to Kozhikode and Thalassery. Later, they extended these new roads to the cities of Mysore and Ooty through Gudalur. Settlers emigrated from all parts of Kerala and the fecund lands proved a veritable goldmine with incredible yields of cash crops. Agriculture Cultivation started broadly after 1900 A.D onwards.

===Post-Independence===
Wayanad eventually became part of Kerala despite its geographical delimitations and political dissent in 1956 on State&#x27;s reorganisation. Even now there is a considerable Kannada speaking population and the reminiscence of centuries old Karnataka rule is omnipresent in Wayanad. Agriculture Cultivation started broadly after 1900 A.D onwards. The British authorities opened up the plateau to cultivation of tea and other cash crops by constructing roads across the dangerous slopes of Wayanad, to Kozhikode and Thalassery. Later, they extended these new roads to the cities of Mysore and Ooty through Gudalur. Settlers emigrated from all parts of Kerala and the fecund lands proved a veritable goldmine with incredible yields of cash crops.

When the State of Kerala came into being in November 1956, Wayanad was part of Kannur district. Later, south Wayanad was added to Kozhikode district. To fulfil the aspirations of the people of Wayanad for development, North Wayanad and South Wayanad were carved out and joined to form the present district of Wayanad. This district came into being on 1 November 1980 as one of the twelve districts of Kerala, consisting of three taluks; Vythiri, Mananthavady, and Sulthan Bathery.

In 2024, landslides in Wayanad killed at least 336 people and 78 are missing. Many of the people killed were workers in the farms, or were members of their families.

==Geography==


Wayanad district stands on the southern tip of the Deccan plateau and includes part of the Western Ghats. The western parts of the district bordering Kozhikode district consists of the Western Ghats covered with dense forest. The district forms a part of the south western Deccan plateau, and is sloped to the east. Quite a large area of the district is covered by forest but the continued and indiscriminate exploitation of the natural resources point towards an imminent environmental crisis. There are a lot of trekking points in this district.
Chembra Peak (2,100m) is the highest peak in the Wayanad district. Banasura Hill (2,079m) is also similar to height of Chembra Hill. Brahmagiri Hill is also another trekking point in Wayanad.

Wayanad district is bounded by protected area network of different biological reserves such as Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary in the West, Mudumalai National Park in the South, Bandipur National Park in the East, Nagarhole National Park in the North East, Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary in the North and Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary in North West which is linked with Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.
The district has rich water resources. There are east flowing and west flowing rivers in the region. One of the major rivers in the district is Kabini River, a tributary of River Kaveri; it is also one of the only three east flowing rivers in Kerala. Kabani has many tributaries including Thirunelli River, Panamaram River and Mananthavady River. All these rivulets help form a rich water resource as well as a distinct landscape for the district. Various streams flow into the Panamaram rivulet while it passes through the mountain gorges and finally the river falls down into Panamaram Valley. After flowing through the district for a certain distance, River Panamaram joins Mananthavady River, which originates from the lower regions of the peak called &#x27;Thondarmudi&#x27;.

=== Banasura Sagar Dam ===
Banasura Sagar Dam across the Karamanathodu River, a tributary of River Kabini, in Kalpetta, is considered to be the largest earth dam in India and the second largest in Asia. The dam is ideally placed in the foothills of Banasura hills, which got its name from &#x27;Banasura&#x27;, the son of King Mahabali, the famous ruler of Kerala. The dam here was constructed on behalf of the Banasurasagar project in 1979, to support the Kakkayam Hydroelectric power project and to meet the water demand for irrigation and drinking purposes. The dam, located around 21 km away from Kalpetta is a tourist destination in Wayanad. Banasura dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.

=== Karapuzha Dam ===
Karapuzha Dam is considered to be one of the biggest earth dams in India, which has been constructed on the Karapuzha River, a tributary of the Kabini River. Vazhavatta in Vythiri taluk of Wynad district for providing irrigation to an area of 5580 ha (CCA) say 5600 hectare in Vythiri and Sultan Bathery taluks of Wynad district of Kerala. The reservoir has a gross storage capacity of 76.50 M Cum and live storage capacity of 72.00 M Cum.

===Flora and fauna===
The soil and climate of Wayanad are suitable for horticulture on a commercial basis. For promoting the cultivation of vegetables and establishing orchards, the Kerala Agricultural University is running a regional Agricultural Research Station at Ambalavayal.

<doc id="407433" wikidata="Q3338988" url="?curid=407433" title="New musicology">
<text>New musicology is a wide body of musicology since the 1980s with a focus upon the cultural study, aesthetics, criticism, and hermeneutics of music. It began in part a reaction against the traditional positivist musicology—focused on primary research—of the early 20th century and postwar era. Many of the procedures of new musicology are considered standard, although the name more often refers to the historical turn rather than to any single set of ideas or principles. Indeed, although it was notably influenced by feminism, gender studies, queer theory, postcolonial studies, and critical theory, new musicology has primarily been characterized by a wide-ranging eclecticism.

==Definitions and history==
New musicology seeks to question the research methods of traditional musicology by displacing positivism, working in partnership with outside disciplines, including the humanities and social sciences, and by questioning accepted musical knowledge. New musicologists seek ways to employ anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, gender studies, feminism, history, and philosophy in the study of music.

In 1980 Joseph Kerman published the article &quot;How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get Out&quot;, calling for a change in musicology. He asked for &quot;a new breadth and flexibility in academic music criticism [musicology]&quot;, that would extend to musical discourse, critical theory and analysis. In the words of Rose Rosengard Subotnik: &quot;For me...the notion of an intimate relationship between music and society functions not as a distant goal but as a starting point of great immediacy...the goal of which is to articulate something essential about why any particular music is the way it is in particular, that is, to achieve insight into the character of its identity.&quot;

Susan McClary suggests that new musicology defines music as &quot;a medium that participates in social formation by influencing the ways we perceive our feelings, our bodies, our desires, our very subjectivities—even if it does so surreptitiously, without most of us knowing how&quot;. For Lawrence Kramer, music has meanings &quot;definite enough to support critical interpretations comparable in depth, exactness, and density of connection to interpretations of literary texts and cultural practices&quot;.

New musicology combines cultural studies with the analysis and criticism of music, and it accords more weight to the sociology of musicians and institutions and to non-canonical genres of music, including jazz and popular music, than traditional musicology did. (A similar perspective became common for American ethnomusicologists during the 1950s.) This has caused many musicologists to question previously held views of authenticity and to make assessments based on critical methods &quot;concerned with finding some kind of synthesis between [musical] analysis and a consideration of social meaning&quot;.

New musicologists question the processes of canonization. Gary Tomlinson suggests that meaning be searched out in a &quot;series of interrelated historical narratives that surround the musical subject&quot; – a &quot;web of culture&quot; For example, the work of Beethoven has been examined from new perspectives by studying his reception and influence in terms of hegemonic masculinity, the development of the modern concert, and the politics of his era, among other concerns. The traditional contrast between Beethoven and Schubert has been revised in the light of these studies, especially with reference to Schubert&#x27;s possible homosexuality.

==Relationship to music sociology==
New musicology is distinct from German music sociology in the work of Adorno, Max Weber and Ernst Bloch. Although some new musicologists claim some allegiance to Adorno, their work has little in common with the wider field of Adorno studies, especially in Germany. New musicologists frequently exhibit strong resistance to German intellectual traditions, especially in regard to nineteenth-century German music theorists including Adolf Bernhard Marx and Eduard Hanslick, and also the twentieth-century figures Heinrich Schenker and Carl Dahlhaus.

A fundamental distinction has to do with attitudes towards modernism and popular culture. Influential, oft-cited essays such as and are highly dismissive of modernist music. German music sociologists tend to be more favorable towards modernism (though by no means uncritically) and severely critical of popular music as inextricably tied to the aesthetics of distraction as demanded by the culture industry. Heinz-Klaus Metzger describes &quot;a fascistic element&quot; in the music of The Rolling Stones. New musicology, on the other hand, often overlaps with postmodern aesthetics; various new musicologists are highly sympathetic towards musical minimalism.

==Criticism==
Vincent Duckles writes, &quot;As musicology has grown more pluralistic, its practitioners have increasingly adopted methods and theories deemed by observers to mark the academy as irrelevant, out of touch with &#x27;mainstream values&#x27;, unwelcoming of Western canonic traditions or simply incomprehensible. Paradoxically, such approaches have distanced music scholarship from a broad public at the very moment they have encouraged scholars to scrutinize the popular musics that form the backbone of modern mass musical culture.&quot;

Critics of new musicology include Pieter van den Toorn and to a lesser extent Charles Rosen. In response to an early essay of McClary, Rosen says that &quot;she sets up, like so many of the &#x27;new musicologists&#x27;, a straw man to knock down, the dogma that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance. (I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)&quot; For David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, however, writing at two later moments, the methods of new musicology have been fully incorporated into mainstream musicological practice.

==Early life==
Moira Stuart was born at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, on 2 September 1949, to Caribbean parents. She has two sisters, Sandra Simmons and Sharon Davis-Murdoch. Her maternal grandfather, Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon, met his wife, Clara Christian, when both were studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where she was the first black woman student.

She was educated in London until she was 13, attending Our Lady&#x27;s Catholic High School, Stamford Hill. She then moved with her family to Bermuda for a time, returning at the age of 15 to London, where she attended college.

==Career==

===Early career===
Stuart began working with the BBC in the 1970s and was a production assistant in the Radio Talks and Documentaries department. She was a continuity announcer and newsreader for both BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 2, reading her first Radio 4 news bulletin in 1978, and in 1980 she played Darong in series one of game show &quot;The Adventure Game&quot;. She moved to television news in 1981, when she co-presented &quot;News After Noon&quot;.

===TV news career===
Stuart was the UK&#x27;s first female African-Caribbean television newsreader. Since 27 August 1981, she has presented on every news bulletin devised on BBC Television apart from the &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. She has also appeared on &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and presented the news on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; programme each Sunday and its successor programme &quot;Sunday AM&quot; with Andrew Marr. She presented the news for &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, until 2 May 2006, when the broadcast was reorganised. Stuart retained her slot on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday AM&quot; show and continued to present some weekend television bulletins on BBC One. She also worked on other long-form programmes for other BBC channels, including BBC Four.
In April 2007 she left &quot;Sunday AM&quot;, resulting in the loss of a regular slot on broadcast TV. This prompted a backlash, accusing the BBC of ageism and sexism. The BBC initially declined to comment on why she was no longer being used, but rumours circulated within the BBC and commercial newsrooms that Stuart had been removed because she was considered &quot;too old&quot; at 57, although Anna Ford had continued anchoring the &quot;BBC One O&#x27;Clock News&quot; until her retirement at 62. This was denied by Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson when he was questioned by a House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee. Thompson stated: &quot;BBC News, News 24, the radio networks, have changed over the years and the traditional role of the newsreader, as opposed to a correspondent or presenter, has virtually died out over the services... We tend to use journalists across BBC news programmes ... to read the news headlines.&quot;

Stuart&#x27;s 26-year career with BBC Television News ended on 3 October 2007. In total, her experience had spanned 34 years of BBC radio and TV.

In April 2009, the departing head of BBC News, Peter Horrocks, was quoted as saying: &quot;I regret the way some viewed her departure. Many people came to believe that Moira left for reasons of ageism, or other -isms. This was never the case.&quot;

She returned to BBC News, reading the news for &quot;The Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot;, on 11 January 2010. She presented her last bulletins for the show on 14 December 2018.

She later joined Classic FM, from February 2019, to present the news on weekdays during the breakfast show, and from July 2019 would be presenting her own Saturday afternoon show, &quot;Moira Stuart’s Hall of Fame Concert&quot;. Stuart, who described the move as &quot;a wonderful opportunity to take a whole new journey, with people I really like and admire&quot;, made her debut on Classic FM on 11 February 2019.

From 9 August 2020, she hosted a Sunday evening series, &quot;Moira Stuart Meets…&quot;, and later, &quot;The Hall of Fame Concert&quot;, 
on Classic FM.

===Other projects===
A keen music lover, Stuart deputised for Humphrey Lyttelton on his BBC Radio 2 &quot;Best of Jazz&quot; programme, has participated in the BBC Jazz Awards as compère, and features as a narrator on Soweto Kinch&#x27;s 2006 jazz-rap album &quot;A Life in the Day of B19: Tales of the Tower Block&quot;.

With Adam Shaw, she also presented the BBC Two personal finance series &quot;Cashing In&quot;.

Stuart has served on various boards and judging panels including Amnesty International, the Royal Television Society, BAFTA, United Nations Association, the Orange Prize, the London Fair Play Consortium, the Human Genetics Commission, the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize, and the Grierson Trust.

In November 2004, Stuart was the subject of an episode of the BBC genealogy documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; (series 1, episode 6), which helped trace her family history.

Stuart was a judge (alongside Jo Brand, Jude Kelly and Joanne Harris) for the Orange Prize in 2005, when the winner was Lionel Shriver with &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot;.

In 2006, Stuart played a comic version of herself in the Ricky Gervais television comedy &quot;Extras&quot;, supposedly involved in supplying drugs to Ronnie Corbett.

In March 2007 she also presented the documentary &quot;In Search of Wilberforce&quot; for BBC Television, examining the role of anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the British bill that banned the slave trade. According to a review of the programme: &quot;The documentary is well-structured and the informed questioning by Stuart enables a debunking of the Wilberforce legend and a challenge to the myopia in Britain which focuses upon the abolitionists rather than those who were enslaved.&quot;

On 2 June 2007, she hosted the BBC One topical news quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, and was well received by the public. The extended and uncut version of the programme (shown the following evening, 3 June 2007) revealed that, while making a spoof appeal for work, she fluffed her lines on a number of occasions but took it all with her traditional good humour.

On 16 November 2007, she visited Mill Hill School in Ripley, Derbyshire, to officially open the new school building alongside Councillor Alan Charles from Derbyshire County Council.

In 2008, 2009 and 2010, she appeared in a series of advertisements for HMRC promoting tax-return procedures.

In March 2014, Stuart began hosting the Sunday late-night BBC Radio 2 programme &quot;Music Until Midnight&quot;, a slot that previously broadcast David Jacobs&#x27; long-running Easy listening programme until 2013. She alternates this Sunday-night slot with Oscar-winning songwriter Don Black. She has also presented music documentary series for Radio 2, including &quot;Strong and Sassy - Inspiring Women of Jazz&quot; (featuring Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan, Adelaide Hall, Anita O&#x27;Day and Lena Horne) and &quot;Jazz Guitar Greats&quot;.

In July 2015, Stuart appeared on the television comedy panel show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; (Series 9, Episode 1).

In 2021, it was announced that she would dance with Aljaž Škorjanec in the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; Christmas Special, which was broadcast on Christmas Day. In 2022, she announced the terms and conditions for the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; Halloween Special.

In November 2022, Stuart appeared as a guest presenter on &quot;Countdown&quot;, as part of the Channel 4 show&#x27;s 40th birthday celebrations.

In September 2024, Stuart decided to speak out after she fell victim to a sophisticated bank scam, stating that it nearly cost her a fortune.

===Family===
Her mother, Marjorie Gordon (1921–2017), who was born in Dominica, and her father Harold Stuart (1914–1966), a Barbadian lawyer, divorced when Stuart was ten months old. Her uncle was the singer Ken Gordon, who was a member, with George Browne, of the vocal trio Three Just Men. Her cousin is the Ghana-born publisher and editor Margaret Busby.

Talking about her ancestry, Stuart has said that she is from a &quot;long line of outsiders&quot; and that she considers herself &quot;a true mongrel – and proud of it&quot;. For the 2004 edition of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in which she featured, she visited the Scottish Highlands, as well as to Antigua (where her great-great-grandfather was enslaved) and to Dominica, where her great-grandfather George James Christian was born. Christian was a delegate at the 1900 First Pan-African Conference in London (making a speech that was reported in &quot;The Times&quot;, about the treatment of South Africans in the Boer War), before migrating to the Gold Coast, West Africa.

During the programme, she discovered the story of how her maternal grandfather Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon met his wife Clara Christian when both were studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where she was the first black woman student. While he completed his degree and qualified as a doctor in 1918 (initially going into practice in Kingussie), Stuart&#x27;s grandmother did not finish medical studies, using money intended for her course to pay their bills instead. The couple ultimately settled in Bermuda, where in addition to being a physician Gordon became a parliamentarian, civil-rights activist and labour leader. In the programme, Stuart was visibly moved to learn more about her ancestors in the context of the Atlantic slave trade, and about their fight for human rights and social justice.

In 2021, on discovering through research by Ancestry UK that, during the Second World War, her mother had worked as a nurse probationer at St Helier Hospital and the children&#x27;s hospital on the same site, Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Carshalton. These twin hospitals were among the most heavily bombed hospitals in England. 

Stuart recalled: &quot;She told me once that literally every time there was a bombing raid, she would take all of the children out of their beds, put them underneath the beds for protection, and those that she couldn’t move she would cover with her own body.&quot;

==Honours, awards and achievements==

<doc id="407442" wikidata="Q2558529" url="?curid=407442" title="George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney">
<text>Field Marshal George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney, (9 February 1666 – 29 January 1737), styled Lord George Hamilton from 1666 to 1696, was a British soldier and Scottish nobleman and the first British Army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal. After commanding a regiment for the cause of William of Orange during the Williamite War in Ireland, he commanded a regiment in the Low Countries during the Nine Years&#x27; War. He then led the final assault at the Battle of Blenheim attacking the village churchyard with eight battalions of men and then receiving the surrender of its French defenders during the War of the Spanish Succession. He also led the charge of fifteen infantry battalions in an extremely bloody assault on the French entrenchments at the Battle of Malplaquet. In later life, he became a Lord of the Bedchamber to George I and was installed as Governor of Edinburgh Castle.

== Early life ==
Born the son of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Selkirk and Anne, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton, Hamilton was commissioned into the His Majesty&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Foot, a regiment for which his uncle, Lord Dumbarton, held the colonelcy, on 9 May 1684.

== Military career ==

=== Ireland and the Low Countries ===
Hamilton became a lieutenant colonel of Lloyd&#x27;s Regiment of Enniskillen Foot in June 1689 and, having been promoted to brevet colonel, commanded the regiment at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, at the siege of Athlone in June 1691 and at the Battle of Aughrim, where he was wounded, in July 1691 during the Williamite War in Ireland. He also commanded the regiment at the siege of Limerick in October 1691 and then became colonel of the Royal Fusiliers in January 1692 before fighting with that regiment at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 in the Low Countries during the Nine Years&#x27; War. Rewarded with the colonelcy of the 1st Regiment of Foot in late 1692, he participated in further battles in Ireland before returning to the continent to fight at the Battle of Landen in July 1693 and at the siege of Namur, where he was wounded, in July 1695 during the latter stages of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

On 25 November 1695 Hamilton married Elizabeth Villiers, a favourite and perhaps former mistress of William III, and on 3 January 1696 he was created Earl of Orkney, Viscount Kirkwall, and Baron Dechmont in the Peerage of Scotland. Shortly thereafter he acquired the estates of Taplow Court and Cliveden. He became Governor of Virginia in 1698 but appears never to have visited the colony.

=== War of the Spanish Succession ===

Promoted to major general on 9 March 1702, Hamilton fought under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough at the siege of Stevensweert in October 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Promoted to lieutenant general on 1 January 1704, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle later that year. He led the final assault at the Battle of Blenheim attacking the village churchyard with eight battalions of men and then receiving the surrender of its French defenders in August 1704. After marching his column from the Moselle, he relieved the besieged city of Liège in June 1705.

Hamilton led a diversion at the Battle of Ramillies but turned the manoeuvre into a highly successful assault, from which he had to withdraw before leading the relentless pursuit of the defeated French troops in May 1706. He also took part in the Siege of Menin in July 1706 and then played a major role at the Battle of Oudenarde in July 1708. He also saw action at the passage of the Scheldt in November 1708, fought at the siege of Tournai in June 1709 and led the charge of fifteen infantry battalions in an extremely bloody assault on the French entrenchments at the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709. Promoted to general of foot in 1710, Hamilton was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire in 1711. He returned to the continent in 1712 and continued to serve in the Army commanded by the Duke of Ormonde besieging Douai and then Bouchain until 1713.

== Later life ==
Hamilton became a Lord of the Bedchamber to George I and was installed as Governor of Edinburgh Castle in 1714. He also sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer. Promoted to field marshal (the first-ever promotion to this rank) on 31 January 1735, he commissioned the building of a temple at his Buckinghamshire home, Cliveden, by the architect Giacomo Leoni later that year.

Hamilton died at his home at Albemarle Street in London on 29 January 1737 and was buried at Taplow Court. In 1733 Michael Rysbrack, a sculptor from Antwerp, carved a marble bust of Hamilton in the form of a Roman centurion. As a boy, Rysbrack would have witnessed Hamilton&#x27;s unopposed entry into Antwerp shortly after his victory at Ramillies. The bust is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
==Family==
In 1695 Hamilton married Elizabeth Villiers, a former mistress of William III; they had three daughters:
* Lady Anne, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Orkney, married William O&#x27;Brien, 4th Earl of Inchiquin
* Lady Frances, married Thomas Lumley-Saunderson, 3rd Earl of Scarbrough
* Lady Henrietta, married John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork and Orrery.

<doc id="407448" wikidata="Q827441" url="?curid=407448" title="Pterophyllum scalare">
<text>Pterophyllum scalare, most commonly referred to as angelfish or freshwater angelfish, is the most common species of &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; kept in captivity. It is native to the Amazon Basin in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. Particularly to the Ucayali river in Peru, the Oyapock River in French Guiana, the Essequibo River in Guyana, the Solimões, the Amapá, and the Amazon rivers in Brazil. It is found in swamps or flooded grounds where vegetation is dense and the water is either clear or silty. Its native waters range from a neutral pH of 7.0 down to near 6.0, with a general water hardness (gH) range of 3 to 10 °dH, and water temperature ranging from 26 to 30 °C (75 to 86 °F). This is the species of angelfish most frequently found in the aquarium trade. A similar (cross-breeding possible) &quot;P. scalare&quot; exists in the Rio Orinoco. They are of the same size and shape, the only difference being the stripes; the Orinoco &quot;P. scalare&quot; has thinner, but dual, stripes.

The diet of &quot;Pterophyllum scalare&quot; consists of a wide spectrum of prey; they feed on tiny fish fry and younger, juvenile fishes, young and mature shrimps, crabs, prawns, various worms, mosquito larvae, and water bugs. Additionally, they will opportunistically catch any smaller-sized floating insects that have fallen onto the surface of the water.

In captivity, these are not picky fish; They readily feed on different types of frozen, freeze-dried and live foods, such as tubifex worms, bean beetles (and larvae), bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, flour beetles, krill, springtails, small or finely-chopped earthworms, black soldier fly larvae and cultured wingless fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;). In particular, the tubifex worms and fruit flies are high in protein and nutrients, resulting in highly significant growth. A predominantly live food diet also provides nutrients for better reproductive performance. Ultimately, food variety is key, for health, but also for mimicking natural feeding habits.

First described by Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1823, First import to Europe (Germany) by C.Ziggelkow, Hamburg in 1909

The genome of the angelfish was sequenced and assembled by Indeever Madireddy, a high school student.

<doc id="407450" wikidata="Q335974" url="?curid=407450" title="John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll">
<text>Field Marshal John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, 1st Duke of Greenwich, (10 October 1680 – 4 October 1743), styled Lord Lorne from 1680 to 1703, was a Scottish nobleman and senior commander in the British Army. He served on the continent in the Nine Years&#x27; War and fought at the Siege of Kaiserswerth during the War of the Spanish Succession. He then went on to serve as a brigade commander during the later battles of the War of the Spanish Succession, and was subsequently given command of all British forces in Spain at the instigation of the Harley Ministry. After conducting a successful evacuation of the troops from Spain, he became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland. During the Jacobite Rebellion, he led the government army against the Jacobite forces led by the Earl of Mar at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. Afterwards he served as Lord Steward and then Master-General of the Ordnance under the Walpole–Townshend Ministry.

==Early life==
Born at Ham House, he was the son of Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll and Elizabeth Campbell (née Tollemache, daughter of Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet). His mother was a stepdaughter of John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale, a dominant figure in Scotland during Charles II&#x27;s reign. Five years after his birth, Campbell&#x27;s grandfather Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll led Argyll&#x27;s Rising against the rule of James II of England and VII of Scotland for which he was executed in Edinburgh in June 1685. Campbell was privately tutored first by Walter Campbell of Dunloskin, then by John Anderson of Dumbarton and, finally, by Alexander Cunningham.

==Early military career==
Campbell was commissioned, after his father had given William III some encouragement, as colonel of Lord Lorne&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, a regiment entirely raised by the Argyll family, on 7 April 1694. He served briefly on the European continent in the Nine Years&#x27; War before the regiment was disbanded in 1698. He also served under the Duke of Marlborough at the Siege of Kaiserswerth in April 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle later that year.

Campbell succeeded his father as Duke of Argyll and Chief of Clan Campbell in 1703, and also became colonel of the 4th Troop of Horse Guards and a privy councillor. For the help he gave the Queen persuading the Parliament of Scotland to support the Act of Union, he was created Earl of Greenwich and Baron Chatham in 1705. He then returned to the continent and, having been promoted to major-general early in 1706, served as a brigade commander under Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies in May 1706 and at the Siege of Ostend in June 1706. After being appointed colonel of Prince George of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment in 1707, he went on to command a brigade at the Battle of Oudenarde in July 1708 and at the Siege of Lille in Autumn 1708. Promoted to lieutenant general in April 1709, he also took part in the Siege of Tournai in June 1709 and the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709.

Appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter in December 1710, Campbell was promoted to full general and given command of all British forces in Spain at the instigation of the Harley Ministry in January 1711. He replaced James Stanhope who had been forced to surrender at Brihuega the previous December. The Harley government was negotiating an agreement with France which would see Britain recognise Philip V of Spain, in exchange for being allowed to retain Gibraltar and Minorca.

After conducting a successful evacuation of the troops from Spain he became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1712. By 1713, however, Campbell had become critical of the ministry, and he joined the Whig opposition in making speeches against the government&#x27;s policy on the Malt Tax. In July 1714, during Queen Anne&#x27;s last illness, Campbell gave his full support to the Hanoverian succession. He was rewarded with the colonelcy of the Royal Horse Guards in June 1715.

==Jacobite uprising==

During the Jacobite Rebellion, Campbell led the government army against the Jacobites led by the Earl of Mar at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in November 1715. The battle was indecisive but favoured the government strategically. He led the advance against the Jacobite capital of Perth, capturing it in December with little bloodshed, but was then replaced as commander by William Cadogan.

==Later career==
Campbell arrived back in London early in March 1716, and at first stood high in the king&#x27;s favour, but in a few months was stripped of his offices. This, however, did not deter him from the discharge of his parliamentary duties; he supported the bill for the impeachment of Bishop Atterbury, and lent his aid to his countrymen by opposing the bill for punishing the city of Edinburgh for the Porteous Riots. In the beginning of the year 1719 he was again admitted into favour, and in April was created Duke of Greenwich.

He went on to become Lord Steward of the Household in 1721 and then Master-General of the Ordnance in June 1725 under the Walpole–Townshend Ministry. He also became colonel of the Queen&#x27;s Regiment of Horse in August 1726 and, having been appointed Governor of Portsmouth in November 1730, he was restored to the colonelcy of the Royal Horse Guards in August 1733.

In the 1720s he commissioned the architect James Gibbs to design a Palladian house at Sudbrook Park close to his birthplace at Ham House.

Promoted to field marshal on 31 January 1735, Campbell was stripped of his post as Master-General of the Ordnance and the colonelcy of the Royal Horse Guards for opposing the Government of Robert Walpole in 1740. However he was restored to his post as Master-General of the Ordnance in February 1741 and restored to his colonelcy a few days later. However, disapproving the measures of the new administration, and apparently disappointed at not being given the command of the army, he shortly resigned all his posts, and spent the rest of his life in privacy and retirement.

Campbell died at Sudbrook Park, Petersham on 4 October 1743 and was buried in Westminster Abbey; his grave is marked by a small lozenge stone to the north east of Henry VII&#x27;s tomb. A large monument, designed by the French sculptor, Louis-François Roubiliac, was erected for him in the south transept and unveiled in 1749.

Argyll Street in London&#x27;s West End is named after him.

==Family==

Campbell married first, Mary Brown, daughter of John Brown and Ursula Duncombe, in 1701: they separated soon after the marriage and she died in 1717 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He married in 1717 secondly, Jane Warburton, daughter of Thomas Warburton and Anne Williams, sister of Hugh Warburton and maid of honour to Queen Anne; Jane died in 1767 and was buried with him in Westminster Abbey. He had four daughters who reached maturity: Caroline Townshend, 1st Baroness Greenwich, Lady Elizabeth Campbell, Lady Anne Campbell and Lady Mary Coke.

==In popular culture==
Campbell is played by James Robertson Justice in the 1953 film &quot;Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue&quot;. He is played by Andrew Keir in Michael Caton-Jones&#x27;s &quot;Rob Roy&quot;.

During this engagement the entire French fleet, under the command of the Marquis de Château-Renault, together with the Spanish galleons and transports under Manuel de Velasco, were either captured or destroyed. He also took part in a successful raid on Barcelona three years later. He went on to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Irish Army throughout the 1720s and 1730s.

==Military career==

===Early career===

Born the son of Richard Boyle (born circa 1640) and Elizabeth Boyle (née Ponsonby, daughter of Sir John Ponsonby of Bessborough), Boyle was educated at the University of Oxford. He started his military career as a volunteer in the service of the Duke of Ormonde at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690 during the Williamite War in Ireland. He also fought, being wounded and becoming a prisoner of war, at the Battle of Landen in July 1693 during the Nine Years&#x27; War. He was commissioned as a junior officer in Ormonde&#x27;s Troop of Horse Guards and cornet in the Army on 16 February 1694 and was promoted to cornet in his regiment and major in the Army in 1697.

Boyle succeeded his paternal grandfather as 2nd Viscount Shannon of the Peerage of Ireland in 1699. He became colonel of Prince George of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment of Marines in February 1702 and commanded a brigade of grenadiers during the storming of Vigo in October 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. During this engagement the entire French fleet, under the command of the Marquis de Château-Renault, together with the Spanish galleons and transports under Manuel de Velasco, were either been captured or destroyed. For his good conduct at Vigo, Boyle was sent home to present the despatches, which reported on the destruction of the French fleet, to Queen Anne. She rewarded him with a gratuity of £1,000. However, in January 1703 he was accused of being involved in some scandalous activity at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly.

Promoted to brigadier-general in 1704, Boyle took part in a successful raid on Barcelona in 1705; he was again sent home to present the despatches. Queen Anne rewarded him with another gratuity. Promoted to major-general in 1708, he became Joint Controller for Clothing the Army that year. He also entered the House of Commons in 1708 as Member of Parliament (MP) for Arundel. His brief membership of the Kit-Cat Club, which met at the Trumpet tavern in London, gave him useful access to ministers and other key influencers including the Earl of Scarborough who had nominated him as a candidate for his seat in Parliament. At this time he was said to have had &quot;an openness and frankness in his conversation which are highly engaging&quot;. In Parliament he supported the Whigs and voted for the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708 which allowed Protestants fleeing from the continent to enter Great Britain.

Promoted to lieutenant general in 1709, Boyle became Deputy Governor of Dover Castle later that year and was then given command of a secret but abortive expedition to attack New France in 1710. As the Earl of Scarborough was no longer in a position to nominate both members for Arundel, Boyle changed constituency to Hythe for which seat he was nominated by Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, in 1710. In Parliament, in accordance with Whig party policy, he voted for the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a clergyman who had criticised the party, in March 1710.

===Later career===

Boyle became colonel of the Viscount Shannon&#x27;s Regiment of Foot in January 1715 and changed constituency again to East Grinstead later that year. He joined the army staff in Ireland in 1716.

Boyle became Commander-in-Chief, Ireland in 1720 and retained that command for the rest of his life. In June 1721 Richard Waring sold the colonelcy of the King&#x27;s Regiment of Carabineers to Boyle for £7,500. Boyle also became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1721 and one of the Lord Justices in Ireland in 1722. Awarded the Freedom of the City of Cork in 1722, he was ousted from his seat in Parliament as a result of a petition but regained his seat again in a by-election later that year.

Boyle became colonel of the 4th Troop of Horse Guards in March 1727 and was promoted to general of horse on 18 December 1735. He became Governor of Portsmouth in 1737 before being promoted to field marshal on 17 July 1739.

Boyle died at his home, Ashley Park at Walton-on-Thames, on 20 December 1740, and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church in Walton-on-Thames. There is a monument to him in the church.

==Family==
On 6 June 1704, Boyle married Mary Sackville, illegitimate daughter of Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset and widow of Lionel Boyle, 3rd Earl of Orrery, who died twelve years later, bearing no children. In January 1720, Boyle remarried, this time to Grace Senhouse, daughter of John Senhouse of Netherhall in Cumbria; they had one child, Grace Sackville, Countess of Middlesex.

<doc id="407463" wikidata="Q5215412" url="?curid=407463" title="Dances of Universal Peace">
<text>The Dances of Universal Peace (DUP) are a spiritual practice that employs singing and dancing the sacred phrases of the world&#x27;s religions. Their intention is to raise consciousness and promote peace between diverse religions according to one stated goal. The DUP are of North American Sufic origin. They combine chants from many world faiths with dancing, whirling, and a variety of movement with singing.

==Format==
Five to 500 dancers stand in a circle, often around a leader and musicians with acoustic instruments in the center. All dances are participatory and spectating is somewhat discouraged because joy is the goal, as opposed to the technical performance of specified dance steps or forms. Dances are facilitated by a dance leader who often plays a drum, guitar, flute or other stringed instrument. For lyrics, dances borrow inspirational poetry, quotes and chants which are sung as the dance is performed. Chants are often sacred phrases put to traditional, contemporary, or occasionally improvised melodies. A wide range of languages are deliberately employed including Arabic, Aramaic, English, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Persian, and Sanskrit. Dance promoters use diverse religious practices, chants and languages to demonstrate how joy lives at the heart of every religion. Dance leaders tend to believe peace can be promoted through experiencing the same One Joy through diverse dance steps, chants, and languages.

The DUP emphasis is on participation regardless of ability as DUP dances are almost never performed before an audience. Dancers of all levels, including children, are able to follow along and dance together. Each dance is taught afresh at each gathering. Dances and dancing of this kind is seen as opportunity to develop participants&#x27; spiritual awareness, hand-eye-body coordination, and competency in harmonizing with others through dance. Many dances are choreographed with movements, steps, and gestures encouraging dancers to explore for deeper mystical meanings of the dance.

==History==
The Dances of Universal Peace were first formulated by Samuel L. Lewis (Sufi Ahmed Murad Chisti). The very first dance took place on 16 March, 1968 in San Francisco, California. The original dances were strongly influenced by Samuel Lewis&#x27; spiritual relationships with Ruth St. Denis, a modern dance pioneer, and Hazrat Inayat Khan, a Sufi master. The influence on the dances of Sufi practices such as Sema and The Whirling Dervishes are apparent, although Samuel Lewis was also a Rinzai Zen master and drew on the teachings of various religious and spiritual traditions.

Dances were originally performed at camps and meetings with a distinctly New Age and alternative feel but have increasingly been offered in diverse places of worship and more secular places such as schools, colleges, prisons, hospices, residential homes for those with special needs, and holistic health centers. The therapeutic uses of the Dances as well as the walking meditations developed by Samuel Lewis have also been explored in various settings. The Dances have developed into a global movement due to the work of the International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace founded in 1982 by Neil Douglas-Klotz and Tasnim Fernandez, who at that time were teachers in the Sufi Ruhaniat International and Sufi Order International respectively. Both have continued to be leading exponents of the Dances and Douglas-Klotz&#x27;s creation of Dances using Aramaic words of Jesus has entered many alternative and mainstream religious circles. The Network has members in 28 countries.

<text>A signing bonus or sign-on bonus is a sum of money paid to a new employee (including a professional sports person) by a company as an incentive to join that company. They are often given as a way of making a compensation package more attractive to the employee (e.g., if the annual salary is lower than they desire). It can also lower risk to the employer compared with a higher salary; for example, if the employee does not meet expectations. Signing bonuses are often used in professional sports, and to recruit graduates into their first jobs.

To encourage employees to stay at the organization, there are often clauses in the contract whereby if the employee quits before a specified period, they must return the signing bonus. In sports contracts, the full amount of signing bonuses is not always paid immediately, but spread out over time. In such cases, the main difference between a signing bonus and base salary is that the former is &quot;guaranteed&quot; money meaning the team is required to pay the bonus when due even if it cuts the player, unless the player retires or the contract is otherwise terminated due to a significant breach on the part of the player.

As of March 2019, Aaron Rodgers had received the highest signing bonus in National Football League history, at $57.5 million. As of July 2023, Paul Skenes had received the largest signing bonus in Major League Baseball draft history, at $9.2 million.

<doc id="407469" wikidata="Q921088" url="?curid=407469" title="Doshisha University">
<text>, also referred to as , is a private university in Kyoto, Japan. Established in 1875, it is one of Japan&#x27;s oldest private institutions of higher learning, and has approximately 30,000 students enrolled on four campuses in Kyoto. It is one of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Global 30&quot; universities and a member of , a group of four leading private universities in western Japan&#x27;s Kansai region, along with Kansai University, Kwansei Gakuin University, and Ritsumeikan University.

== History ==

Doshisha University was founded in 1875 as Doshisha English School by Protestant educator , as a school to advance Christian education in Japan. As a young man, Niijima left Japan for the United States in 1864, despite the ban on overseas travel then imposed on Japanese nationals. He studied at Phillips Academy and Amherst College, and returned to Japan in 1874. The next year, Niijima established the Doshisha School. Niijima served as president of the university from 1875 to 1890. Other early university presidents included educator and author Yamamoto Kakuma (1890–1892), Seito Saibara (1899–1902), who was the first Christian member of the Japanese Diet, Kenkichi Kataoka (1902–1904), and prominent chemical engineer Kotaro Shimomura (1904–1907). Tokio Yokoi, Tasuku Harada, and Ebina Danjo were also presidents.

By 1920, Doshisha was granted university status and developed into a full-fledged university in the Anglo-American academic tradition. During World War II, its buildings were given Japanese names and its curriculum was stripped of its pro-Western elements. The prewar conditions were restored after the surrender of Japan. The first graduate degree programs were instituted in 1953.

Amherst College has maintained a close relationship with Doshisha University, and since 1972, Doshisha has collaborated with a consortium of American liberal arts colleges including Amherst to host the Associated Kyoto Program, an 8-month long study abroad program offered every year to students from American colleges and universities. Doshisha also houses the Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies, another program affiliated with American universities and centered on advanced Japanese language training.

== Academics and admissions ==
Doshisha has graduate degree programs in Theology, Letters, Psychology, Business, Global Studies, Law, Economics, Commerce, Policy and Management, Culture and Information Science, Science and Engineering, Life and Medical Sciences, Health and Sports Science, and Social Studies.

The libraries at the Imadegawa and Kyotanabe campuses hold more than 2.5 million volumes.

=== Faculty ===
As of 2013, Doshisha University employs 777 full-time and 1,411 part-time faculty members across its Kyoto campuses. In terms of research, Doshisha has filed the 36th-highest number of patents in the nation.

== Campuses ==
Doshisha University has two main campuses at Imadegawa in central Kyoto and at Kyotanabe in southern Kyoto. Imadegawa is the main campus, located in the former residence of Satsuma Domain. It has been in use since the school was founded. Located in the center of Kyoto, the campus is situated next to Shōkoku-ji, overlooking Kyoto Imperial Palace. Five buildings in the Imadegawa campus have been designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan, including Doshisha Chapel and Clark Memorial Hall. This campus is primarily for the liberal arts, business (including a graduate school of business), theology, and law faculties. A large learning commons with over 40,000 square meters of space, the Ryoshinkan, was opened in 2012 and included the incorporation of Imadegawa Station, a station on the Karasuma Line of the Kyoto Municipal Subway.

The Kyotanabe Campus was opened in 1986, in Kyōtanabe, Kyoto and is part of Kansai Science City. Over 195 acres (0.79 km2) in area, it serves primarily as the campus for the science and engineering faculties. In 2012, a new Karasuma Campus was established approximately 300 meters from the Imadegawa Campus. The Karasuma Campus houses the International Education Institute, the Graduate School of Global Studies, and the Faculty of Global and Regional Studies.

== Student life ==

=== Societies ===
There are over 400 clubs and organizations at Doshisha University.

=== Festivals ===
* Doshisha Eve
* Doshisha Kyotanabe Festival
* Sports Festival

=== Athletics ===
* Doshisha is part of the Kansai Big Six Baseball League. The baseball team is known for their rivalry with Ritsumeikan University. 
* Doshisha&#x27;s rugby team has a long history, and had won 4 championships in All-Japan University Rugby Championship from 1980 to 1984. 
* The men&#x27;s basketball program is noted for its frequent participation in All Japan Intercollegiate Basketball Championship.

== Alumni ==
Doshisha is renowned for its strong connection to business in the Kansai region. According to the 2011 university rankings by Toyo Keizai, 533 alumni served as executives in listed companies. As of 2013, around 25.5% of undergraduates were able to enter one of the top 400 companies in Japan, which ranks eighth nationwide among all private institutions in Japan and first among private universities in Kansai.

Doshisha alumni include Takako Doi, the first female Lower House Speaker in Japan (the highest position a female politician has held in the country&#x27;s history); Abe Isoo, an early pacifist and feminist and member of the Japanese Diet; Japanese statesman Uchida Kosai, who twice served as acting prime minister; Japanese-language author David Zoppetti; Korean poet Yun Dong-ju; tea master Hansō Sōshitsu; and Gunpei Yokoi, creator of the Game Boy.

<doc id="407474" wikidata="Q2889722" url="?curid=407474" title="Stewart Culin">
<text>Robert Stewart Culin (July 13, 1858 – April 8, 1929) was an American ethnographer and author interested in games, art and dress. Culin played a major role in the development of ethnography, first concentrating his efforts on studying the Asian-Americans workers in Philadelphia. His first published works were &quot;The Practice of Medicine by the Chinese in America&quot; and &quot;China in America: A study in the social life of the Chinese in the eastern cities of the United States&quot;, both dated 1887. He believed that similarity in gaming demonstrated similarity and contact among cultures across the world.

==Early life==
Born Robert Stewart Culin, a son of Mina Barrett Daniel Culin and John Culin, in Philadelphia, Culin was schooled at Nazareth Hall. He entered his father&#x27;s mercantile business after graduating from high school. While he had no formal education in anthropology, Culin played a role in the development of the field. His interest began with the Asian-American population of Philadelphia, then composed chiefly of Chinese-American laborers.

Early ethnographic approach could predated to 1884, when Culin collected advertisements information in Philadelphia. 

His first published works were an 1887 article for a medical journal, &quot;The Practice of Medicine by the Chinese in America&quot; and his speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science on &quot;China in America : a study in the social life of the Chinese in the eastern cities of the United States&quot;. In 1889 Culin published a report about Chinese Dominoes and Dice. In 1890 he wrote an article about Italian marionettes was inspired by a visit to a marionette theater in New York City.

==World of games==
Active in several ethnographic organizations during the late 1880s, Culin became involved with the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago during 1893. As an assistant curator, Culin organized several game-related exhibitions. In addition, 1891 saw the publication of two papers. The first treated the street games of city boys, the second dealt with Chinese gambling games, providing explanations on Fan-Tan and Pak Kop Pin. At the World Exposition, Culin met Frank Hamilton Cushing. The two became friends and endeavored to create the first cumulative documentation on the world&#x27;s games.

In 1892 Culin became Director of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Museum of Archaeology and Paleontology. Married on March 18, 1893, to Helen Bunker, Culin published on the games exhibit at the 1891 Chicago exposition. In 1899 he became curator at the Free Museum of Science and Arts in Philadelphia on American and general ethnology.

&quot;Korean Games&quot;, with comparisons to those of other Asian cultures, were the topic of Culin&#x27;s first book, published in 1895. This work was inspired by Cushing, then of the Bureau of American Ethnology of Washington. Culin became interested in chess and card games and published a paper on the topic in 1886. He worked with Cushing on an article called &quot;Arrow games and their variants in America and the Orient&quot;. When Cushing became ill, Culin continued the work and eventually published three inter-related papers: &quot;American Indian Games&quot; (1898), &quot;Hawaiian Games&quot; (1899) and &quot;Philippine Games&quot; (1900). After Cushing&#x27;s death in 1900, Culin published a revised version of &quot;American Indian Games&quot; in 1903.

==Professional life==
Although he had no formal training, Robert Stewart Culin is known today as an expert on games as well as for his museum work. His influence was not limited to the two great institutions where he spent his career—the University of Pennsylvania and the Brooklyn Museum. Culin was also a founding member of both the American Anthropological Association and the American Folklore Society, and was an experienced collector and exhibitor who organized exhibitions at world&#x27;s fairs in Madrid (1892) and Chicago (1893). He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1897.

Culin&#x27;s collecting methodology in many ways exemplified the attitudes and assumptions of the heyday of anthropological collecting known as the &quot;museum age&quot; (1875–1925). His major focus was to understand the &quot;language of things&quot;, which resulted in innovative exhibitions and collaboration with several colleagues, especially in the worlds of fashion and design. He was a meticulous record keeper whose exhaustive documentation practices, unique to museums today, created a level of documentation that set standards in the field. Culin endeavored to document both the meanings and the origins of the objects he collected.

Culin began his career by studying the life and culture of Chinese Americans in Philadelphia. During the 1890s, while employed at the University of Pennsylvania, he turned his attention to Native American culture. After resigning from the university in 1903, Culin was appointed Curator of the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s newly established Department of Ethnology. Under the parentage of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (founded 1890), the museum was about to embark on a new era, &quot;building up great ethnological collections, sending out expeditions for the acquiring of antiquities, first over all America, then over the entire world&quot;.

Culin immediately set out on a series of field trips through the Southwest, California, and the Northwest Coast. By 1911, he had collected more than nine thousand Native American objects and acquired or created an astonishing level of attendant documentation. Believing that he had collected everything necessary to represent Native Americans, he turned his interests to the cultures of Asia and finally Eastern Europe. Culin was concerned not only with finding and acquiring objects for the museum, but also with documenting the maker, the social position of the seller, the circumstances of purchase, the provenance, the use of the object, and the cultural life of the region. Thus, the collection includes information on the cultural and historical context of objects, as seen through Culin&#x27;s eyes. Like his colleagues, what Culin collected and decided not to collect (both of which are documented here) are important parameters in the history of cultural representation in museums. His opinions and biases are evident throughout the collection.

Culin amassed an extensive research collection, including correspondence, manuscripts (his own and those of others), reports, publications, and clippings. A full visual record complementing the written documentation includes photographs, sketches, watercolors, oil paintings, postcards, and other illustrative study material. The depth and range of the information available in the Culin Archival Collection make it a critical resource for the study of cultural anthropology, art and cultural history, costume and textile design, ethnology, folklore, linguistics, museology, and photography on an international scale. The collection contains valuable information on the development of ethnology as a discipline, on the part played by museums in presenting and interpreting objects and cultures, and on the social and economic consequences, within native communities, of large-scale systematic collecting.

Reflecting Culin&#x27;s strong interest in Native American cultures, the Archives provides a vivid account of the circumstances under which he collected and of the individuals, native and non-native, who assisted him in the field. His intellectual exchanges with several of his colleagues, such as Franz Boas from the American Museum of Natural History, George Amos Dorsey at the Field Museum, and Frank Hamilton Cushing of the Bureau of American Ethnology, are evident in his extensive correspondence files. Textual and visual materials from Cushing form an important component of the Culin Archives. Cushing, who lived with the Zuni between 1879 and 1884, was a major influence on Culin&#x27;s choice of Zuni as his main collecting focus in the Southwest. Because of their close personal friendship, Culin acquired a large collection of sketches, photographs, and notes from Cushing&#x27;s estate; the accompanying correspondence between Culin and Cushing provides a detailed picture of their collaboration.

Culin was among the first curators to recognize the museum installation as an art form in itself and to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as mere specimens. He had a revolutionary interest in the interchange between museum curatorship and contemporary costume and textile designers. Through his close professional relationship with M. D. C. Crawford of &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; he brought the museum&#x27;s collections to the attention of the design community. Culin established a study room in the museum for designers to view the collections and organized traveling exhibitions for department stores around the country. The Crawford correspondence and writings are an important reflection of the evolution of a school of American design. Culin&#x27;s friendship with artists is also evident in the collection, which contains correspondence from Thomas Eakins and the designer Ruth Reeves, among others.

===The Culin Archive at the Brooklyn Museum===
In 1903, Culin resigned from the University of Pennsylvania and became curator of Ethnology at the Institute of Arts and Sciences of the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. He began a series of collection expeditions to study Native Americans in the Southwest and California. Culin accumulated a large body of artifacts in the course of his career. Meticulous in their description, Culin captured &quot;the maker, use of the object, social position of the seller, the circumstances of purchase, the provenance&quot;. He also exchanged letters with Franz Boas and George Amos Dorsey. In 1907 Culin unified his 14 years of theories and ideas in the work &quot;Games of North American Indians&quot;, using the categories games of skill and games of chance to organize the work.

After 1907, Culin became interested in decorative art such as costume, fashion, and furniture. Working with Women&#x27;s Wear Daily, he displayed contemporary fashion, changed museum rooms and created traveling exhibits to exhibit textiles and foster the study of design. As a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, Culin was instrumental in opening exhibits on the major cultures of the world. In the midst of a number of collecting expeditions to Africa, China, Japan and Europe, Culin married Alice Mumford Roberts in 1917.

From 1917 to 1928, Culin collected textiles and dresses from his trips to Eastern and Western Europe.

In the 1920s Culin made several collecting expeditions to Europe and published on Asian games, African games and European dress. Well known in the worlds of anthropology, ethnography and the fashion industry, Culin died in 1929 in Amityville, Long Island, New York.

== Criticism ==
With the focus on collecting and displaying materials as art, Culin obtained heritage objects without consent or built replicas of objects to serve as representation. As a result, his collections have faced legal restraints from the government on collecting cultural heritage objects while colleagues debate the topic of authenticity on replica materials. In 2019, The Brooklyn Museum concurred that five of the Culin&#x27;s collections should be returned to the original tribes under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.

<text>Vritti (Vrutti) (Sanskrit: वृत्ति, Harvard-Kyoto: vṛtti, Gujarati: વૃત્તિ), means &quot;streams of consciousness&quot;, it is also a technical term used in yoga with five specifically defined &quot;movements of thought&quot; which can both help or hinder us; cf. cittavṛtti. 

Outside of yoga, the scope of the idea is very broad, referring not only to thoughts and perceptions experienced when awake, dreaming, or asleep, but also to super-physical perceptions, as in any altered state of consciousness. Vritti has also been translated as &quot;waves&quot; or &quot;ripples&quot; of disturbance upon the otherwise calm waters of the mind. The classical definition of yoga as stated in the Yoga Sutras is to stop the growth of waves in the mind.

==Usage in yoga==
The concept of vritti is central to the main definition of yoga given in Sutra 1.2 of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: &quot;yogasch chitta vritti nirodha&quot;. I. K. Taimni translates this as: &quot;Yoga is the silencing of the modifications of the mind&quot;. Central to the definition of yoga is the concept of &quot;vritti&quot; as specific modifications of the mind, which it is the intent of yogic practices to silence. Vyāsa commented that it is not all movements of thought that must be restrained, only the five enumerated in the Yoga Sutra.

Swami Vivekananda uses the metaphor of a lake to illustrate this concept: “[Chitta] is the mind-stuff, and Vrttis are the waves and ripples rising in it when external causes impinge on it. The bottom of the lake we cannot see, because its surface is covered with ripples. It is only possible when the ripples have subsided, and the water is calm, for us to catch a glimpse of the bottom. If the water is muddy, the bottom will not be seen; if the water is agitated all the time, the bottom will not be seen. If the water is clear, and there are no waves, we shall see the bottom. That bottom of the lake is our own true Self; the lake is the Chitta, and the waves are the Vrttis.”

To stop waves, we have to create waves, thus in the Yoga Sutras (1:5) there are five vritti hinderous and helpful. 

These are: 
#Prāmana - literally &quot;the measure of&quot;, it is the movement of thought when we experience something directly, or (by inference) infer what an experience is like, or we hear an account of what it is like that is not falsified when experienced.
#Viparyaya - misapprehension of one thing for another, which is falsified when actually experienced. Replacing sugar with salt in a recipe for example.
#Vikalpah - verbal abstraction or imagination without an objective experience 
#Nidrā - waking continuum from distraction to oblivion to full sleep without the support of cognition
#Smrtayah - remembering both the material of experience and its cognition.

==According to Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati==
In the context of Hinduism and yoga, vrittis refer to different tendencies, or psycho-physical propensities, which give scope for the mind to express a variety of feelings and emotions. Hindu texts describe samskaras to be a result of past actions and experiences that have left an imprint on the mind. The expression of samskaras gives rise to vrittis, which collectively represent the behaviour that makes most people different from each other: difference in desires and repulsions; in predispositions and complexes.

==Connections made to modern science==
According to some modern descriptions, a vritti triggers the glands associated with that particular propensity to secrete the corresponding hormones. Usually this is done subconsciously, although yogis endeavour to control and master the expression of their vritties, through the practice of asanas (postures) and sadhana (meditation), leading to the attainment of siddhis (occult powers), and giving clear passage for the kundalini to rise.

Vrittis need not be considered confined to the esoteric experiences of advanced yogis. The seat of the vritti of love, or prema in Sanskrit, is the heart; the seat of the vritti of fear (bhaya) is the stomach. The sensation of feeling one&#x27;s heart swoon, or &quot;getting butterflies&quot; corresponds to the physical expression of these psychic propensities. Each vritti may have a negative or positive expression. Even love, when over-expressed, leads to intense possessiveness. The goal of the yogi is thus not to suppress, or annul their vrittis, rather it is to find a harmonious balance, and ultimately, to channelize these tendencies inward.

As a word, &quot;vritti&quot; means literally vortex (of consciousness), or &quot;circular activity with no beginning and no end&quot;.

==Vrittis of Tantric Chakras==
Below are the Vrittis associated with each of the Tantric Chakras:
# Muladhara: greatest joy, natural pleasure, delight in controlling passion, and blissfulness in concentration.
# Swadhisthana: affection, pitilessness, feeling of all-destructiveness, delusion, disdain and suspicion.
# Manipura: spiritual ignorance, thirst, jealousy, treachery, shame, fear, disgust, delusion, foolishness and sadness.
# Anahata: lustfulness, fraudulence, indecision, repentance, hope, anxiety, longing, impartiality, arrogance, incompetency, discrimination and defiance.
# Vishuddha: communication, calmness, purity, a melodious voice, and the command of speech and mantras.
# Ajna:centre of spiritual energy between the two eyebrows.
# Sahasrara:centre of spiritual energy at the crown of the head.

<doc id="407478" wikidata="Q1152190" url="?curid=407478" title="Ritsumeikan University">
<text>is a private university in Kyoto, Japan, that traces its origin to 1869. In addition to its main campus in Kyoto, the university also has satellite campuses in Ibaraki, Osaka and Kusatsu, Shiga.

Today, Ritsumeikan University is known as one of Western Japan&#x27;s most prestigious universities, part of the &quot;Kan-Kan-Do-Rits&quot; 関関同立 (Kwansei Gakuin University, Kansai University, Doshisha University, and Ritsumeikan University) abbreviation that refers to the four leading private universities in the Keihanshin region.

Ritsumeikan University is known for its Social Sciences, particularly International Relations (IR), as well as its Science &amp; Engineering departments, with the Graduate School of International Relations being the only Japanese member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs.

== History ==
Ritsumeikan was first founded as a private academy in 1869 by Prince Saionji Kinmochi. In 1900, Kojuro Nakagawa (the former secretary of Prince Saionji) established the Kyoto Hosei School, a law school that eventually adopted the Ritsumeikan name (with the prince&#x27;s permission) and was awarded full university status in 1922. Historically, the school was seen as a liberal alternative to the state-run Kyoto University.

The name &quot;Ritsumeikan&quot; comes from a Mencius quotation:
Some die young, as some live long lives. This is decided by fate. Therefore, one&#x27;s duty consists of cultivating one&#x27;s mind during this mortal span and thereby &quot;establishing one&#x27;s destiny&quot;. (in Japanese, 立命, &quot;ritsumei&quot;)

The &quot;kan&quot; in addition to &quot;ritsumei&quot; signifies a building.

== Colleges and graduate schools (by campus) ==

=== Kinugasa Campus (KIC) ===



In Kita-ku, Kyoto, this liberal arts-oriented campus is a roughly five-minute walk from Ryōan-ji and Kinkaku-ji temples. The campus has eight graduate schools, 17,000 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students. The ovarall design of the Kinugasa Campus was designed by Hiroyasu Tomiie, who was a leading Japanese modernist architect.

<doc id="407480" wikidata="Q4580104" url="?curid=407480" title="Grout">
<text>Grout is a dense substance that flows like a liquid yet hardens upon application, and it gets used to fill gaps or to function as reinforcement in existing structures. Grout is generally a mixture of water, cement, and sand, and it frequently gets employed in efforts such as pressure grouting, embedding rebar in masonry walls, connecting sections of precast concrete, filling voids, and sealing joints such as those between tiles. Common uses for grout in the household include filling in tiles of shower floors and kitchen tiles. It is often color tinted when it has to be kept visible and sometimes includes fine gravel when being used to fill large spaces (such as the cores of concrete blocks). Unlike other structural pastes such as plaster or joint compound, correctly mixed and applied grout forms a water-resistant seal.
Although both grout and its close relative, mortar, are applied as a thick suspension and harden over time, grout is distinguished by its low viscosity and lack of lime (added to mortar for pliability); grout is thin so it flows readily into gaps, while mortar is thick enough to support not only its own weight, but also that of masonry placed above it. Grout is also similar to concrete, but grout is distinguished by having only very fine aggregate (sand) and by generally containing a higher ratio of water to achieve the low desired viscosity.

The materials &quot;caulk&quot; and &quot;grout&quot; may be confused for each other or otherwise subject to misunderstandings. While each are used in building maintenance to a significant degree, the former is usually made up of a fluid silicone or polyurethane type of chemical substance while the latter consists of a specific mixture based on many fine particles, with the aforementioned household use of grout relying on its basis in cement being important. In addition, caulk remains flexible after it dries, which contrasts with the utilization of grout. Projects involving a lot of work involving grout frequently take place with the goals of preventing both dirt and moisture from getting under tiles.

==Varieties==
Grout varieties include tiling, flooring, resin, nonshrinking, structural, and thixotropic grouts. The use of enhancing admixtures increases the quality of cement-based materials and leads to greater uniformity of hardened properties.
Tiling grout is often used to fill the spaces between tiles or mosaics and to secure tile to its base. Although ungrouted mosaics do exist, most have grout between the tesserae. Tiling grout is also cement-based, and is produced in sanded and unsanded varieties, which affects the strength, size, and appearance of the grout. The sanded variety contains finely ground silica sand; unsanded is finer and produces a smoother final surface. They are often enhanced with polymers and/or latex.
Structural grout is often used in reinforced masonry to fill voids in masonry housing reinforcing steel, securing the steel in place, and bonding it to the masonry. Nonshrinking grout is used beneath metal bearing plates to ensure a consistent bearing surface between the plate and its substrate, which adds stability and allows for higher load transfers.
Portland cement is the most common cementing agent in grout. However, the utilization of thermoset polymer matrix grouts based on thermosets such as urethanes and epoxies are also popular.
Portland cement-based grouts include different varieties depending on the particle size of the ground clinker used to make the cement, with a standard size around 15 microns, microfine from 6–10 microns, and ultrafine below 5 microns. Finer particle sizes let the grout penetrate more deeply into a fissure. Because these grouts depend on the presence of sand for their basic strength, they are often somewhat gritty when finally cured and hardened. 
From the different types of grout, a suitable one has to be chosen depending on the load. For example, a load up to 7.5 tons can be expected for a garage access [two-component pavement joint mortar (traffic load)], whereas a cobbled garden path is only designed for a pedestrian load [one-component pavement joint mortar (pedestrian load)]. Furthermore, various substructures determine whether the type of grout should be permanently permeable to water or waterproof, for example, by concrete subfloor.

==Tools and treatments==
Tools associated with groutwork include:
*A grout saw or grout scraper is a manual tool for removal of old and discolored grout. The blade is usually composed of tungsten carbide.
*A grout float is a trowel-like tool for smoothing the surface of a grout line, typically made of rubber or soft plastic
*Grout sealer is a water-based or solvent-based sealant applied over dried grout that resists water, oil, and acid-based contaminants.
*Grout cleaner is a basic cleaning solution that is applied on grout lines and removes the dirt and dust.
*A die grinder is used for faster removal of old grout compared to a standard grout saw.
*A pointing trowel is used for applying grout in flagstone and other stone works.
*A multi-tool (power tool) is another option for removing tile grout between tiles when fitted with a specified diamond blade.
*A grout clean-up bucket is a professional clean-up kit for faster grout washup. It consists of a specialised bucket on rollers with a sponge.

<text>The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) is a government agency of the State of Maryland that performs a number of functions, including the operation of state prisons. It has its headquarters in an unincorporated area of Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, with a Baltimore address. There are additional offices in Sykesville.

==Administration==
The headquarters were previously in Towson.

===Organizational units===
Some of the agencies contained within the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services include:
* Criminal Injuries Compensation Board
* Division of Capital Construction and Facilities Maintenance
* Division of Correction
* Division of Parole and Probation
* Division of Pretrial Detention and Services (operates the former Baltimore City Jail - now the Baltimore City Detention Center and the pre-trial release programs in the city of Baltimore)
* Emergency Number Systems Board
* Handgun Permit Review Board
* Inmate Grievance Office
* Internal Investigative Division
* Information Technology and Communications Division
* Maryland Correctional Enterprises
* Maryland Parole Commission
* Office of the Inspector General
* Office of Planning, Policy, Regulations, and Statistics
* Office of the Secretary
* Police and Correctional Training Commissions
* Public Information Office
* Sundry Claims Board

==Facilities==


===Closed facilities===
* Herman L. Toulson Correctional Facility - Jessup
* Jessup Pre-Release Unit - Jessup
* Maryland House of Correction - Jessup
* Brockbridge Correctional Facility - Jessup

===Proposed facilities===
* New Youth Detention Facility (Baltimore City)
* New Women&#x27;s Detention Facility (Baltimore City)

== Death row ==
The &quot;Death Row&quot; for men was in the North Branch Correctional Institution in Western Maryland&#x27;s Cumberland area. The execution chamber is in the Metropolitan Transition Center (the former Maryland Penitentiary). The five men who were on the State&#x27;s &quot;death row&quot; were moved in June 2010 from the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center. In December 2014, former Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley commuted the sentences of all Maryland death row inmates to life sentences.

== Black Guerrilla Family ==
In 2009, a federal indictment under the RICO Act charges that the Black Guerrilla Family gang was active in a number of facilities, including North Branch Correctional Institution, Western Correctional Institution, Eastern Correctional Institution, Roxbury Correctional Institution, Maryland Correctional Institution – Jessup, Maryland Correctional Institution – Hagerstown, Baltimore City Correctional Center, and Metropolitan Transition Center, and the Baltimore City Detention Center (formerly and also known as the Baltimore City Jail).

The gang had a statewide &quot;supreme commander&quot; as well as subordinate commanders in each facility. These leaders were assisted by other gang officials dubbed ministers of intelligence, justice, defense and education. These organizations enforced a code of conduct and smuggled contraband into the facilities.

Another prison gang, this one of mostly white prisoners, known as &quot;D.M.I.&quot; Dead Man Incorporated was founded in Maryland prisons in 2001 or 2002 as an offshoot of the Black Guerrilla Family.

== Fallen officers ==
Since the establishment of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, five officers have died while on duty.

<doc id="407483" wikidata="Q471406" url="?curid=407483" title="Elias Ashmole">
<text>Elias Ashmole (23 May 1617 – 18 May 1692) was an English antiquary, politician, officer of arms, astrologer, freemason and student of alchemy. Ashmole supported the royalist side during the English Civil War, and at the restoration of Charles II he was rewarded with several lucrative offices.

Ashmole was an antiquary with a strong Baconian leaning towards the study of nature. His library reflected his intellectual outlook, including works on English history, law, numismatics, chorography, alchemy, astrology, astronomy and botany. Although he was one of the founding Fellows of the Royal Society, a key institution in the development of experimental science, his interests were antiquarian and mystical as well as scientific. He was an early freemason, although the extent of his involvement and commitment is unclear. Throughout his life he was an avid collector of curiosities and other artefacts. Many of these he acquired from the traveller, botanist and collector John Tradescant the Younger. Ashmole donated most of his collection, his antiquarian library and priceless manuscripts to the University of Oxford to create the Ashmolean Museum, Britain&#x27;s first public museum.

==Solicitor, royalist and freemason==
Ashmole was born on 23 May 1617 in Breadmarket Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire. His family had been prominent, but their fortunes had declined by the time of Ashmole&#x27;s birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy Coventry draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a Baron of the Exchequer. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a saddler who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias attended Lichfield Grammar School (now King Edward VI School) and became a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1633, he went to live in London as mentor to Paget&#x27;s sons, and in 1638, with James Paget&#x27;s help, he qualified as a solicitor. He enjoyed a successful legal practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a &quot;déclassé&quot; Cheshire aristocratic family, who died while pregnant only three years later on 6 December 1641. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken the first steps towards status and wealth. He also became allied with Major-General Charles Worsley (who died 12 June 1656 and was buried at Westminster Abbey), brother-in-law of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who married John Booth of Salford.

Ashmole supported the side of Charles I in the Civil War. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, Peter Mainwaring of Smallwood, Cheshire. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed King&#x27;s Commissioner of Excise at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, at the suggestion of George Wharton, a leading astrologer with strong court connections, Ashmole was given a military post at Oxford, where he served as an ordnance officer for the King&#x27;s forces. In his spare time, he studied mathematics and physics at his lodgings, Brasenose College. There he acquired a deep interest in astronomy, astrology and magic. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at Worcester. He was given the additional military post of captain in Lord Astley&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, part of the Royalist Infantry, though as a mathematician, he was seconded to artillery positions. He seems never to have participated in any actual fighting.

After the surrender of Worcester to the Parliamentary Forces in July 1646, he retired to Cheshire. Passing through Lichfield on his way there, he learnt that his mother had died just three weeks before from the plague. During this period, he was admitted as a freemason. His diary entry for 16 October 1646 reads in part: &quot;I was made a Free Mason at Warrington in Lancashire, with Coll: Henry Mainwaring of Karincham [Kermincham] in Cheshire.&quot; Although there is only one other mention of masonic activity in his diary, he seems to have remained in good standing and well connected with the fraternity as he was still attending meetings in 1682. On 10 March that year he wrote: &quot;About 5 H: P.M. I received a Sumons to appeare at a Lodge to held the next day, at Masons Hall London.&quot; The following day, 11 March 1682, he wrote: &quot;Accordingly, I went ... I was the Senior Fellow among them (it being 35 yeares since I was admitted) ... We all dyned at the halfe Moone Taverne in Cheapeside, at a Noble Dinner prepaired at the charge of the New-accepted Masons.&quot; Ashmole&#x27;s notes are one of the earliest references to Freemasonry known in England, but apart from these entries in his autobiographical notes, there are no further details about his involvement.

==Wealthy collector==

In 1646–47, Ashmole made several simultaneous approaches to rich widows in the hope of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife&#x27;s family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride&#x27;s family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and alimony but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary&#x27;s first husband&#x27;s estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.

During the 1650s, Ashmole devoted a great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he published &quot;Fasciculus Chemicus&quot; under the anagrammatic pseudonym &quot;James Hasolle&quot;. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, &quot;Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum&quot;, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole&#x27;s two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He appears to have been a collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner. He referred to himself as the son of William Backhouse, who adopted him in 1651 as his spiritual son—for the connection he gave him to the long spiritual chain of hermetic wisdom that Backhouse was part of. According to Ashmole, Backhouse &quot;intytle[d] me to some small parte Of grand sire Hermes wealth [sic]&quot;. His final alchemical publication was &quot;The Way to Bliss&quot; in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. &quot;The Way to Bliss&quot; recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.

Ashmole met the botanist and collector John Tradescant the Younger around 1650. Tradescant had, with his father, built up a vast and renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities from around the world at their house in Lambeth. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the &quot;Musaeum Tradescantianum&quot;. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant&#x27;s death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in Chancery in Ashmole&#x27;s favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole&#x27;s determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero&#x27;s legacy for his own glorification.

==Restoration==
Ashmole embarked on further catalogues, including one of the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 after eight years of work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole&#x27;s progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole&#x27;s loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for a large portion of the King&#x27;s revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of patronage.

The King commissioned Ashmole to prepare a catalogue of the coins and medals held in the Royal Collection, and appointed him to lead a commission responsible for tracing items from the collection which had been dispersed or sold by the parliamentary regime. Ashmole also appears to have been involved in the organisation of the coronation, or at least set himself up as an expert upon it.

Ashmole became one of the founding Fellows of the Royal Society in 1661, but he was not very active in the society. His most significant appointment was to the College of Arms as Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary in June 1660. In this position he devoted himself to the study of the history of the Order of the Garter, which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and he proposed a design for the Royal Society&#x27;s coat of arms.

By 1665, he was collecting information for his county history, &quot;The Antiquities of Berkshire&quot;; and in 1672 he published &quot;The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter&quot;, a lavish folio with illustrations by Wenceslaus Hollar, for which he had conducted years of research. An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the King of Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and the Elector Palatine. Ashmole performed the heraldic and genealogical work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and ceremony.

On 1 April 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and on 3 November the same year Ashmole married Elizabeth Dugdale (1632–1701), the much younger daughter of his friend and fellow herald, the antiquarian Sir William Dugdale. All of Elizabeth&#x27;s pregnancies ended in stillbirths or miscarriages, and Ashmole remained childless. In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms. He was offered the post of Garter Principal King of Arms, which traditionally came with a knighthood, but he turned it down in favour of Dugdale.

Ashmole possessed his own coat of arms, to which he proved his entitlement by descent from armigerous ancestors, expressed in heraldic terminology as &quot;Quarterly, Gules and Or a Fleur de lis Argent in the first quarter&quot; with &quot;a Greyhound courant&quot; for the crest. After the Restoration, Ashmole was granted a new crest in place of the greyhound, one which reflected his interest in astrology: &quot;On a wreath Sable and Or the Planet Mercury collocated in the middle of the caelestiall Signe Gemini Proper his right hand extended toward Heaven and left holding a caducan Rod Or&quot;. The new grant also altered the tinctures of his arms to &quot;Quarterly Sable and Or a Fleur de lis in the first quarter&quot;.

The Restoration led to the re-establishment of the Church of England, and Ashmole presented new prayer books to Lichfield Cathedral. In 1684, Dugdale wrote to his son-in-law that &quot;the vulgar sort of people&quot; were not &quot;yet weaned from the presbyterian practises, which was long prayers of their own devising, and senseless sermons&quot;. Like many royalists, Ashmole&#x27;s circle was contemptuous of non-conformity. Though Ashmole was &quot;one of the earliest Freemasons, [and] appears from his writings to have been a zealous Rosicrucian&quot;, John Gadbury wrote that &quot;Anthony Wood hath falsely called him a Rosicrucian, Whereas no man was further from fostring such follies.&quot; Ashmole&#x27;s involvement with Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism may have been social or the interest of an antiquarian, rather than born out of any religious fervour. However, the notion of a repository of universal knowledge is described in Rosicrucian writings and this idea may have partly inspired Ashmole&#x27;s desire to found a great museum.

==Ashmolean Museum==

In 1669, Ashmole received a Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Oxford. He maintained his links with the University and, in 1677, Ashmole made a gift of the Tradescant Collection, together with material he had collected independently, to the University on the condition that a suitable home be built to house the materials and make them available to the public. Ashmole had already moved into the house adjacent to the Tradescants&#x27; property in 1674 and had already removed some items from their house into his. In 1678, in the midst of further legal wrangling over the Tradescant Collection, Hester was found drowned in a garden pond. By early 1679, Ashmole had taken over the lease of the Tradescant property and began merging his and their collections into one. The Ashmolean Museum was completed in 1683, and is considered by some to be the first truly public museum in Europe. According to Anthony Wood, the collection filled twelve wagons when it was transferred to Oxford. It would have been more, but a large part of Ashmole&#x27;s own collection, destined for the museum, including antiquities, books, manuscripts, prints, and 9,000 coins and medals, was destroyed in a disastrous fire in the Middle Temple on 26 January 1679. As a result of the fire, the proportion of the collection derived from the Tradescants was larger than originally anticipated and in the opinion of Professor Michael Hunter this misfortune has contributed to criticisms that Ashmole took an unfair share of the credit in assembling the collection at the expense of the Tradescants.

In 1678, Ashmole stood as a candidate in a by-election for the Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency caused by the death of one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole&#x27;s campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole&#x27;s own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward as a candidate in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (in an age when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King&#x27;s candidate, and only as a result of this ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.

Ashmole&#x27;s health began to deteriorate during the 1680s. He continued to hold his excise office throughout the reign of James II and after the Glorious Revolution until his death but became much less active in affairs. His home cures included hanging three spiders around his neck which &quot;drove my Ague away&quot;. He began to collect notes on his life in diary form to serve as source material for a biography; although the biography was never written, these notes are a rich source of information on Ashmole and his times. He died at his house in Lambeth on 18 May 1692, and was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Lambeth on 26 May. Ashmole bequeathed the remainder of his collection and library to Oxford for the Ashmolean Museum. Two-thirds of his library now resides in the Bodleian at Oxford; its separation from the museum collection in the Victorian era contributed to the belief that Ashmole designed the museum around the Tradescant collection, rather than his own. Ashmole&#x27;s books can often be identified by the presence of his signature on the titlepages. Ashmole&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth, married a stonemason, John Reynolds, on 15 March 1694. They had no children and on her death seven years later the house and lands in Lambeth passed into Reynolds&#x27;s hands.

Vittoria Feola, in her monograph &quot;Elias Ashmole and the Uses of Antiquity&quot; (Paris, 2013), has described Ashmole as an antiquary first and foremost, who understood the value of the New Science, which he promoted through his Museum. Feola, however, has warned that antiquity was Ashmole&#x27;s greatest passion, as well as his main tool for self-fashioning. Michael Hunter, in his entry on Ashmole for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, concluded that the most salient points of Ashmole&#x27;s character were his ambition and his hierarchical vision of the world—a vision that unified his royalism and his interests in heraldry, genealogy, ceremony, and even astrology and magic. He was as successful in his legal, business and political affairs as he was in his collecting and scholarly pursuits. His antiquarian work is still considered valuable, and his alchemical publications, especially the &quot;Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum&quot; (1652), preserved many works that might otherwise have been lost. He formed several close and long-lasting friendships, with the astrologer William Lilly for example, but, as Richard Garnett observed, &quot;acquisitiveness was his master passion&quot;.

<text>Stars! is a turn-based strategy, science fiction 4X video game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate), originally developed by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride with help from Jeffrey Krauss (&quot;the Jeffs&quot;) for personal use, initially released as shareware for Microsoft Windows in 1995. A retail version was later produced for, and published by Empire Interactive, with developer Jason Gaston added to the team for quality assurance testing, although the shareware version continued.

The game focuses on players developing their empires, engaging in diplomacy, and conquering the galaxy. It begins with race design, and features 2D graphics and a grid-based battle system. The game is well-adapted to Play-By-Email and also supports AI opponents, blitz games, and duels. Stars! is compatible with most Windows versions and can run on Linux systems through Wine. While it received generally positive reviews for its depth and multiplayer focus, its complexity and single-player appeal were criticized. A sequel, Stars: Supernova Genesis, was abandoned due to lack of publisher interest.

==Gameplay==
Starting with a small fleet of ships and one or two planets, players develop their empires, meet other races and conquer the galaxy. &quot;Stars!&quot; games begin with race design, choosing one of 10 primary racial traits, a selection of lesser racial traits, habitability, growth, economic, and technology settings. The graphics are entirely 2D, and consist of the main map view and static pictures of planets, ship hulls and components. Battles consist of moving static icons around a grid. Because of the high level of micromanagement and diplomacy requirements, many games take place over months between players spread across the galaxy.

Players initially send scouts out to scan for suitable planets which later may be colonized and developed, enlarging the player&#x27;s empire and providing additional resources. As a player&#x27;s empire expands the player must balance the management of the population, minerals, research, and ship/infrastructure constructions. When other players&#x27; races are encountered, a variety of diplomacy options allow for alliances, trading mineral resources or technology, large-scale wars, and even the destruction of other races. If the random events game option is enabled, players will have to contend with (or take advantage of) the Mystery Trader, comet strikes, wormholes, and environmental changes.

===Modes of play===
The game is well adapted to the Play-By-Email (PBEM) style of multiplayer gaming. One player takes on duties as host, and the other players will send their instructions (turn files) by email to the host. The host then uses their copy of the game to generate the next turn, including the players&#x27; instructions and emails back the new game state file.

An alternative to play-by-email is to use an online system such as the Stars! AutoHost. This system automates most of the hosting duties and can handle a large number of games simultaneously.

Many games are run at a rate of one turn per calendar day, giving plenty of time for strategic thinking. In large games, this can be necessary, with turn generation dropping to only three times per week in cases due to the complexity of the game and the level of micro-management required to effectively control a large empire competitively. To foster a better understanding of the game, Mare Crisium paid members of the player community (Kearns, Clifford, Steeves) to write and edit an in-depth Strategy Guide in 1998.

There is also an artificial intelligence (AI) that can take part in the game. The player can opt to play against AIs only (up to 15 of them), and this is the way that new players typically get to learn the game mechanics before launching into multi-player games. A tutorial helps with getting started.

Another style of play is referred to as a Blitz game. In these games, turns are played every 15 minutes or so, and all players must be at their computers at the same time. Blitz games are generally more tactical and less political in nature, due to the time constraints involved.

The duel games are similar to regular turn-a-day ones, but are between two players only. Again, with only two players involved there is no political side to these games.

==Compatibility==
&quot;Stars!&quot; can be run on most versions of Windows from Windows 3.1 up. It can even be run on Linux systems through the Wine system. However, under Wine, version 2.70 crashes during combat if combat sounds are enabled. &quot;Stars!&quot; does not run directly on the 64-bit version of Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7, which cannot run 16-bit software. However, it can be played on a virtual machine-like Virtual Windows XP on Windows 7, or in VirtualPC on earlier 32-bit versions of windows. Another alternative is VirtualBox. It also runs quite well using Windows 3.11 installed in DOSBOX. Preview version (32bit) of Windows 10 plays version 2.60i. On 64-bit Windows 10, version 2.70i runs well on Wine for Windows version otvdm-v0.7.0.

==Development==
The game was originally developed in 1995, with version 2.0 released early in 1996. Later that year the newsgroup rec.games.computer.stars became active, facilitating public discussion of tactics and allowing players to find new games.

The game was originally developed by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride with help from Jeffrey Krauss (&quot;the Jeffs&quot;) for personal use, initially released as shareware for Microsoft Windows in 1995. A retail version was later produced for, and published by Empire Interactive, with developer Jason Gaston added to the team for quality assurance testing, although the shareware version continued.

By the end of 1996 shareware version 2.60 had been released, and the game has remained essentially unchanged ever since, although there have been numerous updates. Version 2.70 is the retail version which has battle sounds and allows research past Level 10 (the shareware version is restricted). The latest file date on the retail version CDROM is January 8, 1997; it sold for $41 before tax at Media Play in the southeastern U.S. in February 1997. The manual was 15mm thick (over half an inch), but the game only needed 2 MB of installation space. The most recent patch version, 2.60j RC4 (release candidate 4) was released in December 2000. Versions 2.60 and 2.70 are compatible as long as the minor version letter is the same (e.g.: 2.60i can play with 2.70i players). Over the years a number of third-party developers have provided tools and utilities to help players manage their empires.

==Reception==

&quot;Stars!&quot; has received some generally positive reviews. PC Gamer UK&#x27;s reviewer Andy Butcher gave the game a rating of 79% in its February 1997 issue, commending it with the following comment: &quot;What makes it stand out from the many games based on a similar idea are its depth, and that it&#x27;s been designed right from the start with multi-player gaming in mind&quot;. Pitfalls he mentions include that the large number of options available can make the game confusing, and that the game is likely to be less appealing to single players.

GameSpot&#x27;s reviewer T. Liam McDonald rated the game 7.3 &quot;Good&quot;, applauding &quot;a solid Windows interface, plain graphics, a wide range of custom options, deep strategic content, and compulsive playability&quot; and stating that the game outdoes the similar game Spaceward Ho! 4.0. In &quot;Computer Game Review&quot;, Tasos Kaiafas wrote, &quot;&quot;Stars!&quot; may not be brilliant, but it is fun and well designed.&quot;

==Sequels==
The huge popularity of the original &quot;Stars!&quot; game convinced the developers that there would be a market for a sequel. The developers of &quot;Stars!&quot; formed a company called Mare Crisium Studios and began development of &quot;Stars: Supernova Genesis&quot;. This was intended to be a much more advanced game, with significantly better graphics, and also to remove some of the irritations of the original, such as the high level of micro-management.

However, there was little interest from games publishers, who by that time had become focused exclusively on the video game console and high-end 3D games markets, and so the project was eventually abandoned. Rights to the in-game graphics remained with Empire, until they were acquired by Zoo Games.

<doc id="407506" wikidata="Q6132017" url="?curid=407506" title="USS Theodore Roosevelt (SSBN-600)">
<text>USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; (SSBN-600), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919). Initially unnamed and assigned hull classification symbol SSGN-600 as a guided missile submarine, her keel was laid down on 20 May 1958 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard using components initially assembled for the nuclear attack submarine . She was named &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and redesignated fleet ballistic missile submarine SSBN-600 on 6 November 1958, launched on 3 October 1959, sponsored by Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of Theodore Roosevelt and widow of Nicholas Longworth III, and commissioned on 13 February 1961 with Commander William E. Sims commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Oliver H. Perry Jr. commanding the Gold Crew.

==1960s==

On 18 February 1961, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; departed Mare Island, California, bound for the East Coast of the United States. On 7 March, she became the first FBM submarine to transit the Panama Canal. On 11 March 1961, she arrived at Cape Canaveral, Florida. After successfully firing her first Polaris A1 missile on 20 March 1961 and completing her shakedown training, she arrived in Groton, Connecticut, on 1 May for post-shakedown repairs at the Electric Boat Company shipyard. She completed those repairs on 24 June 1961 and departed Groton, bound for Charleston, South Carolina. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; stopped at Norfolk, Virginia, along the way and arrived at Charleston on 7 July 1961. Between 7 July and 19 July 1961, she loaded Polaris missiles at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Charleston, and made all other preparations for her first deployment. On 19 July 1961, she stood out of Charleston on her first deterrent patrol. She concluded that patrol on 23 September 1961 at the FBM submarine base at Holy Loch, Scotland.

Over the next three and one-half years, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; made 15 more deterrent patrols from the Holy Loch. Late in the spring of 1965, she departed Holy Loch on her 17th and final patrol of the deployment to Holy Loch. She concluded that patrol and the deployment when she arrived in Charleston on 15 June 1965. She unloaded her 16 Polaris missiles and then departed Charleston for New London, Connecticut, where she arrived on 26 June 1965.

At New London, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; entered the shipyard of the Electric Boat Division for an extensive overhaul. Between July 1965 and January 1967, her nuclear reactor was refueled and her Polaris weapon system was modified to accept the more advanced Polaris A3 missile. She completed overhaul on 14 January 1967 and began sea trials and refresher training, all of which culminated in the successful firing of a Polaris A3 missile at the Cape Canaveral missile range late in April 1967. At the end of the training period, she returned to Charleston to load missiles and to prepare for another series of deterrent patrols out of Holy Loch. She embarked upon her 18th patrol on 1 June 1967 and completed that cruise at the Holy Loch base.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;&#x27;s second tour of duty operating from the Scotland base proved to be very brief in comparison to her first. Between mid-June 1967 and February 1968, she completed her 18th through 21st patrols. On 20 March 1968 while returning to Holy Loch from her 21st patrol, she ran aground off the western coast of Scotland. After drydocking for temporary correction of the damage, she departed Holy Loch on 5 April 1968 to return to the United States for permanent repairs. Between 18 April and 20 April 1968 she unloaded her missiles at Charleston and headed north to New London. On 23 April 1968, she arrived in the shipyard of the Electric Boat Division and commenced an extended repair period. Labor disputes caused delays, and &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; did not complete her repairs until mid-October 1968. She spent the latter part of that month in sea trials and then departed New London on 2 November 1968 on her post-repair shakedown cruise. She visited Norfolk, Virginia, Puerto Rico, and St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands before concluding the cruise at Charleston on 27 November 1968. She conducted training operations out of Charleston before deploying to Holy Loch again early in 1969.

==1970s==
That tour of duty lasted until May 1971. During the interim, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; conducted nine more deterrent patrols, returning to Holy Loch for refit after each. On 12 May 1971, she stood out of Holy Loch on the 31st patrol of her career. On 20 July 1971, she arrived in New London completing both the patrol and the Holy Loch deployment. She remained in New London for three weeks, during which time members of her Blue crew and her Gold crew were brought together into a single overhaul crew while other members of both crews moved on to other assignments. On 10 August 1971, she headed south to Charleston where she arrived on 13 August 1971. Over the next month, she underwent refit and then departed Charleston on 11 September 1971 for special operations. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; returned to Charleston on 30 September 1971 and remained there a week and a day before returning to sea for another three weeks of special operations. She reentered Charleston on 1 November 1971 and began preoverhaul restricted repairs. Three weeks later, she officially began her refueling overhaul, which lasted for more than two years.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; completed her overhaul in January 1974. During the following two months, she conducted sea trials out of Charleston. In April and May shakedown training and nuclear weapons certification preparations occupied her time. In June, she conducted a one-week United States Naval Academy midshipman familiarization cruise out of New London, then underwent nuclear propulsion safety training before deperming at Norfolk. In mid-June, she received word of her reassignment to the United States Pacific Fleet with her new home port to be Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Between July and September 1974, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; conducted another midshipman training cruise; then settled into pre-deployment training and preparations. She departed Charleston on 20 September 1974, transited the Panama Canal on 5 October, and, after a nine-day stop for missile load-out at Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific in Bangor, Washington, continued on to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 4 November 1974. On 10 November, she departed Pearl Harbor, bound for the Mariana Islands. She entered port at Guam on 24 November, underwent refit at her new advanced base there, and began her first deterrent patrol in the Pacific Ocean on 31 December 1974.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; conducted patrols out of Apra Harbor, Guam, with support from the until beginning her last patrol (Patrol 46) on 9 October 1978, which ended in Pearl Harbor. Upon arrival in Pearl Harbor, a new crew was formed from members of the former Blue and Gold crews. From November 1978 until October 1979, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; served as a &quot;target of opportunity&quot; for various ASW forces including ships, aircraft and submarines. During this period she made several port calls to Lahaina, Maui, Kona, Hawaii, and Nawiliwili, Kauai. On 16 October 1979, the ship got underway from Pearl Harbor for San Diego, California, arriving on 25 October. She transited from San Diego to Alameda from 29 to 31 October. On 7 November, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; transited from Alameda to Esquimalt, British Columbia, arriving on 10 November. On 14 November, the ship left Esquimalt and arrived at Carr Inlet, Washington for acoustic testing while suspended on cables. On 19 November, she transited to Bangor, Washington, and submitted the first official work request (2-Kilo) to the newly established Trident Refit Facility. On 1 December 1979, she became the first Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarine to offload her A-3 Missiles at the newly built Explosives Handling Wharf. She was the &quot;first to do it last&quot;. &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was then officially taken out of service. The crew was reduced to 12 officers and 111 enlisted men, who were designated as the Deactivation Crew.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; commenced the Deactivation Availability process on 3 January 1980 at Submarine Base Bangor. In mid-year she was moved to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) for drydocking alongside &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, where the reactor fuel was removed and the missile compartment dismantled to comply with SALT requirements. The forward and aft ends of the hull were then re-joined at the aft bulkhead of the Operations compartment, and the forward bulkhead of the reactor compartment. The ship undocked and moved pier-side where a formal decommissioning ceremony occurred on 28 February 1981. The deactivation crew then detached and transferred to other Navy assignments. PSNS continued deactivation work pier-side, completing Deactivation Availability on 1 December 1982. The hull was placed in afloat storage at PSNS, and the ship stricken from the Naval Registry of Ships on that date. The hull remained in afloat storage in two configurations for almost 13 years, pending government decisions for the methods to dispose of de-fueled nuclear reactor compartments and the remaining hulls.

In 1988, the hull of &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was drydocked at PSNS for removal and disposal of the reactor compartment. An environmental impact study was approved in 1984 for the disposal of de-fueled submarine reactor compartments via permanent storage at the federal government reservation at Hanford, Washington. The reactor compartment was separated from the hull, placed on a barge in the drydock, and prepared for waterborne shipment to Hanford. The hull was re-joined at the aft bulkhead of the operations compartment, and the forward bulkhead of Auxiliary Machinery Space-2. Both hull and barge were undocked, with the hull returning to afloat storage and the reactor compartment transported to Hanford. The Hanford Burial Trench 94 numbering system indicates that the SSBN-600 RC was the seventh placed in that facility on 1 November 1989.

The remaining hull of &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was drydocked for the final time at PSNS in 1993, to enter the Nuclear Power Ship and Submarine Recycling Program. Final dismantling and recycling were accomplished based on a 1990 environmental impact study approving this method. On 24 March 1995, the disposal work was completed.

<doc id="407516" wikidata="Q3086229" url="?curid=407516" title="François de La Rochefoucauld, Marquis de Montandre">
<text>Field Marshal François de La Rochefoucauld, Marquis de Montandre, also known as Francis de La Rochefoucauld, (September 1672 – 11 August 1739) was a British soldier, who arrived in England as a Huguenot refugee. After serving as a junior officer during the Williamite War in Ireland, he was given command of Francis du Cambon&#x27;s Regiment of Foot and led his regiment in the Low Countries during the Nine Years&#x27; War . He also fought at the Siege of Badajoz and at the Battle of Alcantara during the War of the Spanish Succession. He went on to be Master General of the Ordnance in Ireland.

==Military career==

Born the son of Charles-Louis de La Rochefoucauld, 2nd marquis of Montandre of the Doudeauville branch of the family and Madeline-Anne de La Rochefoucauld (née Pithou), de La Rochefoucauld was brought up in France as a Roman Catholic but converted to Protestantism. After arriving in England as a Huguenot refugee in the aftermath of the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685, La Rochefoucauld joined William III&#x27;s Army and served under the Earl of Galway during the Williamite War in Ireland. He was commissioned as a brevet lieutenant colonel and given command of Francis du Cambon&#x27;s Regiment of Foot on 15 February 1692. He went with his regiment to the Low Countries in September 1692 during the Nine Years&#x27; War and in 1702 succeeded his brother Isaac, who died without issue, as 4th marquis de Montandre.

La Rochefoucauld joined the staff of the Earl of Galway as a brigadier-general in 1704 and fought at the Siege of Badajoz in October 1705 and the Battle of Alcantara in April 1706 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Promoted to major-general in the English Army on 1 June 1706, he took part in the advance to Madrid in June 1706 and became colonel of Dungannon&#x27;s Regiment in November 1706. He was given command of a brigade which landed in Portugal in June 1707 and led the brigade at the Battle of Caya in May 1709. On 29 September 1709 de La Rochefoucauld returned to London to report to Queen Anne on the course of operations in Portugal. Promoted to lieutenant general on 9 May 1710, he became colonel of a new regiment on the Irish establishment in 1715 but this regiment was disbanded in 1718.

La Rochefoucauld was appointed a Privy Counsellor of Ireland and became Master General of the Ordnance in Ireland in January 1727. Promoted to full general on 18 December 1735, he became Governor of Guernsey in September 1737. He was promoted to field marshal on 2 July 1739. He died at his home in Grosvenor Square in London on 11 August 1739 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. A new stone, quarried in Montendre and brought to London at the expense of the present Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville, was placed over his grave on 15 January 2013.

==Family==
In April 1710 de La Rochefoucauld married Mary Anne von Spanheim, daughter of Ezekiel, Freiherr von Spanheim (the Prussian ambassador to London); they had no children.

<doc id="407525" wikidata="Q61222" url="?curid=407525" title="Dietrich von Choltitz">
<text>Dietrich Hugo Hermann von Choltitz (; 9 November 1894 – 5 November 1966) was a German general. Sometimes referred to as the Saviour of Paris, he served in the Wehrmacht (armed forces) of Nazi Germany during World War II, as well as serving in the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic, and the Royal Saxon Army during World War I.

Born into an aristocratic Prussian family with a long history of military service, Choltitz joined the army at a young age and saw service on the Western Front during the First World War (1914–1918). He rose to the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; by the end of the war and was active in the interwar period helping Germany rebuild its armed forces. In September 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, he was serving in Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group South. In May 1940, Choltitz participated in the Battle of Rotterdam, making an air landing and seizing some of the city&#x27;s key bridges.

Choltitz is chiefly remembered for his role as the last commander of Nazi-occupied Paris in 1944, when he allegedly disobeyed Adolf Hitler&#x27;s orders to destroy the city, and instead surrendered it to Free French forces when they entered the city on 25 August. Choltitz later asserted that his defiance of Hitler&#x27;s direct order stemmed from its obvious military futility, his affection for the French capital&#x27;s history and culture, and his belief that Hitler had by then become insane. Other sources suggest that he had little control of the city thanks to the operations of the French Resistance, and could not have carried out such orders anyway.

== Early life and career ==

Dietrich Hugo Hermann von Choltitz was born on 9 November 1894, in his family&#x27;s castle in Gräflich Wiese (now Łąka Prudnicka, Poland) in the province of Silesia, from Neustadt (now Prudnik), in the Kingdom of Prussia, then part of the German Empire. He was a son of Hans von Choltitz (1865–1935), who was a major of the Prussian Army, and his German wife Gertrud von Rosenberg. He had two brothers named Hans and Job. He came from a Moravian-Silesian noble family of Sedlnitzky von Choltitz (Odrowąż coat of arms). His uncle Hermann von Choltitz was a governor of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. from 1907 to 1920. His family owned a forest between Prudnik and Niemysłowice.

In 1907 Dietrich von Choltitz enrolled in the Dresden Cadet School.

== World War I ==
He joined the 8. Infanterie-Regiment Prinz Johann Georg Nr. 107 of the Royal Saxon Army as a &quot;Fähnrich&quot; (officer candidate) just months before the First World War broke out. His unit served on the Western Front, where he fought in the First Battle of the Marne, the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, and the Battle of St. Quentin (1914). He was promoted to &quot;Leutnant&quot; and became adjutant of the regiment&#x27;s third Battalion within a year of joining.

== Between the wars ==
After World War I he returned to Prudnik, where on 20 August 1929 he married Huberta (1902–2001), the daughter of General of the Cavalry Otto von Garnier. The couple had two daughters, Maria Angelika (1930–2016) and Anna Barbara (born 1936), and a son, Timo (born 1944). He was transferred to the riding school in Soltau, as a rider he successfully participated in domestic and international riding competitions.

He remained in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; during the Weimar Republic, becoming a cavalry captain in 1929. Promoted to major in 1937, he was made commander of third battalion, &quot;Infanterie-Regiment 16 &quot;Oldenburg&quot;&quot;, a part of 22. Luftlande-Division. In 1938 he was promoted again, this time to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (lieutenant-colonel) .

He participated in the occupation of Sudetenland in 1938.

== World War II ==

=== Invasion of Poland ===

On 18 August 1939, in preparation for &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; (Case White) – the German invasion of Poland – Choltitz was appointed the commander of the 16th Air Landing Regiment in Sagan (now Żagań, Poland).

After the Battle of Łódź, on 12 September 1939 his regiment was transported to the airport in Łódź by the transport aircraft Junkers Ju 52.

On 15 September, the regiment was temporarily assigned to the 10th Infantry Division. It participated in the Battle of the Bzura, during which Choltitz was wounded. On 19 September, he captured 3,000 Polish soldiers and a large amount of military equipment.

=== Battle of the Netherlands ===

In May 1940, Choltitz participated in the Battle of Rotterdam, making an air landing and seizing some of the city&#x27;s key bridges. As commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 16th Air Landing Regiment, he began to organize his troops after landing them at Waalhaven Air Force Base. He sent them to the bridges in Rotterdam. The Dutch had not stationed many soldiers in the southern part of the city. One unit was made up of butchers and bakers and about 90 infantrymen, the latter being reinforced by riflemen who had withdrawn from the airfield. The Dutch troops hid in houses that were on the route to the bridges. There they ambushed the approaching German troops. Both sides suffered casualties. The Germans managed to bring up a PaK anti-tank gun. The Dutch had to yield under the ever-increasing pressure. The German force then moved on to the bridges, quickly followed by the bulk of 9th Company of the 16th Air Landing Regiment.

Meanwhile, the staff of 3rd Battalion of the 16th Air Landing Regiment had run into the Dutch in the square. &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; von Choltitz′s adjutant took charge of an assault on the Dutch position but was mortally wounded in the process. When the Germans looked for another route to the bridges to bypass the Dutch stronghold, they managed to find a wedge that advancing troops had created along the quays. It was at about 09:00 when the bulk of the 3rd Battalion made contact with the defenders of the bridges.

Although the Dutch did not regain control of the city, the Germans were suffering from continuous assaults on their positions. Casualties mounted up on both sides and the German command grew increasingly worried over the status of their 500 men in the heart of Rotterdam. &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; von Choltitz was allowed by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Kurt Student to withdraw his men from the northern pocket should he consider the operational situation required it.

When Captain Backer was being escorted back by &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; von Choltitz to the Maas bridges, German bombers appeared from the south. General Schmidt, who was joined by the two Generals, Hubicki and Student, saw the planes and cried out &quot;My God, this is going to be a catastrophe!&quot; Panic struck German soldiers on the Noordereiland, most of whom were totally unaware of the events being played out between the commanders on both sides. They feared being attacked by their own bombers. Choltitz ordered red flares to be launched, and when the first three bombers overhead dropped their bombs the red flares were obscured by smoke. The next 24 bombers of the southern formation closed their bomb hatches and turned westwards.

After the bombardment of Rotterdam, during a meeting with the Dutch discussing the terms of surrender of all Dutch forces in Rotterdam, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Kurt Student was injured by a gunshot to the head. Student was very popular with his troops, and when the German forces moved to execute surrendering Dutch officers in reprisal Choltitz intervened and was able to prevent the massacre. His actions during the assault on Rotterdam earned him the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. In September of the same year, he was given command of the regiment, and the following spring was promoted to Oberst (colonel).

=== Soviet Union 1941–1943 ===

At the start of Operation Barbarossa, Choltitz&#x27;s regiment was based in Romania, advancing as part of Army Group South into Ukraine. His route led through Bessarabia, he crossed the Dnieper river on 30 August 1941, and at the end of October he fought his way to the Crimea.

As part of Erich von Manstein&#x27;s 11th Army, the regiment fought in the siege of Sevastopol. The siege was bloody for Choltitz&#x27;s regiment, which was reduced in numbers from 4,800 men to just 349.

During the harsh winter at the turn of 1941 and 1942, Choltitz struggled with heart problems and also began to show symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; soon after, he was made acting commander of 260th Infantry division in 1942. He was then promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; the following year and given command of 11th Panzer Division, which he led during the Battle of Kursk.

=== Western front 1944 ===
In March 1944, Choltitz was transferred to the Italian theatre of operations, where he was made deputy commander of LXXVI Panzer Corps and participated in the Battle of Anzio and Monte Cassino. Transferred to the Western Front in June 1944, he took command of LXXXIV Army Corps, which he commanded against the Allied breakout from Normandy.

== Military Governor of Paris ==


On 1 August 1944, Choltitz was promoted to &quot;General der Infanterie&quot;, and on 7 August was appointed the military governor of Paris, making him &quot;commander of a besieged stronghold&quot;. Arriving on 8 August, he set up headquarters in the Hotel Meurice on the Rue De Rivoli, and found few resources at his disposal, and only 20,000 troops, mostly unmotivated conscripts.

On 15 August 1944, the Paris police went on strike, followed on 19 August by a general insurrection led by the French Communist Party. The German garrison under Choltitz fought back but was far too small to quell the uprising, and they lost control of many public buildings, many roads were blocked, and German vehicles and communications were damaged. With the help of the Swedish consul-general in Paris, Raoul Nordling, a ceasefire was brokered with the insurgents on 20 August, but many Resistance groups did not accept it, and a series of skirmishes continued on the next day.

On 23 August, Hitler gave the order to destroy the city by cable: &quot;&quot;Paris must not pass into the enemy&#x27;s hands, except as a field of ruins&quot;.&quot; (&quot;Paris darf nicht oder nur als Trümmerfeld in die Hand des Feindes fallen&quot;), after which explosives were laid at various bridges and monuments (which later had to be de-mined).

With the arrival of Allied troops on the edge of the city at dawn the next day on the 24th, Choltitz made the decision not to destroy the city, and on 25 August, surrendered the German garrison, not to the Supreme Allied Command, but rather to representatives of the provisional government, the Free French. Because Hitler&#x27;s directive was not carried out, Choltitz is often seen as the &quot;Saviour of Paris&quot;.

Hitler did not completely give up on the destruction, with the Luftwaffe conducting an incendiary bombing raid on 26 August, and V2 rockets fired from Belgium, causing extensive damage.

The events leading up to the surrender were the subject of a 1951 memoir written by General von Choltitz (published in French in the 1960s as &quot;From Sevastopol to Paris: A soldier among the soldiers&quot;) where he took credit for disobeying Hitler&#x27;s orders and saving Paris because of its obvious military futility, his affection for the French capital&#x27;s history and culture, and his belief that Hitler had by then become insane, and his version of events were the basis for the 1965 book and 1966 film, &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (repeated as factual in many sources, and a 2019 publication). His motivation not to destroy the city may have been in part because it was a futile and destructive gesture, but also in order to ensure his better treatment after capitulation.

The memoirs also state that he was persuaded to spare the city in part by an all-night meeting with Nordling on the night of 24 August. This event was depicted in the 2014 film &quot;Diplomacy&quot; in which Nordling persuades Choltitz to spare the city in return for a pledge to protect his family, which was reported as factual following the publication of his memoirs in some newspaper stories, but lacks any corroboration. He did hold several meetings with Nordling, along with the president of the municipal council, Pierre Taittinger, hoping to limit the bloodshed and damage to the city, and which led to the release of some political prisoners.

== Captivity and later life ==

Choltitz was held for the remainder of the war at Trent Park, in north London, with other senior German officers. Choltitz later was transferred to Camp Clinton in Mississippi. No specific charges were ever filed against him, and he was released from captivity in 1947. In 1956 he visited his wartime headquarters at the Hôtel Meurice in Paris. Reportedly the long-time head barman of the hotel recognized the short, rotund man with &quot;impossibly correct posture&quot; wandering around the bar as if in a daze. After the manager of the hotel met him in the bar, he asked to see his old room. After seeing his old quarters for no more than fifteen minutes, Choltitz declined the manager&#x27;s offer of champagne and left the hotel to meet with Pierre Taittinger.

Choltitz died on 5 November 1966 from a longstanding war illness (pulmonary emphysema) in the city hospital of Baden-Baden. Four days later, he was buried at the city cemetery of Baden-Baden in the presence of high-ranking French officers, including colonels Wagner (Military Commander of Baden-Baden), Ravinel, and Omézon. Baden-Baden was the French headquarters in Germany after the end of the Second World War.

Choltitz was the last German owner of the castle in Łąka Prudnicka, his birthplace (until 1945 it had been part of Germany as &quot;Gräflich Wiese&quot;). In 2016 his son, Timo, tried to get it back during his visit in Prudnik, but without success.

=== Complicity in war crimes ===
During his internment in Trent Park many of the officers&#x27; private conversations were secretly recorded by the British in the hope that they might reveal strategic information. In one such conversation, on 29 August 1944, Choltitz was quoted as saying &quot;The worst job I ever carried out - which however I carried out with great consistency - was the liquidation of the Jews. I carried out this thoroughly and entirely.&quot; Randall Hansen says that there is a lack of corroboration but that since many German generals committed atrocities it is possible, even probable, that Choltitz ordered the massacre of Jews. He observed that &quot;it is easier to believe that Choltitz was the sort of unreflective anti-Semite that one would expect, given his age, class and profession.&quot; Selected transcripts were dramatized in the History Channel 5-part series &quot;The Wehrmacht&quot; (2008). In the episode &quot;The Crimes&quot;, General von Choltitz is quoted as saying in October 1944,
At the very least, Choltitz was fully aware that the Nazis were committing mass murder against the Jews. For example, Choltitz estimated that the Nazis shot 36,000 Jews from Sevastopol.

<text>Field Marshal John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair, (20 July 16739 May 1747) was a Scottish soldier and diplomat. He served in the Nine Years&#x27; War and the War of the Spanish Succession and, after a period as British Ambassador in Paris, became a military commander at the Battle of Dettingen during the War of the Austrian Succession.

==Early military career==
Born the son of John Dalrymple, 2nd Viscount Stair (and later 1st Earl of Stair) and Elizabeth Dalrymple (née Dundas), Dalrymple accidentally killed his brother in a shooting accident in April 1682 and thereafter spent most of his early life in the Netherlands where he studied at Leiden University. He joined up as a volunteer for the Nine Years&#x27; War with the Earl of Angus&#x27;s Regiment and fought at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692. At Steenkerque he rallied his regiment several times when the ranks had been broken by cannon fire. In 1695 he became Master of Stair when his father succeeded to the Viscountcy of Stair.

He was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd Foot Guards on 12 May 1702 and fought with John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough during the War of the Spanish Succession at the Battle of Peer in August 1702 and the Battle of Venlo in September 1702. At Venlo he also saved the life of the Prince of Hesse-Kassel.

He became Viscount Dalrymple in 1703 when his father was created 1st Earl of Stair. In January 1706 he was appointed colonel of the Earl of Angus&#x27;s Regiment. He commanded a brigade at the Battle of Ramillies in May 1706 and, having been promoted to brigadier general on 1 June 1706, became colonel of the Grey Dragoons on 24 August 1706. He became 2nd Earl of Stair in January 1707 when his father died and later that year he was elected as one of sixteen Scottish representative peers in the newly formed Parliament of Great Britain.

He commanded a brigade at the Battle of Oudenarde in July 1708, the Siege of Lille in Autumn 1708 and then, having been promoted to major general on 1 January 1709, at the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709. In Winter 1709 the Duke of Marlborough sent him on a diplomatic mission to Augustus II of Poland. He returned in time to take part in the Siege of Douai in April 1710. Promoted to lieutenant general on 1 June 1710, he fought at the Siege of Bouchain in August 1711. He was also appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle that year.

He was sent to Flanders to join the military campaign there in April 1712 and became colonel of the Black Dragoons on 9 April 1714.

== Diplomatic service ==
When King George I ascended to the throne in August 1714, Dalrymple was sent as an envoy to the Court of France at Versailles. He was temporarily recalled on 20 November 1714 to take up the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Scotland.

According to the Duc de Saint-Simon, Stair quickly established friendly relations with Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Regent to the young King Louis XV, paving the way for the Triple Alliance. During his time in Paris, Stair&#x27;s spies effectively thwarted various &quot;intrigues&quot; by the Jacobites. However, his intemperate hostility to the Scottish financier John Law, whom the Regent had appointed controller of Louis XV&#x27;s finances, cost him the confidence of British government ministers. 

From 1715 to 1720 Stair was based as ambassador at Versailles, where he was greatly inspired by the landscaping.

Stair retired from his position as ambassador in France in June 1720. On his return to Scotland, Stair planted extensively on the Versailles model at his estates at both Newliston House and Castle Kennedy.

In 1729, he became Vice Admiral of Scotland, but lost the position on 5 May 1733, mainly because of his opposition to the Excise Bill of 1733 promoted by Prime Minister Robert Walpole. He was promoted to full general, on the basis of seniority, on 27 October 1735 and also found time to lay out the gardens at Castle Kennedy in the 1730s.

==War of the Austrian Succession==

On 20 March 1742, after Walpole had fallen from office, Dalrymple was promoted to field marshal. On 17 April 1742 he was made Governor of Minorca and on 20 April 1742 took command of the &quot;Pragmatic Army&quot; sent to act with Hanoverian and Austrian forces in support of the Pragmatic Sanction to defend the succession of Maria Theresa to the Austrian monarchy. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in South Britain on 28 February 1743 and colonel of the Black Dragoons again on 30 April 1743 and led the allies to victory at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743. He retired from command of the army in Flanders at his own request on account of his advancing years in September 1743 and retired as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces to make way for General George Wade in 1745.

On 4 June 1745 he became colonel of the Grey Dragoons and on 14 June 1746 he became General of the Marine Forces. His favourite residence was Newliston near Kirkliston in Linlithgowshire, where he laid out gardens in the French style.

He died on 9 May 1747 at Queensberry House in Edinburgh and was buried in the family vault at Kirkliston.

== Family ==
In March 1708 he married Lady Eleanor Primrose Campbell, daughter of James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun. She already had four children and they had no children.

Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s story &quot;My Aunt Margaret&#x27;s Mirror&quot; is believed to have been based on efforts made by the Earl of Stair to get Lady Eleanor Primrose Campbell to marry him. Stair wanted his earldom to pass to his nephew John Dalrymple; but on 4 May 1748 the House of Lords ruled that the right to nominate an heir had lapsed, and the earldom passed to the legal heir James Dalrymple, 3rd Earl of Stair.

<doc id="407529" wikidata="Q1147274" url="?curid=407529" title="Apostolic see">
<text>An apostolic see is an episcopal see whose foundation is attributed to one or more of the apostles of Jesus or to one of their close associates. In Catholicism, the phrase &quot;The Apostolic See&quot; when capitalized refers specifically to the See of Rome.

Tertullian (c. 155 − c. 240) gives examples of apostolic sees: he describes as churches &quot;in which the very thrones of the apostles are still pre-eminent in their places, in which their own authentic writings are read, uttering the voice and representing the face of each of them severally&quot; the following churches: Corinth, Philippi, Ephesus, and Rome.

Tertullian says that from these &quot;all the other churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the faith, and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving them, that they may become churches. Indeed, it is on this account only that they will be able to deem themselves apostolic, as being the offspring of apostolic churches&quot;.

== Cited by early apologists for doctrinal authority ==

Tertullian himself and the slightly earlier Irenaeus (c. 130 – c. 200) speak of the succession of bishops of sees founded directly by the apostles as sources for sure Christian doctrine.

Irenaeus argues that, to know what is true Christian doctrine, it is enough to learn the teaching of some of the oldest churches or at least one, in particular that of Rome: &quot;If the apostles had known hidden mysteries, which they were in the habit of imparting to &#x27;the perfect&#x27; apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered them especially to those to whom they were also committing the Churches themselves. [...] Suppose there arise a dispute relative to some important question among us, should we not have recourse to the most ancient Churches with which the apostles held constant intercourse, and learn from them what is certain and clear in regard to the present question?&quot;

Tertullian&#x27;s arguing is similar: From the apostles the churches they founded received the doctrine that the apostles received directly from Christ, and from those churches the more recent churches received the same doctrine. Every heresy is more recent and, being different, is erroneous.

== Distinct from jurisdictional authority ==

Jurisdictional authority of particular episcopal sees over others is not necessarily associated with the apostolic origin of the see. Thus, the fourth canon of the First Council of Nicaea of 325 attributed to the bishop of the capital (metropolis) of each Roman province (the &quot;metropolitan bishop&quot;) a position of authority among the bishops of the province, without reference to the founding figure of that bishop&#x27;s see.

Its sixth canon the same council recognized the wider authority, extending beyond a single imperial province, traditionally held by Rome and Alexandria, and the prerogatives of the churches in Antioch and the other provinces.

Of Aelia, the Roman city built on the site of the destroyed city of Jerusalem, the council&#x27;s seventh canon reads: &quot;Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of Aelia should be honoured, let him, saving its due dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place of honour.&quot; The metropolis in question is generally taken to be Caesarea Maritima, though in the late 19th century Philip Schaff also mentioned other views.

The see of Constantinople was elevated to a position of jurisdictional prominence not on the grounds of apostolic origin but because of its political importance as the capital of the Roman Empire. The First Council of Constantinople (381), held in what by then had been the political capital for half a century, decreed in a canon of disputed validity: &quot;The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome.&quot; It was later ranked second among the sees in the theory of Pentarchy: &quot;[F]ormulated in the legislation of the emperor Justinian I (527–565), especially in his Novella 131, the theory received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the Council in Trullo (692), which ranked the five sees as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.&quot;

For another pentarchic see, that of Alexandria, the reputed founder and close associate of the apostle Peter, Saint Mark, is not called an apostle in the New Testament.

== Sees or Churches viewed as founded by apostles or their close associates ==
* Alexandria (Coptic, Coptic Catholic, Greek Orthodox): Saint Mark the Evangelist
* Antioch (Greek Orthodox, Maronite, Melkite, Syriac Catholic, Syriac Orthodox): Saint Peter
* Aquileia: Mark the Evangelist as one of the Seventy Apostles
* Armenia (Armenian Apostolic Church, Armenian Catholic Church): Thaddaeus (Jude the Apostle) and Bartholomew the Apostle
* Athens: Saint Paul
* Bulgarian Orthodox Church: Saint Andrew
* Constantinople: Saint Andrew
* Corinth: Saint Paul
* Cyprus, based at New Justiniana (Erdek): Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas
* Ephesus: John the Apostle
* Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church maintains that Christianity was originally introduced to Ethiopia through Saint Philip the Evangelist
* Georgian Orthodox Church: Saint Andrew and Simon the Canaanite
* Goa and Maharashtra: Bartholomew the Apostle – Roman Martyrology of the Catholic Church mentions a tradition that Bartholomew the Apostle preached in India. The studies of Fr A.C. Perumalil SJ and Moraes hold that the Bombay region on the Konkan coast, a region which may have been known as the ancient city Kalyan, was the field of Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s missionary activities. Another unofficial book entitled ‘Martyrdom of Bartholomew’ says that, though he is generally said to have been martyred in Armenia, he was martyred in India. In these texts, two kings named Polyamus and Astriyagis have been described. Circa AD 55 the king named Pulaimi ruled near Kalyan, who in Latin language is called as Polyamus and King Aristakarman, who succeeded Pulaimi, might have a Latin name of Astriyais and it is in Goan tradition that the Apostle preached in Goa and Maharashtra.
* Jerusalem (Greek Orthodox, Latin): Saint Peter and Saint James
* Malta: Saint Paul
* Milan: Saint Barnabas
* Patras: Saint Andrew
* Philippi: Saint Paul
* Romania: Saint Andrew, who is said to have preached in Scythia (identified with Scythia Minor, Dobruja, and the Metropolitan of Tomis).
* Rome: Saint Peter and Saint Paul
* The Russian Orthodox Church and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine claim a connection with Saint Andrew, who is said to have visited the area where the city of Kyiv later arose.
* Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala claim a connection with Thomas the Apostle; they are now divided between (in alphabetic order): Chaldean Syrian Church, Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, Malabar Independent Syrian Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Mar Thoma Syrian Church, St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church)
* Santiago de Compostela: James the Great
* Seleucia-Ctesiphon or Babylon (claimed by, in alphabetical order, Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church): Thomas the Apostle, Bartholomew the Apostle, and Thaddeus of Edessa
* Syracuse: Saint Peter
* Thessalonica: Saint Paul

== Apostles or their close associates claimed as founders of sees ==
* Andrew: Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Constantinople, Corinth, Georgian Orthodox Church, Patras, Romanian Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church, Orthodox Church of Ukraine
* Barnabas: Cyprus, Milan
* Bartholomew: Armenian Apostolic Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Babylon
* James, brother of Jesus: Jerusalem (Greek Orthodox, Latin)
* James the Great: Santiago de Compostela
* John: Ephesus 
* Mark: Alexandria (Coptic, Coptic Catholic, Greek Orthodox), Aquileia
* Paul: Athens, Cyprus, Malta, Philippi, Rome, Thessalonica, Illyria (Albanian Orthodox Church)
* Peter: Antioch (Greek Orthodox, Maronite, Melkite, Syriac Catholic, Syriac Orthodox), Jerusalem (Greek Orthodox, Latin), Rome, Syracuse
* Philip the Evangelist: Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church
* Simon the Canaanite: Georgian Orthodox Church
* Thaddaeus/Jude the Apostle: Armenian Apostolic Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church (Babylon)
* Thaddeus of Edessa: Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church (Babylon)
* Thomas: Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church (Babylon); Saint Thomas Christians. The latter are now divided between (in alphabetical order): Chaldean Syrian Church, Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, Malabar Independent Syrian Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Mar Thoma Syrian Church, St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church)

== Rome as the Apostolic See ==

By a long-standing usage, evidenced already in 431, when the Council of Ephesus, the third ecumenical council, employed the phrase &quot;our most holy and blessed pope Cœlestine, bishop of the Apostolic See&quot;, the expression, &quot;&quot;the&quot; Apostolic See&quot;, is used in the singular and capitalized to mean specifically the Holy See and represent the Pope as head of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church and successor of Saint Peter.

In Catholic canon law, the term is applied also to the various departments of the Roman Curia. The Code of Canon Law states: &quot;In this Code the terms Apostolic See or Holy See mean not only the Roman Pontiff, but also, unless the contrary is clear from the nature of things or from the context, the Secretariat of State, the Council for the public affairs of the Church, and the other Institutes of the Roman Curia.&quot; The bodies in question are seen as speaking on behalf of the See of Rome.

<text>Olympe de Gouges (; born Marie Gouze; 7 May 17483 November 1793) was a French playwright and political activist. She is best known for her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen and other writings on women&#x27;s rights and abolitionism.

Born in southwestern France, de Gouges began her prolific career as a playwright in Paris in the 1780s. A passionate advocate of human rights, she was one of France&#x27;s earliest public opponents of slavery. Her plays and pamphlets spanned a wide variety of issues including divorce and marriage, children&#x27;s rights, unemployment and social security. In addition to her being a playwright and political activist, she was also a small time actress prior to the Revolution. De Gouges welcomed the outbreak of the French Revolution but soon became disenchanted when equal rights were not extended to women. In 1791, in response to the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, de Gouges published her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, in which she challenged the practice of male authority and advocated for equal rights for women.

De Gouges was associated with the moderate Girondins and opposed the execution of Louis XVI. Her increasingly vehement writings, which attacked Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s radical Montagnards and the Revolutionary government during the Reign of Terror, led to her eventual arrest and execution by guillotine in 1793.

==Biography==
===Birth and parentage===

Marie Gouze was born on 7 May 1748 in Montauban, Quercy (in the present-day department of Tarn-et-Garonne), in southwestern France. Her mother, Anne Olympe Mouisset Gouze, was the daughter of a bourgeois family. The identity of her father is ambiguous. Her father may have been her mother&#x27;s husband, Pierre Gouze, or she may have been the illegitimate daughter of Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan. Marie Gouze encouraged rumours that Pompignan was her father, and their relationship is considered plausible but &quot;historically unverifiable.&quot; Other rumours in the eighteenth century also suggested that her father might be Louis XV, but this identification is not considered credible.

The Pompignan family had long-standing close ties to the Mouisset family of Marie Gouze&#x27;s mother, Anne. When Anne was born in 1727, the eldest Pompignan son, Jean-Jacques Lefranc de Pompignan (age five), was her godfather. Anne&#x27;s father tutored him as he grew. During their childhoods, Pompignan became close to Anne, but was separated from her in 1734 when he was sent to Paris. Anne married Pierre Gouze, a butcher, in 1737 and had three children before Marie, a son and two girls. Pompignan returned to Montauban in 1747, the year before Marie&#x27;s birth. Pierre was legally recognized as Marie&#x27;s father. Pierre did not attend Marie&#x27;s baptism on 8 May. Her godfather was a workman named Jean Portié, and her godmother a woman named Marie Grimal. Pierre died in 1750.

The primary support for the identification of Pompignan as Marie Gouze&#x27;s father is found in her semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;&quot;, published after Pompignan&#x27;s death. According to the contemporary politician and others, &quot;all of Montauban&quot; knew that Pompignan was Gouze&#x27;s father. However, some historians consider it likely that Gouze fabricated the story for her memoirs in order to raise her prestige and social standing when she moved to Paris.

===Early life===
Marie-Olympe de Gouges (formally Marie Gouze) was born into a wealthy family, and although her mother was privately tutored, she had no actual formal education herself. Reportedly illiterate, she was said to dictate to a secretary.

Gouze was married on 24 October 1765 to Louis Yves Aubry, a caterer, against her will. The heroine of her semi-autobiographical novel is fourteen at her wedding; the new Marie Aubry herself was seventeen. Her novel strongly decried the marriage: &quot;I was married to a man I did not love and who was neither rich nor well-born. I was sacrificed for no reason that could make up for the repugnance I felt for this man.&quot; Marie&#x27;s substantially larger fortune allowed her new husband Louis to leave his employer and start his own business. On 29 August 1766, she gave birth to their son, Pierre Aubry. That November, a destructive flood of the river Tarn caused Louis&#x27; death. She never married again, calling the institution of marriage &quot;the tomb of trust and love&quot;.

Known under the name Marie Aubry, after her husband&#x27;s death she changed her name to Olympe de Gouges, from her surname (Gouze) and adding her mother&#x27;s middle name, Olympe. Soon after, she began a relationship with the wealthy Jacques Biétrix de Rozières, a businessman from Lyon.

===Move to Paris===
In 1768, Biétrix funded de Gouges&#x27;s move to Paris, where he provided her with an income. She lived with her son and her sister. She socialized in fashionable society, at one point being called &quot;one of Paris&#x27; prettiest women,&quot; and formed friendships with Madame de Montesson and Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. De Gouges attended the artistic and philosophical &#x27; of Paris, where she met many writers, including La Harpe, Mercier, and Chamfort, as well as future politicians such as Brissot and Condorcet. She usually was invited to the &#x27; of Madame de Montesson and the Comtesse de Beauharnais, who also were playwrights.

De Gouges began her career as a writer in Paris, publishing a novel in 1784 and then beginning a prolific career as a playwright. As a woman from the province and of lowly birth she fashioned herself to fit in with the Paris establishment. De Gouges signed her public letters with &quot;citoyenne&quot;, the feminised version of citizen. In pre-revolutionary France there were no citizens, and authors were the subjects of the king, but in revolutionary France there were only &quot;citoyens&quot;. It was in October 1792 that the Convention decreed the use of &quot;citoyenne&quot; to replace &quot;Madame&quot; and &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;.

In 1788 she published &quot;Réflexions sur les hommes nègres&quot;, which demanded compassion for the plight of slaves in the French colonies. For de Gouges there was a direct link between the autocratic monarchy in France and the institution of slavery. She argued that &quot;Men everywhere are equal... Kings who are just do not want slaves; they know that they have submissive subjects.&quot; She came to the public&#x27;s attention with the play &quot;L&#x27;Esclavage des Noirs&quot;, which was staged at the famous Comédie-Française in 1785. Her stance against slavery in the French colonies made her the target of threats. De Gouges was also attacked by those who thought that a woman&#x27;s proper place was not in the theatre. The influential Abraham-Joseph Bénard remarked &quot;Mme de Gouges is one of those women to whom one feels like giving razor blades as a present, who through their pretensions lose the charming qualities of their sex... Every woman author is in a false position, regardless of her talent.&quot; De Gouges was defiant: she wrote &quot;I&#x27;m determined to be a success, and I&#x27;ll do it in spite of my enemies.&quot; The slave trade lobby mounted a press campaign against her play and she eventually took legal action, forcing Comédie-Française to stage &quot;L&#x27;Esclavage des Noirs&quot;. But the play closed after three performances; the lobby had paid hecklers to sabotage the performances.

===Revolutionary politics===
A passionate advocate of human rights, de Gouges greeted the outbreak of the Revolution with hope and joy, but soon became disenchanted when &#x27; (equal rights) was not extended to women. In 1791, influenced and inspired by John Locke&#x27;s treatises on natural rights, de Gouges became part of the Society of the Friends of Truth, also known as the &quot;Social Club,&quot; which was an association whose goals included establishing equal political and legal rights for women. Members sometimes gathered at the home of the well-known women&#x27;s rights advocate, Sophie de Condorcet. In 1791, in response to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, she wrote the &#x27; (&quot;&quot;). In that pamphlet she expressed, for the first time, her famous statement:

A woman has the right to mount the scaffold. She must possess equally the right to mount the speaker&#x27;s platform.

This was followed by her &quot; (&quot;, named after a famous work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau), proposing marriage based upon gender equality.

In 1790 and 1791, in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), free people of colour and African slaves revolted in response to the ideals expressed in the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot;. De Gouges did not approve of violent revolution, and published &quot;L&#x27;Esclavage des Noirs&quot; with a preface in 1792, arguing that the slaves and the free people who responded to the horrors of slavery with &quot;barbaric and atrocious torture&quot; in turn justified the behavior of the tyrants. In Paris, de Gouges was accused by the mayor of Paris of having incited the insurrection in Saint-Domingue with the play. When it was staged again in December 1792 a riot erupted in Paris.

De Gouges opposed the execution of Louis XVI (which took place on 21 January 1793), partly out of opposition to capital punishment and partly because she favored constitutional monarchy. This earned her the ire of many hard-line republicans, even into the next generation—such as the 19th-century historian Jules Michelet, a fierce apologist for the Revolution, who wrote, &quot;She allowed herself to act and write about more than one affair that her weak head did not understand.&quot; Michelet opposed any political participation by women and thus disliked de Gouges. In December 1792, when Louis XVI was about to be put on trial, she wrote to the National Assembly offering to defend him, causing outrage among many deputies. In her letter she argued that he had been duped—that he was guilty as a king, but innocent as a man, and that he should be exiled rather than executed.

Olympe de Gouges was associated with the Gironde faction, which ultimately led to her being executed. After the execution of Louis XVI she became wary of Robespierre&#x27;s Montagnard faction and in open letters criticized their violence and summary killings. She did not go to the guillotine for her feminism, as many might think. Instead her crime was spreading Federalism as a replacement for Montagnard revolutionary central rule. Revolutionary rule during the Terror was accompanied by emphasis on masculine public political authority that resulted, for example, in the expulsion of women from Jacobin clubs.

===Arrest and execution===

As the Revolution progressed, she became more and more vehement in her writings. On 2 June 1793, the Jacobins of the Montagnard faction imprisoned prominent Girondins; they were sent to the guillotine in October. Finally, her poster &quot; (&quot;&quot;) of 1793, led to her arrest. Olympe decreed in this publication that &quot;Now is the time to establish a decent government whose energy comes from the strength of its laws; now is the time to put a stop to assassinations and the suffering they cause, for merely holding opposing views. Let everyone examine their consciences; let them see the incalculable harm caused by such a long-lasting division...and then everyone can pronounce freely on the government of their choice. The majority must carry the day. It is time for death to rest and for anarchy to return to the underworld.&quot; She also called for an end to the bloodshed of the Revolution saying &quot;It is time to put a stop to this cruel war that has only swallowed up your treasure and harvested the most brilliant of your young. Blood, alas, has flowed far too freely!&quot; and warned that &quot;The divided French... are fighting for three opposing governments; like warring brothers they rush to their downfall and, if I do not halt them, they will soon imitate the Thebans, ending up by slitting each others throats to the last man standing&quot;. That piece demanded a plebiscite for a choice among three potential forms of government: the first, a unitary republic, the second, a federalist government, or the third, a constitutional monarchy. The problem was that the law of the revolution made it a capital offense for anyone to publish a book or pamphlet that encouraged reestablishing the monarchy.

Marie-Olympe de Gouges was arrested on 20 July 1793. Although she was arrested in July, she would not meet the end of her life until November of that year.
After her arrest, the commissioners searched her house for evidence. When they could not find any in her home, she voluntarily led them to the storehouse where she kept her papers. It was there that the commissioners found an unfinished play titled &quot; (&quot;). In the first act (only the first act and a half remain), Marie Antoinette is planning defense strategies to retain the crumbling monarchy and is confronted by revolutionary forces, including de Gouges herself. The first act ends with de Gouges reproving the queen for having seditious intentions and lecturing her about how she should lead her people. Both de Gouges and her prosecutor used this play as evidence in her trial. The prosecutor claimed that de Gouges&#x27;s depictions of the queen threatened to stir up sympathy and support for the Royalists, whereas de Gouges stated that the play showed that she had always been a supporter of the Revolution.

She spent three months in jail without an attorney as the presiding judge had denied de Gouges her legal right to a lawyer on the grounds that she was more than capable of representing herself. It is likely that the judge based this argument on de Gouges&#x27;s tendency to represent herself in her writings. Through her friends, she managed to publish two texts: &#x27; (&quot;), in which she related her interrogations; and her last work, &#x27; (&quot;), in which she condemned the Terror.

De Gouges had acquired for her son, Pierre Aubry, a position as a vice-general and head of battalion in exchange for a payment of 1,500 livres, and he was suspended from this office after her arrest. On 2 November 1793 she wrote to him: &quot;I die, my dear son, a victim of my idolatry for the fatherland and for the people. Under the specious mask of republicanism, her enemies have brought me remorselessly to the scaffold.&quot;

On 3 November 1793, the Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced her to death, and she was executed for seditious behavior and attempting to reinstate the monarchy. Olympe was executed only a month after Condorcet had been proscribed, and just three days after the Girondin leaders had been guillotined. Her body was disposed of in the Madeleine Cemetery. Olympe&#x27;s last moments were depicted by an anonymous Parisian who kept a chronicle of events:

Yesterday, at seven o&#x27;clock in the evening, a most extraordinary person called Olympe de Gouges who held the imposing title of woman of letters, was taken to the scaffold, while all of Paris, while admiring her beauty, knew that she didn&#x27;t even know her alphabet... She approached the scaffold with a calm and serene expression on her face, and forced the guillotine&#x27;s furies, which had driven her to this place of torture, to admit that such courage and beauty had never been seen before... That woman... had thrown herself in the Revolution, body and soul. But having quickly perceived how atrocious the system adopted by the Jacobins was, she chose to retrace her steps. She attempted to unmask the villains through the literary productions which she had printed and put up. They never forgave her, and she paid for her carelessness with her head.

===Posthumous political impact===

Her execution was used as a warning to other politically active women. At the 15 November 1793 meeting of the Commune, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette cautioned a group of women wearing Phrygian bonnets, reminding them of &quot;the impudent Olympe de Gouges, who was the first woman to start up women&#x27;s political clubs, who abandoned the cares of her home, to meddle in the affairs of the Republic, and whose head fell under avenging blade of the law&quot;. This posthumous characterisation of de Gouges by the political establishment was misleading, as de Gouges had no role in founding the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women. In her political writings de Gouges had not called for women to abandon their homes, but she was cast by the politicians as an enemy of the natural order, and thus enemy of the ruling Jacobin party. Paradoxically, the two women who had started the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, Claire Lacombe and Pauline Léon, were not executed. Lacombe, Léon and Theroigne de Mericourt had spoken at women&#x27;s and mixed clubs, and the Assemblée, while de Gouges had shown a reluctance to engage in public speaking, but prolifically published pamphlets. However, Chaumette was a staunch opponent of the Girondins, and had characterised de Gouges as unnatural and unrepublican prior to her execution.

The year 1793 has been described as a watershed for the construction of women&#x27;s place in revolutionary France, and the deconstruction of the Girondins&#x27; Marianne. That year a number of women with a public role in politics were executed, including Madame Roland and Marie-Antoinette. The new &quot;Républicaine&quot; was the republican mother that nurtured the new citizen. During this time the Convention banned all women&#x27;s political associations and executed many politically active women. 1793 marked the start of the Reign of Terror in post-revolutionary France, where thousands of people were executed. Across the Atlantic world observers of the French Revolution were shocked, but the ideals of liberté, égalité, fraternité had taken a life of their own.

De Gouges&#x27;s Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen had been widely reproduced and influenced the writings of women&#x27;s advocates in the Atlantic world. One year after its publication, in 1792, the keen observer of the French Revolution Mary Wollstonecraft published &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;. Writings on women and their lack of rights became widely available. The experience of French women during the revolution entered the collective consciousness.

American women began to refer to themselves as &quot;citess&quot; or &quot;citizeness&quot; and took to the streets to achieve equality and freedom. The same year de Gouges was executed the pamphlet &quot;On the Marriage of Two Celebrated Widows&quot; was published anonymously, proclaiming that &quot;two celebrated widows, ladies of America and France, after having repudiated their husbands on account of their ill treatment, conceived of the design of living together in the strictest union and friendship.&quot; Revolutionary novels were published that put women at the centre of violent struggle, such as the narratives written by Helen Maria Williams and Leonora Sansay. At the 1848 Women&#x27;s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls, the rhetorical style of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen was employed to paraphrase the United States Declaration of Independence into the Declaration of Sentiments, which demanded women&#x27;s right to vote.

After her execution her son Pierre Aubry signed a letter in which he denied his endorsement for her political legacy. He tried to change her name in the records, to Marie Aubry, but the name she had given herself has endured.

==Writing==
All of Olympe de Gouges&#x27;s plays and novels convey the overarching theme of her life&#x27;s work: indignation at social injustices. In addition to women&#x27;s rights, de Gouges engaged contested topics including the slave trade, divorce, marriage, debtors&#x27; prisons, children&#x27;s rights, and government work schemes for the unemployed. Much of her work foregrounded the troubling intersections of two or more issues. While many plays by women playwrights staged at the Comédie Française were published anonymously or under male pseudonyms, de Gouges broke with tradition; not only did she publish using her own name, but she also pushed the boundaries of what was deemed appropriate subject matter for women playwrights—and withstood the consequences. A record of her papers which were seized at the time of execution in 1793 lists about 40 plays.

In 1784 she published an epistolary novel inspired by &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; (1782) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. Her novel claimed to consist of authentic letters exchanged with her father the Marquis de Pompignan, with the names changed. &quot;Madame Valmont&quot; thus represented de Gouges herself, and &quot;Monsieur de Flaucourt&quot; was Pompignan. The full title of the novel, published shortly after Pompignan&#x27;s death, indicated its claim: &quot; (Madame de Valmont&#x27;s Memoirs on the Ingratitude and Cruelty of the Flaucourt Family Towards her Own, which Rendered such Services to the Sirs Flaucourt).&quot;

As a playwright, she charged into the contemporary political controversies and was often in the vanguard. Alongside Marquis de Condorcet, de Gouges is considered one of France&#x27;s earliest public opponents of slavery.

De Gouges&#x27;s first staged production was originally titled &quot;Zamore et Mirza&quot;; ou &quot;L&#x27;Heureux Naufrage&quot; [&quot;Zamore and Mirza;&quot; or &quot;The Happy Shipwreck&quot;] (1788). Drawing both praise from abolitionists and attacks from pro-slavery traders, it is the first French play to focus not only on the inhumanity of slavery but also the first to feature the first-person perspective of an enslaved individual.

In her 1788 &quot;Réflexions sur les Hommes Nègres&quot; she brought to attention the horrible plight of slaves in the French colonies and condemned the injustice of the institution declaring “I clearly realized that it was force and prejudice that had condemned them to that horrible slavery, in which Nature plays no role, and for which the unjust and powerful interests of Whites are alone responsible” likewise declaring that &quot;Men everywhere are equal... Kings who are just do not want slaves; they know that they have submissive subjects.&quot;

In the final act of &quot;L&#x27;Esclavage des Noirs&quot; de Gouges lets the French colonial master, not the slave, utter a prayer for freedom: &quot;Let our common rejoicings be a happy portent of liberty&quot;. She drew a parallel between colonial slavery and political oppression in France. One of the slave protagonists explains that the French must gain their own freedom, before they can deal with slavery. De Gouges also openly attacked the notion that human rights were a reality in revolutionary France. The slave protagonist comments on the situation in France &quot;The power of one Master alone is in the hands of a thousand Tyrants who trample the People under foot. The People will one day burst their chains and will claim all its rights under Natural law. It will teach the Tyrants just what a people united by long oppression and enlightened by sound philosophy can do&quot;. While it was common in France to equate political oppression to slavery, this was an analogy and not an abolitionist sentiment.

===Political pamphlets and letters===
Over the course of her career, de Gouges published 68 pamphlets. Her first political brochure was published in November 1788, a manifesto entitled &quot;Letter to the people, or project for a patriotic fund&quot;. In early 1789 she published &quot;Remarques Patriotiques&quot; setting out her proposals for social security, care for the elderly, institutions for homeless children, hostels for the unemployed, and the introduction of a jury system. In this work, she highlighted and promulgated the issues facing France on the brink of revolution writing “France is sunk in grief, the people are suffering and the Monarch cries out. Parliament is demanding the Estates-General and the Nation cannot come to an agreement. There is no consensus on electing these assemblies...The Third Estate, with reason, claims a voice equal to that of the Clergy and Nobility...for the problems that get worse every day” and declared to the king that “Your People are unhappy. Unhappy!”. She also called upon women to &quot;shake off the yoke of shameful slavery&quot;. The same year she wrote a series of pamphlets on a range of social concerns, such as illegitimate children. In these pamphlets she advanced the public debate on issues that would later be picked up by feminists, such as Flora Tristan. She continued to publish political essays between 1788 and 1791. Such as &quot;Cry of the wise man, by a woman&quot; in response to Louis XVI calling together the Estates-General.

De Gouges wrote her famous Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen shortly after the French Constitution of 1791 was ratified by King Louis XVI, and dedicated it to his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette. The French Constitution marked the birth of the short-lived constitutional monarchy and implemented a status based citizenship. Citizens were defined as men over 25 who were &quot;independent&quot; and who had paid the poll tax. These citizens had the right to vote. Furthermore, active citizenship was two-tiered, with those who could vote and those who were fit for public office. Women were by definition not afforded any rights of active citizenship. Like men who could not pay the poll tax, children, domestic servants, rural day-laborers and slaves, Jews, actors and hangmen, women had no political rights. In transferring sovereignty to the nation the constitution dismantled the old regime, but de Gouges argued that it did not go far enough.

De Gouges was not the only feminist who attempted to influence the political structures of late Enlightenment France. But like the writings of Etta Palm d&#x27;Aelders, Theroigne de Mericourt, Claire Lacombe, and Marquis de Condorcet, her arguments fell on deaf ears. At the end of the 18th century influential political actors such as Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès were not convinced of the case for equality.

In her early political letters de Gouges made a point of being a woman, and that she spoke &quot;as a woman&quot;. She addressed her public letters, published often as pamphlets, to statesmen such as Jacques Necker, the Duke of Orléans, or the queen Marie Antoinette. Like other pamphlet writers in revolutionary France, she spoke from the margins and spoke of her experience as a citizen with a desire to influence the ongoing public debate. In her letters she articulated the values of the Enlightenment, and commented on how they may be put into practice, such as civic virtue, universal rights, natural rights and political rights. In language and practice this was a debate among men and about men. Republicans discussed civic virtue in terms of patriotic manliness (&quot;la vertu mâle et répub-licaine&quot;). Women were not granted political rights in revolutionary France, thus de Gouges used her pamphlets to enter the public debate and she argued that the debate needed to include the female civic voice.

De Gouges signed her pamphlets with &quot;citoyenne&quot;. It has been suggested that she adopted this notion from Rousseau&#x27;s letter &quot;To the Republic of Geneva&quot;, where he speaks directly to two types of Genevans: the &quot;dear fellow citizens&quot; or his &quot;brothers&quot;, and the &quot;aimables et virtueses Citoyenne&quot;, that is the women citizens. In the public letter &quot;Remarques Patriotique&quot; from December 1788 de Gouges justified why she is publishing her political thoughts, arguing that &quot;This dream, strange though it may seem, will show the nation a truly civic heart, a spirit that is always concerned with the public good&quot;.

As the politics of revolutionary France changed and progressed de Gouges failed to become an actor on the political stage, but in her letters offered advice to the political establishment. Her proposition for a political order remained largely unchanged. She expresses faith in the Estates General and in reference to the estates of the realm, that the people of France (Third Estate) would be able to ensure harmony between the three estates, that is clergy, nobility and the people. Despite this she expresses loyalty for the ministers Jacques Necker and Charles Alexandre de Calonne. De Gouges opposes absolutism, but believed France should retain a constitutional monarchy.

In her open letter to Marie-Antoinette, de Gouges declared:

I could never convince myself that a princess, raised in the midst of grandeur, had all the vices of baseness... Madame, may a nobler function characterize you, excite your ambition, and fix your attention. Only one whom chance had elevated to an eminent position can assume the task of lending weight to the progress of the Rights of Woman and of hastening its success. If you were less well informed, Madame, I might fear that your individual interests would outweigh those of your sex. You love glory; think, Madame, the greatest crimes immortalize one as much as the greatest virtues, but what a different fame in the annals of history! The one is ceaselessly taken as an example, and the other is eternally the execration of the human race.

Public letters, or pamphlets, were the primary means for the working class and women writers to engage in the public debate of revolutionary France. The intention was not to court the favour of the addressee, often a public figure. Frequently these pamphlets were intended to stir up public anger. They were widely circulated within and outside France. De Gouges&#x27;s contemporary Madame Roland of the Gironde party became notorious for her &quot;Letter to Louis XVI&quot; in 1792. In the same year de Gouges penned &quot;Letter to Citizen Robespierre&quot;, which Maximilien Robespierre refused to answer. De Gouges took to the street, and on behalf of the French people proclaimed &quot;Let us plunge into the Seine! Thou hast need of a bath ... thy death will claim things, and as for myself, the sacrifice of a pure life will disarm the heavens.&quot;

==Legacy==

Although she was a celebrity in her lifetime and a prolific author, de Gouges became largely forgotten, but then rediscovered through a political biography by Olivier Blanc in the mid-1980s.

On 6 March 2004, the junction of the Rues Béranger, Charlot, de Turenne, and de Franche-Comté in Paris was proclaimed the Place Olympe de Gouges. The square was inaugurated by the mayor of the 3rd arrondissement, Pierre Aidenbaum, along with then first deputy mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo. The actress Véronique Genest read an excerpt from the Declaration of the Rights of Woman. 2007 French presidential contender Ségolène Royal expressed the wish that de Gouges&#x27;s remains be moved to the Panthéon. However, her remains—like those of the other victims of the Reign of Terror—have been lost through burial in communal graves, so any reburial (like that of Marquis de Condorcet) would be only ceremonial.

She is honoured in many street names across France, in the Salle Olympe de Gouges exhibition hall in rue Merlin, Paris, and the Parc Olympe de Gouges in Annemasse.

The 2018 play The Revolutionists by Lauren Gunderson centers on de Gouges and a dramatized version of her life as a playwright and activist during the Reign of Terror.

<doc id="407532" wikidata="Q1930578" url="?curid=407532" title="Northern Counties East Football League">
<text>The Northern Counties East Football League is a semi-professional English football league. It has two divisions – Premier Division and Division One – which stand at the ninth and tenth levels of the English football pyramid respectively.

==History==
The league was formed in 1982 following the merger of the Yorkshire League and Midland League. For its inaugural season, the league consisted of five divisions. Since then, the league has undergone several changes to the point where since 2018 it has two divisions of 20 teams.

The league has maintained promotion and relegation between its divisions since its beginning. In 2015 a series of play-offs were introduced for the first time to determine a third promotee from Division One.

The competition has several feeder leagues at level 11 of the pyramid, which may provide new member clubs each year:
* Central Midlands League North Division
* Humber Premier League Premier Division
* Lincolnshire League
* Sheffield and Hallamshire County Senior League Premier Division
* West Yorkshire League Premier Division
* York League Premier Division
* Yorkshire Amateur League Supreme Division
Clubs are also liable to be transferred to other leagues if the FA deems it geographically suitable to do so.

<text>San Antonio is a census-designated place in Socorro County, New Mexico, United States, roughly in the center of the state, on the Rio Grande.

==Description==
San Antonio is partly agricultural, and partly a bedroom community for Socorro.

San Antonio is the gateway to the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. Interstate 25 runs along the west, and U.S. Route 380 begins there and heads east to Carrizozo. The Rio Grande is just to the east of San Antonio, and the BNSF Railway runs through the community and has a small yard, little more than a siding.

While still part of the New Mexico Territory, the town was the birthplace of Conrad Hilton. His father was a merchant and hotelier in San Antonio, and Hilton learned the hotel trade there. Hilton was one of the original legislators in the newly formed state of New Mexico, and founded the Hilton Hotels Corporation.

San Antonio is about 28 miles from Trinity Site, where the first nuclear bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945. Residents reported tremors like an earthquake and the town received some of the remnants of the mushroom cloud, resulting in some radioactive contamination of the area, which faded quickly and does not persist today. The town was the meeting place for the scientists who detonated the bomb.

The city supports a few small businesses, which include the original Owl Bar and Cafe (featured on an episode of the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Burger Land&quot; in 2013), The Buckhorn Tavern (featured in 2009 on the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Throwdown! with Bobby Flay&quot;,), San Antonio Crane, a restaurant featuring Mexican food, a seasonal roadside market, and a general store.

On July 15, 2018, San Antonio was hit by a thunderstorm that caused the small town to be covered with up to 2 ft of mud. This event received an emergency declaration from Governor Martinez. Highway 380 after this event was impossible to traverse, and the force of the flood water swept off the train tracks at the Burlington-Northern Santa Fe Railroad at the 380 crossing. This event helped justify funding for building a retention pond, and coming up with other plans to prevent similar future floods.

==Education==
It is within Socorro Consolidated Schools. Socorro High School is the comprehensive high school of the district.

<text>USS &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; (SSBN-601), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Robert E. Lee (1807–1870), the commanding general of the Confederate forces during the American Civil War.

Her keel was laid down on 25 August 1958 by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 18 December 1959 sponsored by Anne Carter (Lee) Ely, a granddaughter of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and widow of Hanson Edward Ely, Jr., and commissioned on 16 September 1960 with Commander Reuben F. Woodal commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Joseph Williams, Jr. commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
===Shakedown and training===
The third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine to join the fleet, and the first nuclear-powered submarine built in the southern United States, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; operated in and out of Newport News, Virginia, until 2 December 1960, when she got underway for the Narragansett Bay Operating Area for torpedo firing tests. Following the successful firing of five torpedoes on 6 December 1960, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; departed for Cape Canaveral, Florida, arriving on 12 December 1960. She then loaded Polaris test missiles and on 22 December 1960 conducted her first missile launch. The Polaris flew &quot;hot and true.&quot;

In January 1961, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; conducted additional simulated missile launches and on 15 January 1961 departed for the Bermuda Operating Area. There, joined by the submarine on 25 January 1961, she engaged in antisubmarine warfare training with &quot;Torsk&quot;. Returning to Norfolk on 30 January, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; entered the Newport News drydock on 3 February for a month of shipyard work. She departed Newport News on 17 March 1961, loaded torpedoes at Yorktown, Virginia, on 25 March, and got underway for Cape Canaveral, arriving on 9 April 1961.

&quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; conducted &quot;special operations&quot; out of Cape Canaveral during May and June 1961, and in late June departed for Holy Loch, Scotland, where she joined Submarine Squadron 14 on 10 July 1961.

===Holy Loch deployment, 1961-1965===
She conducted practice torpedo firing during the first week of August and departed Holy Loch on 9 August 1961 on her first deterrent patrol. During the next two years she completed nine more deterrent patrols.

On 10 September 1963, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; entered the floating drydock , then on 4 October 1963 resumed her normal patrol schedule. Continuing to operate out of Holy Loch into 1964, she got underway on 27 November 1964 for her 16th patrol, which terminated on 28 January 1965 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California.

===First refit, 1965===
On 22 February 1965, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; entered the Mare Island Division of the San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard for her first overhaul. Major items of work included refueling the reactor, reengineering of many ship systems to provide greater safety and reliability, modernization of the navigation system, and modification to the weapons system to give her the capability of launching the improved Polaris A3 missile.

Emerging from overhaul after nearly a year and a half of work, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; got underway for sea trials on 12 July 1966. Sound trials and weapons system accuracy trials were conducted during the latter half of July, and on 5 August she entered San Diego, California, harbor for a five-day visit. Underway for the United States East Coast on 10 August 1966, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 20 August and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 4 September 1966.

During the remainder of September and the first week of October, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; conducted shakedown operations off Cape Canaveral, Florida. On 10 October, with the Undersecretary of the Navy on board as an observer, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; successfully fired a Polaris A-3 test missile. She returned to Charleston to commence a predeployment upkeep period at the Cooper River site in South Carolina where a failed rudder ram bolt was replaced. On 4 December 1966, she departed Charleston on her 17th deterrent patrol, which terminated at Holy Loch on 30 January 1967.

===Holy Loch, 1967-1971===
By 4 October 1967, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; had completed three more patrols. After drydocking in &quot;Los Alamos&quot; for minor repairs and hull surveillance, she resumed her patrol schedule on 1 November 1967 and completed her 21st patrol before entering drydock on 22 November 1967 for two weeks of repairs. She departed Holy Loch on 26 December 1967 for another patrol.

&quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; remained attached to Submarine Squadron 14 throughout 1969 and 1970. Continuing to operate out of Holy Loch, she completed her 33rd deterrent patrol on 1 January 1971.

===Second refit (1971)===
&quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; was drydocked for her second overhaul on 27 January 1971 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. She did not leave the drydock until 11 December 1971 and, afterward remained berthed at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for the remainder of 1971. For the first seven months of 1972, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; was engaged in post-overhaul trials and exercises on the United States West Coast.

===United States East Coast operations, 1972-1973===
In mid-August 1972, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; transited the Panama Canal and arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, on 14 September 1972. She continued normal operations, this time on the U.S. East Coast, throughout 1972 and for the first seven months of 1973.

===Pacific operations, 1973-1977===
Transiting the Panama Canal early in August 1973, she arrived in San Diego, California, on 17 August 1973 and then moved on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving on 5 September 1973. After a month in Hawaii, she sailed for Apra, Guam, and continued operations in that area into 1977, accomplishing several deterrent patrols in the Pacific.

===Third refit, 1977-1978===
In early 1977, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; drydocked for her third and final overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for nuclear reactor core refueling, equipment, and weapons upgrades. Sea Trials commenced in August 1978 and she went into operational status December, 1978.

===Operations 1978-1983===
The Gold Crew transited the Panama Canal January 1979. Transited to San Diego California, Bremerton, WA to Honolulu, HI. Turned over to the Blue Crew.
In 1982-1983, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;″s missiles were removed and she was redesignated SSN 601.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; was decommissioned on 1 December 1983, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1986. Her hulk was stored at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard until it entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program. On 30 September 1991, it ceased to exist.

<text>OGRE is a science fiction board wargame designed by the American game designer Steve Jackson and published by Metagaming Concepts in 1977 as the first microgame in its MicroGame line. When Jackson left Metagaming to form his own company, he took the rights to &quot;OGRE&quot; with him, and all subsequent editions have been produced by Steve Jackson Games (SJG).

==Game description==

&quot;OGRE&quot; is an asymmetrical two-player wargame set in the late 21st century that pits a single giant robot tank called an &quot;OGRE&quot; against the second player&#x27;s headquarters, defended by a mixture of conventional units, including tanks, infantry, and artillery.

During each player&#x27;s turn, they may move their unit(s), then engage in combat with the opponent&#x27;s unit(s) if the movement has brought those unit(s) in range of the weapons on the moved unit(s). After the combat has been resolved by rolling a die for each encounter, the specialized &quot;Ground Effect Vehicle&quot; units may be moved a second time; play then passes to the other player. Victory conditions vary by scenario, but for the OGRE player, the objective generally includes destroying the defender&#x27;s command post and sometimes also eliminating their forces, and for the defender, the objective is to destroy the OGRE.

===Components===

The game components of the original 1977 edition published by Metagaming include a hex map printed in black-and-white; 112 square counters, each on a side, representing military units and machines printed on sheets of cardboard (but not fully die-cut); and a 20-page rulebook.

The original hex map depicts a battleground of barren terrain with obstacles including raised ridgelines between some adjacent hex cells and large, radioactive craters occupying a full hex cell. The board is 15 hex cells wide and was reduced from 25 to 22 rows with the second edition. In addition, the second edition updated the map with crater graphics. The 1982 edition published by Steve Jackson Games upgraded the map to color printed on glossy paper and expanded the rulebook to 40 pages, but retained similar semi-die-cut counters.

===Units===
In the original game, the player defending against the OGRE may select from four conventional armor units, in addition to Infantry:
* Heavy Tank
* Missile Tank
* GEV (Ground Effect Vehicle)
* Howitzer

Infantry units may be stacked in groups of up to 3 squads, and Infantry counters are provided in corresponding values of 1-, 2-, and 3-squad units. Each conventional unit (including Infantry) carries numerical ratings for attack, defense, and movement, which are marked on the counter corresponding to that unit as follows:
:/ D M
where
* = attack strength
* = striking distance / range
* D = defense strength
* M = movement points

The OGRE carries similar attack, range, and defense ratings for each of its weapon systems, and a single movement point rating for the OGRE vehicle itself. OGRE movement ability is determined by its remaining tread points, with damage to the treads resulting in a proportional reduction to available movement points.



===Setup===
The defender sets up their forces in the more congested northern part of the map; the OGRE controlled by the other player enters the opposite side of the map at the beginning of the game. The map is divided into Northern (rows 7 and lower), Central (rows 8 through 15), and Southern (rows 16 and higher) regions; the defender is required to place their units in the Northern and Central areas, with restrictions on the initial total strength in the Central area, and the OGRE starts from the Southern edge of the map (row 21 or 22).

Several scenarios are provided with the game. Since its initial release, additional scenarios have been described in expansion sets and gaming magazines. The basic version of the game has the attacker using a single OGRE heavy tank (referred to as a &quot;Mark III OGRE&quot;), while the advanced scenario gives the attacker the larger, more powerful &quot;Mark V OGRE&quot; tank versus an increased number of defenders. In either scenario, the defender is given a budget to select several infantry, based on total attack power, and a total number of &#x27;armor units&#x27;, but the defender is free to choose the exact composition of their own forces, staying within the budget. For example, the defender in the standard (Mark III) scenario is allowed to select any combination of infantry which total 20 attack points, and 12 armor units, counted as one per unit (e.g., one heavy tank is counted as one armor unit) except Howitzers, which count as two units each.

===Movement===
Each piece has a movement factor which indicates the number of hexes it can move each turn, although certain types of terrain can penalize this. While craters are impassable for all units, infantry and OGREs may cross ridgelines. Maps from later editions of the game have additional features and obstacles that also affect movement.

Most units are restricted to a single move &amp; shoot phase during each turn (move phase first, then combat phase). There are two notable exceptions: GEVs (&quot;ground effect vehicles&quot;, which are heavily armored hovercraft) can move both before and after combat, and the OGRE can ram into an enemy unit during its movement phase, possibly destroying the defender.

===Combat===

Attacks are resolved by comparing the attacking unit&#x27;s strength to the defending unit&#x27;s defense strength and rolling a standard (six-sided) die. The attacker must designate a target. All units attacking the same target can combine their attack factors. Likewise, the player of the OGRE can combine the attack factors of its different weapon systems if aimed at the same target. When defending, adjacent or stacked units are considered separate targets and cannot combine their defense factors. In the OGRE, each system is considered a separate target.

The ratio of attack to defense factors are rounded in favor of the defender, and then is looked up in a combat results table with the die roll. For infantry and armor units, there are three possible outcomes: no effect (NE), disabled (D: armor units lose their next turn, and infantry units are decremented by one squad), or destroyed (X). When attacking OGRE weapon systems, there are only two outcomes: no effect or destroyed; the disabled result is considered the same as no effect for OGRE systems.

===Strategy===
The different types of units available to the defender encourage a combined-arms approach with each type being better than the others in different aspects. Heavy tanks have high attack and defense with moderate speed and low range. Missile tanks have moderate attack and defense with moderate range and low speed. GEVs have very high speed (moving twice per turn), low attack, low range, and moderate defense. Howitzers have very high attack and range but are easily destroyed (once an attacker has managed to get close enough), immobile, and expensive. However, according to the game&#x27;s designer, this balanced mix of units was not quite right in the first edition; the second edition sped up heavy tanks, slowed down GEVs, and changed the defender&#x27;s purchasing from &quot;attack factors&quot; to &quot;armor units&quot; (everything is considered equivalent, except howitzers, which are worth two of anything else).

==Publication history==
 In 1960, science fiction author Keith Laumer wrote &quot;Combat Unit&quot;, the first of many short stories and novellas about large, semi-intelligent tanks called &quot;Bolos&quot;. These stories and Colin Kapp&#x27;s short story &quot;Gottlos&quot; (1969) were major influences in the development of &quot;OGRE&quot;.

&quot;OGRE&quot; was designed by American game designer Steve Jackson and published by Metagaming Concepts in 1977 featuring artwork by Winchell Chung. Jackson said his concept arose from the limitations of the &quot;Microgame&quot; format: &quot; Thinking about writing a scenario using maybe 30 counters and just a few hexes, it hit me: give one side &quot;one&quot; counter. One &quot;big&quot; counter. After that, it started to fall into place.&quot; The game proved popular, and Metagaming quickly released a second edition later the same year, aimed at improving the game&#x27;s balance, with a much larger print run and rulebook artwork by Clark Bradley rather than Chung.

===Steve Jackson Games===
When Steve Jackson left Metagaming to found Steve Jackson Games (SJG), he took the rights to &quot;OGRE&quot; with him and published a new (third) edition in 1982. This third edition featured double-sided counters and reused the Bradley artwork from the second edition; unlike the Metagaming MicroGames, which were housed in a plastic zipper storage bag, the third edition came in a &quot;Pocket Box&quot; clamshell. The board now used a color sheet with artwork by Denis Loubet.

In 1987, SJG released &quot;OGRE: Deluxe Edition&quot;. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration that was also used for the &quot;OGRE&quot; computer game (see Spinoffs below). The board was printed on a folding cardboard base, sturdier than the previous edition&#x27;s paper map, and the counters were provided with stand-up plastic bases. &quot;Games&quot; magazine listed the Deluxe Edition as one of its best games of the year.

In 1990, &quot;OGRE&quot; was combined with &quot;G.E.V.&quot; in a single &quot;OGRE/G.E.V.&quot; box. The &quot;OGRE&quot; rules were designated as the 4th edition and the &quot;G.E.V.&quot; rules were designated as the 3rd edition. The combined &quot;OGRE/G.E.V.&quot; game was released using a single box, and the rules were combined into a single two-way booklet, with the rule for one game printed in one direction; the booklet was flipped over to see the other rules. The box for the combined &quot;OGRE/G.E.V.&quot; was redesigned and the game received a limited re-release in 1995. In 2000, &quot;OGRE/G.E.V.&quot; was released again and designated as the 5th edition, with new cover art by Phillip Reed, sold in a VHS box, but rules still in a 4&quot; x 7&quot;, 44-page booklet and counters in black, red and white (2-sided).

In 2011 Steve Jackson announced a sixth edition, &quot;The OGRE Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, combining &quot;OGRE&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot; with larger full-color flat counters for most units and constructible cardboard figures for the Ogres. In May 2012, the new &quot;Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot; was funded on Kickstarter, and the game was produced in 2013, with a cover illustrated by Philip Reed, containing five folding map boards, more than 500 counters, and 72 constructible 3-D OGREs and buildings. Numerous accessories were released at the same time, providing additional counters and scenarios. A new &quot;Pocket Edition&quot; of &quot;OGRE&quot; also was released in 2013, packaged in a resealable plastic bag, similar to the original (1977) MicroGames, and with a rulebook bearing the original artwork from Winchell Chung. The new Pocket Edition uses the original unit types with a version of the sixth edition rules modified to suit. A separate Sixth Edition boxed boardgame was released in December 2016, providing the updated rules and units from the Designer&#x27;s Edition at a more affordable price.

In 2020, SJG released an updated pocket box version of &quot;OGRE&quot; with a 16-page manual and 112 counters, along with updated pocket box versions of G.E.V., Battlesuit, and Shockwave. In 2021, as part of a Kickstarter campaign, SJG released the &quot;1976 OGRE Playtest Booklet,&quot; a reproduction of the original typewritten rules and hand-drawn counters and map that were used during playtesting the first version of OGRE.

===Other in-universe boardgames===
Steve Jackson created a sequel, &quot;G.E.V.&quot; (1978), which is compatible with &quot;OGRE&quot; and adds terrain effects on movement, new units, and rules for stacking units on a single hex cell. After leaving Metagaming to form SJG, Jackson also designed and published &quot;Battlesuit&quot; (1983), which is set in the same fictional universe as &quot;OGRE&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot;, but concentrates on person-to-person battles instead and is not cross-compatible with the earlier games.

&quot;Ogre Miniatures&quot; is a book first published in 1992 with a cover illustrated by Jeff Mangiat; this included the rules for both &quot;OGRE&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot; and revised them to use miniatures instead of counters, by changing weapon ranges from hex cells to physical measurements in inches and describing a rescaled map to suit miniatures. A &quot;new&quot; &quot;Deluxe OGRE&quot; (2000) was a re-issue of &quot;OGRE Miniatures&quot;, bundled with miniatures, and the original &quot;crater&quot; map was re-printed on a larger scale.

===Expansions===
There have been three major expansions to &quot;OGRE&quot;, each adding new units and rules, since its initial release: &quot;Shockwave&quot; (1984), &quot;Reinforcement Pack&quot; (1985), and &quot;Battlefields&quot; (2000).

Steve Jackson promised an expansion to &quot;OGRE&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot; for Origins &#x27;83; the first expansion, &quot;Shockwave&quot;, was released in 1984, packaged in a familiar plastic zipper bag. &quot;Shockwave&quot; added many new units and buildings, including corresponding counters, and came with a map designed to be placed adjacent to any side of the map included in &quot;G.E.V.&quot;, expanding the playing surface. The next expansion was the &quot;Ogre Reinforcement Pack&quot;, released in 1985, which mainly included replacements for lost counters and maps from the prior releases of &quot;OGRE&quot;, &quot;G.E.V.&quot;, and &quot;Shockwave&quot;, but also included a few new rules for towing. In 1987, the magazine &quot;Space Gamer&quot; published a rule expansion, allowing players to design an OGRE.

Steve Jackson announced he was developing the &quot;Ogre Battlefields&quot; expansion in February 2000, and released it in January 2001; &quot;Battlefields&quot; includes new maps and specialized Militia and Engineer Infantry units. In late 2018, SJG ran a Kickstarter for a new &quot;OGRE Battlefields&quot;, an update and expansion for both the Designer&#x27;s Edition and the Sixth Edition.

==Reception==
In the April–June 1977 edition &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 11), Robert C. Kirk concluded that the 1977 edition of &quot;&quot;OGRE&quot; is attractive, easy to learn, inexpensive, and fun to play. What more can a gamer ask?&quot; In the next edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, William A. Peterson commented that &quot;It is fast, simple, and fun. Its bad points, while annoying, can be ignored.&quot;

In Issue 11 of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Tony Watson wrote, &quot;The nice thing about OGRE is that after you’ve played a game there’s usually time for one more. Thus, you can rectify perceived flaws in your defense or experiment with a new mix or set-up immediately, while the new ideas are still fresh in your mind. Such experimentation is always interesting, and certainly the best way to learn good play.&quot; Seven issues later, Jerry Eperson called &quot;OGRE&quot; &quot;one of those games that get their hook into you the minute you play them [...] But hidden in the game are small subtleties that can only be found after playing &quot;OGRE&quot; several times.&quot;

In the August–September 1977 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 2), Martin Easterbrook began his review of Metagaming Concepts&#x27; original 1977 edition by saying &quot;Be warned: this game could become a craze&quot; adding that &quot;the idea of the microgames themselves is remarkable enough in itself&quot;. He gave the game an above-average rating of 8 out of 10 but criticized the game&#x27;s title and &quot;flimsy equipment, weak infantry&quot;.

In the inaugural edition of &quot;Ares&quot; (March 1980), David Ritchie gave the game a &quot;very good&quot; rating of 7 out of 9, commenting, &quot;The first of the MicroGames, &quot;OGRE&quot; started an avalanche of small, fast, playable games [...] A Panzer freak&#x27;s ultimate dream.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman commented, &quot;It is ridiculously inexpensive — almost disposable. Despite its size and price, it is well produced and reasonably presented.&quot; Freeman thought its best value, though, was in its gameplay: &quot;Most significantly, it&#x27;s an exceptionally fast and interesting game.&quot; He noted the game&#x27;s drawbacks were minor and gave this game an Overall Evaluation of &quot;Excellent&quot;, concluding, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the best values in gaming.&quot;

In the October 1980 issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot;, game designer Greg Costikyan wrote, &quot;&quot;OGRE&quot;″s success, I think, is largely due to its successful mating of two of gaming’s most popular subjects — science fiction and the tank. This should not be taken as belittling the game, however, because OGRE is tense, fast-playing and a close match right down to the last die-roll. One of the comments frequently heard when it first came out was an expression of surprise that the game was of such high quality despite its small size and low cost; a lot of &#x27;bang for your buck&#x27;.&quot;

In Issue 30 of &quot;Phoenix&quot; (March–April 1981), Michael Stoner thought the counters of the original Metagaming Concepts edition were flimsy and sometimes difficult to read, but otherwise called &quot;OGRE&quot; &quot;an excellent &#x27;fun&#x27; game, taking less than an hour to play and easy to teach.&quot;

In the August 1982 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 64), Tony Watson reviewed the first reissue by Steve Jackson Games, and called &quot;OGRE&quot; &quot;a legend in the ranks of SF gamedom, and deservedly so... as well as being a lot of fun to play, it&#x27;s an interesting extrapolation on high-tech armored warfare&quot;. Watson noted that the rules had remained essentially the same in the new edition, the most significant changes being to the physical design—with larger (still black and white) counters, and full-color maps by Denis Loubet. Watson also welcomed the retention of the original artwork alongside new pieces — &quot;no one draws a GEV or OGRE like Mr. Chung&quot;. He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying it &quot;would make a fine addition to any gamer&#x27;s collection.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Ogre: Deluxe Edition&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #9 (1988), rating it a 9 out of 10 and stated that &quot;Easy to learn and quick to play (less than an hour per game on the average), &quot;OGRE&quot; comes well recommended by many (including myself).&quot;

In the April 1989 edition of &quot;G.M.&quot; (Vol. 1, Issue 8), Johnny Razor reviewed &quot;OGRE: Deluxe Edition&quot; and highlighted the game&#x27;s ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.

In the August 1991 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 172), Allen Varney reviewed the combined &quot;OGRE&quot;/&quot;G.E.V.&quot; edition of 1991, and stated, &quot;[The] two simulation board games of armored combat on a future battlefield are among the best the field has ever seen: fast, elegant, and endlessly replayable&quot;. While praising the production values of the 2-color playing pieces, Varney found the box somewhat &#x27;flimsy&#x27;. He concluded, &quot;These twin classics shouldn&#x27;t be missed.&quot;

&quot;OGRE&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Game designer Erick Wujcik commented &quot; I think [&quot;OGRE&quot;″s] success really boils down to four essentials: &quot;OGRE&quot; is fast, ... asymmetrical, ... open-ended, ... [and] is a teaching tool. &quot;OGRE&quot; had restructured my mind pretty completely ... but it wasn&#x27;t until 2002 ... that I realized how effective &quot;OGRE&quot; is at getting across so many important component mechanisms of play and design [...] Gameplay summons to mind a futuristic nightmare of desperation and exhilaration, where rumbling machines unleash barrage after barrage of titanic weaponry and the inexorable advance of a soulless giant can only be stopped by zinging swarms of self-sacrificing martyrs.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Ogre&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, John ONeill said &quot;When you sat down to play a game of &quot;Ogre&quot;, you weren&#x27;t just pushing cheap cardboard counters across a piece of paper, and rolling a d6 you stole from your sister&#x27;s &quot;Clue&quot; game. You were a participant in a mini theater of the imagination. The stakes were perilously high for your human defenders as they valiantly surged across the blasted landscape towards an unstoppable enemy of mankind, and almost certain death. Every game brought surprises, and the kind of high drama and excitement that kept you and your friends talking for days — or at least until the next time the board came out.&quot;
