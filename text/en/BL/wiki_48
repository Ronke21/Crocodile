<text>AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, is an interest group in the United States focusing on issues affecting those 50 and older. The organization, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C., said it had more than 38 million members as of 2018. The magazine and bulletin it sends to its members are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States.

AARP was formed in 1958 by Ethel Percy Andrus, a retired educator from California, and Leonard Davis, who later founded Colonial Penn&#x27;s insurance companies. It is an influential lobbying group in the United States. AARP sells paid memberships, and markets insurance and other services to its members.

==Overview==
AARP is a nonpartisan 501(c)(4) nonprofit that advocates for older Americans on a number of federal health and fiscal issues such as Medicare and Social Security, and at the state and local level for better community healthcare services and lower utility rates. It fights age discrimination in the workforce, lobbies for lower prescription drug prices, and educates seniors about consumer fraud through the AARP Fraud Watch Network.

AARP also advocates at the state and local level for better community healthcare services and lower utility rates. It has millions of volunteer activists and offices in every state, including Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

Through affiliated organizations such as the AARP Foundation, AARP helps seniors with legal assistance, tax preparation, job training, and personal finance.

Members receive AARP Magazine and the AARP Bulletin, the top-circulating consumer publications in the country, along with special offers and discounts related to travel, restaurants, prescriptions, and more. A full AARP membership is available to those 50 and older; however, those under 50 can also join.

AARP licenses its brand to certain products, including Medicare insurance with UnitedHealthcare. A volunteer board of directors oversees the organization.

According to its 2018 Consolidated Financial Statement, the largest sources of income were:
* royalties for the rights to use AARP&#x27;s intellectual property (name, logo, etc.) paid by commercial providers of products, services, and discounts for AARP members $908,960,000;
* membership dues $301,017,000;
* advertisements placed in its publications $147,687,000; and
* total operating revenue $1,648,795,000 

==History==
===20th century===
AARP was founded in 1958 by Ethel Percy Andrus, a retired California public school teacher and principal.

Andrus had been an advocate for health insurance coverage for retired teachers. Volunteering with the California Retired Teachers Association (CRTA), Andrus sought out former teachers who were struggling on their $40/month state pensions. Her goal was to get them out of poverty and access to affordable health insurance.

In 1944, Andrus checked on a former Spanish teacher who was ill and found her living in a chicken coop. Like many other retirees at the time, her pension was not enough to afford adequate housing or healthcare. Before Medicare was enacted in 1965, no national program existed in the United States to provide health insurance to people aged 65 and older. At the same time, many states enforced mandatory retirement, forcing people to leave their jobs and forfeit health coverage. The poverty rate for Americans 65 and older was 35 percent higher than any other age group. Shocked by what she saw, Andrus helped the teacher get the care she needed and began searching for ways to improve older adults&#x27; health and financial security.

In 1947, Andrus formed the National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA) to secure affordable group health coverage. She met with 42 private insurance companies who deemed adults over 65 to be &quot;uninsurable&quot; and was rejected each time. The policy that Andrus had in mind covered individuals aged 65 and older, with no exclusions for pre-existing health conditions. Leonard Davis, an insurance broker from New York, offered to work with Andrus to develop a pilot program for retired teachers in New York. The experiment was a financial success, and he and Andrus teamed up to establish a national version – the NRTA Health Plan insured by Continental Casualty Co. in 1955. In 1958, the American Association of Retired Persons Membership (AARP) was incorporated and reached 130,000 in its first year.

The NRTA/AARP insurance model was the first in the United States to open a new insurance market for older Americans. AARP expanded beyond health insurance and began developing other benefits, programs, and services for its members, each tailored to the needs of people aged 55 and older and filling a market gap. For example, she created one of the first modern retirement homes, Grey Gables, in Ojai, California, in 1954, designed to keep older residents healthy, active, and socially engaged.

Word about the NRTA Health Plan spread, and thousands of retired non-educators who also faced challenges finding health coverage contacted the NRTA about joining. In 1958, Andrus created the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) as a sister organization to NRTA. Through membership in AARP, the general population age 55 and older gained access to the insurance benefits previously limited to former teachers.

In 1958, AARP began publishing its magazine called &quot;Modern Maturity&quot; to spread the word about the association, keep members informed of its activities, and publicize issues affecting older adults.

National concern about pharmaceutical industry practices at this time prompted U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver (D-Tenn), who chaired the Senate Judiciary Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee, to lead a congressional investigation into prescription drug prices, which lasted from 1959 to 1962. Andrus testified four times during the investigation, and NRTA/AARP legislative director Ernest Gidding testified once.

In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation creating the first White House Conference on Aging. He named Andrus to the National Advisory Committee for the first conference, held in 1961. More than 2,500 delegates met in Washington, D.C. over four days to address challenges facing older adults such as poverty, housing, and healthcare, and develop policy recommendations for the administration. White House conferences on aging have been held every decade since the first and are credited with making contributions to U.S. aging policy, including laying the groundwork for Medicare.

At the first conference, AARP spotlighted a potential solution to the growing issue of older adults with mobility problems living independently. It constructed the House of Freedom in downtown Washington, D.C., the nation&#x27;s first universal design home easily accessible by older adults and people with disabilities. It was built by AARP and the Douglas Fir Plywood Association and signaled the beginning of AARP&#x27;s work to help older Americans remain independent in their own homes and neighborhoods for as long as they wanted.

By 1962, the combined membership of AARP and NRTA had grown to 400,000, making it one of the largest membership organizations in the United States.

In 1963, Leonard Davis bought out Continental Casualty&#x27;s AARP/NRTA insurance policies and formed Colonial Penn, his own company, which became the sole provider of insurance to AARP/NRTA.

In 1968, AARP launched Tax-Aide, which matched low and moderate-income people with trained volunteers who provided free tax preparation and filing services.

As AARP grew, it expanded the range of benefits offered to its members. It established a travel service that took members on modestly priced domestic and international trips, created a retired senior volunteer program, and offered a range of discounts.

Increasingly, AARP&#x27;s members were asking the organization to take on age discrimination in the marketplace. Hundreds of members wrote to AARP in the early years, explaining that auto insurers and rental companies were charging punishing rates for older drivers, classifying them as high-risk and reckless just because of their age. AARP challenged the insurers and rental companies with research that demonstrated drivers over the age of 65 were among the safest.

In 1979, the organization began offering a driver safety course for any licensed driver, taught by volunteers. In 2016, the AARP Driver Safety Program taught 360,000 older drivers in classrooms and another 130,000 through its online course. Some who take the training receive discounts on their insurance premiums. In 1984, AARP licensed its brand name to affordable auto insurance that members could purchase and could not be canceled solely because of age.

In 1973, AARP created a charitable affiliate, the AARP Andrus Foundation, to award research grants in gerontology.

Andrus continued to run AARP until 1967 when she died of a heart attack at age 82. Today, the NRTA is a division within AARP. She wrote her final column for &quot;Modern Maturity&quot; four days before she died.

In 1975, AARP had over seven million members, making it one of the largest membership organizations in the country. In 1977, it enrolled its ten millionth member. By the end of the 1980s, membership nearly tripled to 33 million and AARP mailings were so large that the organization had its own zip code. It had tens of thousands of volunteers, the highest circulation magazine in the nation, and rising national awareness. In 1997, it topped &quot;Fortune&#x27;s&quot; first annual list of the most powerful lobbying organizations.

In 1984, AARP reduced its membership age from 55 to 50. It began sending &quot;birthday&quot; cards and membership invitations to Americans approaching their 50th birthday.

During this phase of rapid growth for AARP, competing insurance providers entered the marketplace, selling plans tailored to retired Americans. With more competition, the quality of Colonial Penn&#x27;s offerings and the nature of AARP&#x27;s relationship with Colonial Penn came into question.

In 1982, NRTA formally merged with AARP. In 1988, it formed a career planning workshop for older Americans who were unemployed and introduced a series of AARP mutual funds in 1997.

By the mid-1990s, telemarketing fraud had become pervasive and cost consumers more than $40 billion annually. A 1995 AARP survey found that more than half of all victims were aged 50 or older, a group that comprised less than one-third of the U.S. population. In 1995, working with the National Association of Attorneys General and the FBI, AARP helped expose a series of boiler room operations targeting thousands of potential phone fraud victims across the country. Acting as victims, AARP members volunteered to collect evidence for the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Operation Senior Sentinel targeting illegal telemarketers. In 1996, 78 million baby boomers began turning 50, contributing to AARP&#x27;s growth.

In 1999, the organization changed from the American Association of Retired Persons to AARP, dropping the word &quot;retirement.&quot; At the time, a third of AARP&#x27;s members were still in the workforce. AARP no longer requires that members be retired, and there are no longer any age restrictions even for full membership.

===21st century===
Recognizing the changing circumstances of its membership, AARP began offering more work-related tools and resources and ramped up its advocacy against age discrimination in the workplace. Beginning in 2009, AARP backed the &quot;Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act&quot; (POWADA), which aims to restore fairness for workers aged 40 and over by treating age discrimination as seriously as other forms of workplace discrimination. As of 2020, POWADA has been passed by the House of Representatives and is with the Senate.

In 2017, the organization created an online jobs board to connect job seekers over 50 with employers. AARP also created an employer pledge program, where more than 1,000 employers—including Google and CVS—promised to adhere to a set of age-friendly hiring and employment practices.

In 2018, AARP Foundation lawyers represented two employees of the Ohio State University who were forced out of their jobs because of their age. This action resulted in a settlement that helped the employees regain their positions and receive back pay. It required the university to hold training sessions with its staff on preventing age bias.

AARP has advocated for the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) since its passage in 1967, which protects workers at or over the age of 40 from bias in the workplace.

Myechia Minter-Jordan, a public health advocate and physician, was named as the next CEO of the organization in November 2024.

=== Economic security ===
Facing growing pension obligations and high annual health cost increases, American businesses in the 2000s began scaling back their retirement and health benefits to employees. While 35 percent of private-sector workers had a defined benefit pension in the 1990s, only 18 percent did in 2013. Beginning in 2004, AARP opposed attempts to undermine the guaranteed nature of the Social Security program through privatization or diverting Social Security payroll taxes to private accounts.

AARP&#x27;s research indicates that nearly half (57 million) of American workers have no access to a retirement savings plan through their employers. Through its state offices, the organization began advocating individual states to enact work and save programs, which made it easier for businesses to create a private retirement savings account for employees. As of 2020, eighteen states had signed Work and Save programs into law.

=== Health care ===
Continuing a theme that began at its founding, AARP during this period used its lobbying efforts to advocate against reductions in Medicare benefits and to protect the federal program that offered health coverage to older Americans.

In 2003, AARP supported legislation proposed by Republican President George W. Bush that included partial coverage for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, among other things. Democratic congressional leaders, seeking a more generous benefit, strongly opposed the bill and prompted thousands of AARP members to quit in protest. Six years later, in 2009, AARP endorsed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) proposed by Democratic President Barack Obama, which protected those with pre-existing health conditions, limited the amount that insurance companies could charge because of age, provided tax credits, and improved drug coverage in Medicare. At that time, more than 50 million Americans were without health insurance coverage at some point during the year. The ACA, which passed a year later, was opposed by Republicans and AARP&#x27;s support prompted thousands of members to leave the organization.

In 2019, with the price of prescription drugs far outpacing inflation, AARP began lobbying for legislative and industry changes to lower prescription medication costs. AARP supported a bipartisan bill by Sens. Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) that set caps on drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries and increased pressure on drug companies to lower prices.

That year, AARP also supported the Trump administration&#x27;s goal of allowing Americans to import lower-cost drugs from other countries. In 2021, the organization backed a House Democratic bill that, among other things, would allow Medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate lower drug prices with manufacturers. AARP backed legislation proposed by President Biden and passed by Congress in 2022 that would enable Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices, set caps on out-of-pocket drug spending by those on Medicare and capped the price for insulin at $35.

=== Brain health ===
In 2016, the organization created Staying Sharp, a program that allowed people to evaluate their brain health through a scientifically based assessment and receive tips for slowing cognitive decline. In 2018, AARP invested $60 million in the Dementia Discovery Fund, which supports research into diagnosis, treatments, and cures for dementia.

==Advocacy==
===Health care===
AARP has been active in healthcare policy debates since the 1960s. Its focus areas have included Medicare, affordable health insurance, and lower prescription drug costs and its recent engagement is a reflection of this long-standing involvement.

=== Medicare ===
AARP testified before Congress in support of the Older Americans Act and the amendments to Social Security that created the Medicare Program, which President Johnson enacted into law in 1965.

AARP&#x27;s public stances influenced the United States Congress&#x27; passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D, in 2003, and also influenced Congress by resisting changes to Social Security in 2005. President George W. Bush called the Medicare legislation &quot;the greatest advance in health care coverage for America&#x27;s seniors since the founding of Medicare.&quot; In 2007, AARP launched the &quot;Divided We Fail&quot; campaign with the Business Roundtable, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Service Employees International Union. The campaign urged presidential candidates in both major parties to commit to making health insurance coverage more affordable and to strengthen Social Security.

=== Lower prescription drug costs ===
As early as 1959, AARP began advocating for lower prescription drug costs to ease the burden on older consumers. Founder Ethel Percy Andrus testified during the 1962 Senate hearings on pharmaceutical industry pricing practices. &quot;Our concern is relief from suffering and improvement of health. We feel that 15 to 20 percent profit earned by several large manufacturers is detrimental to this concern,&quot; Andrus told the committee in 1962. AARP regularly publishes Rx Price Watch Reports noting pricing trends in popular drugs for seniors.

From 2018 to 2019, AARP helped pass more than 35 laws aimed at lowering drug prices at the local level.

In early 2017, AARP strongly opposed the American Health Care Act of 2017, saying that older Americans would be unfairly burdened with higher premiums and smaller tax credits.

In 2019, AARP mounted a multi-million dollar campaign against the pharmaceutical industry and its high drug prices called &quot;Stop Rx Greed&quot; and supported a bipartisan bill by Sens. Charles Grassley (R-IA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) that set caps on drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries and increased pressure on drug companies to lower prices. In 2021, AARP launched the &quot;Fair Rx Prices Now!&quot; Campaign to support legislation enabling the Medicare Program to negotiate prices with drug companies to lower prices for consumers, limit price increases for certain drugs, and cap out-of-pocket spending by Medicare beneficiaries.

AARP pushed Congress to include drug pricing reform in the proposed Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, ran ads countering drug industry claims, and mobilized its members to lobby their representatives to pass the bill. The Act was signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act requires HHS, for the first time, to negotiate prices with drug makers for many of the most expensive drugs covered under Medicare. It also penalizes drug companies that raise prices more than the inflation rate and sets a cap of $2,000 on annual out-of-pocket drug spending for Medicare&#x27;s more than 63 million beneficiaries beginning in 2025. These provisions in the act could be life-changing for older Americans who rely on high-priced prescription drugs, saving some thousands of dollars a year.

In a 2014 study conducted by AARP, 93% of people identified maintaining brain health as a high priority as they age. AARP created a brain health assessment and program called Staying Sharp and it formed the Global Council on Brain Health – an independent, international group of brain health experts and researchers that publishes findings such as the impact of music on brain health. In 2018, AARP donated $60 million to the Dementia Discovery Fund for research into the causes and treatments of Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.

In 2022, AARP held &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Expensive Tailgate&quot; to highlight problems with rising drug prices. The organization shared what popular tailgate items would cost if their prices had increased at the same rate as drug prices over the last 15 years.

===Health insurance===

Approximately seven million people have AARP-branded health insurance, including drug coverage and Medigap, as of April 2007 and the association earns more income from selling insurance to members its businesses through licensing arrangements than from membership dues.

While AARP is not an insurer, it allows its name to be used by insurance companies in the sale of products, for which it is paid a commission.

Congressional members have sometimes accused AARP of having a conflict of interest in taking sides over health insurance debates. AARP licenses its brand to United Healthcare which sells Medigap policies. As of October 2009, health care reform contained a proposal to trim an associated program Medicare Advantage, which was expected to increase demand for Medigap policies.

===Social Security===
AARP has long been an advocate for preserving Social Security as a safety net for older Americans. Since March 2012, AARP&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Earned a Say&quot; campaign has sought to foster nonpartisan conversations about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. The Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch reported: &quot;AARP took the debate about Medicare and Social Security from what it called behind closed doors in Washington to a series of town hall meetings around the country to make sure retirees have a voice in the discussion.&quot;

In 2023, AARP started campaigning for the Social Security Administration (SSA) to receive a $1.4 billion increase in funding to improve its &quot;woeful&quot; customer service. The AARP also called for the SSA to &quot;step up non-monetary measures to improve customer service and quality,&quot; stating that all issues won&#x27;t be resolved with more funding alone.

In the summer of 2023, AARP held a series of nationwide forums to help educate people about social security and debunk social security myths. The forum in Richmond was held alongside The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM).

===Age discrimination===

AARP advocated for the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. A 2020 joint project with The Economist Intelligence Unit reported that age discrimination cost the U.S. $850 billion in lost gross domestic product in 2018. In 2020, AARP supported the passage of the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA), which aimed to restore protections under the Age Discrimination Employment Act that were adversely affected by a 2009 Supreme Court decision.

In 2018, AARP worked to change how older people are portrayed in media and advertising to reduce age discrimination. The organization spoke against stock photos portraying people who are 50+ as confused or incapable and pressed advertising agencies and their clients to update their portrayals of aging. AARP worked with Getty Images to introduce 1,400 images of older people running businesses, playing sports, and spending time with younger generations. The photos were part of the Disrupt Aging Collection.

In 2018,  the organization also spoke out against employers who use age-specific targeting features on online platforms, denying all age groups the ability to see job opportunities.

The AARP Employer Pledge program is for employers who publicly pledge to work to end ageism. To join the program, employers must not have any discrimination lawsuits within the past five years and must agree to recruit across diverse age groups and consider all applications equally. In 2022, there were over 1,000 signees, including Humana, Microsoft, Marriott International, and McDonald&#x27;s.

=== Consumer fraud protection ===
In 2017 the AARP and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service launched Operation Protect Veterans. This national campaign uses local outreach, ads, emails, social media, a website, and phone calls to warn the military about scams.

The AARP Fraud Watch Network holds &quot;reverse boiler rooms&quot; to help warn people about consumer scams and teach them how to protect themselves. During these events, AARP volunteers call local residents to make them aware of fraud risks. Similar AARP events include Tip-Offs to Rip-Offs and the Scam Jam.

=== Local advocacy ===
AARP also advocates on the state and local levels through its offices around the country.  

In New York, AARP helped achieve the following reforms: Care Act, Assisted Living protections, Anti Predatory Lending, Paid Family Leave, and Affordable Housing.

In 2022, AARP and others brought a class action lawsuit against Alden Group, a healthcare provider based in Illinois. AARP said that Alden&#x27;s nursing facilities were intentionally understaffed, which led to neglect and unfair business practices.

AARP advocates locally against rising utility rates, for example, in Oklahoma, Colorado, Illinois, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Florida.

== Programs and offerings ==
AARP also provides several non-advocacy support programs for people older than 50. These include the following:

=== Virtual Community Center ===
AARP&#x27;s Virtual Community Center provides digital literacy courses, exercise classes, caregiving classes, and university lectures.

===AARP Driver Safety===
In 1979, AARP introduced the nation&#x27;s first driver safety course geared towards older adults. AARP Driver Safety, which can be completed in a classroom setting or online, teaches defensive driving techniques and provides &quot;added information on age-related cognitive and physical changes that affect driving&quot;. The course is instructed and promoted by volunteers throughout the U.S.

In addition to course fees, the program is supported by a grant from the automobile manufacturer, Toyota. Over a half million drivers completed the course in 2012 and over 15 million people completed the courses since 1979.

===AARP publications and broadcasts===
&quot;AARP The Magazine&quot;, with a circulation of approximately 37 million, and the &quot;AARP Bulletin&quot; with 30 million as of 2016, are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States.
&quot;AARP The Magazine&quot; (known until 2002 as &quot;Modern Maturity&quot;), is a lifestyle magazine for people 50+. Established in 1958, the magazine is distributed bi-monthly to AARP members. Other publications include &quot;The Journal&quot; and several newsletters. In 2018, the digital publication titled Sisters from AARP was launched, aimed at African American women.

The organization also produces radio programs and has a book division.

&quot;AARP en Español&quot; is AARP&#x27;s Spanish-language multimedia platform. Offerings include a Spanish-language website, a Spanish-language YouTube channel, and informational resources.

=== Awards ===

AARP&#x27;s &quot;Purpose Prize&quot; is awarded to people 50 and older who are making a social impact. The award was started in 2005 by CoGenerate and transferred to AARP in 2016.

The Movies for Grownups Awards &quot;recognizes achievements of those in the entertainment industry age 50 and over, and the films that speak to that vast audience&quot;, as well as supports the overall goals of the AARP. Past recipients include Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Jeff Bridges, Viola Davis, Morgan Freeman, Michael Douglas, and Lily Tomlin.

=== Innovation Labs ===
The AARP Innovation Labs works to identify products and services that can help the aging.

=== Finances and the economy ===

==== Tax Aide ====
AARP Foundation&#x27;s Tax Aide provides free tax assistance through trained and IRS-certified tax preparers. Tax Aide operates nationwide.

==== The Longevity Economy Outlook ====
&quot;The Longevity Economy Outlook: How people age 50 and older are fueling economic growth, stimulating jobs, and creating opportunities for all&quot; is a 2019 report jointly released by AARP and The Economist Intelligence Unit. The report focuses on the impact of the 50-plus population on the economy, and uses a forecasting model from REMI as well as spending, workforce, and tax contribution data. It also includes the estimated economic value of unpaid activities like volunteering and caregiving. This report updated a 2013 study.

In 2020, the Global Longevity Economy Outlook was published. It focused on how much older adults contributed to the global gross domestic product.

==== Telephone &quot;town halls&quot; ====
During the coronavirus pandemic, AARP hosted state and national telephone town halls to share information about the virus, vaccines, boosters, and other relevant topics such as mental and financial challenges for those aged fifty-plus, nursing homes, and voting procedures.

===Affiliates===
AARP has several affiliated organizations, including:
* AARP Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity that helps people over age 50 who are socioeconomically disadvantaged; it includes:
** AARP Experience Corps, a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity that encourages people over age 50 to mentor and tutor school children
** AARP Institute, a non-profit charity that holds some of AARP&#x27;s charitable gift annuity funds
* AARP Services, Inc., a for-profit corporation that provides quality control and research on new AARP products.
* Legal Counsel for the Elderly, a 501(c)(3) charity that provides legal aid to seniors in the Washington, D.C.
* AARP Financial Services Corporation, a for-profit corporation that holds AARP&#x27;s real estate.
* &quot;AARP Insurance Plan&quot;&#x27; is an organization that runs some of AARP&#x27;s group health insurance policies.

==Criticism==
In 2004, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; said questions have arisen in the past about whether AARP&#x27;s commercial interests may conflict with those of its membership, and characterizes many of the funds and insurance policies that AARP markets as providing considerably less benefit than seniors could get on their own.

In a November 2008 editorial, The Des Moines Register and the Canada Free Press called AARP a lobbying group masquerading as a non-profit, meanwhile charging high membership fees and selling expensive private health care plans.

Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in 2008 that the &quot;limited benefit&quot; insurance plans offered by AARP through UnitedHealth provided inadequate coverage and were marketed deceptively. One plan offered $5,000 for surgery that may cost two or three times that amount.

Criticism has been leveled at AARP staff&#x27;s salaries and the use of first-class and business-class travel for short trips. According to AARP&#x27;s 2014 IRS annual return, Chief Executive Officer Addison B. Rand received $1,698,289 of salary and benefits from AARP and its subsidiaries. Board members, officers, and key employees flew first class on flights longer than five hours unless business class was available. The Chief Executive Officer flew first-class on flights longer than 90 minutes. AARP reported that it had spent $8,694,890 on the compensation of its officers, directors, and key employees during 2014.

=== Senate investigation ===
In 1995, Senator Alan K. Simpson launched an investigation into AARP&#x27;s books, financial interests, and hiring practices. He described AARP as &quot;a vast empire that has figured out how to gimmick the nonprofit laws&quot; describing the organization as &quot;33 million people paying $8 dues, bound together by a common love of airline discounts and automobile discounts and pharmacy discounts,&quot; and that members &quot;haven&#x27;t the slightest idea what the organization is asking for.&quot;

The investigations did not reveal sufficient evidence to change the organization&#x27;s status.

=== Class action lawsuits ===
In 2018 and 2019, several class action lawsuits were filed against AARP regarding insurance policies. One lawsuit is over undisclosed licensing revenue that AARP earned from AARP-branded Medigap insurance policies. Another lawsuit claims that AARP acted as an insurance agent or an insurance broker, neither of which AARP is licensed to be, for AARP-branded Medigap insurance policies. In another lawsuit, the plaintiff said that AARP should not have used its status to claim the AARP-branded insurance policies were &quot;best for seniors&quot;.

All the lawsuits were dismissed.

<text>Laayoune or El Aaiún (, , , ) is the largest city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara, with a population of 271,344 in 2023. The city is &quot;de facto&quot; under Moroccan administration as occupied territory. The modern city is thought to have been founded by the Spanish captain Antonio de Oro in 1938. From 1958, it became the administrative capital of the Spanish Sahara, administered by the Governor General of Spanish West Africa.

In 2023, Laayoune is the capital of the Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra region administered by Morocco, it is still under the supervision of MINURSO, a UN mission.

The town is located south of the dry river of Saguia el-Hamra, where the old lower town constructed by Spanish colonists is located. The St. Francis of Assisi Cathedral was constructed during the Spanish period and is still active with a few Catholic missionaries.

==History==
&quot;Laayoune&quot; or &quot;El Aaiún&quot; are respectively the French and Spanish transliterations of one of the possible Romanized Maghrebi Arabic names for the city: &quot;Layoun&quot;, which could mean &quot;the springs&quot;, in reference to the oases that furnish the town&#x27;s water supply.

The city was founded by the Spanish captain Antonio de Oro in 1938 as a small military outpost, but quickly became the Spanish Sahara&#x27;s administrative and political centre. The location was chosen for two reasons: the presence of water and the strategic military position the site offered. Its position on the banks of the Saguia el-Hamra river enabled good communication with the harbors of Tarfaya and Boujdour. The city underwent a period of rapid economic growth in the 1940s due to the discovery of vast deposits of phosphates at the Bou Craa site fuelling a phosphate industry.

The town was the scene of the Zemla Intifada that occurred on June 17, 1970, that culminated in a massacre, resulting in the deaths ranging from 2 to 11 people and hundreds injured.

After the Spanish withdrew in 1975, Laayoune, along with much of the rest of the Western Sahara, was annexed by Morocco. Since then, large numbers of Moroccans have moved to the city, and now outnumber the indigenous Sahrawis, who have gradually given up their traditional nomadic lifestyles. 

The city has continued to develop rapidly and benefits of a desalinization plant. The city&#x27;s rate of urbanization continues to outpace that of Morocco, though on most indicators of human development, it lags behind southern Morocco.

==Climate==
Laayoune has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), moderated by the Canary Current, with an average annual temperature just over .
=== Climate change ===
A 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a &quot;moderate&quot; scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Laayoune in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Alexandria. The annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the warmest month by , while the temperature of the coldest month would decrease by . According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.

==Demographics==
Laayoune has a population of 271,344 and is the largest city in Western Sahara. 

==Economy and status==

The city is a hub for fishing and for phosphate mining in the region. In 2010, the country was negotiating a new fishing agreement with Europe over offshore fishing.

== Sport ==
The football club of the city is Jeunesse Massira. The club plays in the Moroccan Second Division, the second highest football league in the country. Jeunesse Massira uses Stade Sheikh Mohamed Laghdaf for training and games.

== Transport ==
Laayoune is served by the international Hassan I Airport.

== Education ==
French school associated to the Alliance française was established in 2018, the city also includes a Spanish international school, Colegio Español La Paz, owned by the Spanish government.

== Diplomatic missions ==
On 18 December 2019, Comoros became the first nation to open a consulate in support of Moroccan claims to the region. In January 2020, Gabon opened also a general consulate. Later on, São Tomé and Príncipe, the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Burundi, Eswatini, Zambia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain, also opened consulates in the city.

<text>Smara (also romanized Semara, , ; ) is a city in the Moroccan-controlled part of Western Sahara, with a population of 57,035 recorded in the 2014 Moroccan census. It is served by Smara Airport and Smara bus station.

==History==
The largest city in its province, Smara, was founded in the Saguia el-Hamra as an oasis for travellers in 1869. In the center of the city the remains of a stone fortress can be found, the Zawiy Maalainin, which enclosed a mosque. The Maalainin lived there from 1830 until 1912. It was made a capital and religious center in 1902 by shaykh Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn, in what was then Spanish Sahara. The location of the city was intended to ensure its becoming a caravan trade hub in the sparsely populated Sahara desert. The enlargement of Smara was carried out by local Sahrawis as well as craftsmen sent by the sultan Hassan I. In 1902, shaykh Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn moved to Smara and declared it his holy capital. Among other things, he created an important Islamic library, and the town became a center of religious learning.

In 1904 the shaykh declared himself an imam and called for holy war (jihad) against French colonialism, which was increasingly pressing into the Sahara at this time. During the campaign against Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn, Smara was sacked almost completely in 1913 by the French Army, and its library destroyed. The town was then handed over to the Spanish. In 1934 the town was once again destroyed after Sahrawi rebellions against the Spanish occupation.

===The Vieuchange brothers===
Reaching Ma el Ainain&#x27;s mysterious Smara was the goal of the brothers Vieuchange, early 20th-century French writers and romantics. Michel Vieuchange&#x27;s painful journey through the rebel-held Sahrawi lands in 1930 disguised as a Berber tribeswoman, eventually reaching Smara on 1 November 1930, and the dysentery that led to his death on the return, is documented in his journals. Comprising seven notebooks and more than 200 photographs, the account was published posthumously in 1932 as &quot;Smara: The Forbidden City&quot; (1932) by his brother Jean and became a bestseller.

===After 1975===
In 1975, Morocco took control of Saguia Elhamra as Spain withdrew, according to the Madrid Accords. The Moroccan army took the city from the Polisario Front in 1976. Near Tindouf, Algeria, there still exists a Sahrawi refugee camp named after Smara. It is one of the four camps of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic administration in Algeria.

The town is controlled by the Moroccan authorities, as part of what the government terms its Southern Provinces, and enclosed by a section of the Moroccan Wall.

<doc id="402080" wikidata="Q1280388" url="?curid=402080" title="Human T-lymphotropic virus 1">
<text>Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I), also called the adult T-cell lymphoma virus type 1, is a retrovirus of the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) family.

Most people with HTLV-1 infection do not appear to develop health conditions that can be directly linked to the infection. However, there is a subgroup of people who experience severe complications. The most well characterized are adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/Tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), both of which are only diagnosed in individuals testing positive to HTLV-1 infection. The estimated lifetime risk of ATL among people with HTLV-1 infection is approximately 5%, while that of HAM/TSP is approximately 2%.

In 1977, Adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) was first described in a case series of individuals from Japan. The symptoms of ATL were different from other lymphomas known at the time. The common birthplace shared amongst most of the ATL patients was suggestive of an infectious cause, referred to as ATLV. Strikingly, ATLV had the transforming activity in vitro. These studies established that HTLV-1 was the causitive agent of ATL. The retrovirus is now generally called HTLV-I because later studies proved that ATLV is the same as the firstly identified human retrovirus called HTLV discovered by Bernard Poiesz and Francis Ruscetti and their co-workers in the laboratory of Robert C. Gallo at the National Cancer Institute. Persistent lifelong infection is established when HTLV-1 integrates into the host genome as a provirus. A patient infected with HTLV-1 can be diagnosed when antibodies against HTLV-1 are detected in the serum.

==Virology==
HTLV-1 is a retrovirus belonging to the family retroviridae and the genus deltaretrovirus. It has a positive-sense RNA genome that is reverse transcribed into DNA and then integrated into the cellular DNA. Once integrated, HTLV-1 continues to exist only as a provirus which can spread from cell to cell through a viral synapse. Few, if any, free virions are produced and there is usually no detectable virus in the blood plasma though the virus is present in genital secretions. Like HIV, HTLV-1 predominantly infects CD4+ T cells.

The viral RNA is packed into the icosahedral capsid inside the proteinaceous inner envelope. The lipid outer envelope is of host cell origin but contains viral transmembrane and surface proteins. The virion is spherical with a diameter of about 100 nm.

HTLV-1 is genetically classified into seven subtypes, each defined by a unique geographic distribution influenced by population migration. The most globally widespread is the cosmopolitan subtype A, which further branches into several subgroups: transcontinental, Japanese, West African, North African, Senegalese, and Afro-Peruvian. While subtypes B, D, E, F, and G are localized to distinct regions in Africa, subtype C is predominant in Australia and Oceania.

HTLV-1 is believed to have originated from the simian T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV-1), a retrovirus prevalent among numerous nonhuman primates in intertropical Africa. This theory is supported by the significant genetic diversity of HTLV-1 subtypes in Africa, potentially arising from repeated zoonotic transmissions during human interactions with STLV-1 endemic nonhuman primates. This correlation is further reinforced by the observation that individuals bitten by nonhuman primates exhibit HTLV-1 strains with sequences remarkably homologous to the STLV-1 found in local primate species.

==Epidemiology==
The global distribution of HTLV-I is highly heterogeneous, with focal occurrence in diverse regions. Within areas where HTLV-I is found, its occurrence varies considerably, with endemic clusters often situated near populations with lower prevalence. This pattern might be influenced by the founder effect, suggesting prolonged viral transmission within isolated groups, but this theory warrants further investigation. Consistent findings reveal that HTLV-1 prevalence increases with age and is usually higher in adult females than males. Areas broadly regarded as having endemic regions include Japan, Iran, the Americas, the Caribbean, Melanesia, Central and West Africa, and Australia. Globally, there remains a lack of robust data from populous countries like India and Nigeria and most of North and East Africa. As such, current global prevalence estimates, which are based on known endemic regions, likely underestimate the true global prevalence.

In Australia, HTLV-I has a notably high prevalence among Aboriginal communities in Central Australia. Community-based cross-sectional studies from Central Australia report HTLV-1 prevalences exceeding 30%, representing the highest reported prevalence for any population worldwide. In Taiwan, in Iran, and in Fujian (a Chinese province near Taiwan) the prevalence is 0.1–1%. The infection rate is about 1% in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, where genotype C predominates. In Europe HTLV-1 is uncommon, although it is present in some populations, generally people who have migrated from known endemic regions. In the Americas, HTLV-1 is found in some Indigenous populations and descendants of African ancestry from where it is thought to have originated. Prevalence ranges from 0.1 to 1%. In Africa, the prevalence is not well known, but it is about 1% in some countries.

HTLV-I infection in the United States appears to be about half as prevalent among IV drug users and about one-tenth as prevalent in the population at large as HIV infection. Although little serologic data exist, the prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among blacks living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among black intravenous drug users in New Jersey, and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in New Orleans.

It is also high among the Inuit of Northern Canada, in Japan, northeastern Iran, Peru, the Pacific coast of Colombia and Ecuador, and the Caribbean.

==Transmission==
HTLV-1 has three main routes of transmission. Vertical transmission is most common, through which an infected mother transmits the virus to her child. The risk to a fetus while inside the womb is minimal, given the virtual absence of viral particles in human plasma. Most vertical infection occurs through breastfeeding. About 25% of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers are infected, while less than 5% of children born to but not breastfed by infected mothers are infected. Sexual transmission is the second-most common, whereby an individual infects another through an exchange of bodily fluids. Some evidence has suggested that male-to-female transmission is more efficient than female-to-male transmission. For example, one study in Japan found a 61% transmission rate for males to females vs. a less than 1% rate for females to males. The least common is parenteral transmission through blood transfusion, with an infection rate of 44-63% estimated in one study, and needle sharing among intravenous drug users. With proper prophylaxis (e.g. breastfeeding counseling for mothers, condom use, and donor blood screening), rates of transmission can be effectively reduced. The importance of the various routes of transmission is believed to vary geographically. The research in discordant couples showed that the probability of sexual transmission is about 0.9 per 100 person-years.
* In Japan, the geographic clustering of infections suggests that the virus is more dependent on mother-to-child transmission.
* In the Caribbean, the geographic distribution of the virus is more uniform, and it is more common among those with many sexual partners, indicating that sexual transmission is more common.

==Tropism==

The term viral tropism refers to which cell types HTLV-I can infect. Although HTLV-1 is primarily found in CD4+ T cells, other cell types in the peripheral blood of infected individuals have been found to contain HTLV-1, including CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells. HTLV-I entry is mediated through the interaction of the surface unit of the virion envelope glycoprotein (SU) with its cellular receptor GLUT1, a glucose transporter, on target cells.

==Associated diseases==

===Malignancies===

====Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma====

HTLV-1 is also associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and has been quite well studied in Japan. The time between infection and onset of cancer also varies geographically. It is believed to be about sixty years in Japan and less than forty years in the Caribbean. The cancer is thought to be due to the pro-oncogenic effect of viral RNA incorporated into host lymphocyte DNA. Chronic stimulation of the lymphocytes at the cytokine level may play a role in the development of the malignancy. The lymphoma ranges from a very indolent and slowly progressive type to a very aggressive and nearly uniformly lethal proliferative type.

====Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma====
There is some evidence that HTLV-1 is a causative agent of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

===Inflammatory diseases===

====HTLV myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis====

HTLV-1 is also associated with a progressive demyelinating upper motor neuron disease known as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), characterized by sensory and motor deficits, particularly of the lower extremities, incontinence and impotence. Only 0.3 to 4% of infected individuals develop HAM/TSP, but this will vary from one geographic location to another.

Signs and symptoms of HTLV myelopathy include:
* Motor and sensory changes in the extremities
* Spastic gait in combination with weakness of the lower limbs
* Clonus
* Bladder dysfunction (neurogenic bladder) and bladder cancer
Other neurologic findings that may be found in HTLV include:
* Mild cognitive impairment
* Erectile dysfunction

====Arthropathy====
HTLV-1 is associated with a rheumatoid-like arthropathy, although the evidence is contradictory. In these cases, patients have a negative rheumatoid factor.

====Uveitis====
Studies from Japan demonstrated that HTLV-1 infection may be associated with an intermediate uveitis. At onset the patients present with blurred vision and floaters. The prognosis is favorable—the condition usually resolves within weeks.

===Opportunistic infections===
Individuals infected with HTLV-1 are at risk for opportunistic infections—diseases not caused by the virus itself but by alterations in the host&#x27;s immune functions.

HTLV-1, unlike the distantly related retrovirus HIV, has an immunostimulating effect which becomes immunosuppressive. The virus activates a subset of T-helper cells called Th1 cells. The result is a proliferation of Th1 cells and overproduction of Th1-related cytokines (mainly IFN-γ and TNF-α). Feedback mechanisms of these cytokines cause a suppression of the Th2 lymphocytes and a reduction of Th2 cytokine production (mainly IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13). The result is a reduction in the ability of the infected host to mount an adequate immune response to invading organisms that require a predominantly Th2-dependent response (these include parasitic infections and the production of mucosal and humoral antibodies).

In the central Australian Aboriginal population, HTLV-1 is thought to be related to their extremely high rate of death from sepsis. It is also particularly associated with bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition predisposing to recurrent pneumonia. It is also associated with chronic infected dermatitis, often superinfected with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and a severe form of &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot; infection called hyper-infestation which may lead to death from polymicrobial sepsis. HTLV-1 infection has also been associated with Tuberculosis.

==Treatment==

Treatment of opportunistic infections varies depending on the type of disease and ranges from careful observation to aggressive chemotherapy and antiretroviral agents. Adult T cell lymphoma is a common complication of HTLV infection and requires aggressive chemotherapy, typically R-CHOP. Other treatments for ATL in HTLV-infected patients include interferon alpha, zidovudine with interferon alpha and CHOP with arsenic trioxide. Treatments for HTLV myelopathy are even more limited and focus mainly on symptomatic therapy. Therapies studied include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and interferon, which may produce a temporary symptomatic improvement in myelopathy symptoms.

Valproic acid has been studied to determine if it might slow the progression of HTLV disease by reducing viral load. Although in one human study, it was effective in reducing viral load, there did not appear to be a clinical benefit. Recently, however, a study of valproic acid combined with zidovudine showed a major decrease in the viral load of baboons infected with HTLV-1. It is important to monitor HTLV patients for opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus, histoplasmosis, scabies, pneumocystis pneumonia, and staphylococcal infections. HIV testing should also be performed, as some patients may be co-infected with both viruses.

Allogenic bone marrow transplantation has been investigated to treat HTLV-1 disease with varied results. One case report describes an HTLV-1-infected woman who developed chronic refractory eczema, corneal injury, and adult T-cell leukemia. She was subsequently treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation and had complete resolution of symptoms. One year post-transplant, she has had no recurrence of any symptoms, and furthermore has had a decrease in her proviral load.

<doc id="402082" wikidata="Q345204" url="?curid=402082" title="Dakhla, Western Sahara">
<text>Dakhla (, ; formerly known as Villa Cisneros) is a city in the disputed territory of Western Sahara, currently occupied by Morocco. It is the capital of the claimed Moroccan administrative region Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab. It has a population of 106,277 and is on a narrow peninsula of the Atlantic Coast, the Río de Oro Peninsula, about south of Laayoune.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Rio de Oro was settled in the twelfth century by the Oulad Delim, an Arab Bedouin tribe of South Arabian descent that emigrated from Yemen. Dakhla was expanded by Spanish settlers during the expansion of their empire. The Spanish interest in the desert coast of Western Africa&#x27;s Sahara arose as the result of fishing carried out from the nearby Canary Islands by Spanish fishers and as a result of the Barbary pirates menace.

Spanish fishers were seal fur hunters, traders, and whalers along the Saharan coast from Dakhla to Cabo Blanco from 1500 to the present, engaging in whaling for Humpback whales and their calves, mostly around Cape Verde, and the Gulf of Guinea in Annobón, São Tomé and Príncipe islands through 1940. These fishing activities had a negative impact on wildlife, causing the disappearance or endangering of many species, particularly marine mammals and birds.

=== Spanish colonization ===
The Spaniards established whaling stations with some cod fishing and trading. In 1881, a dock was anchored off the coast of the Río de Oro Peninsula to support the work of the Canarian fishing fleet. However, it was not until 1884 that Spain formally founded the watering place as Villa Cisneros, in the settlement dated in 1502 by Papal bull. It was included in the enclaves conceded to the Spanish to the east of the Azores islands. Upon arriving in Rio de Oro in 1884 to establish their first coastal factories, the Spanish were forced to deal with the Oulad Delim, a Sahrawi Arab tribe that controlled the entirety of Rio de Oro and a strip of land in Mauritania extending from Nouadhibou to Idjlil. In 1884, the settlement of Villa Cisneros was promoted by the Spanish Society of Africanists and funded by the government of Canovas del Castillo. In the same year, the Oulad Delim attacked the trading post and looted its stores before the Spanish issued a royal decree that placed the coast from Cape Bojador to Cape Blanc under Spanish colonization. By 1886, Spanish colonial authority was extended 150 miles inland. The Spanish reached an agreement with a sheikh of the local Oulad Delim two years later.
The Spanish military, along with the Spanish Africanist Emilio Bonelli, claimed the coast between Cape Bojador and Cabo Blanco for Spain, founding three settlements on the Saharan coast: one in Villa Cisneros, named in honour of Francisco Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros (1436–1517), the Spanish prelate who was the Grand Inquisitor during the Spanish Inquisition; and another in Cabo Blanco for seal hunting, which was given the name of Medina Gatell; and another in Angra de Cintra with the name of Puerto Badia, in honour of the Arabist and adventurer Domingo Badia. Bonelli got the native inhabitants of the peninsula de Río de Oro to sign an agreement that placed them under the &quot;protection&quot; of the Kingdom of Spain. Due to the presence of the three new settlements, in December 1884 the Spanish Government officially informed the main colonial powers assembled at the Berlin Conference that the Spanish Crown was in possession of the territory lying between Cape Bojador and Cape Blanco.

During the colonial period, Spanish authorities made Dakhla, then known as Villa Cisneros, the capital of the province of Río de Oro, one of the two regions of what was known as Spanish Sahara. The authorities built a military fortress and it became an important way-station for the Toulouse-Dakar mail-plane during the 1920s. The Cisneros way-station features in Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s novel Courier Sud. The Spanish also built a modern Catholic church there. A prison camp existed at the fort during the Spanish Civil War at which writers such as Pedro García Cabrera were imprisoned.

During the 1960s, the Francoist State also built Dakhla Airport, one of the three paved airports in Western Sahara. 

It was from Dakhla that on 12 January 1976, General Gomez de Salazar became the last Spanish soldier to depart what until that moment had been the colony of the Spanish Sahara; faced with Moroccan and Mauritanian pressure, Spanish authorities decided to give up the territory peacefully, instead of undertaking a fight that they believed they could win but would have cost many lives on all sides. Between 1975 and 1979, Dakhla was the provincial capital of the Mauritanian province of Tiris al-Gharbiyya, as Mauritania annexed the southern portion of Western Sahara. Dakhla Airport is used as a civilian airport and by Royal Air Maroc. The 3000 m runway can accommodate a Boeing 737 or smaller aircraft. The passenger terminal covers 670 m2 and is capable of handling up to 55,000 passengers per year.

=== Moroccan occupation ===
Dakhla was occupied by Spain from the late 19th century to 1975, when power was then relinquished to a joint administration between Morocco and Mauritania. There was a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire in 1991, but as recently as 2006, most UN member states have refused to recognise Moroccan sovereignty in the area.

In 2020, The Gambia, Guinea, Djibouti, Liberia, Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo opened consulates in Dakhla.

As of 2024, the government of Morocco was in the process of building a $1.2-billion port in Dakhla as part of its &quot;national port strategy&quot;. Construction was expected to be completed in 2028.

== Economy==
=== Tourism and sports ===
Dakhla&#x27;s main economic activity is fishing and tourism. In recent years the town has become a centre for aquatic sports, such as kitesurfing, windsurfing and surf casting, and is known as a centre for water sports. The natural hot spring of Asmaa, located 36 km from the city of Dakhla, is also a very popular spot for tourists who come for its 38 °C thermal waters, sourced from a well about 700 meters deep.

Golfo de Cintra and the Mauritanian Banc d&#x27;Arguin National Park are located in the south.

=== Oil ===
A United States firm Kosmos Energy and its United Kingdom counterpart Cairn Energy began searching for oil in Western Sahara in early 2015.

=== Oyster industry ===
Oyster farming by hand is a traditional practice in Dakhla. Oysters are first sold to people and businesses in Dakhla, then to restaurants in cities like Marrakesh or Casablanca, and then any left are sold to Europe. In April 2015, Vice Media reported that oysters had recently begun to be exported to high-end European restaurants.

== Climate ==
Dakhla has a mild desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. Dakhla receives an average of precipitation per year. The temperature averages around during January, Dakhla&#x27;s coldest month and around during September, its warmest month. The temperature seems to be moderated by the Canary Current.

== Nature and ecology ==

Like most areas in Western Sahara, Dakhla and vicinity areas are very poor in vegetation and are mostly covered by the Sahara Desert. Unlike on land however, sea waters are or had been very rich in sea life due to the highly productive Current System of Canary flowing offshore and the renown Nouadhibou upwelling which is located nearby as well. These environmental factors provide excellent conditions for local fisheries, and result in strong local biodiversity for birds in particular. For these reasons, there has been a UNESCO proposal to create the &quot;Dakhla National Park&quot;.

=== Birds ===
Dakhla Peninsula and Cintra Bay are some of the most important wintering grounds for birds especially for waders. The greater flamingo is one of the most iconic birds in the region and there are numerous others known to migrate or inhabit. Some of these are; pelican, great cormorant, gulls (slender-billed, Audouin&#x27;s, black-backed), larks (sparrow, bar-tailed), terns (little, Caspian, royal, Sandwich), black wheatear, western reef heron, marsh harrier, sparrowhawk, lesser kestrel, laughing dove, great spotted cuckoo, little swift, hoopoe, rock martin, cricket longtail, oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, pharaoh eagle owl, and red-knobbed coot.

Bald ibis and buttonquail are also rare on today&#x27;s Western Sahara.

Several species such as golden nightjar, Sudan golden sparrow, hooded vulture, dark chanting goshawk, speckled pigeon, African mourning dove, blue-naped mousebird, Kordofan lark, red-chested swallow, chestnut-bellied starling, African swallow-tailed kite, tawny eagle, slender-billed curlew, demoiselle crane, Arabian bustard, ostrich, lappet-faced vulture, helmeted guineafowl are seemingly locally rare or extinct, or rather visitors of vagrants.

=== Mammals ===
Terrestrial animals are less diverse than birds, including Ruppell&#x27;s fox, fennec fox, caracal, hyena, camel, gazelles, addaxes, hares, hedgehog variants, fat sand rat, lesser Egyptian jerboa, bats, and others. Barbary lion and hartebeest became extinct, and possibly local cheetah and North African elephant as well.

The calm, sheltered water of the Dakhla Bay was once an ideal habitat for various forms of marine life, including marine mammals. Most of the local animals such as Mediterranean monk seals and whales (mostly North Atlantic right whales) have disappeared due to histories of slaughter and exploitation like in Cintra Bay. Atlantic gray whales were likely to be seen along the coast before extinction.

On the other hand, monk seals are showing slow but certain recoveries and Ras Nouadhibou holds the world&#x27;s most notable colony for this species. Nowadays, very small, remnant groups of bottlenose dolphins and Atlantic humpback dolphins are the only marine mammals still seen regularly in Dakhla Bay while there are occasional visits by some other species including orcas while cetaceans like minke, or sei, pilot whales, beaked whales, and dolphins are more common in offshore waters in today&#x27;s Western Sahara.

=== Reptiles and others ===
Other than mammals, limited varieties of terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, arthropods are present here including lizards, smooth snake, Brongersma&#x27;s toad, and yellow-tailed scorpion. Sea turtles are also present in the Dakhla region.

Larger fish like groupers, seabasses or croakers inhabit along the coasts. Dakhla and Cintra Bay areas are considered to be spawning grounds for local sardines.

<text>Edmund Casimir Szoka (September 14, 1927 – August 20, 2014) was an American Catholic prelate who served as president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and President of the Governorate of Vatican City State from 1997 to 2006. He previously served as Bishop of Gaylord from 1971 to 1981 and Archbishop of Detroit from 1981 to 1990. Szoka was elevated to the cardinalate in 1988.

==Early life==
Edmund Casimir Szoka was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Casimir and Mary (née Wolgat) Szoka, Polish immigrants. He has an older sister, Irene, and moved with his family in the early 1930s to Muskegon, where he did his primary studies at St. Michael School. Attracted to life as a priest at an early age, Szoka attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Grand Rapids, 
Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit for his junior and senior years, and then St. John&#x27;s Provincial Seminary in Plymouth, Michigan to study theology.

==Priesthood==
On June 5, 1954, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Noa in St. Peter&#x27;s Cathedral in Marquette, Michigan. He did pastoral work in Manistique. From 1957 to 1959, he studied canon law at the Pontifical Urbaniana University or the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. He then became secretary to Bishop Noa of Marquette, whom he accompanied to the first session of the Second Vatican Council in 1962. During this period he also served as chaplain at St. Mary’s Hospital and K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. Upon returning to the United States, Szoka did pastoral and curial work, including serving as an official of the matrimonial tribunal in Marquette until 1971. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness on November 14, 1963, by Pope Paul VI.

==Episcopal ministry==
===Bishop of Gaylord===
Szoka was appointed the first Bishop of Gaylord on June 11, 1971. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 20 from Cardinal John Francis Dearden, with Bishops Charles Salatka and Joseph McKinney serving as co-consecrators. A year later, the Bishops of the 4th pastoral region of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) elected him president for the period of 1972-77. At the same time, he was treasurer and secretary of the Episcopal Conference of Michigan. As Bishop of Gaylord, Szoka improved the annulment consideration process, drawing from his experience in the matrimonial tribunal in Marquette.

===Archbishop of Detroit===
On March 21, 1981, he was promoted to be third Metropolitan Archbishop of Detroit (eighth bishop) by Pope John Paul II.
After 1981, he also served as president of the Administration Council for the provincial seminary of St. John in Plymouth, Michigan, and of SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary near Orchard Lake Village, Michigan. He was also a president of the board of directors of the Episcopal Conference of Michigan, member of the executive committee of The Catholic University of America, president of the Committee for University Relations, Administrator of the National Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception, treasurer of the NCCB, and served on committees within the Conference for: human values, bishops, dioceses and provinces, and economic affairs. He faced challenges of finance and enforcing Church discipline, and welcomed John Paul II to Detroit in 1987 during his tenure as Archbishop.

In 1983, he dealt with the case of Agnes Mary Mansour, a nun and the director of the Michigan Department of Community Health who worked to continue abortion services in Michigan. Szoka had given his permission for Mansour to serve the state but said she must oppose publicly funded abortion. Mansour believed abortion was tragic but should be legal, and she continued disbursing Medicaid abortion funds. Szoka appealed to Mansour&#x27;s superiors in the Sisters of Mercy but the order supported her stance. Szoka referred the case to the Vatican, and Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua resolved it by ordering Mansour to resign either her government post or her orders. Mansour left the sisterhood.

He was created Cardinal-Priest of &quot;Ss. Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio&quot; by John Paul II in the consistory of June 28, 1988.

Rev. Joseph Gembela, pastor of St. Malachy&#x27;s parish, noted that Szoka received a good deal of unjust criticism when he closed thirty churches in Detroit during 1989-90; many of which were sparsely attended. The first large-scale closing of Catholic churches in a major U.S. city, other dioceses with changing demographics have since followed suit.

==Roman Curia==
Resigning as Archbishop of Detroit on April 28, 1990, Szoka had been named President of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See on January 22, 1990, and served as such to October 14, 1997. In this position, he helped manage the Vatican&#x27;s financial affairs.

On October 14, 1997, Cardinal Szoka was named President of the Governorate of Vatican City State, and on February 22, 2001, President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Within the Roman Curia his membership included: Secretariat of State (second section), and Causes of Saints, Bishops, Evangelization of Peoples (&quot;Congregatio de Propaganda Fide&quot;), Clergy, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (congregations). He submitted his resignation to John Paul II in 2002, at the Church&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 75, but was requested to continue working. During his rare spare time, Szoka enjoyed walking through the Vatican Gardens.

Szoka was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. As Governor of the Vatican, it fell to Szoka, along with Secretary of State Angelo Sodano and Camerlengo Eduardo Martínez Somalo, to prepare for the cardinal electors&#x27; housing at the &quot;Domus Sanctae Marthae&quot;.

==Retirement==
It was announced on June 22, 2006, that his resignation had been accepted by Pope Benedict and that he would officially step down on September 15, 2006; he maintained all curial memberships until age 80. On what he would do after retirement, Szoka said he was interested in travel, writing, studying the Church Fathers, and continuing to provide priestly assistance to Detroit.
Cardinal Szoka had fond memories of Pope John Paul II, especially in regard to his travels to Poland and to the United States: Cardinal Szoka lived in Northville, Michigan.

Szoka died on August 20, 2014, of natural causes, at Providence Park Hospital in Novi, Michigan.

<doc id="402085" wikidata="Q2837861" url="?curid=402085" title="Belcourt of Newport">
<text>Belcourt is a former summer cottage designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt for Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont and located on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. Construction was begun in 1891 and completed in 1894, and it was intended to be used for only six to eight weeks of the year. Belcourt was designed in a multitude of European styles and periods; it features a heavy emphasis on French Renaissance and Gothic decor, with further borrowings from German, English, and Italian design. In the Gilded Age, the castle was noted for its extensive stables and carriage areas, which were incorporated into the main structure.

==Construction==

Belcourt is located on Bellevue Avenue at Lakeview Avenue, in Newport. A 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2), 60-room summer villa, it was designed by Richard Morris Hunt for 33-year-old Oliver Belmont, who during the construction was divorced from Sara Swan Whiting and the father of a daughter, Natica, for whom he denied paternity. It was based on the Louis XIII hunting lodge at Versailles, and incorporated Oliver&#x27;s love of pageantry, history and horses in its magnificent interior halls, salons and ballrooms. The Belmont Stakes was named for his father, August Belmont Sr., and Oliver was known for his skill as a four-in-hand carriage driver. Belmont wanted Belcourt designed precisely to his specifications. Hunt was hesitant, but concentrated on his guiding principle that it was his client&#x27;s money he was spending. Construction cost $3.2 million in 1894, a figure of approximately $80 million in 2011 dollars. Belmont employed some thirty servants at Belcourt, with aggregate wages of approximately $100 per week, or approximately 40% of the national average wage at the time.

==Belmont years==
When construction finished in 1894, the entire first floor was composed of carriage space and a multitude of stables for Belmont&#x27;s prized horses. Upstairs was a master bedroom with wall scenes depicting the life of a nobleman and a bathroom with Newport&#x27;s first standing shower.
Scheduled to open for July 4 of that year, Belcourt would remain closed for the summer season while Belmont was hospitalized in New York City, the victim of a mugging. It would be a full year until Belmont saw his completed mansion.

The building was formed of a large quadrangle, with two-story wings connecting to a three-story main block (the north wing). The effect can be viewed today in the form of a large, 80-by-40-foot (24-by-12m) central courtyard with half timbers in the Norman style. The immense mansard roof is pierced by oval copper dormers and chimneys finished in the same manner as the walls. The symmetrical north façade is where the carriage entrances were located. A narrow wrought-iron balcony stretches 70 feet (20 m) on the second floor.

Belmont had disdain for the nouveau riche who, in splashy displays of wealth, built ostentatious mansions between Bellevue Avenue and the Atlantic coast. As a result, guests entered Belcourt through an entrance just off of Ledge Road, a short road that runs parallel to Bellevue Avenue.

Inside the castle was just as magnificent and somewhat eccentric. Belmont housed his vast collection of horses and carriages on the ground floor, accessed by two huge carriage entrances on either side of the north façade. To the west of this vast area was Belmont&#x27;s Francis I Renaissance-style Grand Hall and foyer, which exited onto Ledge Road. The monumental Gothic rooms with their huge stained-glass windows were emblazoned with the Belmont coat of arms. The room&#x27;s original damask, blood red in color, has long since been replaced with the same fabric in gold.

The Grand Staircase, now a replica of the stairs in the Cluny Museum in France, connects the Lower Grand Hall to Belmont&#x27;s Upper Grand Hall on the second floor. The details are mostly the same as those of its partner room below. Myriad formal rooms open onto one another in varying periods of French style and decoration. The galleries and halls of the second floor employ the architect&#x27;s trademark of vistas framing the views into various rooms.

Belmont married his neighbor Alva Vanderbilt, the former wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt, on January 11, 1896. Eager to reshape and redesign Belcourt, Alva made changes that morphed the already eccentric character of Belcourt into a yet more eccentric hybrid mixture of styles. Alva Belmont converted the carriage room into a banquet hall and transformed a study into a boudoir, importing 18th-century French paneling. In 1899, Belcourt was the host of the nation&#x27;s first automobile parade.

==Changes in ownership==
Oliver Belmont died in 1908 and Mrs. Belmont died in France on January 26, 1933. Belcourt passed to 80-year-old Perry Belmont, the eldest Belmont child and Alva&#x27;s brother-in-law. At the onset of World War II, Perry Belmont had most of the contents of Belcourt moved to his other estates as Newport was a naval base and potentially at risk of attack. Select pieces of Alva&#x27;s were auctioned off, as Perry allegedly had no great love for her.

In 1940, Belmont decided to rid himself of Belcourt. Negotiations commenced with George Waterman, an entrepreneur. Waterman envisioned Belcourt as an antique auto museum. The only conditions of the sale were that Waterman had to restore the castle as close as possible to Hunt&#x27;s original plans. Waterman was responsible for the restoration of the third-floor roof and removal of an addition overlooking the courtyard. After paying $1,000 for the castle, Waterman was informed that zoning wouldn&#x27;t allow his antique auto museum.

In 1943, Waterman sold Belcourt to Edward Dunn, who never lived at Belcourt during the eleven years that he owned it (up until 1954). During the war years when many of the grand mansions were being razed or converted into various institutions, Dunn rented the stables of the rundown castle to the military to use for repairing equipment.

Dunn sold Belcourt to Louis and Elaine Lorillard in 1954 for $22,500. The Lorillards, of tobacco fame, envisioned Belcourt as a seat for the Newport Jazz Festival. The lawns on Bellevue Avenue could accommodate over 10,000 and the masonry and stucco façade provided an acoustic background. The large central courtyard was the scene for concerts, with the open loggia providing further room for spectators. Inside, the massive rooms were used for workshops and lodging. However, the future for Belcourt as a permanent venue for the festival was dim due to protests from the neighbors.

Belcourt had deteriorated, largely uninhabited for over two decades. In November 1956, the Lorillards sold the rundown, mostly abandoned castle to the Tinney Family.

===The Tinneys===

The Tinney Family, of Cumberland, Rhode Island, bought Belcourt in 1956 for $25,000. In addition to changing the name from Belcourt to Belcourt Castle, the Tinneys filled the castle with their own collection of antiques and reproductions. Included are a coronation coach, which son Donald made, and a 1701 copy of a Hyacinthe Rigaud portrait of Louis XIV, which hung in the Green Room in the Palace of the Tuileries. The centerpiece of the Tinney additions was an enormous Imperial Russian-style chandelier, which holds 13,000 rock crystal prisms and 105 lights. The chandelier hangs a few feet above the rose marble mosaic floor of the banquet hall.

At the time that Belcourt was purchased in 1956, the Tinney family comprised Harold Tinney, his wife Ruth Tinney, their son Donald Tinney, and Ruth&#x27;s aunt Nellie Fuller (a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Edward Fuller). In 1960, Donald Tinney married Harle Hanson, who had been at Belcourt to work as a tour guide. Harle Tinney was the only surviving member of the family when Belcourt was sold in 2012.

Other artifacts within Belcourt included an immense collection of Persian rugs, French royal art and furnishings, Oriental art and furnishings, and numerous religious objets d&#x27;art.

Changes at Belcourt have been numerous in the years following 1956, when the Tinney family moved in. They raised the ceiling of the Organ Loft 11 feet (3.4 m) to accommodate a 26-rank tracker organ. Between 1966 and 1970, when the coronation coach was being built, an old kitchen area became a coach hall. In 1969, the open loggia became a French salon. In 1975, they transformed the north-west reception room into a chapel with the addition of German Renaissance stained glass. In the early 1980s, the Tinneys built gate piers on Bellevue Avenue and installed gates that they had acquired from the Taylor estate in Portsmouth. The overthrow was altered to make the gates the tallest of any estate entrance in Newport.

In 1983, robbers attempted a million-dollar heist of Belcourt&#x27;s antiques. Police recovered many artifacts but not a 14-pound silver reliquary containing a relic from the third century.

The lawns contain many sculptural pieces in bronze, terra cotta, marble and stone. Depicting scenes from mythology, nymphs and cherubs, the collection is an informal contrast to the strong and robust lines of the French-style château. The driveways and pathways are lined with lush arborvitae, planted by the Tinneys a few years after they moved into Belcourt.

Belcourt is the third largest mansion in Newport, after The Breakers and Ochre Court. The castle has been the subject of an ongoing restoration project spanning from the beginning of the Tinney family&#x27;s occupation of the castle up to and including the present day.

On May 26, 2009, it was reported that the then-owner of Belcourt, Harle Tinney, had put the residence up for sale. The home was put on the market for $7.2 million. As of June 2011, the price had been reduced twice to $5.1 million and then to $3.9 million. Subsequently, it was taken off of the market and re-listed for sale in two parcels totaling $4.625 million. Tinney said she was ready to part with the home after her husband&#x27;s death in 2006.

====Belcourt as a museum====

Belcourt was open to the public as a museum of antiquities and architectural and social history. Of the 60 rooms at Belcourt, over a dozen were viewable on tour. A visit to the castle included viewings of an English library (added in 1910 by John Russell Pope; the ceiling is a replica of the one in Haddon Hall&#x27;s Long Gallery), a banquet hall, a chapel, two of three grand halls, a music room, an Empire-style dining room, a French gothic-style ballroom, two principal bedrooms, a loggia and a gallery. All of the rooms are furnished with pieces from the Tinney family collections. The first tours of Belcourt were given in 1957 and, ever since then, the castle has been a fixture on Bellevue Avenue. The collections included furnishings, art and artifacts from 33 European and Asian countries and 37 other Newport mansions. The Tinney family&#x27;s enormous collection earned Belcourt a notable status within Newport&#x27;s thriving tourism industry. Belcourt was also the only mansion in Newport that was both open to the public and had a private owner in residence. Harle Tinney frequently guided tours through her home and was often present to greet visitors when she was in residence.

===Rafaeilian===
On November 12, 2012, Belcourt was purchased by Carolyn Rafaelian, owner of the Cranston, Rhode Island–based company Alex and Ani, for $3.6 million. Rafaelian is currently restoring and renovating the mansion, which she reopened in summer 2014 as a tour house, art gallery, and event space under the business name Belcourt of Newport. Rafaelian reports she has already spent $5 million on renovations, including $3 million for a new roof.

Belcourt&#x27;s distinctive exterior appearance was achieved through the use of brick and Westerly granite to frame the windows, doors and fields of stucco. The roof is sheathed in Pennsylvania slate and is pierced by numerous ox-eye (elliptical) dormer windows. The interior, completed by 300 imported artisans, was created of carved oak with oak and mosaic marble floors. The numerous decorative ceilings were finished with sculpted and molded plaster and carved woods such as chestnut. The walls are finished with canvas paintings, carved oak, imported paneling and pure silk damasks. The numerous exterior railings and gates are composed of wrought iron and bronze, featuring a shell motif and the monogram &quot;OB.&quot; The foundations are stone, brick and poured concrete with thick brick walls supporting enormous roof timbers and steel I-beams.

<doc id="402086" wikidata="Q264290" url="?curid=402086" title="Mizuho Fukushima">
<text>is a Japanese politician and attorney. A native of Nobeoka, Miyazaki, she has been a member of the House of Councillors since 1998, was re-elected in 2004 and 2010,
and was the head of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDP), from 2003 to 2013. She was elected as the leader of the party for a second time in February 2020.

==Education and career before politics==

After graduating from the University of Tokyo with a Bachelor of Laws degree, she became a lawyer in 1987. She was a Visiting Professor at Gakushuin Women&#x27;s College.

==Political career and political views==

Fukushima was also Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety, Social Affairs, and Gender Equality in Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama&#x27;s cabinet (16 September 2009 – 28 May 2010); the SDP was the junior partner in the DPJ-led government coalition. However, in May 2010 disagreements over the issue of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on 28 May and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition.

Fukushima&#x27;s Social Democratic Party has an anti-nuclear platform, and she has been referred to as a prominent anti-nuclear activist. For three decades, she was at the forefront of an often futile fight against the utilities that operated Japan&#x27;s nuclear reactors, the corporations that built them and the bureaucrats who enabled them. That situation changed with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011.

She has stated her opposition to capital punishment on the SDP&#x27;s website.

After a disappointing result in the 2013 election for the House of Councillors she announced her resignation as head of the party.

Fukushima was elected as the leader of the Social Democratic Party on 22 February 2020.

Fukushima was a recipient of the Knights of the Ordre national du Mérite in December 2020.

<doc id="402087" wikidata="Q2337340" url="?curid=402087" title="Cenepa War">
<text>The Cenepa War or Third Ecuadorian-Peruvian War (26 January – 28 February 1995), also known as the Alto Cenepa War, was a brief and localized military conflict between Ecuador and Peru, fought over control of an area in Peruvian territory (i.e. in the eastern side of the Cordillera del Cóndor, Province of Condorcanqui, Región Amazonas, Republic of Perú) near the border between the two countries. The two nations had signed a border treaty following the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941, but Ecuador later disagreed with the treaty as it applied to the Cenepa and Paquisha areas, and in 1960 it declared the treaty null and void. Most of the fighting took place around the headwaters of the Cenepa River.

Mediation efforts of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States paved the way for the opening of diplomatic conversations that ultimately led to the signing of a definitive peace agreement (the Brasilia Presidential Act) on 26 October 1998. The peace agreement saw some of the territory being leased to Ecuador for a time. It was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multinational MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999, which effectively put an end to one of the longest territorial disputes in the Western Hemisphere.

Official estimates give a death toll of 94. Demining is expected to be completed in 2024. As of 2025, it is the most recent military conflict in the Americas between countries contesting sovereignty over territory.

==Background==

The Cenepa War was the most recent military clash between Ecuador and Peru over a long-standing territorial dispute that dated back to the first decades of the 19th century, when both countries came into being after the Wars of Independence of the Spanish colonies in South America.

In modern times there were three previous military confrontations: war between 1857 and 1860, a full-scale war in 1941, the Paquisha War in 1981, both of which had seen the Peruvian military forces prevailing over the Ecuadorian military.

==Overview==

Most of the fighting of the Cenepa war was centered around the control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the Cenepa River (see map), a highland area covered with dense Amazonian jungle, inside a 78 km-long strip of territory where the process of demarcation between Ecuador and Peru remained stalled since 1951.

One of the outposts causing the dispute, called Tiwintza by the Ecuadorians, and Tiwinza by the Peruvians, came to symbolize the war because of the bitter clashes that took place around it, and the emotional importance that both sides attached to its possession. The conflict continued until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces, supervised by the MOMEP, a multinational mission of military observers from the &quot;guarantor&quot; countries of the 1942 Rio Protocol: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the USA.

The Cenepa war produced far-reaching consequences for relations between Ecuador and Peru. Among the effects of the war that paved the way for a definitive settlement of the border issues included the military outcome of the brief conflict; the lack of vindication of the Ecuadorian armed forces after the disappointing results of the wars of 1858, 1941, and 1981; and the Peruvians’ realization of the need for a resolution of a problem. Thus, in the aftermath of the war, both nations, brokered by the &quot;guarantors&quot; of the Rio Protocol, entered into a long and difficult negotiation process that concluded with the signing of a Peace Treaty in 1998, and the closing of the hitherto un-demarcated stretch of common border, deep in the Amazonian rainforest.

===Disputed border===
Following the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941, both countries had signed a Peace Treaty known as the Rio Protocol in 1942. This treaty — brokered by the US, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, which became known as the &quot;guarantors&quot; of the peace settlement — had the main purpose of defining the hitherto badly defined borders between Ecuador and Peru. The process of demarcation, begun in mid-1942, came to a halt in 1948, when populist Ecuadorian President José María Velasco Ibarra declared the Protocol impossible to implement in the area of the &quot;Cordillera del Cóndor&quot;, claiming inconsistencies between the instructions of the Protocol and the geographical realities on the ground. Peru contested this view, stating that such discrepancies had already been solved in an arbitration that had taken place in 1945, and that all that had to be done was to close the border following the guidelines of the Protocol and the ruling of the 1945 arbitration.

By the beginning of the 1950s, the situation had come to a deadlock. For the next 46 years, a 78 km-long strip of mostly unpopulated, and little explored territory, deep in the Amazonian rainforest and almost inaccessible by land, was left without a specific boundary; this served as a flashpoint for recurrent diplomatic and military crisis between Ecuador and Peru. While Peru held to the view that the border in the area ran along the heights of the Condor range, Ecuador insisted that there was no technical basis for considering that mountain range as the border between the two nations, hinting at the idea that the spirit of the Protocol, which had never mentioned the &quot;Cóndor&quot; range by name, would require the location of the border markers along the Cenepa River, immediately to the east of the range. The Ecuadorian stance had a symbolic meaning of its own: the Cenepa river was a small tributary of the Marañón River, in turn a tributary of the Amazon River, to which Ecuador had always claimed the right for sovereign access.

===Events leading up to the war===
Just as in the Paquisha Incident of 1981, the Cenepa War was caused by the installation by Ecuador, since 1994, of border outposts on the Cenepa River basin in eastern Cordillera del Condor (territory also claimed by Peru), with the names of Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur and Tiwinza.

Tensions along the Condor range had been running high following a crisis that arose in July 1991 over the location of a Peruvian outpost called &quot;Pachacútec&quot; (Pachacútec Incident) inside a zone that, while 60 km north of the delimited and undemarcated area, had its own problems regarding the location of a single border marker (see map). Ecuador had protested over the location of &quot;Pachacútec&quot; since it was, according to Ecuador, inside Ecuadorian territory, and went on to set up an outpost of its own (&quot;Etza&quot;) right in front of it. For Peru, there was no question that both &quot;Pachacútec&quot; and &quot;Etza&quot; were inside Peruvian territory. Although the crisis was defused the following month with the signing of a &quot;Pacto de Caballeros&quot; (gentlemen&#x27;s agreement), by which both sides committed themselves to abandon these posts and separate their forces, the aftermath of the incident saw both countries accusing each other of violating the accord and reinforcing their military presence in the delimited and undemarcated area.

==New crisis==
Still, for the next three years, tensions were kept at manageable levels. Apart from the uneasy encounters between rival patrols, which sometimes included brief exchanges of fire, most commonly every January (anniversary of the signing of the Rio Protocol), no serious incidents happened.

Then, at the end of 1994, a new crisis suddenly erupted, this time in the undemarcated border area proper, around the Condor range and the Cenepa headwaters.

===&quot;Base Sur&quot; and a meeting of colonels===
Peruvian accounts state that in November 1994, a Peruvian patrol, advancing through the Cenepa headwaters, was intercepted by an Ecuadorian patrol. Being told they had crossed into Ecuadorian territory, the Peruvians were escorted to the Ecuadorian outpost of &quot;Base Sur&quot;, where the patrol was given supplies before continuing their journey. Afterwards, realizing Base Sur was actually in Peruvian-claimed territory, the Peruvians asked the Ecuadorians for a meeting of superior officers. The meeting, which the Peruvians date to December 20 and the Ecuadorians to December 12, took place in &quot;Base Sur&quot;, between the commanders of the opposing battalions in the area.

According to Ecuadorian accounts, during the meeting the Peruvian officer called to the attention of his Ecuadorian counterpart that the presence of Ecuadorian outposts in the headwaters of the Cenepa river constituted a violation of Peruvian territory, and that therefore the posts had to be abandoned and the troops moved back to the line of the Condor range. The Ecuadorian account of the meeting also states that the Peruvian officer went on to deliver an ultimatum: if the Ecuadorians did not abandon the area by the end of the week, the Peruvians would dislodge them by force.

After the meeting — if not before it — both Quito and Lima began to send reinforcements to the area, while further meetings between superior officers didn&#x27;t manage to break the deadlock, apparently unable to reach a compromise solution.

===In retrospect===
It could be said that the Cenepa war had the same causes that caused the Peruvian victory in the false Paquisha of 1981, that is, the Peruvian discovery of Ecuadorian outposts on the eastern slopes of the Condor mountain range by expelled Ecuadorian troops from the territory in dispute. And further down in the Cenepa Valley, followed by the decision to evict Ecuadorians from these places by force.

The Ecuadorian Army, evidently bent on preventing any repetition of the &quot;Pachacútec&quot; incident, and to forestall any Peruvian attempt to reach to crests of the Condor range, had gone on to establish a &quot;defensive&quot; perimeter on the area of Cenepa valley, with two outposts, &quot;Tiwinza&quot; and &quot;Base Sur&quot;, on the Cenepa headwaters (i.e. in the eastern side of the Cordillera del Cóndor, in Peru&#x27;s land), and a larger outpost, &quot;Coangos&quot;, on the high ground overlooking them from the north (see map).

In turn, the &quot;guarantors&quot; (Warrantors) military considered offensive both Ecuadorian and Peruvian moves, due to the fact that, lacking official border markers, the Ecuadorian and Peruvian military had long since agreed to consider the line of the Condor range a &quot;de facto&quot; border, already considered broken by both countries since 1981.

==Mobilizing for war==
During the second half of December both sides began to hastily reinforce their military presence in and around the Cenepa valley area, laying down new minefields, preparing supply bases, and intensifying the patrolling activity.

By the end of December, profiting from its internal lines of communications, the Ecuadorian Army had strengthened to a considerable degree its presence in the area, having deployed a number of units, foremost among them several Special Forces formations, as well as artillery and BM-21 multiple rocket launchers on the heights of the &quot;Cordillera del Cóndor&quot;. The entire Ecuadorian perimeter was covered by antiaircraft batteries and, most significantly, several teams carrying Soviet-made SA-16 Igla and British-made Blowpipe man-portable surface-to-air missiles.

Meanwhile, the Ecuadorian Air Force (FAE) was frantically getting up to operational status its fleet of subsonic and supersonic jet aircraft, and adapting existing airfields in southeastern Ecuador to function as forward-deployment bases. For the Ecuadorian military, especially the Army and Air Force, the memories of the conflict of 1981 and its embarrassing outcome were still fresh, the lessons learned, and every measure was taken to avoid a similar outcome if and when the threat of war became a reality.

For the Peruvian military, the mobilization process was somewhat more problematic. The Cenepa valley area was devoid of any major roads, population centers, or helicopter bases on the Peruvian side. The Peruvian Army and the Peruvian Air Force (FAP), had to organize an air-bridge to get reinforcements to the zone. Troops, heavy weapons, ammunition and supplies had to be flown in first from the Peruvian hinterland and Lima to Bagua AFB, where they were transferred to light transport aircraft for the flight to the Ciro Alegría base. From this base, the final flight to the Peruvian forward bases in the Cenepa valley, mainly Observation Post 1 (PV-1), was made aboard Peru&#x27;s Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-17 helicopter fleet, very often under poor weather conditions, with heavy rain and low cloud cover.

Altogether, by the third week of January, both Peru and Ecuador had managed to deploy around 5,000 troops to the immediate vicinity of the delimited and undemarcated area.

==First encounters==
With the coming of the new year, crisis loomed in the Cenepa valley. By 8 January the Peruvian Army had deployed four patrols near Base Sur.
On the night of 9 January 1995, Ecuadorian troops found and captured four Peruvian soldiers that according to the Ecuadorian accounts were supposedly reconnoitering the approaches to the Ecuadorian outpost of Cueva de los Tayos. Following the customary regulations put in place by both armies for the handling of such instances, the so-called &quot;Cartillas de Seguridad y Confianza&quot; (Guidelines for Safety and Mutual Confidence), the captured Peruvian personnel were delivered to their own officers without further incident.

Always following the Ecuadorian accounts, a subsequent incident took place two days later, on January 11, when another Peruvian patrol was detected near a place called the &quot;Y&quot;, a point of tactical importance in the Ecuadorian lines. Shots were fired, apparently causing no casualties on either side.

==Open war==
By the third week of January, the Peruvian high command had deployed to the Cenepa area what it considered to be enough troops to clear any and all Ecuadorian troops on the Eastern side of the Cordillera del Cóndor. In retrospect, it is likely that Lima was expecting a repetition of the 1981 incident, unaware of the scale of the Ecuadorian deployment. Thus, as a preliminary to the attack, on 21 January Peruvian helicopters began a series of reconnaissance and troop insertion flights on the rear of the Ecuadorian positions, which continued for the next two days. The next day, 22 January, the Ecuadorians detected around twenty Peruvian troops setting up a heliport to the north and rear of the Ecuadorian forward outposts.

The stepping up of the Peruvian air operations, combined with the surprise discovery of a Peruvian base on the rear of the Ecuadorian perimeter, compelled the Ecuadorian high command to take the initiative. That same day, a reinforced Special Forces company was ordered to advance undetected through the dense jungle and dislodge the Peruvians from the site, named by the Ecuadorians&#x27; &quot;Base Norte&quot;. Significantly, the decision to act was made by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army before informing the President of the Republic, Sixto Durán-Ballén, and his National Security Council.

The Ecuadorian high command had by then interpreted the opinion of the Commander in Chief of the Peruvian armed forces, General Nicolás de Bari Hermoza, to respond to calls from his Ecuadorian counterpart as a signal that the Peruvian military, with or without the knowledge of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, was preparing a military operation in the Cenepa valley.

The next day, the decision to act already taken, the Ecuadorian local commander informed his Peruvian counterpart that, from 24 January onwards, any Peruvian helicopter flying over Ecuadorian positions would be shot down. On the morning of Thursday, 26 January 1995, after three days of march, the Ecuadorian Special Forces detachment arrived undetected at the small Peruvian outpost &quot;Base Norte&quot; and launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting garrison. A fierce firefight ensued, but the Peruvians were eventually forced to disperse through the jungle, leaving behind a number of dead soldiers, as well as weapons and supplies. The Cenepa War had begun.

But it was the Peruvian troops that finally evicted the Ecuadorian troops from their territory after the intense bombardment by land and air of the bases of the Cave of the Tayos, the South Base and the false Tiwinza.

===Chronology of the War===
The following days, the events unfolded in quick succession. Below is a complete chronological summary of the war.
*24 January: Peru mobilizes troops towards Tiwinza, Ecuador engages in preparing the FAE (Ecuadorian Air Force), Ecuadorian fighter jets.
*25 January: Peru militarizes a site in the Condor strip later known as Base Sur, thus provoking reaction by Ecuadorian forces, initiating the war.
*26 January: Peruvian conscripts setting up a heliport in Quebrada Fashin, behind the Ecuadorian outposts built in Peru&#x27;s land since 1994, are attacked by Ecuadorian Special Forces, dislodging the Peruvians from the site; the Ecuadorians name the place &quot;Base Norte&quot;. Thus begins the shooting war.
*27 January: Ecuador and Peru order general mobilization. Armored units are deployed to the Pacific coast border area, ready to act in case of a general war. Altogether, around 140,000 men were mobilized during the war.
*28 January: At 7:45, the Peruvians launch the first ground assault against the Ecuadorian positions in the Cenepa headwaters. The attack is renewed at 11:05, this time with helicopters providing suppressive fire. At 09:00 a Peruvian Air Force (FAP) Bell 212 helicopter was damaged in its fuel tank by Ecuadorian fire. At 12:05, Peruvian ground attack aircraft make their first appearance over the valley, but withdraw upon being informed of the presence of FAE interceptors in the area.
*29 January: In a pattern that will continue during the next days, Peruvian forces launch multiple and simultaneous attacks all over the area, in an effort to off-balance the Ecuadorian defenses. The Ecuadorians fight back at Tiwinza, Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur, and Coangos, and shoot down a Soviet-made Mi-8TV helicopter (EP-587) belonging to the Peruvian Army Aviation (AEP) becomes the first confirmed kill for the Ecuadorian MANPADS teams on the ground. At the end of the day, Peru announces having captured three Ecuadorian strongholds as a result of the day&#x27;s actions, which Ecuador goes on to deny.
*31 January: After a 24-hours lull in the fight, the Peruvians resume their attacks against Tiwinza, Coangos, and Cueva de los Tayos. Ecuador and Peru reject an international appeal for an immediate ceasefire.
*1 February: The assaults continue, now with strong artillery support. Peruvian A-37B ground attack aircraft appear over the battlefield and bomb Ecuadorian positions. The Ecuadorian base of Cóndor Mirador, on the summit of the Cordillera del Cóndor falls also under attack. A Peruvian patrol approaching Cueva de los Tayos hits a minefield and suffers severe losses.
*2 February: During the day, the FAP carries out no less than twelve ground attack sorties, in support of the ground troops assaulting Cueva de los Tayos and Base Sur. FAE interceptors, still flying from bases too far north, near Guayaquil, appear too late to find any targets.
*3 February: Ecuadorian Strikemasters and A-37B ground attack aircraft appear for the first time to bomb Peruvian positions.
*4 February: Peruvian Tucanos bomb Ecuadorian positions in the valley during a night bombing sortie.
*6 February: The FAP begins to make use of its Canberra jet bombers to strike Ecuadorian positions. One Canberra is lost perhaps crashed into a mountain due to the bad weather conditions over the area.
*7 February: In a bitter reminder of the dangers that the Cenepa valley pose for low-speed aircraft flying at low-altitudes, a FAP Mi-25 helicopter gunship is downed after being hit in quick succession by at least two (probably three) SA-16s shoulder-fired missiles. FAE A-37Bs, escorted by Kfir fighters, continue to attack Peruvian positions. One A-37B is hit by Peruvian AA fire, but manages to get back to base.
*9 February: Heavy air activity. The FAP carries out no less than 16 ground attack sorties, throwing its fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bombers into the battle. FAP Canberras carry out a night bombing mission.

*10 February: Heavy air activity continues over the battlezone. During the morning, the FAP sends in A-37Bs and Sukhoi Su-22 to strike Ecuadorian positions. The FAE steps in. At 12:42, the Ecuadorian radars pick up five enemy targets approaching for another round of attacks. Two FAE Mirage F.1JAs and two IAI Kfir C.2s are sent to intercept the incoming aircraft. In the ensuing action an A-37B subsonic aircraft is shot down by a Kfir and two Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22s were claimed to be shot down by the Ecuadorian Mirage F1 respectively. Peru, however, denied that the two Sukhoi Su-22s were shot down by Mirages, stating that one was struck by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery during a low-flying ground-attack mission, and the second because of an engine fire. Regarding the two downed Su-22s, the Ecuadorian Air Force never showed the HUD videos of the Ecuadorian fighters shooting down the Su-22s.

*11 February: Further Peruvian Special Forces reinforcements arrive at PV-1. As the ground war drags on, air activity over the area increases. Encouraged by the events of the day before, the Ecuadorian A-37Bs launch even bolder ground-attack missions on Peruvian positions. One FAE A-37B is hit by a Peruvian MANPADS.
*12 February: Air operations continue. The Peruvians claim the destruction of one A-37B and one Kfir, both of them denied by Ecuador.
*13 February: Peruvian forces launch powerful attacks against Coangos and Tiwinza, with heavy air support. One Peruvian Mi-8TV is lost to Ecuadorian fire. In the evening, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori appears before the cameras to claim the taking of Tiwinza (Tiwinza &quot;I&quot; Cota 1209) and total victory for Peru. However the Ecuadorians denied this claim by &quot;showing the position of Tiwinza&quot; by GPS, but their coordinates were false.
*14–16 February: Combat continues all along the area.
*17 February: In the presence of the four guarantor countries of the Rio Protocol (the US, Brazil, Chile, Argentina), Ecuadorian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marcelo Fernández de Córdoba, and Peruvian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eduardo Ponce, sign a peace declaration in Brazil (&quot;Declaración de Paz de Itamaraty&quot;), confirming a ceasefire, a separation of forces, a general demobilization, and establishing a &quot;guarantors&quot; peacekeeping force, the MOMEP (Military Observer Mission, Ecuador Peru), charged with supervising the separation of forces, taking over the posts of Tiwinza and Base Sur, and suggesting the limits for an eventual demilitarized zone. Ecuador and Peru pledge themselves to begin talks on the &quot;pending issues&quot;.
*21 February: The first MOMEP observers arrive to the Ecuadorian rear base of Patuca, but confused fighting rages on all-day long, preventing the observers to reach the area of the conflict. Ecuador claims Peruvian helicopters are violating the cease-fire by flying over the Ecuadorian posts.
*22 February: In a day that Ecuadorians refer to as &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;, Peruvian forces launch a strong attack on Ecuadorian positions in Cenepa valley (Tiwinza Cota 1061). According to Ecuadorian sources, fourteen of their soldiers died that day, the worst in terms of casualties for the Ecuadorian Army during the war. That afternoon and night, the Ecuadorian forces retaliate against Peruvians positions until the next day, when intense activity was detected in the Peruvian lines, identified by the Ecuadorian officers as the evacuation of the casualties caused by the offensive the night before.
*28 February: After more days of confusing skirmishes, Ecuador and Peru sign the Montevideo Declaration, &quot;reiterating their commitment to proceed to an immediate and effective ceasefire&quot;. Although minor incidents would continue all over the area during the next months, the Cenepa War is officially over.

==Aftermath==
*Negotiated ceasefire and withdrawal of troops from the combat zone.
*The conflict ends on March 28, 1995, with the signing of &quot;Reiteration of the commitment to stop an immediate and effective ceasefire&quot;, after the guarantor countries established a demilitarized zone.
*Ecuadorian troops were forced to withdraw to the western side of the Cordillera del Cóndor as well as the entire head of the Cenepa River without having achieved their objective of obtaining the disputed territory and having sovereign access to the Amazon to compel Peru to a new delimitation in its borders. The posts installed by Ecuador came to be controlled by the Peruvian Army
* Ecuador recognizes the authenticity and validity of the Rio Protocol and renounces its thesis of unenforceability of the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol and its aspiration to be a coastal country of the Amazon River as well as its claim of sovereignty over the Marañón river. 
*The disputed territories are recognized as Peruvian. Tiwinza (cota 1061) was recognized by the guarantors as Peruvian territory. 
*Ecuador receives 1 km2 in Tiwinza (level 1061) as &quot;private property&quot;, without sovereignty and only for commemorative and non-military acts. Anyone born in Tiwinza (20 km²) will be considered Peruvian Cenepa. Hoy 17 de Febrero de 1995 culmina la Guerra del Cenepa — Español 
*Brasilia Presidential Act signed on the 26 October 1998, closing the frontier, as stated in Protocolo de Rio de Janeiro, and declaring the end to all differences between the two nations.
By the beginning of March 1995, the MOMEP observers had entered the area and began to supervise the separation of forces. In accordance with the Treaty of Itamaraty and the Declaration of Montevideo, the Ecuadorians began to withdraw all their units to the base of Coangos, while the Peruvians were to do the same to PV-1. From there, troops would be extracted according to a schedule implement by the MOMEP. All combatants were withdrawn from the delimited and undemarcated area by May 5, 1995. A demilitarized zone came into effect on August 4 of the same year. Ecuador and Peru went on to negotiate the final demarcation of the border, in a lengthy process marked by one crisis after another, with a total war almost erupting in August 1998. Finally, on October 26, 1998, in Brasília, Jamil Mahuad, President of Ecuador, and Alberto Fujimori, President of Peru, along with the Presidents of Brazil, Argentina, and Chile; and a personal representative of the President of the United States of America, signed a Presidential Act, which proclaimed &quot;the definitive resolution of the border disputes between the two nations&quot;.

In a decision that certain political sectors on both sides took as a setback, the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol determined that the boundary of the delimited and undemarcated zone was in fact the Cordillera del Cóndor line, as Peru had been claiming from the 1940s. While Ecuador was forced to renounce its decades-old territorial claims as Tumbes, Jaen and Maynas as well as on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, as well as the entire western area of the Cenepa headwaters, Peru &quot;gives&quot; to Ecuador, as a &quot;private property&quot; but without sovereignty and only for commemorative and non-military events, one square kilometer of its territory, in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza was located (level 1061), focal point of the war, inside the Peruvian soil, anyone born in Tiwinza will be considered Peruvian. The final demarcation of the border came into effect on May 13, 1999.

===Casualties and material losses===
Figures given for losses during the Cenepa War vary widely, especially regarding human casualties. Ecuadorian military sources put the casualties at 34 killed recognized by Comando Conjunto de las FFAA del Ecuador and 154 killed and wounded recognized by Asociación de ex combatientes del Cenepa, Quito, Ecuador. As of February 2005, an Ecuadorian Cenepa war veterans&#x27; association had a membership of 131 ex-combatants, some of them with long-term health disorders caused by the war.
ALDHU, a human rights NGO, has put the total number of mortal casualties for both sides at around 500. This figure was also given by Ecuadorian senior officers after the war, reflecting the fact that Peruvians found themselves attacking well-protected Ecuadorian positions and subjected to continuous ambushes and well-aimed artillery and rocket fire from the heights of the Condor range.

The aircraft and helicopter losses mentioned above represent the losses acknowledged by each side during the conflict due to enemy action or to accidents, as cited in the . According to the same source, Peru may have lost up to three helicopters during the conflict, and Ecuador may have lost one attack helicopter in unclear circumstances. Faundes, citing Ecuadorian sources, puts the total of Peruvian losses at four fixed-wing aircraft and three helicopters. Both sources agree that Ecuador lost one AT-33A trainer in an accident outside the combat area, three fallen A-37 and two defective Kfir cannot return to the theater of operations in the conflict.

===Illegal armament sale controversy===
====Chile====
During the war, a series of Peruvian newspapers brought forth information claiming that Chile had sold armament to Ecuador during the conflict. This claim was promptly denied by Chile the following day on February 5, 1995, but admitted that they had sold weaponry to Ecuador on September 12, 1994, as part of a regular commercial exchange that had no aim against any particular nation. The source of this deal has been traced back to 1977, when the military regime of Augusto Pinochet signed an agreement with the Ecuadorian military authorities then ruling the country (headed by Alfredo Poveda) for the sale of armament by the state-run FAMAE factory. That contract was reportedly renewed around the reported time of the registered legal sale (September 1994), which led to the aforementioned shipment of military hardware to Ecuador. In 1995, and due to lack of further information, Peru&#x27;s president, Alberto Fujimori, put a momentary end to the scandal.

However, the controversy was once again ignited when General Víctor Manuel Bayas, former Chief of Staff of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces during the Cenepa War, made a series of declarations in regards to the armed conflict between Peru and Ecuador. On March 21, 2005, General Bayas was asked by the Ecuadorian newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot; if Chile had sold armaments to Ecuador during the Cenepa War, to which he replied: “&quot;Yes, it was a contract with the militaries during the conflict.&quot; Furthermore, General Bayas revealed that Argentina and Russia had also sold weaponry to Ecuador during the conflict. Later that same year, on April 11, Colonel Ernesto Checa, Ecuador&#x27;s military representative in Chile during the Cenepa War, stated that Chile provided Ecuador with &quot;ammunition, rifles and night vision devices&quot; during the war. Moreover, the Peruvian government revealed that it held knowledge that during the war at least a couple of Ecuadorian C-130 transport airplanes had landed in Chilean territory to pick up 9mm ammunition, and that the Ecuadorian Air Force had planned three more of those armament acquisition voyages to Chile. Nonetheless, the Peruvian government at that time regarded this as a minor incident due to the Chilean Sub-secretary of Foreign Relations, Mariano Fernández, telling the Peruvian ambassador in Chile, Alfonso de Rivero, on February 2, 1995, that the Chilean government would take immediate measures to stop any other possible operations of this nature. In this communication, Fernández is reported to have concurred to de Rivero&#x27;s residence and revealed that only 9mm ammunition, which had been paid with anticipation, had been loaded in the Ecuadorian planes; that a Chilean lawyer representing Ecuador had demanded the fulfillment of the contract and that Ecuadorian military personnel who came on the plane asked for additional armament, only to have this petition denied; however Peruvian &quot;Caretas&quot; magazine reported that part of this information wasn&#x27;t precise (without specifying which part). Apparently, the Chilean authorities were being sincere, as President Frei only took notice of the departure of the Ecuadorian Hercules planes (loaded only with ammunition) hours after they had left.

Chile&#x27;s response to the declarations made by General Bayas were made the following day on March 22, 2005. The government of Chile denied the claims and stated that the only registered sale of weapons to Ecuador was in 1994. Jaime Ravinet, the Chilean Minister of Defense, assured that any other armament transfer after the 1994 date had been illegal. Ravinet further stated that, after discussing the matter with his Peruvian counterpart, Roberto Chiabra, the situation had been resolved. Yet, the Peruvian government did not find the February 5, 1995, and March 22, 2005, declarations as acceptable or sufficient; and went on to send a note of protest to the Chilean government. Peru further claimed that Chile should have maintained absolute neutrality and that this alleged weapons commerce during the Cenepa War went against resolutions made by the United Nations and the Organization of American States.

In the end, the whole operation was revealed to be the planning of former dictator Pinochet, then chief of the Armed Forces (until 1998). Quoting Peruvian ambassador to Chile in 1995 (de Rivero), the Chilean Sub-secretary (Fernández) &quot;pointed out to me that President Frei and chancellor (foreign minister) Insulza had been deeply worried by the situation and that they were taking all the dispositions of the case to reform the military sales law&quot;&quot;. Reportedly, Pinochet himself later assumed direct responsibility for the shipment before the civilian authorities of his country (even if his lawyer denied it in 2005), as he still exercised considerable influence over state institutions and controlled the security apparatus, thus having power to bypass civilian controls to foreign arms sales. It is worth noting that Pinochet, who had lived in Ecuador during the second half of the 1950s as a military instructor, had a deep affection towards the country and, a couple of years later, in November–December 1997, made a controversial and highly publicized visit to Ecuador where he attended a series of ceremonies and was given six military and civilian decorations by that country&#x27;s civilian and military authorities.

====Argentina====
Argentina admitted to the illegal sale of armament by revealing the existence of three secret decrees signed by President Carlos Menem between the years of 1991 and 1995. The controversy regarding the decrees came about when the weapons sold did not go to Panama, Bolivia, and Venezuela as had been accorded, but instead the weapons ended up in Croatia and Ecuador at times when both of these nations were involved in wars and prohibited from receiving international military aid. The sale Argentina gave to Ecuador included 6.500 tons of rifles, cannons, anti-tank rockets, and ammunition. Menem was taken to court for his alleged association with these illegal acts in 2001, but was acquitted by Argentina&#x27;s Supreme Court. In October 2008 the case was re-opened, but Menem avoided being detained by Argentine authorities until 2010 due to his position as senator of La Rioja. Menem claimed to have had no association with the illegal weapons trade, and further adds that this is a political persecution made by Argentine president Cristina Fernández and, her husband and also former Argentine president, Néstor Kirchner. In 2013 Carlos Menem was sentenced to seven years in prison for arms-smuggling.

==Characteristics of the fighting in 1995==

Several explanations have been brought forward to explain the outcome of the Cenepa conflict. Some of these can be briefly summarized here:

*Logistics. Both during the buildup of forces and during the clashes of January and February, the Peruvian Army found itself at a logistical disadvantage. The fact that all reinforcements and supplies had to be flown in by helicopter from Ciro Alegría base, more than 110 km to the south, meant that, in general, the Ecuadorian forces went into combat better armed and supplied. Moreover, once the shooting war started, the Cenepa valley became a rather dangerous place for the Peruvian Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-17 helicopters, which besides their transport duties also carried out ground-attack missions.
*Force Composition. Right from the very first clashes, the Ecuadorian Army committed Special Forces units all along the combat area. In addition to the paratroopers, the Ecuadorians sent into battle a number of &quot;Iwia&quot; detachments — units composed of tribal people such as the Shuar people, specialized in jungle combat and survival. Until the arrival of some elite counterinsurgency units from the south (battle-hardened by a leftist insurgency) the Peruvian forces committed to the battle were composed mostly of young and inexperienced conscripts.
*Terrain. In 1995, the Ecuadorian Army fought on terrain of its own choosing. From the heights of the Condor mountain range, the Ecuadorians had a commanding view of the entire combat area. The Ecuadorian artillery -carefully camouflaged on the reverse slopes of the Condor range- could deliver precise and deadly fire upon attacking Peruvian troops. By the same token, the Ecuadorian antiaircraft batteries and SAMs located on the heights made helicopter low-level flight into the valley a dangerous proposition.
*State of the opposing air forces at the outbreak of the crisis. The war of 1995 came at a bad moment for the Peruvian Air Force, as the economic crisis that had struck the nation in the 1980s had a negative impact on the readiness of the FAP. At the beginning of January 1995, with a crisis looming on the horizon, the FAP found itself in no shape for a major air war. Most of its fleet of modern Mirage 2000Ps interceptors, bought in the mid-1980s and the backbone of the FAP, was grounded for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance due to lack of funds. Only three Mirage 2000Ps were immediately available for active operations. Its fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bombers was in the same situation, with some seven aircraft in flying condition; the lack of preparedness even affected the Cessna A-37B subsonic counterinsurgency and ground-attack aircraft. Although by the end of January the situation regarding operational aircraft had greatly improved, the crisis had probably left its impact on the FAP. Ecuador had also passed through a period of economic crisis of its own, but the FAE had kept in operational status a sizeable part of its fleet of Mirage F.1JAs, IAI Kfir C.2s, and SEPECAT Jaguars, with perhaps some ten Mirages, ten Kfirs, and four or six Jaguars in serviceable condition. Thus, while smaller in total number of planes, the FAE of January 1995 felt qualitatively capable of facing the FAP on equal terms - in striking contrast to the situation during the crisis of 1981, where except for a small number of missions, the FAE had been kept on the ground armed and ready for immediate action, to be committed only in case of a full-fledged war. In 1995 their positions in the Cordillera del Cóndor were well defended due to tactically placed SAMs, and units armed with British-made Blowpipe missiles and Russian-made SA-16 MANPADS. Nevertheless, such defences didn&#x27;t stop the continuous raids of the Peruvian Air Force.

<text>Marlon David Jackson (born March 12, 1957) is an American singer, songwriter, and dancer best known as a member of the Jackson 5. He is the sixth child of the Jackson family. Marlon now runs Study Peace Foundation to promote peace and unity worldwide.

==Early life==

Marlon David Jackson was born on March 12, 1957, at St Mary&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in Gary, Indiana, the sixth child of Joseph who was a steel mill worker, and played in an R&amp;B band, the Falcons, with his brother Luther, and Katherine Jackson, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. He was born one year and a half earlier than his younger brother Michael (born August 29, 1958). Growing up, Marlon was especially close to Michael, whom he considered the substitute for his lost twin brother, Brandon David Jackson, who died shortly after birth. &quot;We were the jokers of the family,&quot; Marlon said. 

By 1964, Marlon and Michael joined their brothers Tito, Jackie and Jermaine, forming the group the Jackson 5. Their mother, Katherine, played the piano and clarinet, and sang harmonies with the brothers. Their father, Joe, led the rehearsals, keeping them off the street and away from trouble. They won singing competitions all over the state including New York. That marked the beginning of their career. Marlon was not the most prominent member of the Jackson 5, though he did sing background vocals on many of their hits. He also played the conga and tambourine. Brother Randy later joined the band when Jermaine chose to stay at Motown after the group left the label and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Marlon has three sisters; Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet.

== Career ==

=== The Jackson 5 ===

Marlon and his brothers first signed as the Jackson 5 with Gordon Keith of Steeltown Records in November 1967, and their first single &quot;Big Boy&quot;, was released on January 31, 1968. After the group recorded three more songs with the Steeltown label (on two records) they were signed with Berry Gordy of Motown Records in 1969. Not feeling that they were being paid fair royalties by Motown Records for their success as well as their desire for creative control, the Jackson 5 decided to leave the label and sign with Epic Records in 1975. Jermaine split from the Jackson Five to start a solo career at Motown, and was replaced by his brother Randy Jackson. Unbeknownst to the group, Gordy had trademarked the name The Jackson Five and did not allow the group to continue using the name when they left the label. Once signed with Epic, the group became known simply as The Jacksons. In 1983, Gordy asked the group to perform at the &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; television special. In 1997, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 with his brothers. In 2001, he reunited with his brothers to perform for the Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Special.

=== Solo career ===
Like Michael and Jermaine, Marlon began a solo career, releasing the album &quot;Baby Tonight&quot; in 1987. Despite &quot;Baby Tonight&quot; reaching No. 22 on the Top R&amp;B Albums chart in the United States, Marlon has not released another album since then.

===Later work===
Marlon was successful within real estate in Southern California. In 1999, Marlon started running the Major Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) along with Florida attorney Willie E. Gary, baseball player Cecil Fielder, boxer Evander Holyfield, and Alvin James. MBC was a religious network based in Atlanta. In October 1, 2004, they rebranded as Black Family Channel. In May 2007, the Black Family Channel was sold to the Gospel Music Channel, now known as Up TV. In 2008, Marlon and a board of new partners founded the Motherland Group LLC; its purpose is to bring recognition to ancient Badagry, Nigeria for education and tourism, while preserving its history.

Marlon now runs the Study Peace Foundation, founded in 2015, aimed to promote peace and unity in communities worldwide offering programs designed to engage children, adults and the elderly to live in peaceful environments. &quot;As a community we all should know that promoting peace and unity would cause a chain reaction that children will observe. It all starts with what we make accessible to the children,&quot; he said. The foundation went into a partnership with KABOOM! to build playgrounds in New Orleans, Gary and Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
===Family===
In August 1975, 18-year-old Jackson married his girlfriend, Carol Ann Parker, whom he met in New Orleans during one of the Jacksons&#x27; tours. Marlon and Parker have three children:

* Valencia Caroline Jackson (born December 18, 1976)
* Brittany Shauntee Jackson (born September 4, 1978) 
* Marlon David Jackson Jr. (born September 23, 1981)

Marlon and Carol have six grandchildren, two from Valencia and four from Brittany.

===Michael&#x27;s memorial===
On July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center, Marlon and his family offered their final eulogies for Michael, saying he was the &quot;soul&quot; of the family, addressing the crowd: &quot;Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone&quot; and &quot;I would like for you to give our brother, my twin brother, Brandon, a hug for me.&quot; Marlon said, &quot;I love you, Michael, and I&#x27;ll miss you.&quot;. In honor of Michael, Marlon and his brothers, Tito, Jackie, Jermaine and Randy Jackson served as pallbearers wearing a gold necktie, a single white glove and sunglasses.

In a 2019 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Marlon was vocal about the allegations against his brother Michael saying, &quot;if your brother was deceased and someone wanted to slander his name, you&#x27;d be supporting him. That&#x27;s not him. That&#x27;s not his character. We definitely know our brother, and there are no facts whatsoever to corroborate these allegations.&quot; He continues, &quot;It&#x27;s a quick money grab. That&#x27;s all it is.&quot;

<text>Mia Young (born January 9, 1970), better known by her stage name Mia X, is an American rapper and songwriter from New Orleans. She enjoyed success in the local &quot;bounce&quot; scene of the early 1990s. She was the first female emcee to get a contract with rapper and entertainment magnate, Master P on his successful record label No Limit Records. She is known for collaborations with several No Limit Records artists, including Master P and Silkk the Shocker on the seminal albums, &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot;, &quot;Ghetto D&quot; and &quot;Charge It 2 Da Game&quot;.

==Personal life==
Young grew up in the Lafitte housing project in New Orleans&#x27; seventh ward. Her father was a trucker and her mother was a counselor. She graduated from Redeemer High School and briefly attended Delgado Community College before she decided to pursue a career in music.

In 2006 in a magazine article, her publicist releases a statement of an upcoming cookbook. Before her cookbook she did on online page on Instagram #teamwhipdempots. Her cookbook was finally released in 2018.

In the 2010s, Mia X was diagnosed with uterine cancer and beat it. In surgery for the cancer, the surgeons accidentally &quot;tore her cornea off&quot;, and that left her with 73% vision in one eye.

==Music career==
===Music beginnings===
Mia X&#x27;s rap career began in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s before she graduated from high school, when she performed in a &quot;mobile entertainment service&quot; called New York Inc. with Mannie Fresh, who would later rise to stardom as the production genius behind Cash Money Records. She made her recorded debut in 1992 with the single &quot;Ask them Suckas&quot; (an answer song created in response to &quot;Ask them Hoes&quot; by 39 Posse), on Lamina Records. In 1993, she released &quot;Da Payback,&quot; a maxi-single which appeared on both the Rap Dis! and Lamina Records labels, which despite its status as &quot;the No. 1-selling local record of 1993 at Odyssey Records&quot; did not generate any income for the artist.

In 1994, Mia X signed a contract for two albums with Roy Joseph, Jr.&#x27;s Emoja Records. The label (along with its successor, Slaughterhouse Records) released her full-length debut &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; in 1995. Joseph later filed a $10 million lawsuit against Master P and No Limit Records, asserting that the label &quot;persuaded Mia X to break her contract.&quot; No Limit Records subsequently filed a countersuit against Joseph asking for $20 million in damages.

===1995: TRU, No Limit Records and &quot;Good Girl Gone Bad&quot;===
In 1995, Mia X was signed to Master P&#x27;s label No Limit Records after he inquired at Peaches Records and Tapes (where she was working at the time) about promising local female rappers. She joined the roster as a solo artist and also became a member of Master P&#x27;s group at the time, TRU, where she experienced national success. She was the first female rapper to be signed by No Limit Records. On November 21, 1995, Mia X released her first album titled &quot;Good Girl Gone Bad&quot;, which failed to chart on any of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

===1997–98: &quot;Unlady Like&quot; and &quot;Mama Drama&quot;===
In 1997, she released her first single from her upcoming second album titled &quot;The Party Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; featuring Master P and Foxy Brown. On June 24, 1997, Mia X released her second album, &quot;Unlady Like&quot;, which peaked at No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 11 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The record was certified gold in October 1997.

On October 27, 1998, Mia X released her third album, &quot;Mama Drama&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.

===1999–present===
Beginning in 1999, Mia X went on hiatus from recording following the deaths of fourteen family members, including both her parents, in an eighteen-month span, in addition to the dissolution of the No Limit roster due to Master P pursuing non-musical interests. In the early 2000s, she worked in real estate and as a ghostwriter for other hip-hop artists.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Mia X recorded &quot;My FEMA People&quot; in response to the ensuing disastrous conditions in New Orleans. 

Mia X appeared on C-Murder&#x27;s 2008 release &quot;Screamin&#x27; 4 Vengeance&quot;, on tracks titled &quot;Mihita&quot; and &quot;Posted on tha Block&quot;. On June 13, 2014, she released a new single titled &quot;Mr. Right&quot;, featuring artist Ms. Tasha via her label, Mama Mia Muzic. On September 1, 2015, Mia X released a new single titled &quot;No More&quot; featuring Caren Green. She released a mixtape in 2010 titled &quot;Unladylike Forever&quot;, and claimed she was working on a new album titled &quot;Betty Rocka Locksmith&quot;, but it was never released.

<doc id="402102" wikidata="Q287184" url="?curid=402102" title="Norwegian Home Guard">
<text>The Norwegian Home Guard () is the rapid mobilization force within the Norwegian armed forces. Its main focus is local defense and civil support, but it can also detach volunteers for international operations. Its main tasks are safeguarding territorial integrity, strengthening military presence, and protecting important infrastructure.

It has land defense units, and has volunteers and conscript personnel with backgrounds from all branches. 
Founded 6 December 1946, it is the second youngest branch in the Norwegian armed forces after the Norwegian Cyber Defence Force ().

==Organization==
The Home Guard is divided into 11 districts (&quot;HV-districts&quot;), which again is divided into smaller units, typically covering a single county. In a wartime situation Heimevernet will typically be used to protect the local infrastructure and population.

The Home Guard district commanders represent a level of command subordinate to the Joint Operational Headquarters but with territorial responsibility which includes responsibility for operational planning. They also have a responsibility to the Chief of Staff of the Norwegian Home Guard for force production.

The Home Guard maintains contact with the civil community through a civil-military network based on mutual knowledge and trust. The local commanders are responsible for fostering cooperation with the police and the civil sector at local and county levels.

==Strength==
The Home Guard has 45,000 soldiers all over the country, distributed on eleven regional districts. The Home Guard also has several rapid-reaction intervention forces consisting of 3,000 voluntarily recruited and well-trained soldiers. 
== Troop exchange ==
The Home Guard does a troop exchange with the Minnesota National Guard every year. The exchange grew from Norwegian American soldiers sent to Norway to assist resistance fighters in World War II. As part of the exchange, American Guard members are flown to Værnes Air Station and Norwegians are sent to Camp Ripley. Troops complete each other&#x27;s training, and tour the area.

== The Rapid Reaction Forces ==
From 2005, the Home Guard has recruited for a high readiness force with better trained and equipped personnel. It is called the &quot;Rapid Reaction Force&quot; (). This is the spearhead of the combat force that consists of specially selected, educated and equipped personnel. The force can be mobilized rapidly and is a national resource. Effort strengths contribute to national security.

Soldiers often come from operational armed forces in the Armed Forces and commit themselves to a minimum of 3 years service each and can be ordered on a sharp mission in Norway. They must update and further develop their military competence continuously. They can attend a number of courses, task force missions and other defense activities.

There is one Rapid Reaction Force per district, in total 3,000 men and women. The Rapid Reaction Force is the speartip of the Norwegian Home Guard, and contains flexible and mobile units. It has top priority when concerning weapons, material and training resources. The force is ready to respond within hours to acts of terrorism, bomb threats, and or other emergencies. In peacetime, the RRFs can support the police and civilian community with a variety of tasks, including providing security for the public and enforcing police regulations.

The RRFs are named after operations executed during WW2 by the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (a.k.a. &quot;Linge Company&quot;):

* Oslofjord HV-district 01: RRF Polar Bear VI
* Oslo and Akershus HV-district 02: RRF Derby
* Telemark and Buskerud HV-district 03: RRF Gunnerside
* Opplandske HV-district 05: RRF Grebe
* Agder and Rogaland HV-district 08: RRF Osprey and Varg
* Bergenhus HV-district 09: RRF Bjørn West
* Møre and Fjordane HV-district 11: RRF Archery
* Trøndelag HV-district 12: RRF Rype
* Sør-Hålogaland HV-district 14: RRF Heron
* Nord-Hålogaland HV-district 16: RRF Claymore
* Finnmark HV-district 17: RRF Ida &amp; Lyra and Delfin

The Naval branch of the Home Guard used to be four RRFs. but the Norwegian government closed the units down in 2017 due to saving costs.

* South: RRF Bundle
* West: RRF Salamander
* North: RRFs Waxwing and Anklet

=== Platoons ===

The Rapid Reaction Forces consists of several different platoons within each district. In this way, each district will be able to respond to any kind of incident that could occur, without having to rely on outside help. Each district (with some variations) will have trained operators in these different types of units:

* (Ranger platoon)
* (Sniper platoon)
* (Military Police)
* (K9 unit)
* (Staff platoon – (S-1, to S-4), transport &amp; logistics)
* (Signal platoon)
* (Diving team – Underwater reconnaissance, explosives-detection)
* (Medical platoon)
* (Infantry platoons)

A Light Mechanized unit has been established in district&#x27;s 12, 14 and 16. this one is called (Multi Platoon). These platoons handle the custom made Geländewagen 290 multi III and is the speartip of the RRF&#x27;s.

In Oslo, one of the Home Guard units is styled as a cavalry squadron, and wears black cavalry berets, because it used to be equipped with M24 Chaffee light tanks and M3 White armored cars, and was manned by former army dragoons. Its main mission was the defense of the former Fornebu airport; this mission was changed to escort duties, and it is now one of the rapid response units in Oslo.

==Equipment==
Until the end of the 1960s, the Home Guard used second-hand weapons from the Norwegian Army. At the end of the period, the Home Guard was equipped with more modern and heavier weapons.

The Home Guard today uses small arms like the MP-7 submachine guns, HK416 automatic rifles, MG-3 machine gun and FN Minimi light machine guns. Additionally, the Barrett M82 sniper rifle and Glock 17 pistol are used. Additionally, the Carl Gustaf 8.4cm recoilless rifle is used by the rapid reaction forces infantry platoons.

The vehicle fleet consists mainly of Mercedes-Benz G-Class utility vehicles, ambulances, BV 206 and Scania lorries. In November 2020, The Rapid Reaction Forces received 420 new Volkswagen Amarok field wagons, to replace the older MB 240 wagons.

<text>NASA Earth Observatory is an online publishing outlet for NASA which was created in 1999. It is the principal source of satellite imagery and other scientific information pertaining to the climate and the environment which are being provided by NASA for consumption by the general public. It is funded with public money, as authorized by the United States Congress, and is part of the EOS Project Science Office located at Goddard Space Flight Center.

, NASA Earth Observatory has won the Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award in Education three times. There were a series of publicized images issued by the website in 2008, including imagery of clouds streaming over the Caspian Sea, dust storms curling off the coast of Morocco, the crumbling of the Wilkins Ice Shelf, Hurricane Bertha, and others.

<doc id="402112" wikidata="Q4751150" url="?curid=402112" title="Analytical Thomism">
<text>Analytical Thomism is a philosophical movement which promotes the interchange of ideas between the thought of Thomas Aquinas (including the philosophy carried on in relation to his thinking, called &#x27;Thomism&#x27;), and modern analytic philosophy. It is a branch of analytic scholasticism that draws on other scholastic sources, esp. John Duns Scotus. 

Scottish philosopher John Haldane first coined the term in the early 1990s and has since been one of the movement&#x27;s leading proponents. According to Haldane, &quot;analytical Thomism involves the bringing into mutual relationship of the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the ideas and concerns shared by St Thomas and his followers&quot;.

==History 19th century—World War==
The modern revival of Aquinas&#x27;s thought can be traced to the work of mid-19th Century thomists, such as Tommaso Maria Zigliara, Josef Kleutgen, Gaetano Sanseverino, and Giovanni Maria Cornoldi. This movement received an enormous impetus by Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Aeterni Patris&quot; of 1879. In the first half of the twentieth century, Edouard Hugon, Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Étienne Gilson, and Jacques Maritain, among others, carried on Leo&#x27;s call for a Thomist revival. Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers. Some of the latter then began to harmonize Thomism with broader contemporary philosophical trends. 

Similarly, the Kraków Circle in Poland used mathematical logic in presenting Thomism, which the Circle judged to have &quot;a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment, etc.&quot; The Circle has been said to be &quot;the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars&quot;.

==Postwar philosophical reception of Aquinas==
By the middle of the 20th century Aquinas&#x27;s thought came into dialogue with the analytical tradition through the work of G. E. M. Anscombe, Peter Geach, and Anthony Kenny. Anscombe was Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s student, and his successor at the University of Cambridge; she was married to Geach, himself an accomplished logician and philosopher of religion. Geach had converted to Roman Catholicism while studying at Oxford, Anscombe had converted before she came up, and both were instructed in the Faith in Oxford by the Dominican Richard Kehoe, who received them both into the Church before they met one another. Kenny, an erstwhile priest and former Catholic, became a prominent philosopher at the University of Oxford and an editor and executor of Wittgenstein&#x27;s literary estate, and is still portrayed by some as a promoter of Aquinas (Paterson &amp; Pugh, xiii-xxiii), though his denial of some basic Thomist doctrines (e.g. divine timelessness) casts doubt on this. 

Anscombe, and other Aristotelians such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, Mortimer Adler, and John Finnis, can largely be credited with the revival of &quot;virtue ethics&quot; in analytic moral theory and &quot;natural law theory&quot; in jurisprudence. Both movements draw significantly upon Aquinas.

==Notable analytical Thomists==
Philosophers and theologians working in the intersection of Thomism and analytic philosophy include:

<text>Game studies, also known as ludology (from &quot;ludus&quot;, &quot;game&quot;, and &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;study&quot;, &quot;research&quot;) or gaming theory, is the study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a field of cultural studies that deals with all types of games throughout history. This field of research utilizes the tactics of, at least, folkloristics and cultural heritage, sociology and psychology, while examining aspects of the design of the game, the players in the game, and the role the game plays in its society or culture. Game studies is oftentimes confused with the study of video games, but this is only one area of focus; in reality game studies encompasses all types of gaming, including sports, board games, etc.

Before video games, game studies was rooted primarily in anthropology. However, with the development and spread of video games, games studies has diversified methodologically, to include approaches from sociology, psychology, and other fields.

There are now a number of strands within game studies: &quot;social science&quot; approaches explore how games function in society, and their interactions with human psychology, often using empirical methods such as surveys and controlled lab experiments. &quot;Humanities-based&quot; approaches emphasise how games generate meanings and reflect or subvert wider social and cultural discourses. These often use more interpretative methods, such as close reading, textual analysis, and audience theory, methods shared with other media disciplines such as television and film studies. Social sciences and humanities approaches can cross over, for example in the case of ethnographic or folkloristic studies, where fieldwork may involve patiently observing games to try to understand their social and cultural meanings. &quot;Game design&quot; approaches are closely related to creative practice, analysing game mechanics and aesthetics in order to inform the development of new games. Finally, &quot;industrial&quot; and &quot;engineering&quot; approaches apply mostly to video games and less to games in general, and examine things such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and networking.

==History==

It was not until Irving Finkel organized a colloquium in 1990 that grew into the International Board Game Studies Association, Gonzalo Frasca popularized the term &quot;ludology&quot; (from the Latin word for game, &quot;ludus&quot;) in 1999, the publication of the first issues of academic journals like &quot;Board Game Studies&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Game Studies&quot; in 2001, and the creation of the Digital Games Research Association in 2003, that scholars began to get the sense that the study of games could (and should) be considered a field in its own right. As a young field, it gathers scholars from different disciplines that had been broadly studying games, such as psychology, anthropology, economy, education, and sociology. The earliest known use of the term &quot;ludology&quot; occurred in 1982, in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s &quot;Does Being Human Matter – On Some Interpretive Problems of Comparative Ludology.&quot;

==Social science==

One of the earliest social science theories (1971) about the role of video games in society involved violence in video games, later becoming known as the catharsis theory. The theory suggests that playing video games in which you perform violent acts might actually channel latent aggression, resulting in less aggression in the players real lives. However, a meta-study performed by Craig A. Anderson and Brad J. Bushman, in 2001, examined data starting from the 1980s up until the article was published. The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive behaviors. They concluded that exposure to violence in video games did indeed cause an increase in aggression. However, it has been pointed out, and even stressed, by psychologist Jonathan Freedman that this research was very limited and even problematic since overly strong claims were made and the authors themselves seemed extremely biased in their writings. More recent studies, such as the one performed by Christopher J. Ferguson at Texas A&amp;M International University have come to drastically different conclusions. In this study, individuals were either randomly assigned a game, or allowed to choose a game, in both the randomized and the choice conditions exposure to violent video games caused no difference in aggression. A later study (performed by the same people) looked for correlations between trait aggression, violent crimes, and exposure to both real life violence and violence in video games, this study suggests that while family violence and trait aggression are highly correlated with violent crime, exposure to video game violence was not a good predictor of violent crime, having little to no correlation, unless also paired with the above traits that had a much higher correlation. Over the past 15 years, a large number of meta-studies have been applied to this issue, each coming to its own conclusion, resulting in little consensus in the ludology community. It is also thought that even nonviolent video games may lead to aggressive and violent behaviour. Anderson and Dill seem to believe that it may be due to the frustration of playing video games that could in turn result in violent, aggressive behaviour.

Game designers Amy Jo Kim and Jane McGonigal have suggested that platforms which leverage the powerful qualities of video games in non-game contexts can maximize learning. Known as the gamification of learning, using game elements in non-game contexts extracts the properties of games from within the game context, and applies them to a learning context such as the classroom.

Another positive aspect of video games is its conducive character towards the involvement of a person in other cultural activities. The probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production). Video games by being complementary towards more traditional forms of cultural consumption, inhibit thus value from a cultural perspective.

More sociologically-informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either &#x27;negative&#x27; or &#x27;positive&#x27;, but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life.

For example, it has been suggested (Nina Fefferman) that the very popular MMO &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; could be used to study the dissemination of infectious diseases because of the accidental spread of a plague-like disease in the gameworld.

==&quot;Ludology&quot; vs &quot;narratology&quot;==
A major focus in game studies is the debate surrounding narratology and ludology. Many ludologists believe that the two are unable to exist together, while others believe that the two fields are similar but should be studied separately. Many narratologists believe that games should be looked at for their stories, like movies or novels. The ludological perspective says that games are not like these other mediums due to the fact that a player is actively taking part in the experience and should therefore be understood on their own terms. The idea that a videogame is &quot;radically different to narratives as a cognitive and communicative structure&quot; has led the development of new approaches to criticism that are focused on videogames as well as adapting, repurposing and proposing new ways of studying and theorizing about videogames. A recent approach towards game studies starts with an analysis of interface structures and challenges the keyboard-mouse paradigm with what is called a &quot;ludic interface&quot;.

Academics across both fields provide scholarly insight into the different sides of this debate. Gonzalo Frasca, a notable ludologist due to his many publications regarding game studies, argues that while games share many similar elements with narrative stories, that should not prevent games to be studied as games. He seeks not &quot;to replace the narratologic approach, but to complement it.&quot;

Jesper Juul, another notable ludologist, argues for a stricter separation of ludology and narratology. Juul argues that games &quot;for all practicality &quot;can not&quot; tell stories.&quot; This argument holds that narratology and ludology cannot exist together because they are inherently different. Juul claims that the most significant difference between the two is that in a narrative, events &quot;have to&quot; follow each other, whereas in a game the player has control over what happens.

Garry Crawford and Victoria K. Gosling argue in favor of narratives being an essential part of games as these will contribute to, and be informed by, a gamer&#x27;s personal life and identity narratives. As they write &quot;it is impossible to isolate play from the social influences of everyday life, and in turn, play will have both intended and unintended consequences for the individual and society.&quot;

Janet Murray, in support of the narratologist method of video game argues that &quot;stories can be participatory.&quot; In this argument, Murray is linking the characteristics of video games to narratives to further her point that video games should be analyzed through narratology.

Michalis Kokonis argues in favor of Gonzalo Frasca&#x27;s article entitled &quot;Ludologists love stories too: notes from a debate that never took place&quot;, which aimed to list and explain the misunderstandings, mistakes, and prejudices surrounding the narratology vs. ludology debate. Kokonis noted that &quot;endorsing [Frasca&#x27;s] constructivist spirit we will have to agree that the so-called Narratology vs. Ludology Dilemma is a false one and that this debate will have to be resolved, as it is of no help to the cause of establishing Computer Games Study as an autonomous and independent academic field.&quot;

==Other areas of research==

As is common with most academic disciplines, there are a number of more specialized areas or sub-domains of study.

===Video game pre-history===
An emerging field of study looks at the &quot;pre-history&quot; of video games, suggesting that the origins of modern digital games lie in: fairground attractions and sideshows such as shooting games; early &quot;Coney Island&quot;-style pleasure parks with elements such as large roller-coasters and &quot;haunted house&quot; simulations; nineteenth century landscape simulations such as dioramas, panoramas, planetariums, and stereographs; and amusement arcades that had mechanical game machines and also peep-show film machines.

===Games and aging===
In light of population ageing, there has been an interest into the use of games to improve the overall health and social connectedness of ageing players. For example, Adam Gazzaley and his team have designed NeuroRacer (a game that improves cognitive tasks outside of the game among its 60+ year old participants), while the AARP has organized a game jam to improve older people&#x27;s social connections. Researchers such as Sarah Mosberg Iversen have argued that most of the academic work on games and ageing has been informed by notions of economical productivity, while Bob De Schutter and Vero Vanden Abeele have suggested a game design approach that is not focused on age-related decline but instead is rooted in the positive aspects of older age.

=== Queer game studies ===

Queer game studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that examines the intersection of video games and queer theory. It explores how video games serve as a platform for the expression and exploration of queer experiences, identities, and desires. While traditional understandings of LGBTQ representation in games focus on the inclusion of queer characters or narratives, queer game studies broadens this perspective to encompass the ways in which games themselves can be played, interpreted, and designed through queer standpoints.

===Virtual economies in gaming===
Massive multiplayer online games can give economists clues about the real world. Markets based on digital information can be fully tracked as they are used by players, and thus real problems in the economy, such as inflation, deflation and even recession. The solutions the game designers come up with can therefore be studied with full information, and experiments can be performed where the economy can be studied as a whole. These games allow the economists to be omniscient, they can find every piece of information they need to study the economy, while in the real world they have to work with presumptions.

Former Finance Minister of Greece and Valve&#x27;s in-house economist Yanis Varoufakis studied &quot;EVE Online&quot; as a measure for the Greek economic recovery and argued that video game communities such as &quot;Neopets&quot; and &quot;Fortnite&quot; give economists a venue for experimenting and simulating the economies of the future. Edward Castronova has studied virtual economies within a variety of games including Everquest and World of Warcraft.

=== Cognitive benefits ===
The psychological research into games has yielded theories on how playing video games may be advantageous for both children and for adults. Some theories claim that video games in fact help improve cognitive abilities rather than impede their development. These improvement theories include the improvement of visual contrast sensitivity. Other developments include the ability to locate something specific among various impediments. This is primarily done in first-person shooter games where the protagonist must look at everything in a first person view while playing. By doing this they increase their spatial attention due to having to locate something among an area of diversions. These games place the player in a high intensity environment where the player must remain observant of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal, e.g., shooting an enemy player, while impediments obstruct their gameplay in the virtual world.

Another cognitive enhancement provided by playing video games would be the improvement of brain functioning speed. This happens as the player is immersed in an unendingly changing environment where they are required to constantly think and problem solve while playing in order to do well in the game. This constant problem solving forces the brain to constantly run and so the speed of thought is sharpened greatly, because the need to think quickly is required to succeed. The attention span of the player is also benefited. High action video games, such as fighting or racing games, require the user&#x27;s constant attention and in the process the skill of concentration is sharpened.

The overcoming of the condition known as dyslexia is also considered an improvement due to the continuous utilization of controllers for the video games. This continuous process helps to train the users to overcome their condition which impedes in their abilities of interpretation. The ability of hand-eye coordination is also improved thanks in part to video games, due to the need to operate the controller and view the screen displaying the content all at the same time. The coordination of the player is enhanced due to the playing and continuous observation of a video game since the game gives high mental stimulation and coordination is important and therefore enhanced due to the constant visual and physical movement that is produced from the playing of the video game.

The playing of video games can also help increase a player&#x27;s social skills. This is done by playing online multiplayer games which can require constant communication, this leads to socialization between players in order to achieve the goal within the game they may be playing. In addition it can help the users to meet new friends over their online games and at the same time communicate with friends they have already made in the past; those playing together online would only strengthen their already established bond through constant cooperation. Some video games are specifically designed to aid in learning, because of this another benefit of playing video games could be the educational value provided with the entertainment. Some video games present problem solving questions that the player must think on in order to properly solve, while action orientated video games require strategy in order to successfully complete. This process of being forced to think critically helps to sharpen the mind of the player.

=== Game culture ===

One aspect of game studies is the study of gaming culture. People who play video games are a subculture of their own. Gamers will often form communities with their own languages, attend conventions where they will dress up as their favorite characters, and have gaming competitions. One of these conventions, Gamescom 2018, had a record attendance with an estimated 370,000 attendees.

Esports are making a significant impact in gaming culture. In 2018, Newzoo, a marketing analytics company reported that 380 million people will watch esports that year. Many gamers seek to form communities to meet new people and share their love of games. In 2014, Newzoo reported that 81% of gamers attend esport to be a part of the gaming community. &quot;61% of gamers attend live events and tournaments to connect with friends that they&#x27;ve met and played with online.&quot;

Throughout the years, there has been much research on the topic of game culture, specifically focusing on video games in relation to thinking, learning, gender, children, and war. When looking at game culture, particularly for early studies, multiplayer online games were usually the basis for research. However, more recent and wider ranging research has sought to understand not just gaming cultures, but in turn, how video games provide important insights into the modern nature of digital and participatory culture, patterns of consumption and identity formation, later modernity and contemporary political rationalities.

<doc id="402120" wikidata="Q464122" url="?curid=402120" title="Coronation of the British monarch">
<text>The coronation of the monarch of the United Kingdom is an initiation ceremony in which they are formally invested with regalia and crowned at Westminster Abbey. It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in other European monarchies, which have all abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies. A coronation is a symbolic formality and does not signify the official beginning of the monarch&#x27;s reign; &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; his or her reign commences from the moment of the preceding monarch&#x27;s death or abdication, maintaining legal continuity of the monarchy.

The coronation usually takes place several months after the death of the monarch&#x27;s predecessor, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives planners enough time to complete the required elaborate arrangements. The most recent coronation took place on 6 May 2023 to crown King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

The ceremony is performed by the archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior cleric in the Church of England, of which the monarch is supreme governor. Other clergy and members of the British nobility traditionally have roles as well. Most participants wear ceremonial uniforms or robes, and before the most recent coronation, some wore coronets. Many government officials and guests attend, including representatives of other countries.

The essential elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past 1,000 years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. The sovereign then swears an oath to uphold the law and the Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of their subjects. Consorts of kings are then anointed and crowned as queens. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to greet crowds and watch a flypast.

==History==
===English coronations===

English coronations were traditionally held at Westminster Abbey, with the monarch seated on the Coronation Chair. Main elements of the coronation service and the earliest form of oath can be traced to the ceremony devised by Saint Dunstan for King Edgar&#x27;s coronation in 973 AD at Bath Abbey. It drew on ceremonies used by the kings of the Franks and those used in the ordination of bishops. Two versions of coronation services, known as &quot;ordines&quot; (from the Latin &quot;ordo&quot; meaning &quot;order&quot;) or s, survive from before the Norman Conquest. It is not known if the first recension was ever used in England, and it was the second recension which was used by Edgar in 973 and by subsequent Anglo-Saxon and early Norman kings.

A third recension was probably compiled during the reign of Henry I and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it may have borrowed from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the &quot;Pontificale Romano-Germanicum&quot;, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice. It remained in use until the coronation of Edward II in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new &quot;ordo&quot; focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings. One manuscript of this recension is the &quot;Liber Regalis&quot; at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.

Following the start of the Reformation in England, the boy king Edward VI had been crowned in the first Protestant coronation in 1547, during which Archbishop Thomas Cranmer preached a sermon against idolatry and &quot;the tyranny of the bishops of Rome&quot;. However, six years later, he was succeeded by his half-sister Mary I, who restored the Catholic rite. In 1559, Elizabeth I underwent the last English coronation under the auspices of the Catholic Church; however, Elizabeth&#x27;s insistence on changes to reflect her Protestant beliefs resulted in several bishops refusing to officiate at the service, and it was conducted by the low-ranking bishop of Carlisle, Owen Oglethorpe.

===Scottish coronations===

Scottish coronations were traditionally held at Scone Abbey in Perthshire, with the monarch seated on the Stone of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown does not seem to have been used until the inauguration of Alexander II in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king&#x27;s genealogy. The Bishop of St Andrews (from 1472 an archbishop) usually presided, but other bishops and archbishops also performed at some coronations.

After the coronation of John Balliol, the Stone was taken to Westminster Abbey in 1296 and in 1300–1301 Edward I of England had it incorporated into the English Coronation Chair. Its first certain use at an English coronation was that of Henry IV in 1399. Pope John XXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant James V at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of St Andrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that the child would have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.

James VI had been crowned in the Church of the Holy Rude at Stirling in 1567. After the Union of the Crowns, he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 25 July 1603. His son Charles I travelled north for a Scottish coronation at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh in 1633, but caused consternation amongst the Presbyterian Scots by his insistence on elaborate High Anglican ritual, arousing &quot;gryt feir of inbriginge of poperie&quot;. Charles II underwent a simple Presbyterian coronation ceremony at Scone in 1651, but his brother James VII and II was never crowned in Scotland, although Scottish peers attended his 1685 coronation in London, setting a precedent for future ceremonies. The coronation of Charles II was the last to take place in Scotland, and no bishop presided as the episcopacy had been abolished; the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government, Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, crowned Charles instead.

===Modern coronations===

The &quot;Liber Regalis&quot; was translated into English for the first time for the coronation of James I in 1603, partly as a result of the reformation in England requiring services to be understood by the people, but also an attempt by antiquarians to recover a lost English identity from before the Norman Conquest. In 1685, James II, who was a Catholic, ordered a truncated version of the service omitting the Eucharist, but this was restored for later monarchs. Only four years later, the service was again revised by Henry Compton for the coronation of William III and Mary II. The Latin text was resurrected for the 1714 coronation of the German-speaking George I, since it was the only common language between the king and the clergy. Perhaps because the 1761 coronation of George III had been beset by &quot;numerous mistakes and stupidities&quot;, the next time around, spectacle overshadowed the religious aspect of the service. The coronation of George IV in 1821 was an expensive and lavish affair with a vast amount of money being spent on it.

George&#x27;s brother and successor William IV had to be persuaded to be crowned at all; his coronation at a time of economic depression in 1831 cost only one sixth of that spent on the previous event. Traditionalists threatened to boycott what they called a &quot;Half Crown-nation&quot;. The king merely wore his robes over his uniform as Admiral of the Fleet. For this coronation, a number of economising measures were made which would set a precedent followed by future monarchs. The assembly of peers and ceremonial at Westminster Hall involving the presentation of the regalia to the monarch was eliminated. The procession from Westminster Hall to the Abbey on foot was likewise eliminated and in its place, a state procession by coach from St James&#x27;s Palace to the abbey was instituted, an important feature of the modern event. The coronation banquet after the service proper was also terminated.

When Victoria was crowned in 1838, the service followed the pared-down precedent set by her uncle, and the under-rehearsed ceremonial, again presided over by William Howley, was marred by mistakes and accidents. The music in the abbey was widely criticised in the press, only one new piece having been written for it, and the large choir and orchestra were badly coordinated.

In the 20th century, liturgical scholars sought to restore the spiritual meaning of the ceremony by rearranging elements with reference to the medieval texts, creating a &quot;complex marriage of innovation and tradition&quot;. The greatly increased pageantry of the state processions was intended to emphasise the strength and diversity of the British Empire.

===Bringing coronations to the people===

The idea of the need to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the ceremony a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of Richard II who was a 10-year-old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the City of London by the lord mayor, aldermen and the livery companies, and he was conducted to the Tower of London where he spent the night in vigil. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the public conduits flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in Cheapside, probably to represent the New Jerusalem, where a girl blew gold leaf over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of Charles II in 1661. Charles&#x27;s pageant was watched by Samuel Pepys who wrote: &quot;So glorious was the show with gold and silver that we were not able to look at it&quot;. James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queen and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from Westminster Hall to the abbey. For the coronation of William IV and Adelaide in 1831, a state procession from St James&#x27;s Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.

In early modern coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually recorded by artists and published in elaborate folio books of engravings, the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier. Re-enactments of the ceremony were staged at London and provincial theatres; in 1761, a production featuring the Westminster Abbey choir at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden ran for three months after the real event. In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a gramophone record was rejected, but Sir Benjamin Stone photographed the procession into the abbey. Nine years later, at the coronation of George V, Stone was allowed to photograph the recognition, the presentation of the swords, and the homage.

The coronation of George VI in 1937 was broadcast on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and parts of the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the Queen. It is estimated that over 20 million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.

===Commonwealth realms===
The need to include the various elements of the British Empire in coronations was not considered until 1902, when it was attended by the prime ministers and governors-general of the British Dominions, by then almost completely autonomous, and also by many of the rulers of the Indian Princely States and the various British Protectorates. An Imperial Conference was held afterwards. In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions, India and the Home Nations. By 1937, the Statute of Westminster 1931 had made the dominions fully independent, and the wording of the coronation oath was amended to include their names and confine the elements concerning religion to the United Kingdom.

Thus since 1937, the monarch has been simultaneously crowned as sovereign of several independent nations besides the United Kingdom, known since 1953 as the Commonwealth realms. Elizabeth II was asked, for example: &quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?&quot; In 2023, the oath was amended to avoid reciting the realms other than the United Kingdom during the coronation of Charles III.

==Preparations==
===Timing===
The timing of the coronation has varied throughout British history. King Edgar&#x27;s coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 959 and may have been intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised. Harold II was crowned on the day after the death of his predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold&#x27;s succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, William I, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25 December 1066, but three weeks since the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. Edward I was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. Edward II&#x27;s coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. Henry VI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar&#x27;s coronation was at Pentecost, William I&#x27;s on Christmas Day, possibly in imitation of the Byzantine emperors, and John&#x27;s was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George&#x27;s Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.

Under the Hanoverian monarchs in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was deemed appropriate to extend the waiting period to several months, following a period of mourning for the previous monarch and to allow time for preparation of the ceremony.
In the case of every monarch between George IV and George V, at least one year passed between accession and coronation. Edward VIII was not crowned and his successor George VI was crowned 5 months after his accession. The coronation date of his predecessor had already been set; planning simply continued with a new monarch. The coronation of Charles III and Camilla was held on 6 May 2023, eight months after he acceded to the throne.

Since a period of time has often passed between accession and coronation, some monarchs were never crowned. Edward V and Lady Jane Grey were both deposed before they could be crowned, in 1483 and 1553, respectively. Edward VIII also went uncrowned, as he abdicated in 1936 before the end of the customary one-year period between accession and coronation. A monarch, however, accedes to the throne the moment their predecessor dies, not when they are crowned, hence the traditional proclamation: &quot;The king is dead, long live the king!&quot;

===Location===
The Anglo-Saxon monarchs used various locations for their coronations, including Bath, Kingston upon Thames, London, and Winchester. The last Anglo-Saxon monarch, Harold II, was crowned at Westminster Abbey in 1066; the location was preserved for all future coronations. When London was under the control of rebels, Henry III was crowned at Gloucester in 1216; he later chose to have a second coronation at Westminster in 1220. Two hundred years later, Henry VI also had two coronations; as king of England in London in 1429, and as king of France in Paris in 1431.

===Coronation of consorts and others===

Coronations may be performed for a person other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father Henry II; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this is only one of two instances of its kind in England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king&#x27;s wife is crowned as queen consort. If the king is already married at the time of his coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may be performed. The first such coronation was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; eighteen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and Mary II. The most recent was that of Charles III and his wife Camilla in 2023. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife was not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn&#x27;s in 1533. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, Charles II, did not have a separate coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza. In some instances, the king&#x27;s wife was simply unable to join him in the coronation ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV&#x27;s estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was not invited to the ceremony; when she showed up at Westminster Abbey anyway, she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657.

==Participants==

===Clergy===

The Archbishop of Canterbury, who has precedence over all other clergy and all laypersons except members of the royal family, traditionally officiates at coronations; in his absence, another bishop appointed by the monarch may take the archbishop&#x27;s place. There have, however, been several exceptions. William I was crowned by the Archbishop of York, since the Archbishop of Canterbury had been appointed by the Antipope Benedict X, and this appointment was not recognised as valid by the Pope. Edward II was crowned by the Bishop of Winchester because the Archbishop of Canterbury had been exiled by Edward I. Mary I, a Catholic, refused to be crowned by the Protestant Archbishop Thomas Cranmer; the coronation was instead performed by the Bishop of Winchester. Elizabeth I was crowned by the Bishop of Carlisle (to whose see is attached no special precedence) because the senior prelates were &quot;either dead, too old and infirm, unacceptable to the queen, or unwilling to serve&quot;. Finally, when James II was deposed and replaced with William III and Mary II jointly, the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to recognise the new sovereigns; he had to be replaced by the Bishop of London, Henry Compton. Hence, in almost all cases where the Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to participate, his place has been taken by a senior cleric: the Archbishop of York is second in precedence, the Bishop of London third, the Bishop of Durham fourth, and the Bishop of Winchester fifth.

===Bishops Assistant===
From the moment they enter the Abbey until the moment they leave, the monarch is flanked by two supporting bishops of the Church of England. The part played by two supporting bishops dates back to the coronation of Edgar in 973: two bishops led him by hand into Bath Abbey. Since the coronation of Richard I in 1189, the Bishops of Bath &amp; Wells and Durham have assumed this duty.&lt;br&gt;Custom has it that they accompany the monarch throughout the ceremony, flanking them as they process from the entrance of Westminster Abbey and standing either side of St Edward&#x27;s Chair during the anointing. Bishops Assistant may also carry the Bible, paten, and chalice in the procession.
The Bishop of Durham stands on the monarch&#x27;s right and the Bishop of Bath and Wells on their left.
During the Coronation of King Charles III, Queen Camilla was similarly accompanied by Bishops Assistant – the Bishops of Hereford and of Norwich – on her right and left respectively.

===Great Officers of State===
The Great Officers of State traditionally participate during the ceremony. The offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable have not been regularly filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, revived for coronation ceremonies. The Lord Great Chamberlain enrobes the sovereign with the ceremonial vestments, with the aid of the Groom of the Robes and the Master (in the case of a king) or Mistress (in the case of a queen) of the Robes.

The Barons of the Cinque Ports also participated in the ceremony. Formerly, the barons were the members of the House of Commons representing the Cinque Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the 19th century, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, barons were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the barons were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey. The last time the barons performed such a task was at the coronation of George IV in 1821. The barons did not return for the coronations of William IV (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria&#x27;s, the barons have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies.

===Other claims to attend the coronation===

Many landowners and other persons have honorific &quot;duties&quot; or privileges at the coronation. Such rights have traditionally been determined by a special Court of Claims, over which the Lord High Steward traditionally presided. The first recorded Court of Claims was convened in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II. By the Tudor period, the hereditary post of Lord High Steward had merged with the Crown, and so Henry VIII began the modern tradition of naming a temporary Steward for the coronation only, with separate commissioners to carry out the actual work of the court.

In 1952, for example, the court accepted the claim of the Dean of Westminster to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand on either side of her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the Earl of Shrewsbury in his capacity as Lord High Steward of Ireland to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the Scholars of Westminster School to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of &quot;Vivat! Vivat Rex!&quot; were still incorporated into the coronation anthem &quot;I was glad&quot;.

For the 2023 coronation of Charles III and Camilla, a Coronation Claims Office within the Cabinet Office was established instead of the court.

===Other participants and guests===
Along with persons of nobility, the coronation ceremonies are also attended by a wide range of political figures, including the prime minister and all members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, all governors-general and prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms, all governors of British Crown Colonies (now British Overseas Territories), as well as the heads of state of dependent nations. Hereditary peers and their spouses are also invited. For Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953, 8,000 guests were squeezed into Westminster Abbey and each person had to make do with a maximum of of seating.

Dignitaries and representatives from other nations are also customarily invited. Traditionally, foreign crowned monarchs and consorts did not attend the coronations of others and were instead represented by other royals. In 1953, Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor (formerly Edward VIII), was not invited to the coronation of Elizabeth II, with the reason given that it was contrary to precedent for a sovereign or former sovereign to attend any coronation of another. The coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023 broke with that precedent and 16 foreign monarchs attended. English and British queens dowager also did not traditionally attend coronations until Queen Mary broke precedent by attending the 1937 coronation of her son, George VI.

==Service==
The general framework of the coronation service is based on the sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar. Although the service has undergone two major revisions and a translation, and has been modified for each coronation for the following thousand years, the sequence of taking an oath, anointing, investing of regalia, crowning and enthronement found in the Anglo-Saxon text have remained constant. The coronation ceremonies takes place within the framework of Holy Communion.

=== Recognition and oath ===
Before the entrance of the sovereign, the litany of the saints is sung during the procession of the clergy and other dignitaries. For the entrance of the monarch, an anthem from Psalm 122, &quot;I was glad&quot;, is sung.

The sovereign enters Westminster Abbey wearing the &quot;crimson surcoat&quot; and the &quot;Robe of State of crimson velvet&quot; and takes their seat on a Chair of Estate. Garter Principal King of Arms, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Constable and the Earl Marshal go to the east, south, west and north of the coronation theatre. At each side, the archbishop calls for the recognition of the sovereign, with the words:

After the people acclaim the sovereign at each side, the archbishop administers an oath to the sovereign. Since the Glorious Revolution, the Coronation Oath Act 1688 has required, among other things, that the sovereign &quot;Promise and Sweare to Governe the People of this Kingdome of England and the Dominions thereto belonging according to the Statutes in Parlyament Agreed on and the Laws and Customs of the same&quot;. The oath has been modified without statutory authority; for example, at the coronation of Elizabeth II, the exchange between the Queen and the archbishop was as follows:

In addition to the oath, the monarch may take what is known as the Accession Declaration if they have not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch&#x27;s accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at their coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.

Once the taking of the oath concludes, an ecclesiastic presents a Bible to the sovereign, saying &quot;Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God.&quot; The Bible used is a full King James Bible, including the Apocrypha. At Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation, the Bible was presented by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Once the Bible is presented, the Holy Communion is celebrated, with a special Collect for the coronation, but the service is interrupted after the Nicene Creed. At the coronation of Elizabeth II, the Epistle was , which instructs readers to respect and obey civil government, and the Gospel was , which contains Jesus&#x27;s famous instruction to &quot;render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar&#x27;s&quot;.

===Anointing===

After the Communion service is interrupted, the anthem &quot;Come, Holy Ghost&quot; is recited, as a prelude to the act of anointing. After this anthem, the Archbishop recites a prayer in preparation for the anointing, which is based on the ancient prayer &quot;Deus electorum fortitudo&quot; also used in the anointing of French kings. After this prayer, the coronation anthem &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; (by George Frederick Handel) is sung by the choir; meanwhile, the &quot;crimson robe&quot; is removed, and the sovereign proceeds to the Coronation Chair for the anointing, which has been set in a prominent position, wearing the &quot;anointing gown&quot;. In 1953, the chair stood atop a dais of several steps. This mediaeval chair has a cavity in the base into which the Stone of Scone is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as the &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot;, it was used for ancient Scottish coronations until brought to England by Edward I. It has been used for every coronation at Westminster Abbey since. Until 1996, the stone was kept with the chair in Westminster Abbey, but it was moved that year to Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, where it is displayed on the proviso that it be returned to Westminster Abbey for use at future coronations. It was announced by the First Minister in 2020 that the Stone will be relocated to Perth City Hall in 2024.

Once seated in this chair, a canopy of golden cloth was in the past held over the monarch&#x27;s head for the anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was performed in recent coronations by four Knights of the Garter. This element of the coronation service is considered sacred and is concealed from public gaze; it has never been photographed or televised. The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a filigreed spoon with which the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign in the form of a cross on the hands, head, and heart. The Coronation Spoon is the only part of the medieval Crown Jewels which survived the Commonwealth of England. While performing the anointing, the Archbishop recites a consecratory formula recalling the anointing of King Solomon by Nathan the prophet and Zadok the priest.

After being anointed, the monarch rises from the Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool placed in front of it. The archbishop then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is a modified English translation of the ancient Latin prayer &quot;Deus, Dei Filius&quot;, which dates back to the Anglo-Saxon second recension. Once this prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. At this point in 2023 the screen was removed.

===Investing===
The sovereign is then enrobed in the &quot;colobium sindonis&quot; (shroud tunic), over which is placed the &quot;supertunica&quot;.

The Lord Great Chamberlain presents the spurs, which represent chivalry. The Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by other bishops, then presents the Sword of State to the sovereign, who places it on the altar. The sovereign is then further robed, this time receiving bracelets and putting the &quot;Robe Royal&quot; and &quot;Stole Royal&quot; on top of the &quot;supertunica&quot;. The Archbishop then delivers several Crown Jewels to the sovereign. First, he delivers the Orb, a hollow gold sphere decorated with precious and semi-precious stones. The Orb is surmounted by a cross, representing the dominion of the divine over the world; it is returned to the altar immediately after being received. Next, the sovereign receives a ring representing their &quot;marriage&quot; to their territories, their subjects, and the divine. The Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Dove, so called because it is surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Ghost, and the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross, which incorporates Cullinan I, are delivered to the sovereign.

===Crowning===

The Archbishop of Canterbury lifts St Edward&#x27;s Crown from the high altar, sets it back down, and says a prayer: &quot;Oh God, the crown of the faithful; bless we beseech thee and sanctify this thy servant our king/queen, and as thou dost this day set a crown of pure gold upon his/her head, so enrich his/her royal heart with thine abundant grace, and crown him/her with all princely virtues through the King Eternal Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen&quot;. This prayer is the translation of the ancient formula &quot;Deus tuorum Corona fidelium&quot;, which first appeared in the twelfth-century third recension.

The Dean of Westminster picks up the crown and he, the archbishop and several other high-ranking bishops proceed to the Coronation Chair where the crown is handed back to the archbishop, who reverently places it on the monarch&#x27;s head. At this moment, the king or queen is crowned, and the guests in the abbey cry in unison three times, &quot;God Save the King/Queen&quot;. The trumpeters sound a fanfare and church bells ring out across the kingdom, as gun salutes echo from the Tower of London and Hyde Park.

Finally, the archbishop, standing before the monarch, says the crowning formula, which is a translation of the ancient Latin prayer &quot;Coronet te Deus&quot;: &quot;God crown you with a crown of glory and righteousness, that having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works, you may obtain the crown of an everlasting kingdom by the gift of him whose kingdom endureth for ever.&quot; To this the guests, with heads bowed, say &quot;Amen&quot;.

When this prayer is finished, the choir sings an English translation of the traditional Latin antiphon &quot;Confortare&quot;: &quot;Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways&quot;. During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon is followed by a rite of benediction consisting of several prayers, after each one the congregation replies with &quot;a loud and hearty Amen&quot;.

===Enthronement and homage===
The benediction being concluded, the sovereign rises from the Coronation Chair and is borne into a throne. Once the monarch is seated on the throne, the formula &quot;Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth...&quot; is recited; a translation of the Latin formula &quot;Sta et retine...&quot;, which was first used in England in the tenth-century second recension, and also appeared in French, German and imperial coronation texts.

After the enthronement proper, the act of homage takes place: the archbishops and bishops swear their fealty, saying &quot;I, N., Archbishop [Bishop] of N., will be faithful and true, and faith and truth will bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord [Lady], King [Queen] of this Realm and Defender of the Faith, and unto your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.&quot; In the past peers then proceeded to pay their homage, saying &quot;I, N., Duke [Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron or Lord] of N., do become your liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and faith and truth will I bear unto you, to live and die, against all manner of folks. So help me God.&quot; The clergy pay homage together, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Next, members of the royal family pay homage individually. The peers were then led by the premier peers of their rank: the dukes by the premier duke, the marquesses by the premier marquess, and so forth. In the shortened coronation of Charles III and Camilla, the paying of homage by the peerage was omitted.

If there is a queen consort, she is anointed, invested, crowned and enthroned in a simple ceremony immediately after homage is paid. The Communion service interrupted earlier is resumed and completed, but with special prayers: there are prayers for the monarch and consort at the Offertory and a special preface. Finally, the monarch and consort receive Communion, the &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot; is sung and the blessing is given.
===Closing procession===
The sovereign then exits the coronation theatre, entering St Edward&#x27;s Chapel (within the abbey), preceded by the bearers of the Sword of State, the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice and the blunt Sword of Mercy. While the monarch is in St. Edward&#x27;s chapel, the choir recites an English translation of the hymn of thanksgiving &quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot;. St Edward&#x27;s Crown and all the other regalia are laid on the High Altar of the chapel; the sovereign removes the &quot;Robe Royal&quot; and &quot;Stole Royal&quot;, exchanges the &quot;crimson surcoat&quot; for the &quot;purple surcoat&quot; and is enrobed in the &quot;Imperial Robe of purple velvet&quot;. The sovereign then dons the Imperial State Crown and takes into their hands the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb and leaves the chapel first while all present sing the national anthem.

==Music==

The music played at coronations has been primarily classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible which have been used at coronations since King Edgar&#x27;s coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King&#x27;s Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for George II&#x27;s coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of Charles II and Thomas Tomkins for Charles I in 1621.

In the 19th century, works by major European composers were often used, but when Sir Frederick Bridge was appointed director of music for the 1902 coronation of Edward VII, he decided that it ought to be a celebration of four hundred years of British music. Compositions by Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell were included alongside works by contemporary composers such as Arthur Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and John Stainer. Hubert Parry&#x27;s &quot;I was glad&quot; was written as the entrance anthem for the 1902 coronation, replacing an 1831 setting by Thomas Attwood; it contains a bridge section partway through so that the scholars of Westminster School can exercise their right to be the first commoners to acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional &quot;vivats&quot; as the sovereign enters the coronation theatre. This anthem and Charles Villiers Stanford&#x27;s &quot;Gloria in excelsis&quot; (1911) have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the national anthem, &quot;God Save the King&quot; (or Queen). Other composers whose music featured in Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation include Sir George Dyson, Gordon Jacob, Sir William Henry Harris, Herbert Howells, Sir William Walton, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Ralph Vaughan Williams and the Canadian-resident but English-born Healey Willan. Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn be included. This was approved by the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan Williams recast his 1928 arrangement of &quot;Old 100th&quot;, the English metrical version of Psalm 100, the &quot;Jubilate Deo&quot; (&quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot;) for congregation, organ and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the Anglophone world.

==Dress==
Several participants in the ceremony wear special costumes, uniforms or robes. For those in attendance (other than members of the royal family) what to wear is laid down in detail by the Earl Marshal prior to each Coronation and published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

=== Sovereign&#x27;s robes ===
The sovereign wears a variety of robes and other garments during the course of the ceremony. In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the regalia, it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch. (The present exceptions are the &quot;supertunica&quot; and &quot;Robe Royal&quot;, which both date from the coronation of George IV in 1821.)

Worn for the first part of the service (and the processions beforehand):
* &quot;Crimson surcoat&quot; – the regular dress during most of the ceremony, worn under all other robes. In 1953, Elizabeth II wore a newly made gown in place of a surcoat.
* &quot;Robe of State of crimson velvet&quot; or &quot;Parliament Robe&quot; – the first robe used at a coronation, worn on entry to the abbey and later at State Openings of Parliament. It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined with further ermine and decorated with gold lace.

Worn over the surcoat for the Anointing:
* &quot;Anointing gown&quot; – a simple and austere garment worn during the anointing. It is plain white, bears no decoration and fastens at the back.

Robes with which the Sovereign is invested (worn thereafter until Communion):
* &quot;Colobium sindonis&quot; (&quot;shroud tunic&quot;) – the first robe with which the sovereign is invested. It is a loose white undergarment of fine linen cloth edged with a lace border, open at the sides, sleeveless and cut low at the neck. It symbolises the derivation of royal authority from the people.
* &quot;Supertunica&quot; – the second robe with which the sovereign is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.
* &quot;Robe Royal&quot; or &quot;Pallium Regale&quot; – the main robe worn during the ceremony and used during the crowning. It is a four-square mantle, lined in crimson silk and decorated with silver coronets, national symbols and silver imperial eagles in the four corners. It is lay, rather than liturgical, in nature.
* &quot;Stole Royal&quot; or &quot;armilla&quot; – a gold silk stole or scarf which accompanies the Robe Royal, richly and heavily embroidered with gold and silver thread, set with jewels and lined with rose-coloured silk and gold fringing.

Worn for the final part of the service (and the processions which follow):
* &quot;Purple surcoat&quot; – the counterpart to the crimson surcoat, worn during the final part of the ceremony.
* &quot;Imperial Robe of purple velvet&quot; – the robe worn at the conclusion of the ceremony, on exit from the abbey. It comprises an embroidered ermine cape with a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian ermine and fully lined with pure silk English satin. The purple recalls the imperial robes of Roman Emperors.

====Headwear====
Male sovereigns up to and including George VI have traditionally worn a crimson cap of maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during the first part of the service. Charles III arrived at his coronation bareheaded in 2023, rather than with the cap. Female sovereigns (and some female consorts) have traditionally worn the George IV State Diadem, first worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward&#x27;s Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns as it weighs 2.23 kg (4.9 lb). For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown.

===Other members of the royal family===
Certain other members of the royal family wear distinctive robes, most particularly queens consort (including dowagers) and princesses of the United Kingdom, all of whom wear purple velvet mantles edged with ermine over their court dresses. Other members of the royal family in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that royal dukes wear a distinctive form of peer&#x27;s robe, which has six rows of ermine on the cape and additional ermine on miniver edging to the front of the robe.

====Headwear====
Queens consort in the 20th century arrived at their coronation bareheaded, and remained so until the point in the service when they were crowned with their own crown. In the late 17th century and 18th century, queens consort wore Mary of Modena&#x27;s State Diadem. Prior to the 20th century it was not usual for dowager queens to attend coronations, but Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother both attended the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II respectively, and each wore the crown, minus its arches, with which she had been crowned for the duration of the service.

Traditionally, princesses and princes of the United Kingdom were provided with distinctive forms of coronet, which they wore during the service. A male heir-apparent&#x27;s coronet displays four crosses-pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children and siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-pattée and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-pattée and four strawberry leaves, is used for the children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The tradition of coronets was abolished for the 2023 coronation, and members of the royal family dressed in robes of one of their orders of chivalry.

===Peers===

All peers and peeresses in attendance are &quot;expected to wear&quot; Robes of State, as described below. These robes are different to the Parliament Robe (worn on occasion by peers who are members of the House of Lords); all peers summoned to attend wear the Robe of State, regardless of membership of the House of Lords, and peeresses&#x27; robes are worn not only by women who are peers in their own right, but also by wives and widows of peers. Those entitled to a collar of an order of knighthood wear it over (and attached to) the cape.

====Peers&#x27; robes====
A peer&#x27;s coronation robe is a full-length cloak-type garment of crimson velvet, edged down the front with miniver pure, with a full cape (also of miniver pure) attached. On the cape, rows of &quot;ermine tails (or the like)&quot; indicate the peer&#x27;s rank: dukes have four rows, marquesses three and a half, earls three, viscounts two and a half, and barons and lords of parliament two.

Prior to the 19th century peers also wore a matching crimson surcoat edged in miniver.

In 1953, &quot;Peers taking part in the Processions or Ceremonies in Westminster Abbey&quot; were directed to wear the Robe of State over full-dress uniform (Naval, Military, RAF or civil), if so entitled, or else over full velvet court dress (or one of the alternative styles of Court Dress, as laid down in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s regulations). Other peers in attendance were &quot;expected to wear the same if possible&quot;; but the wearing of evening dress, or a black suit with white bow tie, were also permitted (as was the use of a Parliament Robe or a mantle of one of the Orders of Knighthood by those not taking part in the Processions or Ceremonies).

====Peeresses&#x27; robes====

A peeress&#x27;s coronation robe is described as a long (trained) crimson velvet mantle, edged all round with miniver pure and having a cape of miniver pure (with rows of ermine indicating the rank of the wearer, as for peers). Furthermore, the length of the train (and the width of the miniver edging) varies with the rank of the wearer: for duchesses, the trains are 1.8 m (2 yds) long, for marchionesses one and three-quarters yards, for countesses one and a half yards, for viscountesses one and a quarter yards, and for baronesses and ladies 90 cm (1 yd). The edgings are 13 cm (5 in) in width for duchesses, 10 cm (4 in) for marchionesses, 7.5 cm (3 in) for countesses and 5 cm (2 in) for viscountesses, baronesses and ladies.

This Robe of State is directed to be worn with a sleeved crimson velvet kirtle, which is similarly edged with miniver and worn over a full-length white or cream court dress (without a train).

====Headwear====
During the Coronation, peers and peeresses formerly put on coronets. Like their robes, their coronets are differentiated according to rank: the coronet of a duke or duchess is ornamented with eight strawberry leaves, that of a marquess or marchioness has four strawberry leaves alternating with four raised silver balls, that of an earl or countess eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight raised silver balls, that of a viscount or viscountess has sixteen smaller silver balls and that of a baron or baroness six silver balls. Peeresses&#x27; coronets are identical to those of peers, but smaller. In addition, peeresses were told in 1953 that &quot;a tiara should be worn, if possible&quot;. The use of coronets was abolished for the 2023 coronation.

===Others===
In 1953, those taking part in the Procession inside the Abbey who were not peers or peeresses were directed to wear full-dress (naval, military, air force or civil) uniform, or one of the forms of court dress laid down in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Regulations for Dress at Court. These regulations, as well as providing guidance for members of the public, specify forms of dress for a wide variety of office-holders and public officials, clergy, the judiciary, members of the Royal Household, etc. It also includes provision for Scottish dress to be worn.

Officers in the Armed Forces and the Civil, Foreign, and Colonial Services who did not take part in the Procession wore uniform, and male civilians: &quot;one of the forms of court dress as laid down in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Regulations for Dress at Court, or evening dress with knee breeches or trousers, or morning dress, or dark lounge suits&quot;.

Ladies attending in 1953 were instructed to wear &quot;evening dresses or afternoon dresses, with a light veiling falling from the back of the head&quot;. Coats and hats were not permitted but tiaras could be worn.

In 1953 an additional note made it clear that &quot;Oriental dress may be worn by Ladies and Gentlemen for whom it is the usual Ceremonial Costume&quot;.

==After-celebrations==
Since the 20th century it has been traditional for the newly crowned monarch and other members of the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, if there is one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, Edward VII&#x27;s illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.

Historically, the coronation was immediately followed by a banquet held in Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster (which is also the home to the Houses of Parliament). The King or Queen&#x27;s Champion (the office being held by the Dymoke family in connection with the Manor of Scrivelsby) would ride into the hall on horseback, wearing a knight&#x27;s armour, with the Lord High Constable riding to his right and the Earl Marshal riding to his left. A herald would then make a proclamation of the readiness of the champion to fight anyone denying the monarch. After 1800, the form for this was as follows:

The King&#x27;s Champion would then throw down the gauntlet; the ceremony would be repeated at the centre of the hall and at the High Table (where the sovereign would be seated). The sovereign would then drink to the champion from a gold cup, which he would then present to the latter. This ritual was dropped from the coronation of Queen Victoria and was never revived. The offices of Chief Butler of England, Grand Carver of England and Master Carver of Scotland were also associated with the coronation banquet.

Banquets have not been held at Westminster Hall since the coronation of George IV in 1821. His coronation was the most elaborate in history; his brother and successor William IV eliminated the banquet on grounds of economy, ending a 632-year-old tradition. Since 1901, a Coronation Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate the coronation, a coronation honours list is also released before the coronation.

==Enthronement as Emperor of India==

Queen Victoria assumed the title &quot;Empress of India&quot; in 1876. A durbar (court) was held in Delhi, India on 1 January 1877 to proclaim her assumption of the title. The queen did not attend personally, but she was represented there by the Viceroy, Lord Lytton. A similar durbar was held on 1 January 1903 to celebrate the accession of Edward VII, who was represented by his brother the Duke of Connaught. In 1911, George V also held a durbar which he and his wife Queen Mary attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for a Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian nation, George V was not crowned in India; instead, he wore an imperial crown as he entered the Durbar. Tradition prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the Imperial Crown of India, was created for him. The emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain political decisions, such as the decision to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, were announced at the durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by George VI in 1948, 10 months after India gained independence.

==Kings of Arms==
Aside from kings and queens, the only individuals authorised to wear crowns (as opposed to coronets) are the Kings of Arms, the United Kingdom&#x27;s senior heraldic officials. Like the peers&#x27; coronets, these crowns are only put on at the actual moment of the monarch&#x27;s crowning, after which they are worn for the rest of the service and its subsequent festivities. Garter, Clarenceaux, and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms have heraldic jurisdiction over England, Wales and Northern Ireland; Lord Lyon King of Arms is responsible for Scotland. In addition, there is a King of Arms attached to each of the Order of the Bath, Order of St. Michael and St. George and the Order of the British Empire. These have only a ceremonial role, but are authorised by the statutes of their orders to wear the same crown as Garter at a coronation. The crown of a King of Arms is silver-gilt and consists of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, and inscribed with the words &quot;Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam&quot; (Latin: &quot;Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy&quot;, from Psalm 51). The Lord Lyon King of Arms has worn a crown of this style at all coronations since that of George III. Prior to that he wore a replica of the Crown of Scotland. In 2004 a new replica of this crown was created for use by the Lord Lyon.

==Regional Bell Operating Companies==
The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) are the result of the break-up of the Bell System in 1984. After numerous mergers, asset sales, and renamings since the break-up, these are the current successor RBOCs:

*AT&amp;T: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin
*Verizon: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia
*Lumen Technologies: Bell System (RBOC) lines (from Qwest) in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.
*Frontier Communications: owns the ex-Bell System ILEC areas in Connecticut and West Virginia.
*Consolidated Communications operates ex-Bell exchanges in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, which it gained from its acquisition of FairPoint, which had acquired them from Verizon. 

=== Other major local exchange carriers ===
In the following states and regions, the primary local carrier (LEC) is not an RBOC:
* Lumen Technologies, in addition to its role as the BOC in the areas of 14 states gained from its acquisition of Qwest, Lumen serves other non-ex-Bell local exchanges in those states, as well as some in Florida and the Las Vegas metropolitan area in Nevada. 
* Brightspeed Communications was formed in 2022 when Lumen sold its landline operations in 20 states outside its core area (and Florida).
* Frontier Communications, in addition to its role as the BOC for West Virginia, now serves mainly rural and some suburban and smaller city areas in 27 other states (many formerly part of the GTE ILEC system purchased from Verizon) including parts of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.
* Windstream, founded in 2006 with the spinoff of Alltel&#x27;s wireline division and simultaneous merger with Valor Telecom, serves mainly rural areas in 29 states.
* Consolidated Communications, in addition to its RBOC functions in Northern New England, also serves rural areas in 22 states.
* Telephone and Data Systems, (through its subsidiary TDS) serves mainly rural areas in parts of 36 states.
* Altafiber, formerly known as Cincinnati Bell, which serves the Cincinnati metropolitan area, and Hawaii (due to its ownership of Hawaiian Telcom). It was not included in the Bell System breakup of 1984 because the original AT&amp;T held only a minority stake in that company.
* Verizon, in addition to its role as a RBOC in its areas retained in the East, serves former GTE areas in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Verizon formerly served ex-GTE areas in parts of California, Florida and Texas before selling to Frontier Communications in 2016. 
* Claro Puerto Rico, which serves every exchange in Puerto Rico, has been owned by the international telecommunications giant América Móvil since in 2007.
*Ziply Fiber, which serves ex-GTE areas in the Pacific Northwest that they bought from Frontier. 

Many other individual communities or smaller regions are also served by non-RBOC companies.

<text>Australian Light Horse were mounted troops with characteristics of both cavalry and mounted infantry, who served in the Second Boer War and World War I. During the inter-war years, a number of regiments were raised as part of Australia&#x27;s part-time military force. These units were gradually mechanised either before or during World War II, although only a small number undertook operational service during the war. A number of Australian light horse units are still in existence today.

==Origins==

The Australian Light Horse was established as the outcome of a debate that took place in military circles in Australia in the late 19th – early 20th centuries concerning the future of mounted troops. The example of the Franco-Prussian War illustrated that the battlefield had become dominated by massed land armies supported by artillery. For Australia the reality was vast spaces with sparse populations making it difficult to consider anything that remotely looked like the European model. The 1890s were wracked by drought and depression ensuring that none of the states were able to afford anything but the most token of armies supported by a large contingent of volunteers.
The Second Boer War provided the short term answer. While Australian forces fought against the Boers in South Africa, the Boer methodology of conducting war was considered to be the answer for Australian defence. Volunteer Light Horse Regiments were established around Australia supported by the Rifle Club movement which provided semi trained reinforcements for the various formations. Should these formations be called upon to defend Australia, the local commander was charged with maintaining resistance through the use of the Commando formation which envisaged a large scale guerrilla war. The prospect of an endless and strength-sapping guerrilla war was the key deterrent factor which relied heavily upon mobile soldiers. The mounted infantry remained the key to the Australian defence posture until the Kitchener Report of 1910 () which envisaged formations that could be slotted directly into an Imperial expeditionary force. The plan envisaged two mounted divisions.

By the outbreak of World War I, there were 23 light horse regiments within Australia&#x27;s part-time military force, consisting of 9,000 personnel. These were organised as follows:

* 1st Light Horse Brigade (Queensland): 1st (Central Queensland), 2nd (Queensland Mounted Infantry), 3rd (Darling Downs), 4th (Northern Rivers Lancers) and 27th (North Queensland) Light Horse Regiments
* 2nd Light Horse Brigade (New South Wales): 5th (New England) and 6th (Hunter River Lancers) Light Horse Regiments
* 3rd Light Horse Brigade (New South Wales): 7th (New South Wales Lancers), 9th (New South Wales Mounted Rifles), 11th (Australian Horse) and 28th (Illawarra) Light Horse Regiments
* 5th Light Horse Brigade (Victoria): 13th (Gippsland), 15th (Victorian Mounted Rifles), and 16th (Indi) Light Horse Regiments
* 7th Light Horse Brigade (Victoria): 17th (Campaspe), 19th (Yarrowee), 20th (Corangamite) and 29th (Port Phillip Horse) Light Horse Regiments
* 8th Light Horse Brigade (South Australia): 22nd (South Australian Mounted Rifles), 23rd (Barossa), and 24th (Flinders) Light Horse Regiments
* 25th (Western Australian Mounted Infantry) Light Horse Regiment
* 26th (Tasmanian Mounted Infantry) Light Horse Regiment
* Australian Commonwealth Horse 
** Eight battalions formed following federation (1 January 1901); only the 1st and 2nd Battalions saw action before the Second Boer War ended.

==World War I==

===Formation and organisation===

Light horse were like mounted infantry in that they usually fought dismounted, using their horses as transport to the battlefield and as a means of swift disengagement when retreating or retiring. A famous exception to this rule though was the charge of the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments at Beersheba on 31 October 1917. In 1918, some light horse regiments were equipped with sabres, enabling them to fight in a conventional cavalry role in the advance on Damascus. However, unlike mounted infantry, the light horse also performed certain cavalry roles, such as scouting and screening, while mounted.

The light horse were organised along cavalry rather than infantry lines. A light horse regiment, although technically equivalent to an infantry battalion in terms of command level, contained only 25 officers and 400 men as opposed to an infantry battalion that consisted of around 1,000 men. Around a quarter of this nominal strength (or one man in each section of four) could be allotted to horse-holding duties when the regiment entered combat. A regiment was divided into three squadrons, designated &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; (equivalent to a company), and a squadron divided into four troops (equivalent to but smaller than a platoon). Each troop was divided into about 10 four-man sections. When dismounting for combat, one man from each section would take the reins of the other three men&#x27;s horses and lead them out of the firing line where he would remain until called upon.

Each regiment initially had a troop of two Maxim guns but during the Gallipoli Campaign, where the light horse served dismounted, this was increased to four guns. In 1916, following the establishment of the Australian Machine Gun Corps, these were consolidated into four light horse machine gun squadrons, each with 12 Vickers machine guns, allocated at brigade level within the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades. In turn, the troops received the Lewis Gun. This was replaced by the Hotchkiss M1909 Benét–Mercié machine gun in April 1917. Eventually they arrived in such numbers as to allow each troop to have a Hotchkiss gun, which considerably added to the mobile firepower of a regiment.

The Australian Waler horse was the common mount for the light horsemen, as it was strong and hardy, which was needed in the harsh desert climate. This was facilitated by the horses being left behind in Egypt while the light horsemen went to Gallipoli, allowing them to gradually acclimatise.

Although the authorities did not welcome Indigenous men into the Australian Armed Forces, nonetheless some managed to enlist in the Australian Light Horse. Unlike in civilian life, where Indigenous men received a lower rate of pay, in the Army there was only one rate of pay. This may have been a motivation for their enlistment, in addition to other considerations, including patriotism. Several served during the Gallipoli campaign. Skilled in working with horses, and in hot climates, they were valued members of the Light Horse.

===Gallipoli and the Sinai and Palestine campaign===

At the start of World War I, Australia committed to provide an all volunteer expeditionary force of 20,000 personnel known as the Australian Imperial Force, which would consist of an infantry division and a light horse brigade. As Australia&#x27;s commitment to the war increased, the size of the light horse contingent was expanded, with a second and third light horse brigade being raised in late 1914 and early 1915. Eventually, the Australian Light Horse regiments were organised into five brigades:

*1st Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Light Horse Regiments.
*2nd Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 5th, 6th, 7th Light Horse Regiments.
*3rd Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 8th, 9th, 10th Light Horse Regiments.
*4th Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 4th, 11th, 12th Light Horse Regiments.
*5th Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments, in combination with the French 1er Regiment Mixte de Cavalerie du Levant and the New Zealand 2nd Machine Gun Squadron.

The light horse regiments&#x27; first involvement in the fighting during the war came during the Gallipoli Campaign, where the troops of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades were sent to Gallipoli without their horses to provide reinforcements for the infantry. During the campaign they were used mainly in a defensive role, although the light horsemen did participate in several costly battles, such as the Battle of the Nek. After the evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula in December 1915, the light horse regiments that had been deployed were re-constituted in Egypt and in March 1916, the Australian mounted troops of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade were placed together in the ANZAC Mounted Division.

Elements of the light horse brigades also undertook a campaign against the Senussi in the western desert region of Egypt with actions commencing in late 1915 and continuing through until 1917. These actions were largely limited though, and were overshadowed by the Light Horse&#x27;s involvement in the fighting against Ottoman forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918.

A reorganisation of the mounted troops was ordered in February 1917 leading to the formation of the Anzac Mounted Division consisting of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the British 22nd Mounted Brigade. Meanwhile, the Imperial Mounted Division was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British Yeomanry 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. The Imperial Mounted Division&#x27;s name was soon changed to the Australian Mounted Division at the request of the Australian government. The arrival of more yeomanry from Salonika prompted the raising of the Yeomanry Mounted Division (6th, 8th and 22nd Yeomanry Brigades) in June 1917. The three mounted divisions and the Imperial Camel Brigade formed the Desert Mounted Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel. With the removal of most of the Yeomanry to France and the breakup of the Imperial Camel Corps, the newly formed 5th Light Horse Brigade took its place with the Australian Mounted Division. Two Indian cavalry divisions replaced the Yeomanry Division in the Desert Mounted Corps.

====Care of horses in the Sinai campaign====
In 1916, the average loss of sick horses and mules from the Sinai front was approximately 640 per week. They were transported in train loads of thirty trucks, each holding eight horses. Animals which died or were destroyed while on active service were buried from the nearest camp unless this was not practicable. In this case the carcasses were transported to a suitable site away from troops, where they were disemboweled and left to disintegrate in the dry desert air and high temperatures. Animals which died or were destroyed in veterinary units at Kantara, Ismalia, Bilbeis, and Quesna were dealt with in this way and after four days&#x27; drying in the sun, the carcasses were stuffed with straw and burnt, after the skins were salved. These were sold to local contractors.

===Western Front===
The 13th Light Horse Regiment and one squadron of the 4th Light Horse Regiment served on the Western Front, first as divisional cavalry squadrons for the 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions, then as the I ANZAC Corps Mounted Regiment. A squadron of the 4th provided the divisional cavalry squadron for the 1st Division, and one of the 14th Light Horse Regiment for the 3rd Division. (This squadron was eventually disbanded.) The original B and D squadrons of the 4th, in combination with New Zealand mounted troops, became part of the II ANZAC Corps Mounted Regiment. After II Anzac Corps was disbanded, the regiment joined 22nd British Corps re-designated as XXII Anzac Mounted Regiment. After the Australian Corps was formed in November 1917, the I Anzac Corps Mounted Regiment became known as the 13th Light Horse Regiment again. The Australian squadrons of XXII Regiment were amalgamated with the 13th Australian Light Horse Regiment. For a month in 1918 during the battles of Hundred Days Offensive, the 13th was attached to the III British Corps, while Sir Alexander Godley briefly commanded III Corps and regarded the regiment as his personal troops.

==Post World War I==
After the war, the light horse regiments were distributed as follows:
* 1st Cavalry Brigade (Toowoomba, Queensland): 2nd, 5th, 11th, 14th Light Horse Regiments
* 2nd Cavalry Brigade (Maitland, New South Wales): 12th, 15th, 16th Light Horse Regiments
* 3rd Cavalry Brigade (Melbourne): 8th, 13th, 20th Light Horse Regiments
* 4th Cavalry Brigade (Paddington, New South Wales): 1st, 6th, 7th, 21st Light Horse Regiments
* 5th Cavalry Brigade (Melbourne) (disbanded 1936): 4th, 17th, 19th Light Horse Regiments
* 6th Cavalry Brigade (Adelaide): 3rd, 9th, 18th, 23rd Light Horse Regiments

These cavalry brigades were organised into two cavalry divisions: the 1st and 2nd.

At the outbreak of World War II, there were 25 light horse regiments. Of these, 17 were still horsed although they had been partially mechanised, while four had been converted to machine gun regiments and two had been converted to armoured car regiments. Throughout the war, the various light horse units were converted to motorised infantry, armoured car or armoured regiments, serving mainly in the defence of Australia. As the threat of invasion passed, though, most were disbanded in 1943 or 1944 and their personnel redistributed amongst other units. By 1945, only two units remained. The first of these was the 20th Light Horse Regiment, which as the 20th Motor Regiment, served overseas, at Merauke, and was later converted into a pioneer regiment. The second unit was the 1st Light Horse Regiment, which became the 1st Tank Battalion, and as such fought in New Guinea and Borneo.

==Legacy== 

* A number of Australian light horse units are still in existence today, generally as Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) cavalry units. Including the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles), 4th/19th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Light Horse, 10th Light Horse Regiment, and the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers.
* The Memorial to the Australian Light Horse at Tamworth was unveiled by Major General Digger James on 29 October 2005.
* The Australian Light Horse is commemorated by the Light Horse Interchange and sculptural installations along the M4 motorway where it is crossed by the M7 at Eastern Creek in Western Sydney.

* On 28 April 2008, Australia&#x27;s Governor-General Major General (ret) Michael Jeffery and Israeli President Shimon Peres unveiled a monument to the Light Horse in Beersheba, Israel. It was made by Australian sculptor Peter Corlett and was an initiative of the Melbourne-based Pratt Foundation in cooperation with the Beersheba City Council.
*On 31 October 2017, the Beersheba Anzac Memorial Centre was inaugurated in the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, New Zealand Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy and Beersheba Mayor Ruvik Danilovich. Also present were Peter Smaller, President of JNF Australia and Dan Springer, CEO of JNF Australia, which donated most of the funds to build the memorial centre. It stands within the grounds of the British war cemetery in Beersheba, and the building resembles a horse head, commemorating tens of thousands of horses that served and died throughout the war. It also holds a small collection of war remnants dated back to the British conquest of Palestine. The ANZAC Trail from the coast retraces the cavalry&#x27;s three-day path to the Battle of Beersheba.
*On 26 September 2019, a life-size sculpture, &#x27;The Aborigine and His Horse,&#x27; was dedicated at Tzemach, commemorating Aborigine ANZAC members, dubbed the &quot;Queensland Black Watch&quot;, including cavalrymen who fought at Tzemach and Be&#x27;er Sheva. Descendants of those horsemen travelled from Australia to participate in the statue&#x27;s inauguration, &quot;another stage in the historic correction that Australian society is undergoing in their relations with the Aborigines.&quot;
* On 11 November 1966, Sir Arthur Fadden (Australian Prime Minister in 1941) unveiled a statue of Sir William Glasgow created by Brisbane sculptor Daphne Mayo; Sir William Glasgow is depicted in the uniform of an officer of the Australian Light Horse. The statue was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2004 and was relocated to Post Office Square, Brisbane in 2008, adjacent to ANZAC Square, Brisbane.
* Commemorations of the Battle of Beersheba typically occur at the memorial in Canberra every year on 31 October, with bigger gatherings on the 5-year dates.
* In 1931, Dorothy Brooke, an Englishwoman living in Cairo, wrote a letter to a British newspaper, soliciting funds to euthanize the ageing army horses, who had been sold to the local Egyptians and were over 20 years old by then. She later established Brooke, an international animal welfare charity dedicated to improving the lives of working horses, donkeys and mules.
* Many of the descendants of the army horses are still in use today, carrying tourists around the pyramids of Giza in Cairo, and providing transport for local Egyptians 
* After Egyptian tourism collapsed following the Arab Spring in 2011, animal charities such as Brooke and Egypt Equine Aid stepped in to help with the care of the horses.
* Light Horse Memorial Park in Seymour, Victoria is on part of the site where the Australian Light Horse trained during World War I.

===Literature===
* &quot;The Wells of Beersheba&quot; (1933) by Frank Dalby Davison
* &quot;The Desert Column&quot; (1932) by Ion L. Idriess: the only known published account by a participant who was not an officer.
* &quot;As if He Knows&quot; (2001) – song by Eric Bogle reflecting the feelings of Light Horsemen farewelling their mounts in Egypt at the end of World War I. The narrator bitterly reflects that his horse &quot;who asked so little and gave so much&quot; will soon be dead. It was not possible to ship the animals back to Australia and most that could not be transferred to British or Indian army units were shot. Only a few hundred survived and were sold to Egyptians.

<text>In IBM PC compatible computing, DOS memory management refers to software and techniques employed to give applications access to more than 640 kibibytes (640*1024 bytes) (KiB) of &quot;conventional memory&quot;. The 640 KiB limit was specific to the IBM PC and close compatibles; other machines running MS-DOS had different limits, for example the Apricot PC could have up to 768 KiB and the Sirius Victor 9000, 896 KiB. Memory management on the IBM family was made complex by the need to maintain backward compatibility to the original PC design and real-mode DOS, while allowing computer users to take advantage of large amounts of low-cost memory and new generations of processors. Since DOS has given way to Microsoft Windows and other 32-bit operating systems not restricted by the original arbitrary 640 KiB limit of the IBM PC, managing the memory of a personal computer no longer requires the user to manually manipulate internal settings and parameters of the system.

The 640 KiB limit imposed great complexity on hardware and software intended to circumvent it; the physical memory in a machine could be organized as a combination of base or conventional memory (including lower memory), upper memory, high memory (not the same as upper memory), extended memory, and expanded memory, all handled in different ways.

== Conventional memory ==

The Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM PC had 20 address lines and so could directly address 1 MiB (220 bytes) of memory. Different areas of this address space were allocated to different kinds of memory used for different purposes. Starting at the lowest end of the address space, the PC had read/write random access memory (RAM) installed, which was used by DOS and application programs. The first part of this memory was installed on the motherboard of the system (in very early machines, 64 KiB, later revised to 256 KiB). Additional memory could be added with cards plugged into the expansion slots; each card contained straps or switches to control what part of the address space accesses memory and devices on that card.

On the IBM PC, all the address space up to 640 KiB was available for RAM. This part of the address space is called &quot;conventional memory&quot; since it is accessible to all versions of DOS automatically on startup. Segment 0, the first 64 KiB of conventional memory, is also called low memory area. Normally expansion memory is set to be contiguous in the address space with the memory on the motherboard. If there was an unallocated gap between motherboard memory and the expansion memory, the memory would not be automatically detected as usable by DOS.

== Upper memory area ==

The upper memory area (UMA) refers to the address space between 640 and 1024 KiB (0xA0000–0xFFFFF). The 128 KiB region between 0xA0000 and 0xBFFFF was reserved for VGA screen memory and legacy SMM. The 128 KiB region between 0xC0000 and 0xDFFFF was reserved for device Option ROMs, including Video BIOS. The 64 KiB region between 0xE0000 to 0xEFFFF was reserved for BIOS as lower BIOS area. The 64 KiB region between 0xF0000 and 0xFFFFF was reserved for BIOS as upper BIOS area.

For example, the monochrome video adapter memory area ran from 704 to 736 KiB (0xB0000–0xB7FFF). If only a monochrome display adapter was used, the address space between 0xA0000 and 0xAFFFF could be used for RAM, which would be contiguous with the conventional memory.

The system BIOS ROMs must be at the upper end of the address space because the CPU starting address is fixed by the design of the processor. The starting address is loaded into the program counter of the CPU after a hardware reset and must have a defined value that endures after power is interrupted to the system. On reset or power up, the CPU loads the address from the system ROM and then jumps to a defined ROM location to begin executing the system power-on self-test, and eventually load an operating system.

Since an expansion card such as a video adapter, hard drive controller, or network adapter could use allocations of memory in many of the upper memory areas, configuration of some combinations of cards required careful reading of documentation, or experimentation, to find card settings and memory mappings that worked. Mapping two devices to use the same physical memory addresses could result in a stalled or unstable system. Not all addresses in the upper memory area were used in a typical system; unused physical addresses would return undefined and system-dependent data if accessed by the processor.

== Expanded memory ==

As memory prices declined, application programs such as spreadsheets and computer-aided drafting were changed to take advantage of more and more physical memory in the system. Virtual memory in the 8088 and 8086 was not supported by the processor hardware, and disk technology of the time would make it too slow and cumbersome to be practical. Expanded memory was a system that allowed application programs to access more RAM than directly visible to the processor&#x27;s address space. The process was a form of bank switching. When extra RAM was needed, driver software would temporarily make a piece of expanded memory accessible to the processor; when the data in that piece of memory was updated, another part could be swapped into the processor&#x27;s address space. For the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT, with only 20 address lines, special-purpose expanded memory cards were made containing perhaps a megabyte, or more, of expanded memory, with logic on the board to make that memory accessible to the processor in defined parts of the 8088 address space.

Allocation and use of expanded memory was not transparent to application programs. The application had to keep track of which bank of expanded memory contained a particular piece of data, and when access to that data was required, the application had to request (through a driver program) the expanded memory board to map that part of memory into the processor&#x27;s address space. Although applications could use expanded memory with relative freedom, many other software components such as drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) were still normally constrained to reside within the 640K &quot;conventional memory&quot; area, which soon became a critically scarce resource.

==The 80286 and the high memory area ==

When the IBM PC/AT was introduced, the segmented memory architecture of the Intel family processors had the byproduct of allowing slightly more than 1 MiB of memory to be addressed in the &quot;real&quot; mode. Since the 80286 had more than 20 address lines, certain combinations of segment and offset could point into memory above the 0x0100000 (220) location. The 80286 could address up to 16 MiB of system memory, thus removing the behavior of memory addresses &quot;wrapping around&quot;. Since the required address line now existed, the combination F800:8000 would no longer point to the physical address 0x0000000 but the correct address 0x00100000.

As a result, some DOS programs would no longer work. To maintain compatibility with the PC and XT behavior, the AT included an &quot;A20 line&quot; gate (Gate A20) that made memory addresses on the AT wrap around to low memory as they would have on an 8088 processor. This gate could be controlled, initially through the keyboard controller, to allow running programs which were designed for this to access an additional 65,520 bytes (64 KiB) of memory in real mode. At boot time, the BIOS first enables A20 when counting and testing all of the system&#x27;s memory, and disables it before transferring control to the operating system. Enabling the A20 line is one of the first steps a protected mode x86 operating system does in the bootup process, often before control has been passed onto the kernel from the bootstrap (in the case of Linux, for example).

The &quot;high memory area&quot; (&quot;HMA&quot;) is the RAM area consisting of the first 64 KiB, minus 16 bytes, of the extended memory on an IBM PC/AT or compatible microcomputer.

Originally, the logic gate was a gate connected to the Intel 8042 keyboard controller. Controlling it was a relatively slow process. Other methods have since been added to allow for more efficient multitasking of programs which require this wrap-around with programs that access all of the system&#x27;s memory. There was at first a variety of methods, but eventually the industry settled on the PS/2 method of using a bit in port 92h to control the A20 line.

Disconnecting A20 would not wrap all memory accesses above 1 MiB, just those in the 1 MiB, 3 MiB, 5 MiB, etc. ranges. Real mode software only cared about the area slightly above 1 MiB, so Gate A20 was enough.

Virtual 8086 mode, introduced with the Intel 80386, allows the A20 wrap-around to be simulated by using the virtual memory facilities of the processor: physical memory may be mapped to multiple virtual addresses, thus allowing that the memory mapped at the first megabyte of virtual memory may be mapped again in the second megabyte of virtual memory. The operating system may intercept changes to Gate A20 and make corresponding changes to the virtual memory address space, which also makes irrelevant the efficiency of Gate-A20 toggling.

The first user of the HMA among Microsoft products was Windows 2.0 in 1987, which introduced the HIMEM.SYS device driver. Starting with versions 5.0 of DR-DOS (1990) and of MS-DOS (1991), parts of the operating system could be loaded into HMA as well, freeing up to 46 KiB of conventional memory. Other components, such as device drivers and TSRs, could be loaded into the upper memory area (UMA).

80286 introduced a MMIO memory hole (15 MiB to 16 MiB) for some ISA devices.

===A20 handler===

The &quot;A20 handler&quot; is software controlling access to the high memory area. Extended memory managers usually provide this functionality. In DOS, high memory area managers, such as HIMEM.SYS had the extra task of managing A20 and provided an API for opening/closing A20. DOS itself could utilize the area for some of its storage needs, thereby freeing up more conventional memory for programs. This functionality was enabled by the &quot;DOS=HIGH&quot; directive in the CONFIG.SYS configuration file.

===A20 gate on later processors===

The Intel 80486 and Pentium added a special pin named &quot;A20M#&quot;, which when asserted low forces bit 20 of the physical address to be zero for all on-chip cache or external memory accesses. This was necessary since the 80486 introduced an on-chip cache, and therefore masking this bit in external logic was no longer possible. Software still needs to manipulate the gate and must still deal with external peripherals (the chipset) for that.

==80386 and subsequent processors==
Intel processors from the 386 onward allowed a virtual 8086 mode, which simplified the hardware required to implement expanded memory for DOS applications. Expanded memory managers such as Quarterdeck&#x27;s QEMM product and Microsoft&#x27;s EMM386 supported the expanded memory standard without requirement for special memory boards.

On 386 and subsequent processors, memory managers like QEMM might move the bulk of the code for a driver or TSR into extended memory and replace it with a small fingerhold that was capable of accessing the extended-memory-resident code. They might analyze memory usage to detect drivers that required more RAM during startup than they did subsequently, and recover and reuse the memory that was no longer needed after startup. They might even remap areas of memory normally used for memory-mapped I/O. Many of these tricks involved assumptions about the functioning of drivers and other components. In effect, memory managers might reverse-engineer and modify other vendors&#x27; code on the fly. As might be expected, such tricks did not always work. Therefore, memory managers also incorporated very elaborate systems of configurable options, and provisions for recovery should a selected option render the PC unbootable (a frequent occurrence).

Installing and configuring a memory manager might involve hours of experimentation with options, repeatedly rebooting the machine, and testing the results. But conventional memory was so valuable that PC owners felt that such time was well-spent if the result was to free up 30 or 40 KiB of conventional memory space.

== Extended memory ==

In the context of IBM PC-compatible computers, &quot;extended memory&quot; refers to memory in the address space of the 80286 and subsequent processors, beyond the 1 megabyte limit imposed by the 20 address lines of the 8088 and 8086. Such memory is not directly available to DOS applications running in the so-called &quot;real mode&quot; of the 80286 and subsequent processors. This memory is only accessible in the protected or virtual modes of 80286 and higher processors.

<text>In humans and other mammals, the caudal cell mass (also tail bud or caudal eminence in humans) is the aggregate of undifferentiated cells at the caudal end on the spine. The caudal end of the spinal cord first begins to form after primary neurulation has taken place, indicating that it develops after the cranial portion of the spinal cord has developed. Following neurulation, the caudal tail begins to form a neurocoele as it develops a hollow core. After this, secondary neurulation occurs in which the medullary cord begins to form and is filled with many cavities that ultimately form the lumen. The cavities formed from the initial and secondary neurulation combine to form one uninterrupted cavity. There is still speculation on the formation of the caudal cell mass in humans with arguments being made for it arising from many cavities or the continuing growth of the neurocoele from the initial neurulation. The caudal cell mass will ultimately differentiate and form into many sacral structures such various nerve endings and the conus medullaris.

== Role in disease ==
The caudal cell mass plays a role in many diseases and abnormalities related to the spinal cord. One group of abnormalities it plays a role in are occult spinal dysraphisms. These types of abnormalities arise from specific structures formed in the caudal mass, for example if proper differentiation of the caudal mass does not occur, it could result in a type of spinal dysraphism. One example of spinal dysraphism is caudal regression syndrome. Patients with caudal regression syndrome can experience a varying degree of the abnormality ranging from partial lack of the tail bone and pelvis to more significant cases where there may be paralysis and, as a result, inhibited function in the bowel and bladder. This abnormality can be caused by the caudal cell mass not developing properly due to improper differentiation, and it can lead to sacral agenesis, which is one of the hallmarks of caudal regression syndrome.

Another class of abnormalities from caudal cell mass development includes caudal dysgenesis, which refers to abnormalities where the sacrum may be deformed or absent, or abnormalities in which the spinal cord and the complementary organ systems may be malformed. Some of the abnormalities that fall under this class includes currarino syndrome and sirenomelia. These genetic defects were found to have a much higher rate of incidence in births to mothers with gestational diabetes. This trend may be due to the inhibition of critical elements of morphogenesis, that are found in the extracellular matrix, or due to the presence of an abnormal hox gene. These abnormalities can be predicted ahead of time using ultrasound.

<doc id="402133" wikidata="Q321068" url="?curid=402133" title="Abietic acid">
<text>Abietic acid (also known as &quot;abietinic acid&quot; or &quot;sylvic acid&quot;) is a diterpenoid found in coniferous trees. It is supposed to exist as a defend the host plant from insect attack or various wounds. Chemically, it is a complicated molecule featuring two alkene groups and a carboxylic acid within a chiral tricyclic framework. As the major component of rosin, it is commercially important. Historically speaking, it was a major component of naval stores. It is the most common of the resin acids. Another common resin acid is pimaric acid, which converts to abietic acid upon heating.

==Characteristics and occurrence==
Abietic acid is found in rosin obtained from pine trees. Pure abietic acid is a colorless solid, but commercial samples are usually a glassy or partly crystalline yellowish solid that melts at temperatures as low as . Abietic acid is soluble in alcohols, acetone, and ethers. Its esters and salts are called an abietates, e.g. ethyl abietate and sodium abietate.

The ancient presence of abietic acid (and other resin acids), being abundant and resilient, can inferred by analysis of rocks and archeological samples. Through the process of diagenesis, abietic acid changes into a collection of simpler compounds called abietanes.

==Biosynthesis==

Abietic acid is derived from the diterpene abietadiene, which in turn is made from copalyl pyrophosphate (CPP), which is derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ( GGPP), the precursor to many diterpenoids. In air and in the presence of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, abietadiene is oxidized to abietic acid. An entire family of so-called resin acids form similarly. Together with abietic acid, these resin acids are a major portion of rosin, the solid portion of the oleoresin of coniferous trees.
The conformation of the GGPP molecule dictates the stereochemistry of the CPP intermediate after cyclization. The stereochemistry of the typical abietane skeleton suggests a GGPP precursor with its fused cyclohexyl rings in a chair-chair (&quot;normal&quot;) conformation, although some abietanes with alternative stereochemistry may be cyclized from CCP isomers containing alternative combinations of boat and chair cyclohexane conformers. After the initial cyclization to CPP, which forms rings A and B in the abietane skeleton, the C ring is formed with the help of a class I diterpene synthase enzyme. Subsequent methyl migration and dehydrogenation steps yield the abietene isomers.

==Preparation==
Abietic acid is extracted from tree rosin. Laboratory procedures illustrate the nature of the extraction, which is the basis of a substantial industry, formerly known as naval stores.

==Uses==

As a component of rosin and one of the principal resin acid]]s, abietic acid has many uses, e.g. in some paints, soaps, foods, soldering flux,

==Safety==
* As the chief component of rosin, abietic acid is approved by the US FDA as a miscellaneous food additive.
* Abietic acid is considered a &quot;nonhazardous natural substance&quot; in tall oil (&quot;liquid rosin&quot;).
* In the U.S., abietic acid is listed in the inventory of the Toxic Substances Control Act.
* Abietic acid is the primary irritant in pine wood and resin. As a contact allergen it is the cause of abietic acid dermatitis. (However, compounds resulting from its oxidation by air elicit stronger responses.) 
* 50% ethanol extracts from &quot;Resina pini&quot; of Pinus sp. (Pinaceae) showed inhibitory activity against testosterone 5α-reductase prepared from rat prostate. The fraction responsible for this activity was purified, and the active constituent was isolated and identified as abietic acid, which exhibited potent inhibitory activity against testosterone 5α-reductase &quot;in vitro&quot;.

<text>The Pripyat or Prypiat is a river in Eastern Europe. The river, which is approximately long, flows east through Ukraine, Belarus, and Ukraine again, draining into the Dnieper.

==Name etymology==
Max Vasmer in his etymological dictionary notes that the historical name of the river mentioned in the earliest East Slavic document, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, is &quot;Pripet&#x27;&quot; (), and cites the opinion of other linguists that the name meant &quot;tributary&quot;, comparing with Greek and Latin roots. He also rejects some opinions which were improperly based on the stem &quot;-pjat″&quot;, rather than original .

It might also derive from the local word &quot;pripech&quot; used for a river with sandy banks.

==Overview==
The Pripyat passes through the exclusion zone established around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The city of Pripyat, Ukraine (population 45,000) was completely evacuated after the Chernobyl disaster.

Pripyat has a catchment area of , of which are in Belarus. of the whole river length lies within Belarus.

As of 2020, it is being dredged to enable the E40 waterway.

==Location==
The Pripyat begins in the Volhynian Upland, between the villages of and in Volyn Oblast, Ukraine. After 204 km downstream, it crosses the border of Belarus, where it travels 500 km through Polesia, Europe&#x27;s largest wilderness, within which lie the vast sandy wetlands known as the Pinsk marshes, a dense network of swamps, bogs, rivers and rivulets within a forested basin. For the last 50 kilometers the Pripyat flows again in Ukraine and flows several kilometers south of Chernobyl into the Kyiv Reservoir.

==Geography==

The length of the river is 775 kilometers. The area of the watershed is 114,300 km2. The Pripyat valley in the upper reaches is weak, in the lower reaches it is clearer. The floodplain is well-developed all along the flow, allocating two supra-floodplain terraces. The width of the floodplain in the upper course of 2–4 km and more, in some years, is flooded for several months. In the lower reaches, the width of the floodplain reaches 10–15 km. The channel in the upper canalized; below - winding, forms meanders, oxbows, many channels (one of them overlays the ); there are sandy islands. The width of the river in the upper reaches is up to 40 m, on the average - 50–70 m, in the lower reaches 100 - predominantly 250 m, with the entrance to the Kyiv Reservoir - 4–5 km. The bottom is sandy and sandy-silty. The slope of the river is 0.08 m / km.

<doc id="402136" wikidata="Q17275488" url="?curid=402136" title="List of English words of Russian origin">
<text>Many languages, including English, contain words (Russianisms) most likely borrowed from the Russian language. Not all of the words are of purely Russian or origin. Some of them co-exist in other Slavic languages, and it can be difficult to determine whether they entered English from Russian or, say, Bulgarian. Some other words are borrowed or constructed from classical ancient languages, such as Latin or Greek. Still others are themselves borrowed from indigenous peoples that Russians have come into contact with in Russian or Soviet territory.

Compared to other source languages, English contains few words adopted from Russian. Direct borrowing first began with contact between England and Russia in the 16th century and picked up heavily in the 20th century, with the establishment of the Soviet Union as a major world power. Most of these words denote things and notions specific to Russia, Russian culture, politics, and history, but also well known outside Russia. Some others are in mainstream usage and independent of any Russian context.

While both English and Russian are distantly related members of Indo-European and therefore share a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European, cognate pairs such as &quot;mother&quot; – &quot;мать&quot; (&quot;mat″&quot;) will be excluded from the list.

<text>The Five Keys were an American rhythm and blues vocal group who were instrumental in shaping this genre in the 1950s.

They were formed with the original name of Sentimental Four in Newport News, Virginia, US, in the late 1940s, and initially consisted of two sets of brothers – Rudy West and Bernie West, and Ripley Ingram and Raphael Ingram. Raphael Ingram left in 1949 and Maryland Pierce and Thomas &#x27;Dickie&#x27; Threatt became members in his place. At this juncture the name of the group was changed to The Five Keys.

They were signed to Aladdin Records in 1951, and in 1952 Rudy West left to join the United States Army, and he was replaced by Ulysses K. Hicks. When Hicks died of a heart attack in Boston in 1955, Rudy West returned to the group. In 1954 Dickie Smith left and was replaced with Ramon Loper. At this point the Five Keys were signed to Capitol Records, and their popularity increased, although more instrumentation was used.

The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

<text>Michel Roger Lafosse (born 21 April 1958 in Watermael-Boitsfort, Brussels, Belgium), subsequently known as Michael James Alexander Stewart of Albany, claims to be a descendant of Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;) and to be the legitimate Jacobite claimant to the throne of the Kingdom of Scotland.

Since 1979 he has referred to himself as &quot;HRH Prince Michael James Alexander Stewart, 7th Count of Albany&quot;, stating that an ancestor used the title &quot;Count of Albany&quot;. Lafosse also says he has the right to other noble titles including Comte de Blois, Duc d&#x27;Aquitaine and Baron Lafosse de Chatry.

==The House of Stuart and Lafosse&#x27;s claims==
The Royal House of Stuart became extinct in the male line with the death in 1807 of Henry Benedict Stuart, called &quot;King Henry IX&quot; by Jacobites, who succeeded his elder brother Charles Edward Stuart in 1788. Charles was survived only by an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany, and her own illegitimate son Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart and daughters. The Jacobite claim to the British throne then passed to members of various continental Catholic dynasties, most recently to Franz, Duke of Bavaria, head of the Wittelsbach dynasty.

Lafosse claims that this history is inaccurate and that the Stuart line did not end with the death of Henry Benedict Stuart. Instead, Lafosse says that Charles Edward Stuart secretly obtained a papal annulment of his marriage to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern and, subsequently, in a secret ceremony, married a woman called Marguerite O&#x27;Dea d&#x27;Audibert de Lussan, Comtesse de Massillan. He says this union produced an heir in 1786, a son, Edward James Stuart, Count Stuarton, Count of Albany, from whom he says he is descended.

Lafosse says he is the son of &quot;HRH Princess Renee Stewart, Lady Derneley&quot; (according to Lafosse, the senior descendant in the female line of Edward James Stuart), and &quot;Gustave Lafosse de Chatry, 5th Baron de Chatry&quot;. These individuals, as well as others, are listed in an extensive genealogy presented by Lafosse as evidence that he is descended from the last Stuart King of Scotland.

There is some disagreement over who Lafosse&#x27;s parents and ancestors were. Lafosse says he was born on 21 April 1958 in the Ville de Bruxelles district, and that his parents were Baron Gustave Joseph Fernand Clément Lafosse and Princess Renée Julienne Stewart. In 2002, Brussels authorities stated that this certificate is a forgery, and that they have a birth certificate showing that Lafosse was born in Brussels on 21 April 1958, in the Watermael-Boitsfort district to Gustave Joseph Clément Fernand Lafosse, a shopkeeper, and Renée Julienne Dée, a business employee.

Peter Piniski, in &quot;The Stuarts&#x27; Last Secret&quot;, says of Lafosse&#x27;s assertion:

One recent, heroically unsubstantiated claim is that Prince Charles married in 1785 and fathered a legitimate child. This &#x27;fact&#x27; (which has escaped the notice of every historian for over two hundred years!), is particularly imaginative considering the prince was married at the time, being only separated from Louise von Stolberg-Gedern, after April 3rd 1784, who remained under the protection of the Pope. Nor was eighteenth century Rome the best of cities for an internationally known Roman Catholic prince to commit bigamy. It also ignores Charles&#x27; wretchedly infirm condition from before that date until his death three years later. Likewise does it ignore the presence (and insult the memory) of Charles&#x27; daughter and sole heir, Charlotte, who was daily at her father&#x27;s side, nursing him right up to the moment of his death despite her own cancer. Professing direct descent on the female line from this &#x27;marriage&#x27; the same claimant equally fails to provide any evidence, proper references or verifiable source documents for his additional assertion of descent on the male line from not one, but both daughters of Charlotte Stuart. Professor Lenman describes all of this as: &#x27;The industry of Stuart charlatanism&#x27;.

Lafosse has also stated that he was &quot;President of the European Council of Princes&quot;, following Archduke Otto of Austria&#x27;s tenure in that position. Archduke Otto later said that he had never been president of any such body, or a member of any such body, and that, in fact, he had never heard of it.

==&quot;The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland&quot;==
Written by Lafosse, &quot;The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland: The True Story of the Royal House of Stewart and the Hidden Lineage of the Kings and Queens of Scots&quot; is a book published in Shaftesbury, England, in 1998. The book claims to provide previously unknown accounts of the life of Charles Edward Stuart, the last head of the Royal House of Stuart, during his exile from Britain.

Lafosse, who claims descent from Charles, includes within the book various accounts of previously unknown marriages and births within the Royal House of Stuart, beginning with the secret annulment of the marriage of Charles Edward Stuart and Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, and his subsequent remarriage to Marguerite O&#x27;Dea d&#x27;Audibert de Lussan, Comtesse de Massillan.

==Present activities==
Although born in Belgium as Michel Roger Lafosse, he became a naturalized British citizen in the 1990s and has since used the name Michael James Alexander Stewart of Albany. His website stated that he was a diplomat of the self-styled &quot;Federation of Autonomous Priories of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Knights of Malta&quot; (not the Sovereign Military Order of Malta or one of the Protestant Alliance Orders), and a cultural attaché at the Knights of Malta&#x27;s embassy in the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe in West Africa; and that he has been awarded the United Nations 2001 &quot;Volunteer Service Medal&quot; under the name &quot;Albany&quot;.

Lafosse claimed to be the Fons Honorum and Grand Protector of The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court and Order in Britain and the English-speaking world.

On 18 June 2006 the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; reported that Lafosse was to be deported after having lost British citizenship because, it is alleged, he submitted a forged birth certificate. Later, on 23 July 2006, the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; reported that, in the wake of the publicity surrounding his claims and his loss of British citizenship, Lafosse had sold his house in Edinburgh and returned to Belgium to live with his mother.

His latest book, co-authored with Walid Amine Salhab, is &quot;The Knights Templar of the Middle East: The Hidden History of the Islamic Origins of Freemasonry&quot; (2006).

<doc id="402158" wikidata="Q804135" url="?curid=402158" title="Biwako Line">
<text>The is the nickname used by the operator of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) to refer to the portion of the Tōkaidō Main Line (between Maibara Station and Kyoto Station) and the Hokuriku Main Line (between Maibara Station and Nagahama Station). The section, along with JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line, forms a contiguous service that is the main trunk of JR West&#x27;s &quot;Urban Network&quot; commuter rail network in the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto Metropolitan Area.

==Overview==

The line is named after , which the route runs along. Line nicknames were introduced when the newly privatized JR West intended to use &quot;familiar&quot; names over official line names, such as Tōkaidō Main Line and Fukuchiyama Line. Biwako Line did not appear on the first list, and instead The JR Kyoto Line was to be called up to Maibara. A move in Shiga Prefecture opposed the name, claiming that the name of Kyoto Line in Shiga sounds like an auxiliary, requiring its own name in the prefecture. Biwako Line was thus made to refer to the section between Maibara and Kyoto.

The section of the name was extended to Nagahama, on the alteration of electric supply from 20 kV AC to 1,500 V DC, which enabled through operation to Kyoto and Osaka.

Although the &quot;Biwako Line&quot; nickname is used by the operator JR West for passenger announcements, the official status of Tōkaidō Main Line has not been changed or discussed. The counterpart for the line, Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) uses its official name &quot;Tōkaidō Main Line&quot; for the section of JR West, at the connections of Kyoto and Maibara. The &quot;Biwako Line&quot; nickname appears in some local newspapers and real estate advertisements. Frequent passengers understand that the Biwako, JR Kyoto, JR Kobe lines are in fact one line, however, public recognition of the name is still in question, especially among non-users along the line.

==Trains==

*Special Rapid Service (新快速):
** Trains terminate at Nagahama, Maibara and Yasu (some trains continue on Hokuriku Line to Omi-Shiotsu and Tsuruga). Stops at Nagahama, Tamura, Sakata, Maibara, Hikone, Notogawa, Omi-Hachiman, Yasu, Moriyama, Kusatsu, Minami-Kusatsu, Ishiyama, Otsu, Yamashina, and Kyoto.

***These local trains are mainly operated on the Biwako Line and make every stop on the line. They terminate at Maibara and Yasu.
**JR Kyoto Line local trains (4 doors par car)
***JR Kyoto Line local service extends to Yasu during rush hour on weekdays.

==Stations==

Stations are listed from east to west. The distance of Tokyo – Maibara is , and that of Tokyo – Kyoto is . Historically, the Tōkaidō Main Line continued from Tokyo to Kyoto and beyond, through Maibara. In the Japanese timetable books, the distances from Tokyo are still shown in the table, although the Biwako Line&#x27;s officially begins at Maibara. 

*●: Trains stop.

<text>Joshua Lawrence (1778–1843), of Tarboro, North Carolina, was an influential Baptist minister in the eastern United States during the Baptist missions controversy in the early 19th century.

Joshua Lawrence was born September 10, 1778. Lawrence (or Lawrence&#x27;s) in Edgecombe County, North Carolina was named for his family. He began preaching when he was about 23 years old. He quickly became an active and influential minister in the Kehukee Baptist Association. The Kehukee Association was organized in Halifax County, North Carolina in 1765 and is generally considered the fourth oldest Baptist association in the United States1. Lawrence was often called upon to represent them at other associational meetings, and was regularly chosen to preach before the body and to serve on its committees (both before and after the separation of 1827). He was a man of limited education, but possessed natural talents of oratory and logic. He was a popular preacher among his contemporaries.

In 1814, the &quot;Baptist Board of Foreign Missions&quot; was formed, which set about a controversy that would divide the Baptists in the United States. On one side were those who promoted the use of foreign and home mission societies, theological seminaries, and various church auxiliaries, and on the other side were those who rejected them as not conforming to the Scriptures. Joshua Lawrence took the position that such auxiliaries and societies were without scriptural command or example, and became one of the leading voices on the east coast against them. Hassell credits Lawrence with saving the Kehukee Association from becoming part of the missionary movement. Through his influence, the growing &quot;missionary tide&quot;, led by Elder Martin Ross, was abated and in 1827 the Kehukee Association &quot;agreed that we discard all Missionary Societies, Bible Societies and Theological Seminaries...believing these societies and institutions to be inventions of men, and not warranted from the word of God.&quot; In the two years following, the Kehukee Association reaffirmed this stance against opposition, and afterward became one of the leading &quot;anti-missionary&quot; associations. It is today considered the oldest Primitive Baptist association in existence. In Lawrence&#x27;s day, the terminology &quot;Primitive Baptist&quot; was not in common usage, and the preferred term was usually &quot;Old School&quot; Baptist, which still retains a strong usage among Primitive Baptists on the east coast.

Tarboro Church (now Primitive Baptist) was organized on February 7, 1819, by elders Joshua Lawrence, Martin Ross, Thomas Billings, and Thomas Meredith.

Some writings of Lawrence include &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, written in 1812, &quot;Declaration of Church Principles&quot; (1826), &quot;A Patriotic Discourse&quot;, preached on July 4, 1830, and later published, and &quot;Teeth to Teeth: Tom Thumb Tugging with the Wolves for the Sheepskin&quot;, written in 1837. Though not well known or widely read outside the Primitive Baptist movement, a few of Lawrence&#x27;s writings are made available by the &quot;Primitive Baptist Library&quot; in Carthage, Illinois.

Joshua Lawrence married Mary Knight. He died in January 1843.

Sylvester Hassell summarized Lawrence&#x27;s life in this way: &quot;For more than forty years he advocated powerfully and fearlessly, both from pulpit and press, liberty of conscience, the specialty, spirituality and efficacy of God&#x27;s salvation, and the unscripturalness and corruption of all the money based religious institutions of the nineteenth century, notwithstanding storms of slander and , and threats against his life, and during the latter part of his life, great physical debility and suffering.&quot; (Chapter 23, &quot;History of the Church of God&quot;)

<text>Visual inspection is a common method of quality control, data acquisition, and data analysis.
Visual Inspection, used in maintenance of facilities, mean inspection of equipment and structures using either or all of raw human senses such as vision, hearing, touch and smell and/or any non-specialized inspection equipment.
Inspections requiring Ultrasonic, X-Ray equipment, Infrared, etc. are not typically regarded as visual inspection as these Inspection methodologies require specialized equipment, training and certification.

==Quality control==
A study of the visual inspection of small integrated circuits found that the modal duration of eye fixations of trained inspectors was about 200 ms. The most accurate inspectors made the fewest eye fixations and were the fastest. When the same chip was judged more than once by an individual inspector the consistency of judgment was very high whereas the consistency between inspectors was somewhat less. Variation by a factor of six in inspection speed led to variation of less than a factor of two in inspection accuracy. Visual inspection had a false positive rate of 2% and a false negative rate of 23%.

==Humorous terminology==
To do an eyeball search is to look for something specific in a mass of code or data with one&#x27;s own eyes, as opposed to using some sort of pattern matching software like grep or any other automated search tool. Also known as vgrep or ogrep, i.e., &quot;visual/optical grep&quot;. See also vdiff.

&quot;Eyeballing&quot; is the most common and readily available method of initial data assessment. This method is effective for identifying patterns or anomalies in complex data but can be time-intensive and error-prone. Although low-cost and adaptable, its efficiency and ROI often fall short compared to automated tools, which offer greater scalability and consistency. However, switching from manual visual inspection to automated methods depends on the task&#x27;s complexity, scale, and the balance between upfront costs and long-term efficiency.

Experts in pattern recognition maintain that the &quot;eyeball&quot; technique is still the most effective procedure for searching arbitrary, possibly unknown structures in data.

In the military, applying this sort of search to real-world terrain is often referred to as &quot;using the Mark I Eyeball&quot; device (pronounced as Mark One Eyeball), the U.S. military adopting it in 1950s. The term is an allusion on military nomenclature, &quot;Mark I&quot; being the first version of a military vehicle or weapon.

<doc id="402178" wikidata="Q176121" url="?curid=402178" title="Thyratron">
<text>A thyratron is a type of gas-filled tube used as a high-power electrical switch and controlled rectifier. Thyratrons can handle much greater currents than similar hard-vacuum tubes. Electron multiplication occurs when the gas becomes ionized, producing a phenomenon known as a Townsend discharge. Gases used include mercury vapor, xenon, neon, and (in special high-voltage applications or applications requiring very short switching times) hydrogen. Unlike a vacuum tube (valve), a thyratron cannot be used to amplify signals linearly.

In the 1920s, thyratrons were derived from early vacuum tubes such as the UV-200, which contained a small amount of argon gas to increase its sensitivity as a radio signal detector, and the German LRS relay tube, which also contained argon gas. Gas rectifiers, which predated vacuum tubes, such as the argon-filled General Electric &quot;Tungar bulb&quot; and the Cooper-Hewitt mercury-pool rectifier, also provided an influence. Irving Langmuir and G. S. Meikle of GE are usually cited as the first investigators to study controlled rectification in gas tubes, about 1914. The first commercial thyratrons appeared circa 1928.

The term &quot;thyratron&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;θύρα&quot; (&quot;thyra&quot;), meaning &quot;door&quot; or &quot;valve&quot;. The term &quot;thyristor&quot; was further derived from a combination of &quot;thyratron&quot; and &quot;transistor&quot;. Since the 1960s thyristors have replaced thyratrons in most low- and medium-power applications.

==Description==
Thyratrons resemble vacuum tubes both in appearance and construction but differ in behavior and operating principle. In a vacuum tube, conduction is dominated by free electrons because the distance between anode and cathode is small compared to the mean free path of electrons. A thyratron, on the other hand, is intentionally filled with gas so that the distance between anode and cathode is comparable with the mean free path of electrons. This causes conduction in a thyratron to be dominated by plasma conductivity. Due to the high conductivity of plasma, a thyratron is capable of switching higher currents than vacuum tubes which are limited by space charge. A vacuum tube has the advantage that conductivity may be modulated at any time whereas a thyratron becomes filled with plasma and continues to conduct as long as a voltage exists between the anode and cathode. A pseudospark switch operates in a similar regime of the Paschen curve as a thyratron and is sometimes called a cold cathode thyratron.

A thyratron consists of a hot cathode, an anode, and one or more control grids between the anode and cathode in an airtight glass or ceramic envelope that is filled with gas. The gas is typically hydrogen or deuterium at a pressure of 300 to 500 mTorr (40 to 70 Pa). Commercial thyratrons also contain a titanium hydride reservoir and a reservoir heater that together maintain gas pressure over long periods regardless of gas loss.

Conductivity of a thyratron remains low as long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode because the grid repels electrons emitted by the cathode. Space charge limited electron current flows from the cathode through the control grid toward the anode if the grid is made positive relative to the cathode. Sufficiently high space charge limited current initiates Townsend discharge between anode and cathode. The resulting plasma provides high conductivity between anode and cathode and is not limited by space charge. Conductivity remains high until the current between anode and cathode drops to a small value for a sufficiently long time that the gas ceases to be ionized. This recovery process takes 25 to 75 μs and limits thyratron repetition rates to a few kHz.
==Applications==
Low-power thyratrons (&quot;relay tubes&quot; and &quot;trigger tubes&quot;) were manufactured for controlling incandescent lamps, electromechanical relays or solenoids, for bidirectional counters, to perform various functions in Dekatron calculators, for voltage threshold detectors in RC timers, etc. &quot;Glow thyratrons&quot; were optimized for high gas-discharge light output or even phosphorized and used as self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays.

Another use of the thyratron was in relaxation oscillators. Since the plate turn-on voltage is much higher than the turn-off voltage, the tube exhibits hysteresis and, with a capacitor across it, it can function as a sawtooth oscillator. The voltage on the grid controls the breakdown voltage and thus the period of oscillation. Thyratron relaxation oscillators were used in power inverters and oscilloscope sweep circuits.

One miniature thyratron, the triode 6D4, found an additional use as a potent noise source, when operated as a diode (grid tied to cathode) in a transverse magnetic field. Sufficiently filtered for &quot;flatness&quot; (&quot;white noise&quot;) in a band of interest, such noise was used for testing radio receivers, servo systems and occasionally in analog computing as a random value source.

The miniature RK61/2 thyratron marketed in 1938 was designed specifically to operate like a vacuum triode below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in radio control receivers, and was the major technical development which led to the wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of radio controlled modelling as a hobby.
Some early television sets, particularly British models, used thyratrons for vertical (frame) and horizontal (line) oscillators.

Medium-power thyratrons found applications in machine tool motor controllers, where thyratrons, operating as phase-controlled rectifiers, are utilized in the tool&#x27;s armature regulator (zero to &quot;base speed&quot;, &quot;constant torque&quot; mode) and in the tool&#x27;s field regulator (&quot;base speed&quot; to about twice &quot;base speed&quot;, &quot;constant horsepower&quot; mode). Examples include Monarch Machine Tool 10EE lathe, which used thyratrons from 1949 until solid-state devices replaced them in 1984.

High-power thyratrons are still manufactured, and are capable of operation up to tens of kiloamperes (kA) and tens of kilovolts (kV). Modern applications include pulse drivers for pulsed radar equipment, high-energy gas lasers, radiotherapy devices, particle accelerators and in Tesla coils and similar devices. Thyratrons are also used in high-power UHF television transmitters, to protect inductive output tubes from internal shorts, by grounding the incoming high-voltage supply during the time it takes for a circuit breaker to open and reactive components to drain their stored charges. This is commonly called a &quot;crowbar circuit&quot;.

Thyratrons have been replaced in most low and medium-power applications by corresponding semiconductor devices known as thyristors (sometimes called silicon-controlled rectifiers, or SCRs) and triacs. However, switching service requiring voltages above 20 kV and involving very short risetimes remains within the domain of the thyratron.

Variations of the thyratron idea are the krytron, the sprytron, the ignitron, and the triggered spark gap, all still used today in special applications, such as nuclear weapons (krytron) and AC/DC-AC power transmission (ignitron).

==Example of a small thyratron==

The &quot;885&quot; is a small thyratron tube, using argon gas. This device was used extensively in the timebase circuits of early oscilloscopes in the 1930s. It was employed in a circuit called a relaxation oscillator. During World War II, small thyratrons similar to the 885 were utilized in pairs to construct bistables, the &quot;memory&quot; cells used by early computers and code breaking machines. Thyratrons were also used for phase angle control of alternating current (AC) power sources in battery chargers and light dimmers, but these were usually of a larger current handling capacity than the 885. The 885 is a 2.5 volt, 5-pin based variant of the 884/6Q5.

<text>A nor&#x27;easter (also northeaster; see below) is a large-scale extratropical cyclone in the western North Atlantic Ocean. The name derives from the direction of the winds that blow from the northeast. Typically, such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within of the shore between North Carolina and Massachusetts. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms, although nor&#x27;easters are usually accompanied by heavy rain or snow, and can cause severe coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane-force winds, or blizzard conditions. They tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of November and March, because of the difference in temperature between the cold polar air mass coming down from central Canada and the warm ocean waters off the upper East Coast. The susceptible regions—the upper north Atlantic coast of the United States and the Atlantic Provinces of Canada—are generally impacted by nor&#x27;easters a few times each winter. 
==Etymology and usage==

The term &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; came to American English by way of British English. Early recorded uses of the contraction &quot;nor&quot; (for &quot;north&quot;) in combinations such as &quot;nor&#x27;-east&quot; and &quot;nor-nor-west&quot;, as reported by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, date to the late 16th century, as in John Davis&#x27;s 1594 &quot;The Seaman&#x27;s Secrets&quot;: &quot;Noreast by North raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues.&quot; The spelling appears, for instance, on a compass card published in 1607. Thus, the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 points of the compass, known in maritime training as &quot;boxing the compass&quot;, is described by Ansted with pronunciations &quot;Nor&#x27;east (or west),&quot; &quot;Nor&#x27; Nor&#x27;-east (or west),&quot; &quot;Nor&#x27;east b&#x27; east (or west),&quot; and so forth. According to the OED, the first recorded use of the term &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; occurs in 1836 in a translation of Aristophanes. The term &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailing.

As noted in a January 2006 editorial by William Sisson, editor of &quot;Soundings&quot; magazine, use of &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; to describe the storm system is common along the U.S. East Coast. Yet it has been asserted by linguist Mark Liberman (see below) that &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; as a contraction for &quot;northeaster&quot; has no basis in regional New England dialect; the Boston accent would elide the &quot;R&quot;: &quot;no&#x27;theastuh&quot;&#x27;. He describes nor&#x27;easter as a &quot;fake&quot; word. However, this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described above.

19th-century Downeast mariners pronounced the compass point &quot;north northeast&quot; as &quot;no&#x27;nuth-east&quot;, and so on. For decades, Edgar Comee, of Brunswick, Maine, waged a determined battle against use of the term &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; by the press, which usage he considered &quot;a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation&quot; and &quot;the odious, even loathsome, practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself&quot;. His efforts, which included mailing hundreds of postcards, were profiled, just before his death in 2005 at the age of 88, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Despite the efforts of Comee and others, use of the term continues by the press. According to &quot;Boston Globe&quot; writer Jan Freeman, &quot;from 1975 to 1980, journalists used the nor&#x27;easter spelling only once in five mentions of such storms; in the past year (2003), more than 80 percent of northeasters were spelled nor&#x27;easter&quot;.

University of Pennsylvania linguistics professor Mark Liberman has pointed out that while the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837, these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-New England poets and writers. Liberman posits that &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; may have originally been a literary affectation, akin to &quot;e&#x27;en&quot; for &quot;even&quot; and &quot;th&#x27;only&quot; for &quot;the only&quot;, which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse, with no implications for actual pronunciation.

However, despite these assertions, the term can be found in the writings of New Englanders, and was frequently used by the press in the 19th century.
* &quot;The Hartford Times&quot; reported on a storm striking New York in December 1839, and observed, &quot;We Yankees had a share of this same &quot;noreaster,&quot; but it was quite moderate in comparison to the one of the 15h inst.&quot;
* Thomas Bailey Aldrich, in his semi-autobiographical work &quot;The Story of a Bad Boy&quot; (1870), wrote &quot;We had had several slight flurries of hail and snow before, but this was a regular nor&#x27;easter&quot;.
* In her story &quot;In the Gray Goth&quot; (1869) Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote &quot;...and there was snow in the sky now, setting in for a regular nor&#x27;easter&quot;.
* John H. Tice, in &quot;A new system of meteorology, designed for schools and private students&quot; (1878), wrote &quot;During this battle, the dreaded, disagreeable and destructive Northeaster rages over the New England, the Middle States, and southward. No nor&#x27;easter ever occurs except when there is a high barometer headed off and driven down upon Nova Scotia and Lower Canada.&quot;

Usage existed into the 20th century in the form of:
* Current event description, as the Publication Committee of the New York Charity Organization Society wrote in &quot;Charities and the commons: a weekly journal of philanthropy and social advance, Volume 19&quot; (1908): &quot;In spite of a heavy &quot;nor&#x27;easter,&quot; the worst that has visited the New England coast in years, the hall was crowded.&quot;
* Historical reference, as used by Mary Rogers Bangs in &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot; (1917): &quot;In December of 1778, the Federal brig General Arnold, Magee master and twelve Barnstable men among the crew, drove ashore on the Plymouth flats during a furious nor&#x27;easter, the &quot;Magee storm&quot; that mariners, for years after, used as a date to reckon from.&quot;
* A &quot;common contraction for &quot;northeaster&quot;&quot;, as listed in Ralph E. Huschke&#x27;s &quot;Glossary of Meteorology&quot; (1959).

The Pacific Northwest is also affected by a similar class of powerful extratropical cyclones, known as Pacific Northwest windstorms. While the storms on the East Coast are named &quot;nor&#x27;easters&quot;, the Pacific Northwest windstorms are not called &quot;nor&#x27;westers&quot; because the cyclones&#x27; primary winds can blow from any direction, while the primary winds in nor&#x27;easters usually blow from the northeast.

==Geography and formation characteristics==

===Formation===
Nor&#x27;easters develop in response to the sharp contrast in the warm Gulf Stream ocean current coming up from the tropical Atlantic and the cold air masses coming down from Canada. Very cold and dry air rushing southward and meeting up with the warm Gulf stream current, which is typically near even mid-winter, often causes low-pressure areas to develop and intensify.

In the upper atmosphere, the strong winds of the jet stream remove and replace rising air from the Atlantic more rapidly than the Atlantic air is replaced at lower levels; this and the Coriolis force help develop a strong storm. The storm tracks northeast along the East Coast, normally from North Carolina to Long Island, then tracks east toward the waters off Cape Cod. Counterclockwise winds around the low-pressure system blow the moist air over land. The relatively warm, moist air meets cold air coming southward from Canada. The low increases the surrounding pressure difference, which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed. When the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger, so is the storm&#x27;s instability, turbulence, and thus severity.

The nor&#x27;easters taking the East Coast track usually indicates the presence of a high-pressure area in the vicinity of Nova Scotia. Sometimes a nor&#x27;easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain (New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc.) and snow in New England (Boston northward). On occasion, nor&#x27;easters can pull cold air as far south as Virginia or North Carolina, bringing wet snow inland in those areas for a brief time. Such a storm will rapidly intensify, tracking northward and following the topography of the East Coast, sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence. A nor&#x27;easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the Canadian coast. The storm then reaches Arctic areas, and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak hurricane. It then meanders throughout the North Atlantic and can last for several weeks.

Meteorologists use the Miller classification to determine the track and severity of a nor&#x27;easter. The technique is named after J.E. Miller, who created the system in 1946. The Miller classification classified storms into two categories: type A and type B. Type A storms form in the Gulf of Mexico or along the coast of Georgia or South Carolina, and cause heavy snow mainly to parts of the inland upper south, Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Atlantic Canada. Type B storms form from a parent low-pressure system over the Ohio Valley, which then undergoes a center reformation over Gulf Stream off North Carolina or Virginia. These storms can bring a swath of wintry precipitation from the Great Plains and the Ohio River Valley to the Middle Atlantic and New England.

===Characteristics===
Nor&#x27;easters are usually formed by an area of vorticity associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop. Such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms, a &quot;parent storm&quot;, and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream.

Temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction. During a single storm, the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist. All precipitation types can occur in a nor&#x27;easter. High wind gusts, which can reach hurricane strength, are also associated with a nor&#x27;easter. On very rare occasions, such as in the nor&#x27;easter in 1978, North American blizzard of 2006, Early February 2013 North American blizzard, and January 2018 North American blizzard, the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a hurricane and have a small &quot;dry slot&quot; near the center, which can be mistaken for an eye, although it is not an eye.

====Difference from tropical cyclones====
Often, people mistake nor&#x27;easters for tropical cyclones and do not differentiate between the two weather systems. Nor&#x27;easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor&#x27;easters are cold-core low-pressure systems, meaning that they thrive on drastic changes in temperature of Canadian air and warm Atlantic waters. Tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems, which means they thrive on purely warm temperatures. However, in rare cases, such as the 1991 Perfect Storm, a small tropical cyclone can develop inside the warm seclusion of an intense nor&#x27;easter if the sea surface temperatures are sufficiently warm. Nor&#x27;easters can rarely also turn into tropical or subtropical cyclones, such as Tropical Storm Wanda in 2021.

====Difference from other extratropical storms====
A nor&#x27;easter is a strong extratropical cyclone, often experiencing explosive cyclogenesis. While this formation occurs in many places around the world, nor&#x27;easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds. Nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the Pacific Northeast (northern Japan and northwards) with winds from NNW. In Europe, similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible; the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow, although northeasterly winds can be strong.

===Geography===
The eastern United States, from North Carolina to Maine, and Eastern Canada can experience nor&#x27;easters, though most often they affect the areas in the  Atlantic Canada and New England. The effects of a nor&#x27;easter sometimes bring high surf, strong winds and rain as far south as coastal South Carolina. Nor&#x27;easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas, as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas.

Biologists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod have determined nor&#x27;easters are an environmental factor for red tides on the Atlantic coast.

<doc id="402188" wikidata="Q421123" url="?curid=402188" title="Ammonium bicarbonate">
<text>Ammonium bicarbonate is an inorganic compound with formula (NH4)HCO3. The compound has many names, reflecting its long history. Chemically speaking, it is the bicarbonate salt of the ammonium ion. It is a colourless solid that degrades readily to carbon dioxide, water and ammonia.

==Production==
Ammonium bicarbonate is produced by combining carbon dioxide and ammonia:
Since ammonium bicarbonate is thermally unstable, the reaction solution is kept cold, which allows the precipitation of the product as white solid. About 100,000 tons were produced in this way in 1997.

Ammonia gas passed into a strong aqueous solution of the sesquicarbonate (a 2:1:1 mixture of (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, and H2O) converts it into normal ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3), which can be obtained in the crystalline condition from a solution prepared at about 30 °C. This compound on exposure to air gives off ammonia and reverts to ammonium bicarbonate.

===Salt of hartshorn===
Compositions containing ammonium carbonate have long been known. They were once produced commercially, formerly known as sal volatile or salt of hartshorn. It was obtained by the dry distillation of nitrogenous organic matter such as hair, horn, leather. In addition to ammonium bicarbonate, this material contains ammonium carbamate (NH4CO2NH2), and ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3). It is sometimes called ammonium sesquicarbonate. It possesses a strong ammoniacal smell, and on digestion with alcohol, the carbamate is dissolved leaving a residue of ammonium bicarbonate.

A similar decomposition takes place when the sesquicarbonate is exposed to air.

== Uses ==
Ammonium bicarbonate is used in the food industry as a leavening agent for flat baked goods, such as cookies and crackers. It was commonly used in the home before modern-day baking powder was made available. Many baking cookbooks, especially from Scandinavian countries, may still refer to it as hartshorn or hornsalt, while it is known as &quot;hirvensarvisuola&quot; in Finnish, &quot;hjortetakksalt&quot; or &quot;hornsalt&quot; in Norwegian, &quot;hjortetakssalt&quot; in Danish, &quot;hjorthornssalt&quot; in Swedish, and &quot;Hirschhornsalz&quot; in German (lit., &quot;salt of hart&#x27;s horn&quot;). Although there is a slight smell of ammonia during baking, this quickly dissipates, leaving no taste. It is used in, for example, Swedish &quot;drömmar&quot; biscuits and Danish &quot;klejner&quot; Christmas biscuits, and German Lebkuchen. In many cases it may be replaced with baking soda or baking powder, or a combination of both, depending on the recipe composition and leavening requirements. Compared to baking soda or potash, hartshorn has the advantage of producing more gas for the same amount of agent, and of not leaving any salty or soapy taste in the finished product, as it completely decomposes into water and gaseous products that evaporate during baking. It cannot be used for moist, bulky baked goods however, such as normal bread or cakes, since some ammonia will be trapped inside and will cause an unpleasant taste. It has been assigned E number E503 for use as a food additive in the European Union.

It is commonly used as an inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer in China, but is now being phased out in favor of urea for quality and stability. This compound is used as a component in the production of fire-extinguishing compounds, pharmaceuticals, dyes, pigments, and it is also a basic fertilizer, being a source of ammonia. Ammonium bicarbonate is still widely used in the plastics and rubber industry, in the manufacture of ceramics, in chrome leather tanning, and for the synthesis of catalysts.

It is also used for buffering solutions to make them slightly alkaline during chemical purification, such as high-performance liquid chromatography. Because it entirely decomposes to volatile compounds, this allows rapid recovery of the compound of interest by freeze-drying. Relatedly it is also useful as an alkaline buffering agent for analytical LC–MS as its volatility allows it to be rapidly removed automatically from the sample stream in the low pressure spray chambers used by many standard mass spectrometry detectors found at the end of typical LC-MS systems, such as electrospray ionization detectors. This is critical as most mass spectrometry detectors become signal saturated or even damaged with more than a trace amount of ions entering the detector proper at any one time. This issue limits buffering agents and other additives in LC-MS buffers to either extremely trace concentrations or to fairly volatile compounds. In pH ranges from about 7 to 9, ammonium bicarbonate is one of the only options available as the primary buffering agent for most LC-MS buffers.

Ammonium bicarbonate is also a key component of the expectorant cough syrup &quot;Senega and Ammonia&quot;.

It&#x27;s also used as an attractant for catching insect such as walnut husk fly (Rhagoletis completa).

==Reactions==
It dissolves in water to give a mildly alkaline solution. It is insoluble in acetone and alcohols.

Ammonium bicarbonate decomposes above about 36 °C into ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water in an endothermic process and so causes a drop in the temperature of the water:

When treated with acids, ammonium salts are also produced:
Reaction with base produces ammonia.

It reacts with sulfates of alkaline-earth metals precipitating their carbonates:

It also reacts with alkali metal halides, giving alkali metal bicarbonate and ammonium halide:
:

==Natural occurrence==
The compound occurs in nature as an exceedingly rare mineral teschemacherite. It can also be obtained from deer antlers.

==Safety==
Ammonium bicarbonate is an irritant to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Short-term health effects may occur immediately or shortly after exposure to ammonium bicarbonate. Breathing ammonium bicarbonate can irritate the nose, throat and lungs causing coughing, wheezing and/or shortness of breath. Repeated exposure may cause bronchitis to develop with cough, and/or shortness of breath. Health effects can occur some time after exposure to ammonium bicarbonate and can last for months or years.

Where possible, operations should be enclosed and the use of local exhaust ventilation at the site of chemical release is recommended. If local exhaust ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators are necessary. Wear protective work clothing and change clothes and wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to ammonium bicarbonate.

Ammonium bicarbonate from China used to make cookies was found to be contaminated with melamine, and imports were banned in Malaysia following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal.

<doc id="402190" wikidata="Q62288" url="?curid=402190" title="Rolex">
<text>Rolex () is a Swiss watch brand and manufacturer based in Geneva, Switzerland. Founded in 1905 as &quot;Wilsdorf and Davis&quot; by German businessman Hans Wilsdorf and his eventual brother-in-law Alfred Davis in London, the company registered &quot;Rolex&quot; as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became &quot;Rolex Watch Co. Ltd.&quot; in 1915. After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy that led to business instability. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered &quot;Montres Rolex SA&quot; in Geneva as the new company name (&quot;montre&quot; is French for watch); it later became &quot;Rolex SA&quot;. Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.

Rolex SA and its subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, make, distribute, and service wristwatches sold under the Rolex and Tudor brands. In 2023, Rolex agreed to acquire its longtime retail partner Bucherer, and in 2024, Rolex began construction of a new headquarters on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, near Billionaires&#x27; Row.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Alfred Davis and his brother-in-law Hans Wilsdorf founded &quot;Wilsdorf and Davis&quot;, the company that would eventually become &quot;Rolex SA&quot;, in London in 1905. Wilsdorf and Davis&#x27;s main commercial activity at the time involved importing Hermann Aegler&#x27;s Swiss movements to England and placing them in watch cases made by Dennison and others. These early wristwatches were sold to many jewellers, who then put their own names on the dial. The earliest watches from Wilsdorf and Davis were usually hallmarked &quot;W&amp;D&quot; inside the caseback.

In 1908, Wilsdorf registered the trademark &quot;Rolex&quot;, which became the brand name of watches from Wilsdorf and Davis. He opened an office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Wilsdorf wanted the brand name to be easily pronounceable in any language, and short enough to fit on the face of a watch. He also thought that the name &quot;Rolex&quot; was onomatopoeic, sounding like a watch being wound.

During World War I, Rolex manufactured trench watches. In November 1915, the company changed its name to &quot;Rolex Watch Co. Ltd.&quot; In 1919, Hans Wilsdorf moved the company from England to Geneva, Switzerland, because of heavy post-war taxes levied on luxury imports and high export duties on the silver and gold used for the watch cases. In 1919 the company&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Montres Rolex SA&quot; and later in 1920 to &quot;Rolex&quot; SA.

With administrative worries attended to, Wilsdorf turned the company&#x27;s attention to a marketing challenge: the infiltration of dust and moisture under the dial and crown, which damaged the movement. To address this problem, in 1926 a third-party casemaker produced a waterproof and dustproof wristwatch for Rolex, giving it the name &quot;Oyster&quot;. The original patent attributed to Paul Perregaux and Georges Peret, that allowed the watch to be adjusted while maintaining protection from water ingress was purchased by Rolex and heavily marketed. The watch featured a hermetically sealed case which provided optimal protection for the movement.

As a demonstration, Rolex submerged Oyster models in aquariums, which it displayed in the windows of its main points of sale. In 1927, British swimmer Mercedes Gleitze swam the English Channel with an Oyster on her necklace, becoming the first Rolex ambassador. To celebrate the feat, Rolex published a full-page advertisement on the front page of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for every issue for a whole month proclaiming the watch&#x27;s success during the ten-hour-plus swim.

In 1931, Rolex patented a self-winding mechanism called a Perpetual rotor, a semi-circular plate that relies on gravity to move freely. In turn, the Oyster watch became known as the Oyster Perpetual. The invention of the Perpetual rotor by Rolex in 1931 revolutionized the self-winding watch, as watches were previously not allowed to be wound using a semi-circular plate that moved freely with gravity.

Upon the death of his wife in 1944, Wilsdorf established the &quot;Hans Wilsdorf Foundation&quot;, a private trust, in which he left all of his Rolex shares, ensuring that some of the company&#x27;s income would go to charity. Wilsdorf died in 1960, and since then the trust has owned and run Rolex SA.

== Charitable status ==
The Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, which privately owns Rolex SA, is a registered Swiss charitable foundation and pays a lower tax rate. In 2011, a spokesman for Rolex declined to provide evidence regarding the amount of charitable donations made by the Wilsdorf Foundation, which brought up several scandals due to the lack of transparency. In Geneva where the company is based, it is said to have gifted, among many things, two housing buildings to social institutions in Geneva.

== Subsidiaries ==
Rolex SA offers products under the Rolex and Tudor brands. Montres Tudor SA has designed, manufactured and marketed Tudor watches since 6 March 1946. Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf conceived Tudor to create a product for authorized Rolex dealers to sell that offered the reliability and dependability of a Rolex, but at a lower price. The number of Rolex watches was limited by the rate that they could produce in-house Rolex movements, thus Tudor watches were originally equipped with third-party standard movements supplied by ETA SA while using Rolex-quality cases and bracelets. Since 2015, Tudor has begun to manufacture watches with in-house movements. The first model introduced with an in-house movement was the Tudor North Flag. Following this, updated versions of the Tudor Pelagos and Tudor Heritage Black Bay have also been fitted with an in-house caliber.

Tudor watches are marketed and sold in most countries around the world. Montres Tudor SA discontinued sales of Tudor-branded watches in the United States in 2004, but Tudor returned to the United States market in the summer of 2013, and to the UK in 2014.

== Production ==

Each Rolex comes with a unique serial number, which can help indicate its approximate production period. Serial numbers were first introduced in 1926 and were issued sequentially, until 1954, when Rolex restarted from #999,999 to #0. In 1987, there was an addition of one letter to a 6-digit serial number and in 2010, to the present date Rolex introduced random serial numbers.

== Quartz movements ==
While Rolex mostly produces mechanical watches, it also participated in development of the original quartz watch movements. Although Rolex has made very few quartz models for its Oyster line, the company&#x27;s engineers were instrumental in design and implementation of the technology during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1968, Rolex collaborated with a consortium of 16 Swiss watch manufacturers to develop the &quot;Beta 21&quot; quartz movement used in their Rolex &quot;Quartz Date&quot; 5100 alongside other manufactures including the Omega Electroquartz watches. Within about five years of research, design and development, Rolex created the &quot;clean-slate&quot; 5035/5055 movement that would eventually power the Rolex Oysterquartz.

== Materials ==

Material-wise, Rolex first used its &quot;Cerachrom&quot; ceramic bezel on the GMT-Master II in 2005, and has since then implemented ceramic bezel inserts across the range of professional sports watches. They are available on the Submariner, Sea Dweller, Deepsea, GMT Master II and Daytona models. In contrast to the aluminum bezel which it replaced, the ceramic bezel color does not wear out from exposure to UV-light and is scratch resistant.

Rolex uses 904L grade stainless steel; in contrast, most Swiss watches are made with 316L grade steel. Rolex uses the higher grade, as it is more resistant to corrosion and when polished, leaves a more attractive lustre.

== Notable models ==
In general, Rolex has three watch lines: &quot;Oyster Perpetual&quot;, &quot;Professional&quot; and &quot;Cellini&quot; (the Cellini line is Rolex&#x27;s line of &quot;dress&quot; watches). The primary bracelets for the Oyster line are named &quot;Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Oyster&quot;, &quot;President&quot;, and &quot;Pearlmaster&quot;. The watch straps on the models are usually either stainless steel, yellow gold, white gold, rose gold, or platinum. In the United Kingdom, the retail price for the stainless steel &#x27;Pilots&#x27; range (such as the GMT Master II) starts from £9,350. Diamond inlay watches are more expensive. The book &quot;Vintage Wristwatches&quot; by &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;″s Reyne Haines listed a price estimate of vintage Rolex watches that ranged between US$650 and US$75,000, while listing vintage Tudors between US$250 and US$9,000.

=== Air-Kings ===

Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf created the Air-Prince line to honor RAF pilots of the Battle of Britain, releasing the first model in 1958. By 2007, the 1142XX iteration of the Air-King featured a COSC-certified movement in a 34mm case, considered by some a miniaturized variant of the 39mm Rolex Explorer as both watches featured very similar styling cues; the 34mm Air-King lineup was the least expensive series of Oyster Perpetual. In 2014 the Air-King was dropped, making the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 the entry-level Rolex line. In 2016 Rolex reintroduced the Air-King, available as a single model (number 116900), largely similar to its predecessors but with a larger 40mm case, and a magnetic shield found on the Rolex Milgauss; indeed the new 40mm Air-King is slightly cheaper than the 39mm Explorer (the Explorer lacks the magnetic shield but its movement has Paraflex shock absorbers that are not found in the Air-King&#x27;s movement).
=== Oyster Perpetual ===

The name of the watch line in catalogs is often &quot;Rolex Oyster ______&quot; or &quot;Rolex Oyster Perpetual ______&quot;; Rolex Oyster and Oyster Perpetual are generic names and not specific product lines, except for the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39/41 and Oyster Perpetual Date 34. The Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch is a direct descendant of the original watertight Rolex Oyster watch created in 1926.

Within the Oyster Perpetual lineup, there are three different movements; the 39 features the Calibre 3132 movement with the Parachrom hairspring and Paraflex shock absorbers (the Oyster Perpetual 39 is a variant of the Rolex Explorer 39mm, sharing the same case, bracelet and clasp, bezel, and movement, with a different dial and different hands), while the 34 and 36 models have the Caliber 3130 featuring the Parachrom hairspring, and the smallest 28 and 31 models have Calibre 2231. The Oyster Perpetual Date 34 (or simply Date 34) adds a date display and date movement, plus the options of a white gold fluted bezel and diamonds on the dial.

Certain models from the Date and Datejust ranges are almost identical, however the Datejust have 36 mm and 41 mm cases paired with a 20 mm bracelet, compared with the Date&#x27;s 34 mm case and 19 mm bracelet. Modern versions of the Oyster Perpetual Date and Datejust models share Rolex&#x27;s 3135 movement, with the most recent change to the 3135 movement being introduction of Rolex&#x27;s &quot;parachrom bleu&quot; hairspring, which provides increased accuracy. As the Date and Datejust share a movement, both have the ability to adjust the date forward one day at a time without adjusting the time; this feature is not confined to the Datejust. Compared with the Date, the Datejust has a much wider range of customization options, including other metals beyond stainless steel, various materials for the dial, and optional diamonds on the dial and bezel. The Datejust II, which was released in 2009, has a bigger case (41mm diameter) than the standard Datejust and features an updated movement, being only available in steel with white, yellow or rose gold on an Oyster bracelet. In 2016, Rolex released the Datejust 41, which has the same 41mm diameter case as the Datejust II, however the Datejust 41 has smaller indexes and a thinner bezel compared to the Datejust II

=== Professional collections ===
Rolex produced specific models suitable for the extremes of deep-sea diving, caving, mountain climbing, polar exploration, and aviation. Early professional models included the Rolex Submariner (1953) and the Rolex Sea Dweller (1967). The latter watch has a helium release valve to release helium gas build-up during decompression, which, according to Urs Alois Eschle, a former director of Doxa, was patented by Rolex in cooperation with Doxa.

The Explorer (1953) and Explorer II (1971) were developed specifically for explorers who would navigate rough terrain, such as the world-famous Mount Everest expeditions. Indeed, the Rolex Explorer was launched to celebrate the successful ascent of Everest in 1953 by the expeditionary team led by Sir John Hunt. (That expedition was supplied with watches from both Rolex and Smiths; it was a Smiths watch, rather than a Rolex, which Edmund Hillary wore to the summit.)

The 39 mm Rolex Explorer was designed as a &quot;tool watch&quot; for rugged use, hence its movement has Paraflex shock absorbers which give them higher shock resistance than other Rolex watches. The 42mm Rolex Explorer II has some significant differences from the 39mm Explorer; the Explorer II adds a date function, and an orange 24-hour hand which is paired with the fixed bezel&#x27;s black 24-hour markers for situations underground or around the poles where day cannot be distinguished from night.

Another iconic model is the Rolex GMT Master (1955), originally developed at the request of Pan Am Airways to provide its crews with a dual-time watch that could be used to display local time and GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), which was the international time standard for aviation at that time (and still is in its modern variant of Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) or Zulu Time) and was needed for astronavigation (celestial navigation) during longer flights.

=== Most expensive pieces ===

* On 26 October 2017, a Rolex Daytona (Ref. 6239) wristwatch, manufactured in 1968, was sold by Phillips in its New York auction for US$17.75 million. The watch was originally purchased by Joanne Woodward in 1968 and was given by Joanne to her husband Paul Newman as a gift. The auction price set a record at $15.5 million, plus buyer&#x27;s premium of 12.5%, for a final price of $17,752,500 in New York City. As of 2018, it is the most expensive wristwatch and the second most expensive watch ever sold at auction. Notably, &quot;[a]t the time that Newman gave the watch to James Cox [as a gift], the watch was selling for about $200.&quot;
* On 28 May 2018, a Rolex Daytona &quot;Unicorn&quot; Ref. 6265 was sold in auction by Phillips for US$5.937 million in Geneva, making it the second most expensive Rolex timepiece ever sold at auction (as of 2018).
* The most expensive Rolex (in terms of retail price) ever produced by the Rolex factory was the GMT Ice reference 116769TBR with a retail price of US$485,350.

== Sponsorship ==

Since 1976, the Rolex Awards for Enterprise of 100,000 Swiss francs has been awarded; a Young Laureates award of 50,000 was added in 2010. The biennial Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative with a grant of about $41,000 was launched in 2002.

Rolex has been the official timekeeper to the Le Mans 24 Hours motor race since 2001. They also have been Formula 1&#x27;s official timekeeper between 2013-2024. Former Formula 1 driver Jackie Stewart has advertised Rolex since 1968. Others who have done so for some years include Gary Player, Arnold Palmer, Roger Penske, Jean-Claude Killy, and Kiri Te Kanawa. It is also the sponsor of the Rolex International Jumping Riders Club Top 10 Final competition.

Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh had a specially designed experimental Rolex Oyster Perpetual Deep-Sea Special strapped to the outside of their bathyscaphe during the 1960 Challenger Deep dive to a world-record depth of . When James Cameron conducted a similar dive in 2012, a specially designed and manufactured Rolex Oyster Perpetual Sea-Dweller Deep Sea Challenge watch was being &quot;worn&quot; by his submarine&#x27;s robotic arm.

Mercedes Gleitze was the first British woman to swim the English Channel on 7 October 1927. However, as John E. Brozek (author of &quot;The Rolex Report: An Unauthorized Reference Book for the Rolex Enthusiast&quot;) points out in his article &quot;The Vindication Swim, Mercedes Gleitze and Rolex take the plunge&quot;, some doubts were cast on her achievement when a hoaxer claimed to have made a faster swim only four days later. Hence Gleitze attempted a repeat swim with extensive publicity on 21 October, dubbed the &quot;Vindication Swim&quot;. For promotional purposes, Wilsdorf offered her one of the earliest Rolex Oysters if she would wear it during the attempt. After more than 10 hours, in water that was much colder than during her first swim, she was pulled from the sea semi-conscious seven miles short of her goal. Although she did not complete the second crossing, a journalist for &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Having regard to the general conditions, the endurance of Miss Gleitze surprised the doctors, journalists and experts who were present, for it seemed unlikely that she would be able to withstand the cold for so long. It was a good performance.&quot; As she sat in the boat, the same journalist made a discovery and reported it as follows: &quot;Hanging round her neck by a ribbon on this swim, Miss Gleitze carried a small gold watch, which was found this evening to have kept good time throughout.&quot; When examined closely, the watch was found to be dry inside and in perfect condition. One month later, on 24 November 1927, Wilsdorf launched the Rolex Oyster watch in the United Kingdom with a full front page Rolex advertisement in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

== Achievements ==

Among the company&#x27;s notable improvements and innovations are:

* In 1926, Rolex produced the Oyster case. While they claim this was the first reliable waterproof wristwatch case based on a screw-down crown it was not; Depollier&#x27;s case was patented 8 years earlier. To this end, Rolex acquired the Perragaux-Perret screw-down patent, added a clutch and combined the screw-down crown with a threaded case back and bezel. Wilsdorf even had a specially made Rolex watch (the watch was called the &quot;DeepSea&quot;) attached to the side of &quot;Trieste&quot;, which went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. The watch survived and tested as having kept perfect time during its descent and ascent. This was confirmed by a telegram sent to Rolex the following day saying &quot;Am happy to confirm that even at 11,000 metres your watch is as precise as on the surface. Best regards, Jacques Piccard&quot;. Earlier waterproof watches such as the &quot;Submarine Watch&quot; by Tavannes used other means to seal the case.
* In 1910, the first watchmaker to earn chronometer certification for a small lady wristwatch.
* In 1931, released a wristwatch winding mechanism featuring a rotor, a full 360 degrees rotating weight to power the watch by the movement of the wearer&#x27;s arm. As well as making watch winding unnecessary, it also kept the power from the mainspring more consistent, resulting in more reliable timekeeping. Fully rotating weights later became part of the standard winding mechanism of self-winding wristwatches. A preceding self-winding mechanism by Harwood instead used a weight that moved in a 270 degrees arc hitting buffer springs on both sides.
* In 1945, introduced the first chronometer wristwatch with an automatically changing date on the dial (Rolex Datejust Ref. 4467). An earlier wristwatch with a date changing mechanism by Mimo was not chronometer certified.
* In 1953, released a case waterproof to 100 m (330 ft) in the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Submariner Ref. 6204. Although this has been commonly publicized as the first diving watch, in 1932 Omega had released the Marine, which could stand 135mts, 35mts more than the 1953 Rolex Submariner. Blancpain produced their Fifty Fathoms watch in 1953, 10 months before the Rolex Submariner.
* In 1954, produced a wristwatch which showed two time zones at once in the Rolex GMT Master ref. 6542. Yet again, it was not the first company to do so, as the Longines DualTime preceded the GMT by a full quarter of a century.
* In 1956, Rolex made a wristwatch with an automatically changing day and date on the dial in the Rolex Day-Date.

== Cultural impact ==

By the start of World War II, Royal Air Force pilots were buying Rolex watches to replace their inferior standard-issue watches; however, when captured and sent to prisoner of war (POW) camps, their watches were confiscated. When Hans Wilsdorf heard of this, he offered to replace all watches that had been confiscated and not require payment until the end of the war, if the officers would write to Rolex and explain the circumstances of their loss and where they were being held. Wilsdorf was in personal charge of the scheme. As a result of this, an estimated 3,000 Rolex watches were ordered by British officers in the officer camp Oflag VII-B in Bavaria alone. This had the effect of raising the morale among the Allied POWs because it indicated that Wilsdorf did not believe that the Axis powers would win the war. American servicemen heard about this when stationed in Europe during WWII and this helped open up the American market to Rolex after the war.

On 10 March 1943, while still a prisoner of war, Corporal Clive James Nutting, one of the organizers of the Great Escape, ordered a stainless steel Rolex Oyster 3525 Chronograph (valued at a current equivalent of £1,200) by mail directly from Hans Wilsdorf in Geneva, intending to pay for it with money he saved working as a shoemaker at the camp. The watch (Rolex watch no. 185983) was delivered to Stalag Luft III on 10 July that year along with a note from Wilsdorf apologising for any delay in processing the order and explaining that an English gentleman such as Corporal Nutting &quot;should not even think&quot; about paying for the watch before the end of the war. Wilsdorf is reported to have been impressed with Nutting because, although not an officer, he had ordered the expensive Rolex 3525 Oyster chronograph while most other prisoners ordered the much cheaper Rolex Speed King model which was popular because of its small size. The watch is believed to have been ordered specifically to be used in the Great Escape when, as a chronograph, it could have been used to time patrols of prison guards or time the 76 ill-fated escapees through tunnel &#x27;Harry&#x27; on 24 March 1944. Eventually, after the war, Nutting was sent an invoice of only £15 for the watch, because of currency export controls in England at the time. The watch and associated correspondence between Wilsdorf and Nutting were sold at an auction for £66,000 in May 2007, while at an earlier auction in September 2006 the same watch fetched A$54,000. Nutting served as a consultant for both the 1950 film &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; and the 1963 film &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

In an infamous murder case, the Rolex on Ronald Platt&#x27;s wrist eventually led to the arrest of his murderer, Albert Johnson Walker, a financial planner who had fled from Canada when he was charged with 18 counts of fraud, theft and money laundering. When a body was found in the English Channel in 1996 by a fisherman named John Coprik, a Rolex wristwatch was the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex and identified the owner of the watch as Ronald Platt. In addition, police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the watch calendar. Since the Rolex movement was fully waterproof and had a reserve of two days of operation when inactive, police were able to reasonably infer the time of death.

In Singapore on 20 April 1998, a 23-year-old Malaysian named Jonaris Badlishah bludgeoned a 42-year-old beautician Sally Poh Bee Eng to death in order to steal her Rolex and later give it to his girlfriend as a birthday present. The case became known as the &quot;Rolex watch murder&quot;. Jonaris was arrested, sentenced to death and executed.

O. J. Simpson wore a counterfeit Rolex during his 1994 murder trial.

According to the 2017 Brand Z report, the brand value is estimated at $8.053 billion. Rolex watches continue to have a reputation as status symbols. The company produces more than 1,000,000 timepieces each year.

<text>Bomarzo is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the province of Viterbo (Lazio, Central Italy), in the lower valley of the Tiber. It is located east-northeast of Viterbo and north-northwest of Rome.

== History ==
The city&#x27;s current name is a derivation of &quot;Polymartium&quot;, first mentioned in the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; by Paulus Diaconus. The etymology &quot;polis martium&quot;, city of Mars, suggests a Roman origin. However, archeological evidence for a Roman city has not been found so far. However, a Roman brickmaking factory established nearby may have been owned by Domitia Calvilla, the mother of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. 

It was a historical fiefdom of the Orsini family, whose castle is at the edge of the densely built town, until it was sold to Ippolito Lante Montefeltro della Rovere in 1645. Lante was elevated to the title of &quot;Duke of Bomarzo&quot;. 
== Main sights ==

Bomarzo&#x27;s main attraction is a garden, usually referred to as the &quot;Bosco Sacro&quot; (Sacred grove) or, locally, &quot;Bosco dei Mostri&quot; (&quot;Monsters&#x27; Grove&quot;), named after the many larger-than-life sculptures, some sculpted in the bedrock, which populate this predominantly barren landscape. 

It is the work of Pier Francesco Orsini, called &quot;Vicino&quot; (1528–1588), a condottiero or mercenary and a patron of the arts. He was greatly devoted to his wife Giulia Farnese, daughter of Galeazzo Farnese, Duke of Latera, (not to be confused with her maternal great-aunt Giulia Farnese) and when she died, he created the gardens. The design has been attributed to Pirro Ligorio, a well known architect and antiquarian of the time.

The park of Bomarzo was intended not to please, but to astonish, and like many Mannerist works of art, its symbolism is arcane; for example, one large sculpture is of one of Hannibal&#x27;s war elephants, which mangles a Roman legionary, and another is a statue of Ceres lounging on the bare ground, with a vase of &quot;fruits of the earth&quot; perched on her head.

The many monstrous statues appear to be unconnected to any rational plan and appear to have been strewn almost randomly about the area, &quot;sol per sfogare il Core&quot; (&quot;just to set the heart free&quot;) as one inscription on an obelisk says.

Enigmatic verses in Italian by Annibale Caro, Bitussi and Cristoforo Madruzzo, some of them now eroded, were inscribed onto stone beside the sculptures.

The reason for the layout and design of the garden is largely unknown: perhaps they were meant as a foil to the perfect symmetry and layout of the great Renaissance gardens nearby at Villa Farnese at Caprarola and Villa Lante at Bagnaia. Next to a formal exedra is a tilting building, the so-called &quot;Casa Storta&quot; or Twisted House.

A small octagonal temple was added about twenty years later to honor Orsini&#x27;s wife, Giulia Farnese.

During the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, the garden became overgrown and neglected but in the 1970s a program of restoration was implemented by the Bettini family, and today the garden, which remains private property, is a major tourist attraction. In recent years, a number of the stone sculptures have had fences put around them.

The surreal nature of the Parco dei Mostri appealed to Jean Cocteau and the great surrealist Salvador Dalí, who discussed it at great length. The poet André Pieyre de Mandiargues wrote an essay devoted to Bomarzo. Niki de Saint Phalle was inspired by Bomarzo when she created her &quot;Tarot Garden&quot; in Tuscany. The story behind Bomarzo and the life of Pier Francesco Orsini are the subject of a novel by the Argentinian writer Manuel Mujica Láinez (1910–1984), &quot;Bomarzo&quot; (1962). Mujica Láinez himself wrote a libretto based on his novel, which was set to music by Alberto Ginastera (1967). The opera &quot;Bomarzo&quot; premièred in Washington in 1967 but in Argentina it was banned by the military dictatorship. The Dutch magic-surrealist painter Carel Willink used several of the park&#x27;s statue groups in his paintings, including &quot;The Eternal Cry&quot; and &quot;Balance of Forces&quot;. A mystery novel by Linda Lappin, &quot;Signatures in Stone&quot; (2013), investigates the symbolism of the Sacred Grove, its relation to the myth of Persephone, and recent theories concerning the designer of the park.

<text>Izanagi (イザナギ/伊邪那岐/伊弉諾) or Izanaki (イザナキ), formally referred to with a divine honorific as
, is the creator deity (&quot;kami&quot;) of both creation and life in Japanese mythology. He and his sister-wife Izanami are the last of the seven generations of primordial deities that manifested after the formation of heaven and earth. Izanagi and Izanami are held to be the creators of the Japanese archipelago and the progenitors of many deities, which include the sun goddess Amaterasu, the moon deity Tsukuyomi, and the storm god Susanoo. He is a god that can be said to be the beginning of the current Japanese imperial family.

==Name==
His name is given in the () both as &quot;Izanagi-no-Kami&quot; (伊邪那岐神) and &quot;Izanagi-no-Mikoto&quot; (伊邪那岐命), while the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (720 AD) refers to him as &quot;Izanagi-no-Mikoto&quot;, with the name written in different characters (伊弉諾尊).

The names &quot;Izanagi&quot; (&quot;Izanaki&quot;) and &quot;Izanami&quot; are often interpreted as being derived from the verb (historical orthography ) or &quot;iⁿzanap&quot;- from Western Old Japanese &#x27;to invite&#x27;, with &quot;-ki&quot; / &quot;-gi&quot; and &quot;-mi&quot; being taken as masculine and feminine suffixes, respectively. The literal translation of Iⁿzanaŋgî and Iⁿzanamî are &#x27;Male-who-invites&#x27; and &#x27;Female-who-invites&#x27;. 
Shiratori Kurakichi proposed an alternative theory which instead sees the root &quot;iza-&quot; (or rather &quot;isa-&quot;) to be derived from &quot;isao&quot; (historical orthography: &quot;isawo&quot;) meaning &#x27;achievement&#x27; or &#x27;merit&#x27;.
The etymological origin of the verb is suggested to be a precursor to the Middle Korean lemma &quot;yènc&quot;- meaning &#x27;to place/put on [the top of]&#x27; reconstructed as &quot;*yenc-a&quot; (place-INF) in Old Korean.

==Mythology==

===In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;===
====The birth of the land====

The portrays Izanagi and his younger twin sister Izanami as the seventh and final generation of deities that manifested after the emergence of the first group of gods, the Kotoamatsukami, when heaven and Earth came into existence.

Receiving a command from the other gods to solidify and shape the Earth (which then &quot;[resembled] floating oil and [drifted] like a jellyfish&quot;), the couple use a jewelled spear to churn the watery chaos. The brine that dripped from the tip of the spear congealed and turned into an island named Onogoro (淤能碁呂島). The two descended to the island and, setting up their dwelling, erected a &#x27;heavenly pillar&#x27; (&quot;ama no mihashira&quot;) on it. Izanagi and Izanami, realizing that they were meant to procreate and have children, then devised a marriage ceremony whereby they would walk in opposite directions around the pillar, greet each other and initiate intercourse. After Izanami greeted Izanagi first, Izanagi objected that he, the man, should have been the first to speak. True enough, the first offspring that resulted from their union, the &#x27;leech-child&#x27; Hiruko, was considered imperfect and set adrift on a boat of reeds. Izanagi and Izanami then also begat the island of Awa (淡島 &quot;Awashima&quot;), but this too was not counted among their rightful progeny.
Izanagi and Izanami then decided to repeat the ritual, with Izanagi greeting Izanami first. This time, their union was a success, with Izanami giving birth to some of the various islands that comprise the Japanese archipelago (with the notable exceptions of Shikoku and Hokkaido), which include the following eight islands (in the following order):

*Awaji-no-Ho-no-Sawake (淡道之穂之狭別島)
*The double-named island of Iyo (伊予之二名島 &quot;Iyo-no-Futana-no-Shima&quot;, modern Shikoku)
*The triple islands of Oki (隠伎之三子島 &quot;Oki-no-Mitsugo-no-Shima&quot;)
*Tsukushi (筑紫島, modern Kyushu)
*Iki (伊伎島)
*Tsushima (津島)
*Sado (佐度島)
*Ōyamato-Toyoakitsushima (大倭豊秋津島, modern Honshu)

The two then proceeded to beget the various deities who are to inhabit these lands. Izanami, however, was badly injured and eventually died after giving birth to the fire god Kagutsuchi. In an act of grief and rage, Izanagi killed Kagutsuchi with his &#x27;ten-grasp sword&#x27;. More gods manifest into existence out of Izanami&#x27;s excreta, Kagutsuchi&#x27;s blood and mutilated remains, and Izanagi&#x27;s tears.

====Descent into Yomi====
Izanagi, wishing to see Izanami again, went down to Yomi, the land of the dead, in the hopes of retrieving her. Izanami reveals that she had already partaken of food cooked in the furnace of the underworld, rendering her return impossible. Izanagi, losing his patience, betrayed his promise not to look at her and lit up a fire, only to find that Izanami is now a rotting corpse. To avenge her shame, Izanami dispatched the gods of thunder (known as the Yakusanoikazuchi), the &quot;hags of Yomi&quot; (予母都志許売 &quot;Yomotsu-shikome&quot;), and a horde of warriors to chase after him. To distract them, Izanagi threw the vine securing his hair and the comb on his right hair-knot, which turned into grapes and bamboo shoots that the hags devoured. Upon reaching the pass of Yomotsu Hirasaka (黄泉比良坂, the &#x27;Flat Slope of Yomi&#x27;), Izanagi took three peaches from a nearby tree and repelled his pursuers using them. He then declared the peach fruit to be divine and bade it to grow in the land of the living to help people in need. When Izanami herself came in pursuit of him, Izanagi sealed the entrance to Yomi using a huge boulder. Izanami then pronounced a curse, vowing to kill a thousand people each day, to which Izanagi replies that he would then beget a thousand and five hundred people everyday to thwart her.

====Purification (&quot;Misogi&quot;)====

Izanagi, feeling contaminated by his visit to Yomi, went to &quot;[the plain of] Awagihara (i.e. a plain covered with &quot;awagi&quot;) by the river-mouth of Tachibana in Himuka in [the island of] Tsukushi&quot; and purified himself by bathing in the river; various deities came into existence as he stripped off his clothes and accouterments and immersed himself in the water. The three most important &quot;kami&quot;, the &quot;Three Precious Children&quot; (三貴子 or ) – the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami, the moon deity Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto, and the storm god Susanoo-no-Mikoto – were born when Izanagi washed his left eye, his right eye, and his nose, respectively.

====Izanagi and Susanoo====

Izanagi divides the world among his three children: Amaterasu was allotted Takamagahara (高天原, the &quot;Plain of High Heaven&quot;), Tsukuyomi the night, and Susanoo the seas. Susanoo did not perform his appointed task and instead kept crying and howling &quot;until his beard eight hands long extended down over his chest,&quot; causing the mountains to wither and the rivers to dry up. After he told his father that he wished to go to his mother&#x27;s land, Ne-no-Katasu-Kuni (根堅州国, the &#x27;Land of Roots&#x27;), a furious Izanagi expelled Susanoo &quot;with a divine expulsion,&quot; after which he disappears from the narrative.

===In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;===
While the first generations of &quot;kami&quot; including Izanagi and Izanami are implied in the and the &#x27;s main narrative to have manifested independent of each other, one variant cited in the &quot;Shoki&quot; instead describes them as the offspring of Aokashikine-no-Mikoto (青橿城根尊), another name for the goddess Ayakashikone-no-Mikoto, of the sixth of the first seven generations of gods. Another variant meanwhile portrays Izanagi as the offspring of a deity named Awanagi-no-Mikoto (沫蕩尊) and the fifth-generation descendant of the primordial deity Kuninotokotachi-no-Mikoto.

In the &quot;Shoki&quot;&#x27;s main narrative, the couple first begets the following eight islands after performing the marriage ceremony (in the following order):

*Awaji (淡路洲), which &quot;was reckoned as the placenta, and their minds took no pleasure in it&quot;
*Ōyamato-Toyoakitsushima (大日本豊秋津洲)
*The double-named island of Iyo (伊豫二名洲)
*Tsukushi (筑紫洲)
*Oki (億岐洲) and Sado (佐度洲), born as twins
*Koshi (越洲), what is now known as the Hokuriku region
*Ōshima (大洲), identified with the island of Suō-Ōshima in Yamaguchi Prefecture
*Kibi-no-Kojima (吉備子洲), identified with the Kojima Peninsula in southern Okayama Prefecture (formerly the province of Kibi)

Both Ōshima and Kibi-no-Kojima are not reckoned among the eight great islands in the , instead being identified as being born after them. The other remaining islands, such as Tsushima (対馬島) and Iki (壱岐島), are said to have been produced by the coagulation of the foam in sea water (or freshwater).

<doc id="402205" wikidata="Q1231142" url="?curid=402205" title="Fear (band)">
<text>Fear, stylized as FEAR, is an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1977. The band is credited for helping to shape the sound and style of Californian hardcore punk. The group gained national prominence after an infamous 1981 performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Frontman Lee Ving has been the band&#x27;s only constant member. Since its formation, the band has gone through various lineup changes, and at one point featured Flea, later a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, on bass. The classic Fear lineup existed from 1978 to 1982, and was composed of Ving, guitarist Philo Cramer, bassist Derf Scratch, and drummer Spit Stix. Cramer and Stix later rejoined the band in 2018.

==History==
===1970s===
Fear was formed in 1977 by singer/guitarist Lee Ving and bassist Derf Scratch, who recruited guitarist Burt Good and drummer Johnny Backbeat. According to Scratch, the band was named by photographer Bob Seidemann. In 1978, Fear released the single &quot;I Love Livin&#x27; in the City&quot;. Shortly after this, Good and Backbeat left the band and were replaced by Philo Cramer and Spit Stix.

===1980s===
Film director Penelope Spheeris met Ving and Stix while they were hanging handbills on telephone poles in Los Angeles on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. After a brief discussion, she asked if they wanted to be in a documentary about the Los Angeles punk scene, &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; (1981). In the film, Fear performed a set in which they baited members of the audience with personal attacks, sexist and homophobic slurs, and offbeat humor, inspiring some audience members to come on stage to fight them. At the time, Spheeris was married to Slash Records president Bob Biggs who, later that year, signed a recording deal with Fear.

Actor John Belushi, who became a fan of the band through an episode of L.A.-based &quot;New Wave Theatre&quot; in 1980, successfully lobbied to get the band a spot as a musical guest on the 1981 Halloween episode of his former show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Belushi had originally offered Fear a song on the soundtrack for his final motion picture &quot;Neighbors&quot;. The film&#x27;s producers eventually forced Fear off the project, and Belushi got them the infamous &quot;SNL&quot; gig as compensation. The band&#x27;s appearance included a group of slamdancers, among them Belushi, Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat and Fugazi, Tesco Vee of the Meatmen, Harley Flanagan and John Joseph of the Cro-Mags, and John Brannon of Negative Approach. The show&#x27;s director originally wanted to prevent the dancers from participating, so Belushi offered to be in the episode if the dancers were allowed to stay. The end result was the shortening of Fear&#x27;s appearance on TV. Fear played &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care About You&quot;, &quot;Beef Bologna&quot;, &quot;New York&#x27;s Alright If You Like Saxophones&quot;, and started to play &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a War&quot; when the telecast faded into commercial. They ended &quot;Beef Bologna&quot; by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s great to be in New Jersey&quot;, drawing boos from the New York live audience. The slamdancers left ripe pumpkin remains on the set. Cameras, a piano and other property were damaged. After their &quot;SNL&quot; appearance, which resulted in $20,000 in damage, some clubs chose not to hire the band. The song originally recorded for the film, also titled &quot;Neighbors&quot;, featured vocals from Belushi and Ving, and was eventually released by Ving in 2015.

Fear also appeared in the 1981 rotoscope animated film &quot;American Pop&quot;, directed by Ralph Bakshi. Ving performed under the name Lee James Jude.

Additionally that year, Josie Cotton released the hit song &quot;Johnny Are You Queer?&quot;. The song was based on Fear&#x27;s song &quot;Fetch Me One More Beer&quot;, written by Philo Cramer and John Clancy. Bobby and Larson Paine, who were managing the Go-Go&#x27;s, re-worked the song with new lyrics and gave it to them, but after a falling out forbade the band from playing it and gave it to Cotton. In several interviews Cotton has suggested that the song&#x27;s title was lifted from lyrics in the Fear song, though she has also stated that Fear&#x27;s version of it went &quot;You&#x27;re a fuckin&#x27; queer&quot;, which is consistent with Fear&#x27;s demo of the song.

When Fear found out a variation of their song had become popular, a meeting regarding the publishing rights of the song was arranged between them and the Paines. The two sides decided the winner of a coin toss would get the publishing rights to the song, which the Paines won.

In 1982, Fear released their debut album &quot;The Record&quot;. After touring in support of the album, Ving fired Scratch, which Scratch later claimed was due to jealousy and Ving taking extra payments without the band&#x27;s knowledge. Eric Feldman (of Captain Beefheart, Pere Ubu, and later PJ Harvey and Frank Black) briefly filled in on bass before he was replaced by Flea. Flea left the band and was replaced by Lorenzo Buhne. On July 3, 1983, Fear performed at the &quot;Rock Against Reagan&quot; protest concert at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. along with the Dead Kennedys, MDC, Toxic Reasons, the Crucifucks and others. In the summer of 1983 through early 1984, while Stix was touring Europe with Nina Hagen, Chuck Biscuits was supposed to replace him, but Stix returned and Biscuits never played any shows with Fear. With Ving producing, the band recorded their second album &quot;More Beer&quot; in 1985 in just two days, according to the band. However, according to a representative from Enigma Records, it took a full year, as quoted in a March 1986 issue of &quot;Spin&quot;.

===1990s===
&quot;Live...For the Record&quot;, a live album of a 1985 performance for Spin Radio, was released in 1991. Shortly afterwards, bassist Will &quot;Sluggo&quot; MacGregor was hired. After 1991–93 North American tours, Fear disbanded. Cramer and Stix left the band, citing disputes with Ving over finances. For the next two years, Ving performed in Austin, Texas as Lee Ving&#x27;s Army. This eventually became the new Fear lineup, including Ving backed by LVA members Sean Cruse (guitar), Scott Thunes (bass) and Andrew Jaimez (drums). In 1995, Fear released the &quot;Have Another Beer with Fear&quot; album, followed by &quot;American Beer&quot; (2000), which featured Ving and Jaimez along with new members Richard Presley and Mando Lopez. The album included new recordings of several previously unreleased older Fear songs, as well as some new compositions. Presley and Lopez then began playing with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal in the Breeders.

===2000–present===
Fear (with Ving as the only original member) performed in the annual Warped Tour in 2008. Former bassist Scratch died from liver disease on July 28, 2010. He was 58 years old.

Fear played the South by Southwest festival in 2012. A re-recording of 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Record&quot; was released in late 2012, under the title of &quot;The Fear Record&quot;. In 2018, the band reunited with Cramer and Stix, and added former AFI bassist Geoff Kresge and Henchmen guitarist Eric Razo to the lineup. In the spring of 2022, Fear announced that they had regained the master rights of &quot;The Record&quot; from Warner Music and announced a 40th anniversary deluxe edition of the album.

Fear went on tour throughout 2023. On October 31st, 2023 Fear released the album &quot;For Right and Order&quot;. It was their first new studio album in 11 years (and first new studio album of original material in 23 years). The lineup consisted of Ving, Stix, Kresge, and Razo, in addition to songwriting contributions from Cramer.

<text>The American Plastics Council (APC) is a defunct trade association for the U.S. plastics industry. Through a variety of outreach efforts, APC worked to promote the benefits of plastics and the plastics industry. APC comprised 22 of the leading resin manufacturers, plus one affiliated trade association representing the vinyl industry. APC&#x27;s membership represented more than 80 percent of the U.S. monomer and polymer production and distribution capacity.

Initially autonomous, the APC merged in 2002 with the American Chemistry Council (ACC, formerly known as the Manufacturing Chemists&#x27; Association, then the Chemical Manufacturers Association, renamed ACC in June 2000).
Members are now represented by the ACC.

<text>The seventh USS &quot;Ranger&quot; (CV/CVA-61) was the third of four supercarriers built for the United States Navy in the 1950s. Although all four ships of the class were completed with angled decks, &quot;Ranger&quot; had the distinction of being the first US carrier built from the beginning as an angled-deck ship.

Commissioned in 1957, she served extensively in the Pacific, especially the Vietnam War, for which she earned 13 battle stars. Near the end of her career, she also served in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf.

&quot;Ranger&quot; was decommissioned in 1993, and was stored at Bremerton, Washington until March 2015. She was then moved to Brownsville for scrapping, which was completed in November 2017.

== Construction and trials ==
&quot;Ranger&quot; was the first American aircraft carrier to be laid down as an angled-deck ship (her elder sisters &quot;Forrestal&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; had been laid down as axial-deck ships and were converted for an angled deck while under construction). She was laid down 2 August 1954 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Newport News, Virginia in Shipway 10. Her partially completed hull was floated and placed in Shipway 11 four months later for final completion. &quot;Ranger&quot; was launched 29 September 1956, sponsored by Mrs. Arthur Radford (wife of Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and commissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard 10 August 1957, Captain Charles T. Booth II in command.

&quot;Ranger&quot; joined the U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 3 October 1957. Just prior to sailing on 4 October for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for shakedown, she received the men and planes of Attack Squadron 85. She conducted air operations, individual ship exercises, and final acceptance trials along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean Sea until 20 June 1958. Noted artist Jack Coggins was commissioned by the United States Naval Institute to paint the new aircraft carrier; his artwork appeared on the cover of their Proceedings Magazine of July 1958. She then departed Norfolk, Virginia, with 200 Naval Reserve officer candidates for a two-month cruise that took the carrier around Cape Horn. She arrived at her new homeport, Naval Air Station Alameda, Alameda, California, on 20 August and joined the Pacific Fleet.

== Service ==

The carrier spent the remainder of 1958 in pilot qualification training for Air Group 14 and fleet exercises along the California coast. Departing 3 January 1959 for final training in Hawaiian waters until 17 February, she next sailed as the flagship of Rear Admiral Henry H. Caldwell, Commander, Carrier Division Two, to join the Seventh Fleet. Air operations off Okinawa were followed by maneuvers with SEATO naval units out of Subic Bay, Philippines. A special weapons warfare exercise and a patrol along the southern seaboard of Japan followed. During this first WestPac deployment, &quot;Ranger&quot; launched more than 7,000 sorties in support of 7th Fleet operations. She returned to San Francisco Bay 27 July. During the next 6 months, &quot;Ranger&quot; was kept in a high state of readiness through participation in exercises and coastal fleet operations.

With Carrier Air Group 9 embarked, she departed Alameda on 6 February 1960 for a second WestPac deployment and returned to Alameda 30 August. From 11 August 1961 through 8 March 1962, &quot;Ranger&quot; deployed to the Far East a third time.

The next seven months were filled with intensive training along the western seaboard in preparation for operations in Southeast Asia. &quot;Ranger&quot; departed Alameda on 9 November for brief operations off Hawaii, thence proceeded, via Okinawa, to the Philippines. She steamed to the South China Sea 1 May 1963 to support possible Laotian operations. When the political situation in Laos relaxed 4 May, she resumed her operations schedule with the 7th Fleet. Arriving at Alameda from the Far East 14 June 1963, she underwent overhaul in the San Francisco Naval Shipyard 7 August 1963 through 10 February 1964. Refresher training out of Alameda commenced 25 March, interrupted by an operational cruise to Hawaii from 19 June to 10 July.

In May 1964, &quot;Ranger&quot; was deployed near French Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean to monitor the French nuclear tests on Moruroa, a task made possible by launching and recovering a Lockheed U-2 from its flight deck. Work on modifying the U-2 for carrier landing and take-off started in late 1963, and one accident occurred during the carrier landing operation when the aircraft piloted by test pilot Bob Schumacher crashed.

===Vietnam War service===
&quot;Ranger&quot; again sailed for the Far East on 6 August 1964. This deployment came on the heels of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. &quot;Ranger&quot; made only an eight-hour stop in Pearl Harbor on 10 August, then hurried on to Subic Bay, then to Yokosuka, Japan. In the latter port on 17 October 1964, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Miller, who commanded Fast Carrier Task Force 77. In the following months, she helped the 7th Fleet continue its role of steady watchfulness to keep sea lanes open and stop Communist infiltration by sea.

General William Westmoreland, commanding Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, visited &quot;Ranger&quot; on 9 March 1965 to confer with Rear Admiral Miller. &quot;Ranger&quot; continued air strikes on enemy targets inland until 13 April when a fuel line broke, ignited and engulfed her No. 1 main machinery room in flames. The fire was extinguished in little over an hour. There was one fatality. She put into Subic Bay 15 April and sailed on the 20th for Alameda, arriving home on 6 May. She entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard 13 May and remained there under overhaul until 30 September 1965.

Following refresher training, &quot;Ranger&quot; departed Alameda on 10 December 1965 to rejoin the 7th Fleet. She and her embarked Carrier Air Wing 14 received the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service during combat operations in Southeast Asia from 10 January to 6 August 1966.

&quot;Ranger&quot; departed the Gulf of Tonkin on 6 August for Subic Bay, then steamed via Yokosuka for Alameda, arriving on the 25th. She stood out of San Francisco Bay 28 September and entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard two days later for overhaul. The carrier departed Puget Sound on 30 May 1967 for training out of San Diego and Alameda. On 21 July 1967, she logged her 88,000th carrier landing.

From June until November, &quot;Ranger&quot; underwent a long and intensive period of training designed to make her fully combat ready. Attack Carrier Air Wing 2 (CVW-2) embarked on 15 September 1967, with the new A-7 Corsair II jet attack plane and the UH-2C Seasprite rescue helicopter, making &quot;Ranger&quot; the first carrier to deploy with these powerful new aircraft. From carrier refresher training for CVW-2, &quot;Ranger&quot; proceeded to fleet exercise &quot;Moon Festival&quot;. From 9 to 16 October, the carrier and her air wing participated in every aspect of a major fleet combat operation.

&quot;Ranger&quot; departed Alameda on 4 November 1967 for WestPac. Arriving at Yokosuka on 21 November, she relieved and sailed for the Philippines on the 24th. After arriving at Subic Bay on 29 November, she made final preparations for combat operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. The Commander, Carrier Division 3, embarked on 30 November as Commander, TG 77.7, and &quot;Ranger&quot; departed Subic Bay on 1 December for Yankee Station.

Arriving on station on 3 December 1967, &quot;Ranger&quot; commenced another period of sustained combat operations against North Vietnam. During the next five months, her planes hit a wide variety of targets, including ferries, bridges, airfields, and military installations. Truck parks, rail facilities, antiaircraft guns, and SAM sites were also treated to doses of Air Wing 2&#x27;s firepower. Bob Hope&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Show&quot; came to &quot;Ranger&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin on 21 December. Another welcome break in the intense pace of operations came with a call at Yokosuka during the first week of April. Returning to Yankee Station on 11 April, &quot;Ranger&quot; again struck objectives in North Vietnam.

At the end of January 1968, was seized by North Korea. &quot;Ranger&quot; turned north and proceeded at full speed from the tropical waters off Vietnam to the frigid waters off North Korea as part of Operation Formation Star. The ship had been on the combat line in Vietnam for one month and was due to for rest and recreation. At the conclusion of the North Korea deployment, the ship had been at sea for 65 days. The carrier stopped at the small Japanese port of Sasebo for several days, then proceeded back to combat operations.

After five months of intensive operations, &quot;Ranger&quot; called at Hong Kong on 5 May 1968 and then steamed for home. There followed a shipyard availability at Puget Sound that ended with &quot;Ranger&quot;″s departure 29 July for San Francisco. Three months of leave, upkeep and training culminated in another WestPac deployment 26 October 1968 through 17 May 1969.
She departed Alameda on yet another WestPac deployment in October 1969 as the flagship for Rear Admiral J.C. Donaldson, Commander, Carrier Division Three, and Captain J.P. Moorer as commanding officer, and remained so employed until 18 May 1970. During this time, the ship spent at least two extended periods on Yankee Station, the longest being 45 days, due to mechanical problems with the carrier that was to relieve her. A pleasant break in the lives of &quot;Ranger&quot;″s crew came with the arrival of the Bob Hope show on 24 December 1969. Upon leaving Yankee after one tour and on the way to Sasebo, &quot;Ranger&quot; was ordered to stand off the coast of Korea for three days due to North Korea forcing down a US C-130 and holding the crew. Initially, &quot;Ranger&quot; was to leave the line on Yankee Station for a week of R&amp;R in Subic Bay while offloading supplies, then to Japan and on to Australia and home. A day before &quot;Ranger&quot; was to leave the line she was ordered to hold on station and fly the first sorties on Cambodia. Finally leaving Yankee Station, &quot;Ranger&quot; made a fast three-day offload in Subic Bay and a two-day port call in Sasebo and back to Alameda, arriving 1 June. &quot;Ranger&quot; spent the rest of the summer engaged in operations off the west coast, departing for her sixth WestPac cruise in late October 1970. On 10 March 1971, &quot;Ranger&quot;, along with , set a record of 233 strike sorties for one day in action against North Vietnam. During April, the three carriers assigned to Task Force 77 – &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, and – provided a constant two-carrier posture on Yankee Station. Hours of employment remained unchanged, with one carrier on daylight hours and one on the noon to midnight schedule. Strike emphasis was placed on the interdiction of major Laotian entry corridors to South Vietnam. She returned to Alameda 7 June 1971, and remained in port for the rest of 1971 and the first five months of 1972 undergoing regular overhaul.

On 27 May 1972, she returned to West Coast operation until 16 November, when she embarked upon her seventh WestPac deployment. This had been delayed four months when one of the engines was disabled after Navy fireman E-3 Patrick Chenoweth was accused of dropping a heavy paint scraper into a main reduction gear, one of around two dozen acts of sabotage &quot;Ranger&quot; suffered between 7 June 1972 and 16 October 1972. Chenoweth was charged with &quot;sabotage in time of war&quot;, and faced 30 years imprisonment, but was acquitted by a general court-martial.
On 18 December 1972, the Linebacker II campaign was initiated when negotiations in the Paris peace talks stalemated. Participating carriers were &quot;Ranger&quot;, , , , and . In an intensified version of Operation Linebacker, bombing of North Vietnam above the 20th parallel and reseeding of the mine fields were resumed, and concentrated strikes were carried out against surface-to-air missile and antiaircraft artillery sites, enemy army barracks, petroleum storage areas, Haiphong naval and shipyard areas, and railroad and truck stations. Navy tactical air attack sorties were centered in the coastal areas around Hanoi and Haiphong, with 505 Navy sorties were carried out in this area. These operations ended on 29 December when the North Vietnamese returned to the peace table; on 27 January 1973, the Vietnam cease-fire came into effect, and &quot;Oriskany&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;Ranger&quot;, on Yankee Station, cancelled all combat sorties.

===Post-war service in the 1970s===
&quot;Ranger&quot; returned to Alameda in August 1973. She was ordered immediately to refit and repair at Long Beach Naval Base where she was prepared for her next WESPAC Cruise over the next ninety days. Her air wing was lifted aboard by giant crane in Long Beach. She spent two weeks shaking down active duty and Reserve pilots. She returned to Alameda. There were two more two-week shake down cruises between January and April 1974. On 7 May 1974 she deployed again to the western Pacific. During this cruise, &quot;Ranger&quot; was again deployed to Yankee Station to participate in operations significant to the withdrawal of forces involved there. She returned to homeport on 18 October. On 28 May 1976, while on deployment, helicopter crews from HS-4 aboard &quot;Ranger&quot;, detachments from HC-3 on , and , and helicopters from Naval Air Station Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines, assisted in Philippine disaster relief efforts in the flood ravaged areas of central Luzon. Over 1,900 people were evacuated; more than of relief supplies and of fuel were provided by Navy and Air Force helicopters.
On 12 July 1976, &quot;Ranger&quot; and her escort ships of Task Force 77.7 entered the Indian Ocean and were assigned to operate off the coast of Kenya in response to a threat of military action in Kenya by Ugandan forces in the wake of the rescue of Israeli hostages held at Entebbe Airport in Uganda several days before.

In February 1977, &quot;Ranger&quot; departed Naval Air Station North Island for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, for major overhaul. While in overhaul, she received significant technological upgrades to her command information systems and flight deck gear, and was fitted with Sea Sparrow missile defense systems. Additionally, the main machinery spaces were refitted with more reliable &#x27;General Regulator&#x27; forced-balance automatic boiler and combustion-control systems. In March 1978, the overhaul was completed and she began several months of shakedown cruises and sea trials for recertifications.

On 21 February 1979, &quot;Ranger&quot; deployed for her 14th WestPac cruise, tentatively scheduled to cross the Indian Ocean to present a show of force during the strife between North and South Yemen, a mission she would not complete. On 5 April 1979, she collided with the Liberian-flagged tanker MV &quot;Fortune&quot; just southeast of Singapore while entering the Straits of Malacca. While the large oil tanker was severely damaged, &quot;Ranger&quot; endured a significant gash in her bow, rendering two fuel tanks unusable. &quot;Ranger&quot; turned back to Subic Bay, for temporary repairs and then to Yokosuka, for full repair. The collision resulted in 10,000 tons of crude oil spilled in the South China Sea. MV &quot;Fortune&quot; was hauling 100,000 tons of light crude from Kuwait to Japan.

===1980s===

In September 1980, &quot;Ranger&quot; departed her homeport of San Diego for the 15th WestPac cruise and again crossed into the Indian Ocean via the Straits of Malacca, this time without incident. &quot;Ranger&quot; proceeded to GONZO Station to continue the US Navy&#x27;s show of force in the region during Iran hostage crisis, which at that point was in its tenth month. &quot;Ranger&quot; remained on-station for over 120 days, during which time the hostages were released on 20 January 1981, the 444th day of the crisis. &quot;Ranger&quot; was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal, for both the ship and her company. She returned to homeport on 5 May 1981.

On 20 March 1981, under the command of CAPT Dan Pedersen, &quot;Ranger&quot; rescued 138 Vietnamese boat people from the South China Sea and brought them to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Manila, Philippines. In the same year, following the refugee rescue in 1981, Pedersen was given a nonpunitive letter of censure by Vice Adm. Robert F. Schoultz, commander of the Naval Air Force, United States Pacific Fleet, (COMNAVAIRPAC), after a three-week investigation into the 14 April 1981 death of Airman Paul Trerice, 20 years old, of Algonac, Michigan. Trerice had died after being on a bread-and-water diet for three days, then taking part in punitive exercises in the correctional custody unit. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Trerice became abusive in the Ranger&#x27;s correctional custody unit and had to be subdued in a struggle shortly before his death.&quot; The ship was just completing a successful WestPAC/Indian Ocean deployment and was at Subic Bay at the time. The Navy reported the airman faced disciplinary action for leaving his post and for leaving the ship twice without permission in Hong Kong.

A federal court dismissed criminal charges brought by the Trerice family against Pedersen and other officers on the &quot;Ranger&quot;, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal.

On 26 February 1983, she received an official visit from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who were on a West Coast tour to visit San Diego.

&quot;Ranger&quot; entered the history books on 21 March 1983 when an all-woman flight crew flying a C-1A Trader from VRC-40 &quot;Truckin&#x27; Traders&quot; landed aboard the carrier. The aircraft was commanded by LT Elizabeth M. Toedt and the crew included LTJG Cheryl A. Martin, Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate 3rd Class Gina Greterman, and Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate Airman Robin Banks.

On 1 November 1983, a fire broke out in #4 Main Machinery Room due to a fuel spill during fuel transfer operations while &quot;Ranger&quot; was deployed in the North Arabian Sea east of Oman. Six crewmen were killed as a result of the fire, which knocked out one of the ship&#x27;s four engines and disabled one of her four shafts.&quot;Ranger&quot; returned to the Philippines after 121 consecutive days at sea. One enlisted man was imprisoned for two months of a three-month sentence for dereliction of duty relating to the fire, but the Navy released him early and reprimanded four officers after an investigation in 1984. The report blamed the fire, which resulted in $1.7 million ($ today) in damages in addition to the deaths, on engineering officers and their superiors.

In early 1985, &quot;Ranger&quot; was used to film some interior scenes for the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. In 1986, the ship stood in for for scenes filmed for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.

On 14 July 1987, &quot;Ranger&quot; started her &quot;Pearl&quot; Anniversary Cruise. During this cruise, &quot;Ranger&quot; relieved &quot;Midway&quot; and her carrier group in the Indian Ocean. During this period, &quot;Ranger&quot; took part in Operation Earnest Will under which the Kuwait tankers were reflagged under US colors.

On 24 July 1987, Tactical Electronics Warfare Squadron 131 (VAQ-131) began the first Pacific Fleet deployment of the EA-6B Prowler equipped with AGM-88 HARM missiles, deployed in &quot;Ranger&quot;.

On 19 October 1987, &quot;Ranger&quot; took part in Operation Nimble Archer, an attack on two Iranian oil platforms in the Persian Gulf by US Navy forces. The attack was a response to Iran&#x27;s missile attack three days earlier on MV &quot;Sea Isle City&quot;, a reflagged Kuwaiti oil tanker at anchor off Kuwait. The action occurred during Operation Earnest Will, the effort to protect Kuwaiti shipping amid the Iran-Iraq War. Air cover was provided by , two F-14 Tomcat fighters, and an E-2 Hawkeye from &quot;Ranger&quot;.

On 3 August 1989, &quot;Ranger&quot; rescued 39 Vietnamese refugees, adrift for 10 days on a barge in heavy seas and monsoon rains in the South China Sea, about from NAS Cubi Point. SH-3s Sea Kings from HS-14 along with two Sea Knights assisted. An A-6 Intruder from VA-145 spotted the barge, which had apparently broken loose from its mooring near a small island off the coast of Vietnam with 10 men on board. Twenty-nine other refugees from a sinking refugee boat climbed aboard the barge when it drifted out to sea. After examination by medical personnel, all were flown to NAS Cubi Point for further processing.

=== 1990s ===

President George H. W. Bush addressed the nation on 16 January 1991 at 9 pm EST and announced that Operation Desert Storm had begun. The Navy launched 228 sorties from &quot;Ranger&quot; and in the Persian Gulf, from en route to the Persian Gulf, and from , &quot;Saratoga&quot;, and &quot;America&quot; in the Red Sea. In addition, the Navy launched more than 100 Tomahawk missiles from nine ships in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf.

An A-6E Intruder from &quot;Ranger&quot; was shot down two miles off the Iraqi coast by antiaircraft artillery on 18 January 1991, after laying MK36 naval mines on a waterway linking the Iraqi naval base of Umm Qasr with the Persian Gulf. The pilot and the navigator/bombardier were killed.

On 26 January, an EA-6B Prowler from &quot;Ranger&quot; spotted two large tankers in a waterway northeast of Bubiyan Island. Two of &quot;Ranger&quot;″s A-6Es hit one of them with an AGM-123 Skipper missile on the starboard side.

On 6 February, an F-14A Tomcat of Fighter Squadron 1 (VF-1) &quot;Wolfpack&quot; launched from the &quot;Ranger&quot; downed an Iraqi Mi-8 Hip helicopter with an AIM-9M Sidewinder missile. At 9 pm EST on 27 February, President Bush declared Kuwait had been liberated and Operation Desert Storm would end at midnight.
On 21 April 1992, in harmony with other World War II 50th-anniversary festivities, &quot;Ranger&quot; participated in the commemorative re-enactment of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, Japan. Two World War II-era B-25 bombers were craned on board, and over 1,500 guests (including national, local and military media) were embarked to witness the two vintage aircraft travel down &quot;Ranger&quot;″ flight deck and take off. In June, &quot;Ranger&quot; made an historic port visit to Vancouver, British Columbia, in conjunction with her final phase of pre-deployment workups.

Fully combat ready, &quot;Ranger&quot; began her 21st and final western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment on 1 August 1992. On 18 August, she entered Yokosuka, for a six-day port visit and upkeep. &quot;Ranger&quot; entered the Persian Gulf on 14 September by transiting the Straits of Hormuz. The next day, &quot;Ranger&quot; relieved in an unusual close-aboard ceremony and along with her embarked air wing, Carrier Air Wing 2, immediately began flying patrol missions in support of the United Kingdom and United States-declared &quot;No Fly&quot; zone in southern Iraq: Operation Southern Watch.

While in the Persian Gulf, former Cold War adversaries became at-sea partners as &quot;Ranger&quot;, British, and French naval forces joined with the Russian guided missile destroyer for an exercise involving communication, maneuvering, and signaling drills. During joint operations, a Russian Kamov Ka-27 &quot;Helix&quot; helicopter landed aboard &quot;Ranger&quot;. It was the first such landing on a US Navy aircraft carrier.
&quot;Ranger&quot; left the Persian Gulf on 4 December 1992 and steamed at high speed to the coast of Somalia. &quot;Ranger&quot; played a significant role in the massive relief effort for starving Somalis in Operation Restore Hope. The &quot;Ranger&quot;/CVW-2 team provided photo and visual reconnaissance, airborne air traffic control, logistics support, and on-call close air support for Navy and Marine amphibious forces. Throughout Operations Southern Watch and Restore Hope, &quot;Ranger&quot; took 63 digital photographs which were sent by International Marine Satellite to the Navy Office of Information within hours of being taken. This was the first time digital pictures were successfully transmitted from a US Navy ship at sea.

On 19 December 1992, &quot;Ranger&quot; was relieved on station by &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and began her last journey homeward to San Diego.

== Decommissioning and fate ==
After the late 1980s defense cuts, &quot;Ranger&quot; did not undergo the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) modernization process as did her three sisters and the later &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class ships, and by the early 1990s, her material condition was declining. Both the outgoing Bush and incoming Clinton administrations recommended cuts to the defense budget, so the retirement of &quot;Ranger&quot;, along with her sisters &quot;Forrestal&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;, was put forth. &quot;Ranger&quot; was decommissioned on 10 July 1993 after 36 years of service, and was at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Bremerton, Washington. This decommissioning came instead of a refit scheduled for the same year. Such an extension would have extended &quot;Ranger&quot;″s life into 2002, requiring a reauthorization in 1994. In September 2010, the not-for-profit USS &quot;Ranger&quot; Foundation submitted an application to Naval Sea Systems Command proposing the donation of &quot;Ranger&quot; for use as a museum ship and multipurpose facility, to be located on the Columbia River at Chinook Landing Marine Park in Fairview, Oregon. However, in September 2012, NAVSEA rejected the foundation&#x27;s proposal, and redesignated the ship for scrapping. Preparations for disposal &quot;Ranger&quot; were completed 29 May 2014.

In August 2014, a new attempt began to convince the Navy not to scrap the ship. A petition on Change.org attracted over 2500 signatures. The hope was that &quot;Ranger&quot; could be located in Long Beach harbor as a museum. However, when asked by the &quot;Long Beach Press-Telegram&quot;, NAVSEA stated that &quot;Ranger&quot; was no longer available for donation and was slated to be scrapped in 2015.

On 22 December 2014, the U.S. Navy paid one cent to International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, to tow and scrap &quot;Ranger&quot;. International Shipbreaking paid to tow her around South America, through the Straits of Magellan, as &quot;Ranger&quot; was too big to fit through the Panama Canal. The tow began on 5 March 2015 from the inactive ships maintenance facility, Bremerton, Washington, to Brownsville. International Shipbreaking expected to make a profit from &quot;Ranger&quot; after the costs of the tow and the actual dismantling of the ship.

On 7 April 2015, ex-&quot;Ranger&quot; was seen anchored about three miles offshore at Panama City, Panama, attracting a lot of wild speculation as President Obama was scheduled to arrive two days later, for the 7th Summit of the Americas. Newspapers went so far as to repeat the local speculation that the ship was there to provide security for President Obama. On 12 July 2015, &quot;Ranger&quot; arrived at Brownsville for scrapping. The scrapping process was completed on 1 November 2017, though more than five tons of historic items from the ship were preserved for display at the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; Museum.

Both of &quot;Ranger&quot;&#x27;s anchors were reused on the 2003 commissioned, USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;.

==Awards and decorations==
&quot;Ranger&quot; earned 13 battle stars for service during the Vietnam War.

<text>XENPAK is a multisource agreement (MSA), instigated by Agilent Technologies and Agere Systems, that defines a fiber-optic or wired transceiver module which conforms to the 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) standard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 working group. The MSA group received input from both transceiver and equipment manufacturers during the definition process. XENPAK has been replaced by more compact devices providing the same functionality.

==History==
The XENPAK MSA was publicly announced on March 12, 2001 and the first revision of the document was publicly released on May 7, 2001. The most recent revision of the MSA, Issue 3.0, was published on September 18, 2002. The result covered all physical medium dependent (PMD) types defined by the IEEE at that time for 802.3ae 10GbE.

Although the XENPAK agreement received early support, its modules were thought to be overly large for high-density applications. , vendors generally changed to use XFP modules for longer distances, and Enhanced small form-factor pluggable transceivers, known as SFP+ modules, for higher densities.
The newer modules have a purely serial interface, compared to the four &quot;lane&quot; XAUI interface used in XENPAK.

==Description==
XENPAK modules were supplied for physical layer interfaces supporting multi-mode and single mode fiber optic cables and InfiniBand copper cables with connectors known as CX4. Transmission distances vary from to for fiber and up to on CX4 cable. Newer XENPAKs using the 10GBase-LX4 standard operated using multiple wavelengths on legacy multi-mode fibers at distances of up to , eliminating the need to reinstall cable in a building when upgrading certain 1 Gbit/s circuits to 10 Gbit/s.

==Replacement form factors==
The XENPAK form factor was initially supported by numerous network equipment manufacturers and module makers. However, advances in technology led to more compact form factors for 10 Gigabit Ethernet applications. Soon after the standard was introduced in 2001, two related standards emerged: XPAK and X2. These two standards have the same electrical interface as XENPAK (known as XAUI) but different mechanical properties.

The XPAK group was announced on March 19, 2002, first published their specification on May 24, 2002, and version 2.3 on August 1, 2003.

The X2 group was announced on July 22, 2002, and published their specification on February 13, 2003.
Issue 3.0 of the XENPAK MSA was transferred to the Small Form Factor committee as document INF-8474 on September 18, 2002.

The XENPAK MSA website existed through the end of 2008.

== Use with modern optics ==
As of 2014, adapters are available that permit use of any modern SFP+ 10 Gbit/s optic in a XENPAK interface.
