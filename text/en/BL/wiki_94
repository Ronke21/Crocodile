<text>Susan Carol Davis (née Alpert; born April 13, 1944) is a former American politician who served as the U.S. representative for for one term and for nine terms from 2001 to 2021. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Her district included central and eastern portions of the city of San Diego, as well as eastern suburbs such as El Cajon, La Mesa, Spring Valley, and Lemon Grove.

==Early life, education and career==

Davis was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She has spent most of her life in California. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley where she was a member of Delta Phi Epsilon sorority. She earned a master&#x27;s degree in social work from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her husband Steve Davis was a doctor in the Air Force during the Vietnam War. After returning to California, she became a social worker in San Diego.

==Early political career==

Davis became active in politics through her membership in the local branch of the League of Women Voters, of which she became president in 1977. She was elected to the board of San Diego Unified School District in 1983. She served there until 1992, including two years as president of the body.

In 1994, she was elected to the California State Assembly, and was reelected in 1996 and 1998. In the Assembly, Davis chaired the Committee on Consumer Protection, Government Efficiency and Economic Development. She authored a state law giving women direct access to their OB/Gyn doctors without requiring a referral from their primary care physicians. Other legislation she authored established the right of a patient to obtain a second medical opinion and allowed frail senior citizens to remain in their homes while receiving state-funded nursing care. She introduced laws to reward high-achieving teachers and to establish after-school programs at public schools.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 2000, Davis challenged three-term Republican incumbent Brian Bilbray in what was then the 49th district, winning with 50 percent of the vote. Her district was renumbered the 53rd district after the 2000 census redistricting and made somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor. Following the redistricting, she was reelected eight times without much difficulty. She is the first Democrat to represent what is now the 53rd district for more than one term in over half a century. The only other Democrat to represent this district since the Harry Truman administration, Lynn Schenk, was toppled by Bilbray in the 1994 Republican wave.

Davis introduced a federal version of the California OB/Gyn law she authored at the start of every Congress from 2001 to 2009. Provisions of her OB/Gyn bill were included in the health care reform bill enacted into law.

In 2011, Davis voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

Davis was a member of the New Democrat Coalition and she portrayed herself as someone who was willing to work across party lines. She served on the House Armed Services Committee. She also served on the Education and Workforce Committee, where she was the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development.

In 2012, Davis filed a lawsuit to recover over $150,000 in campaign funds from her former campaign treasurer, Kinde Durkee. Durkee was later sentenced to eight years in prison for fraud after pleading guilty to stealing seven million dollars from more than fifty people.

On September 4, 2019, Davis announced that she would not seek re-election in 2020.

<doc id="409736" wikidata="Q160107" url="?curid=409736" title="Delphinium">
<text>Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.

All members of the genus &quot;Delphinium&quot; are toxic to humans and livestock. The common name larkspur is shared between perennial &quot;Delphinium&quot; species and annual species of the genus &quot;Consolida&quot;. Molecular data show that &quot;Consolida&quot;, as well as another segregate genus, &quot;Aconitella&quot;, are both embedded in &quot;Delphinium&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Delphinium&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek word () which means &quot;dolphin&quot;, a name used in &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; for some kind of larkspur. Pedanius Dioscorides said the plant got its name because of its dolphin-shaped flowers.

==Habitat==
Species with short stems and few flowers such as &quot;Delphinium nuttallianum&quot; and &quot;Delphinium bicolor&quot; appear in habitats like prairies and the sagebrush steppe. Tall and robust species with many flowers, such as &quot;Delphinium occidentale&quot;, appear more often in forests.

==Description==

The leaves are deeply lobed with three to seven toothed, pointed lobes in a palmate shape. The main flowering stem is erect, and varies greatly in size between the species, from 10 centimetres in some alpine species, up to 2 m tall in the larger meadowland species.

In June and July (Northern Hemisphere), the plant is topped with a raceme of many flowers, varying in colour from purple and blue, to red, yellow, or white. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and have many stamens. In most species, each flower consists of five petal-like sepals which grow together to form a hollow pocket with a spur at the end, which gives the plant its name, usually more or less dark blue. Within the sepals are four true petals, small, inconspicuous, and commonly coloured similarly to the sepals. The uppermost sepal is spurred, and encloses the nectar-secreting spurs of the two upper petals.

The seeds are small and often shiny black. The plants flower from late spring to late summer, and are pollinated by butterflies and bumble bees. Despite the toxicity, &quot;Delphinium&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the dot moth and small angle shades.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Delineation of &quot;Delphinium&quot; ===

Genetic analysis suggests that &quot;Delphinium&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;, as it was delineated before the 21st century, is polyphyletic. Nested within &quot;Delphinium&quot; &quot;s.l.&quot; are &quot;Aconitella&quot;, &quot;Consolida&quot;, and &quot;Aconitum&quot;. To make &quot;Delphinium&quot; monophyletic, several interventions were made. The new genus &quot;Staphisagria&quot; was erected containing &quot;Staphisagria macrosperma&quot; (&quot;D. staphisagria&quot;), &quot;S. requienii&quot; (&quot;D. requini&quot;) and &quot;S. picta&quot; (&quot;D. pictum&quot;), representing the sister group to all other Delphinieae. Further genetic analysis has shown that the two large subgenera &quot;Aconitum (Aconitum)&quot; and &quot;Aconitum (Lycoctonum)&quot; are the sister group to &quot;Aconitum gymnandrum&quot;, &quot;Delphinium (Delphinium)&quot;, &quot;Delphinium (Delphinastrum)&quot;, &quot;Consolida&quot; and &quot;Aconitella&quot;. To make &quot;Aconitum&quot; monophyletic, &quot;A. gymnandrum&quot; has now been reassigned to a new monotypic genus, &quot;Gymnaconitum&quot;. Finally, &quot;Consolida&quot; and &quot;Aconitella&quot; are synonymized with &quot;Delphinium&quot;.

=== Subgenera ===
&quot;D. arthriscifolium&quot; is sister to all other species of &quot;Delphinium&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (so excluding &quot;Staphisagria&quot;). It should be placed in its own subgenus, but no proposal naming this subgenus has been made yet. The subgenera &quot;Delphinium (Delphinium)&quot; and &quot;Delphinium (Delphinastrum)&quot; are sister to the group consisting of the species of &quot;Consolida&quot; and &quot;Aconitella&quot;, which together make up the subgenus &quot;Delphinium (Consolida)&quot;. &quot;Aconitella&quot; cannot be retained as a subgenus because &quot;A. barbata&quot; does not cluster with the remaining species previously assigned to that genus, without creating five further subgenera.

* &quot;D. staphisagria&quot; = &quot;Staphisagria macrosperma&quot;

==Ecology==
Delphiniums can attract butterflies and other pollinators.

==Cultivation==

Various delphiniums are cultivated as ornamental plants, for traditional and native plant gardens. The numerous hybrids and cultivars are primarily used as garden plants, providing height at the back of the summer border, in association with roses, lilies, and geraniums.

Most delphinium hybrids and cultivars are derived from &quot;D. elatum&quot;. Hybridisation was developed in the 19th century, led by Victor Lemoine in France. Other hybrid crosses have included &quot;D. bruninianum&quot;, &quot;D. cardinale&quot;, &quot;D. cheilanthum&quot;, and &quot;D. formosum&quot;.

Numerous cultivars have been selected as garden plants, and for cut flowers and floristry. They are available in shades of white, pink, purple, and blue. The blooming plant is also used in displays and specialist competitions at flower and garden shows, such as the Chelsea Flower Show.

The &#x27;Pacific Giant&#x27; hybrids are a group with individual single-colour cultivar names, developed by Reinelt in the United States. They typically grow to tall on long stems, by wide. They reportedly can tolerate deer. Millennium delphinium hybrids, bred by Dowdeswell&#x27;s in New Zealand, are reportedly better in warmer climates than the Pacific hybrids. Flower colours in shades of red, orange, and pink have been hybridized from &quot;D. cardinale&quot; by Americans Reinelt and Samuelson.

===Award of garden merit===
The following delphinium cultivars have received the Award of Garden Merit from the British Royal Horticultural Society:
==Toxicity==
All parts of these plants are considered toxic to humans, especially the younger parts, causing severe digestive discomfort if ingested, and skin irritation. Larkspur, especially tall larkspur, is a significant cause of cattle poisoning on rangelands in the western United States. Larkspur is more common in high-elevation areas, and many ranchers delay moving cattle onto such ranges until late summer when the toxicity of the plants is reduced.
Death is through cardiotoxic and neuromuscular blocking effects, and can occur within a few hours of ingestion. All parts of the plant contain various diterpenoid alkaloids, typified by methyllycaconitine, and are very poisonous.

==Uses==
The juice of the flowers, particularly &quot;D. consolida&quot;, mixed with alum, gives a blue ink.

All plant parts are poisonous in large doses, especially the seeds, that contain up to 1.4% of alkaloids.

<doc id="409741" wikidata="Q17143510" url="?curid=409741" title="I Am – Somebody">
<text>&quot;I Am – Somebody&quot; is a poem often recited by Reverend Jesse Jackson, and was used as part of PUSH-Excel, a program designed to motivate black students.

A similar poem was written in the early 1940s by Reverend William Holmes Borders, Sr., senior pastor at the Greater Wheat Street Baptist Church and civil rights activist in Atlanta, Georgia.

== History ==
A recording of Jackson delivering the poem appears on the album &quot;I Am Somebody&quot; published on Respect Records TAS-2601 in 1971.

Jackson recited the free verse poem on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1972 (taped in February, aired in May). It was geared to fulfilling &quot;Sesame Street&quot;’s initial curriculum for serving under-privileged city children, as well as promoting cultural understanding. On Sesame Street, lines of &quot;I am/Somebody&quot; or &quot;But I am/Somebody&quot; were recited in a call and response fashion by Jackson and the children. During the segment, children of multiple races were gathered on the Sesame Street set and led by Jackson in the poem. This performance is included on the 2006 DVD release &quot;Sesame Street: Old School&quot;.

&quot;I Am – Somebody&quot; was also recited by Jackson, with the assembled crowd at Los Angeles Coliseum for the famous Wattstax Music Festival on August 20, 1972.

It also appears in &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, a 1996 documentary examining the historic 1974 Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (which was still known as Zaire at that time). It was performed with band as part of a concert preceding the bout that was said to be the finest collection of African American entertainers ever assembled at that time.

The poem inspired the title of a 1998 book called &quot;I Am Somebody!&quot; () by Charnan Simon, but did not print the poem itself.

==Legacy==
About a month after Dr. Seuss died in 1991, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; paid tribute to the book &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;, by having Jackson appear on the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment and recite it in the same oratative fashion he performs the poem.

The poem was recited in a somewhat different form in what sounds like a speech by Jackson sampled on the 1973 funk single &quot;Same Beat&quot; by The J.B.&#x27;s. The J.B.&#x27;s titled an album and track &quot;Damn Right I Am Somebody&quot; the following year.

The phrase has become so much of a calling card for Jackson that he yells it in a cameo in the movie &quot;Undercover Brother&quot;.

&quot;I Am – Somebody&quot; also inspired a similarly titled song on Carlos Santana&#x27;s 2005 album, &quot;All That I Am&quot;, which featured the American rapper will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas.

&quot;I Am Somebody&quot; is a song by the hip-hop group Jurassic 5 on the album &quot;Power In Numbers&quot;, which samples the poem numerous times.

A recording of &quot;I Am – Somebody&quot; is on the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Back&quot; on &quot;Paris Presents: Hard Truth Soldiers&quot; by Dead Prez, Kam, Paris and Public Enemy.

Primal Scream sampled the Wattstax concert speech heavily for the track &quot;Come Together&quot; on their 1991 album &quot;Screamadelica&quot;.

<doc id="409746" wikidata="Q986387" url="?curid=409746" title="Cárdenas, Cuba">
<text>San Juan de Dios de Cárdenas, or simply Cárdenas (), is a municipality and city in the Matanzas Province of Cuba, about by air [ by road] east of Havana. Cárdenas is the 15th most-populated Cuban city and the second most populated one not being a provincial seat, after Manzanillo.

The Cuban Flag was first raised over Cuba in this historic city of straight and narrow streets (the &quot;Charleston of the Caribbean&quot;), horse-drawn carriages, industry and &quot;cangrejos&quot; (blue crabs). It was in Cárdenas where José Arechabala S.A. launched and started production of Havana Club in 1934.

Cárdenas is the northernmost municipality in Cuba.

==Geography==
===Overview===
Cárdenas is a maritime port town on the level and somewhat marshy shore of a spacious bay of the northern coast of the island (Bay of Cárdenas), sheltered by a long promontory (Hicacos peninsula, including the Varadero beach resort). The city lies between the sea and hills.

A large quantity of asphalt has been taken from the bed of the harbour. A flow of fresh water from the bed of the harbour is another peculiar feature; it presumably comes from the outlets of subterranean rivers.

There are mostly narrow streets, various squares (including the Plaza de Colón, with a bronze statue of Columbus given to the city by Queen Isabella II. and erected in 1862) and substantial and elegant business and public buildings, including the ornate parish church designed by Architect Rafael Carrerá, who also built the famous Palacio Aldama in Central Havana.

===Subdivision===
Before the 1976 reform, Cárdenas was divided into the barrios of Cantel, Fundición, Guásimas, Marina, Méndez Capote, Pueblo Nuevo and Versalles.

The world-famous beach and resort town of Varadero is part of the municipality.

Cárdenas was founded on 8 March 1828, with the help of several old aristocratic Spanish-Cuban families from the nearby provincial capital of Matanzas and in 1861 already had 12,910 inhabitants. The completion of the railroad in 1841 led to further development. Cárdenas was one of the first cities in Cuba to have electric service, public transportation (trams), telegraph and telephone.

The city was not laid out in the traditional central-plaza Spanish custom, but rather, inspired on a North American perpendicular grid pattern, modeled on the city of Charleston, South Carolina, with the help of American (Confederate) landscape engineers. Another notable link between the city and South Carolina was Cárdenas native, Ambrosio José Gonzales, who would spend several years residing there and married Harriet Elliot, daughter of prominent South Carolina planter and state Sen. William Elliot, in 1856, living 24 miles from Charleston. According to historian Antonio Rafael de la Cova, Gonzales would join the Confederate forces and was nominated for the rank of general six times but was unsuccessful due to a personal feud with Jefferson Davis.

In 1850, the Venezuelan General Narciso López, along with some Americans and Cuban exiles (including Gonzales), landed here on a filibustering expedition, and held the town for a few hours, abandoning it when he saw that the people would not rise to support him in his efforts to secure Cuban independence. López did, however, raise for first time the modern Flag of Cuba, designed by him along with a local Cuban Miguel Teurbe Tolon.

In May 1898, during the Spanish–American War, three notable battles were fought at Cardenas. However, credit for the Spanish victories goes mainly to the local Cuban forces, led, among others, by General Carlos M. de Rojas.

In the late 19th century and early 20th Century, Cárdenas was one of the main sugar-exporting towns of Cuba, and had received a great influx of European immigrants, including from Ireland, France, Italy and Corsica - many Cárdenas families were known for having foreign-sounding surnames, such as Jones, Larrieu, Smith, Villa-Giorgi and Sterling, among others.

By 1907 the population was 24,280. The shallowness of the harbour required loads to be lightened and repeated loading of cargoes. After the 1933 Cuba–Brownsville hurricane hit the city badly, José Arechabala S.A. financed the dredging of the harbour and the reform of the whole coastline, including the construction of the &quot;Monumento a la Bandera&quot; (monument to the national Cuban flag). This justified the Arechabala appointment as &quot;Benefactora eminente&quot; of Cárdenas. The surrounding region is farmed for its fertility.

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Cárdenas had a population of 158,322. With a total area of , it has a population density of . Cardenas experiences a population growth of 0.95% a year.

<doc id="409747" wikidata="Q316964" url="?curid=409747" title="Jeremy Sumpter">
<text>Jeremy Robert Myron Sumpter (born February 5, 1989) is an American actor. His prominent roles include the title role in the 2003 fantasy adventure film &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, Jacob in the 2014 disaster film &quot;Into the Storm&quot;, and the recurring role of J. D. McCoy in the NBC television series &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2008–2010).

==Early life==
Sumpter was born in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to parents Sandy (née Johnson) and Gary Sumpter. He has a twin sister, Jessica, and two other siblings, Travis and Jennifer. His family moved to his mother&#x27;s hometown, Mount Sterling, Kentucky, when he was ten months old.

==Career==
When Sumpter was 11, he entered International Modeling and Talent Association and started his modeling in Kentucky. He also won Pre-Teen Male Model of the Year, where he signed with Mark Robert as his personal manager. Sumpter then decided to move to Los Angeles, California with his family and start acting afterwards.

Sumpter&#x27;s first movie role was in the 2001 film &quot;Frailty&quot; as the young Adam Mieks seen in flashbacks. Sumpter received a Saturn Award nomination for &quot;Best Performance by a Younger Actor&quot; for his performance. Following that, he appeared with Danny Glover in the Showtime film &quot;Just a Dream&quot;, for which he received a Young Artist Award for &quot;Best Performance in a TV Movie, Mini-Series or Special - Leading Young Actor&quot;. His next film was &quot;Local Boys&quot;, a family surfing drama, with Mark Harmon and Eric Christian Olsen.

In July 2002, at age 13, Sumpter was selected for the role of Peter Pan in the then-upcoming film adaptation. Sumpter did nearly all of his stunts for the film himself. To prepare, he says he practiced sword fighting as much as five hours a day, as well as training in gymnastics and lifting weights. While filming in Australia, he supplemented his training with cricket and surfing. Sumpter grew several inches during the film&#x27;s production, requiring staging tricks to retain Captain Hook&#x27;s height advantage over Peter in face-to-face scenes late in the process. Producer Lucy Fisher also said that, &quot;The window he flies out of had to be enlarged twice.&quot; Despite the film&#x27;s box office failure, Sumpter has won both a Saturn and Young Artist Award for the film.

In the fall of 2004, Sumpter starred in the TV series &quot;Clubhouse&quot; as a boy who gets his dream job of working as a batboy for a New York City major league baseball team. The series was canceled by CBS after five episodes; all 11 episodes made have since been broadcast on cable/satellite channels. He then starred in &quot;Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life&quot;, a Lifetime Channel movie about a popular teenager whose life is ruined by an addiction to internet pornography.

Sumpter spent the summer of 2005 in Oregon filming the teen comedy &quot;The Sasquatch Gang&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Sasquatch Dumpling Gang&quot;), released in November 2006. He had a small role in the film &quot;An American Crime&quot;, which played on Showtime in 2008 before going to DVD. He appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot; as the boyfriend of a girl whose parents are murdered.
Sumpter completed filming roles in the coming-of-age comedy &quot;Calvin Marshall&quot;, &quot;Soul Surfer&quot; and &quot;Death and Cremation&quot;. He appeared in the meteorological disaster film &quot;Into the Storm&quot; as Jacob Hodges, a young cameraman for the stormchasers.

==Personal life==
During filming for &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, Sumpter briefly shared a childhood crush with co-star Rachel Hurd-Wood. In December 2015, Sumpter announced that he and Lauren Pacheco were engaged to be married, but in October 2016 stated that they were no longer engaged. On October 1, 2022, Sumpter married Elizabeth Treadway in a ceremony in Columbia, Tennessee. Sumpter announced on December 25, 2022, via Instagram that he and Treadway are expecting a baby girl. On April 17, 2023, Sumpter announced that Treadway had given birth to their daughter.

<doc id="409750" wikidata="Q6132807" url="?curid=409750" title="James Downey (Internet performance artist)">
<text>James Downey (born July 4, 1958) is an American author and rare book and document conservator. He is also known as an internet performance artist, who has organized two relatively high-profile stunts, &quot;Paint the Moon&quot; and &quot;Nobel Prize for Jo&quot;. In addition, he is one of the principals behind the ballistics research project &quot;Ballistics by the Inch&quot; and was a writer for Guns.com. His &quot;This I Believe&quot; essay was one of the most widely read prior to its broadcast on March 23, 2015.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Downey graduated from Grinnell College in Iowa, and did graduate work in English Literature at the University of Iowa. While there he discovered the Iowa Center for the Book, where he learned bookbinding, papermaking and book conservation, launching his career as a book and paper conservator. While at Iowa he also took classes with the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, which furthered his desire to write.

==Books==

===&quot;Communion of Dreams&quot;===
Downey&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Communion of Dreams&quot; was published in January 2012. Set in 2052, when the human race is still struggling to recover from a massive pandemic flu some 40 years earlier. When an independent prospector on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan discovers an alien artifact, assumptions that we are alone in the universe are called into question. Knowing that news of such a discovery could prompt chaos on Earth, a small team is sent to investigate and hopefully manage the situation. What they find is that there&#x27;s more to human history, and human abilities, than any of them ever imagined. And that they will need all those insights, and all those abilities, to face the greatest threat yet to human survival.

===&quot;Her Final Year&quot;===
Downey has also written, with co-author John Bourke, a memoir of care giving for their respective mothers-in-law. That memoir, &quot;Her Final Year&quot;, was published in July 2011. The book offers some perspective on the experience of caregiving for a victim of dementia from the point of view of people living it. It is part memoir, part journal, and all based on blog posts, e-mails, and journal entries they and their wives wrote at the time. The authors were both full-time in-home care givers and felt that reading about their experiences, their difficulties and decisions, and their recoveries, would be helpful to others currently in a care giving role.

===&quot;St Cybi&#x27;s Well&quot;===
Downey&#x27;s second novel, &quot;St Cybi&#x27;s Well&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Communion of Dreams&quot;, was published on May 1, 2020. The year is 2012, and the theocratic American &quot;Government of National Unity&quot; has increasing problems both at home and abroad due to its openly racist and hostile policies. Darnell Sidwell, USAF, but on extended detachment to the Israeli moon shuttle program as a pilot, has gone to Wales to visit his sister . . . and to potentially find a miracle cure for the eye disease that threatens to end his career. There, between the American Security Ministry agents following him and an old man who seems to have walked out of myth wanting to recruit him for . . . something . . . Darnell discovers that the world is not nearly as logical or sensible as he always believed.

And then the world-encompassing pandemic flu begins.

==Internet projects==
Downey organized two relatively high-profile internet projects which gained some notoriety at the time.

===Lasers at the moon (&quot;Paint the Moon&quot;)===
In 2001, working off an idea in a novel he was writing (&quot;Communion of Dreams&quot;), Downey theorised that there may be enough laser powered pens to show a red spot on the Moon. He created a simple website and dubbed the project &quot;Paint the Moon&quot;. As a &#x27;collective lyric fantasy&#x27;, he encouraged anyone in possession of a laser pen to point it at the Moon at a specified time on a certain date, theoretically to create a dot on the Moon&#x27;s surface. &quot;Uniting millions of people around the globe to attempt this ostensibly impossible task is a new kind of performance art,&quot; Downey wrote on his site. The idea was picked up on the web and in the media, and generated a lot of worldwide attention, including interviews with Howard Stern and on Weekend Edition Saturday. Though many responded back with e-mails notifying Downey of their participation, the project was a failure in its ostensible goal. Eric Van Stryland, director of Center for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers at the University of Central Florida noted to USA Today that although it&#x27;s &quot;still a fun idea&quot;, such a project would need &quot;at least a few million billion red laser pointers to see a big red spot on the moon.&quot;

===Harry Potter Nobel Prize letter writing campaign===
In 2003, Downey attempted to win Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling a 2004 Nobel Prize for Literature, by organising a letter writing campaign via e-mail. Attempting to get author Rowling considered for the prestigious award, he created a website launched in July 2003 called the &quot;Nobel Prize For Jo&quot;, urging the global community to participate. On his web page, he was quoted as saying that &quot;I bet if we sent them a few hundred thousand letters, they&#x27;d pay attention.&quot; Hailed by the BBC as an &quot;Internet crusade&quot;, it failed to get any letters sent in, and Downey happily concedes that it is probably his greatest failure to date. &quot;Even the Harry Potter fans hated the idea,&quot; said Downey. Only one hundred people are reported to have e-mailed to the address provided.

Only literary professors, members of literature academies, and past winners of the prize may submit suggestions for Nobel recipients. A fan-based campaign alone would not have caused Rowling to win the prize.

<text>: Lan Yu &quot;is also the Chinese name for Orchid Island.&quot;

Lan Yu () is a 2001 gay-themed Hong Kong-Mainland Chinese film set in Beijing by Hong Kong director Stanley Kwan.

==Background==
The movie is based on a novel published anonymously on the Internet in 1998. The filming itself took place in Beijing, without government permission. The movie, which was directed by Stanley Kwan, tells a romantic and tragic love story of two men. It is based on the Chinese novel 北京故事 (&quot;Běijīng gùshì&quot;, &quot;[A] Beijing Story&quot;) by an author identified only as a 北京同志 (&quot;Běijīng tóngzhì&quot;, [A] Beijing Comrade). &quot;Tongzhi&quot; is a term now often used to refer to gay and lesbian identities in China. Since this work contained positive depictions of gay men, explicit (by Chinese standards) gay sex scenes, and resurrected the ghost of Tiananmen Square, at the time, no mainland Chinese publisher would have published it, nor would the author be safe from government reprisals. Hence, its anonymous publication on the Internet. The story is set in Beijing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and makes vivid reference to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The film can be counted as a mainland-made movie as most of the crew are from mainland China. &quot;Lan Yu&quot; received a brief mainland Chinese run during the Film Association of Beijing University-sponsored &quot;China&#x27;s First Gay Film Festival&quot; at Peking University in December 2001. Although publicity for this film festival was mainly limited to the university&#x27;s website, all scheduled screenings of this film quickly sold all out.

== Plot ==

In late 1980s, Lan Yu (Liu Ye), a poor architecture student from northeast China, desperately needs money. He meets an acquaintance, Li Zheng (Li Huatong), who persuades Lan engage in prostitution. Naively, Lan agreed. He is introduced by Li to a successful businessman, Chen Handong (Hu Jun). (Li is also Chen Handong&#x27;s lieutenant and one of the few people knowing of his sexual inclination.) Lan Yu is evidently smitten for he left with the older man rather than the man he was to meet. The night they spent together was not only a sexual, but also an emotional awakening, for the boy. While Lan Yu immediately fell in love with Chen Handong, the older man, who was very closeted, wanted no emotional relationship, only sex. He tried his best to avoid any attachment whatsoever with the youth, instead he showered Lan Yu with money and expensive gifts. His efforts to turn Lan Yu&#x27;s love for him into a dependent, loveless relationship failed until Lan Yu discovered Chen in the middle of the seduction of a young college athlete. Crushed, Lan Yu left Chen&#x27;s apartment. They would not meet again until 4 June 1989, when Chen went looking for Lan Yu, fearing for the youth&#x27;s safety amid the army&#x27;s Tiananmen Square crackdown. Finding Lan Yu dishevelled and distraught, the incident reunited the two and opened a new chapter in their relationship.

Although Chen Handong still could not commit totally to Lan Yu, he now gave the youth time and attention as well as money, a car, and an expensive villa in the Beijing suburbs. None of the material things were what Lan Yu really wanted although he now accepted them. Chen now lived, somewhat surreptitiously, with Lan Yu and that was all that mattered to the latter. Unfortunately, Chen Handong, being the only son of a top government bureaucrat, was under increasing pressure to marry. After a whirlwind courtship, Chen Handong married Jingping (Su Jin), a translator who helped him negotiate a successful business deal with the Russians. Upon this marriage, Lan Yu moved out of the villa (although it was in his name and legally his) and Chen Handong and he lost all contact. Shortly thereafter, Chen Handong and Jingping divorced.

A chance meeting at the airport and Lan Yu&#x27;s invitation to a home-cooked meal reunited the pair. Finally, Chen Handong reciprocated the love and commitment Lan Yu had so freely given and the two were truly a couple. But, Chen Handong&#x27;s company, perhaps because of the Russian deal, had aroused government suspicion. An investigation of charges of smuggling and money-laundering started. With his father dead and no longer able to protect him, Chen Handong faced a long prison term, if not execution. Lan Yu took his savings and the proceeds of the sale of his villa and all of Chen&#x27;s other gifts and raised enough funds to get Chen Handong out of legal and financial trouble. Unfortunately, just as he realised that the younger man was truly his beloved and his destiny, Lan Yu is killed in a construction accident. Three years later, Chen Handong is still grief-stricken and that is how the film begins with his thinking back on the past and what might have been.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Lan Yu&quot; received positive reviews from critics, and won numerous awards in various movie festivals throughout Hong Kong and Taiwan, including Liu Ye&#x27;s win for Best Actor at Taiwan&#x27;s 38th Golden Horse Awards. It was also an official selection at many major film festivals, including the Sundance and the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. However, there has been some negative criticism. Writing in &quot;The Film Journal&quot;, editor Rick A. Curnutte Jr. admired the performances of Hu and Liu noting that they &quot;are dynamic performers, capturing the evocative nature of the relationship beautifully, and they play-off of each other richly, allowing shared ownership of this mature, fragile love affair.&quot; However, he faulted Kwan for not exploring the end of Chen&#x27;s marriage &quot;which thematically works but doesn&#x27;t give us any inclinating as to why the marriage ends, something that might have lent more poignancy to the resulting return&quot;. Finally and &quot;most disastrous[ly], the film ends with an abrupt, overly tragic ending, seemingly punishing the two principals for their indiscretions, when the entire film coming before suggests that they have earned their love by lamenting their mistakes.&quot; Despite these flaws, Curnutte felt the film was successful in its storytelling.

The film was released on DVD in 2003.

<doc id="409757" wikidata="Q504564" url="?curid=409757" title="FRELIMO">
<text>FRELIMO (; from , ) is a democratic socialist political party in Mozambique. It has governed the country since its independence from Portugal in 1975.

Founded in 1962, FRELIMO began as a nationalist movement fighting for the self-determination and independence of Mozambique from Portuguese colonial rule. During its anti-colonial struggle, FRELIMO managed to maintain friendly relations with both the Soviet Union and China, and received military and economic assistance from both. Independence was achieved in June 1975 after the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon the previous year. FRELIMO formally became a political party during its 3rd Party Congress in February 1977, and adopted Marxism–Leninism as its official ideology and FRELIMO Party () as its official name.

FRELIMO has been the ruling party of Mozambique since then, initially as the sole legal party in a one-party system and later as the democratically elected government in a dominant-party system. FRELIMO fought a protracted civil war from 1976 to 1992 against the anti-communist Mozambican National Resistance or RENAMO. RENAMO received support from the then white minority governments of Rhodesia and South Africa. FRELIMO approved a new national constitution in 1990, which ended one-party rule and established a multi-party system. FRELIMO has since become the dominant party in Mozambique and has won a majority of the seats in the Assembly of the Republic in every election since the country&#x27;s first multi-party election in 1994.

== History ==

=== War of independence (1964–1974) ===
After World War II, while many European nations were granting independence to their colonies, Portugal, under the Estado Novo regime, maintained that Mozambique and other Portuguese possessions were overseas territories of the metropole (mother country). Emigration to the colonies soared. Calls for Mozambican independence developed rapidly, and in 1962 several anti-colonial political groups formed FRELIMO. In September 1964, it initiated an armed campaign against Portuguese colonial rule. Portugal had ruled Mozambique for more than four hundred years; not all Mozambicans desired independence, and fewer still sought change through armed revolution.

FRELIMO was founded in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, on 25 June 1962, when three regionally based nationalist organizations: the Mozambican African National Union (MANU), National Democratic Union of Mozambique (UDENAMO), and the National African Union of Independent Mozambique (UNAMI) merged into one broad-based guerrilla movement. Under the leadership of Eduardo Mondlane, who was elected president of the newly formed organization, FRELIMO settled its headquarters in 1963 in Dar es Salaam. Uria Simango was its first vice-president.

The movement could not then be based in Mozambique as the Portuguese opposed nationalist movements and the colony was controlled by the police. (The three founding groups had also operated as exiles.) Tanzania and its president, Julius Nyerere, were sympathetic to the Mozambican nationalist groups. Convinced by recent events, such as the Mueda massacre, that peaceful agitation would not bring about independence, FRELIMO contemplated the possibility of armed struggle from the outset. It launched its first offensive in September 1964.

During the ensuing war of independence, FRELIMO received support from the Soviet Union, China, the Scandinavian countries, and some non-governmental organisations in the West. The mobilization of all, regardless of gender, motivated the initial inclusion of women into the war. Initially women were used to carry goods from Tanzania, but over time they were tasked with &quot;making the first contacts with the population in a new area.&quot; Women were expected to engage with the locals and politicize them. This discourse helped legitimize female cadres as real revolutionaries.

Frelimo founded the Women&#x27;s Detachment, a part of the Department of Defense, as a way to encourage the mobilization of women and enlarge Frelimo&#x27;s support. Women cadres brought &quot;a new and decisive force to the revolutionary struggle.&quot;

Frelimo&#x27;s initial military operations were in the North of the country; by the late 1960s it had established &quot;liberated zones&quot; in Northern Mozambique in which it, rather than the Portuguese, constituted the civil authority. In administering these zones, FRELIMO worked to improve the lot of the peasantry in order to receive their support. As liberated areas grew, colonial governmental structures were replaced, as Frelimo activists and local chiefs assumed roles of authority. Traditional leaders were accustomed to controlling “the productive and reproductive capacity of women.” They “rejected women’s rights to participate in armed struggle and defended the bride price system, child marriage and polygamy.” These traditional practices “were all viewed as incompatible with the tenets of revolutionary society.” Over time, traditional power structures were delegitimized by their association with Portuguese colonization and their inability to accommodate key components of revolutionary ideology. Frelimo encouraged the creation of collectives and greatly increased peasant access to education and healthcare. Often FRELIMO soldiers were assigned to medical assistance projects.

Its members&#x27; practical experiences in the liberated zones resulted in the FRELIMO leadership increasingly moving towards a Marxist policy. FRELIMO came to regard economic exploitation by Western capital as the principal enemy of the common Mozambican people, not the Portuguese as such, and not Europeans in general. Although it was an African nationalist party, it adopted a non-racial stance. Numerous white people were members.

The war of liberation was viewed as a rejection of “obstructionist, traditional-feudal and capitalist practices.” The transformation of “social and economic relations” had significant implications for women. Women’s liberation was “not an act of charity,” but rather “a fundamental necessity for the revolution, the guarantee of its continuity and the precondition to its victory.” This perspective recognizes the immense labor force that women constitute. Frelimo acknowledged that women’s involvement in the formal economy would result in an economically stronger Mozambique. The population was encouraged to view women’s emancipation as vital to the amelioration of Mozambique’s society.

The early years of the party, during which its Marxist direction evolved, were times of internal turmoil. Mondlane, along with Marcelino dos Santos, Samora Machel, Joaquim Chissano and a majority of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee promoted the struggle not just for independence but to create a socialist society. The 2nd Party Congress, held in July 1968, approved the socialist goals. Mondlane was reelected party President and Uria Simango was re-elected vice-president.

After Mondlane&#x27;s assassination in February 1969, Uria Simango took over the leadership, but his presidency was disputed. In April 1969, leadership was assumed by a triumvirate, with Machel and Marcelino dos Santos supplementing Simango. After several months, in November 1969, Machel and dos Santos ousted Simango from FRELIMO. Simango left FRELIMO and joined the small Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique (COREMO) liberation movement.

FRELIMO established some &quot;liberated&quot; zones (countryside zones with native rural populations controlled by FRELIMO guerrillas) in Northern Mozambique. The movement grew in strength during the ensuing decade. As FRELIMO&#x27;s political campaign gained coherence, its forces advanced militarily, controlling one-third of the area of Mozambique by 1969, mostly in the northern and central provinces. It was not able to gain control of the cities located inside the &quot;liberated&quot; zones but established itself firmly in the rural regions.

In 1970 the guerrilla movement suffered heavy losses as Portugal launched its ambitious Gordian Knot Operation (&quot;Operação Nó Górdio&quot;), which was masterminded by General Kaúlza de Arriaga of the Portuguese Army. By the early 1970s, FRELIMO&#x27;s 7,000-strong guerrilla force had opened new fronts in central and northern Mozambique.

The April 1974 &quot;Carnation Revolution&quot; in Portugal overthrew the Portuguese Estado Novo regime, and the country turned against supporting the long and draining colonial war in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau. Portugal and FRELIMO negotiated Mozambique&#x27;s independence, which resulted in a transitional government until official independence from Portugal in June 1975.

FRELIMO established a one-party state based on socialist principles, with Samora Machel re-elected as President of FRELIMO and subsequently the First President of the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique. The new government first received diplomatic recognition, economic and military support from Cuba and the Socialist Bloc countries. Marcelino dos Santos became vice-president of FRELIMO and the central committee was expanded.

At the same time FRELIMO had to deal with various small political parties that sprung up and were now contesting for control of Mozambique with FRELIMO along with the reaction of white settlers. Prominent groups included FICO (&quot;I stay&quot; in Portuguese) and the &quot;Dragons of Death&quot; which directly clashed with FRELIMO. Government forces moved in and quickly smashed these movements and arrested various FRELIMO dissidents and Portuguese collaborators who were involved in FICO, the Dragons and other political entities that conspired or aligned against FRELIMO. These included prominent dissidents such as Uria Simango, his wife Celina, Paulo Gumane, Lazaro Nkavandame and Adelino Gwambe.

=== Marxist–Leninist period (1975–1989) ===

Mozambique&#x27;s national anthem from 1975 to 1992 was &quot;&quot; ().

Immediately after independence, Mozambique and FRELIMO faced extraordinarily tough circumstances. The country was bankrupt with almost all of its skilled workforce fleeing or already fled, a 95% illiteracy rate and a brewing counter-revolutionary movement known as the &quot;Mozambique National Resistance&quot; (RENAMO) was beginning its first strikes against key government infrastructure with the assistance of Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesia. As the RENAMO movement grew in strength, FRELIMO and RENAMO began clashing directly in what would quickly turn into the deadly Mozambican Civil War which did not end until 1992.

Large steps had already been taken towards the construction of a Mozambican socialist society by time of the 3rd Party Congress in February 1977, including the nationalisation of the land, many agricultural, industrial and commercial enterprises, rented housing, the banks, health and education.

FRELIMO transformed itself into a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party of the worker-peasant alliance at the congress. The congress laid down firmly that the political and economic guidelines for the development of the economy and the society would be for the benefit of all Mozambicans. FRELIMO was also restructured extensively, the central committee expanding to over 200 members and the transformation of FRELIMO from a front into a formal political party, adopting the name &quot;Partido FRELIMO&quot; (FRELIMO Party).

FRELIMO began extensive programs for economic development, healthcare and education. Healthcare and Education became free and universal to all Mozambicans and the government begun a mass program of immunisations which was praised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the most successful ever initiated in Africa. The scheme reached over 90% of the Mozambican Population in the first five years and led to a 20% drop in infant mortality rates. Illiteracy rates dropped from 95% in 1975 to 73% in 1978. Those who were previously denied access to education because of class, gender, or race were exposed to education. Frelimo’s dedication to accessible education had long-lasting consequences as previously marginalized groups, such as women, were able to engage intellectually and be involved in formal political and economic structures for the first time.

Despite the difficult situation and economic chaos the Mozambican economy grew appreciably from the period of 1977–1983.

However, some serious setbacks occurred, with particular force in the years 1982–1984. Neighbouring states, firstly Rhodesia and then South Africa, made direct armed incursions and promoted the growing RENAMO insurgency which continued to carry out economic sabotage and terrorism against the population. Natural disasters compounded the already devastating situation, with large scale floods in some regions from Tropical Storm Domoina in 1984, followed by extensive droughts.

Some of FRELIMO&#x27;s more ambitious policies also caused further stress to the economy. Particularly FRELIMO&#x27;s agricultural policy from 1977–1983 which placed heavy emphasis on state farms and neglected smaller peasant and community farms caused discontent among many peasant farmers and led to a reduction in production. At the 4th Party Congress in 1984 FRELIMO acknowledged its mistakes in the economic field and adopted a new set of directives and plans, reversing their previous positions and promoting more peasant and communal based farming projects over the larger state farms, many of which were either dismantled or shrunk.

As the war with RENAMO intensified much of the improvements made to healthcare, education and basic infrastructure by FRELIMO were wiped out. Agriculture fell into disarray as farms were burnt and farmers fled into the cities for safety, industrial production slowed as many workers were conscripted into battle against RENAMO and frequent raids against key roads and railways caused economic chaos across the country. FRELIMO&#x27;s focus rapidly shifted from socialist construction to maintaining a basic level of infrastructure and protecting the towns and cities as best they could. Despite small scale reforms in the party and state and the growing war Machel continued to maintain a hardline Marxist–Leninist stance and refused to negotiate with RENAMO.

In 1986 while returning from a meeting with Zaire and Malawi, President Samora Machel died in a suspicious airplane crash many blamed on the apartheid regime in Pretoria. In the immediate aftermath the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of FRELIMO assumed the duties of President of FRELIMO and President of Mozambique until a successor could be elected. Joaquim Alberto Chissano was elected as the President of FRELIMO and was inaugurated as the Second President of the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique on 6 November 1986. Despite being considered a &quot;Moderate Marxist&quot; Chissano initially maintained Machel&#x27;s hardline stance against RENAMO but begun economic reforms with the adoption of The World Bank and IMF&#x27;s &quot;Economic Rehabilitation Program&quot; (ERP) in September 1987. By 1988 Chissano had relented on his hardliner position and begun seeking third party negotiations with RENAMO to end the conflict.

In 1989 at the 5th Party Congress, FRELIMO officially dropped all references to Marxism–Leninism and class struggle from its party directives and documents, and democratic socialism was adopted as the official ideology of FRELIMO while talks continued with RENAMO to broker a ceasefire.

=== Movement towards democratic socialism (1989–2000) ===

With the removal of the final vestiges of Marxism from FRELIMO at the 5th Party Congress, greater economic reform programs commenced with the help of the World Bank, IMF and various international donors. FRELIMO also believed it needed to reduce all traces of socialist influence, this resulted in the removal of hardline Marxists such as Sergio Viera, Jorge Rebelo and Marcelino dos Santos from positions of power and influence within the party. Additionally FRELIMO began to revise the history of the Mozambican War of Independence to distort it to suit FRELIMO&#x27;s new, contradictory pro-capitalist beliefs.

In 1990 a revised constitution was adopted which introduced a multi-party system to Mozambique and ended one-party rule. The revisions also removed all references to socialism from the constitution and resulted in the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique being renamed to the Republic of Mozambique.

The civil war conflict continued under a lessened pace until 1992 when the Rome General Peace Accords was signed. United Nations&#x27; peacekeeping operation started in 1992 and ended in 1994, helping to end the civil war. With the end of the civil war elections were scheduled for 1994 under the new pluralistic system. FRELIMO and RENAMO campaigned heavily for the elections. FRELIMO ultimately won the elections with 53.3% of the vote with an 88% voter turnout. RENAMO contested the election results and threatened to return to violence, however, under both internal and external pressure RENAMO eventually accepted the results.

In 1992 Frelimo implemented a voluntary quota system like many other &quot;post-conflict countries that had left-leaning parties in power with longstanding commitments to gender equality.&quot; Frelimo’s quota system requires that 30% of the candidates running for the National Assembly under Frelimo’s leadership must be women. There is “equal distribution of women’s names (every third name is a woman’s) through the candidate lists.” Equal distribution on lists are called “zebra lists” and this type of list has proven to be important to the success of quota systems. The adoption of the quota system has resulted in steady growth since its implementation. In 1994 women made up 26% of the national parliament, in 1999 they made up 30%, and in 2004, women won 35%, in 2015 women won 40% of the parliamentary seats. Mozambique is ranked twelfth in the world and fourth in Africa for women’s involvement in its national parliament.

Throughout the mid to late 1990s, FRELIMO moved towards democratic socialist views (officially adopting it at the 10th Party Congress), as further liberalisation continued the government received further support and aid from countries such as the United Kingdom and United States. Mozambique became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, despite not being a former British colony, for its role in ensuring the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980.

In the 1999 general election, Chissano was re-elected as President of Mozambique with 52.3% of the vote, while FRELIMO secured 133 of 250 parliamentary seats.

=== 21st century ===


In early 2001 Chissano announced his intention to not stand for the 2004 presidential election, although the constitution permitted him to do so.

In 2002, during its 8th Congress, the party selected Armando Guebuza as its candidate for the presidential election held on 1–2 December 2004. As expected given FRELIMO&#x27;s majority status, he won, gaining about 60% of the vote. At the legislative elections of the same date, the party won 62.0% of the popular vote and 160 of 250 seats in the national assembly.

RENAMO and some other opposition parties made claims of election fraud and denounced the result. International observers (among others, members of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Mozambique and the Carter Center) supported these claims, criticizing the National Electoral Commission (CNE) for failing to conduct fair and transparent elections. They listed numerous cases of improper conduct by the electoral authorities that benefited FRELIMO. However, the EU observers concluded that the elections shortcomings probably did not affect the presidential election&#x27;s final result.

<text>The Watts Towers, Towers of Simon Rodia, or Nuestro Pueblo (&quot;our town&quot; in Spanish) are a collection of 17 interconnected sculptural towers, architectural structures, and individual sculptural features and mosaics within the site of the artist&#x27;s original residential property in Watts, Los Angeles, California, United States. The entire site of towers, structures, sculptures, pavement, and walls were designed and built solely by Sabato (&quot;Simon&quot; or &quot;Sam&quot;) Rodia (1879 or 1886 to 1965), an Italian immigrant construction worker and tile mason, over a period of 33 years from 1921 to 1954. The tallest of the towers is . The work is an example of outsider art (or Art Brut) and Italian-American naïve art.

The Watts Towers were designated a National Historic Landmark and a California Historical Landmark in 1990. They are also a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, and one of nine folk art sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles. The Watts Towers of Simon Rodia State Historic Park encompasses the Watts Towers site.

==Simon Rodia==
Sabato (&quot;Simon&quot; or &quot;Sam&quot;) Rodia (12 February, 1878 – July 17, 1965) was born and raised in Serino, Italy. In 1895, aged seventeen, he emigrated to the United States with his brother. Rodia lived in Pennsylvania until his brother died in a mining incident. He then moved to Seattle, Washington, where he married Lucia Ucci in 1902. They soon moved to Oakland, where Rodia&#x27;s three children were born. Following his divorce around 1909, he moved to Long Beach and worked in construction and other odd jobs before finally settling in Watts in 1920. Among the projects he is known, or claimed, to have worked on are the UC Berkeley campus, the Eastern Star Home and the Bullocks Wilshire building. Rodia began constructing the Watts Towers in 1921.

There has been some question as to what Rodia was called during his lifetime; some sources have cited that his birth name was &quot;Sabatino&quot; and it is disputed as to whether he was called &quot;Simon&quot; during his lifetime. It is widely known and accepted that he was referred to as &quot;Sam&quot; by close friends. He appears as Samuel Rodia (and still living in Oakland) in the 1910 U.S. Census, but by the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, he had already become Sam Rodia. His surname has also been misspelled as &quot;Rodella&quot; or &quot;Rodilla&quot;.

==Design and construction==
The sculptures&#x27; armatures are constructed from steel rebar and Rodia&#x27;s own concoction of a type of concrete, wrapped with wire mesh. The main supports are embedded with pieces of porcelain, tile, and glass. They are decorated with found objects, including bottles, ceramic tiles, seashells, figurines, mirrors, and other items. Rodia called the Towers &quot;Nuestro Pueblo&quot; (&quot;our town&quot; in Spanish). He built them with no special equipment or predetermined design, working alone with hand tools. Neighborhood children brought pieces of broken pottery to Rodia, and he also used damaged pieces from Malibu Potteries and CALCO (California Clay Products Company). Green glass includes recognizable soft drink bottles from the 1930s through the 1950s, some still bearing the former logos of 7 Up, Squirt, Bubble Up, and Canada Dry; blue glass appears to be from milk of magnesia bottles. Their structural design and placement near the builder&#x27;s home are strongly reminiscent of the &quot;gigli&quot; (&quot;lillies&quot;) towers which feature in an annual festival to St. Paulinus in Nola, Italy, with which he was probably familiar.

Rodia bent much of the Towers&#x27; framework from scrap rebar, using nearby railroad tracks as a makeshift vise. Other items came from alongside the Pacific Electric Railway right-of-way between Watts and Wilmington. Rodia often walked the right-of-way all the way to Wilmington in search of material, a distance of nearly .

In the summer of 1954, Rodia suffered a mild stroke. Shortly after the stroke, he fell off a tower from a low height. In 1955, Rodia gave his property to a neighbor and left, reportedly tired of battling with the City of Los Angeles for permits, and because he understood the possible consequences of his aging and being alone. He also mentioned that the towers were frequently vandalized by neighbors. He moved to Martinez, California, to be with his sister. He remained there for the next eleven years until his death in 1965.

==Preservation after Rodia==
Rodia&#x27;s bungalow inside the enclosure burned down as a result of an accident on the Fourth of July 1956, and the City of Los Angeles condemned the structure and ordered it all to be destroyed. Actor Nicholas King and film editor William Cartwright visited the site in 1959, and purchased the property from Rodia&#x27;s neighbor for $2,000 in order to preserve it. The city&#x27;s decision to pursue expediting the demolition was still in force. The towers had already become famous and there was opposition from around the world. King, Cartwright, architects, artists, enthusiasts, academics, and community activists formed the Committee for Simon Rodia&#x27;s Towers in Watts. The committee negotiated with the city to allow for an engineering test to establish the safety of the structures and avoid their demolition.

Tests conducted October 10, 1959, found that the towers were capable of withstanding lateral forces of up to 10,000 pounds.

=== Conservation and damage ===
The Committee for Simon Rodia&#x27;s Towers preserved the site independently until 1975 when, for the purpose of guardianship, they partnered with the City of Los Angeles and then with the State of California in 1978. The Towers are operated by the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and curated by the Watts Towers Arts Center/Charles Mingus Youth Arts Center, which grew out of the Youth Arts Classes originally established in the house structure.

In February 2011, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art received a grant from the James Irvine Foundation to scientifically assess and report on the condition of the Watts Towers, to continue to preserve the undisturbed structural integrity and composition of the aging works of art. Weather and moisture caused pieces of tile and glass to become loose on the towers, which are conserved for reattachment in the ongoing restoration work. The structures suffered little from the 1994 Northridge earthquake in the region, with only a few pieces shaken loose. An extensive restoration project by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art began in 2017. The site re-opened in November 2022 when the work was finished.

=== California Historic Landmark marker ===
California Historic Landmark Marker on the site reads:
NO. 993 WATTS TOWERS OF SIMON RODIA – The Watts Towers are perhaps the nation&#x27;s best known work of folk art sculpture. Using simple hand tools, cast off materials (glass, shell, pottery pieces and broken tile) Italian immigrant Simon Rodia spent 30 years building a tribute to his adopted country and a monument to the spirit of individuals who make their dreams tangible. Rodia&#x27;s Towers inspired many to rally and preserve his work and protect it for the future.


== Special exhibits ==
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art mounted a 1962 photographic exhibition, &quot;Simon Rodia’s Towers in Watts: A Photographic Exhibition&quot;, which was the first museum exhibition on the art or Simon Rodia and the towers.

Two artist interviews, &quot;Watts Towers Q&amp;A with Dominique Moody&quot; and &quot;Q&amp;A With Artist Alison Saar About Her Connection to Watts Towers,&quot; were produced in 2012 by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as part of its Exhibitions on View series.

== In popular culture ==

The Simon Rodia Continuation High School in Watts is named for Simon Rodia.

=== Literature ===
Jazz musician Charles Mingus mentioned Rodia&#x27;s Towers in his 1971 autobiography &quot;Beneath the Underdog&quot;, writing about his childhood fascination with Rodia and his work. There is also a reference to the work in Don DeLillo&#x27;s novel &quot;Underworld&quot;.

California-based poet Robert Duncan featured Rodia&#x27;s Towers in his 1959 poem, &quot;Nel Mezzo del Cammin di Nostra Vita,&quot; as an example of democratic art that is free of church/state power structures.

In her 1974 book, &quot;Eve&#x27;s Hollywood,&quot; Eve Babitz describes a visit to the towers.

In his book &quot;White Sands&quot; Geoff Dyer writes about his visit to the Watts Towers in the chapter &quot;The Ballad of Jimmy Garrison&quot;.

The short story &quot;With Virgil Oddum At The East Pole&quot; by an American science fiction writer Harlan Ellison is directly inspired by the Watts Towers and dedicated to the memory of Sabotini Rodia. The story placed first in the 1986 Locus Award for Best Short Story.

===Film===
* The 1957 short documentary film &quot;The Towers&quot;, by William Hale, includes voice recordings of Rodia and footage of the artist at work. The film incorrectly refers to the artist as &quot;Simon Rodilla&quot;. The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2009.

==Watts Towers Arts Center==
The Watts Towers Arts Center is an adjacent community arts center. The current facility opened in 1970. Before that, the Center operated under a canopy next to the Towers. The center was built and staffed by the non-profit Committee for Simon Rodia&#x27;s Towers in Watts. Changing displays of contemporary artworks are on exhibit, and tours of the Watts Towers are conducted by the center. The center&#x27;s Charles Mingus Youth Arts Center holds art classes, primarily for youth and Special Needs adults from the local community and surrounding cities. Partnerships with CalArts and Sony Pictures provide media arts and piano classes. The Day of the Drum and Jazz Festival occurs annually on the last weekend of every September. It includes arts and craft booths and live music.

<doc id="409766" wikidata="Q975090" url="?curid=409766" title="Sarita, Texas">
<text>Sarita is a census-designated place (CDP) in, and the county seat of Kenedy County, Texas, United States. It is the only settlement of note in the county, and as of the 2010 census had a population of 238. 

==History==
In 1904, the town of Sarita, Texas was founded on land that had been part of Kenedy Ranch. John G. Kenedy named the town after his daughter Sarita Kenedy East. The town served the Kenedy Pasture Company and Kenedy Ranch and its employees. The company store, ranch offices, and ranch buildings have been located in Sarita. Most of the residents were somehow involved in the Kenedy businesses, either as employees or tenant cotton farmers from Kenedy Pasture Company. The Kenedy Ranch Museum, with art and artifacts about the history of the Kenedy family in South Texas, opened in 2003 in the newly restored Kenedy Pasture Company building.

In an article in 2014, Sarita was ranked the most politically liberal town in Texas.

===&quot;Occupation&quot; hoax===
In 2014, a fake news website called &quot;National Report&quot; published an article claiming that a militia of &quot;over one hundred armed La Raza militants&quot; had occupied Sarita, forcing original residents out of their homes and using the town as a base of operations. The hoax report circled on the Internet.

==Geography==
Sarita is located in northern Kenedy County at 27°13′18″N, 97°47′21″W. It is along U.S. Route 77, south of Kingsville, south of Corpus Christi, and north of Harlingen. The United States Border Patrol Sarita checkpoint on US 77 is located some south of the town of Sarita.

===Cityscape===
Gary Cartwright of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said that Sarita&#x27;s only landmarks were a green sign reading &quot;Sarita&quot;, a water tower, and a blinking yellow light. Sarita has an elementary school and a Catholic church. Sarita does not have any convenience stores, shops, or cafes. The nearest grocery store is in Kingsville, though there are convenience stores at gas stations in Riviera, to the north along US 77. The nearest major medical center is in Corpus Christi.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Sarita has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
Sarita first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 205 people, 129 households, and 115 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
Sarita Elementary School (PreK-6) of the Kenedy County Wide Common School District serves Sarita.

Students who graduate from Sarita Elementary move on to De La Paz Middle School and Kaufer Early College High School, operated by Riviera Independent School District, which takes all secondary students from the KCWCSD area.

All of Kenedy County is in the area of Del Mar College, according to the Texas Education Code.

<text>The Battle of the Sabis also (arguably erroneously) known as the Battle of the Sambre or the Battle against the Nervians (or Nervii) was fought in 57 BC near modern Saulzoir in Northern France, between Caesar&#x27;s legions and an association of Belgae tribes, principally the Nervii. Julius Caesar, commanding the Roman forces, was surprised and nearly defeated. According to Caesar&#x27;s report, a combination of determined defence, skilled generalship, and the timely arrival of reinforcements allowed the Romans to turn a strategic defeat into a tactical victory. Few primary sources describe the battle in detail, with most information coming from Caesar&#x27;s own report on the battle from his book, &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. Little is therefore known about the Nervii perspective on the battle.

==Prelude==
During the winter of 58–57 BC rumours came to Caesar&#x27;s ears that the Belgae tribes were forming a union because they feared possible Roman interference in their affairs. The union included the Bellovaci, Suessiones, Nervii, Atrebates, Ambiani, Morini, Menapii, Caleti, Veliocasses, Viromandui, Aduatuci, Condrusi, Eburones, Caeroesi, and Paemani tribes, and was under the leadership of Galba, a king of the Suessiones. These reports provided Caesar with a good pretext for conquering more than Gaul &quot;itself&quot;, and for this, he raised two legions in Cisalpine Gaul (XIII and XIV) and convinced the Remi tribe to side with him.

In response, the other Belgae and Celtic tribes had attacked Bibrax (the oppidum of the Remi, situated near the river Aisne). Caesar countered by defending the oppidum and winning an action at the Aisne. In the face of this and because of shortage of provisions, the union collapsed and tribal armies retreated to their own lands, with the agreed future intention of coming to the support of any tribe invaded by the Romans. Caesar continued his advance and tribes surrendered one by one. However, four tribes, the Nervii, the Atrebates, the Aduatuci, and the Viromandui refused to submit.

The Ambiani told Caesar that the Nervii were the most hostile of the Belgae to Roman rule. A fierce and brave tribe, they did not allow the import of luxury items as they believed these had a corrupting effect and probably feared Roman influence. They had no intention of entering peace negotiations with the Romans. Caesar would move on them next.

==Forces==
As with all ancient battles, estimates of the forces available to both sides will always be a matter of some speculation. A Roman legion during this era had a theoretical strength of some 4,800 fighting men with additional auxiliary forces (usually skirmishers and cavalry). Eight Roman legions plus an unknown number of auxiliary (skirmishers: archers, slingers and javelinmen) and allied cavalry are recorded to have taken part in the battle. It is not known if the legions were at full strength, but a reasonable estimate for Caesar&#x27;s army might be in the range of 30,000–45,000 fighting men (including skirmishers and cavalry). The 30,000–45,000 range does not include non-combatants, although, in this case, they participated in the fighting during the final phase of the battle. A legion was usually accompanied by some 1,200 non-combatants (theoretically) so their numbers could have been 9,000-10,000 men.

Caesar claims he had earlier received intelligence from the Remi that the various tribes of the Belgae had promised to contribute a total of 300,000 fighting men. According to Caesar the Remi estimates of the men promised by the four tribes now left to oppose Caesar were: 50,000 Nervii, 15,000 Atrebates, 10,000 Veromandui and 19,000 Aduatuci. If these figures were reliable it would mean that Caesar was immediately faced with a maximum of 75,000 men, as the Aduatuci were still en route. Promises are not always kept so it is probable the actual number was smaller than this, though still high enough to outnumber the legionaries.

===Order of battle===

Roman Republic – Julius Caesar&#x27;s eight legions: VII, VIII, IX &quot;Triumphalis&quot;, X &quot;Equestris&quot;, XI, XII &quot;Victrix&quot;, XIII, XIV – auxiliaries: slingers, archers, javelinmen and cavalry. The IX and X legions formed the left flank, the VIII and the XI were in the centre, and the VII and XII were on the right.

The Belgae attacked with the Atrebates forming the right wing, the Viromandui in the centre, and the Nervi on the left.

Traditionally it was believed that the battle was fought on the banks of the river Sambre, near modern Aulnoye-Aymeries, but in 1955 Turquin showed that it was fought on the west bank of the river Selle, near modern Saulzoir.

==Before the battle==
Caesar&#x27;s legions had been marching in Nervian territory for three days, following an ancient road. He learnt from prisoners that the Belgae were massing on the far side of the River Sabis, which was about ahead. The Nervii had persuaded the Atrebates and the Veromandui to support them. The Aduatuci were marching to join them, but they did not arrive in time to take part in the battle. Their non-combatants had moved to a safe area screened by marshes, where an army could not approach. The Belgae had made their preparations and were now waiting for the Romans.

Caesar sent forward experienced scouts to choose the next campsite.

He learnt from prisoners taken later that sympathisers in the ragtag of surrendered Belgae and other Gauls travelling with the army had gone to the Nervii and reported the disposition of his column. They reported that the individual legionary baggage trains were interspersed between the legions and that it would be easy to cut off the leading legion from the rest and destroy it before any support could reach it. It was believed this would intimidate the Romans into withdrawing. The Nervii, having traditionally always relied on infantry rather than cavalry, had over the years developed a technique of building dense, impenetrable hedges of briars and thorns set between young trees as a defence against the raids of surrounding tribes. These would obstruct Caesar&#x27;s advance and help the attack. It was agreed that the signal for an attack was to be the appearance of the baggage train behind the first legion. In doing this, the Nervii were intending to use what is recognisable today as the modern army doctrine of force concentration. As will be seen, their plan would be frustrated by Caesar.

==Battle==
The campsite was to be laid out on a hill which gently sloped down to the river. On the other side of the river there was another hill directly opposite, similarly sloping. The top of that hill was densely wooded but the lower part was open and sloped down to the river over a distance of 200 paces (roughly ). The enemy was concealed inside the woods, but a few cavalry pickets could be seen in the open area by the river. The river was very wide, but only about three feet (one metre) deep.

At some point on his march to the Sabis, Caesar reorganised the column and reverted to his usual tactic of leading his forces with six legions in light marching order. Behind them was the baggage column of the entire army, followed by the newly recruited legions, XIII and XIV. Caesar does not say whether this change was fortuitous or was made in response to the intelligence received. While Caesar&#x27;s force began to set up camp on the slope running down to the river, his cavalry, together with slingers and archers, was ordered to cross the river to reconnoiter. This developed into a skirmish with the few troops of Belgic cavalry that had been observed on the far side. Caesar describes the enemy cavalry as sallying repeatedly from the woods at the top of the hill and says his cavalry did not dare follow them in when they retreated. He does not elaborate further so it will never be known if the Nervii were trying to entice the skirmishers onto their hidden position or holding them in play on the slopes in preparation for the planned rush.

Meanwhile, the legions had started arriving at the camp site and began to build its fortifications. The Belgae, waiting for the baggage train to appear, gradually found themselves faced with not one legion, but six. Their plan of piecemeal destruction had to be abandoned, but they must have believed their numbers more than adequate to deal with their enemy.

===Ambush===
As the Roman baggage train came into view, the Belgic force suddenly rushed out of the trees and surprised their opponents, overwhelming the Roman cavalry. They crossed the shallow river at full speed and charged up the hill against the legions setting up camp, giving them no time to get into battle formation. It seemed to Caesar that the Nervii came on with incredible speed, all at once pouring out of the trees, charging across the river and overrunning his legionaries.

Taken by surprise, Caesar had to rapidly give orders to sound the alarm both by raising the battle-standard and by trumpet, get his men away from construction work, recall the wood-cutting parties, and try to get his legions into some semblance of order. There was very little time and much had to be left undone. Two things, though, saved the legions from being immediately routed—firstly, the knowledge and experience of the soldiers (which meant that they could decide for themselves what to do without waiting for orders) and secondly, Caesar had previously ordered all legion commanders to stay with their legions during the setting up of the camp.

Caesar went wherever he was needed, giving only essential orders and eventually found himself on the left wing with Legion X. Seeing that the enemy were within range of the Romans he gave the order to hurl a volley of pilae. Going to another part of the field, he found his men already fighting. The men had run from their building tasks to fall into ranks but many did not even have time to put on their helmets or take the covers off their shields. The legionaries had no opportunity to group with their own cohorts and instead congregated around the first friendly standard they saw. Caesar states that the hedges were a considerable obstruction to his men during the battle, although he does not specify their locations on the field, but the woody hilltop is the one place we can infer their presence.

The soldiers of legions X &quot;Equestris&quot; and IX &quot;Triumphalis&quot; on the left flank, having thrown their pilae at their Atrebates opponents, charged. They threw the enemy back and drove them into the river, killing many. The Romans crossed the river and found themselves on disadvantageous or uneven ground, but although the Atrebates regrouped and launched a counter-attack, the Romans put them to flight a second time. Further along, in the centre, two legions, XI and VIII, having checked the Viromandui with whom they were engaged, pushed them from the higher ground into the river.

However, as these four legions pushed their opponents back, the front and left of the camp was left undefended and a gap opened up in the Roman line. A compact column of Nervii under Boduognatus (the overall commander of the Belgae) rushed through the opening. Part of the column turned to encircle the two legions holding the right flank; the rest continued upwards to attack the higher part of the camp.

===Crisis===
Meanwhile, the routed Roman cavalry and skirmishers were just straggling into camp when they found themselves face to face with the Nervii – they ran again. Camp followers further up the hill by the camp&#x27;s back gate had observed the success of the Romans at the river and came down in the hope of plunder, but noticed the Nervii in the camp and also ran. People accompanying the baggage train just arriving were horrified at the sight before them and panicked as well. Even the usually-dependable Treveri cavalry arriving to support the Romans looked at the seemingly hopeless situation and promptly turned for home to report the disaster.

After encouraging Legion X Caesar went to the right wing. The situation seemed desperate. He could see that the men of XII &quot;Victrix&quot; were crammed so closely together into one mass by their standards that they could not fight effectively. All (six) centurions of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed, and the standard missing. Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus, the legion&#x27;s primipilus, a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. Caesar could see some men were shirking and trying to get to the rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and went to the first line. Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance (signa inferre) and the maniples open up and extend. As he tells it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers’ morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general. As a result, the enemy assault was checked slightly.

===Recovery===
Caesar saw that Legion VII nearby was also hard-pressed. He ordered the tribunes to redeploy the two legions to gradually join and fight back to back. This further increased his men&#x27;s confidence. By now, the legions escorting the baggage, having received a report of the action, had come on at double pace and the enemy could see them coming over the hill above the camp. Legion X, under legate Labienus, had overcome the Atrebates, crossed the river, and defeated the Belgic reserves. Now they seized the Belgic camp on the wooded hill. From the higher ground, Labienus could see that Caesar&#x27;s right wing was in serious trouble. He ordered his men back across the river to attack the Nervii from the rear.

Soon Legions XIII and XIV joined the fight. Caesar does not detail their actions, but they probably cleared the camp (as it was their nearest target) and went to the right to relieve the pressure on Legions XII and VII. This, coupled with the return of Legion X, transformed the situation. Seeing the position begin to stabilise, cavalry and skirmishers took heart and, keen to wipe out their earlier shame, started to fight in earnest. The camp followers joined in now that they could see their enemy&#x27;s dismay. The entire Roman force was now fully committed.

At this point of the battle it is clear that Caesar&#x27;s opposition had little hope of survival. They were being pushed closer and closer into a dense pack that was being surrounded by Caesar&#x27;s men who were using projectile weapons to pick off their remaining forces. Using peltasts (a light infantry) equipped with slings and javelins, and with the help of archers, they unleashed a barrage of missiles at the closely packed Nervii. The last of them fought with ferocity and courage for they were continuing to retaliate with their spears and catching the Romans javelins and throwing them back at them. The Nervii hadn&#x27;t used any other projectile type weapon except for spears. The Nervii warriors fought to the last, standing on the bodies of their slain comrades, and throwing the Romans’ own spears back at them. Eventually the few remaining Nervii broke and fled the field.

Caesar&#x27;s opinion of the Nervii was that they had shown great fighting spirit in carrying an attack forward so vigorously on to difficult ground and in continuing to fight stubbornly when the tide of battle turned irretrievably against them. Caesar talks of a grimly inspiring image of the last of the Nervii who were atop a mound of corpses of their own warriors and shouting in defiance towards the Romans, fighting till their last breath. He goes on to say that they had outstanding courage, for they launched a surprise attack, crossed a river up its banks, then rushed on to attack all with a fighting spirit. He glorifies his victory by stating how well his army did without having to be ordered to launch a counter-attack. It is probable that his soldiers were experienced veterans who were able to hold off their onslaught. He evidently mitigates his losses by not mentioning the Roman casualties, or conceding that they were in serious danger of defeat, as appears to have been the case. While Caesar appears to give a relatively frank account of the course of the battle, in &quot;The Conquest of Gaul&quot;, this remains one of the only primary sources. And since it was written by Caesar, much is unknown of the Nervii&#x27;s perspective, such as the extent to which Boduognatus planned the attack and directed his forces during the battle.

==Casualties==
The older men of the Nervii, described by Caesar as “senators”, came out of their hiding place in the marshland and surrendered. They said that their council had been reduced from 600 men to three and that of 60,000 fighting men there were barely 500 left. It is not entirely clear if this is a figure for the dead or if it includes wounded, nor is it clear if these are solely Nervii casualties or if the figure includes their allies. Caesar states that he spared the Nervii and ordered the surrounding tribes not to take advantage of their weakness.

Caesar gives no indication of his own casualties.

==Aftermath==
The Aduatuci turned for home as soon as they heard about the defeat. They were subsequently defeated by Caesar and some 53,000 of them sold into slavery.

The Veneti, the Unelli, the Osismii, the Curiosolitae, the Sesuvii, the Aulerci and the Rhedones were all brought under Roman control following the battle.

In 54 BC Ambiorix persuaded the Nervii to join the Eburones after the latter had destroyed a legion and five cohorts under Sabinus and Cotta during the Ambiorix&#x27;s revolt.

During Vercingetorix&#x27;s revolt (52 BC) the Nervii were only asked to supply 5,000 men to the forces raised by a confederation of over forty tribes.

<text>Baby Point is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bounded on the west by the Humber River from south of Baby Point Crescent to St. Marks Road, east to Jane Street and Jane Street south to Raymond Avenue and Raymond Avenue west to the Humber. It is within the city-defined neighbourhood of &#x27;Lambton-Baby Point&#x27;. Baby Point is within the proximity of Jane station.

The neighbourhood was at one time an Iroquois village, called Teiaiagon. The village had a population of 5000 at its peak. In the 19th century, lawyer James Baby bought the land from the Upper Canada government, which had bought it as part of the Toronto Purchase. The land was developed into the current neighbourhood in the early 20th century as part of York Township. The name is pronounced by locals as &quot;Bobby&quot; or &quot;Babby&quot;to rhyme with tabby or cabbiein an approximation of how James Baby pronounced his surname.

==History==
The Baby Point enclave was originally a Seneca and Mohawk village, known as &quot;Teiaiagon&quot;. The village was abandoned before 1700 after the Mississauga drove out the Iroquois to lands south of Lake Ontario. For a short time, the Mississauga had a village at the site. 

James Baby, pronounced &#x27;Babby&#x27;, was a member of a prominent Franco-Ontarian fur trading family and a former politician in Upper Canada. He settled at Baby Point in 1816, after discovering the abandoned village. A lush apple orchard covered the area and salmon swam in the Humber River making this a highly desirable area for settlement. Water from a fresh spring nearby was bottled and shipped worldwide.

Many streets in this neighbourhood are named after Baby&#x27;s family. His heirs lived at Baby Point until 1910, when the government acquired the land with the intention of establishing a military base and barracks at the site. The government eventually changed their plans and sold the land to a developer named Home Smith, who began developing a subdivision in 1912. Home Smith would later develop a residential area across the Humber, The Kingsway.

The neighbourhood was part of the former City of York before the amalgamation of Toronto in 1998. The area began as two independent municipalities.

In 2010, local merchants formed the Baby Point Gates Business Improvement Area (a board under the City of Toronto) which runs along Jane St from Montye Ave in the north, to Lessard Ave in the south, and along Annette St from Jane St in the west, to Windermere Ave in the east.

In July 2020 temporary plaques were placed on Baby Point Rd. and in front of the Baby Point Club informing the residents their neighbourhood is named in honour of an important local historical figure that fought to keep slavery and was a slave owner himself. It became a topic of social justice discussion on Twitter by local activists.

==Character==

Stone gates at the intersection of Jane Street and Baby Point Road mark the entrance to the Baby Point enclave. The gates were restored in 2011 by the Baby Point BIA. The homes are single-family detached. The average price of a home in the Baby Point area is valued at $2,400,800.

Baby Point is situated on a peninsula of land—or a &#x27;point&#x27; -- overlooking the Humber River. It is surrounded by ravines and parkland. The larger homes tend to back onto the Humber Valley ravine and are found along Baby Point Road and Baby Point Crescent, while the smaller homes are found near the Jane Street and Baby Point Road entrance. Most of the homes in the enclave were built in the 1920s and 1930s. In the center of the loop of Baby Point Road/Baby Point Crescent is the private Baby Point Club Park, used by the private Baby Point Club for tennis and lawn bowling.

==Demographics==
According to a 2019 statistics report, the Baby Point area had a population of 1,461 with a population density of 2,822 per square kilometre, 40% lower than Toronto as a whole. 79% of residents being married couples, 55% with children living at home, and the median age of the area resting at 41.2 years. Median earnings were at $160,206 per year, 110% higher than the national average. The unemployment rate is also 55% lower than the national average. Visible minority populations are lower than Toronto average with 3.6% Black, 3.3% South Asian, 2.8% Chinese.

In 2016 Neighbourhood Profile, 69% of Lambton Baby Point residents had English as the Mother Tongue.

==Notable residents==
* Conn Smythe - owner and manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and his family, were long-time residents of Baby Point Road.
* Raymond Souster - Canadian poet (often described as Toronto&#x27;s unofficial poet laureate), lived for many years on Baby Point Road.

<text>Bruno of Augsburg (or &quot;Brun&quot;) &quot;von Bayern&quot; ( – 1029) was the son of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria (the Wrangler or Quarrelsome) and Gisela of Burgundy. He was the younger brother of Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor of Germany, the only Holy Roman Emperor to be made a saint. He and his brother were tutored by Wolfgang of Regensburg.

Bruno later became a canon of Hildesheim. In 1003 Bruno supported the revolt of Henry of Schweinfurt, Margrave of the Nordgau against his brother. When the revolt failed, Bruno fled to Bohemia and then stayed for a time at the court of his brother-in-law, King Stephen I of Hungary. He was reconciled to his brother in early 1004, through the efforts of Stephen I of Hungary.

Bruno served as chancellor for a year before being elected Bishop of Augsburg in 1006, a post he held until 1029. As a bishop, he encouraged King Stephen I of Hungary&#x27;s efforts to convert rebellious pagans to the new faith.

The diocese of Augsburg attained great splendour under Bishop Bruno (1006–1029); he restored a number of ruined monasteries, founded the church and college of St. Maurice, placed Benedictine monks in the collegiate church of St. Afra, and added to the episcopal possessions by the gift of his own inheritance of Straubing.

Bruno was exiled in 1024, possibly over a disagreement with Henry I over the founding of the Diocese of Bamberg. Bruno later became an important adviser to Emperor Conrad II. In 1026, Bruno was named regent in Germany during Conrad&#x27;s expedition in Italy. That same year Henry V, Duke of Bavaria, brother of Henry II&#x27;s wife Cunigunde of Luxembourg, died without issue. Bruno was the closest related heir, but as an ecclesiastic could not claim the title. Before leaving for Italy, Conrad II named his son Henry III as his heir, and recognising the Bishop as an experienced statesman, named Bruno Henry&#x27;s guardian and tutor. During Conrad II&#x27;s absence, Welf II, Count of Swabia sacked and pillaged the city of Augsburg, seising the Bishop&#x27;s treasury. Bruno escaped across the Alps, taking the young Henry with him, and joined Conrad II in Italy. Upon Conrad II&#x27;s return, Welf II was imprisoned and compelled to make restitution. Conrad II named his son Henry III, Duke of Bavaria. Herwig Wolfram suggests that Bruno&#x27;s appointment as young Henry III&#x27;s guardian was in anticipation of this.

Bishop Bruno died in Regensburg in 1029 and was buried in the church of Saint Maurice in Augsburg.

<text>The Kimberley is the northernmost of the nine regions of Western Australia. It is bordered on the west by the Indian Ocean, on the north by the Timor Sea, on the south by the Great Sandy and Tanami deserts in the region of the Pilbara, and on the east by the Northern Territory.

The region was named in 1879 by government surveyor Alexander Forrest after Secretary of State for the Colonies John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley.

==History==
The Kimberley was one of the earliest settled parts of Australia, with the first humans landing about 65,000 years ago. They created a complex culture that developed over thousands of years. Yam (&quot;Dioscorea hastifolia&quot;) agriculture was developed, and rock art suggests that this was where some of the earliest boomerangs were invented. The worship of Wandjina deities was most common in this region, and a complex theology dealing with the transmigration of souls was part of the local people&#x27;s religious philosophy.

During the 18th century, Dutch explorers named the region of Kimberley and nearby Darwin variations of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land after the VOC governor-general Anthony van Diemen. This should not be confused with the more general and prolonged use of the same name for Tasmania.

In 1837, with expedition support from the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain, Lieutenants George Grey and Franklin Lushington and 12 men sailed on the schooner &quot;Lynher&quot; from Cape Town, South Africa. They reached Hanover Bay on 2 December 1837. The exploring party started inland on 19 January 1838. Leaders and men were totally inexperienced, their progress was delayed by flooded country, and they abandoned many stores along the way. The party was constantly split up although they had to contend with large numbers of hostile Aboriginals. On 11 February, Grey was speared and became critically ill but, after two weeks, continued the exploration. The party found and named the Gairdner River, the Glenelg River, the Stephen and Whately ranges and Mount Lyell before returning to Hanover Bay in April. There they were picked up by and &quot;Lynher&quot; and taken to Mauritius to recuperate.

In 1879, Western Australian government surveyor Alexander Forrest led a party of seven from the west coast at Beagle Bay to Katherine, Northern Territory. Forrest explored and named the Kimberley district, the Margaret and Ord rivers and the King Leopold Ranges (now the Wunaamin-Miliwundi Ranges), and located well watered pastoral lands along the Fitzroy and Ord rivers. He subsequently set himself up as a land agent specialising in the Kimberley during a period to 1883 when over of land were taken up as pastoral leaseholds in the region.

In 1881, Philip Saunders and Adam Johns, in the face of great difficulties and dangers, found gold in various parts of the Kimberley. Early in 1881, the first five graziers, who called themselves the Murray Squatting Company, took up behind Beagle Bay and named it Yeeda Station. In 1883 they were the first men to shear sheep in the southern Kimberley. Additional Anglo-European settlement occurred in 1885, when ranchers drove cattle across Australia from the eastern states in search of good pasture lands. After gold was discovered around Halls Creek, many other erstwhile European miners arrived rapidly.

In the 1890s, the area was the site of an armed insurrection of indigenous people led by Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior.

During World War II, when Australia was among the nations at war with the Axis powers, the Japanese invaded the nation with only a small reconnaissance party in The Kimberley on 19 January 1944; they were investigating reports that the Allies were building large bases in the region. Four Japanese officers were on board a small fishing boat. They investigated the York Sound region for a day and a night before returning to Kupang in Timor on 20 January. After returning to Japan in February, the junior officer, who had commanded the party, suggested using 200 Japanese prison inmates to launch a guerrilla campaign in Australia. No superior adopted his suggestion, and the officer was posted to other duties.

==Demographics==
The 2011 estimated permanent population of The Kimberley was 34,794 but it rises dramatically during winter when it attracts a seasonal population. On Census night in 2011 (9 August), it was 50,113. The population is fairly evenly distributed, with only three towns having populations in excess of 2,000: Broome (12,766), Derby (3,261), and Kununurra (4,573). Approximately 40% of the region&#x27;s population is of Aboriginal descent.

===Urban centres and localities===
==Indigenous languages==
The Kimberley has been noted as a region of great linguistic diversity, rivalled in Australia only by the Top End. Depending on the geographical boundaries of The Kimberley, and the definition of what constitutes a &quot;language&quot; (as opposed to a &quot;dialect&quot;), about 50-60 Aboriginal languages were once spoken in this region. The vast majority of these do not belong to the family of Pama-Nyungan languages. Four endemic, primary language families are recognised within the core Kimberley region:

* Nyulnyulan languages, including languages spoken on the Dampier Peninsula and along the Fitzroy River
* Bunuban languages, including languages spoken in the Fitzroy River Basin
* Worrorran languages, including languages spoken in the northern Kimberley, north of King Sound, up to Wyndham
* Jarrakan languages, including languages spoken along the Ord River, from Halls Creek up to Wyndham and Kununurra.

Pama-Nyungan languages spoken in and around the Kimberley region include the Marrngu languages (such as Karajarri and Nyangumarta, the Ngumpin languages (such as Walmajarri and Jaru), the Yapa languages (such as Warlpiri) and the Western Desert languages (including Wangkajunga and Kukatja). Non-Pama-Nyungan languages spoken around the Kimberleys (but speakers of which today live within the Kimberley) include the Daly language Murrinh-Patha and Western Mirndi language Jaminjung.

Presently, many indigenous languages are no longer spoken on a daily basis. In addition to Australian English, post-contact languages spoken in the Kimberley include Aboriginal English, Kriol, Pidgin English and the Malay-based Broome Pearling Lugger Pidgin (not spoken on a daily basis any more).

==Politics==
At the federal level, the Kimberley is represented by the member for Durack. At state level, the Kimberley electorate takes in all of the region and its towns.

The Kimberley region consists of the local government areas of Broome, Derby-West Kimberley, Halls Creek and Wyndham-East Kimberley.

== Art ==
The Kimberley region is extremely rich in art, mainly that of Indigenous rock art. Considering the area&#x27;s size, it is no surprise that there are tens of thousands of rock art examples coming from a variety of different cultural groups within the region. The diversity of peoples has allowed for many different art styles to develop with some of the most widely known examples being Wandjina and Gwion Gwion. In addition to the variation in styles, there are almost equally diverse fabrication techniques. The earliest form of Kimberley rock art was hand stencils, but techniques such as engraving, painting, scratchwork, pecking, drawing, and later beeswax applique have also been used. In addition to the varying styles and techniques, there are united visual depictions that reflect the changes and persistence within the cultural and natural environment.
The changing and expanding complexity of styles and techniques has caught the attention of many, paving the way for mass amounts of archaeological and anthropological research. Much of the artwork in the area has been gone over with similar or alternative methods to preserve the art, add to it, or enhance it. Rock shelters are some of the best locations for preservation. The oldest category known as the Irregular Infill Animal or the Naturalistic period is responsible for the region&#x27;s life-size animal depictions. A rock shelter in Kimberley&#x27;s northeastern territory is home to a perfect example of this, a two-meter-long kangaroo painting on the ceiling. This case was extremely rare as archaeologist found remains of mud wasp nests that could be used for dating. These nests were located both below and on top of the painting making them prime for determining an accurate age of the kangaroo art itself. They analysed samples from 6 of the nests and settled on a date between 17,500 years old and 17,100 years old, making the kangaroo rock art the oldest in Australia.

Based on oral accounts from Aboriginal people in the region it has been confirmed that many of the works that have been re-touched maintain a much deeper significance. There is a complex performative aspect that goes hand-in-hand with the art that remains today. The re-touching/re-marking actions are considered a performance and act as a retelling of the story behind the art. The performance is a way for people to reconnect with the cultural significance behind the work itself and maintain the connection of person to place. This process highlights indigenous beliefs about the land and the position that native people have within that space. Identity plays a major role in understanding the rock art in the region. There are many different sectors within the Kimberley region that allow for a dispersal of cultural thought and expression unique to the group in their respected areas. This differentiation of style may have been socially necessary, but there was a unifying aspect in regard to the Wandjinas and the meaning behind them. They are seen throughout the region at many different sites and are the most repainted rock art in Kimberley. This is due to the fact that indigenous groups believe in the power that Wandjina holds. Creation stories, migrational patterns, and clothing style of the figures emphasise their importance and integration into the sociocultural groups inhabiting the area.

==Geography==
The Kimberley is an area of , which is about three times the size of England, twice the size of Victoria, or just slightly smaller than California.

The Kimberley consists of the ancient, steep-sided mountain ranges of northwestern Australia cut through with sandstone and limestone gorges and steep ridges, from which the extreme monsoonal climate has removed much of the soil. The southern end of the Kimberley beyond the Dampier Peninsula is flatter with dry tropical grassland and is used for cattle ranching. In parts of the Kimberley, such as the valleys of the Ord and Fitzroy Rivers in the south, the soils are relatively usable cracking clays, whilst elsewhere they are lateritic Orthents. Although none of the mountains reach even , there is so much steep land as to make much of the region difficult to traverse, especially during the wet season, when even sealed roads are often flooded. The coast is typically steep cliffs in the north but flatter in the south, all subject to high tides.

===Climate===
The Kimberley has a tropical monsoon climate. The region receives about 90% of its rainfall during the short wet season, from November to April, when cyclones are common (especially around Broome) and the rivers flood. The annual rainfall is highest in the northwest, where Kalumburu and the Mitchell Plateau average per year, and lowest in the southeast where it is around . In the dry season, from May to October, south easterly breezes bring sunny days and cool nights. Climate change since 1967 has led to large increases of as much as per year in annual rainfall over the whole region. A 2007 study suggests Asian pollution may be a key contributory factor to this increased rainfall. In 1997 and 2000, the region received especially heavy rains, leading to record flooding of the Fitzroy and other rivers.

The Kimberley is one of the hottest parts of Australia, with the average annual mean temperature around , and with mean maximum temperatures almost always above , even in July. The hottest part of the year is November before the rains break, when temperatures frequently reach above on the coast and well over inland. Mean minimum temperatures in July range from around in the south to along the coast, whilst in November and December they are generally around . Record high temperatures range from around , while record lows are around , although some parts of the central Kimberly plateau can drop below during the dry season.

The Aboriginal people of the Kimberley recognise six traditional seasons based on meteorological events, as well as on observations of flora and fauna.

===Geology===
During the Devonian period, a barrier reef system formed before a subsequent drop in sea levels over the Kimberley. This reef system was similar to the Great Barrier Reef and is still visible today in the form of the Napier Range and the Ningbing Range. Some of the features are Tunnel Creek, Windjana Gorge and Geikie Gorge.

This area is also known as the Kimberley Block physiographic province, of which it is part of the larger West Australian Shield division. This province contains the Wunaamin-Miliwundi Range, Durack Range, Leveque Rise, Browse Depression, and Londonderry Rise physiographic sections.

===Coastline===
In Bureau of Meteorology weather reports the &quot;North Kimberley Coast&quot; is the WA border to Kuri Bay section of the coast, while the &quot;West Kimberley Coast&quot; is from Kuri Bay to Wallal Downs. Significant sections of the coastline between Broome and Wyndham have no means of road access, and boat or helicopter are the only means. Due to the isolation, a number of tourist operations on the coastline have been called &quot;wilderness&quot; locations.

==Ecology==
The rugged and varied sandstone landscape is home to a distinctive mixture of wildlife, which has been thoroughly mapped and described by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management. There are habitats similar to the Kimberley across the border in the Northern Territory, including the valleys of the Victoria and Daly Rivers but these have been less carefully studied.

===Flora===

Much of the Kimberley is chiefly covered in open savanna woodland dominated by low bloodwood and boab trees (&quot;Adansonia gregorii&quot;) with Darwin stringybark and Darwin woollybutt eucalyptus in the wetter areas. The red sandy soil of the Dampier Peninsula in the south is known for its characteristic pindan wooded grassland, while in the more fertile areas like the Ord Valley, the trees are found in grasslands of &quot;Chrysopogon&quot;, &quot;Aristida&quot;, &quot;Dichanthium&quot; and &quot;Xerochloa&quot; (rice grass) in the wetter valleys. The banks of the Ord, Fitzroy River and other rivers are home to a greater variety of vegetation, while in sheltered gorges of the high rainfall north there are patches of tropical dry broadleaf forest, called monsoon forests, deciduous vine forest or vine thicket in Australia, (often mistakenly which is called &quot;dry rainforest&quot;), which were unknown to science until 1965, and are one of the most floristically rich parts of Australia outside the Wet Tropics and southwestern WA. There are also areas of mangrove in river estuaries where the coast is flatter.

===Flora regions===
In 1979, Beard identified four phytogeographic districts within the Northern Botanical Province:
* Gardner District (Ga) in the north (and further divided into the West Gardner (WGa), Central Gardner (CGa) and East Gardner (EGa))
* Fitzgerald District (Fi) in the centre
* Dampier (Da) and Hall (Ha) Districts in the south

===Fauna===
Animals found here include the huge saltwater crocodile, it&#x27;s smaller cousin the freshwater crocodile and a rich variety of birds such as the channel-billed cuckoo, Pacific koel, purple-crowned fairywren and the bowerbird. The sandstone gorges of north Kimberley are an important refuge for a particularly rich collection of endemic species including some that have disappeared from the flatter areas, including the purple-crowned fairywren, the endangered Gouldian finch and a large number of amphibians: flat-headed frog, cave-dwelling frog, magnificent tree frog, Derby toadlet, small toadlet, fat toadlet, the unconfirmed marbled toadlet, Mjoberg&#x27;s toadlet, mole toadlet and stonemason&#x27;s toadlet. Mammals that have declined especially in the flatlands include the bilby, northern quoll, pale field rat, golden-backed tree-rat, and golden bandicoot. Megabats such as the black flying foxes and little red flying foxes are common and perform important pollination and seed dispersal work for many species of native trees and shrubs.

A species of endemic gecko, &quot;Gehyra kimberleyi&quot;, is named after the Kimberley region.

The gorges of central Kimberley are known for their fossils and for their large colonies of bats, including Windjana, Tunnel Creek, and Geikie Gorges. Lake Argyle and other wetlands of the Ord and the Kimberley are important habitats while there are important populations of shorebirds in the Ord estuary, Eighty-mile Beach and Roebuck Bay, which has been described as &quot;one of the most important stop-over areas for shorebirds in Australia and globally&quot;. Finally there are a number of rocky islands off the north coast that are home to seabirds and turtles.

===Threats and preservation===

Little of the Kimberley has been subject to wholesale clearance other than particularly fertile parts of the Ord Valley (and areas of Kimberley-type habitat across in the Daly River basin in the Northern Territory) but the pastureland in the southern areas has been affected by 100 years of livestock grazing and other threats including introduced weeds (such as cocklebur, parkinsonia, bellyache bush and castor oil plant), feral cats and changes to traditional Aboriginal fire regimes (the way grassland is burnt and allowed to renew). However, the remote sandstone areas to the north have valuable original habitats in good condition providing shelter for much wildlife.

The largest protected areas are the Prince Regent National Park and the Drysdale River National Park along with Gregory National Park and Keep River National Park across in the Northern Territory, which preserves similar habitats. (Keep River&#x27;s nearest town is Kununurra in the Kimberley.)

The Kimberley is a popular tourist destination, with areas such as the Bungle Bungle Range, the Gibb River Road, Lake Argyle, El Questro Station, Mornington Sanctuary, Horizontal Falls and Cape Leveque. The Gibb River Road and the road into the Bungle Bungles can at times be accessed in a two-wheel drive car, although one can access many additional areas in a four-wheel drive vehicle.

Other parks in the region include Geikie Gorge National Park, Mirima National Park, Mitchell River National Park, Point Coulomb National Park, Purnululu National Park, Tunnel Creek National Park, Windjana Gorge National Park and Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater National Park. In 2012 the Western Australian government announced the creation of the 7,062 square kilometre Camden Sound Marine Park with a further three to come.

Visitors to the area should be aware that the area can be subject to controlled burns at any time of year. In September 2011, a fire burned five people, two severely, who had been competing in the Kimberley Ultramarathon, an endurance cross country footrace.

===Save the Kimberley campaign===

The Wilderness Society has led a campaign to protest a proposal to industrialise the James Price Point area of Broome. Woodside Energy, with the additional involvement of BHP and the Government of Australia, has sought to build a gas industrial complex, and those in opposition believe that such a development threatens the region. The campaign has received support from public figures such as John Butler, Clare Bowditch, Missy Higgins and former leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown.

On 5 October 2012, a concert was held at Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia, to raise awareness of the campaign; the protest event attracted approximately 6,000 people.

On 24 February 2013, an estimated 20,000 people gathered for a charity concert in Fremantle, Western Australia to raise awareness and funds to help protect the Kimberley, with performances from Ball Park Music, Missy Higgins, and John Butler.

==Economy==

The Kimberley region has a diverse regional economy. Mining, construction, tourism, retail, agriculture, and pearling are major contributors to the region&#x27;s economic output.

The town of Broome has a flourishing pearling industry, which operates around the Kimberley coast. Some of the major farmers are Paspaley Pearls, Clipper Pearls, Broome Pearls and the Willie Creek Pearl Farm.

One third of the world&#x27;s annual production of diamonds is mined at the Argyle and the Ellendale diamond mines. Oil is extracted from the Blina oil field and natural gas is extracted from the Ichthys LNG project. Zinc and lead were mined at the Pillara and Cadjebut mines near Fitzroy Crossing, with nickel still being mined at Sallay Mallay near Halls Creek. Derby is the nearest export base for shipping these metals.

Traditionally, the economy depended on pastoral leases, with most of the region covered by the leases.

More recently agriculture has been focused on the Ord River Irrigation Area near Kununurra. Irrigation was also trialled in the West Kimberley by way of the now defunct Camballin Irrigation Scheme. There are also fruit growers in Broome and in other areas in the West Kimberley. Beef cattle are grown in the Kimberley and exported live. Wyndham features the last remaining meatworks in the Kimberley - there were formerly works at Broome and Derby but financial constraints have caused these to be closed.

Barramundi are bred in Lake Argyle, and Broome features a fully equipped Aquaculture Park near the port; tenants include Paspaley Pearls and Broome TAFE. The Kimberley also has a thriving fishing industry.

Some of Australia&#x27;s most prominent indigenous artists and art centres are in or adjacent to the Kimberley region. Artists such as Paddy Bedford and Freddie Timms have an international profile, and there are a number of Aboriginal-owned and controlled art centres and companies that assist artists, arrange exhibitions and sell works. The art centres in the region are also organized through the Association of Northern, Kimberley and Arnhem Aboriginal Artists. Issues have been raised regarding the exploitation of indigenous artists by businesses and individuals, including in the Kimberley, which were canvassed in an Australian Senate parliamentary committee report.

Tourism is expected to remain one of the Kimberley region&#x27;s major growth industries. Averaged across 2010, 2011, and 2012, there were 292,600 domestic and international visitors to the Kimberley annually.

<text>The Spearman–Brown prediction formula, also known as the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula, is a formula relating psychometric reliability to test length and used by psychometricians to predict the reliability of a test after changing the test length. The method was published independently by Spearman (1910) and Brown (1910).

==Calculation==

Predicted reliability, formula_1, is estimated as:

:formula_2

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of &quot;tests&quot; combined (see below) and formula_3 is the reliability of the current &quot;test&quot;. The formula predicts the reliability of a new test composed by replicating the current test &quot;n&quot; times (or, equivalently, creating a test with &quot;n&quot; parallel forms of the current exam). Thus &quot;n&quot; = 2 implies doubling the exam length by adding items with the same properties as those in the current exam. Values of &quot;n&quot; less than one may be used to predict the effect of shortening a test.

== Forecasting test length ==

The formula can also be rearranged to predict the number of replications required to achieve a degree of reliability:

:formula_4

,where formula_5 is the Pearson correlation between the split-halves. Although the Spearman-Brown formula is rarely used as a split-half reliability coefficient after the development of tau-equivalent reliability, this method is still useful for two-item scales.

===Its relation to other split-half reliability coefficients===
====Split-half parallel reliability====
Cho (2016) suggests using systematic nomenclature and formula expressions, criticizing that reliability coefficients have been represented in a disorganized and inconsistent manner with historically inaccurate and uninformative names. The assumption of the Spearman-Brown formula is that split-halves are parallel, which means that the variances of the split-halves are equal. The systematic name proposed for the Spearman-Brown formula is split-half parallel reliability. In addition, the following equivalent systematic formula has been proposed.

formula_6

==== Split-half tau-equivalent reliability ====
Split-half tau-equivalent reliability is a reliability coefficient that can be used when the variances of split-halves are not equal. Flanagan-Rulon (formula_7, formula_8), Guttman (formula_9) suggested the following formula expressions:
formula_10, 
formula_11, and
formula_12.

Where formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, and formula_16 is the variance of the first split-half, the second half, the sum of the two split-halves, and the difference of the two split-halves, respectively.

These formulas are all algebraically equivalent. The systematic formula is as follows.

formula_17.

==== Split-half congeneric reliability ====
Split-half parallel reliability and split-half tau-equivalent reliability have the assumption that split-halves have the same length. Split-half congeneric reliability mitigates this assumption. However, because there are more parameters that need to be estimated than the given pieces of information, another assumption is needed. Raju (1970) examined the split-half congeneric reliability coefficient when the relative length of each split-half was known. Angoff (1953) and Feldt (1975) published the split-half congeneric reliability assuming that the length of each split-half was proportional to the sum of the variances and covariances.

== History ==
The name Spearman-Brown seems to imply a partnership, but the two authors were competitive. This formula originates from two papers published simultaneously by Brown (1910) and Spearman (1910) in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot;. Charles Spearman had a hostile relationship with Karl Pearson who worked together in King&#x27;s College London, and they exchanged papers that criticized and ridiculed each other. William Brown received his Ph.D. under Pearson&#x27;s guidance. An important part of Brown&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was devoted to criticizing Spearman&#x27;s work on the rank correlation. Spearman appears first in this formula before Brown because he is a more prestigious scholar than Brown. For example, Spearman established the first theory of reliability and is called &quot;the father of classical reliability theory.&quot; This is an example of Matthew Effect or Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy.

This formula should be referred to as the Brown-Spearman formula for the following reasons: First, the formula we use today is not Spearman&#x27;s (1910) version, but Brown&#x27;s (1910). Brown (1910) explicitly presented this formula as a split-half reliability coefficient, but Spearman (1910) did not. Second, the formal derivation of Brown (1910) is more concise and elegant than that of Spearman (1910). Third, it is likely that Brown (1910) was written before Spearman (1910). Brown (1910) is based on his doctoral dissertation, which was already available at the time of publication. Spearman (1910) criticized Brown (1910), but Brown (1910) criticized only Spearman (1904). Fourth, it is the APA style to list the authors in alphabetical order.

==Use and related topics==

This formula is commonly used by psychometricians to predict the 
reliability of a test after changing the test length. This relationship is 
particularly vital to the split-half and related methods of estimating 
reliability (where this method is sometimes known as the &quot;Step Up&quot; formula).

The formula is also helpful in understanding the nonlinear relationship 
between test reliability and test length. Test length must grow by increasingly larger values as the desired reliability approaches 1.0.

If the longer/shorter test is not parallel to the current test, then the prediction will not be strictly accurate. For example, if a highly reliable test was lengthened by adding many poor items then the achieved reliability will probably be much lower than that predicted by this formula.

For the reliability of a two-item test, the formula is more appropriate than Cronbach&#x27;s alpha (used in this way, the Spearman-Brown formula is also called &quot;standardized Cronbach&#x27;s alpha&quot;, as it is the same as Cronbach&#x27;s alpha computed using the average item intercorrelation and unit-item variance, rather than the average item covariance and average item variance).

<doc id="409812" wikidata="Q429186" url="?curid=409812" title="B.U.G. Mafia">
<text>B.U.G. Mafia (an abbreviation for &quot;Bucharest Underground Mafia&quot;), is a Romanian hip hop group from Pantelimon, Bucharest, widely regarded as one of the seminal acts of gangsta rap in Romania. Founded in 1993 as Black Underground, its original lineup consisted of Vlad &quot;Tataee&quot; Irimia, Dragoș &quot;Caddy&quot; (short for Cadillac) Vlad-Neagu and two other members, D.D. and Mr.Nobody, who, by the end of the year, had already departed from the group. Irimia and Vlad-Neagu, who were still teenage high school students at the time, had been working on amateur solo recordings and had little professional prospects on their own prior to their encounter. The group initially performed as a duo throughout Bucharest at local highschool proms and parties while considering their options for professional careers in music and, following a string of relatively unsuccessful attempts at promoting their music in English, they recruited Alin &quot;Uzzi&quot; Demeter in 1995 and eventually transitioned to writing in Romanian.

Throughout the years, the group endured a long-standing controversy due to the explicit and confrontational nature of their lyrics. Focusing on subjects such as the post-communist Romanian political class, poverty and crime in Romania&#x27;s communist-built housing projects or their recurring hostility towards Romanian Police, they were subsequently banned from many mainstream T.V. and radio stations in Romania and even at times prevented from touring, spending a night in police custody after their first concert in Drobeta-Turnu Severin in 1997. Although controversial in their incipient years, their lyricism has been praised by a number of literary figures, such as Emil Brumaru and Mircea Cărtărescu.

Despite being independently produced on a modest budget over just a few months in 1995, their debut album &quot;Mafia&quot; signified the birth of Romanian gangsta rap and established them on the fledgling hip hop scene emerging at the time in Romania. They have been estimated to have sold over 1,150,000 records.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1992–1995) ===

The group was founded in late 1993 when Pantelimon-based producer Vlad &quot;Tataee&quot; Irimia met Dragoș &quot;Caddy&quot; Vlad-Neagu in Bucharest. Tataee, who was still in highschool, had been interested in becoming a professional musician since 1992, when, under the stage name Doom, he had produced an independent demo called &quot;Straight Outta da Hell&quot;, stirring Caddillac&#x27;s interest, as he was also an amateur recording artist working under the name MC La Duc and had recorded a track titled &quot;Apocalipse&quot; on his own earlier in 1993. As Romania had just overthrown its communist regime in the Romanian Revolution of 1989, western goods such as bootleg recordings of rap albums had started to flood the market in the market liberalization process that had begun. As Irimia and Vlad-Neagu learned that their musical tastes coincided, they decided on pursuing their careers as a group which they named Black Underground and abbreviated it to B.U.G. in late 1993. Two friends of Irimia and Vlad-Neagu, D.D. and Mr.Nobody also joined later but, due to a lack of interest and involvement, quit in early 1994, before the group recorded any songs. In March 1994, Irimia and Vlad-Neagu, working under the stage names Doom and Klax 187 respectively, reworked Irimia&#x27;s demo recording into their debut single. Working at the Uniplus Radio studios in Bucharest, the two decided to keep the title &quot;Straight Outta da Hell&quot; and recorded the song with Florin &quot;DJ Sensei&quot; Cojocaru, an electronic musician and DJ who produced the record. &quot;Straight Outta da Hell&quot; premiered a month later on Uniplus Radio during &quot;YO! Rap is Moving.&quot; a hip-hop oriented late night program hosted by Adrian Niculescu, a local radio personality and DJ. Shortly following their radio debut, Tataee and Caddillac managed to book their first live appearance during a local hip hop concert in Bucharest, an experience they would both later remember as unpleasant, but also significantly influential in their choice of pursuing careers as professional musicians.

Since hip hop was just emerging as a music genre in Romania in the early 1990s, studio time and stage performance opportunities were relatively limited, so the group had to rely on the restricted prospects that presented themselves to record more songs. They began working with Romeo Vanica, a keyboardist who had been a member of the Romanian rock group Mondial, who agreed to allow them to use his studio equipment for music production in 1994 as they started creating more songs for an English debut album, tentatively titled &quot;Breakin&#x27; da Law&quot;.
 While involved in the production process, Irimia and Vlad-Neagu also became interested in music management and consequently started exploring the local rap scene for other groups or solo artists to associate with in order to include a more diverse variety of artists on the album. In December 1994, they met Alin Demeter, who at the time performed under the stage name Drama and was a member of &quot;Demonii&quot; (The Demons), one of the few local rap acts who performed in Romanian. Initially, B.U.G. invited both members of the group to enroll in the newly founded crew and, throughout the first half of 1995, Demonii became involved in a number of local live performances with Black Underground in Bucharest. Following Demeter&#x27;s bandmate&#x27;s decision to form another group besides Demonii, the two parted ways and Demeter joined Black Underground in May 1995. After the settlement, Irimia, Vlad-Neagu and Demeter decided to scrap the recordings they had worked on and switch to performing and writing in Romanian in order to gain access to a larger potential fanbase in their native Romania.

=== &quot;Mafia&quot; (1995–1996) ===
The group released &quot;Mafia&quot; in late 1995 and, since music distribution was virtually nonexistent in Romania at the time, the album was only available for a relatively short period of time in Bucharest, becoming valuable fan memorabilia over time. The album, recorded by Holograf keyboardist and producer Antonio &quot;Tino&quot; Furtună, contained 15 tracks, including collaborations with Pantelimon-based group M&amp;G, hip hop female artist Marijuana and Romanian actress Rona Hartner. Even though their lyrical abilities have refined over the time, the group reflected the rising anger of the urban youth detailing aspects such as urban violence or the rising poverty of the Romanian working class in post-communist Romania in their debut work. With songs such as &quot;Viață De Borfaș&quot; (Thug Life), &quot;Ucigaș&quot; (Killer) or &quot;Înc-o Cruce-n Cimitir&quot; (Another Cross In The Cemetery) they painted their worldview as inner-city youths.

Despite the album&#x27;s poor sound quality and virtually inexistent label promotion, it created enough controversy around the group to allow them get signed by Cat Music, one of the largest Romanian record labels, paving their way to national superstardom. &quot;Mafia&quot; is frequently quoted among Romanian hip hop historians as the third hip hop album to be released in Romania, after R.A.C.L.A.&#x27;s &quot;Rap-Sodia efectului defectului&quot; (Rap-sody For The Flaw&#x27;s Effect) and Paraziții&#x27;s &quot;Poezii pentru pereți&quot; (Poetry For The Walls).

===Cat Music and national exposure (1996–1997)===
After releasing their debut album, controversy surrounded the group regarding recurring use of violent and sexual lyrics and profanity. The situation created a buzz around them that sparked the interest of Alin Brașov, a Romanian American lawyer who had just returned to Romania and was one of the four associates who owned Cat Music, one of the first professional record labels, which also was the local branch of Sony Records. Brașov, having heard about the impressive success N.W.A had in the United States, convinced the other three associates, Emanuel Maxwell, Sorin Golea and Dan Popi to give the group a chance. B.U.G. Mafia were subsequently signed by Cat Music and released their second studio material, the &quot;Înc-o zi, înc-o poveste&quot; (Another Day, Another Story) EP. It sparked the group&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Pantelimonu&#x27; Petrece&quot; (Pantelimon&#x27;s Having A Party), a feature with young pop singer Iuliana &quot;July&quot; Petrache. Tataee referenced this moment in a 2009 interview with Radio ZU talk show-host Mihai Morar, mentioning that the song became a hit just after Romania adopted a new copyright law, enabling the group to make significant profits, as B.U.G. Mafia were one of the few Romanian groups that received radio airplay in the mid 90s. He also mentioned on his official Twitter page that Mircea Badea was the first TV host to have the group on the air in 1996, during the morning show he presented at Tele 7 abc with Teo Trandafir. &quot;Pantelimonu&#x27; Petrece&quot; was so successful that the group was actually in talks with the TV station to produce a music video for the song, but the idea eventually fell through.

One hit single wasn&#x27;t enough for B.U.G. Mafia and they released their third studio material and second full-length album the same year. &quot;Născut și crescut în Pantelimon&quot; (Born And Raised In Pantelimon), an homage to the neighbourhood where Tataee, Uzzi and Caddillac grew up, sparked hit singles &quot;Până când moartea ne va despărți&quot; (Until Death Do Us Part), which is also Puya&#x27;s studio debut and &quot;Născut și crescut în Pantelimon&quot; (Born And Raised In Pantelimon). The album included notable guests such as Don Baxter and DJ Freakadadisk, members of Romanian group Morometzii at the time, who would go on to become two of the most notable figures in Romanian hip hop.

===Controversy and superstardom years (1997–2000)===

====Arrest and &quot;IV: Deasupra tuturor&quot;====

As Cat Music had grown into a fully professional record label, the group started to get noticed by the Romanian media. In early 1997, Tataee, Caddilac and Uzzi, together with La Familia members Tudor Sișu and Dragoș &quot;Puya&quot; Gardescu, were taken into police custody after a concert in Turnu Severin. As Romania was still a fairly conservative country in the mid-90s, the Romanian penal code forbad the use of profanity in public places. Refusing to take into account that the violent lyrics were not actually performed in a public place, the Romanian Police forces arrested the five artists, charging them with outrage against good customs. They were eventually released after 10 hours of giving statements at the police station and district attorney&#x27;s office in Turnu Severin. The Romanian media brought the case to national fame and, much like the FBI drawing publicity to N.W.A in the early 90s, the case was the starting point of a media frenzy that would last for over two years and bring a lot of unexpected fame for both B.U.G. Mafia and La Familia.

Over the summer, the group continued studio work on its fourth album, &quot;&quot; (IV:Above Everybody). Group producer Tataee had just started collaborating with Eddy &quot;DJ Phantom&quot; Schneider, one of the most known Romanian composers in the 1990s, who helped refine the g-funk sound the group was trying to achieve at the time. The legal incident that had occurred in February reflected in the album&#x27;s sales, as it moved an impressive 55,000 units with no music video or radio single promoting it. It was the first B.U.G. Mafia album to be released on both cassette tape and CD.

====&quot;De cartier&quot; and national fame====
The group released the first single from its fifth studio album, &quot;Pentru &#x27;98&quot; (For &#x27;98) in June 1998. Although commercial sounding and easygoing, the track was met with reluctance by both radio stations and fans alike. A music video was shot by the then newly formed Atomic TV music channel, but the result was disappointing for the group&#x27;s members and management and thus the video was never released. An unexpected success came from the single&#x27;s b-side, a song entitled &quot;N-ai fost acolo&quot; (You weren&#x27;t there), a viral response to critics claiming that the group&#x27;s lyrics were pure fiction and had no factual basis whatsoever, became a massive hit during the summer and provided a strong launch pad for the album&#x27;s release in September 1998. &quot;De Cartier&quot; (From The Hood) was B.U.G. Mafia&#x27;s best selling album, moving over 125,000 copies and catapulting the group to national superstardom. The album&#x27;s success attracted pop icon Loredana Groza&#x27;s interest for a collaboration. The resulting song, &quot;Lumea e a mea&quot; (The world is mine) was released as a single in late 1998 and became an instant hit in Romania. The success prompted the making of a music video, which was the first Romanian hip hop video ever made.

B.U.G. Mafia continued to work throughout 1999 and, after the impressive success one of their concerts in Bucharest had, they were invited by TV host Mihai Tatulici to talk about their work and history in a special edition of his talk show. The exposure they got reflected in the sales of their sixth studio effort, &quot;După blocuri&quot;, which was released in early 2000 by Cat Music. Accompanied by the group&#x27;s first official music video, the album is often categorized as their darkest work to this day. Influenced by the massive discreditation campaign started by the Romanian media after the success of 1998&#x27;s &quot;De cartier&quot;, the album was very liberal and experimental with production and songwriting techniques for its time in Romanian music. The group&#x27;s notoriety also prompted some inmates incarcerated at the Rahova State Penitentiary in Bucharest to request a B.U.G. Mafia concert. The live performance took place in mid-2000 and is frequently mentioned by Tataee, Caddilac and Uzzi as a very special and meaningful moment in the group&#x27;s history.

&quot;Întotdeauna pentru totdeauna&quot; (Always Forever) was released in late 2000, making it their second album in the same year. Supported by the &quot;Un 2 şi trei de 0&quot; (A two followed by three zeroes) single, it brought singer-songwriter Vilmos &quot;Villy&quot; Kanalas to national fame, making him one of the most well known B.U.G. Mafia collaborators over time. The album was also known in Romania for its inclusion of the &quot;Poezie de stradă&quot; (Street Poetry) song which was released as a single in 2001 and had a music video that featured real Romanian Police officers crashing an organized crime meeting.

===Casa Productions===
The group had been interested in founding a record label since the late 1990s so they could obtain more creative control in producing their own music and also sign and develop new artists. The paperwork was finalized in 2001 and the newly formed Casa Productions entered the Romanian music market a year later, when the group released the &quot;B.U.G. Mafia prezinta CASA&quot; (B.U.G. Mafia presents: Casa) compilation album to introduce the label&#x27;s new artists to the world. Hip hop heavyweights M&amp;G and XXL &amp; 10 Grei as well as newcomers Mahsat, Anturaj and Luchian were amongst the label&#x27;s new signees in 2002. Gangsta rap pioneers La Familia were also interested in joining Casa Productions but a disagreement with the label&#x27;s management led to a conflict that took both groups to court a couple of years later. The album sold over 100,000 copies and has remained one of the best-selling compilation albums released in Romania. Mahsat were the first act to release their album under Casa Productions in late 2002. A commercial failure, it sold just over 1,000 units and it led to the group&#x27;s disbanding and the release from their contract in 2004. Aside from Casa Productions, each group member founded his own label for personal projects. Rapper Mihai &quot;JerryCo&quot; Dumitrescu released his debut album in 2010 under Tataee&#x27;s label, Legend Audio.

====DJ Swamp (2003–2008)====

Nicolae &quot;DJ Swamp&quot; Oncescu had been a full-time member of hip hop group R.A.C.L.A. for over a year when he decided to join B.U.G. Mafia after a few live appearances with them in 2002. Oncescu quit R.A.C.L.A. shortly after and became a full-time member of B.U.G. Mafia and a staff producer for Casa Productions. Tataee had stated in various interviews that he had been interested in adding a professional DJ to the group since the early 90s but the few hip hop DJs in Romania were already committed to other projects. Petre &quot;Freakadadisk&quot; Urda, who had collaborated with the group on their 1996 album, &quot;Născut și crescut în Pantelimon&quot; (Born and raised in Pantelimon), had been a full-time member of Morometzii before joining Romanian hip hop pioneers Paraziții in 1998 and DJ Dox was also working with R.A.C.L.A. at the time. Oncescu parted ways with the group in 2008 citing creative differences and stated that he remained in good terms with them. However, group producer Tataee repeatedly mentioned that the break up had not been a friendly one and that he had not maintained any connection to DJ Swamp. Oncescu has since changed his professional name to Nicalai and has pursued a career as an electronic music artist, releasing his debut album &quot;A.E.R. - Asta E Romania&quot; (T.I.R. - This Is Romania) in 2009. In a 2011 interview, Oncescu claimed that the reason he parted ways with Mafia was a financial misunderstanding.

====The Goodfellas (2003)====

&quot;Băieții Buni&quot; (The Goodfellas), the eight studio album, was a milestone for several firsts in the group&#x27;s history. It was their first album to be released under the then newly formed Casa Productions label, as well as it was their first album to be recorded at Ines Sound &amp; Video, in Bucharest, at the time Romania&#x27;s most high end recording studio. Group producer Tataee employed several new production techniques and this was reflected in the overall sound of the album, as well as in the way it was received by its fans and critics. With 22 tracks, it was B.U.G. Mafia&#x27;s most lengthy album, also the first in the group&#x27;s history not to have any female guest performers. The follow-up to &quot;Băieții Buni&quot; was only released in 2011 as the group embarked in a 6-year-long journey producing and recording two greatest hits albums in the first decade of the 21st century.

===Greatest Hits Era (2003–2009)===
Starting in late 2003, the group started work on a greatest hits album that was to take them just under 6 years to complete. Tataee wanted the group to re-record the vocals for every song that was to be included on the album, while he produced new beats for the updated versions of the tracks. Titled &quot;Viața Noastră&quot; (Our Life), recording sessions for the album started in 2003 at the Ines Sound and Video studios in Bucharest and carried on throughout 2004 before being halted so the group could work on the &quot;Băieți buni&quot; (Good Guys) soundtrack.

====Our Life Vol.1 (2003–2006)====
The album was released in mid-2006 by Cat Music and Casa Productions after multiple delays. The first single was the title track &quot;Viața Noastră&quot; (Our Life). Using a sample from Casa Productions artist Villy&#x27;s 2002 &quot;O Altă Zi&quot; (Just Another Day) song, it was released in early 2006 along with a music video 
shot by Marius Panduru and directed by Marian Crișan. The album included 14 hit records of the group, all of which had been completely re-recorded and featured an updated sound. As &quot;Pantelimonu&#x27; Petrece&quot; (Pantelimon&#x27;s Having A Party) had been one of their first signature hit-songs, the record was released as a single in mid-2006, with a music video also directed by Marian Crișan. Pop singer Adriana Vlad was hired to record all the female-vocal parts. The album sold over 40,000 copies and was certified gold in Romania.
====&quot;Străzile&quot; and film work (2004–2005)====

In 2004, the group was approached by Pro TV to compose and produce the soundtrack for Andrei Boncea&#x27;s procedural drama, &quot;Băieți buni&quot; (Good Guys). The resulting track, &quot;Străzile&quot; (The Streets) was released as a single in 2005 along with a music video directed by Andreea Păduraru and shot by Tudor Lucaciu. The recording sessions interrupted the group&#x27;s work on their greatest hits album, so its release had to be further delayed until early 2006.

====Our Life Vol.2 (2005–2009)====

Recording sessions for the second part of the group&#x27;s greatest hits album started in 2005, again at the Ines Sound &amp; Video studios in Bucharest. The only song that was released from the 2005 sessions was on the Băieți buni-soundtrack single &quot;Străzile&quot; (The Streets). The album was initially planned to be released in late 2007 but Ines changed their location, upgrading their recording technology, making group producer Tataee to insist for a re-do of the whole album in the new studio. Various other obstacles pushed the release even further into late 2009. &quot;Viața noastră (Vol.2)&quot; (Our Life Vol.2) was B.U.G. Mafia&#x27;s last release on Cat Music, their home label for over 14 years, as the group went independent from 2010.

=== Internet Era (2009–present) ===

A series of notable changes occurred after the release of the second volume of the &quot;Viața Noastră&quot; (Our Life) best-of series. The group left Cat Music, the record company that had catapulted them to superstardom 14 years earlier, which had been their distribution company since they had made the switch to Casa Productions in late 2001. Group producer Tataee mentioned that the group would employ a new approach to music since the Internet had played a crucial role in the demise of the compact disc-era in the musical industry.

<doc id="409817" wikidata="Q2095063" url="?curid=409817" title="The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle">
<text>The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle is a 1939 American biographical musical comedy film directed by H.C. Potter. The film stars Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Edna May Oliver, and Walter Brennan. The film is based on the stories &quot;My Husband&quot; and &quot;My Memories of Vernon Castle&quot;, by Irene Castle. The movie was adapted by Oscar Hammerstein II, Dorothy Yost and Richard Sherman. This was Astaire and Rogers&#x27; ninth and last film together with RKO. Their final pairing was &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949) at MGM.

==Plot==
The film tells of novice American dancer Irene Foote, who convinces New York-based British vaudeville comic Vernon Castle to give up slapstick comedy in favor of sophisticated ballroom dancing.

Their big break comes when they are stranded in Paris, along with their friend, Walter Ashe, with no money. They catch the eye of influential agent Maggie Sutton, who arranges a tryout for them at the prestigious Café de Paris, where they become an overnight sensation. After taking Europe by storm, the Castles return to the United States and become just as big a sensation. Their fame and fortune rises to unprecedented heights in the immediate pre-World War I years.

When World War I starts, Vernon returns to Britain and joins the Royal Flying Corps, while Irene makes patriotic movie serials to aid the war effort. However, Vernon is killed in a training accident, leaving Irene to carry on alone.

==Cast==

* Fred Astaire as Vernon Castle
* Ginger Rogers as Irene Castle (née Foote)
* Edna May Oliver as Maggie Sutton
* Walter Brennan as Walter Ash
* Lew Fields as himself
* Etienne Girardot as Papa Aubel
* Janet Beecher as Mrs. Foote

* Frances Mercer as Claire Ford
* Victor Varconi as Grand Duke
* Donald MacBride as Hotel Manager

==Production==
Irene Castle acted as advisor to this film, and constantly disagreed with the director as to details of costuming and liberties taken. When informed that white actor Walter Brennan was to play the part of faithful servant Walter, she was dumbfounded: the real Walter was black.

The film marks several &quot;firsts&quot;: the characters in it are more realistic than usual in an Astaire-Rogers film, there is none of the usual &quot;screwball comedy&quot; relief provided by such actors as Edward Everett Horton, Victor Moore, or Helen Broderick, it is the only Astaire-Rogers musical biography, the only one on which Oscar Hammerstein II worked, the only one of their musicals with a tragic ending, and the only one in which Astaire&#x27;s character dies.

==Reception==
The film was popular in the US, making $1,120,000 and it also earned $705,000 elsewhere. However, due to high costs RKO accounts recorded the film as losing $50,000.

<doc id="409818" wikidata="Q943193" url="?curid=409818" title="Nassau grouper">
<text>The Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) is one of the large number of perciform fishes in the family Serranidae commonly referred to as groupers. It is the most important of the groupers for commercial fishery in the West Indies, but has been endangered by overfishing.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Nassau grouper as critically endangered, due to commercial and recreational fishing and reef destruction. Fishing the species is prohibited in US federal waters. The Nassau grouper is a US National Marine Fisheries Service listed threatened species by authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

==Description==
The Nassau grouper is a medium to large fish, growing to over a meter in length and up to 25 kg in weight. It has a thick body and large mouth, which it uses to &quot;inhale&quot; prey. Its color varies depending on an individual fish&#x27;s circumstances and environment. In shallow water (down to 60 ft), the grouper is a tawny color, but specimens living in deeper waters are pinkish or red, or sometimes orange-red in color. Superimposed on this base color are a number of lighter stripes, darker spots, bars, and patterns, including black spots below and behind the eye, and a forked stripe on the top of the head.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Nassau grouper lives in the sea near reefs; it is one of the largest fish to be found around coral reefs. It can be found from the shoreline to nearly 100-m-deep water. It lives in the western Atlantic Ocean and around the Caribbean Sea, from Bermuda, Florida, and the Bahamas in the north to the eastern coast of Venezuela, but it is only found in a few places in the Gulf of Mexico, most notably along the coast of Belize.

==Biology==
It is a solitary fish, feeding in the daytime, mainly on other fish and small crustaceans such as crabs and small lobsters. It spawns in December and January, always around the time of the full moon, and always in the same locations. By the light of the full moon, huge numbers of the grouper cluster together to mate in mass spawning.

==Conservation==

The Nassau grouper is fished both commercially and for sport; it is less shy than other groupers, and is readily approached by scuba divers. However, its numbers have been sharply reduced by overfishing in recent years, and it is a slow breeder. Furthermore, its historic spawning areas are easily targeted for fishing, which tends to remove the reproductively active members of the group. The species is therefore highly vulnerable to overexploitation, and is recognised as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The governments of the United States, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas have banned or instituted closed fishing seasons for the Nassau grouper in recent years. In the Cayman Islands, fishing in the spawning holes of the grouper has been banned until the end of 2016. In the case of the Bahamas, the government has instituted a closed fishing season in which fishing for the Nassau grouper is banned from December to February. It is in a very high rate decline and is at serious risk of becoming extinct.

A large spawning site for the species is located at Glover&#x27;s Reef, off the Belizean coast. It has been identified as one of only two viable sites remaining for the species, of 9 originally known locations. In 2002, a permanent marine protected area was established on Glover&#x27;s Reef. However, the Nassau grouper&#x27;s spawning region is not included in this marine protected area (MPA). Instead, their spawning area (located north of the MPA) is subjected to a three-month closure during winter spawning aggregations.

Many conservation methods have been put in place to help the grouper, including closed seasons, when fishing is not allowed. These seasons take place during the spawning season. Regulations allow only fish over 3 lb to be harvested to give the younger fish a chance to spawn. Some areas are protected, and a complete ban on fishing the grouper in US waters has been instituted. Also, protection of the spawning sites at all times is in effect in certain places.

==Status reviews==
The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service recently completed a review of the status of the species for Endangered Species listing. They proposed to list the species as endangered. However, analysis of declines in both populations as well as the size spawning aggregations has led to the species being uplisted to critically endangered by the IUCN Red List in 2018.


The Nassau grouper has been depicted on postage stamps of Cuba (1965, 1975), the Bahamas (1971 5-cent), and Antigua and Barbuda (1987 40-c).

The threats to the grouper include overfishing, fishing during the breeding period, habitat loss, pollution, invasive species, and catching undersized grouper.

The Nassau grouper was placed on the World Conservation Union&#x27;s redlist of threatened species in 1996, and it was determined to be endangered because its population has declined by 60% in the past 30 years. Over a third of spawning aggregations have been estimated to have disappeared, and the grouper is considered to be commercially extinct in some areas.

The current population is estimated to be more than 10,000 mature individuals, but is thought to be decreasing. Their suitable habitat is declining; they need quality coral reef habitats to survive. Their population outlook is not optimistic.

<doc id="409822" wikidata="Q324348" url="?curid=409822" title="Vernon and Irene Castle">
<text>Vernon and Irene Castle were a husband-and-wife team of ballroom dancers and dance teachers who appeared on Broadway and in silent films in the early 20th century. They are credited with reviving the popularity of modern dancing. Castle was a stage name: Vernon (2 May 1887 – 15 February 1918) was born William Vernon Blyth in England. Irene (7 April 1893 – 25 January 1969) was born Irene Foote in the United States.

The couple reached the peak of their popularity in Irving Berlin&#x27;s first Broadway show, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; (1914), in which they refined and popularized the Foxtrot. They also helped to promote ragtime, jazz rhythms and African-American music for dance. Irene became a fashion icon through her appearances on stage and in early movies, and both Castles were in demand as teachers and writers on dance.

After serving with distinction as a pilot in the British Royal Flying Corps during World War I, Vernon died in a plane crash on a flight training base near Fort Worth, Texas, in 1918. Irene continued to perform solo in Broadway, vaudeville and motion picture productions over the next decade. She remarried three times, had children and became an animal-rights activist. In 1939, her life with Vernon was dramatized in &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot;.

==Rise to fame==

Vernon, the son of a pub owner, was born on 2 May 1887 and raised in Norwich, Norfolk. Initially training to become a civil engineer, he moved to New York in 1906 with his sister, Coralie Blythe, and her husband Lawrence Grossmith, both established actors. There he was given a small part on stage by Lew Fields, which led to further acting work, and he became established as a comic actor, singer, dancer and conjuror, under the stage name Vernon Castle. As a dancer in comedic roles, his specialty was playing a gentleman drunk, who elegantly fell about the stage while trying to hide his condition.

Irene was born on 7 April 1893 in New Rochelle, New York, the daughter of a physician. She studied dancing and performed in several amateur theatricals before meeting Vernon Castle at the New Rochelle Rowing Club in 1910. With his help, she was hired for her first professional job, a small dancing part in &quot;The Summer Widowers&quot;.

On 28 May 1911, the two were married in Irene&#x27;s hometown, New Rochelle. After their wedding, Irene joined Vernon in &quot;The Hen-Pecks&quot; (1911), a production in which he was a featured player. The couple then traveled to Paris to perform in a dance revue. The show closed quickly, but the Castles were then hired as a dance act by the Café de Paris in Monaco. They performed the latest American ragtime dances, such as the Turkey Trot and the Grizzly Bear. The two were soon the rage of Parisian society; their success was widely reported in the United States, preparing their way for a triumphant return to New York in 1912.

When they returned to the U.S., their success was repeated on a far wider scale. Making their New York debut in 1912 at a branch of the Cafe de Paris operated by Louis Martin, who had given them their start in Paris, the duo were soon in demand on stage, in vaudeville and in motion pictures. They also became staples of Broadway. Among their shows were &quot;The Sunshine Girl&quot; (1913) and &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; (1914), which boasted Irving Berlin&#x27;s first score, written for the Castles. In this extravaganza, the couple refined and popularized the Foxtrot. After its New York run, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; toured through 1916.

In 1914, the couple opened a dancing school in New York called &quot;Castle House&quot;, a nightclub called &quot;Castles by the Sea&quot; on the Boardwalk in Long Beach, New York, and a restaurant, &quot;Sans Souci&quot;. At Castle House, they taught New York society the latest dance steps by day and greeted guests and performed at their club and cafe at night. They also were in demand for private lessons and appearances at fashionable parties. Despite their fame, they often found themselves treated as hired menials; if a rich client was too demanding, Vernon would quote a fee of a thousand dollars an hour for lessons and often get it.

==Film and fashion==
As America&#x27;s premier dance team, the Castles were trendsetters in a number of arenas. Their enthusiasm for dance encouraged admirers to try new forms of social dance. Considered paragons of respectability and class, the Castles specifically helped remove the stigma of vulgarity from close dancing. The pair&#x27;s image as a harmoniously married couple further promoted the Progressive Era ideals of a wholesome domestic relationship that was achievable through social dance. The Castles&#x27; performances, often set to ragtime and jazz rhythms, also popularized African-American music among well-heeled whites. The Castles appeared in a newsreel called &quot;Social and Theatrical Dancing&quot; in 1914 and wrote a bestselling instructional book, &quot;Modern Dancing&quot;, later that year. The pair also starred in a feature film called &quot;The Whirl of Life&quot; (1915), which was well received by critics and public alike.

As the couple&#x27;s celebrity increased in the mid-1910s, Irene Castle became a major fashion trendsetter, initiating the vogue for shorter, fuller skirts and loose, elasticized corsets. She is also credited with introducing American women in 1913 or 1914 to the bob – the short, boyish hairstyle favored by flappers in the 1920s. The elegant, yet simple, flowing gowns Irene wore on stage and screen were regularly featured in &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and other fashion magazines. These were often supplied by the famous couturier Lucile, but Irene also designed some of her clothes herself. The slender, elegant Castles were pioneers in other ways: they traveled with a black orchestra, James Reese Europe&#x27;s Society Orchestra, and had an openly lesbian manager, Elisabeth Marbury.

The Castles endorsed Victor Records and Victrolas, issuing records by the Castle House Orchestra, led by James Reese Europe, a pioneering figure in African-American music. They also lent their names to advertising for other products, from cigars and cosmetics to shoes and hats.

==World War I: Vernon&#x27;s death==
In 1915, Vernon decided to fight in World War I and began flight school in the U.S., leaving the touring cast of &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;. He received his pilot&#x27;s certificate in early 1916. The Castles gave two farewell performances at the Hippodrome Theatre in New York in January 1916, accompanied by John Philip Sousa and his band. Vernon sailed for England to enlist as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Flying over the Western Front, he completed 300 combat missions, shot down two aircraft and was awarded the in 1917. Posted to Canada to train new pilots at Camp Mohawk in Ontario, he took part in concerts in the evenings. He was promoted to captain, and then transferred with the rest of his unit to the U.S. for winter training at Camp Taliaferro.
Late in 1917, while he was away, Irene appeared in a star-studded revue, &quot;Miss 1917&quot;. Although she was singled out for praise by reviewers, she was unhappy performing on stage alone: &quot;I found myself hopelessly lost as a solo number. I had no training for dancing alone and I should never have tried it.&quot; Though successful with critics, the revue failed to attract an audience; at least not enough of one to pay for the lavish production. Castle&#x27;s specialty song was challenged on copyright grounds, and management cut it. In addition, her act in the show was scheduled for late in the evening, which conflicted with her early morning film work. As the show failed, she and others were let go by the producers. She later sued successfully, but by then the production company was bankrupt. For the rest of 1917, she made well-received appearances on behalf of war charities.

On 15 February 1918, over Benbrook Field, a training field near Fort Worth, Texas, Vernon took emergency action shortly after takeoff to avoid a collision with another aircraft. His plane stalled, and he was unable to recover control before the plane hit the ground. He died soon after the crash, aged 30. Vernon was the only casualty. According to the monument at the crash site, &quot;Neither the other pilot, his student cadet, nor Vernon&#x27;s pet monkey, Jeffrey, were seriously injured.&quot; Irene paid tribute to Vernon in her memoir &quot;My Husband&quot;, 1919. There is a street in Benbrook, Texas, named in his honor, with a monument dedicated to him. Vernon was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York. The grieving memorial figure kneeling on the grave was created by Irene&#x27;s friend, the American sculptor Sally James Farnham.

==Life without Vernon==
On 3 May 1919, Irene married Robert E. Treman, the scion of a prominent Ithaca, New York family. They resided in Ithaca&#x27;s newly cut Cayuga Heights subdivision, north of Cornell University. Irene starred solo in about a dozen silent films between 1917 and 1924, including &quot;Patria&quot; (1917), and appeared in several more stage productions before retiring from show business. Treman reportedly invested Castle&#x27;s money and lost it in the stock market. They divorced in 1923. She married two more times; the same year, she married Frederic McLaughlin (a man 16 years her elder), and two years after he died in 1944, she married George Enzinger (died 1959), an advertising executive from Chicago. During her marriage to &quot;Major&quot; McLaughlin, who was the founding owner of the Chicago Blackhawks, she is credited with designing the original sweater for the Blackhawks Hockey Club. She had two children with McLaughlin, Barbara McLaughlin Kreutz (1925–2003), who was Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Bryn Mawr College, and William Foote McLaughlin (1929–2012).

Mostly retired from dancing after William&#x27;s birth in 1929, Castle concentrated on animal rights activism. Around 1930, &quot;the best-dressed woman in America&quot; presented serialized, quarter-hour radio dramatizations of her European travels with her husband, bulldog Zowie, and Walter (&quot;father&#x27;s coloured servant&quot;) around the capitals of Europe in &quot;The Life of Irene Castle&quot;. Only one episode (episode #4) is known to exist.
In 1939, the Castles&#x27; lives were turned into a movie, &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot;, produced by RKO and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Edna May Oliver played their agent, and Lew Fields was his 33 years younger self. Irene Castle served as a technical advisor on the film, but clashed with Rogers, who refused to wear Castle&#x27;s trademark short bob or darken her hair. She objected to Rogers&#x27; inauthentic wardrobe demands, although a number of Castle&#x27;s original Lucile gowns were copied for the movie. Castle also protested the hiring of white actor Walter Brennan to play their faithful friend and manservant Walter, who was black.

For the rest of her life, Castle was a staunch animal-rights activist, ultimately founding the Riverwoods, Illinois, animal shelter &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; in 1928, which is still active as of 2023. In 1958, she appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Castle and her fourth husband moved to Destiny Farm in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1954.

Irene died at her Arkansas farm on 25 January 1969, aged 75. She was interred with Vernon at Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City.

<doc id="409823" wikidata="Q1137427" url="?curid=409823" title="Happy End (band)">
<text>was a Japanese folk rock band active from 1969 to 1972. Composed of Haruomi Hosono, Takashi Matsumoto, Eiichi Ohtaki and Shigeru Suzuki, the band&#x27;s pioneering sound was regarded as avant-garde to most Japanese at the time. They are considered to be among the most influential artists in Japanese music, with &quot;Mikiki&quot; crediting them with laying the foundation for Japanese rock. MTV described Happy End&#x27;s music as &quot;rock with psych smudges around the edges.&quot;

==History==
===Career===
When his band Burns needed a bass player, drummer Takashi Matsumoto reached out to Haruomi Hosono, a Rikkyo University student whom he heard was quite skilled. After playing shows together, Hosono eventually invited Matsumoto to join the psychedelic rock band Apryl Fool, which the drummer described as being influenced by bands like Vanilla Fudge, &quot;really progressive sounds for the time.&quot; When their keyboardist, Hiro Yanagida, started getting more into music like Buffalo Springfield and the West Coast sound that was becoming popular, Matsumoto said Hosono got into it too, and &quot;we started shifting toward that style.&quot; However, the relationships between band members deteriorated between the April 1969 recording of their debut album and its September release date, so Apryl Fool decided to break up in October 1969.

Hosono, Matsumoto and vocalist Chu Kosaka had planned to form another band together, but Kosaka joined a production of &quot;Hair&quot;, so Eiichi Ohtaki, who had played with Hosono in a folk act reminiscent of The Kingston Trio, was recruited in his stead. Hosono chose as the name of the new band because he would get depressed on Valentine&#x27;s Day. In December, Shigeru Suzuki, who already had a reputation as a skilled guitarist in the band Skye, was invited to join after Hosono and Matsumoto heard him improvise over what would become &quot;Juuni Gatsu no Ame no hi&quot;. In March 1970, Hosono, Matsumoto and Suzuki contributed to Kenji Endo&#x27;s album &quot;Niyago&quot;. The group were also the backing band for Nobuyasu Okabayashi, performing on his album &quot;Miru Mae ni Tobe&quot;. In April 1970, Hosono decided to change the band&#x27;s name. He chose Happy End based on Matsumoto&#x27;s lyrics to the song of the same name. Matsumoto stated that at the time Happy End started, they were influenced by Moby Grape, Buffalo Springfield, and the Grateful Dead.

After Hosono bumped into Eiji Ogura, director of URC (Underground Record Club), Japan&#x27;s first independent record label, he offered Happy End a recording contract and they began recording their own album in April 1970. Their self-titled debut album (written in Japanese as ) was released in August. It marked an important turning point in Japanese music history, as it sparked what would be known as the . There were highly publicized debates held between prominent figures in the Japanese rock industry, most notably the members of Happy End and Yuya Uchida, regarding whether rock music sung entirely in Japanese was sustainable. Previously, almost all popular rock music in Japan was sung in English. The success of Happy End&#x27;s debut album and their second, &quot;Kazemachi Roman&quot; released a year later, proved the sustainability of Japanese-language rock in Japan.

For their third album, also titled &quot;Happy End&quot; (this time written in the Latin alphabet), they signed with King Records and recorded in 1972 in Los Angeles with Van Dyke Parks producing. Although Hosono later described the work with Parks as &quot;productive,&quot; the album sessions were tenuous, and the members of Happy End were disenchanted with their vision of America they had anticipated. A language barrier along with opposition between the Los Angeles studio personnel and Happy End was also apparent, which further frustrated the group. These feelings were conveyed in the closing track &quot;Sayonara America, Sayonara Nippon&quot;, which received some contributions from Parks and Little Feat guitarist Lowell George. As Matsumoto explained: &quot;We had already given up on Japan, and with [that song], we were saying bye-bye to America too—we weren&#x27;t going to belong to any place.&quot; While the band officially disbanded on December 31, 1972, the album was released in February 1973. They had their last concert on September 21, 1973, titled City -Last Time Around, with a live album of the show released as &quot;Live Happy End&quot; the following year. In 2023, Matsumoto said he did not really know why Happy End broke up. Although he had a theory, he said he could not disclose it, and Suzuki suggested it might be better to leave it a mystery.

===Post-activities===
After breaking up, all four members continued to work together and contribute to each other&#x27;s solo albums and projects. Hosono and Suzuki formed Tin Pan Alley with Masataka Matsutoya, before Hosono started the pioneering electronic music act Yellow Magic Orchestra and Suzuki continued work as a guitarist and solo musician. Matsumoto became one of the most successful lyricists in the country and Ohtaki worked as a songwriter and solo artist, releasing one of Japan&#x27;s best-selling and most critically acclaimed albums, &quot;A Long Vacation&quot; in 1981. Happy End reunited for a one-off performance at the concert on June 15, 1985, which was released as the live album &quot;The Happy End&quot; later that same year.

An album called &quot;Happy End Parade ~Tribute to Happy End~&quot; and composed of covers of their songs by different artists was released in 2002. Hosono was involved in selecting the contributors and in Kicell&#x27;s cover of &quot;Shin Shin Shin&quot;, Matsumoto determined the cover art and title, and Suzuki participated in Yōichi Aoyama&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hana Ichi Monme&quot;. In 2003, their song &quot;Kaze wo Atsumete&quot; appeared in the American movie &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; and on its soundtrack.

Eiichi Ohtaki died on December 30, 2013, from a dissecting aneurysm at the age of 65. For the 2015 tribute album &quot;Kazemachi de Aimashō&quot;, commemorating Matsumoto&#x27;s 45th anniversary as a lyricist, Matsumoto, Hosono and Suzuki recorded the previously unreleased Happy End song . A special two-day concert for the same anniversary was held at the Tokyo International Forum on August 21–22, 2015 featuring numerous artists. Matsumoto, Hosono and Suzuki opened each day by performing &quot;Natsu Nandesu&quot; and &quot;Hana Ichi Monme&quot;, immediately followed by &quot;Haikara Hakuchi&quot; with Motoharu Sano. They also closed the shows with &quot;Shūu no Machi&quot;, and finally &quot;Kaze wo Atsumete&quot; alongside a number of other artists.

The three surviving members of Happy End reunited again on November 5–6, 2021 for a two-day concert, that also featured numerous other artists, at the Nippon Budokan to celebrate Matsumoto&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Also in 2021, Suzuki&#x27;s band Skye recorded the unreleased Happy End song for their self-titled album.

==Legacy==
Happy End are credited as the first rock act to sing in Japanese. Matsumoto later reflected that, &quot;There were two strings of music back in the day. You had &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;, old-style Japanese pop music that had already existed, and then group sounds. There were bands tied to that latter movement like The Golden Cups and The Spiders, who were active in the Yokohama scene, which was a really interesting music community because it had a huge American influence owing to the navy base in nearby Yokosuka. Their singles would have an A-side, that was more like &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;, but the B-side would have something more psychedelic, more genuine rock. That gap between the two sides felt strange to me and the other members of Happy End, so we decided to not worry about whether what we created would sell. We just wanted to do something original. If you make something original, it&#x27;s probably better to sing it in Japanese.&quot; Although, he did note that Hosono had initially felt that they should sing in English; &quot;I think Hosono-san had the intention of wanting to do something that would go beyond just Japan. For me, I wanted to share something that was good about everyday Japanese life. That was the basis of my lyrics. It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s interesting to people even beyond Japan, but I actually think it would have needed a really good translator to connect.&quot;

According to music critic Ian Martin, Happy End pioneered a style of songwriting that combined Japanese-language lyrics with Western-influenced folk rock in a one-syllable one-note rhythmic form. In 2012, Michael K. Bourdaghs wrote, “For Matsumoto, the Japanese language was above all a source of raw material for use in experimentation. [...] for Happy End, the Japanese language functioned not as a repository of tradition or identity but as an alienated and alienating tongue — a source of noise.” Singer-songwriter Sachiko Kanenobu wrote that &quot;they had a poetic way of writing that was never part of Japanese rock music before&quot;.

Happy End&#x27;s music has been cited as one of the origins of modern &quot;J-pop&quot;, with each member continuing to contribute to its development after the group&#x27;s break up. The band is also considered progenitors of what would become the &quot;City Pop&quot; style. Masataka Miyanaga, Japanese music critic and founder and professor of Beatles University at Kanazawa University, wrote that, given the impact they had, it would not be an exaggeration to call Happy End the &quot;Japanese Beatles&quot;. Matsumoto said, &quot;We literally had no promotion, and they stopped selling our albums shortly after they came out — everything afterward was a re-issue. But the important thing about Happy End is that parents show it to their kids. Older workers show it to new co-workers. The older students share it with younger classmates. That&#x27;s how our music has passed down.&quot;

In 2003, Happy End were ranked by HMV Japan at number 4 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. Ohtaki and Hosono also appear on the list as solo artists, ranked number 9 and 44 respectively. In September 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; named &quot;Kazemachi Roman&quot; the greatest Japanese rock album of all time. It was also named number 15 on &quot;Bounce&quot;″s 2009 list of 54 Standard Japanese Rock Albums.

<doc id="409824" wikidata="Q5215255" url="?curid=409824" title="Dance in mythology and religion">
<text>Dance is present in mythology and religion globally. Dance has certainly been an important part of ceremony, rituals, celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations. Archeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as the 5,000-year-old Bhimbetka rock shelters paintings in India and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC.

One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of &quot;love making.&quot; Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.

Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to ecstatic trance states in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert.

An early manuscript describing dance is the Natya Shastra on which is based the &quot;modern&quot; interpretation of classical Indian dance (e.g. Bharathanatyam).

== Greek mythology ==

In a classical Greek song, Apollo, the god of medicine, music and poetry, one of the twelve greater gods and son of the chief god Zeus, was called The Dancer. In a Greek line Zeus himself is represented as dancing. Terpsichore is one of the nine Muses, representing dancing and dramatic chorus. In Sparta, a province of ancient Greece, the law compelled parents to exercise their children in dancing from the age of five years. They were led by grown men, and sang hymns and songs as they danced. 
In very early times a Greek chorus, consisting of the whole population of the city, would meet in the market-place to offer up thanksgivings to the god of the country. Their jubilees were always attended with hymn-singing and dancing.

==Dance in scriptures==
The Torah, the Psalms, and many other scriptures reference dance:

Old Testament
*A Time to Dance:
**Ecclesiastes 3:4
*Social Dance in celebration of what God has done:
**Exodus 15:20;
**Judges 21:21 - 23
*In celebration before the Lord:
**2 Samuel 6:14-16;
**1 Chronicles 15:29
*Social dancing in celebration of a god:
**Exodus 32:19;
**1 Kings 18:26 (The act of celebrating a false god is condemned here)
*A child&#x27;s dance:
**Judges 11:34;
**Job 21:11
*Celebration of warriors:
**1 Samuel 18:6-7;
**1 Samuel 21:11;
**1 Samuel 29:5;
*As an expression of happiness:
**Psalm 30:11;
**Lamentations 5:15;
*In Worship to the Lord:
**Psalm 149:3;
**Psalm 150:4
*Social Dance with Friends:
**Jeremiah 31:4;
**Jeremiah 31:13
*A Lovers Dance:
**Song of Solomon 6:13

**Luke 7:32
*For the king: 
**Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:22

===Hindu scriptures===

From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja. In the Hindu scriptures, every god has his or her own style (lasya and tandava respectively represent two aspects of dance) we read about 23 celestial beings called Apsarases who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in the Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses devadasi&#x27;s worshiped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. Natyashastra is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the classical Indian dancers are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

===Buddhism===

===Chinese mythology===
*Lion dance

===Christianity ===
In the Protoevangelium of James, it is reported that Mary danced before the Ark of the Covenant in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time of her presentation.

Throughout the history of Christianity, several denominations and independent congregations prohibited social dancing for various reasons; however, dance has always been a part of the social life of many Christians. Christian lyrics are found in the sounds of Ballroom, Country, Rock and Roll, Latin, Night Club, and other dance music. Ballet originated in Italy at weddings.

Numerous examples of traditional dance can be found in modern Roman Catholic communities. The Brazilian dance and martial art of capoeira (particularly capoeira angola) is regularly performed—including between &quot;capoeiristas&quot; of different sexes—to lyrics and &quot;ladinhas&quot; (litanies) praising God, the saints, and the Virgin. In a similar vein, several genres of dance music in Romani people/Romani culture involve religious themes and lyrics. In the Philippines, the &quot;Subli&quot;—a devotional dance of the Catholic Tagalogs in Batangas Province—honours the True Cross. Finally, the celebrations of Carnival and Mardi Gras feature dance.

Many Charismatic and Pentecostal Protestant denominations practice dance during worship services. Congregants frequently dance during services as an act of worship. Some Charismatics practice prophetic dance, a religious practice in which practitioners believe they are representing what the Lord is doing through their movements. This is often accompanied with banners, ribbons and, instruments. Bethel Church in Redding, California has a school where people who wished to be trained in prophetic dance can go.

<doc id="409825" wikidata="Q132452" url="?curid=409825" title="Troodontidae">
<text>Troodontidae is a clade of bird-like theropod dinosaurs from the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous. During most of the 20th century, troodontid fossils were few and incomplete and they have therefore been allied, at various times, with many dinosaurian lineages. More recent fossil discoveries of complete and articulated specimens (including specimens which preserve feathers, eggs, embryos, and complete juveniles), have helped to increase understanding about this group. Anatomical studies, particularly studies of the most primitive troodontids, like &quot;Sinovenator&quot;, demonstrate striking anatomical similarities with &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and primitive dromaeosaurids, and demonstrate that they are relatives comprising a clade called Paraves.

== Evolution ==
The oldest definitive troodontid known is &quot;Hesperornithoides&quot; from the Late Jurassic of Wyoming. The slightly older &quot;Koparion&quot; of Utah is only represented by a single tooth, and small maniraptoran teeth from the Middle Jurassic of England were identified as those of indeterminate troodontids in 2023. Over the Cretaceous, troodontids radiated throughout western North America, Asia, and Europe, suggesting a mostly Laurasian distribution for the group. However, in 2013, a single diagnostic tooth from the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Kallamedu Formation of southern India was identified as a troodontid, suggesting that troodontids either also inhabited Gondwana or managed to disperse to India from elsewhere prior to its separation as an island continent. The potential Gondwanan occurrence of troodontids is supported by the existence of Middle Jurassic remains, which suggest that they originated prior to the breakup of Pangaea. However, due to the lack of other remains from the region, it has been suggested that the existence of Gondwanan troodontids should be regarded as provisional.

==Description==
Troodontids are a group of small, bird-like, maniraptorans. All troodontids have unique features of the skull, such as large numbers of closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, suggesting that they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. They had unusually long legs compared to other theropods, with a large, curved claw on their retractable second toes, similar to the &quot;sickle-claw&quot; of the dromaeosaurids. However, the sickle-claws of troodontids were not as large or recurved as in dromaeosaurids, and in some instances could not be held off the ground and &quot;retracted&quot; to the same degree. In at least one troodontid, &quot;Borogovia&quot;, the second toe could not be held far off the ground at all and the claw was straight, not curved or sickle-like.

Troodontids had unusually large brains among dinosaurs, comparable to those of living flightless birds. Their eyes were also large, and pointed forward, indicating that they had good binocular vision. The ears of troodontids were also unusual among theropods, having enlarged middle ear cavities, indicating acute hearing ability. The placement of this cavity near the eardrum may have aided in the detection of low-frequency sounds. In some troodontids, ears were also asymmetrical, with one ear placed higher on the skull than the other, a feature shared only with some owls. The specialization of the ears may indicate that troodontids hunted in a manner similar to owls, using their hearing to locate small prey.

===Diet===
Although most paleontologists believe that they were predatory carnivores, the many small, coarsely serrated teeth, large denticle size, and U-shaped jaws of some species (particularly &quot;Troodon&quot;) suggest that some species may have been omnivorous or herbivorous. Some suggest that the large denticle size is reminiscent of the teeth of extant iguanine lizards. In contrast, a few species, such as &quot;Byronosaurus&quot;, had large numbers of needle-like teeth, which seem best-suited for picking up small prey, such as birds, lizards and small mammals. Other morphological characteristics of the teeth, such as the detailed form of the denticles and the presence of blood grooves, also seem to indicate carnivory. Analyses of barium/calcium and strontium/calcium ratios, which are higher in carnivores due to bioaccumulation, found low ratios in teeth of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot;, suggesting that it had a diet ranging from mixed to plant-dominant omnivory. Though little is known directly about the predatory behavior of troodontids, Fowler and colleagues theorize that the longer legs and smaller sickle claws (as compared to dromaeosaurids) indicate a more cursorial lifestyle, though the study indicates that troodontids were still likely to have used the unguals for prey manipulation. The proportions of the metatarsals, tarsals and unguals of troodontids appear indicative of their having nimbler, but weaker feet, perhaps better adapted for capturing and subduing smaller prey. This suggests an ecological separation from the slower but more powerful Dromaeosauridae.

==Classification==
Troodontid fossils were among the first dinosaur remains described. Initially, Leidy (1856) assumed they were lacertilian (lizards), but, by 1924, they were referred to Dinosauria by Gilmore, who suggested that they were ornithischians and allied them with the pachycephalosaurian &quot;Stegoceras&quot; in a Troodontidae. It was not until 1945 that C.M. Sternberg recognized Troodontidae as a theropod family. Since 1969, Troodontidae has typically been allied with Dromaeosauridae, in a clade (natural group) known as Deinonychosauria, but this was by no means a consensus. Holtz (in 1994) erected the clade Bullatosauria, uniting Ornithomimosauria (the &quot;ostrich-dinosaurs&quot;) and Troodontidae, on the basis of characteristics including, among others, an inflated braincase (&quot;parabasisphenoid&quot;) and a long, low opening in the upper jaw (the &quot;maxillary fenestra&quot;). Features of the pelvis also suggested they were less advanced than dromaeosaurids. New discoveries of primitive troodontids from China (such as &quot;Sinovenator&quot; and &quot;Mei&quot;), however, display strong similarities between Troodontidae, Dromaeosauridae and the primitive bird &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, and most paleontologists, including Holtz, now consider troodontids to be much more closely related to birds than they are to ornithomimosaurs, causing the clade Bullatosauria to be abandoned.

One study of theropod systematics by members of the has uncovered striking similarities among the most basal dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. This clade is together called Paraves by Novas and Pol. The extensive cladistic analysis conducted by Turner &quot;et al.&quot;, (2012) supported the monophyly of Troodontidae.

===Phylogeny===
There are multiple possibilities of the genera included in Troodontidae as well as how they are related. Very primitive species, such as &quot;Anchiornis huxleyi&quot;, have alternately been found to be early troodontids, early members of the closely related group Avialae, or more primitive paravians by various studies. The cladogram below follows the results of a study by Lefèvre &quot;et al.&quot; 2017.
Shen &quot;et al.&quot; (2017a) explored troodontid phylogeny using a modified version of the Tsuihiji &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) analysis. It was in turn based on data published by Gao &quot;et al.&quot; (2012), a slightly modified version of the Xu &quot;et al.&quot; (2011) analysis, focusing on advanced troodontids. A simplified version is shown below.

In 2014, Brusatte, Lloyd, Wang and Norell published an analysis on Coelurosauria, based on data from Turner &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) who named a third subfamily of troodontids, Jinfengopteryginae. Their analysis included more basal troodontid species but failed to resolve many of their interrelationships, resulting in large &quot;polytomies&quot; (sets of species where the branching order in the family tree is uncertain). An updated version of the Brusatte &quot;et al.&quot; analysis was provided by Shen &quot;et at.&quot; (2017b), who included more taxa and recovered greater resolution. Shen &quot;et at.&quot; named a fourth subfamily of troodontids, the Sinovenatorinae. A simplified version of their analysis is shown below.
Troodontinae is a subfamily of troodontid dinosaurs. The subfamily was first used in 2017 for the group of troodontids descended from the last common ancestor of &quot;Gobivenator mongoliensis&quot; and &quot;Zanabazar junior,&quot; but has been redefined to be the least inclusive clade containing &quot;Saurornithoides mongoliensis&quot; and &quot;Troodon formosus,&quot; utilizing the type species of the clade. Below is a cladogram of the Troodontinae as published by Aaron van der Reest and Phil Currie, in 2017.
==Paleobiology==

Many troodontid nests, including eggs that contain fossilized embryos, have been described. Hypotheses about troodontid reproduction have been developed from this evidence (see &quot;Troodon&quot;). A few troodont fossils, including specimens of &quot;Mei&quot; and &quot;Sinornithoides&quot;, demonstrate that these animals roosted like birds, with their heads tucked under their forelimbs. These fossils, as well as numerous skeletal similarities to birds and related feathered dinosaurs, support the idea that troodontids probably bore a bird-like feathered coat. The discovery of fully feathered, primitive troodontids, such as &quot;Jianianhualong&quot;, lend support to this.

In 2004, Mark Norell and colleagues described two partial troodontid skulls (specimen numbers IGM 100/972 and IGM 100/974) found in a nest of oviraptorid eggs in the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia. The nest is quite certainly that of an oviraptorosaur, since an oviraptorid embryo is still preserved inside one of the eggs. The two partial troodontid skulls were first described by Norell et al. (1994) as dromaeosaurids, but reassigned to the troodontid &quot;Byronosaurus&quot; after further study. The troodontids were either hatchlings or embryos, and fragments of eggshell are adhered to them although it seems to be oviraptorid eggshell. The presence of tiny troodontids in an oviraptorid nest is an enigma. Hypotheses explaining how they came to be there include that they were the prey of the adult oviraptorid, that they were there to prey on oviraptorid hatchlings, or that some troodontids may have been nest parasites.

===Feeding===
Troodontid feeding was discovered to be typical of coelurosaurian theropods, with a characteristic &quot;puncture and pull&quot; feeding method seen also in such theropods as the dromaeosauridae and tyrannosauridae. Studies of wear patterns on the teeth of dromaeosaurids by Angelica Torices &quot;et al.&quot;, indicate that dromaeosaurid teeth share similar wear patterns to those seen in the aforementioned groups. However, micro wear on the teeth indicated that dromaeosaurids likely preferred larger prey items than the troodontids with which they often shared their environment. Such differences in dietary preferences likely allowed them to inhabit the same ecosystems. The same study also indicated that dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot; (two dromaeosaurids analyzed in the study) likely included bone in their diet and were better adapted to handle struggling prey while troodontids, equipped with weaker jaws, preyed on softer-bodied animals and prey items such as invertebrates and carrion that either was immobile or could likely be swallowed whole. Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios found in the enamel of North American troodontids indicate that they were mixed-feeding to plant-dominant omnivores.

===Flight===

Compared to most other paravians, troodontids are unspecialised for aerial locomotion. However, &quot;Jinfengopteryx&quot; ranks closely with non-avian theropods known to engage in powered flight like &quot;Microraptor&quot; and &quot;Rahonavis&quot;.

====Bird evolution====
Troodontids are important in research into the origin of birds because they share many anatomical characters with early birds. Crucially, the substantially complete &quot;Hesperornithoides&quot; (&quot;Lori&quot;) is a troodontid from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, close to the time of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. The discovery of Jurassic troodonts is positive physical evidence that derived deinonychosaurs were present before the time that avians arose. This fact strongly invalidates the &quot;temporal paradox&quot; cited by the few remaining opponents of the idea that birds are closely related to dinosaurs.

<doc id="409826" wikidata="Q14875138" url="?curid=409826" title="Don Mills">
<text>Don Mills is a mixed-use neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to be a self-supporting &quot;new town&quot; and was at the time located outside Toronto proper in the suburb of North York. Consisting of residential, commercial and industrial sub-districts, it was planned and developed by private enterprise.

In several ways it became the blueprint for postwar suburban development in Toronto and contemporary residential neighbourhoods. It is bounded by York Mills Road to the north, Canadian Pacific Railway to the south, Leslie Street to the west, and Don Valley Parkway to the east. It is part of federal and provincial electoral district Don Valley East, and Toronto electoral ward 16: Don Valley East.

==History==
The Don Mills area was first settled by Europeans in 1817. The area was a considerable distance from the town of York, but the Don River provided an easy means of transportation, and also a source of power for a number of mills along its length.

While the city of Toronto steadily expanded, the Don Mills area remained rural until after the Second World War. It was cut off from the city by ravines to the south, east, and west. Only two roads connected to the area: York Mills Road and Don Mills Road. In 1950 the area consisted of about 20 farms.

===Development===

Don Mills was designed as a model community between 1952 and 1965. Land use, architectural design and building materials were carefully regulated. Many aspects of its design have been imitated in suburban developments across Canada. Its planners would give people priority over industry and cars.

This combination of emptiness and proximity to the city attracted the attention of industrialist E.P. Taylor. His original plan was to erect a brewery on the site, along with a small community to house the workers. Taylor had limited previous experience in the property development business, but had built a project named the Wrentham Estates in York Mills. Seeing the profit to be made with such projects, Taylor abandoned the brewery idea and decided to simply build a new town on the he had acquired.

In 1951, he began planning the Yorktown community (as it was first known), and it was announced on March 11, 1953. The community was to be built on about of farmland centred at the intersection of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East, with an expected cost of $200 million. Development was headed by the Taylor-owned Don Mills Development Company, (known as O&#x27;Keefe Realty in the days of the brewery development).

====Design principles====
The design of Don Mills was influenced by Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s Garden City, and by the principles of two American town planners, Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, who developed the garden city community of Radburn, New Jersey. Design of the project was entrusted to Macklin Hancock, the son-in-law of Taylor&#x27;s executive assistant. Still in his mid-20s, Hancock was a graduate student at Harvard when approached for the job. At Harvard Hancock had studied under a number of the founders of modernism and new town planning including Walter Gropius, William Holford, and Hideo Sasaki.

These studies led Hancock to envision a self-contained community distinguished by consistent design principles and a modernist style. Several names were proposed for the new development, including Eptown after Taylor. It was called Yorktown at its initial unveiling, but the name Don Mills was finally adopted at the suggestion of Hancock.

The design was based on five planning principles, which had not been implemented in Canada before:

#The neighbourhood principle – which broke down the community into four neighbourhood quadrants, all surrounding a regional shopping centre, Don Mills Centre, at the southwest corner of Don Mills and Lawrence. Each quadrant was to contain a school, a church, and a park.
#Separation of pedestrian and vehicle traffic – which was accomplished through the creation of a network of pedestrian paths providing easy access through parks to area schools and the town centre, while roads were designed to slow vehicular traffic through the use of winding roads, T-intersections, and cul-de-sacs.
#Promotion of modernist architecture and the modern aesthetic – Don Mills Development controlled the architectural design, colours, and materials of all buildings in Don Mills. As well, the corporation insisted that builders use company-approved architects who had been educated according to Bauhaus principles, to prevent the project from deteriorating into a typical post-war subdivision of builder&#x27;s homes.
#Creation of a greenbelt – linked to a system of neighbourhood parks that would preserve the beauty of the surrounding ravines.
#Integration of industry into the community – which followed Howard&#x27;s ideals for the Garden City. Planners felt that it was important for residents to live and work in the same satellite town so that Don Mills would not become a bedroom community. A sizable number of high residential densities—rental townhouses and low-rise apartments—was essential if the town were to attract a cross-section of residents working in local industries.

Home situation design was also influential to subsequent subdivisions in Canada. The homes were located on square lots with long street frontages. Houses were previously situated on rectangular lots, narrow end to the street. The square lots meant that houses faced the street with their long side, but had less deep backyards.

The developers also affected two highway projects being developed concurrently. The &#x27;Toronto Bypass&#x27;, now known as Ontario Highway 401 does not have an interchange at Don Mills Road due to the development. The Don Valley Parkway, built in part to service the community, was originally to be built on Don Mills Road, but was moved east to the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north of Lawrence.

===Recent history (2000–present)===
In 2006, Don Mills Centre was demolished to make way for Shops at Don Mills, a large shopping centre. The shopping centre opened in April 2009.

At Wynford Drive and the Don Valley Parkway, a new $300 million cultural project was built on of land. The project, whose foundation was laid on May 28, 2010 by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and His Highness the Aga Khan, is designed by award-winning architects: India-based Charles Correa, Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, Lebanese landscape architect Vladimir Djurovic and the Toronto-based Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects. 

The project was completed in 2014, with the opening of the Ismaili Centre, the Aga Khan Museum and a public park. The museum provides an exhibition space for Islamic art and history and it also provides a centre for the Ismaili community in Canada.

==Demographics==
The city places Don Mills in a community called Banbury-Don Mills. In 2006, it had a population of 25,435.

Major ethnic and cultural groups (by ancestry) in 2001:
* Chinese - 12%
* English - 11%
* Canadian - 11%
* Jewish - 7%
* Scottish - 7%
* Irish - 5%
* East Indian - 4%
* German - 3%
* French - 2%
* Polish - 2%
* Other - 36%
The percentage of population below the poverty line dropped from 13% (in 1996) to 12% (in 2001).

==Education==

The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a public school board that operates three elementary schools in Don Mills, Greenland Public School, Norman Ingram Public School, and Three Valleys Public School. TDSB also operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, Don Mills Collegiate Institute.

In addition to TDSB, three other public school boards also offer schooling to residents of Don Mills, the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), secular school board; and two French first language public school board, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM). However, none of the three school boards operate school in Don Mills, with CSCM, CSV, and TCDSB students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

==Recreation==

Don Mills is home to a number of municipal parks including Bond Park, which has sports fields and an arena, Chipping Park, and Moccasin Trail Park. The latter two parks are situated near the Don Valley, which forms a part of the Toronto ravine system. Municipal parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The neighbourhood is also home to the Don Mills branch of the Toronto Public Library.

Several retail outlets, and shopping malls are also located in Don Mills. Shops at Don Mills is a lifestyle center-styled shopping centre located at the southwest corner of Lawrence Avenue and Don Mills Road, on the site of the former Don Mills Centre.

==Transportation==
Several major roadways are situated in Don Mills, including Lawrence Avenue, and York Mills Road, which serves as the neighbourhood&#x27;s northern boundary. To the east, the neighbourhood is bounded by the Don Valley Parkway, a major municipal controlled access highway. Eglinton Avenue is a major roadway situated south of Don Mills.

Public transportation in Don Mills is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC operates several bus routes in the neighbourhood. The TTC plans for light rail service in the neighbourhood by 2024, with the opening of Line 5 Eglinton, a light rail line to be operated as a part of the Toronto subway system. Stations for the new line would be located along Eglinton Avenue, with Aga Khan Park &amp; Museum and Science Centre station situated just south of Don Mills. The neighbourhood serves as a transition point for Line 5 Eglinton, with the line operating as a surface level route for every stop east of Science Centre station.

<doc id="409830" wikidata="Q27730" url="?curid=409830" title="History of dance">
<text>The history of dance is difficult to access because dance does not often leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts that last over millennia, such as stone tools, hunting implements or cave paintings. It is not possible to identify with exact precision when dance becomes part of human culture. Dance is filled with aesthetic values, making it distinct from one society to another and is shrouded in symbolism that expounds on the cultural heritage of a community accordingly being unique from one society to another. Dance can help tell a story, convey feelings and emotions, and connect with others and ourselves.

== Early dance ==
The natural impulse to dance may have existed in early primates before they evolved into humans.
Dance has been an important part of ceremony, rituals, celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations. Archaeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as the 10,000-year-old Bhimbetka rock shelters paintings in India and Egyptian tomb depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC. Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial and ethnic dances of the ancient period.

===Means of social communication and bonding===
Dance may have been used as a tool of social interaction that promoted cooperation essential for survival among early humans. Studies found that today&#x27;s best dancers share two specific genes associated with a predisposition for being good social communicators.

Also, the term &quot;kinesthetic&quot; is the right term to help understanding how dance makes communication, and it means recognition of movement of one&#x27;s own body, this word is a combination of two words (Greek: &quot;kinein&quot; &quot;to move&quot;, &quot;aesthesis&quot; &quot;perception&quot;). So dance moves and background sounds play a big role too. When there is a group performance by holding hands or shoulders or even dancing opposite each other makes them feel communicated and bonded.

===As folk celebrations===

Many dances of the early periods were performed as a ritual to the gods who ancestors believed needed to be kept entertained for world peace. Dance used in many celebrations and until now. Throughout  history we can notice that dance had many uses such as also community dance, harvesting and worship. Dance evolution started as folk origins to court presentations and now theater or even cinema movies.

===In ceremonies and rituals===

Dance may be performed in religious or shamanic rituals, for example in rain dance performed in times of drought. Shamans dancing for rain is mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. Dance is an important aspect of some religious rites in ancient Egypt, similarly dance is also integral to many ceremonies and rites among African people. Ritual dances may also be performed in temples and during religious festivals, for example the Rasa ritual dances of India (a number of Indian classical dances may have their origin in ritual dances), and the Cham dances of Tibet.

===As a method of healing===
Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to ecstatic trance states in healing rituals. Dance is used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert. Medieval European &quot;danses macabres&quot; were thought to have protected participants from disease; however, the hysteria and duration of these dances sometimes led to death due to exhaustion.

According to a Sinhalese legend, Kandyan dances originated 2500 years ago from a magic dance ritual that broke the spell on a bewitched king to cure the king of a mysterious illness.

===As a method of expression===
One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of &quot;lovemaking&quot;. Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.

In European culture, one of the earliest records of dancing is by Homer, whose &quot;Iliad&quot; describes chorea (χορεία &quot;khoreia&quot;). The early Greeks made the art of dancing into a system, expressive of all the different passions. For example, the dance of the Furies, so represented, would create complete terror among those who witnessed them. The Greek philosopher, Aristotle, ranked dancing with poetry, and said that certain dancers, with rhythm applied to gesture, could express manners, passions, and actions. The most eminent Greek sculptors studied the attitude of the dancers for their art of imitating the passion.

==Cultural traditions==
===Asia===

====Indian classical dance====

An early manuscript describing dance is the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; on which is based the modern interpretation of classical Indian dance (e.g. Bharathanatyam).

During the reign of the last Mughals and Nawabs of Oudh, dance fell down to the status of &#x27;nautch&#x27;, an unethical sensuous thing of courtesans.

Later, linking dance with immoral trafficking and prostitution, British rule prohibited public performance of dance. Many disapproved it. In 1947, India won its freedom and created for dance an ambience where it could regain its past glory. Classical forms and regional distinctions were re-discovered, ethnic specialties were honored, and by synthesizing them with the individual talents of the masters in the line and fresh innovations, emerged dance with a new face but with classicism of the past.

In Sri Lanka, the ancient Sinhalese chronicle &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; states that when King Vijaya landed in Sri Lanka in 543 BCE he heard sounds of music and dancing from a wedding ceremony. The origins of the dances of Sri Lanka are dated back to the aboriginal tribes, and to the mythological times of aboriginal yingyang twins and &quot;yakkas&quot; (devils). The classical dances of Sri Lanka (Kandyan dances) feature a highly developed system of tala (rhythm) and provided by cymbals called thalampataa.

====Chinese dance====

There is a long recorded history of Chinese dances. Some of the dances mentioned in ancient texts, such as dancing with sleeve movements are still performed today. Some of the early dances were associated with shamanic rituals. Folk dances of the early period were also developed into court dances. The important dances of the ancient period were the ceremonial &quot;yayue&quot; dated to the Zhou dynasty of the first millennium BC. The art of dance in China reached its peak during the Tang dynasty, a period when dancers from many parts of the world also performed at the imperial court. However, Chinese opera became popular during the Song and Yuan dynasty, and many dances were merged into Chinese opera. The art of dance in women also declined from the Song dynasty onward as a result of the increasing popularity of footbinding, a practice that ironically may have originated from dancing when a dancer wrapped her feet so she may dance ballet-fashion. The best-known of the Chinese traditional dances are the dragon dance and lion dance. Lion dance was described in the Tang dynasty in form that resembles today&#x27;s dance.

The people of the Iranian plateau have known dance in the forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since the 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression. Artifacts with pictures of dancers, players or actors were found in many archaeological prehistoric sites in Iran, like Tepe Sabz, Ja&#x27;far Abad, Chogha Mish, Tall-e Jari, Cheshmeh Ali, Ismaeel Abad, Tal-e bakun, Tepe Sialk, Tepe Musian, tepe Yahya, Shahdad, Tepe Gian, Kul Farah, Susa, Kok Tepe, Cemeteries of Luristan, etc.

===== History =====
The earliest researched dance from historic Iran is a dance worshiping Mithra (as in the Cult of Mithras) in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the Roman Empire. This dance was to promote vigor in life. Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from Herodotus of Halikarnassos, in his work &quot;Book IX (Calliope)&quot;, in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC. Ancient Persia was occupied by foreign powers, first Greeks, then Arabs, and then Mongols and in turn political instability and civil wars occurred. Throughout these changes a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions occurred.

Religious prohibition of dancing in Iran came with the spread of Islam, but it was spurred by historical events. Religious prohibition to dancing waxed and waned over the years, but after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 dancing was no longer allowed due to its frequent mixing of the sexes. The Islamic Revolution of 1979 was the end of a successful era for dancing and the art of ballet in Iran. The Iranian national ballet company was dissolved and its members emigrated to different countries. According to the principles of the &quot;cultural revolution&quot; in Iran, dancing was considered to be perverse, a great sin, immoral and corrupting. As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and a new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora.

===Europe===

====15th–19th centuries: from court dancing to Romanticism====
The origins of ballet dancing can be traced to the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Dance masters would teach the steps to nobility and the court would participate in performances as a form of social entertainment. This practice continued for several centuries. In the 17th century, courtly ballet reached its peak under the rule of King Louis XIV.

By the 18th century, ballet had migrated from the French and Italian royal courts to the Paris Opéra under the careful direction of composer/dancer Jean-Baptiste Lully. Lully sought to develop ballet into more serious art. Under his influence, ballet was turned into a recognized art that was performed by professional dancers rather than courtiers.

During the 18th century, ballet transitioned from a courtly dance of moving images as a spectacle to performance art in its own right. Ballet performances developed around a central narrative and contained an expressive movement that revealed the relationships between characters. This dramatic style of ballet became known as the ballet d&#x27;action. The ballet d&#x27;action strove to express, for the first time, human emotions drawn directly from the dancers themselves. Masks previously worn by performers were removed so that emotional content could be derived from facial expressions.

Costumes during this time were very restricting for dancers. Although a more expressive use of the body was encouraged, dancers&#x27; movements were still restricted due to heavy materials and corseted dresses. Costumes often covered a dancer&#x27;s physique and made it difficult to see complex or intricate choreography. It was not until choreographer Jean Georges Noverre called for dance reforms in 1760 with his &quot;Letters on Dancing and Ballets&quot; that costumes became more conducive. Noverre urged that costumes be crafted using lightweight fabrics that move fluidly with the body, complementing a dancer&#x27;s figure. In addition, dancers wore soft slippers that fit snugly along the foot. This shoe design instilled confidence within the ballerina, daring her to dance on her toes. Naturalistic costuming allowed dancers to push the boundaries of movement, eventually rising en pointe.

The era of Romanticism produced ballets inspired by fantasy, mystique, and the unfamiliar cultures of exotic places. Ballets that focused more on the emotions, the fantasy and the spiritual worlds and heralded the beginning of true pointe-work. Now, on her toes, the deified ballerina (embodied in this period by the legendary ballerina Marie Taglioni) seemed to magically skim the surface of the stage, an ethereal being never quite touching the ground. It was during this period that the ascending star of the ballerina quite eclipsed the presence of the poor male dancer, who was in many cases reduced to the status of a moving statue, present only in order to lift the ballerina. This sad state was really only redressed by the rise of the male ballet star Vaslav Nijinsky, with the Ballets Russes, in the early 20th century. Ballet as we know it had well and truly evolved by this time, with all the familiar conventions of costume, choreographic form, plot, pomp, and circumstance firmly fixed in place. Nijinsky brought athleticism into ballet. Although at that time his choreography was considered as controversial, now they are considered as one of the first contemporary ballets.

====Early 20th century: from ballet to contemporary dance====
Since the Ballets Russes began revolutionizing ballet in the early 20th century, there have been continued attempts to break the mold of classical ballet. Currently the artistic scope of ballet technique (and its accompanying music, jumper, and multimedia) is more all-encompassing than ever. The boundaries that classify a work of classical ballet are constantly being stretched, muddied and blurred until perhaps all that remains today are traces of technique idioms such as turnout.

The 20th century was indeed a period of breaking away from everything that ballet stood for. It was a time of unprecedented creative growth, for dancers and choreographers. It was also a time of the broadening of the definition of dance. Ballets Russes was a turning point to the future of ballet in the West and in the world. Collaborating with that era geniuses, such as Coco Chanel, Pablo Picasso and others. Ballets Russes brought together great music, design and dance together in a one complete performance.

=== Africa ===

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;African dance refers mainly to the dance styles of Sub-Saharan Africa, of which many are based on traditional rhythms and music traditions of the region. Modern African dance styles are deeply rooted in culture and tradition. Many tribes have a role solely for the purpose of passing on the tribe&#x27;s dance traditions; dances which have been passed down through the centuries, often unchanged, with little to no room for improvisation. Each tribe developed its own unique style of dance, falling into three categories based on purpose. The first is religious dancing, which many tribes purport enhances peace, health, and prosperity. Religious dances often involved masqueraders, performing as both the spirits and those who placated them. Religion and spirituality infused every part of traditional African life, and continues to affect African dance today. The second is griotic, and was a type of dance that told a story. It is named after a &quot;griot&quot;, which is a term for a traditional storyteller in West Africa. Certain griotic dances were only danced by the tribe&#x27;s &quot;griot;&quot; today, troupes perform the same dances that were once exclusive to the &quot;griot&quot;. The third type is ceremonial. These dances are performed at ceremonies such as weddings, anniversaries, and rites of passage. However, many dances did not have only one purpose. Rather, there was often one primary purpose, that blended into many secondary purposes. Dance was often very important to the maintenance of a ruler&#x27;s status in the tribal society. Colonialism and globalization have resulted in the eradication of certain styles of African dance. Other styles have been blended together, or mixed with dance styles outside of Africa. 

==== African dance in the context of slavery ====
As people were taken from Africa to be sold as slaves, especially starting in the 1500s, they brought their dance styles with them. Entire cultures were imported into the New World, especially those areas where slaves were given more flexibility to continue their cultures and where there were more African slaves than Europeans or indigenous Americans, such as Brazil. African dance styles were merged with new cultural experiences to form new styles of dance. For example, slaves responded to the fears of their masters about high-energy styles of dance with changing stepping to shuffling. However, in North America, slaves did not have as much freedom to continue their culture and dance. In many cases, these dances have evolved into modern dance styles, such as African-American dance and Brazilian dance. For example, the Calenda evolved in Brazil from tribal dance. The Calenda then evolved into the Cakewalk, which was danced originally to mock plantation owners; it then evolved into the Charleston. Capoeira was a martial art practiced originally in Africa which the enslaved Africans masked as a form of dance in order to not arouse the suspicion of plantation owners.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==The late 20th and early 21st centuries==

=== Postmodernism ===
After the explosion of modern dance in the early 20th century, the 1960s saw the growth of postmodernism. Postmodernism veered towards simplicity, the beauty of small things, the beauty of untrained body, and unsophisticated movement. The famous &quot;No&quot; manifesto, by Yvonne Rainer, rejecting all costumes, stories and outer trappings in favour of raw and unpolished movement was perhaps the extreme of this wave of thinking. However, it was not long before sets, décor and shock value re-entered the vocabulary of modern choreographers.

=== Street dance ===
At the same time, mass culture experienced expansion of street dance. In 1973, famous group Jackson 5 performed on television a dance called &quot;Robot&quot; (choreographed by postmodern artist Michael Jackson), a dance form cultivated in Richmond, CA. This event and later Soul Train performances by black dancers (such as Don Cambell) ignited a street culture revolution, in a sense. B-boying in New York, Locking in L.A., Popping in Fresno, CA, Boogaloo in Oakland, CA, Robot in Richmond, CA, all had their own creative explosions happen around the late &#x27;60s–&#x27;70s. Each with its own histories, practices, innovators and foundations.

Hip-hop dance started when Clive Campbell, aka Kool DJ Herc and the father of hip-hop, came to New York from Jamaica in 1967. Toting the seeds of reggae from his homeland, he is credited with being the first DJ to use two turntables and identical copies of the same record to create his jams. But it was his extension of the breaks in these songs—the musical section where the percussive beats were most aggressive—that allowed him to create and name a culture of break boys and break girls who laid it down when the breaks came up. Briefly termed b-boys and b-girls, these dancers founded breakdancing, which is now a cornerstone of hip-hop dance.

<doc id="409834" wikidata="Q1054058" url="?curid=409834" title="Frippertronics">
<text>Frippertronics is a tape looping technique used by English guitarist Robert Fripp. It marked the first real-time tape looping device, evolving from a system developed in the electronic music studios of the early 1960s by composers Terry Riley and Pauline Oliveros and made popular through its use in ambient music by composer Brian Eno, as on his album &quot;Discreet Music&quot; (1975). The effect is now routinely found in many commercial loop station guitar digital effects boxes such as the Boss RC-3.

==Technology==
Frippertronics is an analogue delay system consisting of two side-by-side reel-to-reel tape recorders. The machines are configured so that the tape travels from the supply reel of the first machine to the take-up reel of the second, allowing sound recorded by the first machine to be played back on the second machine. The audio of the second machine is then routed back to the first, causing the delayed signal to repeat, while new audio is mixed in with it. The length of the delay (usually three to five seconds) is controlled by the distance between the two machines, and the number of repeats is controlled by the volume on the second machine.

Fripp used this technique to dynamically create recordings containing layer upon layer of electric guitar sounds in real time. An added advantage was that, by nature of the technique, the complete performances were recorded in their entirety on the original looped tape.

==Origin of the term==
The term &quot;Frippertronics&quot; (or &quot;frippertronics&quot;) was coined around May 1977 by poet Joanna Walton, Fripp&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, for a performance they planned to do together at The Kitchen performing arts space.

==The &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot; recordings==
Fripp had first used the technique when Brian Eno introduced him to it in Eno&#x27;s home studio, combining Fripp&#x27;s guitar performance with the two-machine tape delay, on the 21-minute piece &quot;The Heavenly Music Corporation&quot; recorded on 8 September 1972 and released on the Fripp &amp; Eno album &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot; in 1973. A subsequent Fripp &amp; Eno album, &quot;Evening Star&quot;, was released in 1975. These recordings were not purely tape loops however, since some after-the-fact processing, overdubbing, and editing were done.

The delay system was first used in live situations for a short European Fripp &amp; Eno tour in May–June 1975 promoting &quot;Evening Star&quot;, with the 28 May 1975 concert at the Paris Olympia Theatre being bootlegged as &quot;Air Structures&quot; (in 2011 the concert was officially released as a download, along with Eno&#x27;s original backing loops).

After returning from this tour Eno released his own version of the open loop tape system with &quot;Discreet Music&quot; (1975), one side of which features looping. Eno mentions in the liner notes that &quot;here is the long delay echo system with which I have experimented since I became aware of the musical possibilities of tape recorders in 1964.&quot;

==Frippertronics and its types==
Frippertronics was later expanded to different situations. In what he called &quot;Pure Frippertronics&quot;, Fripp created loops in real time without additional editing. Sometimes he rewound the recorded tape, to be played back while improvising a guitar solo on top of it. Fripp used this type of Frippertronics to perform live solo concerts in small, informal venues. It allowed him to be what he referred to as a &quot;small, mobile, intelligent unit&quot;, as opposed to being part of a massive rock concert touring company. One such show was in a room at Faunce House at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, in a venue built to be a tiered classroom. 

Only one and a half albums of Pure Frippertronics were officially produced: Side A of &quot;God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners&quot; in 1980; &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; was the pure Frippertronics side, containing three compositions; &quot;Red Two Scorer&quot;, &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;, and &quot;1983&quot;. He then produced &quot;Let the Power Fall: An Album of Frippertronics&quot; in 1981, which takes up where &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; left off, with works entitled &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;1985&quot;, &quot;1986&quot;, &quot;1987&quot;, &quot;1988&quot; and &quot;1989&quot;. &quot;Marriagemusic&quot; was the B side of a League Of Gentlemen single; it clocks in at over 11 minutes.

There is also a 2-LP bootleg of live Frippertronics entitled &quot;Pleasures In Pieces&quot; recorded at The Kitchen in New York City on 5 February 1978, containing five tracks (in order of appearance; &quot;The Second&quot;, &quot;The First&quot;, &quot;The Third&quot;, &quot;The Fourth&quot;, &quot;The Fifth&quot;, ranging from almost 7 minutes to over 24 minutes. The titles of the pieces are most certainly not given by Fripp. This bootleg has also been issued by persons unknown as a single CD. It is most likely a CD-R recording of the vinyl 2-LP set. Of course &quot;Pleasures In Pieces&quot; was not and is not authorized by Fripp. However, the Sound Warehouse recording was issued by Fripp as an MP3 file through his DGM web page, though he makes clear that the recording is an audience bootleg and was not originally authorized by him.

Fripp also used Frippertronics in more conventional rock recordings, replacing what could be viewed as musical parts normally served by orchestral backing. He referred to this as &quot;Applied Frippertronics&quot;. Several of Fripp&#x27;s albums, as well as albums by Peter Gabriel, David Bowie, Daryl Hall, and The Roches, featured this usage. Side B of &quot;God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners&quot; included what Fripp termed &quot;Discotronics&quot;, mixing Frippertronics and a disco-style rhythm section.

According to Eric Tamm, the first album to feature &quot;proper&quot; Frippertronics was Daryl Hall&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Songs&quot; (recorded 1977; released 1980).

==From Frippertronics to Soundscapes==
In the mid-1990s, Fripp revamped the Frippertronics concept into &quot;Soundscapes&quot;, which dramatically expanded the flexibility of the method by using digital technology (delays and synthesizers). Fripp has released several albums of this type under the title &quot;Music for Quiet Moments&quot; culled from live recordings. He began releasing these in 2007 though some of the source tapes are from earlier than that.

<text>Michael Jerome Tuite (December 27, 1966 – December 6, 2003) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1999 to 2001 under the ring names The Wall and Sgt. A.W.O.L., as well as his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2002 and 2003 as Malice.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1994–1999)===
Born in the Ocean Grove section of Neptune Township, New Jersey, to Nancy and Jerome Tuite he had a sister Barbara Tuite-Hacht, Tuite attended Manalapan High School and broke into the wrestling business in 1994 after learning the ropes under veteran Larry Sharpe at his training school in New Jersey. Tuite trained at the WCW Power Plant before he wrestled full-time as The Wall in WCW. He was also a protégé of Bam Bam Bigelow. Tuite debut on March 17, 1996, as Hellraiser defeating Rocky Shore then he appeared in USA Wrestling facing Bodyguard for Hire which he fought in a no contest. He appeared in USA Wrestling again the next week defeating Rocko Dorsey then on November 15, 1996, Hellraiser defeated Gino Caruso. On November 13, 1998, Hellraiser debut at NWA Wrestling, facing JR Ryder, in a losing effort. Tuite finished up on the independent circuit on December 12, 1998, at the Diamond Dallas Page Benefit Show, defeating JL Superstar.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997–1998)===
On July 12, 1997, Hellraiser made his ECW Debut facing Balls Mahoney in a losing effort. On April 4, 1998, Hellraiser made his debut at NWA New Jersey facing 911, in a no contest. On April 25, 1998, Hellraiser faced 911 again in a losing effort. On October 9, 1998, at ECW, Hellraiser teamed with Tommy Rogers, in a winning effort against The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Big Guido).

===World Championship Wrestling===
====The Wall (1999–2000)====
Tuite debuted in World Championship Wrestling in 1999 as a bodyguard for Berlyn, then later moved to the singles division. The Wall and Berlyn had a feud with Vampiro and Jerry Only of the Misfits. The feud led to WCW Mayhem where Berlyn and Vampiro fought in a chain match, which Berlyn lost after The Wall walked out.

The Wall vanished for a while until returning to Souled Out where he defeated Billy Kidman in a cage match. For a while The Wall had an ongoing feud with Kidman and Vampiro. The Wall took on The Demon at SuperBrawl where The Wall beat The Demon. The Wall then feuded with Bam Bam Bigelow, who was angry after The Wall developed a sadistic streak and attacked younger wrestlers, including David Flair and Crowbar. This led to Uncensored where Wall and Bigelow fought in a match where The Wall put Bigelow through a table. Crowbar and Flair tried to get revenge on The Wall, but he gave Crowbar a chokeslam off a 20-foot-high platform, sending Crowbar through the stage.

In April 2000, Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo restarted WCW and vacated all of the titles. The Wall entered the WCW United States Championship tournament, and at Spring Stampede he faced Scott Steiner. He lost, however, when he accidentally chokeslamed a referee through a table and another referee came and disqualified The Wall. He entered into a short feud with Shane Douglas that led to a tables match between them at The Great American Bash, which Douglas won.

====Misfits in Action (2000–2001)====

The Wall then disappeared again for a while until returning with a new look. Joining the stable The Misfits in Action, a military group that was led by General Hugh G. Rection, Lieutenant Loco, Corporal Cajun, Major Stash and Major Gunns, he was renamed Sgt. A.W.O.L. (occasionally spelled &quot;Sgt. A-Wall&quot;). The group had various stable feuds with 3 Count, The Natural Born Thrillers and Team Canada.

At the start of 2001 The MIA had issues involving Gen. Rection and Lt. Loco, and they led the group to break up. Then Sgt. A.W.O.L. went back to his old character The Wall. The Wall and Hugh Morrus then had a short feud which led into SuperBrawl Revenge where Morrus defeated The Wall. After the feud with Morrus, The Wall appeared sporadically in WCW, and wasn&#x27;t involved in the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

===World Wrestling Federation (2001)===
After WCW was bought out by Vince McMahon, Tuite signed a developmental contract with the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001. He was later given his release so he could deal with personal issues.

===Independent Circuit (2001–2003)===
After being released from the WWF, Tuite would reprise his role as The Wall on the independent circuit. On July 12, 2001, The Wall returned at NWA New Jersey defeating Simon Diamond to win the NWA New Jersey Hardcore Championship. Then on August 9, 2001, The Wall faced Danny Doring, in a winning effort to retain the Hardcore Title. On August 24, 2001, The Wall defeated Nova, to retain the Hardcore Championship.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2003)===
In 2002, Tuite began wrestling in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), performing under the moniker of Malice in 2002. He appeared on the first TNA show, competing in a Gauntlet for the Gold match, lasting to the end until he was defeated by Ken Shamrock. He was a member of James Mitchell&#x27;s Disciples of the New Church and on numerous occasions nearly won the NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship. His last TNA appearance was on November 20, 2002, when he beat Kory Williams. He came back on March 19, 2003, to help Slash and Brian Lee to combat Triple X in an even 3 on 3 battle. However, Slash and Lee were disqualified.

Tuite began wrestling on the independent circuit after leaving TNA, appearing for promotions such as XPW as Snuff, and also held the NWA New Jersey Hardcore Championship. He also won the AAW Heavyweight Championship Tournament in November 2002.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2003)===
In February 2003, Tuite wrestled for All Japan Pro Wrestling as Gigantes, and was a member of Taka Michinoku&#x27;s Roughly Obsess &amp; Destroy stable. Gigantes made his debut on February 10, teaming with Arashi and The Gladiator against Keiji Mutoh, Masanobu Fuchi, and Jimmy Wang Yang in a winning effort. On February 16, Gigantes teamed with John Tenta to challenge Arashi and Nobutaka Araya for the All Asia Tag Team Championship but lost by disqualification. In March, Gigantes entered the Champion Carnival defeating Yoji Anjo in the first round on March 22, but lost in the second round to eventual winner Satoshi Kojima on March 25. On June 8, Gigantes teamed with The Gladiator in a four-man tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, but lost in the semifinals against eventual winners Keiji Mutoh and Arashi. On July 19, Gigantes would have one of the biggest matches of his career as he lost to The Great Muta at the Nippon Budokan. On September 6, Gigantes teamed with Taka to challenge Arashi and Mutoh for the World Tag Team Championship but came up short. From November to December, he teamed with Buchanan in the 2003 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, but finished in 6th place with 6 points. In his final match on December 5, 2003, Tuite teamed with Buchanan and Justin Credible to defeat Nobutaka Araya, Tomoaki Honma and Kazushi Miyamoto in Tokyo.

==Death==
On December 6, 2003, Tuite was found unconscious in his hotel room by All Japan Pro Wrestling management and several wrestlers, including NOSAWA and La Parka. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The cause of death was later identified as a heart attack by the medical examiner assigned to the case. There is no physical, toxicological or other evidence that illicit substances were an immediate or remote cause of death.

<doc id="409837" wikidata="Q331694" url="?curid=409837" title="Mercedes-Benz C-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque&#x27;s line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class has been available with a &quot;4MATIC&quot; four-wheel drive option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007 while the current W206 generation was launched in 2021.

Initially available in sedan and a station wagon configurations, a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) variant followed and was later renamed to Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. It remained in production until 2011 when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.


== Predecessor models ==

=== W201 (1982) ===

The Mercedes-Benz W201 is the internal designation for the Mercedes 190 series sedans, a range of front-engine, rear drive, five passenger, four-door sedans manufactured over a single generation, from 1982 to 1993 as the company&#x27;s first compact class automobile.

Designed by Bruno Sacco, head of styling at Mercedes-Benz from 1975 to 1999, the W201 debuted at the 1982 Paris Motor Show. Manufactured in both Bremen and Sindelfingen, Germany, production reached 1,879,629 over its eleven-year model life.
The W201 introduced a 5-link rear suspension subsequently used in E and C class models, front and rear anti-roll bars, anti-dive and anti-squat geometry—as well as airbags, ABS brakes and seatbelt pretensioners. Its extensive use of light-weight high-strength steel enabled it to withstand a concrete barrier offset crash at 35 mph (56 km/h) without serious passenger injury or cabin deformation.

Mercedes introduced a performance variant, marketed as the 190 E 2.3-16V, at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show.

== First generation (W202; 1993) ==


In May 1993, the first generation W202 C-Class was introduced as a replacement for the 190. The first C-Class (W202) sedan was manufactured in August 1992. The C-Class sedan was the company&#x27;s entry-level model up until 1997 when Mercedes launched the A-Class. Styling themes were carried over from the previous W201 series, but the new series had a smoother and rounder design than the last generation of compact Mercedes, with styling cues from the W124 E-Class (short, high trunk and taller tail lights), W140 S-Class (front end), and R129 SL-Class (headlights).
== Second generation (W203; 2000) ==

The second generation C-Class was introduced in March 2000 and production began in March 1999. The sedan debuted with a range of inline-four and V6 petrol engines and inline-four and -five diesels, later W203&#x27;s received the V6 diesel. Most of the engines were carried over from the W202, but the C320 was exclusive, offering . The diesels now featured common rail direct fuel injection and variable geometry turbochargers. A six-speed manual gearbox was optional on some of the range, With exception to the C320 and C32 AMG. Notably (post 2005), for the first time, the number designations were no longer equivalent to the engine displacement, more specifically in the Mercedes C200 (1.8-litre), C240 (2.6-litre) and C200 CDI (2.2-litre).
== Third generation (W204; 2007) ==


DaimlerChrysler introduced the W204 C-Class on 18 January 2007 and displayed it in the 2007 Geneva Auto Show. Sales started on 31 March 2007 in almost all European countries. The new family had an extended wheelbase and tracks, a stiffer body/shell and a design inspired by the W221 S-Class with some influences from the C219 CLS-Class. The C-Class received a facelift in 2011 for the 2012 model year including new LED taillights, a revised dashboard and instrument cluster layout, and a revised front fascia and headlights. The W204 platform continued into 2015 with the C-Class coupe. The final farewell of the W204, and also the naturally aspirated V8, was in the Edition 507 model. This had increased power, lightweight wheels and the vented hood from the Black Series.
== Fourth generation (W205; 2014) ==

The W205 C-Class was launched at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. The new structure was significantly lighter using aluminium and high-strength steel extensively throughout the body, resulting in a weight decrease. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class 205 chassis spawned four C-Class bodystyles; sedan (W205), wagon (S205), coupe (C205), and cabriolet (A205).

The car was officially unveiled on 16 December 2013. W205 production commenced on 4 February 2014 at the Bremen plant. Production was also undertaken at Mercedes-Benz plants in East London (South Africa), Iracemápolis (Brazil) and Tuscaloosa, Alabama (United States). European sales began in March 2014, while the vehicle went on sale in North America in September 2014.

A mid-life update made its debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, including exterior changes and new engines.
== Fifth generation (W206; 2021) ==

The W206 C-Class was unveiled on 23 February 2021. In China, the C-Class was launched in a long-wheelbase version (V206). For the first time, all W206 C-Class models are equipped with four-cylinder engines coupled with an integrated starter generator (15 kW electric motor) and a 48-volt electrical system.

The C-Class All-Terrain (X206) was released as an off-road focused, crossover-inspired estate model. The model received external body cladding, a 40 mm increase in ride height, 4Matic AWD and additional drive modes.

<doc id="409842" wikidata="Q229507" url="?curid=409842" title="Jayne Mansfield">
<text>Jayne Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer; April 19, 1933 – June 29, 1967) was an American actress and &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate. A sex symbol of the 1950s and early 1960s, Mansfield was known for her numerous publicity stunts and open personal life. Although her film career was short-lived, she had several box-office successes, and won a Theatre World Award and Golden Globe Award, and soon gained the nickname of Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;smartest dumb blonde.&quot;

Mansfield gained popularity after playing the role of fictional actress Rita Marlowe in &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; (1955–1956) on Broadway, which she reprised in the film adaptation of the same name in 1957. Her other film roles include the musical comedy &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956), the drama &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot; (1957), the neo-noir &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (1960), and the sex comedy &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot; (1963); the last established Mansfield as one of the first major American actresses to perform in a nude scene in a post-silent era film.

Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. Mansfield married three times, each marriage ending in divorce, and had five children. She was intimately involved with numerous men, including Robert and John F. Kennedy, her attorney Samuel S. Brody, and Las Vegas entertainer Nelson Sardelli. On June 29, 1967, she died in a traffic collision at the age of 34.

==Early life==
Jayne Mansfield was born Vera Jayne Palmer on April 19, 1933, at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the only child of Herbert William Palmer and Vera Jeffrey (née Palmer) Palmer. She inherited more than $90,000 from her maternal grandfather, Thomas ($ in dollars), and more than $36,000 from her maternal grandmother, Beatrice Mary Palmer, in 1958 ($ in dollars).

Until age six, Mansfield lived in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, where her father was an attorney practicing with future New Jersey governor Robert B. Meyner. In 1936, her father died of a heart attack. In 1939, Jayne Mansfield&#x27;s mother married sales engineer Harry Lawrence Peers and the family moved to Dallas, Texas, where she was known as Vera Jayne Peers. As a child, she wanted to be a Hollywood star like Shirley Temple. At age 12, Palmer took ballroom dance lessons. She graduated from Highland Park High School in 1950. While in high school, she took violin, piano, and viola lessons. She also studied Spanish and German. Palmer received grades in the high Bs in all subjects consistently.

At age 17, she married Paul Mansfield on May 6, 1950. Their daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield, was born six months later, on November 8, 1950. Jayne and her husband enrolled in Southern Methodist University to study acting. In 1951, Jayne moved to Los Angeles and attended a summer semester at UCLA. She entered the Miss California contest but Paul found out and forced her to withdraw from the competition. She then moved to Austin, Texas, with her husband, and studied dramatics at the University of Texas at Austin. There, Mansfield worked as a nude art model, sold books door-to-door, and worked as a receptionist at a dance studio. She also joined the Curtain Club, a campus theatrical society that included lyricist Tom Jones, composer Harvey Schmidt, and actors Rip Torn and Pat Hingle among its members. Mansfield then spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia, while her husband Paul served in the United States Army Reserve during the Korean War.

In 1953, she moved back to Dallas and studied acting for several months under Baruch Lumet, the father of director Sidney Lumet and founder of the Dallas Institute of Performing Arts. Lumet gave Mansfield private lessons and called Mansfield and Rip Torn his &quot;kids&quot;. Eventually, Lumet helped Jayne get her first screen test at Paramount in April 1954. Paul, Jayne, and Jayne Marie moved to Los Angeles in 1954. Jayne worked at a variety of odd jobs including: selling popcorn at the Stanley Warner Theatre, teaching dance, selling candy at a movie theater, modeling part-time at the Blue Book Model Agency, and working as a photographer at Esther Williams&#x27; Trails Restaurant.

== Career ==

===&quot;Playboy&quot;===
While attending the University of Texas at Austin, Mansfield won several beauty contests, including Miss Photoflash, Miss Magnesium Lamp, and Miss Fire Prevention Week. By her own account, the only title she refused was Miss Roquefort Cheese, because she believed it &quot;just didn&#x27;t sound right&quot;. Mansfield later rejected &quot;Miss Prime Rib&quot; in 1957 as well. In 1952, while in Dallas, she and Paul Mansfield participated in small local-theater productions of &quot;The Slaves of Demon Rum&quot; and &quot;Ten Nights in a Barroom&quot;, and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; in Camp Gordon, Georgia. After he left for military service, she made her first significant stage appearance in a production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; on October 22, 1953, with the players of the Knox Street Theater, headed by Lumet. While at UCLA, she entered the Miss California contest (hiding her marital status), and won the local round before withdrawing.

Early in her career, some advertisers considered her prominent breasts undesirable, which led to her losing her first professional assignment – a commercial for General Electric that depicted young women in bathing suits relaxing around a pool. Emmeline Snively, head of the Blue Book Model Agency, had sent her to photographer Gene Lester, which led to her short-lived assignment in the General Electric commercial. In 1954, she auditioned at both Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. At Paramount, Jayne performed a sketch she had worked out with Lumet from &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; for casting director Milton Lewis. Lewis informed her that she was wasting her &quot;obvious talents&quot; and had her come back a week later to perform the piano scene from &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;. Jayne failed to impress but learned she would have to go blonde. She then performed the piano scene for Warner Brothers, but, again, failed to impress. She landed her first acting assignment in &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, a series on CBS in the episode &quot;An Angel Went AWOL&quot;, aired on October 21, 1954. In it, she sat at a piano and delivered a few lines of dialogue for $300 ($ in dollars).

In December 1953, Hugh Hefner began publishing &quot;Playboy&quot;. The magazine became a success, in part, because of early appearances from Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. In February 1955, Mansfield was the &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month, and appeared in the magazine several times. Her February appearance increased the magazine&#x27;s circulation and helped boost Mansfield&#x27;s career. Shortly afterward, she posed for the &quot;Playboy&quot; calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. &quot;Playboy&quot; featured Mansfield each February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.

In August 1956, Paul Mansfield sought custody of his daughter, alleging that Jayne was an unfit mother because she appeared nude in &quot;Playboy&quot;. In 1964, the magazine repeated the 1955 pictorial. &quot;Playboy&quot; reprinted photos from that pictorial issue, with titles such as December 1965&#x27;s &quot;The &quot;Playboy&quot; Portfolio of Sex Stars&quot;, and January 2000s &quot;Centerfolds of the Century&quot;.

===Film===
Mansfield&#x27;s first film part was a supporting role in &quot;Female Jungle&quot;, a low-budget drama completed in ten days. Her part was filmed over a few days, and she was paid $150 ($ in dollars). It was released unofficially in early 1955. In February 1955, James Byron, her manager and publicist, negotiated a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers, who were intrigued by her publicity antics. The contract initially paid her $250 a week ($ in dollars) and landed her two films – one with an insignificant role and another unreleased for two years. She filed for separation from Paul Mansfield that January. Mansfield was given bit parts in &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1955), starring Jack Webb, and &quot;Hell on Frisco Bay&quot; (1955), starring Alan Ladd. She acted in one more movie for Warner Brothers – another small but significant role opposite Edward G. Robinson in the courtroom drama &quot;Illegal&quot; (1955).

Mansfield&#x27;s agent, William Shiffrin, signed her to play fictional film star Rita Marlowe in the Broadway play &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; with Orson Bean and Walter Matthau. The part was offered to her after actress and friend Mamie Van Doren rejected the offer. She accepted the part while working in producer Louis W. Kellman&#x27;s &quot;The Burglar&quot; (1957), director Paul Wendkos&#x27;s film adaptation of David Goodis&#x27; novel, made in film noir style. Mansfield appeared alongside Dan Duryea and Martha Vickers. It was released two years later, when Mansfield&#x27;s fame was at its peak. She was successful in this straight dramatic role, though most of her subsequent film appearances were comedic or capitalized on her sex appeal. It was Kellman&#x27;s first major venture, and he claimed to have &quot;discovered&quot; Mansfield. She was announced for &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; in mid-July 1955 and was dropped by Warner Brothers on July 31.

Twentieth Century-Fox signed Mansfield to a six-year contract on May 3, 1956, in its New York office to mold her as a successor to the increasingly difficult Marilyn Monroe, their resident blonde sex symbol, who had just completed the very difficult &quot;Bus Stop.&quot; Mansfield was still under contract to Broadway and continued playing &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; on stage until September 15, 1956. She undertook her first starring film role as Jerri Jordan in Frank Tashlin&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956). Originally titled &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, it featured a high-profile cast of contemporary rock and roll and R&amp;B artists including Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Fats Domino, The Platters and Little Richard. Released in December 1956, &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; became one of the year&#x27;s biggest successes, both critically and financially, earning more than &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; had three years before.

Soon afterward, Fox started promoting Mansfield as &quot;Marilyn Monroe king-sized&quot;, attempting to coerce Monroe to return to the studio and complete her contract. Mansfield next played a dramatic role in &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot; (1957), an adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel of the same name. With this film, she attempted to move away from her &quot;blonde bombshell&quot; image and establish herself as a serious actress. The film enjoyed moderate box-office success, and Mansfield won a Golden Globe in 1957 for New Star of the Year, beating Carroll Baker and Natalie Wood with her performance as a &quot;wistful derelict&quot;. It was &quot;generally conceded to have been her best acting&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in a fitful career hampered by her flamboyant image, distinctive voice (&quot;a soft-voiced coo punctuated with squeals&quot;), voluptuous figure and limited acting range. Tashlin cast Mansfield in the film version of the Broadway show &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, released in 1957, reprising her role of Rita Marlowe alongside costars Tony Randall and Joan Blondell. Fox launched its new blonde bombshell with a North American tour and a 40-day, 16-country tour of Europe. She attended the premiere of the film (released as &quot;Oh! For a Man&quot; in the UK) in London, and met Queen Elizabeth II.

Mansfield&#x27;s fourth starring role in a Hollywood film was in &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; (also 1957), for which she received prominent billing alongside Cary Grant. However, in the film itself she is little more than comic relief; Grant&#x27;s character relates to a redhead played by fashion model Suzy Parker. The film, described as &quot;vapid&quot; and &quot;ill-advised&quot;, was a critical and box-office flop, and marked one of the last attempts by 20th Century-Fox to publicize Mansfield. The continuing publicity surrounding Mansfield&#x27;s physical appearance failed to sustain her career. Fox gave her a leading role opposite Kenneth More in &quot;The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw&quot; (1958), a western comedy filmed on location in Spain. In the film, Mansfield&#x27;s three songs were dubbed by singer Connie Francis. Fox released the film in the United States in 1959, and it was Mansfield&#x27;s last mainstream film success. Columbia Pictures offered her a part opposite James Stewart and Jack Lemmon in the romantic comedy &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958), but she turned it down because she was pregnant. Fox then attempted to cast Mansfield opposite Paul Newman in &quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag, Boys!&quot; (1958), his ill-fated first attempt at comedy.

With a decreased demand for big-breasted, blonde bombshells and an increasing negative backlash against her excessive publicity, Mansfield became a box-office has-been by the early 1960s, yet she remained a celebrity, still able to attract large crowds outside the United States by way of lucrative and successful nightclub acts.

Mansfield gained no major star role in film roles after 1959. She was unable to fulfill a third of her contract with Fox due to her reported &quot;repeated pregnancies&quot;. Fox stopped viewing her as a major Hollywood star and started loaning her and her likeness out to foreign productions in England and Italy, respectively, until the end of her contract in 1962. Many of her English/Italian films are regarded as obscure and some considered lost.

In 1959, Fox cast her in two independent gangster films shot in the United Kingdom: &quot;The Challenge&quot; and &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;, both released the following year. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; was not released in the United States until 1961 as &quot;Playgirl After Dark&quot;. &quot;The Challenge&quot; was released in 1963 as &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;. In the United States, censors objected to a scene in &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; in which Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appears nearly nude.

When Mansfield returned to Hollywood in mid-1960, 20th Century Fox cast her in &quot;It Happened in Athens&quot; (1962) with Trax Colton, a handsome newcomer Fox was trying to mold into a heartthrob. She received first billing above the title but appeared in only a supporting role. The Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece in the fall of 1960 but was not released until June 1962. It was a box-office failure, and 20th Century Fox dropped Mansfield&#x27;s contract. In 1961, Mansfield signed on for a minor role but above-the-title billing in &quot;The George Raft Story&quot;, released the following year. Starring Ray Danton as Raft, the film showcased Mansfield in a small part as a glamorous film star. Soon after the film&#x27;s release, she returned to European films, appearing in low-budget foreign films such as &quot;Heimweh nach St. Pauli&quot; (1963, Germany), &quot;L&#x27;Amore Primitivo&quot; (1964, Italy), &quot;Panic Button&quot; (1964, Italy) and &quot;Einer frisst den anderen&quot; (1964, Germany).
Tommy Noonan persuaded Mansfield to become the first mainstream American actress to appear nude in a starring role, in the film &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot; (1963). &quot;Playboy&quot; published nude photographs of Mansfield on the set in its June 1963 issue, resulting in obscenity charges against Hugh Hefner in a Chicago court. &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot; was banned in Cleveland, Ohio, but enjoyed box-office success elsewhere. As a result of the film&#x27;s success, Mansfield landed on the Top 10 list of box-office attractions for that year. Soon after her success in &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot;, Mansfield was chosen from many other actresses to replace the recently deceased Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; (1964), a romantic comedy also starring Dean Martin. She turned down the role because of her pregnancy with daughter Mariska Hargitay, and was replaced by Kim Novak. That same year, Mansfield appeared in a pinup book called &quot;Jayne Mansfield for President: the White House or Bust,&quot; which was promoted on billboards; David Attie, a commercial and fine art photographer, took the photographs.

In 1966, Mansfield was cast in &quot;Single Room Furnished&quot;, directed by husband Matt Cimber. The film required Mansfield to portray three different characters, and was her first starring, dramatic role in several years. It was released briefly in 1966, but did not enjoy a full release until 1968, almost a year after her death. After &quot;Single Room Furnished&quot; wrapped, Mansfield was cast opposite Mamie Van Doren and Ferlin Husky in &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot; (1966), a low-budget comedy from Woolner Brothers. It was her first country and western film, and she promoted it through a 29-day tour of major U.S. cities, accompanied by Husky, Don Bowman and other country musicians. Before filming began, Mansfield said she would not &quot;share any screen time with the drive-in&#x27;s answer to Marilyn Monroe&quot;, meaning Van Doren. Though their characters did share one scene, Mansfield and Van Doren filmed their parts at different times to be edited together later.

Mansfield&#x27;s wardrobe relied on the shapeless styles of the 1960s to hide her weight gain after the birth of her fifth child. Despite career setbacks, she remained a highly visible celebrity during the early 1960s through her publicity antics and stage performances. In early 1967, Mansfield filmed her last role, a cameo in &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot;, a comedy starring Walter Matthau, Robert Morse and Inger Stevens. The opening credits listed Mansfield as one of the technical advisers, along with other star names.

===Television===

Mansfield played her first leading role on television in 1956 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. In her first appearance on British television in 1957, she recited from Shakespeare (including a line from &quot;Hamlet&quot;) and played piano and violin. Her notable performances in television dramas included episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; (three episodes), &quot;Kraft Mystery Theater&quot; and &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;. Mansfield&#x27;s performance in her first series &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (&quot;The Dumbest Blonde&quot;; Season 1, Episode 21; February 4, 1962; produced by 20th Century Fox Television) was hailed as the advent of &quot;a new and dramatic Jayne Mansfield&quot;. She appeared on a number of game shows including &quot;Talk it up,&quot; &quot;Down You Go&quot; (as a regular panelist), &quot;The Match Game&quot; (one rare episode has her as a team captain), and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (as a special mystery guest).

She performed in a number of variety shows including &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; (on which she played violin), &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (during the mid-1960s, when the show was the second-highest-rated program in the U.S.). In November 1957, in a special episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; (&quot;Holiday in Las Vegas&quot;), one of her nightclub acts was featured, something quite scandalous for the audience according to the broadcaster. She was a member of the headlining guests for three of &quot;The Bob Hope Special&quot;s. In 1957, she toured United States Pacific Command areas in Hawaii, Okinawa, Guam, Tokyo and Korea with Bob Hope for the United Service Organizations for 13 days appearing as a comedian; and in 1961, toured Newfoundland, Labrador and Baffin Island in Canada for a Christmas special. Her talk show career includes a large number of appearances which she appreciated for the publicity. One of her more notable appearances on a variety show was on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (Season 10, Episode 35; May 26, 1957) right after her success with &quot;Rock Hunter&quot;, where she played violin with a six-person backup band. After the show she exclaimed, &quot;Now I am really national. Momma and Dallas see the Ed Sullivan show!&quot; According to Nielsen, the episode was watched in 13,400,000 homes, reaching a 34% of the total audience and garnering a viewership of almost 30 million.

By 1958, she earned $20,000 per episode for television performances ($ in dollars). In 1964, Mansfield turned down the role of Ginger Grant on the up-and-coming television sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Although her acting roles were becoming marginalized, Mansfield rejected the part as it epitomized the stereotype she wished to rid herself of. The part eventually went to Tina Louise. A widespread rumor that Mansfield had a breast-flashing dress mishap at the 1957 Academy Awards was found baseless by Academy researchers. Ten days before her death, she read &quot;To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time&quot;, a poem by Robert Herrick about early death, on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; – her last television appearance.

As late as the mid-1980s, Mansfield remained one of the biggest television draws. In 1980, &quot;The Jayne Mansfield Story&quot; aired on CBS starring Loni Anderson in the title role and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mickey Hargitay. It was nominated for three Emmy Awards. A+E Networks TV series &quot;Biography&quot; featured her in an episode titled &quot;Jayne Mansfield: Blonde Ambition&quot;. The TV series won an Emmy Award in the outstanding non-fiction TV series category in 2001. A&amp;E again featured her life in another TV serial, &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot;, in 1999. In 1988, her story and archival footage was a part of the TV documentary &quot;Hollywood Sex Symbols&quot;.

== Other ventures ==

===Stage appearances===

Between 1951 and 1953 she acted in &quot;The Slaves of Demon Rum&quot;, &quot;Ten Nights in a Barroom&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. Her performance in an October 1953 production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; attracted Paramount Pictures to audition her. Lumet trained her for the audition. In 1955, she went to New York and appeared in the Broadway production of George Axelrod&#x27;s comedy &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, also featuring Orson Bean and Walter Matthau. It was her first major stage performance, garnering her critical attention which was not always positive. She starred as Rita Marlowe (a wild, blonde Hollywood starlet à la Monroe) in the musical spoofing Hollywood in general and Marilyn Monroe in particular. Her wardrobe, namely a bath-towel, caused a sensation. She received a Theatre World Award (Promising Personality) for her performance in 1956, as well as a Golden Globe Award (New Star of the year, Actress) in 1957. Brooks Atkinson of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the &quot;commendable abandon&quot; of her scantily clad rendition of Rita Marlowe in the play as &quot;a platinum- movie siren with the wavy contours of Marilyn Monroe&quot;. She performed in about 450 shows between 1955 and 1956. At the time, she was considered one of the biggest Broadway-to-Hollywood success stories.

In 1964, she performed in stage productions of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; at Carousel Theater, and &quot;Bus Stop&quot; at Yonkers Playhouse. Both co-starred Mickey Hargitay and were well-reviewed. Mansfield toured small U.S. towns alternating between the two plays. In 1965, she performed in another pair of plays: &quot;Rabbit Habit&quot; at the Latin Quarter nightclub, and &quot;Champagne Complex&quot;, directed by Matt Cimber, at the Pabst Theater. Both plays received poor reviews.

===Nightclub===
In February 1958, the Tropicana Las Vegas launched Mansfield&#x27;s striptease revue &quot;The Tropicana Holiday&quot; (produced by Monte Proser, co-starring Mickey Hargitay) under a four-week contract that was extended to eight. The opening night raised $20,000 for March of Dimes ($ in dollars). She received $25,000 per week for her performance as Trixie Divoon in the show ($ in dollars), while her contract with 20th Century Fox was paying her $2,500 per week ($ in dollars). She had a million-dollar policy with Lloyd&#x27;s of London in case Hargitay dropped her as he whirled her around for the show. In 1959, Jayne returned to the Tropicana and made $30,000 per week, with her show being extended twice. In December 1960, the Dunes hotel and casino launched Mansfield&#x27;s revue &quot;The House of Love&quot; (produced by Jack Cole, co-starring Hargitay). She received a salary of $35,000 a week ($ in dollars) – the highest in her career.

Her wardrobe for the shows at Tropicana and Dunes featured a gold mesh dress with sequins to cover her nipples and pubic region. That controversial sheer dress was referred to as &quot;Jayne Mansfield and a few sequins&quot;. In early 1963, she performed in her first club engagement outside Las Vegas, at the Plantation Supper Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, earning $23,000 in a week ($ in dollars), and then at Iroquois Gardens in Louisville, Kentucky. She returned to Las Vegas in 1966, but her show was staged on Fremont Street, away from the Strip where the Tropicana and Dunes were. Her last nightclub act &quot;French Dressing&quot; was at the Latin Quarter in New York in 1966, also repeated at the Tropicana. It was a modified version of the Tropicana show, and ran for six weeks with fair success.

Her nightclub career became inspirations for films, documentaries, and a musical album. 20th Century Fox Records recorded &quot;The House of Love&quot; for an album entitled &quot;Jayne Mansfield Busts Up Las Vegas&quot; in 1962. She played the roles of burlesque entertainer Midnight Franklin in &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (1960) and Las Vegas show girl Tawni Downs in &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot; (1966). In 1967, an independent documentary &quot;Spree&quot; (alternative title &quot;Las Vegas by Night&quot;) on the antics of Las Vegas entertainers was released. The film, narrated as a part of a travelogue of Vic Damone and Juliet Prowse, featured Mansfield, Hargitay, Constance Moore and Clara Ward as guest stars. Mansfield strips and sings &quot;Promise Her Anything&quot; from the film &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot;. A court order prohibited using any of the guest stars to promote the film.

Later in her career, Mansfield was busier on stage, performing and making appearances with her nightclub acts, club engagements, and performance tours. By 1960, she made personal appearances for everything from supermarket promotions to drug store openings, at $10,000 per appearance ($ in dollars).

=== Musical work ===


Mansfield had classical training in piano and violin. She sang in film soundtracks, on stage for her theatrical and nightclub performances, and had singles and albums released. After her death, Mansfield became an inspiration for punk-rock musicians.

====Soundtracks====

Mansfield sang in English and German for a number of her films, including &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (&quot;Ev&#x27;rytime&quot; and &quot;Rock Around the Rock Pile&quot;), &quot;Illegal&quot; (&quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot;), &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot; (&quot;That Makes It&quot;), &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (&quot;Too Hot To Handle&quot;, &quot;You Were Made For Me&quot;, &quot;Monsoon&quot; and &quot;Midnight&quot;), &quot;Homesick for St. Pauli&quot; (&quot;Wo Ist Der Mann&quot; and &quot;Snicksnack Snuckelchen&quot;), &quot;The Challenge&quot; (&quot;The Challenge of Love&quot;), &quot;The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw&quot; (&quot;Strolling Down The Lane With Billy&quot; and &quot;If The San Francisco Hills Could Only Talk&quot;), and &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, alternative title &quot;Lullaby of Love&quot;).

====Live performances====
In 1958, an orchestra was recorded for the 31st Academy Awards ceremony with Jack Benny on first violin, Mansfield on violin, Dick Powell on trumpet, Robert Mitchum on woodwind, Fred Astaire on drums and Jerry Lewis as conductor; however, the performance was canceled. She sang &quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot; for &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; (&quot;Jack Takes Boat to Hawaii&quot;; Episode 9, Season 14; November 26, 1963). Her club performances regularly featured songs like &quot;Call Me&quot;, &quot;A Little Brains, A Little Talent&quot; (&quot;This Queen has her aces in all the right places&quot;), &quot;Plain Jane&quot;, &quot;Quando-Quando&quot;, &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot;, and the song made famous by Marilyn Monroe – &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;.

====Discography====
In 1962, 20th Century Fox Records released the album &quot;Jayne Mansfield Busts Up Las Vegas&quot;, a recording of her Las Vegas revue &quot;The House of Love&quot;. In 1964 MGM Records released a novelty album called &quot;Jayne Mansfield: Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky &amp; Me&quot;, in which Mansfield recited Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and poems by Marlowe, Browning, Wordsworth, and others against a background of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music. The album cover depicted a bouffant-coiffed Mansfield with lips pursed and breasts barely covered by a fur stole, posing between busts of Tchaikovsky and Shakespeare. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album as a reading of &quot;30-odd poems in a husky, urban, baby voice&quot;. The reviewer went on to remark that &quot;Miss Mansfield is a lady with apparent charms, but reading poetry is not one of them.&quot;

In 1965, Jimi Hendrix played bass and added lead in his session musician days for Mansfield on two songs – &quot;As The Clouds Drift By&quot; and &quot;Suey&quot; – released as a 45-rpm single by London Records in 1966. Ed Chalpin, the record producer, claimed that Mansfield played all the instruments on the singles. According to Hendrix historian Steven Roby (&quot;Black Gold: The Lost Archives Of Jimi Hendrix&quot;, Billboard Books), this collaboration occurred because they shared the same manager. &quot;Wo ist der Mann&quot; sung in German and released by Polydor Records in Austria was much in demand immediately after its release in August 1963. The A-side featured Hans Last&#x27;s &quot;Snicksnack-Snuckelchen&quot;. The Original Sound label released two original songs from the soundtrack of &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot; – &quot;That Makes It&quot; (an answer to The Big Bopper&#x27;s &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot;) on the A-side, and &quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot; on the B-side – in 1964.

==Personal life==
Mansfield had a daughter with her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. She was the mother of three children from her second marriage to actor/bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay, including actress Mariska Hargitay. She also had a son with her third husband, film director Matt Cimber.

Mansfield&#x27;s son Zoltan made news when a lion named Sammy attacked him and bit his neck while he and his mother were visiting the theme park Jungleland USA in Thousand Oaks, California on November 23, 1966. He suffered from severe head trauma, underwent three surgeries at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, California, including a six-hour brain surgery, and contracted meningitis. He recovered, and Mansfield&#x27;s attorney Sam Brody sued the theme park on the family&#x27;s behalf for $1.6 million ($ million in dollars). The negative publicity led to closure of the theme park.

In 1967, film critic and exploitation movie expert Whitney Williams wrote of Mansfield in &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;her personal life out-rivaled any of the roles she played&quot;. Mansfield was allegedly intimately involved with many men, including Claude Terrail (owner of the Paris restaurant Tour d&#x27;Argent), Robert F. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, Brazilian billionaire Jorge Guinle, Las Vegas entertainer Nelson Sardelli, producer Enrico Bomba, and her attorney Samuel S. Brody. She met John F. Kennedy through his brother-in-law Peter Lawford in Palm Springs, California, in 1960, but their alleged affair did not last. Mansfield and Brody were both killed in a car crash.

===Religion===
In August 1963, Mansfield decided to convert to Catholicism. Although she never converted, she did attend Catholic services when she was in Europe, and followed Catholic practices when she was involved with a Catholic partner (including Hargitay, Sardelli and Cimber). In May 1967, her performance at the Mount Brandon Hotel in Tralee, Ireland, was canceled because Catholic clergy condemned it. She wanted to marry Cimber in a Catholic ceremony, but was unable to find a priest who would perform it. While involved with Brody, she also showed interest in Judaism.

In San Francisco for the city&#x27;s 1966 Film Festival, Mansfield and Brody visited the Church of Satan to meet Anton LaVey, the church&#x27;s founder. He awarded Mansfield a medallion and the title &quot;High Priestess of San Francisco&#x27;s Church of Satan.&quot; The media enthusiastically covered the meeting and the events surrounding it, identifying her as a Satanist, and speculating that she was somehow romantically involved with LaVey. That meeting remained a much-publicized and oft-quoted event both of her life and of the history of the Church of Satan. Karla LaVey, Anton LaVey&#x27;s daughter, asserted in a 1992 interview with Joan Rivers that Mansfield was a practicing LaVeyan Satanist and that she had a romantic relationship with Anton LaVey.

=== Marriages ===

====First marriage====
Jayne met Paul Mansfield at a party on Christmas Eve in 1949; she was a popular student at Highland Park High School, and he at Sunset High School in Dallas. On May 6, 1950, they married in Fort Worth, Texas. At the time of their marriage, Jayne was 17 and three months pregnant, while Paul was 20. While most major biographies put the date at May 6, some sources say the marriage was on May 10, 1950. According to biographer Raymond Strait, she had an earlier &quot;secret&quot; marriage on January 28, after which she conceived her first child. On November 8, 1950, Mansfield gave birth to her daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield. Some sources cite Paul Mansfield as the father of her child, others allege that the pregnancy was the result of date rape.

Paul Mansfield hoped the birth of their child would discourage her interest in acting. When it did not, he agreed to move to Los Angeles in late 1954 to help further her career. In 1952, she juggled motherhood and classes at the University of Texas. Early in 1952, Paul was called to the United States Army Reserve for the Korean War. While he served in the army, she spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Her life became easier with Paul&#x27;s army allotment. Returning from the Korean War in 1954, he took a job with a small newspaper in East Los Angeles, California, and lived in a small apartment in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, with Jayne and her pets – a Great Dane, three cats named Sabina, Romulus, and Ophelia, two chihuahuas, a poodle dyed pink, and a rabbit. While in California, she left Jayne Marie with her maternal grandparents and spent the summer semester at UCLA.

After a series of marital rows around Jayne&#x27;s ambitions, infidelity, and animals, they decided to dissolve the marriage. It was a long process. In February 1955, Jayne filed for separate maintenance and in August 1956 Paul filed for custody of their daughter, Jayne Marie. Jayne filed for divorce in California in 1956; Paul filed for divorce in 1957 in Texas citing mental cruelty, and they received their divorce papers on January 8, 1958. After the divorce, she decided to keep &quot;Mansfield&quot; as her professional name. Paul Mansfield remarried, settled into the public relations business and moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, but failed to win custody suits over Jayne Marie or restrain her from traveling abroad with her mother.

Following her 18th birthday, Jayne Marie complained that she had not received her inheritance from the Mansfield estate or heard from her father since her mother&#x27;s death.

====Second marriage====
Mansfield met her second husband, Mickey Hargitay, at the Latin Quarter nightclub in New York City on May 13, 1956, where he was performing as a member of the chorus line in Mae West&#x27;s show. Hargitay was an actor and bodybuilder who had won the Mr. Universe competition in 1955. Mansfield fell for him immediately, which resulted in a squabble with West. In the ensuing row, Mr. California, Chuck Krauser, beat Hargitay up and was arrested and released on a $300 bond ($ in dollars).

After Mansfield returned from her 40-day European tour, Hargitay proposed to her on November 6, 1957, with a $5,000 10-carat diamond ring ($ in dollars). On January 13, 1958 (days after her divorce from Paul was finalized), Mansfield married Hargitay at the Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The unique glass chapel made public and press viewing of the wedding easy. Mansfield wore a sensational pink, skintight wedding gown made of sequins with a flounce of pink tulle (designed by a 20th Century-Fox costume designer), and at the reception she had Hargitay drink pink champagne.

Hargitay made his first film appearance with Mansfield in a bit part in &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;. The couple became a performing team touring in stage shows, where Mansfield&#x27;s leopard-spot bikini became a topic of discussion and newspaper coverage. As a highlight, Hargitay tossed her around his waist and spun her in wide circles as her shows made more headlines. On screen, he was Mansfield&#x27;s male lead in her Italian ventures – &quot;The Loves of Hercules&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Amore Primitivo&quot;, and a major supporting character in &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot;. On stage, he was the male lead in &quot;The Tropicana Holiday&quot;, &quot;The House of Love&quot;, &quot;French Dressing&quot;, and other nightclub acts.

They made personal appearances on television shows such as the &quot;Bob Hope Specials&quot;. Mansfield and Hargitay had a number of business holdings, including the Hargitay Exercise Equipment Company, Jayne Mansfield Productions, and Eastland Savings and Loan. She co-wrote the autobiographical book &quot;Jayne Mansfield&#x27;s Wild, Wild World&quot; with Hargitay. The book also contained 32 pages of black-and-white photographs from the film printed on glossy paper.

In 1962, she had a well-publicized affair with Enrico Bomba, the Italian producer and production manager of her film &quot;Panic Button&quot;. Hargitay accused Bomba of sabotaging their marriage. In 1963, she had another well-publicized relationship with singer Nelson Sardelli, whom she said she planned to marry when her divorce from Mickey Hargitay was finalized. The couple divorced in Juarez, Mexico, in May 1963, where Sardelli accompanied Mansfield in her legal preparations. She had previously filed for divorce on May 4, 1962, but told reporters &quot;I&#x27;m sure we will make it up.&quot; During the acrimonious divorce proceedings, the actress attempted to force a more favorable financial settlement by accusing Hargitay of kidnapping one of her children.

Mansfield discovered that she was pregnant after her divorce. Being an unwed mother would have endangered her career, so she and Hargitay announced that they were still married. Mariska Hargitay was born January 23, 1964, after the actual divorce but before California ruled it valid. Mansfield sued to get the Juarez divorce declared legal after Mariska was born, and the divorce was recognized on August 26, 1964. A court decree in June 1967 made Hargitay the guardian of Mickey, Zoltan, and Mariska, though they continued to live with Mansfield. He married airline stewardess Ellen Siano in 1968, and she accompanied him to New Orleans when he picked up his three children after Mansfield&#x27;s death. Shortly after her funeral, Hargitay sued his former wife&#x27;s estate for more than $275,000 ($ million in dollars) to support the children, as he and his wife Ellen would raise them, but he lost the suit. Mansfield had once told Hargitay on a television talk show that she was sorry for all the trouble that she had given him.

====Third marriage====
Mansfield became involved with Matt Cimber (a.k.a. Matteo Ottaviano, né Thomas Vitale Ottaviano), an Italian-born film director, when he directed her in a stage production of &quot;Bus Stop&quot; in Yonkers, New York, costarring Hargitay. She married him on September 24, 1964, in Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. The couple separated on July 11, 1965, and filed for divorce on July 20, 1966. Cimber managed her career during their marriage, and guided her through a series of increasingly tawdry projects like &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; and &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot;. Mansfield&#x27;s marriage to Cimber began to collapse in the wake of her alcohol abuse, open infidelities, and her disclosure to Cimber that she had been happy only with her former lover, Nelson Sardelli. Work on Mansfield&#x27;s film, &quot;Single Room Furnished&quot; directed by Cimber (1966), was suspended. The couple had one son, Antonio Raphael Ottaviano (a.k.a. Tony Cimber, born October 18, 1965). Cimber and his second wife, dress designer Christy Hilliard Hanak, who he married on December 2, 1967, raised Tony, Mansfield&#x27;s youngest child. Cimber later worked as an announcer for &quot;Married...with Children&quot; and a producer for &quot;Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling&quot;.

At the time, Mansfield had degenerated into alcoholism, drunken brawls, and performing at cheap burlesque shows. In July 1966, she started living with her attorney, Sam Brody, who had frequent drunken brawls with her and mistreated her eldest daughter, Jayne Marie. Sam&#x27;s wife, Beverly Brody, filed for divorce, naming Mansfield the &quot;41st other woman&quot; in Sam&#x27;s life.

Two weeks before her mother&#x27;s death in 1967, 16-year-old Jayne Marie accused Sam Brody of beating her. The girl&#x27;s statement to officers of the Los Angeles Police Department the following morning implicated her mother in encouraging the abuse, and days later a juvenile court judge awarded temporary custody of Jayne Marie to Paul&#x27;s uncle William W. Pigue and his wife Mary.

=== Influence ===

Mansfield was a major Hollywood sex symbol of the 1950s and early 1960s and 20th Century Fox&#x27;s alternative to Marilyn Monroe. She came to be known as the &quot;Working Man&#x27;s Monroe&quot;. She was one of Hollywood&#x27;s original blonde bombshells, and remains one of the most recognizable icons of 1950s celebrity culture.

According to Hollywood historian and biographer James Parish, Mansfield&#x27;s hourglass figure (she claimed dimensions of 40–21–35), unique walk, breathy baby talk, and cleavage-revealing costumes made an enduring impact. Hollywood historian Andrew Nelson said that she was seen as Hollywood&#x27;s gaudiest, boldest, D-cupped, B-grade actress from 1955 until the early 1960s.

Frequent references have been made to Mansfield&#x27;s very high IQ, which she claimed was 163. In addition to English, she spoke four other languages. She learned French, Spanish, and German in high school, and in 1963 she studied Italian. Reputed to be Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;smartest dumb blonde&quot;, she later complained that the public did not care about her brain, saying: &quot;They&#x27;re more interested in 40–21–35&quot;, a reference to her body measurements.

=== Trademarks ===

====Blonde====

A natural brunette, Mansfield had her hair bleached and colored platinum blonde when she moved to Los Angeles, and became one of the early &quot;blonde bombshells&quot;, along with Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Mamie Van Doren. In 1958, she also had her eyebrows dyed platinum. Following Jean Harlow (who started the trend with her film &quot;Bombshell&quot;), Monroe, Mansfield, and Van Doren helped establish the stereotype typified by a combination of curvaceous physique, very light-colored hair, and a perceived lack of intelligence. A review of English-language tabloids shows it to be one of the most persistent blonde stereotypes – along with &quot;busty blonde&quot;, and &quot;blonde babe&quot;.

Mansfield and Monroe have been described as representations of a historical juncture of sexuality in comedy and popular culture. Academics also added Anita Ekberg and Bettie Page to the list of catalysts of the trend of exaggerated female sexuality, along with Mansfield and Monroe. M. Thomas Inge describes Mansfield, Monroe, and Jane Russell as personifications of the bad girl in popular culture. Judy Holliday and Goldie Hawn are also identified to have established the stereotype of the &quot;dumb blonde&quot;, typified by their combination of overt sexuality, and apparent inability to understand everyday life. Instead of the asexualized and virginal &quot;nice girls&quot; of earlier films, the pneumatic blonde bombshells took over the screen in the 1950s to become a cult that has been consistently emulated from that era on. Social historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg described the 1950s as &quot;an era distinguished by its worship of full-breasted women&quot; and attributes the paradigm shift to Mansfield and Monroe. Patricia Vettel-Becker made that observation more specific by attributing the phenomenon to &quot;Playboy&quot; and Mansfield and Monroe&#x27;s appearances in the magazine.

====Anatomy====
Newspapers in the 1950s routinely published Mansfield&#x27;s body measurements, which once led evangelist Billy Graham to exclaim, &quot;This country knows more about Jayne Mansfield&#x27;s statistics than the Second Commandment.&quot;Mansfield proclaimed a 41-inch bust line and a 22-inch waist when she made her Broadway debut in 1955, though some scholars dispute those figures. She was known as &quot;the Cleavage Queen&quot; and &quot;the Queen of Sex and Bosom&quot;.

It was said that her breasts fluctuated&lt;ref name=&quot;thewomens/changes-breasts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta/Breast-Pregnancy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in size from her pregnancies and nursing her five children. Her smallest bust measurement was 40-D (102 cm), which was constant throughout the 1950s, and her largest was 46-DD (117 cm), measured by the press in 1967. According to Playboy, her vital statistics were 40D-21-36 (102–53–91 cm) on her 5&#x27;6&quot; (1.68 m) frame.

It has been claimed that her bosom was a major force behind the development of 1950s brassieres, including the &quot;whirlpool bra&quot;, &quot;cuties&quot;, the &quot;shutter bra&quot;, the &quot;action bra&quot;, latex pads, cleavage-revealing designs, and uplifted outlines. R. L. Rutsky and Bill Osgerby have claimed that it was Mansfield, along with Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot, who made the bikini popular. Drawing on the Freudian concept of fetishism, British science-fiction writer and socio-cultural commentator J. G. Ballard commented that Mae West&#x27;s, Mansfield&#x27;s, and Monroe&#x27;s breasts &quot;loomed across the horizon of popular consciousness&quot;. According to Dave Kehr, as the 1960s approached, the anatomy that had made her a star turned her into a joke. In this decade, the female body ideal shifted to appreciate the slim waif-like features popularized by supermodel Twiggy, actress Audrey Hepburn, and others, demarcating the demise of the busty blonde bombshells.

===Publicity===
Mansfield&#x27;s drive for publicity was one of the strongest in Hollywood. She gave up all privacy, and her doors were always open to photographers. On Christmas Eve 1954, she walked into publicist James Byron&#x27;s office with a gift and asked him to oversee her publicity, which he did, for the most part, until the end of 1961. Byron appointed most of the people on her team – William Shiffrin (press agent), Greg Bautzer (attorney) and Charles Goldring (business manager) – and constantly planted publicity material in the media. She appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her between September 1956 and May 1957.

Because of the successful media blitz, she achieved international renown. On October 10, 1959, she visited White Hart Lane, England, and watched the Tottenham Hotspur versus Wolverhampton Wanderers FC football match. By 1960, Mansfield had topped press polls for more words in print than anyone else in the world, had made more personal appearances than a political candidate, and was regarded as the world&#x27;s most-photographed Hollywood celebrity. She made news on a regular basis, for malfunctioning dresses and clothing that burst strategically at the seams, to wearing low cut dresses without a bra. Things worsened when she took charge of her own publicity without advice. According to her agent William Shiffrin, &quot;She became a freak.&quot; James Bacon wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; in 1973: &quot;Here was a girl with real comedy talent, spectacular figure and looks and yet ridiculed herself out of business by outlandish publicity.&quot;

Mansfield received her first truly negative publicity after she and Hargitay pleaded poverty when his first wife, Mary Hargitay, who he divorced on September 6, 1956, requested additional child support for their nine-year-old, first child, Tina, in September 1958. Mansfield said she slept on the floor of her mansion, was unable to buy furniture, and spent only $71 on her daughter Jayne Marie ($ in dollars). During this marriage she had three children, Miklós Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (born December 21, 1958), Zoltán Anthony Hargitay (born August 1, 1960), and Mariska Magdolna Hargitay (born January 23, 1964).

====Publicity stunts====
In January 1955, Mansfield appeared at a Silver Springs, Florida, press junket promoting the film &quot;Underwater!&quot;, starring Jane Russell. She purposely wore a too-small red bikini, lent to her by photographer friend Peter Gowland. When she dove into the pool for photographers, her top came off, creating a burst of media attention. The ensuing publicity led to Warner Bros. and &quot;Playboy&quot; approaching her with offers. On June 8 of the same year, her dress fell down to her waist twice in a single evening – once at a movie party, and later at a nightclub. In February 1958, she was topless at a Carnival party in Rio de Janeiro. She shimmied out of her polka-dot dress in a Rome nightclub in June 1962. In the three years since making her Broadway debut in &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, Mansfield had become the most controversial star of the decade.

In April 1957, her breasts were the focus of a publicity stunt intended to deflect media attention from Sophia Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star&#x27;s honor. Photographs of them were published around the world. The best-known photo showed Loren&#x27;s gaze falling on the actress&#x27;s cleavage (she was seated between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb) when Mansfield leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline, exposing one of her nipples. The Jayne Mansfield-Sophia Loren photograph was a UPI sensation, appearing in newspapers and magazines with the word &quot;censored&quot; hiding the actress&#x27;s exposed nipple.

At the same time, the world&#x27;s media were quick to condemn Mansfield&#x27;s stunts. One editorial columnist wrote: &quot;We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better; but we get angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses ... use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked.&quot; By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate a great deal of negative publicity because of repeated exposure of her breasts in carefully staged public &quot;wardrobe accidents&quot;. Richard Blackwell, her wardrobe designer (who also designed for Jane Russell, Dorothy Lamour, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan), dropped her from his client list because of this. In April 1967, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;She confuses publicity and notoriety with stardom and celebrity and the result is very distasteful to the public.&quot;

===Signature color===

Mansfield adopted pink as her color in 1954, and was associated with it for the rest of her career. Her original choice was purple, but she thought it too close to lavender, Kim Novak&#x27;s signature color. &quot;It must have been the right decision,&quot; she said, &quot;because I got more column space from pink than Kim Novak ever did from lavender.&quot; In November 1957, shortly before their marriage, using money from an inheritance, Mansfield bought the 40-room Mediterranean-style mansion (formerly owned by Rudy Vallée) at 10100 Sunset Boulevard in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. Mansfield had the house painted pink, with cupids surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink fur in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub, and a fountain spurting pink champagne; she then dubbed it the &quot;Pink Palace&quot;. Hargitay (a plumber and carpenter before taking up bodybuilding) built the pink heart-shaped swimming pool. The year after reconstructing the &quot;Pink Palace&quot; as a &quot;pink landmark&quot;, she began riding in a pink Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible with tailfins, then the only pink Cadillac in Hollywood.

===Rivalry===
Throughout her career, Mansfield was compared by the media to the reigning sex symbol of the period, Marilyn Monroe. 20th Century Fox groomed her, as well as Sheree North, to substitute for Monroe, their resident &quot;blonde bombshell&quot;, while Universal Pictures launched Van Doren as their substitute. The studio launched Mansfield with a grand 40-day tour of England and Europe from September 25 to November 6, 1957. She adopted Monroe&#x27;s vocal mannerisms instead of her original husky voice and Texas accent, performed in two plays that were based on Marilyn Monroe vehicles – &quot;Bus Stop&quot; and &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; – and her role in &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot; was strongly influenced by Monroe&#x27;s character in &quot;Bus Stop&quot;.

Other studios also tried to find their own versions of Monroe. Columbia Pictures tried it with Cleo Moore, Warner Bros. with Carroll Baker, Paramount Pictures with Anita Ekberg, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with Barbara Lang, while Diana Dors was dubbed England&#x27;s answer to Mansfield. Jacqueline Susann wrote, &quot;When one studio has a Marilyn Monroe, every other studio is hiring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren.&quot; The crowd of contenders also included Sheree North, Kim Novak, Joi Lansing, Beverly Michaels, Barbara Nichols and Greta Thyssen, and even two brunettes – Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Russell. Mamie Van Doren, Diana Dors and Kim Novak also acted in productions of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. Even when Mansfield&#x27;s film roles were drying up, she was still considered Monroe&#x27;s primary rival. Mansfield considered Mamie Van Doren her professional nemesis. At one point, Monroe, Mansfield, and Mamie were known as &quot;The Three M&#x27;s&quot;.

==Death==
On June 28, 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an engagement at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After midnight, Mansfield, her attorney and partner Sam Brody (age 40), a driver for the Gus Stevens Supper Club named Ronald B. Harrison (age 19), three of her children (Miklós, age 8, Zoltán, age 6, and Mariska, age 3) and her four Chihuahuas left Biloxi to go to New Orleans, where Mansfield was to appear on WDSU&#x27;s &quot;Midday Show&quot;. At about 2:25 a.m. on June 29, on U.S. Highway 90, west of the Rigolets Bridge, their car crashed while traveling between . It ran into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed down from due to an approaching mosquito insecticide fog-spraying truck which was flashing a red light. The three adults in the front seat and two of the dogs died instantly. The children, asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.

Reports that Mansfield was decapitated are untrue, although she suffered severe head trauma. This urban legend started with the appearance in police photographs of the crashed car with its top virtually sheared off, and what resembled a blonde-haired head tangled in the car&#x27;s smashed windshield. However, Mansfield&#x27;s death certificate, which states her immediate cause of death to be &quot;crushed skull with avulsion of cranium and brain,&quot; rules this out. The identity of the head-like shape has not been definitively determined, but it is debated to have been either a wig that Mansfield was wearing or carrying, the top portion of her real hair and scalp, or &quot;something else entirely.&quot; After her death, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommended requiring an underride guard (a strong bar made of steel tubing) on all tractor-trailers; the trucking industry was slow to adopt this change. In America, the underride guard is sometimes known as a &quot;Mansfield bar.&quot;

Mansfield&#x27;s body was flown from New Orleans to New York and a private funeral took place on July 3 at the chapel of the Pullis Funeral Home in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, officiated by a pastor of the Zion Methodist Church who knew Mansfield since her childhood. Mansfield was buried in Fairview Cemetery next to her father. Mickey Hargitay was the only ex-husband of Mansfield present at the funeral.

In 1968, two wrongful-death lawsuits were filed on behalf of Mansfield and ex-husband Matt Cimber. After a 16-day trial, in 1971, the jury found that Harrison, driver of the car, was negligent, that Rambo, driver of the truck into which Mansfield crashed, was not negligent, and that McLelland, driver of the fog-spraying truck, was negligent but his negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident; a rehearing was denied.

The crashed car was saved by a private collector in Florida, where it became a roadside attraction in the 1970s, then was on display by the Dearly Departed Tours &amp; Artifact Museum until the COVID-19 pandemic, when it went into storage.

===Legacy===
Mansfield left behind five children and a crumbling estate, including the Pink Palace. The 1991 US top 40 single &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; by the group Siouxsie and the Banshees and the L.A. Guns song &quot;The Ballad of Jayne&quot;, are about Mansfield and her untimely death.

Mansfield is known for helping shape the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; stereotype. Contrary to her public persona, Mansfield was quite intelligent, and at one point could speak up to five different languages.

Her daughter Mariska Hargitay became an actress and star of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. She has won several awards for her work on the show, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 2005 and an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2006.

====Estate====
After Mansfield&#x27;s death, Hargitay, Cimber, Vera Peers (Mansfield&#x27;s mother), William Pigue (Jayne Marie&#x27;s legal guardian), and Charles Goldring (Mansfield&#x27;s business manager), as well as Bernard B. Cohen and Jerome Webber (both administrators of the estate) filed unsuccessful suits to gain control of her estate. Mansfield&#x27;s estate was appraised initially at $600,000 ($ million in dollars), including the Pink Palace, estimated at $100,000 ($ in dollars), a sports car sold for $7,000 ($ in dollars), her jewelry, and Sam Brody&#x27;s $185,000 estate left to her in his last will ($ in dollars). In 1971, Beverly Brody sued the Mansfield estate for $325,000 ($ in dollars) worth of presents and jewelry given to Mansfield by Sam Brody; the suit was settled out of court. However, her four eldest children (Jayne Marie, Mickey, Zoltan, and Mariska) went to court in 1977 to find that approximately $500,000 in debt that Mansfield had incurred ($ million in dollars), including $11,000 for lingerie ($ in dollars), $11,600 for plumbing of the heart-shaped swimming pool ($ in dollars), and litigation had left the estate insolvent.

The Pink Palace was sold. Its subsequent owners included Ringo Starr and Engelbert Humperdinck. Cass Elliot is often falsely claimed to have owned the home. In 2002, Humperdinck sold it to developers, and the house was demolished in November of that year. What remained of her estate was subsequently managed by CMG Worldwide, an intellectual property-management company.

<doc id="409843" wikidata="Q1089761" url="?curid=409843" title="Church and Wellesley">
<text>Church and Wellesley is an LGBT-oriented enclave in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is roughly bounded by Gerrard Street to the south, Yonge Street to the west, Charles Street to the north, and Jarvis Street to the east, with the core commercial strip located along Church Street from Wellesley south to Alexander. Though some LGBT-oriented establishments can be found outside this area, the general boundaries of this village have been defined by the Gay Toronto Tourism Guild.

==Overview==
While the neighbourhood is home to the community centre, parks, bars, restaurants, and stores catering to the LGBT community (particularly along Church Street), it is also a historic community with Victorian houses and apartments dating back to the late 19th and early 20th century. Many LGBT people also live in the nearby residential neighbourhoods of The Annex, Cabbagetown, St. James Town, St. Lawrence, Riverdale and the Garden District, and in smaller numbers throughout the city and its suburbs.

Church and Wellesley is home to the annual Pride Toronto celebrations, the largest event of its kind in Canada with over 90 floats and an enthusiastic crowd that numbers in the hundreds of thousands. The main Pride Toronto festival and parade is always on the last weekend in June, although a program of Pride-related events is held throughout the month of June. The Pride Parade takes place on Sunday and runs southward along Yonge Street. The Dyke March is a dyke and lesbian grassroots march that runs on the Saturday afternoon and typically ends in Allan Gardens for a community fair and Dyke Stage entertainment. The trans march and fair open up the weekend, with the trans march taking place the Friday evening. There is also a weekend-long community fair that closes off Wellesley between Yonge and Church and stretches down Church Street to Dundas. The community fair includes tables from a wide variety of groups involved in or associated with queer culture and services.

The 519 Church Street Community Centre is the meeting place for numerous social and political groups and became well known as an LGBT-friendly space. &quot;The 519&quot;, as it is most often called, is a city-run community centre that has been adopted locally as the queer community centre, though its programming is not exclusive to LGBT groups and organizations. In 2007, a new wing was opened, and upgrades to the existing spaces were completed in 2009.

Church and Wellesley is also home to the AIDS Memorial, located in Barbara Hall Park, where the names of members of the community who have been lost to AIDS are etched into bronze plaques. A memorial candlelight vigil is held each year at the AIDS Memorial, during Pride Week.

Buddies in Bad Times is a theatre within the enclave dedicated to &quot;the promotion of queer theatrical expression.&quot;

===Alternate names===

A number of alternative names for Church and Wellesley exist in local vernacular, including the Gay Ghetto, the Village, the Gaybourhood or the Gay Village — however, many of these &quot;nicknames&quot; are generic to gay villages across the English speaking world, and are therefore not descriptive of Church and Wellesley specifically, but of gay villages in general. Most people refer to it simply as Church Street or the Village, since most of the LGBT-related establishments in the area are located on that street.

===Bar scene===
Bars in the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood include Woody&#x27;s, Pegasus On Church, Crews &amp; Tangos, the Churchmouse, O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s, Statler&#x27;s, Black Eagle, Boutique, The Well, Flash, and Glad Day.

===Business association===
The Church Wellesley Village Business Improvement Area was established October 2002.

In the summer of 2004, the business association launched a pilot project. Every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. throughout the summer, two blocks of Church Street, from Wellesley south to Alexander, were closed to traffic to encourage more pedestrian activity. However, this proved controversial when some business owners accused other businesses of &quot;stealing&quot; customers by providing street entertainment, and ended three weeks earlier than planned due to a lack of money.

The business association also sponsored the Church Street Fetish Fair in August. In 2003, San Francisco&#x27;s Folsom Street Fair had licensed a consortium of Toronto community groups to use the name &quot;Folsom Fair North&quot; for a similar fetish fair. That fair was held in a large parking lot near the corner of Wellesley and Yonge in 2003 and 2004, and in Allan Gardens in 2005, and the &quot;Church Street Fetish Fair&quot; was widely perceived as retaliation for the Folsom fair not being held on Church Street itself. Folsom Fair North, which changed its name to FFN in 2006, was last held in 2007.

==History==
The portion of the neighbourhood bounded by Yonge, Jarvis, Maitland and Carlton Streets was once the estate of Alexander Wood, a merchant and magistrate in Upper Canada who was at the centre of a strange, supposedly sexually related scandal in 1810. His lands were derisively known as &quot;Molly Wood&#x27;s Bush&quot; in the early nineteenth century — &quot;molly&quot; being a pejorative term for an effeminate or gay man. In the spring of 2005, a statue of Wood was erected at the corner of Church and Alexander Streets (the latter named for Wood), honouring him as a forefather of Toronto&#x27;s modern gay community.
Church Street and the area around it has been familiar to the Toronto gay community for many decades. Prior to the 1970s there had been an underground (mostly male) gay scene centred on various bathhouses and bars around the city that were not exclusively gay establishments but were known to be frequented by homosexuals. Allan Gardens, just east of Church Street on Carlton, was a well-known cruising area for gay men.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the focus of Toronto&#x27;s gay subculture was the Yonge and Wellesley area. The most notable bars for the gay subculture were the Parkside Tavern and the St. Charles Tavern on Yonge Street (one block west of Church) just south of Wellesley. During the 1970s, the St. Charles in particular was the focus of many attacks by homophobes, especially on Halloween when the tavern held an annual drag contest that had been proceeded by an outdoor promenade until attacks by homophobes hurling eggs and rotten fruit made that impossible. The Glad Day Bookshop, for many years the city&#x27;s only gay oriented bookstore, opened on Yonge Street near Wellesley in the mid-1970s. There were also a number of gay-oriented businesses and clubs on the side streets running west off of Yonge street around Wellesley, in particular St. Nicholas Street, a laneway running behind the west side of Yonge, and St. Joseph Street, one block north of Wellesley running west off Yonge. The streets and alleys between Yonge and Bay also became a cruising area frequented by male prostitutes and their clients referred to by the police as &quot;Track two&quot;.

Church Street, one block east of Yonge, had been a depressed area with low rents and started to become a predominantly gay area as gay owned bars and other businesses started opening up as an alternative to the straight owned Parkside and St. Charles Taverns whose owners were accused of being hostile of their gay clientele.

The centre of the gay life in Toronto shifted to Church Street following the 1981 Toronto bathhouse raids, an event that galvanized the gay and lesbian community in the city. George Hislop, a gay businessman and co-owner of one of the raided bathhouses, ran for Toronto City Council with his campaign headquarters located at Church and Wellesley.

In the 1980s, the 519 Church Street Community Centre became the meeting place for numerous social and political groups and became well known as an LGBT friendly space. A strip of gay bars opened along the street and many LGBT people rented apartments, joined residential co-ops or bought condos close to Church. The area became known as a friendly environment where people could be open about their sexual orientation.

===Uncertain future===
As times have changed and Toronto public has become more open to homosexuality, the role of Church and Wellesley as a &quot;sanctuary&quot; for LGBT people has been debated in recent years. Many bars and clubs throughout Toronto are now gay-friendly; establishments such as Wayla, the Drake Hotel, the Gladstone Hotel and the Beaver, although outside Toronto&#x27;s traditional gay village and not technically gay bars &quot;per se&quot;, are popular destinations for young gay and lesbian club-goers.

Rental rates for both commercial and residential property have also risen significantly. In the 2000s, many privately owned businesses, including This Ain&#x27;t the Rosedale Library, have been forced to close down or move to other areas due to these rent increases, and much larger corporations, such as Starbucks, The Body Shop, David&#x27;s Tea, Subway and the Bank of Montreal, have settled on the street in their place. The Priape chain of gay porn and clothing stores closed its Church Street and other locations in October 2013 when it filed for bankruptcy; as of June 2019, its former location is still vacant. Many smaller gay-owned businesses have moved to cheaper areas such as Cabbagetown, located east of Church and Wellesley. 

The residents of the area are now largely middle-aged men with established careers, as the high rents and increasing density of condominium development mean that the majority of gay youth cannot afford to live in the neighbourhood. Some choose to settle in nearby neighbourhoods such as St. James Town and Cabbagetown, while others no longer feel it necessary to live near the village as they can be open about their sexuality without as much fear of backlash. Many in the gay community have expressed concern about the decline of the neighbourhood&#x27;s appeal with youth and its loss of small businesses. Other downtown neighbourhoods much farther afield from Church and Wellesley, including Parkdale, Trinity-Bellwoods, Riverdale and Leslieville, are also now popular areas for LGBT residents; Parkdale in particular has even earned the nickname of &quot;Queer West Village&quot; in recent years.

In 2013, a partnership of community organizations, including The 519 and the Church-Wellesley Business Improvement Association, launched a community survey to solicit ideas for community revitalization. Questions posed by the study included &quot;What is the role of an &#x27;LGBTQ village&#x27; in a modern, progressive city?&quot; and &quot;What must be done to support the Church-Wellesley Village to solidify its role as a major cultural community hub in the Toronto context now and into the future?&quot;

==Politics==
===Federal===
The neighbourhood is part of the federal electoral district of Toronto Centre, currently represented in the House of Commons by Marci Ien of the Liberal Party of Canada. Previous representatives have included Bill Morneau, Bob Rae, Chrystia Freeland, and Bill Graham.

In the 2012 electoral redistribution proposals at the federal level, the neighbourhood was proposed for division, with Wellesley Street serving as the new boundary between Toronto Centre to the south and a new district of Mount Pleasant to the north. Due to community opposition, in the final report the northern boundary of Toronto Centre was shifted north to Charles Street.

===Provincial===
As early as 1977, politicians and journalists were already identifying the riding of St. George, the electoral district which included the Church and Wellesley village at that time, as perhaps the only electoral district in North America outside San Francisco where the support of gay voters could almost singlehandedly determine the winner. That district&#x27;s MPPs in the 1970s and 1980s, Margaret Campbell (1973–1981) and Susan Fish (1981–1987), were both among the province&#x27;s most vocal supporters of LGBT rights initiatives in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario during their terms in office. Despite this, the parties remained reluctant to actually nominate an openly gay candidate, for fear of backlash against the parties in other parts of the province – in 1981, the Ontario Liberal Party rejected the candidacy of Peter Maloney and the Ontario New Democratic Party rejected the candidacy of John Argue, with Maloney claiming that party insiders had dismissed him as a &quot;single-issue candidate&quot;.

When St. George was redistributed into St. George—St. David for the 1987 election, Ian Scott defeated Fish for the seat. Scott was not openly gay during his time in the legislature, although his sexuality was something of an open secret, and he came out after his retirement from politics. When Tim Murphy won the seat in a 1993 by-election after Scott&#x27;s resignation from the legislature, one of his first significant legislative initiatives as an MPP was the presentation of a private member&#x27;s bill which would have expanded the rights of same-sex couples, although it was later superseded by the Rae government&#x27;s failed Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act.

For the 1999 election, St. George—St. David was redistributed into the current district of Toronto Centre. George Smitherman, the first openly gay MPP elected to the provincial legislature in Ontario, represented the district from 1999 to 2010. After his resignation from the legislature to run for Mayor of Toronto in the 2010 mayoral election, he was succeeded by the openly gay Glen Murray. Murray resigned his seat effective 1 September 2017 to accept a position with the Pembina Institute, and the seat remained vacant until the 2018 provincial election. Suze Morrison was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario to represent Toronto Centre in the 2018 provincial election. In 2021 Morrison came out as bisexual.

Kristyn Wong-Tam, formerly the area&#x27;s representative to Toronto City Council, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 2022.

===Municipal===
In 1991, Kyle Rae was elected to Toronto City Council to represent the ward that includes Church and Wellesley, becoming the city&#x27;s first out gay councillor. He represented the area until 2010, when he retired and was succeeded by Kristyn Wong-Tam, the city&#x27;s first out lesbian councillor.

Since the 2022 Toronto municipal election, the neighbourhood is represented by Chris Moise.

==Demographics==

In 2006, the non-immigrant population accounted for 58% of the census tract population. The immigrant population was 35% and the non-permanent residents 7%. In 2011, the non-immigrant population still accounted for 58% but the non-permanent residents population rose from 7 to 10%, leaving the immigrant population at 32%.

==In popular culture==
The television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, a Canadian-American coproduction, was filmed in the Church and Wellesley area. Although considerable outdoor filming took place and the neighbourhood was quite recognizable within the show, the series was set in Pittsburgh rather than Toronto.

The Toronto-based comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall performed a recurring sketch, &quot;The Steps&quot;, on their television series in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Although the sketch was filmed on a studio set, it was inspired by a real cultural touchstone in the Church and Wellesley area, a series of steps along the length of a building on the southwest corner of Church and Wellesley where residents of and visitors to the neighbourhood regularly congregated to hang out.

In 2020, CBC Gem premiered the web series &quot;Queens&quot;, a comedic mystery set in the neighbourhood and starring several real life Toronto drag queens.

<text>Spiral arms are a defining feature of spiral galaxies. They manifest as spiral-shaped regions of enhanced brightness within the galactic disc. Typically, spiral galaxies exhibit two or more spiral arms. The collective configuration of these arms is referred to as the spiral pattern or spiral structure of the galaxy.

The appearance of spiral sleeves is quite diverse. Grand design spiral galaxies exhibit a symmetrical and distinct pattern, comprising two spiral arms that extend throughout the galaxy. In contrast, the spiral structure of flocculent galaxies comprises numerous small fragments of arms that are not connected to each other. The appearance of spiral arms varies across the electromagnetic spectrum.

In addition to increased brightness, spiral arms are characterised by an increased concentration of interstellar gas and dust, bright stars and star clusters, active starburst, a bluer colour, and an enhanced magnetic field strength in galaxies. The contribution of spiral arms to the total galaxy luminosity can reach 40–50% for some galaxies. The characteristics of spiral arms are correlated with other properties of galaxies, for example, the twist angle of spiral arms is related to parameters such as the mass of the supermassive black hole at the centre and the contribution of the bulge to the total luminosity.

Two main theories have been proposed to explain the origin of spiral arms: the stochastic self-propagating star formation model and the density wave theory. These theories describe different variants of the spiral structure and do not exclude each other. In addition to these theories, there are other theories that can explain the appearance of spiral structure in some cases.

The spiral structure was first identified in 1850 by Lord Rosse in the galaxy M51. The nature of spiral structure in galaxies remained unresolved for a considerable period of time.

== General characteristics ==

Spiral arms are a defining feature of the structural composition of spiral galaxies, which are situated within discs and exhibit heightened brightness relative to their surrounding environment. Such structures take the form of spirals, which in unbarred galaxies usually originate from a region near the centre of the galaxy, whereas in barred galaxies they originate at the ends of the bar. The spiral arms do not extend over the entire radius of the disc and cease at the distance at which the disc can still be discerned. A galaxy typically comprises two or more spiral arms. The collective configuration of these arms within a galaxy is referred to as a spiral pattern or spiral structure.

Around two thirds of all massive galaxies are spiral galaxies. Spiral arms have been observed in galaxies at redshifts up to formula_1, and on occasion even at greater distances, which corresponds to a time when the age of the Universe was less than half of the present one. This suggests that the spiral structure is a long-lived phenomenon.

The spiral arms exhibit considerable variation in their appearance. In general, they are characterized by an increased concentration of gas and dust, active starburst, and a greater prevalence of star clusters, H II regions, and bright stars than in the remainder of the disk. While spiral arms are primarily identifiable due to their young stellar population, there also exists an increased concentration of old stars within them.

The appearance and expression of spiral branches in a galaxy may vary depending on the part of the electromagnetic spectrum in which it is observed. In the blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum, the spiral arms are well defined due to the presence of blue supergiants. In the red and near-infrared, older stars contribute more, which makes the spiral arms appear smoother, but less contrasted. Radiation from interstellar dust makes the spiral arms bright in the far infrared, while radiation from neutral hydrogen and molecules makes them bright at radio band. The greatest contrast and amount of fine detail in spiral arms can be seen when observed in emission spectral lines produced by emission nebulae, as well as in polyaromatic hydrocarbon lines produced by cold gas clouds.

The appearance of spiral arms is one of the criteria for galaxy morphological classification. For example, in Hubble&#x27;s classification scheme, spiral galaxies are divided into types Sa, Sb, Sc. Barred spiral galaxies are divided into types SBa, SBb and SBc. The spiral arms of early type Sa and SBa galaxies are tightly wound and smooth, while those of late type Sc and SBc galaxies are knotty and loosely wound. Types Sb and SBb exhibit intermediate characteristics.&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed&quot; widths=&quot;370&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; caption=&quot;Spiral galaxies of different morphological types in the SDSS&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Morphology ===
The spiral structure of galaxies exhibits considerable diversity in appearance. Grand design spiral galaxies exhibit a symmetrical and clear pattern comprising two spiral arms that extend throughout the galaxy. They account for 10% of the total number of spiral galaxies. In contrast, the spiral structure of flocculent galaxies consists of numerous small fragments of arms that are not connected to each other. Among spiral galaxies, the fraction of such galaxies is equal to 30%.

The remainder of the galaxies are of an intermediate type, referred to as &quot;multi-armed&quot;, which exhibit the proberties of both the flocculent and grand design galaxies. For example, they may appear to be grand design galaxies, yet possess more than two arms. Alternatively, they may exhibit a more ordered two-arm structure in the interior, which becomes irregular at the periphery. Nevertheless, in almost all cases, both types of structure are present in the spiral structure. Even grand design galaxies have details that do not fit into the spiral pattern. Additionally, there are galaxies that exhibit different types of spiral structure when observed across different spectral ranges. The distinction between the two main types of spiral arms appears to be related to fundamental physical differences between them.&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed&quot; widths=&quot;370&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; caption=&quot;Galaxies with different spiral structure morphology&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;Additionally, spiral arms are subdivided into two categories: massive and filamentary. In the first instance, the spiral arms are wide, diffuse, and do not contrast significantly with the space between them. In contrast, in the second instance, the spiral arms are narrow and clearly defined.&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed&quot; widths=&quot;370&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; caption=&quot;Galaxies with different spiral structure morphology&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Shape and pitch angle ===

The shape of the arm is usually parameterised by the pitch angle formula_2. The pitch angle is the angle between the tangent to spiral arm at a given point and the perpendicular to the radius drawn to that point. In the majority of spiral galaxies, the average pitch angle lies within the range of 5° to 30°. Spiral arms with a small pitch angle are called tightly wound, while those with a larger pitch angle are called open.

The shape of spiral arms is often described in a simplified manner as a logarithmic spiral. However, spiral arms may also be described as an Archimedean or hyperbolic spiral. In the case of the logarithmic spiral, the pitch angle is constant. It decreases with increasing distance from the centre in the Archimedean spiral and increases in the hyperbolic spiral. The measurements of twist angles in galaxies indicate that only a minority of spiral galaxies have pitch angles of the arms that are close to constant. More than two-thirds of galaxies have pitch angles that vary by more than 20%. The average twist angle is found to correlate with a number of different galaxy parameters. For example, the spiral arms of galaxies with brighter bulges tend to be wound tighter.

Spiral arms may additionally be categorized as either trailing or leading. In the case of trailing spiral arms, their outer tips point in the direction opposite to the direction of galaxy rotation. In the case of leading arms, their outer tips point in the same direction in which the galaxy rotates. In practice, it is challenging to ascertain whether the arms of a given galaxy are leading or trailing. To observe the spiral structure, the galaxy should not be tilted excessively towards the picture plane. However, a slight tilt is necessary to determine the direction of rotation. Additionally, the side of the galaxy closer to the observer needs to be identified. A review of the observational data indicates that the majority of galaxies exhibit trailing spiral arms, with leading arms being relatively uncommon. For instance, among the two hundred galaxies studied in this manner, only two may have leading arms. In some instances, galaxies exhibit both leading and trailing spiral arms, as exemplified by NGC 4622. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that leading spiral arms can emerge in specific circumstances. One such instance is when the dark matter halo rotates in opposition to the galaxy disk.

The width of spiral arms in the majority of galaxies increases with increasing distance from the centre. Grand design galaxies exhibit the greatest width of spiral arms.

=== Luminosity and colour ===

The ratio of the luminosity of the spiral structure to the luminosity of the entire galaxy is greatest for grand design spiral galaxies. For these galaxies, this ratio is 21% on average, with some reaching as high as 40–50%. For flocculent and multi-arm galaxies, the ratio is 13% and 14%, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of spiral arms in the total luminosity increases in later morphological types. For Sa-type galaxies, this proportion averages 13%, while for Sc-type galaxies it averages 30%.

The colour of the spiral arms becomes increasingly blue for galaxies of late morphological types. The colour index g-r for Sc-type galaxies is approximately 0.3–0.4m, while for Sa-type galaxies it is 0.5–0.6m.

Additionally, there are anemic galaxies (anemic spirals). These galaxies are distinguished by a diffuse, faint spiral pattern, which is attributed to a reduced quantity of gas and, consequently, a diminished star formation rate in comparison to normal spiral galaxies of the same morphological type. Anemic galaxies are more prevalent in galaxy clusters. Apparently, the galaxies in these clusters are subject to ram pressure, which results in the rapid loss of gas. It is hypothesized that this type of galaxy may be in-between spiral and lenticular galaxies.

=== Magnetic field ===
Stronger magnetic fields are observed in the spiral arms than in the remainder of the galaxy. The average value of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies is 10 microgauss, while in their spiral arms it is 25 microgauss. In galaxies with a pronounced spiral pattern, the magnetic fields are orientated along the arms. However, in some cases, the magnetic field may form a separate spiral structure that runs in the space between the visible spiral arms. Conversely, magnetic fields can influence the movement of gas within the galaxy and contribute to the formation of spiral arms. However, they are insufficiently strong to play a dominant role in the formation of spiral arms.

=== Correlation between spiral arm parameters and other galaxy properties ===
The parameters of spiral arms correlate with other galaxy properties. For instance, it is established that galaxies with a greater pitch angle typically exhibit a lower mass of the supermassive black hole at their centre and a smaller galaxy mass in general. Additionally, their bulge contributes less to the total luminosity, they have a lower velocity dispersion in the centre, and their rotation curves appear to be more increasing. However, these dependencies are not particularly pronounced. Although the pitch angle of the spiral arms was originally introduced into the galaxy morphological classification as one of the classification criteria, subsequent analysis has revealed that this value correlates with the morphological type to a lesser extent than, for example, the indicator of the colour of the spiral arms. The correlation between the pitch angle and the aforementioned parameters can be theoretically explained. The described quantities are related to the mass distribution within the galaxy, which affects the manner in which the density wave propagates within the galaxy disc.

In more massive galaxies with a more ordered structure, spiral arms are observed to be more pronounced and contrasting. Additionally, the contrast between spiral arms is more pronounced in galaxies with a pronounced bar, although this correlation is relatively weak. In general, flocculent galaxies have a lower mass and a later morphological type than grand design galaxies.

== Spiral structure of the Milky Way ==

It is challenging to ascertain the presence of spiral arms in the disc of our galaxy through optical observation, given that the Sun is situated within the plane of the Milky Way disc, and the light is being absorbed by interstellar dust. Nevertheless, spiral arms can be observed, for instance, when mapping the distribution of neutral hydrogen or molecular clouds.

The precise location, length, and number of spiral arms remain uncertain. However, the prevailing view is that the Milky Way contains four major spiral arms: two main ones – the Scutum–Centaurus and Perseus arms, and two secondary ones – the Norma and Sagittarius arms. Their pitch angle is approximately 12°, and their width is estimated at 800 parsecs. In addition to the large arms, smaller, similar formations, such as the Orion arm, are also distinguished.

== Theories on the spiral structure origin ==
The prevalence of spiral galaxies indicates that spiral structure is a long-lived phenomenon. However, since galaxies themselves rotate differentially rather than as solid bodies, any structure in the disc should curve significantly and disappear in approximately one to two revolutions. The two most prevalent solutions to this issue are the stochastic self-propagating star formation model (SSPSF) and the density wave theory, which describe disparate variants of the spiral structure. The first explanation posits that spiral arms are perpetually forming and dissipating without sufficient time to undergo significant twisting – such spiral arms are designated as material arms. The density wave theory posits that the spiral pattern is a density wave, thereby rotating independently of the disc as a solid body. Consequently, spiral arms are designated as wave arms. It is possible for these types of spiral arms to occur simultaneously within the same galaxy.

Tidal tails observed in interacting galaxies are also considered material spiral arms. Due to the low velocity of matter at a distance from the galaxy, tidal tails appear to persist for an extended period of time.

=== SSPSF model ===
The SSPSF model posits that spiral arms emerge when starburst becomes active within a region of the galaxy. The presence of young, bright stars in this region has the effect of influencing the surrounding interstellar medium. For instance, a supernova explosion generates a shockwave in the gas, thereby facilitating the spread of star formation across the galactic disk. In a period of less than 100 million years, the brightest stars in this region have time to extinguish. This is less than the time required for one revolution of the galaxy. The differential rotation of this region allows it to stretch into a short arc. Given that starburst is a continuous process occurring in different regions of the disc, there are numerous such arcs at different times throughout the disc, which can be observed as a flocculent spiral pattern. Given that such spiral arms are only visible due to young stars, they have a minimal impact on the mass distribution within the galaxy and are rarely observed in the infrared.

=== Density wave theory ===
In the context of density wave theory, spiral arms are understood to emerge when mechanical oscillations occur within a disc, giving rise to a density wave – the stars move within the disc in such a way that they converge in specific regions and become more concentrated. The density wave exerts a governing influence not only on the stars but also on the gas, thereby promoting a more active starburst in regions where the concentration of stars is higher. Concurrently, at various points in time, different stars emerge within the spiral arm, resulting in the density wave moving at a different speed than the stellar disc. Consequently, the density wave is not subject to twisting. The influence of this mechanism results in the formation of a large-scale, ordered spiral structure, which is also observed in the infrared. The concentration of stars in the spiral arm increases by a mere 10–20%, yet this relatively modest change in gravitational potential has a profound impact on the gas dynamics. The gas accelerates, and shock waves can occur in it, appearing as dark dust lanes in the arms.

It is challenging to confirm the presence of a density wave in practice. However, it is possible to do so, for instance, by detecting a specific corotation radius, which is a region where the spiral arm moves at the same speed as the stars. It can be identified by observing colour gradients within the arms. Since the stellar population forms within an arm and subsequently reddens over time, a colour gradient should be observed across the arm if its velocity differs from that of the arm. It is hypothesised that density waves are created and maintained by the bars of galaxies or by tidal force of their satellites.

The density wave theory postulates that only trailing spiral arms are stable, and that any leading structure must at some point transition into a trailing one. Concurrently, the structure itself is amplified for a period following the transformation, which is called swing amplification.

=== Alternative theories ===
Some theories propose alternative mechanisms for the appearance of spiral arms that differ from the density wave theory and the SSPSF model. These theories are not intended to replace the aforementioned theories entirely, but rather to explain the appearance of spiral arms in specific cases. For instance, the manifold theory is applicable only to barred spiral galaxies. According to this theory, the gravitational influence of the bar causes the orbits of the stars to be arranged in a certain way, creating spiral arms and moving along them. The name of the theory is related to the fact that in this model the stars moving in spiral arms form a manifold in phase space. In contrast to the density wave theory, the manifold theory does not posit the emergence of colour gradients in spiral arms, which are in fact observed in numerous galaxies. The fact that in galaxies with a bar, spiral arms originate from a region proximate to the bar may suggest a correlation between these structures and the manifold theory. However, this is not the sole theory that explains the genesis of arms due to bars.

== Research history ==

The spiral arms were first discovered in the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51), in which Lord Rosse identified the spiral structure in 1850.

In 1896, the problem of twisting was formulated. If spiral arms were material entities, due to differential rotation, they would twist very rapidly to the point where they would be impossible to observe. Consequently, the question of the nature of the spiral structure remained unresolved for a considerable period of time. Since 1927, this question has been addressed by Bertil Lindblad, who in 1961 correctly concluded that the spiral arms arise due to gravitational interaction between the stars in the disc. Subsequently, in 1964, Chia-Chiao Lin and Frank Shu proposed the theory that spiral arms can be conceptualised as density waves. The SSPSF model was first proposed in 1978, although the concept of a supernova explosion stimulating starburst in neighbouring regions was first proposed by Ernst Opik as early as 1953. This observation formed the basis of the subsequent theory.

In 1953, the distances to the various stellar associations in our galaxy were measured with a high degree of accuracy. This enabled the discovery of a spiral structure in the Milky Way.

The classification of galaxies into flocculent, multi-armed, and grand design categories is derived from a more complex morphological classification scheme involving 10 classes that describe the type of spiral pattern. The classification scheme was developed by Debra and Bruce Elmegreen in 1987. Subsequently, they proposed a simplified scheme, which is the one that is currently in use.

Despite the considerable successes of the density wave theory, the physical nature of spiral arms remains a topic of debate, with no clear consensus yet reached.

<text>Fox Soccer (formerly Fox Soccer Channel &amp; Fox Sports World before that) was an American television specialty channel specializing in soccer, owned by 21st Century Fox, which operated from 1997 to 2013. It formerly broadcast rugby and Australian rules football, but in its final years it was devoted strictly to soccer.

Due to Fox consolidating its cable sports rights on the new general-interest channels Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, and following the loss of United States television rights to broadcast Premier League soccer events to NBC, Fox Soccer was replaced on September 2, 2013, by FXX, an entertainment sister network to FX. The vast majority of the remaining sports programming from Fox Soccer has been moved to Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, which launched on August 17, 2013. Fox Soccer Plus, a spin-off channel which launched in 2010, continues to operate.

==History==
Launched on November 1, 1997, to March 27, 2005, when it was originally known as Fox Sports World, the channel took its final name March 28, 2005 to July 31, 2011, later dropping the word &quot;channel&quot; from its name on August 1, 2011 to September 1, 2013. Fox Soccer offered its own game programming for United States soccer leagues through arrangements with outside production companies.

Most of Fox Soccer&#x27;s coverage which originated outside the CONCACAF region (North America, Central America, Caribbean) consisted of picking up international broadcast feeds to which Fox Soccer had the U.S. broadcast rights. The A-League broadcasts were produced by Fox Sports (Australia). The English coverage generally came to Fox Soccer direct from IMG, Input Media and The Media Company, which produce the Premier League and FA Cup/England national team world feed broadcasts and Fox Soccer News reports respectively.

The network&#x27;s soccer coverage was not limited to game play; Fox Soccer aired reruns of &quot;Dream Team&quot;, a British soap opera that aired in the UK on Fox Soccer&#x27;s corporate cousin Sky One until 2007 and focused on a fictional Premiership team. The channel also televised a live soccer talk-show, &quot;Fox Football Fone-in,&quot; featuring viewer calls and predictions for that weekend&#x27;s Premier League matches. During the Premier League term, Fox Soccer also produced and aired a couple of studio-based shows surrounding its game coverage.

In 2006, Fox Soccer announced that they had dropped coverage of sports other than soccer. Amongst the leagues dropped were Super Rugby (rugby union), the Australian Football League (the principal Australian rules football league), and the Australian National Rugby League. The Super 14 games resided on Setanta Sports USA until it went off the air in early 2010, while ESPN offers the AFL. In return, Setanta gave Fox Soccer the rights to some national team matches that would not otherwise air live. After Setanta&#x27;s demise in the US, News Corporation acquired most of Setanta USA&#x27;s former rights and created the new Fox Soccer Plus as a second broadcast outlet.

Fox Sports World originally filled out its schedule with an eclectic mix of programming; among the sports featured (either in anthology form or actual events) were motorsports (prior to News Corporation&#x27;s acquisition of SPEED, now Fox Sports 1), cricket, pool, darts, and extreme sports. It also aired the Final Four of the Euroleague in basketball; that league is now more extensively covered by NBA TV. Cricket, pool and darts currently see American coverage on Willow and ONE World Sports, which also now broadcasts some Sky Sports programming.

Until the middle of 2012, the morning hours on non-game days (when the English and European afternoon is timed to in the United States) and some odd afternoon half hours were slotted with paid programming time until additional loops of &quot;Fox Soccer News&quot; and &quot;Sky Sports News&quot; were placed in those slots.

The 720p high definition simulcast of Fox Soccer launched in January 2010. The signature promo voice of the network was Jimmy Hodson.

==Programming==
The channel focused on soccer throughout the world. In the final year, the network&#x27;s rights included; (all rights have moved to Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2)

===United Kingdom===
*Premier League (1998-2013): Live and tape-delayed matches each week, plus weekly magazine (&quot;Premier League World&quot;), preview (&quot;Premier League Preview Show&quot;, and &quot;Matchday&quot;) and recap (&quot;Premier League Review&quot; and &quot;Goals on Sunday&quot;) shows. Besides matches on Fox Soccer, Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus, up to 3 matches each season were available live free-to-air on Fox. Up to 74 matches each season were sublicensed to ESPN, Inc. Contract ran through May 2013, at which point coverage went to NBC Sports/NBCSN to the present day.

===&quot;Sky Sports News&quot;===

Fox Soccer picked up the feed from its corporate cousin, Sky Sports News in the United Kingdom. In 2007, Fox Soccer began running the feed live at 2 a.m., noon and 7 p.m. Eastern Time (the 7 p.m. edition moved to Fox Soccer Plus effective September 2010). This arrangement dates back to its days as Fox Sports World, and offers updated soccer news throughout the day (along with coverage of other international sports such as rugby, cricket and British horse racing.), along with the morning rundown of English newspaper sports pages.

During the international off-season from May–August 2010 the 2am simulcast of the 7am GMT hour was replaced with a tape-delayed broadcast of &quot;Sky News at Ten&quot; from SSN &amp; Fox Soccer sister network Sky News, which features a comprehensive recap of the day in sports; likely this was due to 2010 World Cup highlights exclusivity by American rightsholder ESPN, in addition to Sky Sports News converting their operations to high definition. The 2am simulcast of Sky Sports News was restored in August 2010 with the start of the European season.

All simulcasts of Sky Sports News were discontinued on July 1, 2013, as Fox Soccer began their wind-down of operations, with Fox apparently deciding not to carry the program over to either Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, or Fox Soccer Plus.

===&quot;Fox Soccer Report&quot; and &quot;Fox Soccer News&quot;===

From September 2002 to August 16, 2012, Fox Soccer&#x27;s flagship studio program was &quot;Fox Soccer Report&quot; (originally &quot;Fox Sports World Report&quot;), anchored by Michelle Lissel, Eoin O&#x27;Callaghan and Asa Rehman, with former Scottish amateur footballer Bobby McMahon, produced by the Shaw Media-owned Fox Sports World Canada at the studios of CKND Winnipeg.

After Fox Sports World ceased operations in April 2012, Fox Soccer made similar arrangements with the Canadian sports channel Sportsnet for a replacement program. The Sportsnet-produced &quot;Fox Soccer News&quot; began airing August 17, 2012, with hosts Brendan Dunlop, Kara Lang, Ben Ennis, and analyst Thomas Rongen; McMahon also moved to Sportsnet and continued with &quot;Fox Soccer News&quot;, providing continuity between &quot;Fox Soccer Report&quot; and &quot;Fox Soccer News&quot;. It aired nightly at 10 p.m. Eastern (or after a live prime-time match – though highlights of that game would not be included because the show is taped), with a few re-airs overnight and during the morning.

With the launch of Fox Sports 1, the program was replaced by an in-house soccer news program, &quot;Fox Soccer Daily&quot;, on August 19, 2013 (Sportsnet continued to produce and air the prior program as &quot;Soccer Central&quot;), though that show was canceled by the end of the year. It was replaced with NFL playoff and NASCAR-focused programming and eventually, a video simulcast of Mike Francesa&#x27;s radio program.

===Past programming===

*Argentina: One match every week from the Argentine Primera División, plus the weekly highlights show &quot;Fútbol de Primera&quot;, through the 2009–10 season.
*Mexico: Limited coverage of the Primera División through the early part of the 2007 Apertura season. Showed home games from teams such as Cruz Azul, Pachuca, Santos Laguna and Tecos UAG.

==Relaunch as FXX==

Fox lost the U.S. television rights to broadcast Premier League soccer events to NBC, and the Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1 and EFL Championship rights to beIN Sports. As a result, Fox Soccer was replaced on September 2, 2013, by FXX, an entertainment sister network to FX. All of the remaining sports programming from Fox Soccer was moved to Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, which launched on August 17, 2013. FXX&#x27;s primary focus is on comedies (resulting in FX and FXX maintaining a genre-based format similar to that of TBS and TNT) and features original and acquired comedy series, though feature films and some drama series are also broadcast on FXX – with first-run episodes of some of the channel&#x27;s original series being carried over to the channel from FX.

Fox Soccer&#x27;s run ended with a final full run of &quot;&quot; on September 2 from midnight–6am ET (with an FXX disclaimer card before the program), leading into FXX airing the pilot episode of &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; an hour later at 7am ET, with paid programming with an FXX disclaimer card in front of each paid program in the hour between. The channel properly transferred from Fox Soccer to FXX an hour later, when a clip of FC Barcelona&#x27;s Lionel Messi about to score a goal (two scenes taken from the UEFA Champions League matches on April 3, 2012, and March 12, 2013) was broken up by Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito) of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; coming through a leather couch (representing a television screen being &quot;torn&quot; through) being &quot;birthed&quot; in the nude (a scene taken from the 2009 Christmas special episode &quot;A Very Sunny Christmas&quot;), suggesting the &quot;birthing&quot; of FXX. The last live international event carried was a UEFA Champions League match between Celtic F.C. and FC Shakhter Karagandy from Celtic Park on August 28. The last live match to be carried by the network altogether was the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League final between Portland Thorns FC and the Western New York Flash on August 31.

<text>The University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte, or simply Charlotte) is a public research university in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. UNC Charlotte offers 24 doctoral, 66 master&#x27;s, and 79 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs through nine colleges. It is classified among &quot;R1: Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production&quot;.

The university experienced rapid enrollment growth in the late 2000s and early-mid 2010s when it was the fastest-growing institution in the UNC System.

It has two campuses: the Main Campus, located in University City, and the Center City Campus in Uptown Charlotte. The main campus sits on 1,000 wooded acres with approximately 85 buildings about from Uptown Charlotte.

==History==

Prior to UNC Charlotte&#x27;s founding, Charlotte had long sought a public university. In the late 1880s, the city bid for what would become North Carolina State University, but lost to Raleigh after a local farmer offered to donate land for the campus. In 1946, the city sought a state-run medical school; instead, the state expanded the existing medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In 1946, to handle the expected surge of applicants resulting from the G.I. Bill, the Consolidated University of North Carolina (now the University of North Carolina) opened 12 &quot;extension centers&quot; across North Carolina. On September 23, 1946, the Charlotte Center of the University of North Carolina opened with an enrollment of 278 students. The Charlotte city school system was tasked with running the center, and it named doctoral student Charles Bernard director of the center. The center held night classes at Central High School in present-day Uptown Charlotte. It initially offered only freshman-level courses, but added sophomore-level courses in 1947 by demand. Also that year, Bernard resigned his position to resume his doctoral studies, and the center&#x27;s mathematics teacher, Bonnie Ethel Cone, was named director.

By 1948, the Charlotte Center was one of only four extension centers still open. The Consolidated University determined that its three campuses could handle student demand, and it announced that it would close the remaining centers on July 1, 1949. On April 4, 1949, in response to local efforts led by Cone, the North Carolina General Assembly created the Charlotte Community College System. The system included two schools, both of which opened in 1949: Charlotte College, which served white students, and Carver College, which served black students. In 1950, the state recognized Charlotte College as a &quot;standard junior college&quot;, allowing students to transfer credits to senior colleges.

Cone served as director—and later president—of the college, which continued to hold classes at Central High School. The school was racially desegregated as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954 (Carver College would later merge with another institution to become Central Piedmont Community College). By 1957, enrollment increased to 492, and the school&#x27;s leaders began searching for a permanent site for the campus. They decided on a tract of land northeast of the city. The college became state-supported in 1958 upon joining the newly formed North Carolina Community College System and moved to its current location in 1961. It added a junior year of study in 1963, and a senior year in 1964.

On March 3, 1965, the North Carolina General Assembly designated Charlotte College the fourth campus of the University of North Carolina, under its current name, effective July 1. On May 29, 1966, 81 students became the school&#x27;s first graduating class as a UNC system school. In 1969, the school opened its first dormitory, housing approximately 600 students, and also that year, the university began offering programs leading to master&#x27;s degrees. The school&#x27;s first graduate degree—a master of education—was awarded in May 1970. By 1973, enrollment had increased to 6,123 students, with 853 of those being graduate students.

In 1992, UNC Charlotte was authorized to offer programs leading to doctoral degrees.

===Leaders of the university===
====Bonnie Ethel Cone, founder====
Bonnie Ethel Cone (1907–2003), or Miss Bonnie as she was known to students, was chosen to be director of the Charlotte Center in 1947. From 1949 to 1965, she served as president of Charlotte College. When Charlotte College joined the UNC system in 1965, Cone served as acting chancellor until 1966.

====Chancellors====
Dean W. Colvard (1913–2007) was appointed the first chancellor of the young university in 1966. A North Carolina native, Colvard had served as president of Mississippi State University (MSU). At MSU he was the first president to defy university policy of not playing against integrated teams when he ordered the men&#x27;s basketball team to play Loyola University Chicago in 1963. At UNC Charlotte, Colvard took on the challenge of converting the school from a small college to a four-year member of the UNC system. Indeed, he had been chosen specifically because UNC system officials believed the newly minted UNC Charlotte needed a leader with experience running a four-year university. Colvard oversaw accreditation of the university, development of University Research Park (now one of the top five largest research parks in the country), constructed the first residence halls, created the first graduate programs, and grew the enrollment from about 1,700 to just over 8,000 students. He retired as chancellor in 1978, served as Chancellor Emeritus until his death. Colvard also received the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. The Colvard building, completed on the main campus in 1979, is named in his honor and houses the Department of Psychology.

E.K. Fretwell (1923–2012), the second chancellor of the university, was named in 1979. He came to the university from Buffalo State College where he was president. Under Fretwell, campus enrollment surged from 8,000 students to over 12,000. He oversaw the creation of the Graduate School, created more graduate degrees, integrated the library&#x27;s card catalog into the Internet in 1983, created the groundwork for a major business incubator, helped to develop the university&#x27;s surrounding neighborhood, and increased academic grants to over $6.1 million. Fretwell retired as chancellor in 1989. He served as interim president of the University of Massachusetts system from 1991 to 1992, and in 1998, he served as the interim president of the University of North Florida. In 1996 UNC Charlotte opened the Fretwell building, dedicated in honor of him and his wife Dorrie. The building headquarters the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences.

James H. Woodward succeeded Fretwell in 1989. Woodward came to UNC Charlotte from the University of Alabama at Birmingham where he served as dean of engineering and senior vice president of academic affairs. Under Woodward, enrollment grew to over 19,000 students. Like his predecessors, he continued the growth of the Graduate School and added new doctoral programs. He oversaw the largest fundraising campaign in the school&#x27;s history and its largest building boom; in the summer of 2005, no less than six buildings were actively under construction on the main campus. He also oversaw the creation of the CRI Campus. Woodward announced his retirement in 2004 and left the office of chancellor on June 30, 2005. Woodward Hall, which houses the College of Computing &amp; Informatics, was dedicated in his honor on November 16, 2005. He is currently Chancellor Emeritus and teaches in the university&#x27;s William States Lee College of Engineering.

Philip L. Dubois was the fifth leader and fourth chancellor of the university. Dubois assumed his duties as chancellor on July 15, 2005. He returned to Charlotte after serving as the president of the University of Wyoming from 1997 through 2005. Previously, he was the Provost and Professor of Political Science in the Department of Political Science (now the Department of Political Science and Public Administration) at UNC Charlotte from 1991 until 1997. Dubois, along with his wife and children, was the first chancellor to occupy the Chancellor&#x27;s Residence (known as the Bissell House) on the UNC Charlotte campus that was completed in the winter of 2005. His goal was to oversee the process of the university becoming the fourth research-extensive university in the state.

=== 2019 mass shooting ===
On April 30, 2019, a mass shooting occurred in the Woodford A. Kennedy Building on campus, killing two and leaving four others injured. The shooter, identified as Trystan Andrew Terrell, was arrested shortly afterwards.

==Campuses==

===Main Campus – University City===
The Main Campus of the university is situated on just under 1,000 acres (4 km2) of rolling land between U.S. Route 29 and N.C. Highway 49, about 10 miles (16 km) from Uptown Charlotte in the University City neighborhood. The campus is self-contained, meaning that no major roads run through the campus. The campus boasts several man-made lakes, and is heavily wooded. Near the center of campus are two gardens that attract over 300,000 visitors a year. The architecture of the original central campus, particularly the oldest buildings, are precast concrete and utilitarian-looking because they were built with limited state funds in the 1960s and 1970s. Starting in 2014, these buildings are being renovated to today&#x27;s standards. Under the campus&#x27; third chancellor, James Woodward, the campus underwent major changes which continue today. The newest buildings, funded from state bonds, are being constructed in brick with neoclassical architecture. Concrete and asphalt sidewalks have largely been replaced by brick. The campus&#x27; road system is being upgraded to include landscaped medians and more trees.

The former Charlotte Research Institute (CRI) occupied the northern portion of the Main campus. The university retired the CRI branding in 2019, and its operations are now part of the Office of Research Partnerships.

===Center City Campus===

The second campus—named the Dubois Center at UNC Charlotte Center City—is in the first ward of Uptown Charlotte. This campus houses the School of Professional Studies along with 23 academic programs. Formerly located in the Mint Museum of Craft+Design, the Uptown campus moved into the $50.4 million Center City building at 320 East 9th Street, on August 22, 2011. It is located one block away from the 9th Street Station of the Lynx Blue Line. The 12-story, 143,000 square foot Center City building was designed by architectural firm KieranTimberlake. The building features cantilevered multi-story blocks which resemble a stack of books.

<doc id="409850" wikidata="Q231374" url="?curid=409850" title="Shane Gould">
<text>Shane Elizabeth Gould (born 23 November 1956) is an Australian former competition swimmer. She won three gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze, at the 1972 Summer Olympics, becoming the first woman swimmer to win five individual medals. In 2018, she won the fifth season of &quot;Australian Survivor,&quot; becoming the oldest winner of any &quot;Survivor&quot; franchise.

Gould was born in Australia, but spent most of her childhood in Fiji after she and her family moved there. After her 1972 Olympic performance, Gould was named the Australian of the Year, and received an MBE in 1983. In April 2018, Gould was awarded an Order of Merit by the Australian Olympic Committee.

Gould returned in the 1990s as a swimming mentor and competitor, and again competed in 2003, specializing in the 200m Individual Medley. In 1999, she published her autobiography &quot;Tumble Turns&quot;. In 2018, she competed on &quot;Australian Survivor: Champions vs. Contenders&quot; and won&quot;,&quot; receiving $500,000 as the Sole Survivor&quot;.&quot; Gould later returned for &quot;Australian Survivor: All Stars,&quot; but was voted out first.

==Early education==
Gould was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on the first day of competition of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. She moved to Fiji with her family at the age of 18 months. By the age of six, she was a competent swimmer. She attended primary school at Brisbane&#x27;s St. Peters Lutheran College, currently the top-rated swim school in Australia. At St. Peters, a sporting house is named after her. She attended secondary school at Turramurra High School, Sydney, where a sporting house is also named after her and fellow Olympian Gail Neall.

From around February–June 1973, during her High School Junior year, she attended St. Francis High School in Mountain View, outside Los Altos, California. While at St. Francis, she was coached by Hall of Fame Coach Nort Thornton with the Foothill Aquatics Club. While attending St. Francis, she planned to compete in the Santa Clara International Invitational in June, and Cincinnati&#x27;s National AAU Championships in April. Two years earlier in the Santa Clara Invitational in July 1971 she set her third world record, lowering the previous mark in the 400-meter freestyle formerly set by Karen Moras in London a few months earlier.

===Coaching received===
She was trained by leading coaches Ursula and Forbes Carlile and their assistant Tom Green at the Forbes and Ursula Carlile Swimming Organization. She won all of her world swimming titles while a teenager, travelling widely. Carlile, a two-time Olympic Coach for Australia, was a physiologist at the University of Sydney, and at the forefront of providing scientific training to athletes. A leader in the use of interval workouts timed with pace clocks and in the use of heart rate tests for assessing effort, he helped popularize &quot;tapering&quot;, a method that slowly reduced training intensity in the weeks before important meets to maximize performance. He helped develop the crawl stroke, focusing on a high speed two beat kick which emphasized the strong use of the arms, a technique studied and adopted by Gould.

==Swimming career==
===1972 Munich Olympics===

At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, Gould won three gold medals in the 200 and 400-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter individual medley, setting a world record in each race. She won a silver in the 800 and a bronze in the 100-meter freestyle events.

She is the only person, male or female, to hold every world freestyle record from 100 metres to 1500 metres and the 200-metre individual medley world record simultaneously, which she did from 12 December 1971 to 1 September 1972. She is the first female swimmer ever to win three Olympic gold medals in world record time, and the first swimmer, male or female, to win Olympic medals in five individual events in a single Olympics. She is also the only Australian to win three individual gold medals at a single Olympics.

At the age of 16, she retired from competitive swimming, citing pressures placed upon her by her success and media profile.

Over two decades later, Gould returned to competitive swimming at the Masters level. She set Australian Masters records (40–44 years 100m, 200 m, and 400 m freestyle, and 100 m butterfly) and 45–49 years (50 m butterfly, 100 m and 200 m freestyle). In 2003, she broke the world record for the 45–49 years 200 m individual medley in 2:38.13 (beating the 1961 world record for all ages).

She coaches swimmers and still swims in Masters competitions.

== Later career ==

=== Education ===
Gould returned to study in the late 2000s. She studied at the Sydney Film School (2007, Cert IV documentary film, Digital Filmmaking) and was awarded a Master of Environmental Management (2010, with a thesis on the social uses and functions of public swimming pools), and a Master of Contemporary Art (2012, with a video piece &quot;Loops and Lines&quot;). Both degrees are from the University of Tasmania. In 2019 she was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree from Victoria University.

=== Olympics ===
In the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Gould carried the Olympic Torch at the stadium, as one of the runners for the final segment, before the lighting of the Olympic Flame.

=== Photography ===
Gould is a photographer with works on display with the Art of the Olympians.

=== Biography ===
In 1999, Gould published her autobiography &quot;Tumble Turns: An Autobiography.&quot;

=== Australian Survivor ===
In August 2018, it was revealed that Gould would be participating in &quot;Australian Survivor: Champions vs. Contenders&quot; and would be a part of the Champions tribe. On 9 October 2018, Gould was crowned the winner of &quot;Australian Survivor: Champions vs. Contenders&quot; in a 5–4 vote against criminal barrister Sharn Coombes.&quot;&quot; With this win, Gould became the oldest person to ever win any international series of &quot;Survivor&quot;.

She later returned for &quot;Australian Survivor: All Stars&quot;, but was voted out first, finishing in 24th place.

== Personal life ==
Gould spent most of the years after ending competitive swimming out of the public eye. She married Neil Innes at 18, became a Christian, and lived on a working farm near Margaret River in Western Australia&#x27;s South West. She farmed and taught horseriding and surfing, making very few public appearances. She has four children and three grandchildren.

Her marriage to Innes ended after 22 years, coinciding with a return to public life, and she married Milton Nelms in 2007.

On 10 October 2023, Gould was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum, initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.

<doc id="409855" wikidata="Q461469" url="?curid=409855" title="Mercedes-Benz S-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class, formerly known as Sonderklasse (German for &quot;special class&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;S-Klasse&quot;), is a series of full-sized luxury sedans and coupés produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz. The S-Class is the designation for top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz models and was officially introduced in 1972 with the W116, and has remained in use ever since. The S-Class is the flagship vehicle for Mercedes-Benz, being positioned above the other Mercedes-Benz models.

The S-Class has debuted many of the company&#x27;s latest innovations, including drivetrain technologies, interior features, and safety systems (such as the first seatbelt pretensioners). The S-Class has ranked as the world&#x27;s best-selling luxury sedan. In automotive terms, &quot;Sonderklasse&quot; refers to &quot;a specially outfitted car.&quot; Although used colloquially for decades, following its official application in 1972, six generations of officially named &quot;S-Klasse&quot; sedans have been produced.

In 1981, the two-door, four-seat S-Class, designated as SEC, was introduced, sharing the petrol V8 engines with its four-door version, W126. After the introduction of a new nomenclature scheme, SEC was simply renamed as S-Class Coupé. For the 1996 model year, the coupé was separated from the S-Class line and named as new CL-Class (in line with other two-door models: CLK, SL, and SLK); however, the CL-Class was reintegrated into the S-Class model line (same with CLK becoming E-Class Coupé and Cabriolet). The first-ever S-Class convertible since 1972, internally named A217, was introduced and became a one-generation model only. After the end of W222 production in 2020, the successors to the C217 coupé and A217 convertible are not planned, citing the low demand for those models and stronger demand for SUV models.


==Model nomenclature==

The major revision to the nomenclature scheme in 1991 renamed the S-Class with the &quot;S&quot; prefix that has three numbers for engine displacement in &quot;centilitre&quot; with no suffix for fuel type or wheelbase length. The extra information was sometimes affixed to the right-hand side of boot/trunk, denoting the diesel version (TURBODIESEL or later CDI), hybrid version (HYBRID), all-wheel-drive version (4MATIC), AMG, and MAYBACH. The second revision in 2015 allows the suffixes such as d (diesel), e (plug-in hybrid), and the h (mild hybrid) for several years before h was dropped. For 2018 model year, the model designation and AMG and MAYBACH labels switched their position to the left.


==Predecessor models==
===&quot;Ponton&quot; (1954)===

The W180 line debuted in 1954, and is the first lineup of &quot;Ponton&quot; models retroactively associated with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The W180 featured six-cylinder sedan, coupé, and convertible models, and was produced until 1959. It featured the 220S models (sedan, coupé, and cabriolet) powered by a 2.2L straight-6, and came to ten. The &quot;Ponton&quot; designation referred to its unibody construction, with the era&#x27;s rounded fenders a stylistic feature on the W180 model.
The &quot;Ponton&quot; lineup included four- and six-cylinder models, but only the six-cylinder W180 line is considered part of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class chronology, as they were the most powerful &quot;Ponton&quot; versions available. The Big &quot;Ponton&quot; model was Mercedes&#x27; first without a conventional frame, using a unitized body/frame construction.
===&quot;Fintail&quot; (1959)===

Mercedes-Benz Fintail () is an informal nickname given to Mercedes-Benz vehicles notable for the presence of tailfins. Though never officially designated as such — Mercedes-Benz claimed they were functional and designated them , assisting to mark the end of the car in the rear-view mirror. The Fintail series replaced the Ponton series.

The exterior was designed for the European and North American markets. The W111 was a chassis code given to its top-range vehicles, including four-door sedans, produced from 1959 to 1968, and two-door coupes and cabriolets from 1961 to 1971. The W111, was initially attributed only to six-cylinder cars with 2.2-litre engines. The luxury version with big-block 3-litre engines were given the chassis code W112. The entry-level vehicles with four-cylinder engines were called W110. All three versions W110, W111, and W112, in both two- and four-door bodies, were based on the same unibody structure.
===W108 (1965)===


The updated and larger W108/W109 model lines were introduced in 1965. The squarish W108 line included the straight-six M129 engine powered 250S, 250SE, 280S 280SE and 280SEL. In 1968 the 300 SEL 6.3 borrowed the 6.3-litre V8 from the W100 600 Pullman to offer a truly high-performance luxury sedan.

During this period, the designation S (for &quot;Sedan&quot;) was used for standard carbureted short-wheelbase models; an E (for &quot;Einspritzung&quot;, German for fuel-injection) was added to the 250SE, 280SE and 300SE. Long-wheelbase models gained an L (for &quot;Lang&quot;, German for &quot;long&quot;), reflecting an extra added in the rear passenger compartment. Since the advent of the W108 series, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has always included two wheelbase lengths, although not all wheelbases are sold in every country.

The more powerful 300SE and 300SEL models were classified as the W109 chassis, with front and rear air suspension (rather than the coil spring based W108 rear suspension), and available burl walnut interior trim, automatic transmission, and power windows.
In 1968, the W108 line dropped the 250SE in favor of the larger-engined 280S and 280SEL; the 250S remained as an entry model until 1969; the 300SE/SEL yielded their 3.0 litre inline-6 for the intermediate SL type (W113) 2.8 litre engine, and were later offered with a 3.5-litre V8 engine (in both the SE and SEL form, not in the U.S.) and 4.5-litre (U.S. only) and 6.3-litre V8 engines (in the SEL model only). The W108/109 lines, which eventually supplanted the W111 lines, were never available with four-cylinder engines.
==First generation (W116; 1972)==

In 1972, Mercedes-Benz introduced the W116 line, the first to be officially called the S-Class. Produced from 1972 through 1980, the W116 series featured a four-wheel independent suspension and disc brakes. The 280, 350, and 450 (4.5L version) models featured SE and SEL versions. Production of the W116 totaled 473,035 units. This was a groundbreaking sedan for Mercedes-Benz, and for the first time in the company history, the car had an obvious, blatant and outward emphasis on safety placed above a pure styling viewpoint. The overall design incorporated numerous safety features developed from the &quot;safety research vehicles&quot; in the mid-to-late 1960s to the very early 1970s.

These safety features were all newly introduced passenger-car &quot;firsts&quot; on a production vehicle: padded door trim around the windows, heavily padded steering wheel (later to be replaced by an airbag with the Mercedes-Benz abbreviation of SRS standing for the English-language term Supplemental Restraint System), more comprehensive safety padding on the dashboard and around the interior, dual asymmetric windshield wipers, headrests with a center depression to locate the occupant&#x27;s head in a more central position during a rear impact, a rain-water management system to improve visibility consisting of deep channels on both sides of the windshield and flowing into deeply channeled rain gutters, including similar designs on the side mirrors, rounded body shapes along the edges, such as the tops of the front fenders, etc., designed to ameliorate pedestrian injuries, ribbed rear taillamp lenses which would remain clearer of dirt on the recessed areas, an easy-to-access first aid kit stowed in a recessed compartment on the rear parcel shelf prominently labeled with the universally recognized &quot;cross&quot; symbol which represents &quot;first aid&quot;, and several other subtle safety features related to both active and passive safety. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is a classic chauffeur driven car, and has frequently been used as standard by car hire companies. It is comfortable and safe as well as elegant looking; ideal for drives across the countryside or high class transport on a night out.

The W116 models were large luxury sedans. The W116 was larger on the outside than the W108/W109 series it replaced, but had similar interior capacity, as the additional bulk was driven by several new and aforementioned engineering developments on car safety and occupant protection in a crash. The W116 introduced other improved passive safety features into the vehicle design, including a strengthened vehicle occupant shell. It was one of the first cars to be available with ABS, a driver&#x27;s airbag supplemental restraint system (but not available at the vehicle&#x27;s initial launch). Also, the W116 was the first mass production passenger vehicle offered with a turbocharged diesel engine.

The 450SE, then the most powerful model in the W116 lineup, was awarded European Car of the Year in 1974. At the New England Auto Show in 1972 held in the fall season in Boston, the Monroney Label of a 1973 450SE was right at $13,000. 1973 was the first model year of the W116 for the US market. Starting in 1975, the W116 was upgraded with a new fuel injection system to comply with revised exhaust emission standards in European markets. A slight power reduction was a result of this update, but in 1978, a series of further engine upgrades restored original performance levels under the new fuel injection systems. Between 1973 and 1977, 997 Special Edition W116 models were made on order by Mercedes. These cars incorporated stronger body paneling and suspension and was 50 kg heavier than its normal counterpart.


===Engines===
With the W116 models, the V8-engines of the 350/450 SE/SEL models were now regular options. Due to the oil crisis, fuel efficiency was the major concern for the engineers, yet they still added also the high-performance, limited-production 450 SEL 6.9. This 8-cylinder model, affectionately referred to as simply &quot;the 6.9&quot;, boasted the largest engine installed in a postwar Mercedes-Benz up to that time. Every 450 SEL 6.9 featured a self-leveling hydropneumatic suspension, and offered the ABS anti-lock braking system as an option from 1978 onwards. Also, in the United States and Canada only, Mercedes-Benz introduced the economical but powerful 3.0-litre 5-cylinder turbo-diesel OM 617 A producing in 1978, sold as the 300SD.
==Second generation (W126/C126; 1979)==

The W126 series premiered in September 1979, launching in March 1980 as a 1980 model and late 1980 as a 1981 model in the US and Australia replacing the W116 line. The W126 line featured improved aerodynamics and enlarged aluminum engine blocks. In Australia in 1981, the W126 S-Class won &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award. The W126 was manufactured from 1979 through 1991 with a mid-cycle update. Coupé models based on the S-Class were reintroduced with the W126 (380/500 SEC). Total sales of the W126 S-Class sedans reached 818,036 units, with an additional 74,060 coupes sold.

In December 1980, the W126 introduced a driver side airbag, as patented by Mercedes-Benz in 1971, as well as passenger side airbags (in 1988), seat-belt pretensioners, and traction control. It was the first production car to feature an airbag standard, and as late as 1991 there were only a few other manufacturers in Europe who offered an airbag. The interior featured additional courtesy and reading lamps, along with heated seats and a more advanced climate control system. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard.

Although the top of range Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 of the previous generation was not directly replaced, the W126 carried forward the hydropneumatic suspension of the 6.9 as an option on the 500SEL. A new cruise control system was offered as well. Succeeding the roadster based coupes, the W126 introduced a two-door variant, the SEC coupé. The W126 S-Class received a mid-cycle update in 1985 that included both exterior modifications and engine upgrades.

===Engines===
The power plants on the W126 S-Class included straight-6 and V8 engines. Most sales came from the diesel model in Europe and straight-six models in the United States, although the V8 models were praised by contemporary journalists. The US initially received only the smaller of the two V8 engines, the 3.8 litre, which turned out to be a disaster, both due to timing chain repair issues, and to being severely underpowered, with 0- acceleration in a leisurely 11 seconds and a modest top speed of . The 5.0 litre engine was far more capable, with 0- acceleration in 7.3 seconds and a top speed of . During the W126 mid-cycle update in 1986, both the straight-6 and V8 engines were upgraded in several models to different displacement levels (six-cylinder upgraded from 2.8 L to 3.0 L, eight-cylinder upgraded from 3.8 L to 4.2 L, and 5.0 L to 5.6 L).

==Third generation (W140/C140; 1991)==


In 1991, the W140 series replaced the W126 line with the first production model assembled in April of that year. The W140 grew in proportions and featured two wheelbase lengths and a shorter-wheelbase W140 coupé. Production totalled 432,732 units.

The W140 cost 25% more than the W126 that it replaced and featured double-pane window glazing, self-closing boot lid and doors, electric windows with a jam-protection feature (lowering when encountering an obstruction), rear-parking markers in the US (which appeared on the rear wings when in reverse), and a heating system which emitted warm air while residual energy was available after the engine was turned off.

In 1993, Mercedes-Benz model nomenclature was rationalized, with the SE/SEL/SEC cars becoming the S-Class and alphanumerical designations inverted (e.g. both the 500SE and 500SEL became S500 regardless of wheelbase length). In 1995, the W140 received a minor face lift featuring clear turn signal indicator lenses on the front and rear as well as headlamps fitted with separate low- and high-beam reflectors for the US market. Following the mid-year face lift, the W140 coupe and sedan (Saloon) featured Electronic Stability Control. The W140 is heavily referred to or nicknamed as the Mercedes &quot;Shabah/شبح&quot; (Meaning &quot;ghost&quot; when translated) in many Middle Eastern countries.
==Fourth generation (W220; 1998)==


Mercedes-Benz presented the W220 in July 1998, marketed as a sedan, only. Despite being smaller than the previous generation, the W220 offered more interior space. Production of the W220 totaled 485,000 units.

The W220 introduced air suspension, marketed as Airmatic, as well as a navigation system with center console-mounted screen display, along with its input control system, marketed as COMAND. Other options included keyless entry and ignition, a radar-controlled cruise control system marketed as Distronic and a cylinder shut-off system marketed as Active Cylinder Control. The all-wheel drive system was introduced to the North America market S-Class for 2003, and marketed as 4MATIC.

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; classified the W220 model&#x27;s reliability as &quot;poor,&quot; its lowest rating, and called it one of the &quot;least reliable luxury cars;&quot; Edmunds gave the S-Class a 5 out of 5 reliability rating; and MSN Autos gave a rating of 9.0 out of 10. By March 2011, Consumer Reports revised its reliability ratings for the 2001 and 2002 S-Class to &quot;average&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; described the W220 S500 as &quot;built remarkably well.&quot; Early W220s in 1999 were recalled for issues with the trunk spring and the hydraulic fuel line; there were no recalls for the 2005 or 2006 model years.

In 2002, Mercedes-Benz introduced the world&#x27;s first preemptive safety system on the W220 with a system marketed as Pre-Safe. The W220 received an exterior refresh with updates to the front fascia. The grille angle was adjusted to a slightly more upright position, and the xenon-discharge headlamps were given a new transparent housing, replacing the earlier opaque versions. The front bumper&#x27;s lower air intakes were also restyled. In 2005, the S-Class was the first vehicle to receive a TÜV Institute environmental certificate from the German Commission on Technical Compliance for environmentally friendly components.
===Engines===
The W220 was available with more engine options than the W126 or W140. The range started with smaller 2.8 (Singapore) then 3.2L V6 motor, which was superseded by an enlarged 3.7 L V6 in the S350. The S430 was powered by a 4.3 L V8 and the S500 was powered by a 5.0 L V8. The S55 AMG was outfitted with a supercharged 5.4 L V8 motor, the S55 AMG 2000/2001 was outfitted with the naturally aspirated 5.4 L V8 motor. The S600 was outfitted with a 5.5 L M275 V12 biturbo engine, the S600 2000/2001 was outfitted with the naturally aspirated M137 5.8 L V12 engine.

In 2001, Mercedes produced a very rare S 63 AMG with a 5 speed automatic transmission and a modified version of the M137 V12 engine (displacement went up from 5.8 to 6.3 litres, 6258 cc) making at 5,500 RPM, and of torque at 4000 RPM. 70 examples were manufactured and marketed in Europe and Asia.

In 2003, Mercedes debuted the S 65 AMG, powered by a bi-turbocharged M275 AMG V12 engine and a 5 speed automatic transmission, it produced at 5100 RPM, and of torque at 4000 RPM. Acceleration from 0 to was officially rated at 4.4 seconds (0 to in 4.2 seconds), and the car was limited to .

==Fifth generation (W221; 2005)==


The W221 was introduced in the autumn of 2005 at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, with sales starting in autumn of 2005 and export to other markets beginning in 2006. Again there was a big change in design. The W221 S-Class made its North American premiere at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January. The W221 is slightly larger in all dimensions than its predecessor, and it features three newly developed engines with up to 26% power increase. The interior is completely new, all materials have been upgraded and make for a more luxurious ride, and the center console transmission gear lever has been replaced with a column-mounted shifter. New technological features on the W221 include an infrared Night View Assist feature and the latest Mercedes-Benz pre-collision system. The W221 features sharper exterior styling (most notably wide fender arcs) and technological improvements. The W221 is the second consecutive generation of the S-Class to be solely produced in a sedan body style.

Models sold in North America are the S450 (2008– , SWB and Canada only), S400 Hybrid (2010– ), S350 Bluetec 4MATIC (2012– ), S550, S600, S63 AMG and S65 AMG; other models to be sold outside North America include the S280, S350, S300, S420 CDI and S320 CDI. The first W221 model released in North America and Japan was the S550 (called S500 outside North America), with the S600 arriving in the following spring.

In the US for the 2010 model year, the S-Class received a facelift across the entire model line in mid-2009, with a new S400 Hybrid version. Daytime LED running lights were fitted to the outer edges of the bi-xenon lamp units. The rear end was accented with a total of 52 distinctively arranged LEDs in the two taillights. Gone are the body-coloured strips through the tail lamps. Other noticeable changes at the front of the car are a more pronounced arrow-shaped grille, a new front bumper with a light-catching contour, and a chrome strip below the cooling air intakes. New, sleeker rear-view door mirrors with LED turn signals were also added. The exhaust tailpipes of all S-Class variants were visibly integrated into the rear bumper. The wheels were updated to more modern-style ones. Safety is also improved on most Mercedes-Benz models with the orange-coloured light reflectors mounted on the sides of the bumpers. The C-Class look at the front is removed. Some shiny chrome is added to the bottom of the doors and bumper.

In terms of performance, the S550 completes the 0– run in just 5.4 seconds. Despite weighing , the S65 AMG still makes in just 4.2 seconds. The S600 makes the same sprint in about 4.6 seconds.
The brakes continue to become more advanced with the new Brake Assist Plus system monitoring for an impending collision and increasing braking if needed, while the Distronic Plus radar-guided cruise control can now bring the car to a complete stop. This system works in outdoor conditions; a test demonstration by Mercedes-Benz in a crash-test hall resulted in embarrassment for the company when a new S-Class crashed into the back of a stationary W220 S-Class. This incident was later attributed to the radar system malfunctioning inside the radar-reflective (i.e. radar-confusing) steel test building where the event was filmed.

Upscale department store Saks Fifth Avenue offered 20 special-edition S600 sedans for sale in its 2005 Christmas catalog. All 20 cars, priced at US$145,000 each, were sold on November 22, 2005, in under seven minutes. The Saks-edition S600 sedans were finished in a mocha black exterior with an almond beige interior and were the first examples of the S600 to be sold to private owners. The S600s came with nearly every option standard. In 2007, &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; named the W221 S-Class as one of its 2007 &quot;All-Stars&quot; over rivals from Lexus and BMW, and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; selected the S550 as the winner in a five-way comparison test of flagship luxury sedans, as did &quot;Motor Trend Magazine&quot; in July 2009 in a three-way comparison test, with the other two competitors being the BMW 750Li, and Audi A8L 4.2 Quattro. The W221 S-Class was also the recipient of several other motoring awards (see following).
==Sixth generation (W222/C217/A217; 2013)==

Officially unveiled in May 2013, the new S-Class has a more streamlined appearance than the outgoing model. Some interesting features include a large front grille inspired by the F700 Concept car and LED lights used exclusively inside and out — a first in the automotive industry. Two strong converging character lines give the flanks a more sculpted look, while integrated exhaust tips and a large glass roof (likely optional) highlight the design.

Along with the sedan, the S-Class spawned a coupe (Mercedes-Benz C217) and convertible (Mercedes-Benz A217) as well as an extended-wheelbase &#x27;Pullman&#x27; variant, longer than the long-wheelbase &#x27;L.&#x27; While the short-wheelbase model carries chassis code W222, the long-wheelbase model uses chassis code V222. Unlike previous generations, Mercedes focused primarily on the development of the longer model as many customers in the fast-growing Asian markets prefer to be chauffeured. In 2016 Mercedes W222 was the last car with an S65 AMG engine.

===Equipment===
Inside, almost every surface is covered by a &#x27;luxury&#x27; material – everything that looks like leather is genuine leather, and metal is used rather than any plastic alternative. The instrument cluster consists entirely of two widescreens (30.5 cm diagonal) LCDs with animated graphics. A &#x27;Head-Up&#x27; display and gesture-responsive touchpad became options in early 2014. It featured a new infotainment system.

The W222 debuts the available Magic Body Control, consisting of windshield-mounted stereo cameras that can &#x27;read&#x27; the road ahead (Road Surface Scan) and communicate with the Active Body Control suspension to ready it for an uneven road surface. Initially available only on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car&#x27;s body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps.

Available luxury appointments over and above what was offered in the W221 include a choice of massage type for each seat occupant (the W221 offered various intensities of a single massage type) and two levels of premium audio from the luxury German brand, Burmester.

The W222 has driver assistance systems aboard that allow it to steer a course within a lane and follow a leading vehicle for a short period (DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist, also called traffic jam assistant). It will also slow or come to a dead stop and accelerate in response to traffic ahead. Mercedes engineers claim to have, under controlled conditions, ridden aboard a W222 S Class that has driven autonomously for 50 km, merely by altering parameters controlling equipment already fitted. Such modifications are not available to the general public.

===Powertrain===
Like the W221 S500, the W222 S-Class is powered by a more powerful twin-turbo V8 producing while the S600 will carry a twin-turbo V12. There is also a diesel-powered S350 BlueTEC version, a hybrid S400 with a electric motor and V6 engine, a diesel-electric hybrid S300 BlueTEC. An S500 Plug-in Hybrid was later introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) with a market release in 2014 and claimed a mileage, a CO2 rating of and up to of emissions-free driving. The S500 Plug-In hybrid is fitted with a 3-litre V6 and an electric motor. AMG fettled S63 (V8 bi-turbo) and S65 (V12 bi-turbo) LWB sedans are also on offer. All S-Class models will come with a 7-speed automatic transmission.

==Seventh generation (W223; 2020)==
The W223 was unveiled on 2 September 2020. This generation will not feature a coupe or convertible model as they will instead be replaced by the next generation AMG GT and SL-Class models respectively. The interior of the new model includes up to five displays, augmented reality head-up display and an ambient lighting system. Additionally, the W223 S-Class is the first car in the world to come with rear seat airbags that work by using gas to inflate supporting structures to deploy a bag that fills with ambient air, instead of conventional fully gas-inflated airbags that are widely used in automotive airbag systems. On 5 December 2022 Mercedes-AMG has debuted the S 63 E Performance V8 PHEV with 802 HP.
==Engineering==
Mercedes-Benz has been able to exploit their perceived engineering know-how as a marketing tool, culminating in its one-time slogan, &quot;engineered like no other car in the world.&quot; This slogan was used throughout the 1980s with the marketing of the W126 S-Class. However, following the formation of DaimlerChrysler and the cessation of engineer-sanctioned overbudgeting in the late 1990s, this slogan was dropped. The subsequent W220 model S-Class was reported to suffer from relatively lower reliability and quality rates than previous models. However, ratings have been improving since the W221.

==Concept cars==

In the 1980s, Mercedes-Benz built the world&#x27;s first driverless cars using the S-Class, together with the team of Professor Ernst Dickmanns at Bundeswehr Universität München. The culmination of this effort was achieved in 1995, when Dickmanns&#x27; re-engineered autonomous S-Class robot completed a trip from Munich, Bavaria to Copenhagen, Denmark and back. On the autobahn, the robot S-Class achieved speeds exceeding . It suggested and executed overtaking maneuvers. The car&#x27;s abilities left a big impression on many observers and are said to have heavily influenced robot car research and funding decisions worldwide.

A concept future hybrid, the F700 research car, was also unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The F700 featured three regular opening doors and a fourth door capable of 180-degree rotation. The concept also featured bulletproof and puncture-resistant tires.

==Safety==
Mercedes-Benz has traditionally introduced its safety innovations in the S-Class. For instance, the S-Class was the first car in Europe to incorporate airbags. S-Class safety features included innovations in active safety (accident avoidance), passive safety (collision protection), and holistic safety (integration of both active and passive safety features). Active safety features include: ABS braking in 1978 (acts to reduce braking distances and improve stopping control; co-developed with Bosch); traction control and Electronic Stability Program (ESP) in 1995 (improves driver control during difficult road conditions); and Brake Assist (provides full braking power during emergency stops). In 2005, a new infrared night vision feature was introduced (improves visibility during nighttime conditions). Despite the popular misconception, the S-Class was not the first car fitted with ABS braking technology, although some credit can be given for popularizing this now largely standard feature (ABS was initially an option on most models of the W126 S-Class). Active lane keeping became standard in 2011.
Passive safety features include: crumple zones in 1957 (vehicle body structure absorbs the force of impact); collapsible steering column (prevents the steering column from protruding into the cabin during accidents), strengthened occupant cell enhanced occupant protection during severe impacts (rollovers); pre-accident seatbelt tensioning (tightens seatbelts prior to impact), and sandwich platforms (allows the engine to slide under the occupants in a head-on collision).

PRE-SAFE, Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s holistic safety feature, was introduced on the S-Class in 2002. PRE-SAFE integrates multiple active and passive safety features for a &quot;safety net&quot; approach to vehicle safety by attempting to prevent accidents; if accidents do occur, &quot;PRE-SAFE&quot; aims to reduce occupant injury. In the latest version of this pre-collision system, PRE-SAFE will prime the brake assist system, lock the doors to prevent accidental opening during the accident, adjust the seats, close the windows and sunroof, and tighten seatbelts during certain types of collisions. In the event an accident results in a rollover, the PRE-SAFE feature unlocks the doors and lowers the windows approximately to allow you to exit or safety workers to gain access easily.

Rear seat airbags are a world-first and will be introduced on the W223. In addition, E-ACTIVE BODY CONTROL is available for the first time on an S-Class.

===S-Guard===
A special armored version of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been produced, known as the S-Guard. Features include the capability to withstand small arms fire and certain explosive devices, a self-sealing fuel tank, and an alarm system.

In 2009, Mercedes-Benz launched a long-wheelbase version of the S-Guard, known as the Pullman Guard. This model is longer than the standard model. It also has a higher roof and a taller rear window, with a different rake. The Pullman Guard is also available in the W222 and the W223.

The S-Guard is widely used at the diplomatic level to protect world leaders. Ninety governments worldwide are known to use the S-Guard for the transport of government leaders and dignitaries. The S-Guard is built on a special production line at the S-Class facility in Sindelfingen, Germany, with specific S-Guard enhancements integrated at multiple stages throughout the production process.

==Production==

Most S-Class models, including the W221, are built at the Daimler AG plant in Sindelfingen, Germany, and the Mercedes-Benz-Valdez plant in Santiago Tianguistenco, Mexico. Founded by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in 1915, the Sindelfingen plant also produced the model 600 &quot;Grosser Mercedes&quot; and past generations of the S-Class. Previous S-Class models (such as the W126) were built in different locations ranging from Stuttgart to South Africa, but with recent models (such as the W220) production has been concentrated in Sindelfingen and Santiago Tianguistenco. In February 2007, DaimlerChrysler Malaysia&#x27;s (now, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia) plant in Pekan, Pahang began production of S350 (model W221) vehicles and is currently assembling S300, S350L, and S500L. In all, some 2.7 million S-Class vehicles have been produced in the past forty years.

==Sales==
==Awards==
Notable examples of awards received by the Mercedes-Benz S-Class include the top ranking in the J.D. Power Sales Satisfaction Index from 1987 to 1990, seven time ranking as &quot;What Car?&quot; &quot;Best Luxury Car&quot;, and five times as &quot;Fleet News&quot; &quot;Luxury Car of the Year&quot;. The S-Class was &quot;Wheels Magazine&quot; Car of the Year for 1981 and 1999, U.S. Highway Loss Data Institute &quot;Safest Passenger Car of the Year&quot; in 1988 and 1989, and European Car of the Year in 1974. The S-Class is also the first car ever (2005) to receive an environmental certificate from the German Commission on Technical Compliance (TÜV). Other awards range from &quot;Popular Science&quot; Best of What&#x27;s New—Grand Award 2005 to &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Limousine of the Year&quot; for 2006.

<text>The Four Lads were a Canadian male singing quartet that earned many gold singles and albums in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Their million-selling signature tunes include &quot;Moments to Remember&quot;; &quot;Standing on the Corner&quot;; &quot;No, Not Much&quot;; &quot;Who Needs You?&quot; and &quot;Istanbul&quot;.

The Four Lads appeared on many television shows, including &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot; (1958); Perry Como&#x27;s show &quot;Perry Presents&quot; (1959); &quot;Frankie Laine Time&quot; (1956); and the award-winning PBS special, &quot;Moments to Remember: My Music.&quot;

The most recent incarnation of the group featured lead tenor Don Farrar, second tenor Aaron Bruce, baritone Alan Sokoloff, and bass singer Frank Busseri.

The original quartet grew up together in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where they learned to sing at St. Michael&#x27;s Choir School. The founding and core members were Corrado &quot;Connie&quot; Codarini, bass; John Bernard &quot;Bernie&quot; Toorish, tenor and vocal arranger; James F. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Arnold, lead; and Frank &quot;Frankie&quot; Busseri, baritone and group manager. Codarini and Toorish had formed a group with two other St. Michael&#x27;s students, Rudi Maugeri and John Perkins, who were later to found The Crew-Cuts.

==History==
The group was known variously as The Otnorots (&quot;Toronto&quot; spelled backwards) and The Jordonaires (not to be confused with The Jordanaires who sang background vocals on Elvis Presley&#x27;s hits). When Maugeri and Perkins left the group to concentrate on their schoolwork, Codarini and Toorish joined with Arnold and Busseri in a new quartet. At home, they practiced until they achieved their clean-cut harmonies, whether for spirituals, sacred music, or pop. They originally called themselves “The Four Dukes”, but found out that a Detroit group already used that name, so they changed it to The Four Lads. In 1950, they began to sing in local clubs and soon were noticed by scouts. Recruited to go to New York, they were noticed there by Mitch Miller, the artists and repertoire man at Columbia Records, who asked them to sing backup for some of the artists he recorded. One of those artists, Johnnie Ray, became a major hit in 1951 with &quot;Cry&quot; and &quot;The Little White Cloud That Cried&quot;, with the Four Lads backing him.

After the success of Ray&#x27;s first hit songs, the Four Lads signed a recording contract with Columbia. In early 1952, they recorded their first song, &quot;Turn Back&quot;, penned by group member Bernie Toorish under the name &quot;Dazz Jordan&quot;. Released by Columbia subsidiary Okeh Records (Okeh 6860), the song failed to make an impression. Sometime later that year, the group scored their first-ever hit record with &quot;The Mocking Bird&quot; (Okeh 6885), another Toorish composition. Based on a melody from the second movement of Antonin Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9 (known as the “New World Symphony”) and featuring an extremely limited accompaniment of percussion and bass, &quot;The Mocking Bird&quot; peaked at #23 on the Billboard pop charts. The Four Lads were quickly switched over to the Columbia label, where they continued to garner more hits, and stayed there until 1960.

In 1953, the Four Lads had their first gold record, with &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;, a song that gave them their first U.S. top-ten hit and propelled them to even more stardom.

The group&#x27;s most famous hit was 1955&#x27;s &quot;Moments to Remember.&quot; Another famous hit was &quot;Standing on the Corner&quot;, from the Broadway musical &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;, in 1956. A gospel album with Frankie Laine took them back to their roots and produced the hit single &quot;Rain, Rain, Rain&quot;, written by Toorish under the pseudonym &quot;Jay McConologue&quot;. The Four Lads&#x27; Columbia recordings have seen releases and reissues on numerous studio albums and compilations over the years.

In late 1958, the group&#x27;s re-recording of &quot;The Mocking Bird&quot; became their last Top 40 pop hit. In 1959, their final pop chart appearance was with &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot;, a song from the movie of the same name that peaked at #77. When their Columbia contract expired in 1960, the group spent the rest of the 1960s recording for the Kapp, Dot and United Artists labels without ever hitting the charts again.

Codarini was replaced in 1962 by Johnny D&#x27;Arc (who remained with the Lads until 1982) and later fell into destitution. As Toorish once recalled, &quot;[Connie] made a terrible mistake. [He] married a model. [She] drove him crazy. He was working in a restaurant for a while.&quot; Toorish, who was burned out after twenty years of performing, was replaced by Sid Edwards in the early 1970s and became an insurance businessman. Arnold left the group in 1980 to become a voice teacher in Sacramento, California. Busseri remained with the group, and performed regularly with various members until late 2018.

Johnny D&#x27;Arc died in 1999, aged 60, in Riverside, California. Jimmy Arnold died in 2004, aged 72, in Sacramento, California.
Codarini died on April 28, 2010, in Concord, North Carolina, aged 80. Frank Busseri died in Rancho Mirage, California, on January 28, 2019, aged 86. Aaron Bruce (Aaron Bruce Grattidge), who was working as a radio DJ between performances, died in Topeka, Kansas in August 2020, aged 79.

In 1984, the Four Lads were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS). They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003.

<text>Conn is a masculine English and Irish-language given name, as well as an English-language surname. The origin of the given name is uncertain. It may be related to the Old Irish &quot;cond&quot; (&quot;intellect&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;king&quot;), or perhaps to the Old Irish &quot;cenn&quot; (&quot;head&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;, &quot;queen&quot;). The latter word-origin may have resulted from a popular, but incorrect etymology, applied to the Old Irish terms &quot;Leth Cuinn&quot; and &quot;Dál Cuinn&quot;; these terms originally meant &quot;half of the chief&quot; or &quot;half of the king&quot; and &quot;tribe of the chief&quot; but were mistakenly regarded to mean &quot;half of &quot;Conn&quot;&quot; and &quot;tribe of &quot;Conn&quot;&quot;. In some cases the given name is as a short form of names that begin with the first syllable &quot;Con-&quot; (such as the names &quot;Conor&quot; and &quot;Connor&quot;).

<text>Francesco Tamagno (28 December 1850 – 31 August 1905) was an Italian operatic dramatic tenor who sang with enormous success throughout Europe and America. On 5 February 1887, he sang Otello in the first performance of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera. He is also the earliest Italian tenor of note to have left a sizeable body of recordings of his voice. He was one of the first international male public figures to admit that he was the single parent and caregiver of a daughter from her birth.

==Musical significance==
The most famous heroic tenor of his age, Tamagno performed in 26 countries, gaining renown for the power of his singing, especially in the upper register. Tamagno was among the rare species of singers known as a &quot;tenore robusto&quot; or &quot;tenore di forza&quot;, and critics likened the sound of his voice to that of a trumpet or even a cannon. Tamagno&#x27;s vocal range extended up to high C-sharp during his prime, but he was no mere ”belter” of high notes; his recordings provide evidence of his ability, even at career&#x27;s end, to sing softly when required, modulating the dynamic levels of his voice with skill and sensitivity.

Best known as the creator of the protagonist&#x27;s part in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; at La Scala, Milan in 1887, he also was the first Gabriele Adorno in Verdi&#x27;s 1881 revision of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, a far more lyrical assignment than the &quot;Moor of Venice&quot;. He participated in the premiere of Verdi&#x27;s Italian-language version of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; when it was staged at La Scala in 1884, singing the eponymous role of the Infante of Spain. Five other operas in which Tamagno created leading roles were Carlos Gomes&#x27; &quot;Maria Tudor&quot; (in 1879), Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;Il figliuol prodigo&quot; (1880) and &quot;Marion Delorme&quot; (1885), Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;I Medici&quot; (1893) and Isidore de Lara&#x27;s &quot;Messaline&quot; (1899).

He was lauded for his performances of such established parts as Manrico in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, Don Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, the title roles in &quot;Ernani&quot; and &quot;Poliuto&quot;, Arnold in &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, John of Leyden in &quot;Le prophète&quot;, Raoul in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, Vasco in &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, Robert in &quot;Robert le diable&quot; and Eleazar in &quot;La Juive&quot;. He excelled in the newer dramatic parts of Radames in &quot;Aida&quot;, Samson in &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, Alim in &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; and John the Baptist in &quot;Hérodiade&quot;. Yet, in his younger days, before his voice grew too robust, he was able to negotiate a role as light and graceful as that of Edgardo in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; due to his accomplished &quot;mezza-voce&quot; singing.

Tamagno sang in approximately 55 different operas and sacred works (including Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; and Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;) during the course of his career as a soloist, which began in Turin in 1873 and continued for another 32 years, only to be curtailed by the onset of a cardiovascular affliction that killed him in middle age. With one notable exception, Tamagno largely eschewed verismo opera, considering it to be an uncomfortable fit with his stylistic training in the bel canto tradition. That notable exception was Umberto Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;. He studied the score of &quot;Chénier&quot; with Giordano in 1898 and earned accolades for his magisterial delivery of the tenor lead&#x27;s four showpiece solos at ensuing productions of the work. He was on friendly terms, too, with Giordano&#x27;s rival Giacomo Puccini. In 1892, he took part in a revival of Puccini&#x27;s flawed early opera &quot;Edgar&quot; which was staged in Madrid under the supervision of the composer, but even Tamagno&#x27;s involvement in the enterprise was not enough to reinvigorate &quot;Edgar&quot; and it remains rarely heard. (Tamagno also ventured a few performances of Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s archetypal verismo piece, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, in New York City in 1894.)

To paraphrase Tamagno&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of 1 September 1905, such was the extraordinary facility of the tenor&#x27;s upper register, he made the hurling forth of his high A, B and C sound as easy as everyday speech. Like all singers, however, he had his vocal shortcomings and bad habits. The vibrant, power-packed tone of his voice, while thrilling, could never be described as &quot;honeyed&quot; or &quot;seductive&quot; and this reduced the effectiveness of his contribution to the more intimate passages of love duets, such as the one for the protagonist and Desdemona that crowns Act One of &quot;Otello&quot;. He was not an adroit sight-reader, justifying this limitation by insisting that he was an emotional person who preferred to deliver his music from the &quot;heart&quot; rather than from the &quot;head&quot;. Critics occasionally reprimanded him for striving to maximise the excitement factor of his performances by holding on to top notes longer than necessary and by sometimes pushing them sharp. He was also chided intermittently for getting behind or ahead of the conductor&#x27;s beat.

Tamagno pursued a busy and highly acclaimed career that lasted for more than three decades. During that time, he sang at almost every important theatre in Europe, South America and the United States. While he was not a sophisticated actor or a flawless musician, his huge voice and volcanic renditions of the most forceful tenor roles in the Italian and French repertoires had a tremendous impact on audiences, enabling him to build a worldwide reputation, and to charge promoters on both sides of the Atlantic top-tier fees for his services.

==Life and singing career==
Born into a large family in the northern Italian city of Turin (Torino) in 1850, Tamagno was the son of a wine seller who ran a modest trattoria. His vocal promise manifested itself early, and although encouraged by his parents to learn a trade, he was still able to take singing lessons with the conductor and composer Carlo Pedrotti at Turin&#x27;s Liceo Musicale music school and gain experience as a chorister.

In 1873, Tamagno completed his musical studies, and having got a stint of compulsory military service out of the way, he undertook a few small parts at Turin&#x27;s Teatro Regio (Royal Theatre), of which institution Pedrotti was the director. He then made the most of an opportunity to execute a major operatic role, bursting into prominence on 20 January 1874 with a sensational performance as Riccardo in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; at the Teatro Bellini, Palermo. Tamagno embarked on a series of follow-up singing engagements in Ferrara, Rovigo, Venice and Barcelona which raised his profile further and enabled him to make his debut at Milan&#x27;s La Scala in 1877.

La Scala was Italy&#x27;s principal opera theatre, and Tamagno became a core member of its company of singers. His voice continued to mature at La Scala, reaching its full potential after a few years of spirited use in a variety of operas. He enjoyed the added advantage of working closely with Verdi, and his vocalism acquired a discipline and polish that hitherto it had lacked. According to &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera&quot;, he eventually took part in every La Scala season until the end of 1887 and appeared there again in 1901 as a guest artist. He did not completely turn his back on Turin, however, and he found time to sing periodically in his hometown; indeed, his last known public engagement occurred in Turin in 1905.

Argentina was an overseas bastion of Italian opera throughout this period, and Tamagno undertook the first of several well-remunerated visits to Buenos Aires in 1879. Earlier, in 1875–1876, he had sung in Spain. His international career did not take off explosively until 1888, with the role of Otello—which Verdi had written with Tamagno&#x27;s voice in mind—serving as his global calling card. Music-performance historian John Potter noted regarding &quot;Otello&quot; in his 2009 book, &quot;Tenor: History of a Voice&quot; (Yale University Press, p. 61): &quot;The title role was one of the most taxing tenor parts ever written and was created specifically for the unique talents and vocal &quot;persona&quot; of Tamagno. The requirements of the role, an imposing physical presence capable of combining lyrical sweetness with stentorian declamation that ranges from a rich baritonal middle to a ringing upper register, have made it problematic to cast ever since.&quot;
Tamagno toured sedulously during the final dozen years of the 19th century, accepting lucrative invitations to perform Otello and other strenuous operatic roles in countries as diverse as England, France, Portugal, Spain (again), Germany, Austria, Russia, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. He performed often at the fashionable Monte Carlo Opera and appeared at key musical venues in the North American cities of New York City, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and San Francisco. Tamagno&#x27;s obituary in the&quot; New York Times&quot; says that he sang in the United States for the first time in 1890. The prominent American impresario Henry Eugene Abbey managed him during that trans-Atlantic visit.

To give just five specific examples of Tamagno&#x27;s foreign engagements in the wake of the 1887 premiere of &quot;Otello&quot;, he performed at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1894–1895, at London&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre in 1889, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg in 1896-97, at the Paris Opera in 1897, and at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1895 and 1901. (During his London seasons, he also sang privately for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle.)

Orchestral conductors of the calibre of Franco Faccio, Luigi Mancinelli and Arturo Toscanini partnered Tamagno during his heyday, and he appeared opposite some of the most illustrious sopranos, baritones and basses in operatic history. Veteran opera-goers regarded Tamagno as being the legitimate successor to Enrico Tamberlik (1820–1889), the dominant Italian heroic tenor of the mid-19th century, while Jean de Reszke (1850–1925) was widely considered to be the finest of his tenorial coevals. An elegant lyric-dramatic tenor of the French school, de Reszke&#x27;s repertoire overlapped Tamagno&#x27;s to some extent, and although he could never outsing his Italian rival, he had a rounder voice and a suaver stage presence. He was also the foremost male exponent of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas to be heard on the stages of London and New York during the late-Victorian Era. Tamagno, however, refused to perform Wagnerian works, even in Italian translation; he believed that the tessitura of the music written for Wagner&#x27;s tenor heroes lay too low to suit his vocal range.

Tamagno lived long enough to witness the rise to fame of the young Enrico Caruso (1873–1921). He admired Caruso&#x27;s ability, predicting as far back as 1898 that Caruso would go on to become the number-one Italian tenor of the 20th century. As M. J. Phillips-Matz observes in her 2002 Puccini biography, Tamagno and Caruso actually appeared on the same stage in February 1901, during a concert at La Scala. The concert had been organised by Toscanini as a commemorative tribute to the recently deceased Verdi. (In it, Tamagno sang an extract from &quot;La forza del destino&quot; and Caruso led the quartet from &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.) Opera commentator Michael Scott states that Tamagno gave his last performance as Otello in Rome in 1903, when he starred in a gala production mounted for Kaiser Wilhelm II.

A single father who never married, Tamagno possessed an affable personality in addition to a shrewd business brain and a careful attitude to money. Soprano Nellie Melba&#x27;s most recent biographer, Ann Blainey, recounts how Melba reacted to Tamagno&#x27;s penny-pinching when she twice encountered demonstrations of it during the 1894-1895 New York Met season:

&quot;His astounding voice was said to have &#x27;the metallic penetration of an eight-inch [artillery] shell&#x27;, but at heart, he remained a simple peasant, and his peasant-like parsimony was a source of amusement. One night Melba and Jean de Reszke watched open-mouthed as he pocketed the after-dinner candies and souvenired a bunch of orchids from the table. Soon after, at a lunch, Melba saw him gather up his neighbour&#x27;s uneaten cutlets and wrap them in a newspaper. He said they were for his dog, but Melba guessed they were for his own dinner.&quot; (See &quot;I Am Melba&quot;, Black Inc. Books, Melbourne, Australia, 2008, p. 149.)

Tamagno had a bullish physique but a chronic cardiac ailment caused his health to deteriorate during the early 1900s. Although this ailment forced him to quit the operatic stage, he continued to give recitals and appear in concerts, the final one of which was held in Ostend, Belgium, in 1904. He sang briefly in public for the last time in March the following year and withdrew to the tranquillity of a villa in Varese, Lombardy, that he had owned since 1885 and had remodelled extensively. Tamagno&#x27;s medical condition failed to improve, however, and he suffered a heart attack while at the villa. He was confined to his bed, experienced a relapse and died on 31 August 1905, aged 54. His body lies interred in an elaborate stone mausoleum at Turin&#x27;s General Cemetery.

Tamagno&#x27;s beloved daughter Margherita, who had been born out of wedlock, and for whom he cared from her birth, writing to her throughout his career and her childhood incredibly moving letters, inherited his considerable estate, according to biographer Ugo Piavano. Piavano&#x27;s definitive biography, &quot;Otello Fu: La Vera Vita di Francesco Tamagno, il &quot;tenore-cannone&quot;&quot;, was published in Milan in 2005 by Rugginenti Editore to mark the 100th anniversary of the singer&#x27;s death. Both Volume One of Michael Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Record of Singing&quot; (published by Duckworth, London, 1977) and J. B. Steane&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Tradition: 70 Years of Singing on Record&quot; (Duckworth, London, 1974) contain evaluations of Tamagno&#x27;s voice and artistry. Furthermore, the Teatro Regio di Torino has acquired many of Tamagno&#x27;s costumes and other items relating to his operatic career, while his butterfly collection can be viewed in Varese at the Villa Mirabello.

== Recordings ==
Tamagno&#x27;s intensely bright, steel-tipped voice with its stentorian timbre, open production, vigorous (but never disruptive) vibrato and incisive declamation is preserved on two batches of technologically primitive recordings of operatic items. They were made during February 1903 at Tamagno&#x27;s holiday retreat in Ospedaletti and during April 1904 at a &#x27;studio&#x27; in Rome.

The British Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company, HMV/EMI&#x27;s predecessor, produced all of Tamagno&#x27;s recordings (issued in the US by the Victor Talking Machine Company), which were released on shellac discs 10 or 12 inches in diameter and play correctly at speeds in the range of 73 to 77 rpm (the 78 rpm standard was not established until the 1920s). It dispatched one of its best engineers, Fred Gaisberg, to Italy to handle the recording sessions. (Such sessions could be a daunting experience for singers of Tamagno&#x27;s generation, who were accustomed to performing before an audience in an opera house environment.) The company paid Tamagno a cash advance of 2,000 pounds sterling to make his first lot of recordings. He also received royalties from the company for every individually numbered, custom-labelled pressing that sold. Roland Gelatt&#x27;s revised edition of &quot;The Fabulous Phonograph&quot; (Collier Books, New York, 1977, p. 119) asserts that Tamagno&#x27;s recording contract, signed in December 1902, was the first to embody &quot;the royalty principle&quot;.

Gelatt states that Tamagno approved 19 recordings from his Ospedaletti session for release to the public. They went on sale in April 1903 and were heavily advertised in the press, with Tamagno billed as the world&#x27;s greatest tenor. Buyers were charged one pound sterling, or its equivalent in other currencies, per disc; in comparison, Caruso&#x27;s early 10-inch discs (made in Italy the previous year) sold for just 10 shillings or an equivalent amount of money. The amount charged for each of Tamagno&#x27;s discs represented at least a week&#x27;s wages for the common man and for that outlay, he would receive a single-sided product, sometimes containing less than two minutes of music. Clearly, Tamagno&#x27;s recordings were aimed at upper-crust customers, as were those made by such eminent contemporaries of his as Nellie Melba, Adelina Patti, Pol Plançon and Mattia Battistini.

The small group of composers featured on Tamagno&#x27;s combined recorded output of 1903 and 1904 comprises Giacomo Meyerbeer, Camille Saint-Saëns, Jules Massenet, de Lara, Giordano, Rossini and, naturally enough, Verdi. Apart from &quot;Otello&quot;, the operas from which he elected to record arias, in multiple takes, were&quot; Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; (&quot;Guglielmo Tell&quot;), &quot;Le prophète&quot; (&quot;Il profeta&quot;), &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; (&quot;Sansone e Dalila&quot;), &quot;Hérodiade&quot;, &quot;Messaline&quot; and &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;.

When he stepped before the recording horn, Tamagno was in poor health and semi-retirement after a long and demanding career. Consequently, his voice, although still astonishingly powerful and kept under firm technical control, was no longer at its peak, though the recording technology of the time was almost certainly not equal to the task of capturing the full breadth of Tamagno&#x27;s ability at the time.

Potter pays tribute to Tamagno&#x27;s vocal attributes in his book about the history of tenor singing, averring that his &quot;recorded legacy&quot; is &quot;a priceless connection with Verdi&quot; while Steane, writing in &quot;The Grand Tradition&quot; (pp. 19–23), praises Tamagno&#x27;s discs as &quot;artistic and devoted performances by a singer of exceptional gifts&quot; with a &quot;great voice&quot;. Scott declares in &quot;The Record of Singing&quot; (pp. 131–133) that Tamagno&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; recordings are &quot;invaluable historically&quot; with the Esultate in particular displaying &quot;amazing force&quot; and all of them exhibiting an &quot;intensity of utterance&quot; that is &quot;unique&quot;. Indeed, Henry Pleasants, author of &quot;The Great Singers&quot;, goes so far as to say that the &quot;searing despair&quot; of Tamagno&#x27;s version of Otello&#x27;s death aria, Niun mi tema, &quot;is possibly unmatched by anything else on wax&quot; (Macmillan Publishing, revised edition, London, 1983, pp. 252–254).

Symposium Records has released a two-CD anthology of Tamagno&#x27;s published and unpublished recordings (catalogue number 1186/87), while an extensive selection of them was issued on the Pearl/Opal label (CD 9846) in 1990. Those wanting to hear Tamagno in a broader context may wish to consult EMI&#x27;s three-CD &quot;La Scala Edition, Volume One, 1878-1914&quot; (CHS 7 64860 2). This edition contains four Tamagno tracks in expertly re-mastered transfers plus recordings made by a number of his colleagues, including baritone Victor Maurel, the creator of the role of Iago in &quot;Otello&quot;, and bass Francesco Navarini, the creator of the role of Lodovico in the same opera.

Of more specialist interest (but bringing us closer to Tamagno in recording quality) has been a 2007 release of all of Tamagno&#x27;s extant 12-inch records on high-quality vinyl discs (pressed from the original metal &quot;masters&quot;/parts found in a German archive) by the United Kingdom firm Historic Masters. This was followed in 2012 by all the ten-inch recordings.

All but one of Tamagno&#x27;s recordings (published or not) have been found. The Historic Masters boxed set is accompanied by a biographical essay written by Michael Aspinall, who also discusses Tamagno&#x27;s discography and appraises his vocal technique. The set contains, among other things, a recently discovered recording of the Oath Duet from &quot;Otello&quot; (&#x27;Si pel ciel&#x27;) and an aria from &quot;Messaline&quot; that was previously known only from a private test pressing once belonging to Tamagno. The baritone on the &quot;Otello&quot; duet is anonymous, but Aspinall believes it might be Tamagno&#x27;s younger brother, Giovanni, who had a minor singing career. Aspinall concludes his essay thus: &quot;Tamagno is one of the most charismatic and communicative singers ever to record his voice for the wonderment of future generations ... The privilege of listening to the complete recordings of Tamagno helps us to realise his immense stature among the great names of music drama.&quot;

<doc id="409888" wikidata="Q993904" url="?curid=409888" title="Orizaba">
<text>Orizaba (, Otomi: ) is a city and municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz. It is located 20 km west of its sister city Córdoba, and is adjacent to Río Blanco and Ixtaczoquitlán, on Federal Highways 180 and 190. The city had a 2020 census population of 120,500 and is almost coextensive with its small municipality, with only a few small areas outside the city. The municipality, with an area of 27.97 km2 (10.799 sq mi), had a population of 123,182. While the metropolitan area of Orizaba has a population of 462,261 as 2020.

In the town of Ixhuatlancillo north of Orizaba, and in a large mountainous area to the south (the Sierra de Zongolica), live many thousands of people who speak a variant of Nahuatl which is often called Orizaba Nahuatl (ISO code nlv).

==Naming==
It is generally understood that the name &quot;Orizaba&quot; comes from a Hispanicized pronunciation of the Nahuatl name &quot;Āhuilizāpan&quot; [&quot;a: wi li sa: pan&quot;], which means &quot;place of pleasing waters.&quot; Another possibility, however, is the word Harish (Jerez de la Frontera, Andalusia, in 16th-century Spanish pronunciation), this place being the hometown of the first Spanish settlers (1521) of Orizaba. Harish or—in a simplified form—Ariz, with the addition (under the influence of the Arabic language) of the gentilic &quot;i&quot; and/or with the ending &quot;aba&quot;, meaning fortification, would have become Ariziba or Arizaba, from which Orizaba would have derived. (The word Harish—in turn—is, according to some authors, linked to the capital of Tartessus and could refer to the biblical Tarshish. Its Semitic meaning could be &quot;trading post&quot; or &quot;foundry site&quot;, since Tartessus was a major Phoenician center of tin commerce and bronze production.)

==Geography==

The town lies at 1,200 m. (4000 ft.), at the confluence of the Río Blanco with several tributaries, including the Río Orizaba, near the mouth of a large valley heading westward into the eastern Sierra Madre Oriental. This location, at the bottom of the ascent into the mountains, is an important transition point along what has been for centuries the main trade route between Mexico City and Veracruz on the Gulf Coast. in 1938 the upper Río Blanco watershed was designated Cañón del Río Blanco National Park.

Orizaba has an unusually wet dry-winter subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cwb).

The climate is generally pleasant, though often cloudy and rainy, and the soil of the Orizaba valley is extraordinarily fertile. Overlooking the valley from the north is the Pico de Orizaba (Citlaltépetl), a volcano that, at 5,636 m. (18,490 ft.), is the highest mountain in Mexico and third highest in North America.

==History==

=== Prehistory and conquest ===
Orizaba was already an important town at the time of the Spanish conquest, and it was in Orizaba that La Malinche, Hernán Cortés&#x27;s interpreter and mistress, was married to the Spanish gentleman Juan Jaramillo. A plaque at the Temple of &quot;The Immaculate Conception&quot; in Huiloapan commemorates this event.

=== Colonial period ===
During the colonial period, Orizaba became an important city. On January 27, 1774, the Spanish king Carlos III granted town (&quot;villa&quot;) status to Orizaba, and on November 29, 1830 Orizaba was declared a city.

=== Independence war ===
In October 1812, José María Morelos captured the city for the insurgent army. In 1821 to the end of the war, Agustín de Iturbide was in Orizaba before and after the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba in the neighbor city.

=== Independent period ===

When Lucas Alamán established, in 1836, the first textile factory (&quot;Cocolapan&quot;) of Orizaba, the city started its economic life as an industrial city.

In 1839, the newspaper &quot;La Luz&quot; was created and Veracruz Governor Francisco Hernández y Hernández gave the name of &quot;Veracruz-Llave&quot; (remembering General Ignacio de la Llave, who was born in Orizaba) to the state.

On May 8, 1874, Orizaba was declared the capital city of Veracruz by Governor Apolinar Castillo, but in 1878 the status was transferred to Xalapa.

During the rule of Porfirio Díaz, Orizaba was declared the most educated city in the state.

In the late years of Díaz&#x27;s government, there was an important workers&#x27; strike in Cananea. Another important strike, in Río Blanco, took place in Orizaba and was an important prelude to the Mexican Revolution.

The US transport ship USS Orizaba (ID-1536), active in both World Wars, was named after the city.

==Demographics==
With a population of 123,182 inhabitants in the municipality as 2020, Orizaba is the seventh biggest municipality in Veracruz. There are 5 localities, Orizaba City, the municipal seat, and Villas de la Hacienda are classified as urban. Orizaba City contains more than 97 % of the municipal population (120,500 hab,), meanwhile Villas de la Haciendad recorded a population of 2,597 hab. The other three localities: Venustiano Carranza (61 hab.), Vicente Guerrero (18 hab.) and El Vaquero (6 hab.) are classified as rural. 4,452 inhabitants in Orizaba are classified as living in indigenous homes, 1,883 of which speakes an indigenous language.

Orizaba is the seat of a metropolitan area, with another 11 municipalities: Atzacan, Camerino Z. Mendoza, Huiloapan de Cuauhtémoc, Ixhuatlancillo, Ixtaczoquitlán, Maltrata, Mariano Escobedo, Nogales, Rafael Delgado, Río Blanco and Tlilapan. The metro area recorded a population of 462,221 inhabitants as 2020, the fourth largest metro area in the state.

== Economy ==

The Orizaba&#x27;s area (including the municipalities of Ixtaczoquitlán, Río Blanco, Nogales and Cd. Mendoza) economy has grown significantly in the last years due to the safety of the area, being of great confidence for national and foreign investors who wants to establish in a safe place. Another important reason is the presence of recognised Universities like Universidad Veracruzana, Instituto Tecnológico de Orizaba or Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Central de Veracruz en Córdoba.
The industry is mainly focused in the following areas: breweries, paper, cement, pharmaceutical, iron and steel sector, soft drinks and food, leather and shoemaker companies among others. Also in the last years the commercial area experiments a significant growth due to the opening of new Malls &amp; Major Retailers.
It is one of the cheapest cities to live and invest in México, as Mercer consultory published in the &quot;Estudio de costo de la vida nacional 2012&quot;; this study includes 42 localities of México, and was done comparing 182 products and services.

The inquiry also disclose that Orizaba&#x27;s Valley will grow 10% in 2013, due to the lack of pollution, existence of enough water and other points like price of housing.

==Main sights==

The old city hall &quot;El Palacio de Hierro&quot; (The Iron Palace) in the centre of the city was designed by Gustave Eiffel and built from 1891 to 1894. Built with 600 tons of steel, its parts were shipped from Belgium during the &quot;Porfiriato&quot; (the government of Porfirio Díaz, 1876–1911), to be assembled in Orizaba. The palace cost 100,000 pesos (gold), equivalent to about 21.3 million pesos or 1.1 million USD as of 2019. Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas loaned the money to the city, and had to pay the additional cost of unloading the palace from the port and having it reassembled at its present location, the Plaza de Armas. Don Manuel died on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1899 without having received any repayment from the city for his loan. He had also donated the land where the present Cathedral of Orizaba and the adjacent &quot;El Mercado&quot; shopping center stand. El Palacio de Hierro served as the City Hall until the city considered that it was not large enough for the growing needs of the local government, and moved to its present location.

Orizaba has an important industrial life. There is, for example, the Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, a brewery established in 1896 in Orizaba.
Other attractions for visitors include:
* The Teleférico or cable-car to the top of Cerro Borrego, which offers views of Pico de Orizaba. A trail to the top of Cerro Borrego is also available. In either case the mountain is most visible in the morning when the eastern sun lights it.

<doc id="409889" wikidata="Q141" url="?curid=409889" title="Timbits">
<text>Timbits is the name of a bite-sized dough confection sold at the Canadian-based franchise Tim Hortons. Almost an exact equivalent to the American &quot;donut hole&quot;, however they are baked, rather than fried. They were introduced in April 1976.

==Name and variations==

The word Timbit is a play on the word &quot;tidbit&quot; (a delicate bit or morsel of food). As of 2009, they are available in various flavors that differ from store to store. Flavors include chocolate-glazed, jelly-filled, dutchie, honey dip, sour-cream-glazed, old-fashioned plain, old-fashion-glazed, blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, lemon, apple cider, orange-tangerine, creamy caramel, cherry cake, birthday cake, honey cruller, pumpkin spice, toasted coconut, and apple fritter. For Tim Hortons&#x27;s 50th anniversary, &quot;birthday cake&quot; doughnuts and Timbits were sold for a limited time and given out for free on May 17, 2014- the Timbits being available first in the United States.

Other doughnut chains in Canada and the United States sell virtually identical products, often called &quot;doughnut holes&quot;. For instance, the American coffee and donut company Dunkin Donuts, sells &quot;munchkins&quot;. The majority of Canadians generally use the Timbits trademark to designate the product, while French-speaking Canadians prefer to use the generic term &quot;trous de beigne&quot;. In the francophone Tim Hortons locations, however, they are still referred to as Timbits.

== Timbiebs ==
In November 2021, Tim Hortons announced a collaboration with Canadian pop star Justin Bieber to release three limited time flavours along with collaborative merchandise. The November 29th release saw chocolate white fudge, sour cream chocolate chip, and birthday cake waffle Timbiebs become available in Canadian and American Tim Hortons. Participating Tim Hortons franchises also sold the Timbiebs branded tote bag, toque, and fanny pack. A French and English television ad also released at the time of the announcement in mid-November.

According to Tim Hortons Chief Marketing Office Hope Bagozzi, the collaboration talks began after Bieber took to Instagram discussing the coffee chain’s lid change in 2019. Bieber said &quot;Doing a Tim Hortons collab has always been a dream of mine&quot; in a statement following the collaboration announcement, and that Timbiebs were his “go-to” Tim Hortons item.

The collaboration garnered media and fan attention, with many expressing their love for the new flavours. Then-CEO of Restaurant Brands International, Tim Hortons’ parent company, José Cil called the collaboration “one of the more successful traffic-driving initiatives in recent memory” which generated “unprecedented social engagement” in RBI’s Q4 2022 results.

<doc id="409890" wikidata="Q1009337" url="?curid=409890" title="Geolibertarianism">
<text>Geolibertarianism is a political and economic ideology that integrates libertarianism with Georgism. It favors a taxation system based (as in Georgism) on income derived from land and natural resources instead of on labor, coupled with a minimalist model of government, as in libertarianism. The term was coined by the late economist Fred Foldvary in 1981. 

Geolibertarians recognize the right to private ownership of land, but only if fair recompense is paid to the community for the loss of access to that land. Some geolibertarians broaden out the tax base to include resource depletion, environmental damage, and other ancillaries to land use. 

A succinct summary of this philosophy can be found in Thomas Paine&#x27;s 1797 pamphlet &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;: &quot;Men did not make the earth. It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds&quot;.

==Overview==
Geolibertarians maintain that geographical space and raw natural resources—any assets that qualify as land by economic definition—are rivalrous goods to be considered common property, or more accurately unowned, which all individuals share an equal human right to access, not capital wealth to be privatized fully and absolutely. Therefore, landholders ought to pay compensation according to the rental value set by the free market, absent any improvements, to the community for the civil right of usufruct (that is, legally recognized exclusive possession with restrictions on property abuse) or otherwise fee simple title with no such restrictions. Ideally, the taxing of a site would be administered only after it has been determined that the privately captured economic rent from the land exceeds the title-holder&#x27;s equal share of total land value in the jurisdiction.

On this proposal, rent is collected not for the mere occupancy or use of land, as neither the community nor the state rightfully owns the commons, but rather as an objectively assessed indemnity due for the legal right to exclude others from that land. Some geolibertarians also support Pigovian taxes on pollution and severance taxes to regulate natural resource depletion and compensatory fees with ancillary positive environmental effects on activities which negatively impact land values. They take the standard right-libertarian position that each individual is naturally entitled to the fruits of their labor as exclusive private property as opposed to produced goods being owned collectively by society or by the government acting to represent society, and that a person&#x27;s &quot;labor, wages, and the products of labor&quot; should not be taxed. Along with non-Georgists in the libertarian movement, they also advocate the law of equal liberty, supporting &quot;full civil liberties, with no crimes unless there are victims who have been invaded.&quot;

Geolibertarians are generally influenced by the Georgist single tax movement of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, but the ideas behind it pre-date Henry George and can be found in different forms in the political writings of John Locke, the early agrarian socialism of English True Levellers or Diggers such as Gerrard Winstanley, the French Physiocrats (especially Quesnay and Turgot), British classical economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, French liberal economists Jean-Baptiste Say and Frédéric Bastiat, American Revolutionary writers Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine, English Radical land reformer Thomas Spence, American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker, as well as British classical liberal philosophers John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. Prominent geolibertarians since George have included Old Right social critics Albert Jay Nock and Frank Chodorov. Other libertarians who have expressed support for the land value tax as an incremental reform include Milton Friedman, Karl Hess, John Hospers and United States Libertarian Party co-founder David Nolan.

== Property rights ==

In continuity with the classical economic and liberal traditions, geolibertarians contend that land is an independent factor of production, that it is the common inheritance of all humanity and that the justice of private property is derived from an individual&#x27;s right to the fruits of his or her labor. Since land by economic definition is not the product of human labor, its ownership cannot be justified by appealing to natural human rights. Geolibertarians recognize the individual civil right to secure exclusive possession of land only on the condition that if the land has accrued economic rent, its full rental value be paid to the community deprived of equal access. This non-distortionary system of taxation, it is argued, has the effects of returning the value that belongs to all members of society and encouraging landholders to use only as much land as they need, leaving unneeded land for others to occupy, use and develop.

A succinct summary of the geolibertarian philosophy is Thomas Paine&#x27;s assertion in his 1797 pamphlet &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;: &quot;Men did not make the earth. It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds&quot;. On the other hand, John Locke wrote that private land ownership should be praised as long as its product was not left to spoil and there was &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others&quot;. When this Lockean proviso is violated, the land earns rental value. Some geolibertarians argue that &quot;enough, and as good left&quot; is a practical impossibility in a city setting where location is paramount. This implies that in any urban social environment Locke&#x27;s proviso requires the collection and equal distribution of ground rent. Geolibertarians sometimes dispute the received interpretation of Locke&#x27;s homestead principle outlined in his &quot;Second Treatise of Government&quot; as concerning the justice of initial acquisition of property in land, opting instead for a view ostensibly more compatible with the proviso which considers Locke to be describing the process by which property is created from land through the application of labor.

This strict definition of private property as the fruit of a person&#x27;s labor leads geolibertarians to advocate free markets in capital goods, consumer goods, and services, in addition to the protection of workers&#x27; rights to their full earnings.

== Policy proposals ==
Geolibertarians generally support allocating land rent from private landholders to all community members by way of a land value tax as proposed by Henry George and others before him.

Geolibertarians desire to see the revenue from land value capture cover only necessary administrative costs and fund only those public services which are essential for a governing body to secure and enforce rights to life, liberty and estate—civic protections which increase the aggregate land rent within the jurisdiction and thereby serve to finance themselves—the surplus being equally distributed as an unconditional dividend to each citizen. Thus, the value of the land is returned to the residents who produce it, but who by practical necessity and legal privilege have been deprived of equal access while the poor and disadvantaged benefit from a reliable social safety net unencumbered by bureaucracy or intrusive means-testing. Some geolibertarians claim the reasoning behind taxing land values likewise justifies a complementary pollution tax for degrading the shared value of the natural commons. The common and inelastic character of the radio wave spectrum (which also falls under land as an economic category) is understood to justify the taxation of its exclusive use, as well.

American economist and political philosopher Fred Foldvary coined the term geo-libertarianism in a so-titled article appearing in &quot;Land&amp;Liberty&quot;. In the case of what Foldvary terms &quot;geoanarchism&quot;, which he describes as the most radically decentralized and scrupulously voluntarist form of geolibertarianism, Foldvary theorizes that ground rents would be collected by private agencies and persons would have the opportunity to secede from associated geocommunities—thereby opting out of their protective and legal services—if desired.

<text>Lorenzo Salvi (4 May 1810 – 16 January 1879) was an Italian operatic tenor who had a major international opera career during the nineteenth century. He was particularly associated with the operas of Gaetano Donizetti and Giuseppe Verdi; notably singing lead roles is several world premieres by both composers.

==Biography==
Born in Ancona, Salvi studied under Bonaccini in Naples before making his professional opera debut as Cam in the world premiere of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Il diluvio universale&quot; on 28 February 1830 at the Teatro San Carlo. This was followed by several appearance at the opera house in Zadar in 1830–1831. He then joined the roster of principal singers at the Teatro Valle in Rome, singing there through 1832. While with the company he sang several leading tenor roles, including the title role in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; opposite Maria Malibran as Desdemona and Fernando in the world premiere of Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Il furioso all&#x27;isola di San Domingo&quot; (1833).

Over the next two decades Salvi was one of Italy&#x27;s leading tenors, singing roles with most of the country&#x27;s major opera houses. On 21 August 1836 he portrayed Daniele in the world premiere of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Betly&quot; at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples. He went on to sing in two more Donizetti premieres, the title role in &quot;Gianni di Parigi&quot; (1839, La Scala), and Oliverio in &quot;Adelia&quot; (1841, Teatro Apollo).
From 1836 until 1840 Salvi had a number of lauded successes at the Teatro Carlo Felice. A particular triumph was the role of Arnold in that theatre&#x27;s first mounting of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; (1840). From 1839 until 1842 Salvi was a regular performer at La Scala. While there he notably sang leading roles in the world premieres of the first two operas composed by Giuseppe Verdi, portraying Riccardo in &quot;Oberto&quot; on 17 November 1839 and Edoardo in &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot; on 5 September 1840. Other La Scala highlights included an appearance in the original production of Federico Ricci&#x27;s &quot;Un duello sotto Richelieu&quot; (1839) and the role of Tonio in the house premiere of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; (1840).

In 1843 Salvi made his first appearances in France at the Théâtre-Italien as Edgardo in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and Riccardo in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot;. From 1847–1850 he sang annually as a guest artist at the Royal Opera, London, where he had tremendous successes portraying heroes from Donizetti and Bellini operas. He also traveled to North America several times during his career, notably performing in a number of operas at Niblo&#x27;s Garden in Manhattan. In 1851 he made a lengthy concert tour of the United States with Swedish soprano Jenny Lind. He also took part in the first performance of the Mexican national anthem on September 15, 1854.

Salvi was married to Italian soprano Adelina Spech-Salvi who also had an important opera career. After their retirement from the stage, the couple moved to Bologna and worked as singing teachers. Salvi died in Bologna in 1879 at the age of 68.

<text>Francisco Gabilondo Soler (October 6, 1907, Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico – December 14, 1990, Texcoco, State of Mexico) was a Mexican composer and performer of children&#x27;s songs. He recorded and performed those songs under the name of &quot;Cri-Cri: El Grillito Cantor&quot; (&quot;Cri-Cri: The Little Singing Cricket&quot;).

==Biography==

Gabilondo was born in the city of Orizaba, Veracruz. Both his parents were children of Spanish immigrants to Mexico. During his childhood he read the stories of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, as well as the adventure stories of such writers as Jules Verne and Emilio Salgari. He also taught himself to play the pianola. In 1928, he entered the National Observatory of Mexico to study astronomy, but his studies were cut short by a lack of resources. Before dedicating himself to music full-time, he practiced boxing, bullfighting and swimming. He also worked for a time as a linotypist.

When he was 25 years old, he began performing as a professional musician, interpreting humorous subjects of his inspiration. At first he played in public bath houses. He entered the new field of radio to become one of the main figures in the &quot;Golden Age of Mexican Radio&quot;, beginning with humorous and social criticism programs, using the sobriquet &quot;El Guasón del Teclado&quot; (The Joker of the Keyboard). He used the experiences of his childhood to write some children&#x27;s songs, and on October 15, 1934, he appeared, for the first time, on Radio Station XEW in Mexico City, singing many of the songs he had previously written. This marked the first performance in his persona as &#x27;Cri-Cri&#x27;. The first songs to be played were &quot;El ratón vaquero&quot; (The cowboy mouse), &quot;Los mosquitos trompeteros&quot; (The trumpeter mosquitoes), &quot;Negrito Sandía&quot; (Little Black Boy Watermelon), &quot;Cucurumbé&quot;, and &quot;La Muñeca fea&quot; (The ugly doll).

Between 1941 and 1944 he served in the Mexican merchant marine travelling around South America. He returned to Radio Station XEW in 1944 and continued his shows there for the next 28 years. He retired in 1962.

Despite never finishing his astronomical studies, he maintained a lifelong passion for the field, being inducted into the Sociedad Astronómica de México (Astronomical Society of Mexico) and having an observatory built in Tultepec. A film about his life was made in 1963 called &quot;Cri-Cri, el grillito cantor&quot; starring Ignacio López Tarso and Marga López.

In 1984, he was honored in a special ceremony dedicated to him, where he was just accompanied by the piano. Francisco Gabilondo Soler &quot;The Singing Cricket&quot;, died on December 14, 1990, of cardiac disease, at the age of 83 years.

==Career==
Francisco Gabilondo Soler was 25 years old when he started his professional musical career.

At first he did not write children&#x27;s songs, but he soon realized that most of his fans were children, so he decided to concentrate his efforts on writing songs for children. Gabilondo Soler composed a total of 210 songs, of which three are unaccounted for. Almost all his songs are stories that teach values to children. He had the tendency to give animals and things human-like characteristics, and wrote songs about dolls, animals and toys who had something special about them that separated them from the rest.

On October 15, 1934, he performed on the XEW radio for the first time, singing his own songs. &quot;CRI-CRI&quot; the singing cricket was born that day. In 1944 Gabilondo Soler created his own radio show on XEW where he played his songs for people of all ages.

Gabilondo&#x27;s songs have also been recorded by opera singer Plácido Domingo, French singer Mireille Mathieu, and Argentine singer Libertad Lamarque, among other world-famous performers.

He recorded &quot;Cri-Cri, El Grillito Cantor&quot; (1956), &quot;Homenaje a Cri-Cri&quot; (1957), &quot;Mas Canciones del Grillito Cantor&quot; (1958), &quot;Los Amigos de Cri-Cri&quot; (1959), &quot;Cuentos y Canciones de Cri-Cri&quot; (1963), &quot;Todo el Año con Cri-Cri&quot; (1963) &quot;30 Aniversario de Cri-Cri&quot; (1964), &quot;Conejo Blas a Dónde Vas&quot; (1964) and several other collections of his songs.

In 1979, &quot;El Chavo&quot; paid tribute to Francisco Soler with the song &quot;Gracias Cri Cri&quot;.

==Style==

Francisco Gabilondo Soler was able to mix a variety of styles in his songs, including the fox trot, tango (such as in the song &quot;Che Araña&quot;), U.S. country music (&quot;El Raton Vaquero&quot;) and Mexican ranchera music, always employing remarkably imaginative orchestration and rhythm. Cri-Cri&#x27;s songs, of which he wrote both the music and the lyrics, became fables of sorts that had both an educational and an entertainment value. Some of his songs became so popular over the decades that a few of his characters have become forever engrained in Mexican popular culture, such as &quot;La Muñeca Fea&quot; (&quot;The Ugly Doll&quot;), a song that tells the story of an old broken doll who is sadly forgotten in an attic and is befriended by a mouse. Cri-Cri was a historically unique musician due to the multi-generational endurance of his songs and lyrics.

===Songs===
His songs have been translated into many languages including French, English, Portuguese and Russian. More than songs, Francisco Gabilondo Soler created stories with music, making children all over the world dream with them.

==Miscellaneous==
In 2007, for the centennial celebration of his birth, the dance company at the Palacio de Bellas Artes prepared a show based on his work. The choreography uses his most representative songs, and the scenes are filled with images of the characters from songs such as &quot;El ratón vaquero&quot; (The cowboy mouse), &quot;Los mosquitos trompeteros&quot; (The trumpeter mosquitoes) and &quot;La muñeca fea&quot; (The ugly doll). This homage to Cri-Crí was set to run through 2008.

<text>The National Democratic Alliance (NDA; ISO: &quot;Rāṣṭrīya Lokatāntrik Gaṭhabandhan&quot;) is an Indian big tent multi-party political alliance, led by the country&#x27;s biggest political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was founded on 15 May 1998. It currently has a majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and controls the Government of India as well as the governments of 19 out of 28 Indian states and 2 out of 3 Union territories with legislative assemblies. 

Its first chairman was then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee. L. K. Advani, the former Deputy Prime Minister, took over as chairman in 2004 and served until 2014, and Amit Shah has been the chairman since 2014. The coalition ruled from 1998 to 2004. The alliance returned to power in the 2014 general elections with a combined vote share of 38.5%. Its leader Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. In the 2019 general election, the alliance further increased its tally to 353 seats with combined vote share of 45.43%. The alliance lost 60 seats in the 2024 general election, but retained enough to form a coalition government, a first in over 10 years. On 7 June 2024, Modi confirmed the support of 293 MPs to Droupadi Murmu, the President of India. This marked Modi&#x27;s third term as Prime Minister and his first time heading a coalition government, with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.

== History ==
The NDA was formed in May 1998 as a coalition to contest the general elections. The main aim of the NDA was to form an anti-Indian National Congress coalition. It was led by the BJP, and included several regional parties, including the Samata Party and the AIADMK, as well as Shiv Sena, but Shiv Sena broke away from the alliance in 2019 to join the Maha Vikas Aghadi with Congress and the NCP. Samata Party also broke away from alliance in 2003 after formation of Janta Dal (United). The Shiv Sena was the only member which shared the Hindutva ideology of the BJP. After the election, it was able to muster a slim majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party, allowing Atal Bihari Vajpayee to return as prime minister.

The government collapsed within a year because the AIADMK withdrew its support. After the entry of a few more regional parties, the NDA proceeded to win the 1999 elections with a larger majority. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for a third time, and this time served a full five-year term.

The NDA called elections in early 2004, six months ahead of schedule. Its campaign was based around the slogan of &quot;India Shining&quot; which attempted to depict the NDA government as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country. However, the NDA suffered a defeat, winning only a 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress, with Manmohan Singh succeeding Vajpayee as prime minister. Commentators have argued that the NDA&#x27;s defeat was due to a failure to reach out to the rural masses. The scenario however changed quickly with the rise of Gujarat CM Narendra Modi who went on to become India&#x27;s PM from 2014 onwards.

== Structure ==
The National Democratic Alliance does not have a formal governing structure such as an executive board or politburo. It has been up to the leaders of the individual parties to make decisions on issues such as sharing of seats in elections, allocation of ministries and the issues that are raised in Parliament. Given the varied ideologies among the parties, there have been many cases of disagreement and split voting among the allies.

Owing to ill health, George Fernandes, who was the NDA convener until 2008, was discharged of his responsibility and replaced by Sharad Yadav, the then national president of the JD(U) political party. On 16 June 2013, the JD(U) left the coalition and Sharad Yadav resigned from the role of the NDA convener. Then the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu was made the NDA convener. Later in 2018, after the withdrawal of TDP from NDA the post of convenor was vacant. However NDA allies like LJP demanded the appointment of a convenor in 2019 for better coordination of the allies.

On 27 July 2017 JD(U) with the help of BJP formed the government in Bihar. Later, on 19 August 2017 JD(U) formally rejoined the NDA after 4 years.
