<text>The Republic F-105 Thunderchief is an American fighter-bomber that served with the United States Air Force from 1958 to 1984. Capable of Mach 2, it conducted the majority of strike bombing missions during the early years of the Vietnam War. It was originally designed as a single-seat, nuclear-attack aircraft; a two-seat Wild Weasel version was later developed for the specialized Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air missile sites. The F-105 was commonly known as the &quot;Thud&quot; by its crews. It is the only American aircraft to have been removed from combat due to high loss rates.

As a follow-on to the Mach 1 capable North American F-100 Super Sabre, the F-105 was also armed with missiles and a rotary cannon; however, its design was tailored to high-speed low-altitude penetration carrying a single nuclear weapon internally. First flown in 1955, the Thunderchief entered service in 1958. The single-engine F-105 could deliver a bomb load greater than some American heavy bombers of World War II such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The F-105 was one of the primary attack aircraft of the Vietnam War, with over 20,000 Thunderchief sorties flown. Out of the 833 produced, 382 aircraft were lost, including 62 operational (non-combat) losses. Although less agile than smaller MiG fighters, USAF F-105s were credited with 27.5 kills.

During the conflict, the single-seat F-105D was the primary aircraft delivering heavy bomb loads against the various military targets. Meanwhile, the two-seat F-105F and F-105G Wild Weasel variants became the first dedicated SEAD platforms, fighting against the Soviet-built S-75 Dvina (NATO reporting name: SA-2 &quot;Guideline&quot;) surface-to-air missiles. Two Wild Weasel pilots were awarded the Medal of Honor for attacking North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile sites, with one shooting down two MiG-17s the same day. The dangerous missions often required them to be the &quot;first in, last out&quot;, suppressing enemy air defenses while strike aircraft accomplished their missions and then left the area.

When the Thunderchief entered service it was the largest single-seat, single-engine combat aircraft in history, weighing approximately . It could exceed the speed of sound at sea level and reach Mach 2 at high altitude. The F-105 could carry up to of bombs and missiles. The Thunderchief was later replaced as a strike aircraft over North Vietnam by both the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the swing-wing General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark. However, the &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; variants of the F-105 remained in service until early 1984, at which point they were replaced by the specialized F-4G &quot;Wild Weasel V&quot;.

==Development==
===Design phase===
Republic Aviation started work on what would become the Thunderchief during 1951. It was conceived of as an internal project to produce a replacement for the RF-84F Thunderflash, which first used the characteristic wing-root air intakes to make room for cameras in the nose section. The design team led by Alexander Kartveli examined some 108 configurations before settling on a large, single-engine &quot;AP-63FBX&quot; (Advanced Project 63 Fighter Bomber, Experimental), specifically AP-63-31. The new aircraft was intended primarily for supersonic, low altitude penetration to deliver a single, internally carried nuclear bomb. The emphasis was placed on low-altitude speed and flight characteristics, range, and payload. The aircraft would be fitted with a large engine, and a relatively small wing with a high wing loading for a stable ride at low altitudes, and less drag at supersonic speeds. Traditional fighter attributes such as maneuverability were a secondary consideration.

During April 1952, Republic made its contractor proposal, which contained many of the features that the United States Air Force (USAF) would have liked the RF-84F to have been outfitted with had it been technically possible; one month later, the Air Staff endorsed its development over that of further developing the RF-84F. The USAF promptly issued Republic with an initial contract covering preproduction engineering, tooling, as well as the production of 199 aircraft, the first of which was to be operationally ready by 1955. However, by March 1953, the USAF had reduced the order to 37 fighter-bombers and nine tactical reconnaissance aircraft, citing the approaching end of the Korean War. In October 1953, the F-105 mock-up was inspected; no major changes were recommended. By this point, the aircraft had grown so large that the Allison J71 turbojet intended for it was abandoned in favor of the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J75. Anticipating a protracted development of the engine, it was expected that the first aircraft would use the smaller Pratt &amp; Whitney J57. Near the end of 1953, the entire program was suspended by the USAF due to a number of delays and uncertainties regarding the aircraft. However, on 28 June 1954, the USAF officially ordered 15 F-105s (two YF-105As, four YF-105Bs, six F-105Bs, and three RF-105Bs) under the Weapon System designation &quot;WS-306A&quot;.

===Initial flights===
On 22 October 1955, the YF-105A prototype made its maiden flight. After 22 hours of flight time, the prototype was returned to the factory for repairs after sustaining major damage. The second YF-105A made its first flight on 28 January 1956. Despite being powered by a less potent J57-P-25 engine with of afterburning thrust, the first prototype attained the speed of Mach 1.2 on its maiden flight. (The J75 was expected to generate with afterburner.) Both aircraft featured conventional wing root air intakes and slab-sided fuselages typical of the early jets; Republic viewed the prototypes as not being representative of the true capability of the aircraft due to numerous changes that were enacted prior to production. Specifically, insufficient power and aerodynamic problems with transonic drag, as well as Convair&#x27;s experience with their F-102, had led to a redesign of the fuselage to conform to the area rule, giving it a characteristic &quot;wasp waist&quot;. The F-105&#x27;s reworked air intake was designed with a unique forward-swept shape, which was derived from Antonio Ferri&#x27;s work on the proposed Republic XF-103 ramjet-powered interceptor. In combination with the distinctive forward-swept variable-geometry air intakes, which regulated airflow to the engine at supersonic speeds, and the J75 engine, this redesign enabled the F-105B to attain Mach 2.15.
During March 1956, the USAF placed a further order for 65 F-105Bs and 17 RF-105Bs. In order to conduct the nuclear mission, an MA-8 fire control system, AN/APG-31 ranging radar, and K-19 gunsight to allow for toss bombing were integrated. On 26 May 1956, the first pre-production YF-105B made its maiden flight. Five of the F-105C trainer variant were added to the procurement plan in June 1956, before being canceled during 1957. The RF-105 reconnaissance variant was canceled in July 1956. The first production F-105B was accepted by the USAF on 27 May 1957. In June 1957, Republic Aviation requested that the F-105 be named &quot;Thunderchief&quot;, continuing the sequence of the company&#x27;s Thunder-named aircraft: P-47 Thunderbolt, F-84 Thunderjet, and F-84F Thunderstreak. The USAF made this name official one month later.

===Later development===
To fulfill the USAF&#x27;s requirement for an all-weather attack aircraft, Republic proposed the F-105D variant during 1957. This version featured an enlarged nose and radome housing the AN/ASG-19 &quot;Thunderstick&quot; bombing/navigation system. The AN/ASG-19 was designed around the Autonetics R-14A radar, which operated in both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, and the AN/APN-131 Doppler navigation radar. In the cockpit, the F-105D featured vertical-tape instrument displays for adverse weather operation. The ability to carry the TX-43 nuclear weapon was also added. On account of these myriad changes, Republic noted the difficulty of using the same production line as had been used for the F-105B; production times would also be extended from 144 days to 214 days.

Development of the RF-105 reconnaissance model was restarted during the late 1950s, for a time based on the F-105D, before work on the model was cancelled for the final time on 23 December 1960. On 18 March 1959, the planned F-105E twin-seater was also cancelled due to its high cost; it was replaced on a one-to-one basis by additional F-105Ds. On 9 June 1959, the first F-105D took its maiden flight. Flight testing of the F-105D was somewhat less troubled than the less advanced F-105B, to the point where the D-model was ready for operational service ahead of its predecessor. Category II flight testing in late 1959 identified various key deficiencies on the F-105B, particularly with the MA-8 fire control system and autopilot of this variant. While eventually rectified successfully, it took time to develop and deploy appropriate modifications, putting the production programme further behind. By the start of 1960, none of the 56 F-105Bs that had been delivered were considered to be operationally ready.
At one point, there were plans in progress to procure in excess of 1,500 F-105Ds; however, production schedules continued to be missed, in part due to strikes by Republic&#x27;s workforce, that impacted the USAF&#x27;s plans for the type. Production of the F-105 was heavily impacted by the decision taken by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to equip no more than seven combat wings with the type. During November 1961, production of the type was cut in favor of the USAF adopting the Navy&#x27;s F-4 Phantom II, and in the longer term, the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark of the TFX program. While considerations towards reopening production of the F-105 were discussed in 1967, this interest did not ultimately see any such revival.

The final 143 Thunderchiefs built were of the two-seat F-105F trainer variant. Based on the F-105D, this model was 31 inches (79 cm) longer to provide room for the rear cockpit; otherwise, the aircraft had similar flight performance to the preceding F-105D. A total of 833 F-105s were completed before production ended in 1964. The F-105 had been designed for a short nuclear campaign, leading to shortcomings that became evident in a lengthy conventional war, such as a poor hydraulics layout and fuel tanks that were not self-sealing. Subsequent upgrades improved the reliability and weapons capacity of the existing F-105Ds. In response to the surface-to-air missile threat experienced in the skies above Vietnam, dozens of F-105Fs were converted into anti-radar &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; aircraft, culminating with the F-105G.

==Design==
===Overview===
The F-105 was a mid-wing monoplane with a 45° swept wing and tail surfaces. The single engine was fed by two intakes in the wing roots, leaving the nose free for a radome housing the multi-mode radar. Its fuselage provided room for of fuel and an internal bomb bay. The bomb bay measured by by ; it was originally designed to carry a single nuclear weapon but typically held an additional fuel tank. It featured four under-wing and one centerline pylon; the two inner wing and centerline pylons were capable of accepting fuel from drop tanks. Two outer dry stations were wired for missiles or bombs. One M61 Vulcan (initially designated &quot;T-171E3&quot;) 20 mm 6-barrel Gatling-style cannon was installed in the left side of the nose. A short-range AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile could be carried on each of the outer wing pylons.

The F-105 was designed primarily for low-level interdiction and its low-altitude speed was its greatest asset when dealing with enemy fighters such as the MiG-17/J-5s and MiG-21. The F-105 managed 27.5 air-to-air victories. Based on combat experience, the F-105D was updated with a better ejection seat, additional armor, improved gun sights, and Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) pods on the wings.

===Flight characteristics===
Former North American F-86 Sabre pilot Jerry Noel Hoblit recalled being in awe of the F-105&#x27;s size after seeing it for the first time; he could not manage to reach the air intake lip even with a running jump. The F-105 had a spacious cockpit with good visibility and layout (particularly after the introduction of &quot;tape&quot; instruments); the advanced electronics were easy to learn and operate. Takeoffs and landings were often performed in the range. The spoilers provided good roll control at all speeds and the distinctive four-petal airbrakes (which also opened slightly when the afterburner was engaged to allow for the larger flow of exhaust gases) were highly effective even at supersonic speeds. Loss of control due to a spin or complications of adverse yaw required deliberate effort from the pilot and spontaneous spin recovery was rapid.

The initial reaction of the fighter pilot community to their new aircraft was lukewarm. Between its massive dimensions and troubled early service life, the F-105 had garnered a number of uncomplimentary nicknames. In addition to the aforementioned &quot;Thud&quot;, nicknames included the &quot;Squat Bomber&quot;, &quot;Lead Sled&quot;, and the &quot;Hyper Hog&quot; and/or &quot;Ultra Hog&quot;. The latter two names arose from the F-105&#x27;s predecessors, the Republic F-84 Thunderjet and F-84F Thunderstreak, nicknamed &quot;Hog&quot; and &quot;Super Hog&quot;, respectively. According to F-105 pilots and crews, the &quot;Thud&quot; nickname was inspired by the character &quot;Chief Thunderthud&quot; from the &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; television series.

The aircraft&#x27;s offensive capabilities were sarcastically referred to as a &quot;Triple Threat&quot;—it could bomb you, strafe you, or fall on you. Positive aspects, such as the F-105&#x27;s responsive controls, strong performance at high speed and low altitude, and its outfit of electronics won over some pilots. For some, &quot;Thud&quot; was a term of endearment; retroactively the RF-84F Thunderflash became known as &quot;Thud&#x27;s Mother&quot;. F-105 pilot Colonel Jack Broughton said of the nickname: &quot;The Thud has justified herself, and the name that was originally spoken with a sneer has become one of utmost respect through the air fraternity&quot;.

===Special modifications===
====Commando Nail====
The rear cockpits of several two-seat F-105Fs were modified under project &quot;Commando Nail&quot; with an R-14A radar and a radar scope that offered high resolution. These aircraft were used for all-weather and night low-level strikes against especially dangerous targets by a unit from the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron (1966–1975) dubbed &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Raiders&quot; starting in April 1967. Some of these aircraft were later converted to the Wild Weasel III standard.

In an effort to thwart MiG attacks, several F-105Fs were also fitted with Hallicrafters QRC-128 communication jamming system under project &quot;Combat Martin&quot;. The North Vietnamese interceptor force followed Soviet air-defense doctrine, with pilots under rigid direction of ground controllers over radio links. The QRC-128, nicknamed &quot;Colonel Computer&quot;, filled up the rear cockpit of the F-105F. It bounced voice communications over the radio channel back out after a delay, resulting in an obnoxious garble. However, the first time the Combat Martin was used, the US National Security Agency (NSA), in charge of US strategic signals intelligence, ordered the Air Force to cease and desist immediately, since the NSA believed that the intelligence obtained by monitoring the channels outweighed the benefits of jamming them.

====Thunderstick II====
Experience in Vietnam demonstrated the need for a better visual and blind bombing capability. In March 1968, the Air Force ordered development of an upgraded bombing/navigation system, incorporating a Singer-General Precision inertial navigation system, improvements to the AN/APN-131 navigation radar, and solid-state circuitry for the R-14A radar, which was redesignated R-14K. Furthermore, the digital AN/ARN-92 long-range navigation receiver replaced the problematic AN/ARN-85 receiver. The additional avionics were housed in a long, raised dorsal spine. The modified bombing/navigation system was known as &quot;Thunderstick II&quot;. F-105s with this system could achieve a bombing circular error of probability (CEP) of from an altitude of . Although the first Thunderstick II aircraft flew in 1969, they were not used in Vietnam. A total of 30 F-105Ds received this modification. They were initially assigned to the 563TFS/23TFW at McConnell AFB. In the summer 1972, they were all transferred to the newly reactivated 457TFS (AFRES) at Carswell AFB. This remained the only unit to fly the Thunderstick II until its retirement in 1981–82.

===Wild Weasel===
In 1965, the USAF began operating two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially equipped for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions in Vietnam. Nicknamed the Wild Weasel, these aircraft achieved a number of victories against North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile radars. The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.
The resulting EF-105F Wild Weasel III (the EF designation was popularly used but unofficial) supplemented its sensors and electronic jamming equipment with AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles and conventional bombs, giving it an offensive capability lacking in the F-100F. The first of these aircraft flew on 15 January 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in May, flying their first mission on 6 June 1966, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat RTAFB and six more to the 354th TFS at Takhli RTAFB.

In a typical early mission, a single EF-105F would accompany one or two flights of F-105Ds to provide protection from enemy ground fire. While this strategy was effective in reducing F-105D losses, the Weasel aircraft suffered heavy casualties with five of the first 11 lost in July and August 1966. Attacks into high-risk environments saw the Weasels operating in &quot;Iron Hand&quot; hunter-killer flights of mixed single-seat and two-seat Thunderchiefs, suppressing sites during attacks by the strike force and attacking others en route. In the fall of 1967, EF-105Fs began to be upgraded to the definitive Wild Weasel Thunderchief, the F-105G.

The F-105G incorporated a considerable amount of new SEAD-specific avionics, including an upgraded Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) system which required a redesign of the wingtips. To free outboard hardpoints for additional weapons, the Westinghouse AN/ALQ-105 electronic countermeasures were permanently installed in two long blisters on the underside of the fuselage. Thirty aircraft were fitted with pylons to carry the AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missile. On a typical mission, the F-105G carried two Shrikes on outboard pylons, a single Standard on an inboard pylon balanced by a fuel tank on the other side, and a centerline fuel tank.

==Operational history==
===Introduction===
The F-105B entered USAF service with the Tactical Air Command&#x27;s 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing in August 1958, although the squadron did not become fully operational until 1959. On 11 December 1959, an F-105B piloted by Brig Gen Joseph Moore (commander of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing) set a world record of over a circuit. Difficulties with its avionics and the MA-8 fire-control system were experienced early on; typically the F-105 required 150 hours of maintenance for each flying hour. Most of these problems were addressed under &quot;Project Optimize&quot;. The lack of spares resulted in the entire F-105B fleet being briefly grounded in 1960. In 1964, modified F-105Bs with ballast replacing the cannon, fuselage and wing reinforcement for aerobatics, and the addition of a smoke generator, briefly flew with the United States Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team. After only six shows, a fatal accident from overstressing the airframe led to the reintroduction of the F-100 Super Sabre.

By 1964, the F-105B was relegated to USAF Air National Guard (ANG) squadrons. It was replaced in frontline service by the definitive F-105D whose advanced NASARR R-14A radar and AN/ASG-19 Thunderstick fire-control system gave it all-weather capability. The R-14A radar also added a terrain-avoidance radar capability, while a completely new instrument panel was fitted, replacing dial-type instrument with vertical tape instruments which were easier to read in combat. In order to accommodate the new radar, with a much larger radar dish, the forward fuselage was redesigned, increasing overall length by .
The F-105D entered service with the 335th TFS in September 1960, although it was not fully operational on the F-105D until early 1961. The first overseas F-105 units formed in West Germany in 1961, with the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base in May and the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base in October. Both wings had a primary tactical nuclear strike role for NATO. The F-105D was also deployed to the Pacific, with the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kadena in Okinawa converting in 1962 and the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing converting from 1963.

Like the F-105B, the F-105D&#x27;s early career was plagued with maintenance problems and in-flight failures. The origins of the nickname &quot;Thud&quot; were obscure; some claim that it stood for the sound of an F-105 crashing into the ground. The entire F-105D fleet was grounded in December 1961 and then again in June 1962. Many of the issues were worked out during the production run and by 1964, early F-105Ds were upgraded with these fixes under Project &quot;Look Alike&quot;, although engine failures and fuel system problems persisted until 1967.

Meanwhile, the USAF was gradually changing the anticipated F-105 mission from nuclear interdiction to conventional bombing. The &quot;Look Alike&quot; upgrades increased the aircraft&#x27;s capacity from four to 16 conventional bombs on underwing and fuselage centerline hardpoints and added the equipment to launch AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missiles. In June 1961, an F-105D delivered of conventional bombs during a USAF test—at the time, a record for a single-engine aircraft with a payload three times heavier than American four-engine heavy bombers of World War II, such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, though aerial refueling would be required for long missions. One of the F-105Ds was named &quot;Memphis Belle II&quot; after the famed World War II B-17.

===Vietnam War===
In spite of a troubled early service life, the F-105 became the dominant attack aircraft early in the Vietnam War. The F-105 could carry more than twice the bomb load farther and faster than the F-100, which was used mostly in South Vietnam. In a foreshadowing of its Wild Weasel role, the first F-105D combat mission of the war involved an attack on 14 August 1964 against an anti-aircraft artillery site on Plaine des Jarres. This mission was carried out by aircraft of the 36th TFS, 6441st Tactical Fighter Wing deployed from Yokota Air Base, Japan to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The first Thunderchief lost in the war also occurred during this mission, although the pilot managed to return the aircraft to Korat. The first strike mission took place on 13 January 1965 with the destruction of the Ban Ken bridge in Laos. In early 1965 additional F-105 squadrons were deployed to Korat and Takhli air bases in Thailand. At the start of Operation Rolling Thunder in March 1965, large numbers of F-105Ds were shipped to these bases to participate in intense bombing missions.
On 3 April 1965, a total of 79 aircraft, including 45 F-105 Thunderchiefs, were sent against the Thanh Hoa Bridge, nicknamed &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Jaw&quot;. The next day, enemy MiGs were encountered during a second run upon the bridge; a total of eight MiG-17s faced 46 F-105s escorted by a MiGCAP flight of 21 F-100 Super Sabres. The MiG-17s evaded the escorts using altitude and cloud cover, instead focusing upon the bomb-laden Thunderchiefs. Two Thunderchiefs were lost to the MiG-17s; a third, thought to be lost to ground fire, was later claimed by the North as downed by a MiG-17. One F-105 piloted narrowly escaped. USAF Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell was &quot;hopping mad&quot; to hear that two F-105s had been shot down by Korean War-era subsonic North Vietnamese MiGs. The Thanh Hoa Bridge proved resistant to aerial bombing; multiple missions were flown to damage the bridge both by F-105s and U.S. Navy aircraft.

On 24 July 1965, four U.S. Air Force McDonnell F-4C Phantoms took part in an airstrike against the Dien Ben Phu munitions storage depot and the Lang Chi munitions factory west of Hanoi. One was shot down and three were damaged by SA-2 missiles. After two days, President Johnson gave the order to attack all known SA-2 positions which had been discovered outside the 30-mile exclusion zone. On the morning of 27 July, 48 F-105s participated in the Operation Spring High attack. But the Vietnamese knew U.S. aircraft were coming and set up many 23mm and 37mm anti-aircraft guns at the site. These anti-aircraft guns were lethal at close range and the Vietnamese shot down six aircraft, while more than half of the remaining U.S. aircraft suffered damage from ground fire. Both surface-to-air missile sites were devoid of missiles and equipment, and the Vietnamese had substituted white-painted bundles of bamboo for the real SA-2s. Operation Spring High destroyed two worthless targets at the cost of six aircraft and five pilots.

In December 1966, the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF)&#x27;s MiG-21 pilots of the 921st Regiment claimed to have downed 14 F-105s without any losses.

On a typical combat mission into North Vietnam, the F-105D carried two wing-mounted fuel tanks, a fuel tank in the bomb bay, and five or six bombs, and required inflight refueling going to and sometimes returning from Hanoi distant. F-105s flying in the vicinity of Hanoi would routinely travel around mountainous terrain nicknamed &quot;Thud Ridge&quot; to evade the air defenses surrounding the city. Colonel Jack Broughton, an F-105 pilot in Vietnam, noted the demands of flying close to Hanoi gave &quot;simply no room for error&quot;.
On 11 August 1967, F-105Ds from 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron with support from F-105 Wild Weasels from 338th Tactical Fighter Squadron made the first of many successful attacks on the Paul Doumer bridge over the Red River. Flying low-altitude missions and conducting dive bombings forced the F-105s into range of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns, sometimes coming under heavy fire.

USAF F-105s were escorted by F-4s to protect them against enemy fighters. However, the Thunderchief was officially credited with 27.5 air-to-air victories against VPAF aircraft at the cost of 17 aircraft lost to enemy fighters (North Vietnamese pilots claimed to have shot down an additional 23 F-105s but none have been confirmed by USAF). All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs—one by air-to-air missile, the second by cannon fire and the third by jettisoning the centerline rack full of bombs directly into the path of a surprised MiG.

On 31 May 1968, a dedication ceremony took place at the United States Air Force Academy to honor graduates who had served in Vietnam. An F-105, which had been assembled using parts from ten different F-105s that had seen service in Vietnam, was placed on permanent static display. The ceremony included the entire cadet wing, the superintendent and commandant of cadets of the USAFA, a representative of Republic Aircraft, members of the press, among others. To conclude the ceremony, a flight of four F-105s from McConnell AFB were to fly over in formation at 1,000 feet above the ground and then fly over singly at 250 feet. The formation portion happened as planned. But the flight leader, Lt Col James &quot;Black Matt&quot; Matthews, came back for the single-file pass and exceeded the speed of sound at less than 100 feet. The ensuing sonic boom broke hundreds of windows and fifteen people sustained cuts.

====Medal of Honor recipients====
Two Wild Weasel pilots received the Medal of Honor:
* USAF Captain Merlyn H. Dethlefsen was awarded the Medal of Honor and Capt Kevin &quot;Mike&quot; Gilroy the Air Force Cross for an F-105F Wild Weasel mission on 10 March 1967, flying F-105F, serial number &quot;63-8352&quot;. After their aircraft was damaged by ground fire, Dethlefsen and Gilroy elected to stay in the skies above the steel works at Thai Nguyen until the surface-to-air missile site was found and destroyed.
* USAF Captain Leo K. Thorsness was awarded the Medal of Honor and Capt Harold Johnson the Air Force Cross for an F-105F Wild Weasel mission on 19 April 1967, flying F-105F, serial number &quot;63-8301&quot;. Thorsness and Johnson protected an attempted rescue of another Wild Weasel crew that had been shot down, in the process destroying two MiG-17s. After running out of ammunition, Thorsness and Johnson continued to act as decoys to draw the MiGs away from the rescue aircraft.

===Phase-out and retirement===

As production of F-105s had ended, the type was replaced in the Vietnam War by other aircraft, primarily the F-4 Phantom II. In October 1970, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, which was based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, and was the last F-105D unit in Southeast Asia, began to return to the U.S. The F-105G Wild Weasel versions soldiered on until the end of the war. They were gradually replaced by F-4G Wild Weasel IVs.

The Thunderchief was rapidly withdrawn from USAF service after the end of the Vietnam War. Of the 833 F-105s built, a combined 395 F-105s were lost in Southeast Asia, including 334 (296 F-105Ds and 38 two-seaters) lost to enemy action and 61 lost in operational accidents. Following the war the USAF began transferring the remaining aircraft to Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG) units. By the late 1970s, these aging Thunderchiefs were becoming difficult to maintain. The last F-105Gs with the 128th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the Georgia ANG were retired on 25 May 1983. The last flight of the F-105 Thunderchief was by the AFRES 466th Tactical Fighter Squadron with F-105Ds on 25 February 1984.

<text>A management process is a process of setting goals, planning and/or controlling the organising and leading the execution of any type of activity, such as: 
* A project (project management process), or
* A process (process management process, sometimes referred to as the process performance measurement and management system)

An organization&#x27;s senior management is responsible for carrying out its management process. However, this is not always the case for all management processes, for example, sometimes it is the responsibility of the project manager to carry out a project management process.

== Steps ==
* Planning: Determines the objectives, evaluate the different alternatives and choose the best from them
* Organizing: Defines the group&#x27;s functions, establish relationships and defining authority and responsibility
* Staffing: Recruitment or placement and selection or training takes place for the development of members in the firm
* Directing: Gives direction to the employees
* Controlling: Involves ensuring that performance does not deviate from standards
* Coordination: Ensures different departments and groups work in sync

<text>Étienne Bazeries (21 August 1846, in Port Vendres – 7 November 1931, in Noyon) was a French military cryptanalyst active between 1890 and the First World War. He is best known for developing the &quot;Bazeries Cylinder&quot;, an improved version of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s cipher cylinder. It was later refined into the US Army M-94 cipher device. Historian David Kahn describes him as &quot;the great pragmatist of cryptology. His theoretical contributions are negligible, but he was one of the greatest natural cryptanalysts the science has seen.&quot; (Kahn 1996, p244)

Bazeries was born in Port-Vendres, France, the son of a mounted policeman. In 1863 he enlisted in the army, and fought in the Franco-Prussian War, where he was taken prisoner, although he later managed to escape disguised as a bricklayer. In 1874 he was promoted to lieutenant, and sent to Algeria in 1875. He returned to France the following year and married Marie-Louise-Elodie Berthon, with whom he would father three daughters: Césarine, Fernande and Paule.

He apparently became interested in cryptography through solving cryptograms in newspapers&#x27; personal columns, and soon applied his cryptanalytic skills in a military context when, in 1890, he solved messages enciphered with the official French military transposition system, causing the War Ministry to change to a new scheme. In an effort to prompt reform within the government and enhance national security, Bazeries further exposed weaknesses in French cipher systems. In 1891, news of his talent had spread, and he began work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27; Bureau du Chiffre. Bazeries continued his cryptanalytic work there even after he retired from the Army in 1899, assisting in solving German military ciphers during World War I. However, many of Bazeries recommendations to the government for improvements in official cipher systems met severe bureaucracy and rebuffs, which became a constant source of frustration for him in an otherwise illustrious career. He retired in 1924, aged 78.

In the 1890s he broke a famous nomenclator system called the &quot;Great Cipher&quot;, created by the Rossignols in the 17th century. One of the messages referred to the famous Man in the Iron Mask and provided a possible solution to the mystery. His influential 1901 text &quot;Les Chiffres secrets dévoilés&quot; (&quot;Secret ciphers unveiled&quot;) is considered a landmark in cryptographic literature.

<doc id="401054" wikidata="Q695801" url="?curid=401054" title="Junkers Jumo 004">
<text>The Junkers Jumo 004 was the world&#x27;s first production turbojet engine in operational use, and the first successful axial compressor turbojet engine. Some 8,000 units were manufactured by Junkers in Germany late in World War II, powering the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter and the Arado Ar 234 reconnaissance/bomber, along with prototypes, including the Horten Ho 229. Variants and copies of the engine were produced in Eastern Europe and the USSR for several years following the end of WWII.

==Design and development==
The feasibility of jet propulsion had been demonstrated in Germany in early 1937 by Hans von Ohain working with the Heinkel company. Most of the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) remained uninterested, but Helmut Schelp and Hans Mauch saw the potential of the concept and encouraged Germany&#x27;s aero engine manufacturers to begin their own programmes of jet engine development. The companies remained skeptical and little new development was carried out.

In 1939 Schelp and Mauch visited the companies to check up on progress. Otto Mader, head of the &quot;Junkers Motorenwerke&quot; (Jumo) division of the large Junkers aviation firm, stated that even if the concept was useful, he had no one to work on it. Schelp responded by stating that Dr Anselm Franz, then in charge of Junkers&#x27; turbo- and supercharger development, would be perfect for the job. Franz started his development team later that year, and the project was given the RLM designation 109-004 (the 109- prefix, assigned by the RLM was common to all reaction engine projects in WWII Germany, including German WWII rocket engine designs for manned aircraft).

Franz opted for a design that was at once conservative and revolutionary. His design differed from von Ohain&#x27;s in that he utilised a new type of compressor which allowed a continuous, straight flow of air through the engine (an &quot;axial compressor&quot;), recently developed by the &quot;Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt&quot; (AVA – Aerodynamic Research Institute) at Göttingen. The axial-flow compressor not only had excellent performance, about 78% efficient in &quot;real world&quot; conditions, but it also had a smaller cross-section, important for high-speed aircraft. Dr. Bruno Bruckman&#x27;s old assistant on the jet engine program, Dr. Österich, took over for him in Berlin, and selected the axial flow design, due to its smaller diameter; it was less than the competing axial-flow BMW 003.

On the other hand, he aimed to produce an engine that was far below its theoretical potential, in the interests of expediting development and simplifying production. One major decision was to opt for a simple combustion area using six &quot;flame cans&quot;, instead of the more efficient single annular can. For the same reasons, he collaborated heavily on the development of the engine&#x27;s turbine with &quot;Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft&quot; (General Electric Company, AEG) in Berlin, and instead of building development engines, opted to begin work immediately on the prototype of an engine that could be put straight into production. Franz&#x27;s conservative approach came under question from the RLM, but was vindicated when even given the developmental problems that it was to face, the 004 entered production and service well ahead of the BMW 003, its more technologically advanced but slightly lower thrust competitor (7.83 kN/1,760 lbf).

At Kolbermoor, location of the Heinkel-Hirth engine works, the post-war Fedden Mission, led by Sir Roy Fedden, found jet engine manufacturing was simpler and required lower-skill labor and less sophisticated tooling than piston engine production; in fact, most of the making of hollow turbine blades and sheet metal work on jets could be done by tooling used in making automobile body panels. Fedden himself criticized the attachment of the 004&#x27;s compressor casing, which was in two halves, bolted to the half-sections of the stator assemblies.

===Technical description and testing===

The first prototype 004A, which used diesel fuel, was first tested in October 1940, though without an exhaust nozzle. It was bench-tested at the end of January 1941 to a maximum thrust of , and work continued to increase the thrust, the RLM contract having set a minimum of thrust.

Vibration problems with the compressor stators, originally cantilevered from the outside, delayed the program at this point. Max Bentele, as an Air Ministry consulting engineer with a background in turbocharger vibrations, assisted in solving the problem. The original aluminium stators were replaced with steel ones in which configuration the engine developed in August, and passed a 10-hour endurance run at in December. The first flight test took place on March 15, 1942, when a 004A was carried aloft by a Messerschmitt Bf 110 to run up the engine in flight. The 004 used an eight-stage axial-flow compressor, with six straight-through combustion chambers (made from sheet steel), and a one-stage turbine with hollow blades.

On July 18, one of the prototype Messerschmitt Me 262s flew for the first time under jet power from its 004 engines, and the 004 went into production with an order from the RLM for 80 engines.

The initial 004A engines built to power the Me 262 prototypes had been built without restrictions on materials, and they used scarce raw materials such as nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum in quantities which were unacceptable in production. Franz realized that the Jumo 004 would have to be redesigned to incorporate a minimum of these strategic materials, and this was accomplished. All the hot metal parts, including the combustion chamber, were changed to mild steel protected by an aluminum coating, and the hollow turbine blades were produced from folded and welded Cromadur alloy (12% chromium, 18% manganese, and 70% iron) developed by Krupp, and cooled by compressed air &quot;bled&quot; from the compressor. The engine&#x27;s operational lifespan was shortened, but on the plus side it became easier to construct. Production engines had a cast magnesium casing in two halves, one with half-sections of stator assemblies bolted to it. The four front stators were constructed from steel alloy blades welded to the mount; the rear five were pressed steel sheet bent over the mount and welded on. Steel alloy compressor blades dovetailled into slots in the compressor disk and were fixed by small screws. The compressor itself was mounted to a steel shaft with twelve set screws. Jumo tried a variety of compressor blades, beginning with solid steel, later hollow sheet metal ones, welded on the taper, with their roots fitted over rhomboidal studs on the turbine wheel, to which they were pinned and brazed.

One interesting feature of the 004 was the starter, designed by the German engineer Norbert Riedel, which consisted of a 2-stroke flat engine behind the intake nose-cone. A hole in the front of the cone gave access to a manual pull-start if the electric starter motor failed. Two small gasoline/oil mix tanks were fitted within the upper perimeter of the annular intake&#x27;s sheet metal housing for fuelling the starter. The Riedel was also used for starting the competing BMW 003 engine, and for Heinkel&#x27;s more advanced HeS 011 &quot;mixed-flow&quot; compressor design.

The first production model of the 004B weighed less than the 004A, and in 1943 had passed several 100-hour tests, with a time between overhauls of 50 hours being achieved.

Later in 1943 the 004B version suffered turbine blade failures which were not understood by the Junkers team. They focused on areas such as material defects, grain size and surface roughness. Eventually, in December, blade-vibration specialist Max Bentele was once again brought in during a meeting at the RLM headquarters. He identified that the failures were caused by one of the blades&#x27; natural frequencies being in the engine running range. His solution was to raise the frequency, by increasing the blade taper and shortening them by 1 millimetre, and to reduce the operating speed of the engine from 9,000 to 8,700 rpm.

It was not until early 1944 that full production could finally begin. These sorts of engineering detail challenges for the 109-004-series of jet engine designs, formed the setbacks that were the principal factor delaying the Luftwaffe&#x27;s introduction of the Me 262 into squadron service.

Given the lower-quality steels used in the 004B, these engines had a service life of only 10–25 hours, perhaps twice this in the hands of a careful pilot. Another shortcoming of the engine, common to all early turbojets, was its sluggish throttle response. Worse, too much fuel could be injected into the combustion chambers by moving the throttle too quickly, causing the temperature to rise too far before the airflow increased to match the increased fuel. This overheated the turbine blades, and was a major cause for engine failures. Nevertheless, it made jet power for combat aircraft a reality for the first time.
 
The exhaust area of the engine used a a variable geometry nozzle known as a plug nozzle. The plug was nicknamed the &quot;Zwiebel&quot; (German for onion, due to its shape when seen from the side). The plug moved about 40 cm (16 inch) fore-and-aft, using an electric motor-powered rack-and-pinion, to change the exhaust cross-sectional area for thrust control.

The Jumo 004 could run on three types of fuel:
* J-2, its standard fuel, a synthetic fuel produced from coal.
* Diesel oil.
* Aviation gasoline; not considered desirable due to its high rate of consumption.

Costing &quot;RM&quot;10,000 for materials, the Jumo 004 also proved somewhat cheaper than the competing BMW 003, which was &quot;RM&quot;12,000, and cheaper than the Junkers 213 piston engine, which was &quot;RM&quot;35,000. Moreover, the jets used lower-skill labor and needed only 375 hours to complete (including manufacture, assembly, and shipping), compared to 1,400 for the BMW 801. 

Production and maintenance of the 004 was done at the Junkers works at Magdeburg, under the supervision of Otto Hartkopf. Completed engines earned a reputation for unreliability; the time between major overhauls (not technically a time between overhaul) was thirty to fifty hours, and may have been as low as ten, though a skilled flyer could double the interval. (The competing BMW 003&#x27;s was about fifty.) The process involved replacing compressor blades, (which suffered the most damage, usually from ingesting stones and such, later known as fodding) and turbine blades damaged by the high thermodynamic loads. The Germans were known to use both specially designed wire-framed hemispherical cages and/or flat circular covers over the intakes to prevent ingestion of foreign matter into their aircraft jet engines&#x27; intakes while on the ground. The compressor and turbine blades&#x27; life could be extended by re-balancing the rotors during routine maintenance; the Riedel two-stroke starter engine and the turbojet&#x27;s governor would also be examined and replaced as needed. Combustors required maintenance every twenty hours, and replacement at 200.

Between 5,000 and 8,000 004s were built; at the end of the Second World War, production stood at 1,500 per month. The Fedden Mission, led by Sir Roy Fedden, postwar estimated total jet engine production by mid-1946 could have reached 100,000 units a year, or more.

===Postwar production===

Following World War II, Jumo 004s were built in small numbers in Malešice in Czechoslovakia, designated Avia Avia M-04, to power the Avia S-92 which was itself a copy of the Me 262. Upgraded Jumo 004 copies were also built in the Soviet Union as the Klimov RD-10, where they powered the Yakovlev Yak-15 as well as many prototype jet fighters.

In France, captured 004s powered the Sud-Ouest SO 6000 Triton and the Arsenal VG-70.

<text>Rebel Rabbit is a 1949 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on April 9, 1949, and features Bugs Bunny.

In the film, Bugs finds the insignificant bounty on rabbits to be offensive. He is informed that rabbits are considered harmless. He sets out to prove how dangerous he can be, by vandalizing monuments and landmarks throughout the United States. He is soon targeted by the entire War Department. He starts serving a prison sentence in Alcatraz Island, while trying to figure out whether he overdid it.

==Plot==
Bugs notices high bounties on various animals: $50 on foxes, $75 on bears, but then he becomes offended by the two-cent bounty on rabbits. Bugs has himself mailed to Washington, D.C., where a supercilious game commissioner explains that the bounty is so low because, while foxes and bears are &quot;obnoxious&quot; animals who damage property, &quot;rabbits are perfectly harmless.&quot; Bugs vows to prove that &quot;A rabbit can be more obnoxious than anybody!&quot; and after squirting the official&#x27;s face with an ink pen, storms out, slamming the game commissioner&#x27;s door so hard that the glass shatters.

Bugs begins his campaign of direct action by attacking a guard on the leg with his own billy club. From there, he pulls stunts like renaming Barney Baruch&#x27;s private bench to &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; bench, painting barbershop pole stripes on the Washington Monument, and rewiring the lights in Times Square to read &quot;BUGS BUNNY WUZ HERE&quot;.

Various newspapers comment about Bugs&#x27; actions as he goes to Buffalo, New York and shuts down Niagara Falls (revealing a faucet above and some barrels beneath it). Bugs then sells the entire island of Manhattan back to the Native Americans and is shown walking through it wearing a stereotypical feathered headdress and smoking a peace pipe, asiding to the audience &quot;Ehh, they wouldn&#x27;t take it until I threw in a set of dishes&quot;. Afterwards, Bugs saws Florida off from the rest of the country and quotes &quot;South America, take it away!&quot; Bugs then wonders what other kind of devilry he can commit. Bugs heads to Panama and swipes all the locks off the Panama Canal, which are represented as actual locks as he yells &quot;I got &#x27;em! I got &#x27;em! I got &#x27;em!&quot;. Bugs then heads to Arizona where he fills up the Grand Canyon. He then concludes his campaign by literally tying up railroad tracks.

An outraged bombastic Southern Senator Claghorn–esque Congressman speaks before the United States Congress and demands that they take action against Bugs, but is interrupted by Bugs who emerges from the congressman&#x27;s hat, slaps him and gives him a mocking kiss. The cartoon then shows live-action footage of the entire War Department mobilizing against him. Tanks come rumbling out of their garages, soldiers pour out of barracks, the US Horse Cavalry, tanks and jet planes charge toward Bugs and bugles blow as the news of this is shown.

Bugs, now satisfied with the $1 million bounty on his head (although the bounty is for &quot;him&quot; specifically, not rabbits in general), has his Tarzan yell interrupted by the whole US Army coming after him, much to his horror. Bugs then dives into a fox hole as artillery shells surround the foxhole. Bugs then says, &quot;Ehh, could it be that I carried this thing too far?&quot; just as the shells explode. It then cuts to Alcatraz Island where Bugs, in his jail cell, finally remarks &quot;Ehhh, could be...!&quot;

==Home media==
The uncut short is available on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3&quot; DVD set.

<doc id="401060" wikidata="Q775821" url="?curid=401060" title="William Harcourt (politician)">
<text>Sir William George Granville Venables Vernon Harcourt, (14 October 1827 – 1 October 1904) was a British lawyer, journalist and Liberal statesman. He was Member of Parliament for Oxford, Derby then West Monmouthshire and held the offices of Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under William Ewart Gladstone before becoming Leader of the Opposition. A talented speaker in parliament, he was sometimes regarded as aloof and possessing only an intellectual involvement in his causes. He failed to engender much emotional response in the public and became only a reluctant and disillusioned leader of his party.

Historian Roy Jenkins says he was &quot;too much of a party man. In manner and by origin he was a patrician figure, but he saw most issues exclusively in terms of parliamentary infighting… His views were usually much more of a reaction to what his political enemies, in the other party and in his own, were saying than the result of any objective thought. He inspired considerable loyalty among his followers – the Great Gladiator he was sometimes enthusiastically called – but his colleagues, partly as a result of his execrable temperament and his bullying… found him a difficult man with whom to work.&quot;

==Family and ancestry==

Harcourt was the second son of Canon William Vernon Harcourt, a scientist and owner of Nuneham Park, Nuneham Courtenay, Oxfordshire and his wife Matilda Mary, daughter of Colonel William Gooch. His father was the fourth son and eventually heir of Edward Harcourt, Archbishop of York and his wife Lady Anne Leveson-Gower. Anne was a daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford and kinswoman Lady Louisa Egerton. Her maternal grandparents included Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater and Rachel. Rachel was a daughter of Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford and the rich heiress Elizabeth, daughter of John Howland of Streatham. William was, due to the family&#x27;s appendage of a surname to recognise an inheritance, born a Vernon, and his position as a senior heir in the landed Vernon and Harcourt was emphasised by his link to many of the greater English houses, a fact of which he was proud. In later life his descent from the Plantagenets was a joke among his political opponents. 

His probate was sworn in the year he died (when he was resident at Nuneham Park and at &quot;Malwood&quot; in Hampshire) then resworn, over £3000 upward, at ninepence short of .

==Education and early life==
William&#x27;s childhood was an austere one, educated at home by a Swiss governess, he was sent to a private school at Southwell, Nottinghamshire, when he was eight. William&#x27;s father denied him a public school education, sending him to be educated in classics at the small class of Rev. John Owen Parr. In 1840, Parr moved to Preston and William witnessed the Preston bread riots there in 1842. He left Parr in 1844 and, after two more years&#x27; study at home, William entered Trinity College, Cambridge, to pursue his interest in mathematics. At Cambridge he became an Apostle, and graduated with first-class honours in the classics tripos in 1851, but he did not enjoy the mathematics, graduating only senior optime.

At Cambridge, William rejected his family&#x27;s Tory instincts and began to write for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; in support of Sir Robert Peel. William&#x27;s father encouraged him to seek a Cambridge fellowship or a career in politics but William chose law and journalism. He entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1852 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1854.

He quickly made his mark as a speaker, his reception into London society being eased by his uncle George Harcourt and aunt Frances Waldegrave. From 1855 William started to write for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, becoming increasingly a follower of William Ewart Gladstone and an opponent of Lord Palmerston. He practised in railway law, commentating, especially in &quot;The Times&quot; on international law. In 1862, he wrote some famous letters to &quot;The Times&quot; over the signature of &quot;Historicus,&quot; supporting Britain&#x27;s neutrality in the American Civil War and condemning the widespread public sympathy for the Confederate States. He also wrote on the Trent Affair and the Alabama controversy. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1866, and was appointed Whewell professor of international law at the University of Cambridge in 1869.

==Political career==
Harcourt entered parliament as Liberal member for Oxford, and sat from 1868 to 1880, being appointed Solicitor General and knighted in 1873. He was re-elected in the Liberal victory at the 1880 United Kingdom general election and, though he had not been a strong supporter of Gladstone in opposition, he was appointed Home Secretary. A mandatory re-election was then required on acceptance of such an office and Harcourt was defeated by Alexander William Hall by just 54 votes. Though Hall was then unseated for political corruption, a seat was found for Harcourt at Derby, by the voluntary retirement of Samuel Plimsoll. He continued to co-represent Derby until 1895, when, having been defeated, he found a seat in West Monmouthshire.

His name became connected with the passing of the Ground Game Act 1880 and the Arms (Ireland) Act 1881. As Home Secretary at the time of the Phoenix Park killings and the subsequent London bombings he reacted rapidly, and the Explosive Substances Act 1883 was passed through all its stages in the shortest time on record. His robust stand on law and order brought him into conflict with the Irish members. In 1884 he introduced an aborted bill for unifying the municipal administration of London. and led the demand for a prosecution in the survival cannibalism case of &quot;Dudley and Stephens&quot;, but also advised the Queen to grant clemency, to six months&#x27; in prison. In 1885 he similarly saw commutation of John &#x27;Babbacombe&#x27; Lee&#x27;s death penalty to life imprisonment after his execution failed three times. He was further the victim of the embarrassing stunts of the Harcourt interpolation and the Home Office Baby.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===

He was recognised as one of the ablest and most effective leaders of the Liberal party and when, after a brief interval in 1885, Gladstone returned to office in 1886, Harcourt was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, an office which he again filled from 1892 to 1895. Between 1880 and 1892 Harcourt acted as Gladstone&#x27;s political deputy. A first-rate party fighter, his services were of huge value. However, in spite of his great success as a platform speaker, he was generally felt to be speaking from an &quot;advocate&#x27;s brief&quot;, and did not impress the public as a conviction politician. It was he who coined the phrase about &quot;stewing in Parnellite juice&quot;, and, when the split came in the Liberal party on the Irish question, even those who gave Gladstone and John Morley the credit of being convinced Home Rulers could not be persuaded that Harcourt had followed anything but the line of party expediency.

In 1894 he introduced and carried a memorable budget, which equalised the death duties on real and personal property. After Gladstone&#x27;s retirement in 1894 and Lord Rosebery&#x27;s selection as prime minister, Harcourt became the leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, but it was never probable that he would work comfortably in the new conditions. He had been ignored as Gladstone&#x27;s successor, and it was evident that Rosebery&#x27;s ideas of Liberalism and of the policy of the Liberal Party were not those of Harcourt. Their differences were patched up from time to time, but the combination was unstable. However the one significant legacy of the government was the introduction of a high uniform rate of death duties in Harcourt&#x27;s 1894 budget. Harcourt himself was a second son, and thus unlikely to ever have to pay such duties himself, so it was often quipped that this introduction was a &quot;second son&#x27;s revenge&quot;. However, this proved to not be the case, when Harcourt inherited the Nuneham Park estate in Oxfordshire.

===Leader of the Opposition===

At the 1895 elections it was clear that there were divisions as to what issue the Liberals were fighting for. The effect of Harcourt&#x27;s aborted Local Veto Bill, which would have given parishes the right to vote on the closure of all local public houses, on the election was seen not only in his defeat at Derby, which gave the signal for the Liberal rout, but in the set-back it gave to temperance legislation. Though returned for West Monmouthshire (1895, 1900), Harcourt&#x27;s speeches in debate only occasionally showed his characteristic spirit, and it was evident that for the hard work of opposition he no longer had the same motivation as of old. In October 1896 Gladstone, in his last public speech, called for action to support the Armenians who were being massacred by their Ottoman rulers. Harcourt backed Gladstone but Rosebery used the incident as an excuse to resign as Leader of the Opposition and Harcourt became an unenthusiastic leader.

During Harcourt&#x27;s period as leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, the all-House enquiry into the failed Jameson Raid took place. Harcourt&#x27;s performance in the enquiry disillusioned sections of the Liberal party, as the Opposition let the Conservative government off the hook by not exposing the involvement of the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain in the raid&#x27;s genesis and preparation, Harcourt instead settling for censure of the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, Cecil Rhodes.

In December 1898 the crisis arrived and, with Morley, Harcourt retired from the party and resigned his Leadership of the Opposition, alleging as his reason, in letters to Morley, the cross-currents of opinion among his old supporters and former colleagues. The split excited considerable comment, and resulted in much heart-searching and a more or less open division between the section of the Liberal party following Rosebery and those who disliked his imperialism.

Though now a private member, Harcourt still continued to assert his independent position, and his attacks on the government were no longer restrained by any deference to Liberal Imperialism. He actively intervened in 1899 and 1900, strongly condemning the government&#x27;s financial policy and their attitude towards the Transvaal. Throughout the Second Boer War he lost no opportunity of criticising the South African developments in a pessimistic vein. A great parliamentary debater, he sprinkled his speeches with humour. From 1898 to 1900 he was conspicuous, both on the platform and in letters to &quot;The Times&quot;, in demanding active measures against Ritualism in the Church of England. However, his attitude in this was reflected in his political advocacy of disestablishment. In March 1904, just after he had announced his intention not to seek election again to parliament, he succeeded, by the death of his nephew, to the family estates at Nuneham. He found that the estate was in crisis, especially after having to pay the death duties he himself had introduced, and he died suddenly there in the same year.

Harcourt was offered a peerage in 1902 but he declined it in order to stay in the House of Commons, and to allow his son to advance his political career.

==Marriages and children==

On 5 November 1859, Harcourt married his first wife Maria Theresa Lister, known as Therese. She was a daughter of novelist Thomas Henry Lister and Lady Maria Theresa Villiers. They had two children:

*Julian Harcourt (6 October 1860 – 2 March 1862).
*Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt (31 January 1863 – 24 February 1922). Originally christened Reginald, but rechristened at the age of two months. Lewis Harcourt served as Private Secretary to his father and later became a prominent politician in his own right, most notably as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1910 to 1915.

His first wife died on 1 February 1863, only a day after giving birth to their second and last son. Harcourt remained a widower for thirteen years. On 2 December 1876, he married his second wife Elizabeth Cabot Motley. Elizabeth was a daughter of American historian John Lothrop Motley and his wife Mary Benjamin. Her maternal uncle Park Benjamin was a patent lawyer and writer on scientific subjects. She had been previously married to naval officer Thomas Poynton Ives. Ives was among the casualties of the American Civil War. By this second marriage, Harcourt had his third and final son:

*Robert Harcourt (born 7 May 1878). He married Marjorie Laura Cunard. Their daughter Mary Elizabeth Harcourt married Ian Rochfort Johnston, a Commander of the Royal Navy.

<text>The shower-curtain effect in physics describes the phenomenon of a shower curtain being blown inward when a shower is running. The problem of identifying the cause of this effect has been featured in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine, with several theories given to explain the phenomenon but no definite conclusion.

The shower-curtain effect may also be used to describe the observation of how nearby phase front distortions of an optical wave are more severe than remote distortions of the same amplitude.

==Hypotheses ==

===Buoyancy hypothesis ===

Also called chimney effect or stack effect, observes that warm air (from the hot shower) rises out over the shower curtain as cooler air (near the floor) pushes in under the curtain to replace the rising air. By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and Coandă effects become more significant. However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this is not the sole mechanism.

===Bernoulli effect hypothesis ===
The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure. This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a shower head causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing in the same direction as the water. This movement would be parallel to the plane of the shower curtain. If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli&#x27;s principle says the air pressure there will drop. This would result in a pressure differential between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move inward. It would be strongest when the gap between the bather and the curtain is smallest, resulting in the curtain attaching to the bather.

===Horizontal vortex hypothesis ===
A computer simulation of a typical bathroom found that none of the above theories pan out in their analysis, but instead found that the spray from the shower-head drives a horizontal vortex. This vortex has a low-pressure zone in the centre, which sucks the curtain.

David Schmidt of the University of Massachusetts was awarded the 2001 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for his partial solution to the question of why shower curtains billow inwards. He used a computational fluid dynamics code to achieve the results. Professor Schmidt is adamant that this was done &quot;for fun&quot; in his own free time without the use of grants.

===Coandă effect===
The Coandă effect, also known as &quot;boundary layer attachment&quot;, is the tendency of a moving fluid to adhere to an adjacent wall.

===Condensation===
A hot shower will produce steam that condenses on the shower side of the curtain, lowering the pressure there. In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative.

===Air pressure===
Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom.

==Solutions==

Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. They may have adhesive suction cups on the bottom edges of the curtain, which are then pushed onto the sides of the shower when in use. Others may have magnets at the bottom, though these are not effective on acrylic or fiberglass tubs.

It is possible to use a telescopic shower curtain rod to block the curtain on its lower part and to prevent it from sucking inside.

Hanging the curtain rod higher or lower, or especially further away from the shower head, can reduce the effect. A convex shower rod can also be used to hold the curtain against the inside wall of a tub.

A weight can be attached to a long string and the string attached to the curtain rod in the middle of the curtain (on the inside). Hanging the weight low against the curtain just above the rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it.

There are a few alternative solutions that either attach to the shower curtain directly, attach to the shower rod or attach to the wall.

<text>Thomas Pryor Gore (December 10, 1870March 16, 1949) was an American politician who served as one of the first two United States senators from Oklahoma, from 1907 to 1921 and again from 1931 to 1937. He first entered politics as an activist for the Populist Party, and continued this affiliation after he moved to Texas. In 1899, just before moving to Oklahoma Territory to practice law in Lawton, he formally joined the Democratic Party and campaigned for William Jennings Bryan. In the Senate, his anti-war beliefs caused him conflict with Democratic presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Gore lost his eyesight during his youth. He was the maternal grandfather of noted author Gore Vidal.

==Early life==
Gore was born on December 10, 1870, near Embry, Mississippi in Webster County, the son of Caroline Elizabeth (née Wingo) and Thomas Madison Gore. The Gore family was one of the nineteen original families who owned farmlands in what later became the capital of the United States, the District of Columbia. The Gores were Anglo-Irish from Donegal and arrived in North America at the end of the seventeenth century and tended to intermarry with other Anglo-Irish families, particularly in Virginia. When the District was established in 1790, the families that had been dispossessed to make way for the capital city, including the Gores, reaped significant financial rewards. The Gores who remained either sold their land in lots, built homes or hotels, and all became rich. The Gores who moved away, including the branch of Thomas Pryor Gore, moved to the far West, which in those days was Mississippi. Young Thomas and his family moved to Walthall, the county seat, when his father was elected Chancery Clerk of Sumner County.

He went blind as a child through two separate accidents but did not give up his dream of becoming a senator. Despite his blindness, he excelled in school and showed special talents in debate and oratory.

==Career==
He taught school briefly after graduation. In 1882, he served as a page in the Mississippi Senate. He moved to Lebanon, Tennessee in 1891, and received a law degree from Cumberland University Law School in the following year. He was admitted to the Mississippi Bar and joined his father&#x27;s law firm in Mississippi.

===Populist Party politics===
The Gore family had been prominent members of the Southern Farmers&#x27; Alliance. Young Thomas was addressing Alliance meetings as early as 1888. The Alliance nominated him for the state legislature, but he had to withdraw because he was still a minor. Instead he served as a presidential elector for the Populist party in 1892. This experience expanded his reputation as an orator. In 1894, the Populist party of Navarro County, Texas invited him to come to Corsicana to help them win elections. He and his brother, Ellis, moved there in December, 1894, where they opened a law office. Meanwhile, he returned to Mississippi to run for the legislature in 1895, a race which he lost. He campaigned vigorously from Utah to New York for William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic candidate for president in 1900.

Returning to Texas, he ran as a Populist candidate for the 6th Congressional District in 1898, but lost because the party was already in decline. He served as a delegate to the Populist convention that year, but in 1899, formally joined the Democratic Party.

===Democratic Party politics===
After marrying Nina Kay in December 1900, the Gores moved to Lawton, in Oklahoma Territory. In 1902, he entered and won an election for the Oklahoma Territorial Senate. He declined an opportunity to run as a territorial representative for the U. S, Congress, but became an adviser to the 1907 Constitutional Convention, then was elected to the U. S. Senate in 1907.

In 1907, he was elected to the Senate as one of the first two senators from the new state of Oklahoma. He was re-elected in 1908 and 1914 but lost his seat in 1920. Gore and William H. &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; Murray were co-leaders of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Oklahoma campaign for the Presidency in 1912. He was known as a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, who supported many of Wilson&#x27;s domestic programs, and worked well with Republicans such as Robert La Follette. He was to a large extent no different from any other politician because of his blindness, but there were problems, as La Follette recounts an example in his memoirs when, during a filibuster, Gore did not realize that the senator who was to take over speaking for him had left the room, and the filibuster failed because he did not continue to speak. Also, some of Gore&#x27;s colleagues in the Senate would attempt to take advantage of Gore&#x27;s blindness by tricking him into signing documents that it was not in his party&#x27;s interest for him to sign. He was famous for turning the tables on these sharp dealers and tricking them into signing documents that they did not intend to sign. These exploits made him popular with the press, who dubbed him &quot;The Blind Cowboy.&quot;

In 1910, he accused lobbyist Jake L. Hamon Sr., of trying to bribe him.

In 1914, a woman stated that Gore had &quot;taken advantage&quot; of her in a hotel room. When prosecutors declined to file charges against the senator, the woman filed a civil suit against him. The jury sided with Gore, and the woman lost her suit.

Gore was a pacifist and an anti-interventionist who campaigned against militarism, and loudly and vociferously condemned the malefactors of wealth as being the impetus for pushing America towards war; though he was often referred to as an isolationist. He voted against the Wilson Administration on most legislation pertaining to World War I. However, a majority of Oklahoma voters favored helping the Allies fight Germany. After the war, he also opposed Wilson&#x27;s plan to support a League of Nations. Not only did Gore alienate many previous supporters, but he also lost his close relationship with Wilson. Thus, he lost his bid for reelection in 1920. After leaving the Senate, he returned to his private law practice full-time in Washington D.C.
During the early stages of World War I, he co-authored the Gore-McLemore Resolutions to encourage American citizens not to travel aboard merchant vessels of countries participating in the war. The merchant vessels were under threat of attack by German U-boats, and the Senator felt the loss of American lives in attacks upon these boats put American neutrality at risk. He was a strong, early supporter of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s, indeed, one acknowledged as the very first major elected official to endorse Wilson&#x27;s candidacy for president in 1911. Yet Gore later opposed America&#x27;s entry into the war even after American involvement began. He unsuccessfully opposed providing manpower for the military by conscription, saying it would create &quot;an army of conscripted slackers.&quot; He asked: &quot;Why should we brand the American boy as a conscript without affording him the opportunity to earn the glory of an American volunteer?&quot; This was the principal cause of Gore&#x27;s defeat in the Democratic primary in 1920 by Congressman Scott Ferris, who was in turn defeated in the general election by Republican John W. Harreld. In addition to his opposition to the draft, Gore &quot;was one of the earliest and most vigorous sponsors of a constitutional amendment to require a popular referendum on any congressional declaration of war.&quot; On domestic policy he was a supporter of the interests of farmers and Native Americans.

Gore was re-elected to the Senate in 1930. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as President, Gore at first supported his New Deal policies but later feuded with him. In 1935, Gore helped lead the charge against funding the Works Progress Administration (WPA). In written response to constituents who favored the WPA, he told them that their attitude &quot;shows how the dole spoils the soul. Your telegram intimates that your votes are for sale. Much as I value votes I am not in the market. I cannot consent to buy votes with the people&#x27;s money. I owe a debt to the taxpayer as well as to the unemployed.&quot; After dictating these words, the blind senator was led to the Senate floor to cast the lone vote against the WPA.

Gore ran for re-election in 1936, but was overwhelmingly defeated in the Democratic primary. He took 18% of the vote and ended up in fourth place, behind Congressman Joshua B. Lee, Governor E. W. Marland, and attorney Gomer Smith. Lee ultimately won the primary against Marland in a runoff.

Gore retired from the Senate in January 1937 and practiced law in Washington, D.C., until his death in 1949.

==Personal life==
Thomas married Nina Belle Kay (1877–1963), a Texas plantation owner&#x27;s daughter, on December 27, 1900. She was described as his &quot;constant companion&quot; and as his &quot;eyes.&quot; They moved to Lawton, Oklahoma in June 1901. They had two children:

* Nina S. Gore (1903–1978), who married Eugene Luther Vidal (1895–1969) in 1922. They divorced in 1935, and later that year, she married Hugh D. Auchincloss. They divorced in 1941.
* Thomas Notley Gore (1910–1964)

Gore died on March 16, 1949; he was buried at Rosehill Cemetery, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, but was later re-interred on July 19, 1949, in Fairlawn Cemetery, also in Oklahoma City. According to his grandson, Gore Vidal, Gore was &quot;the first and, I believe, last senator from an oil state to die without a fortune.&quot;

Gore Vidal stated that his grandfather was an atheist and had a strong misanthropic streak: &quot;He was a genuine populist; but he did not like people very much. He always said no to anyone who wanted government aid.&quot; During a speech to the National Press Club on November 4, 1994, Vidal claimed that Thomas Gore had said &quot;If there was any race other than the human race, I&#x27;d go join it.&quot;

===Descendants===
Through his daughter he was the grandfather of writer Gore Vidal (1925–2012), Nina Gore Auchincloss (born 1937), who was married to Newton Steers from 1957 to 1974, and then Michael Straight from 1974 to 1998, and Thomas Gore Auchincloss (born 1937) who married Diana &quot;Didi&quot; Lippert.

===Honors===
Thomas Gore was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1932.

A major road artery in Lawton, Oklahoma, Gore Boulevard, is named after him, as is the eastern Oklahoma town of Gore.

<text>Taiyuan (Taiyuan Jin: /tʰai˦˥ ye˩˩/) is the capital of Shanxi, China. Taiyuan is the political, economic, cultural and international exchange center of Shanxi Province. It is an industrial base focusing on energy and heavy chemicals. Throughout its long history, Taiyuan was the capital or provisional capital of many dynasties in China, hence the name ().

As of 2021, the city governs 6 districts, 3 counties, and hosts a county-level city with a total area of 6,988 square kilometers and a permanent population of 5,390,957.

Taiyuan is located roughly in the centre of Shanxi, with the Fen River flowing through the central city.

==Etymology and names==
The two Chinese characters of the city&#x27;s name are (, &quot;great&quot;) and (, &quot;plain&quot;), referring to the location where the Fen River leaves the mountains and enters a relatively flat plain. Throughout its long history, the city had various names, including () (from which the city&#x27;s abbreviated single-character name () is derived), () and ().

During the Tang dynasty and subsequent Five Dynasties, the status of the city of Taiyuan was elevated to be the Northern Capital, hence the name (), and (, different from present-day Beijing).

==History==
Taiyuan is an ancient city with more than 2500 years of urban history, dating back from 497 BC. It was the capital or secondary capital (, ) of Zhao, Former Qin, Eastern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Jin, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, Northern Han. Its strategic location and rich history make Taiyuan one of the economic, political, military, and cultural centers of Northern China.

===Pre-Qin dynasty history===
From about 859 BC the area around modern-day Taiyuan was occupied by the Rong people. In 662 BC the Rong were driven out by the Di people.

In 497 BC, the first ancient city of Jinyang was built around the southern Jinyuan District of present-day Taiyuan, by Dong Anyu (), who was a steward of (), an upper-level official of the state of Jin.

During the Battle of Jinyang in 453 BC, Zhi Yao diverted the flow of the Fen River to inundate the city of Jinyang, caused significant damage to the Zhao. Later, Zhao Xiangzi alerted Wei and Han, who both decided to ally with Zhao. On the night of 8 May 453 BC, Zhao troops broke the dams of the Fen River and let the river flood the Zhi armies, and eventually annihilated the Zhi army, with the help from Wei and Han.

The Tripartition of Jin happened in 403 BC, when the state of Jin, then a strong power in Northern China, was divided into three smaller states of Han, Zhao and Wei. This event is the watershed between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in Chinese history.

===Qin dynasty===
In 248 BC, the state of Qin attacked Zhao under General Meng&#x27;ao, and obtained the area around Jinyang from Zhao. Qin set up the Commandery of Taiyuan (), with the city of Jinyang as its administrative center. Although, the name &quot;Taiyuan&quot; had appeared in historic records before, potentially referring to different regions in nowadays southern and central Shanxi, this was the first time &quot;Taiyuan&quot; was officially used to refer to present-day Taiyuan.

Between 229 and 228 BC, Qin General Li Xin lead two armies that marched from the cities of Taiyuan and Yunzhong to attack Zhao&#x27;s northern commandery of Dai. Three months after General Li Mu&#x27;s death; Wang Jian, Li Xin &amp; Qiang Lei conquered Zhao.

In 221 BC, Qin conquered the rest of China, and officially started the first imperial dynasty of China. Qin established thirty-six commanderies on its territory, and Taiyuan was one of them. Also, the capital of commandery of Taiyuan was Jinyang.

===Jin dynasty and Sixteen Kingdoms===
During the Jin dynasty, Taiyuan was again changed into a vassal state. Following the ending of the Jin dynasty, ethnic minority peoples settled a series of short-lived sovereign states in northern China, commonly referred to as Sixteen Kingdoms. Taiyuan was part of Former Zhao, Later Zhao, Former Qin, Former Yan, Former Qin again, Western Yan, and Later Yan chronologically.

In 304, Liu Yuan founded the Xiongnu state of Former Zhao, whose army raided the area around Taiyuan for years and eventually obtained Taiyuan in 316. In 319, Taiyuan became part of Later Zhao, founded by Shi Le. Later, Taiyuan was obtained by Former Yan in 358, and by Former Qin in 370.

Fu Jian died in 384. His son Fu Pi declared himself an emperor in 385, with Jinyang (central city of Taiyuan) as the capital. But the next year, Fu Pi was defeated by the Western Yan prince Murong Yong in 386, and Taiyuan became part of Western Yan.

===Southern and Northern Dynasties===
In 386, Tuoba Gui founded Northern Wei. In 396, Northern Wei expanded to Taiyuan.
In 543, Eastern Wei was founded by Gao Huan, with the capital at the city of Ye, and Taiyuan as the alternative capital (), where the Mansion of the &quot;Great Chancellor&quot; Gao Huan () was located.

In 577, Taiyuan was conquered and became part of Northern Zhou.

===Sui dynasty===

In 581, Emperor Wen of Sui founded Sui dynasty. Jinyang was first the administrative center of Bing Zhou (), which was changed into Taiyuan Commandery.
In 617, Li Yuan rose in rebellion based in Taiyuan, and expanded quickly.

===Tang dynasty===
In 618, Li Yuan founded Tang dynasty, which is generally considered a golden age of Chinese civilization. Taiyuan expanded significantly during the Tang dynasty, partly because Taiyuan was the military base of the founding emperors Li Yuan and Li Shimin. As Li Shimin wrote in 619: &quot;Taiyuan, the base of the imperial regime and the foundation of the state.&quot; ()

In 690, Wu Zetian set Taiyuan as the Northern Capital, (), one of the three capitals, along with Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang, as depicted in the poem by Li Bai: &quot;The king of the heaven has three capitals, the Northern capital is one of them.&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In 742 AD, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang changed its name further to &quot;Beijing&quot; (). During the Tang dynasty, the title &quot;Northern Capital&quot; to Taiyuan had been endowed or abolished multiple times.

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms===
In 923, Li Cunxu, son of Li Keyong, founded Later Tang with capital of Daming, and soon conquered most of North China, and ended Later Liang. Afterwards, Li Cunxu moved the capital from Daming to Luoyang, and Taiyuan was set as a provisional capital, titled &quot;Beidu&quot; (北都, literally &#x27;Northern Capital&#x27;).

In 936, Shi Jingtang established Later Jin in Taiyuan with the help from Khitan Liao dynasty. The next year, Shi Jingtang moved the capital from Taiyuan to Luoyang, and then to Kaifeng, and Taiyuan became a provisional northern capital (&quot;Beijing&quot;) again. 

===Song dynasty===

Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu of Song ) established the Song dynasty and embarked on the campaign of re-unification of China. Using a power struggle at the Northern Han court Taizu moved against it in the late 968. By early 969 his armies encircled Taiyuan and defeated the reinforcements sent by the Khitan. However, an attempt to flood the city failed. The siege was lifted after three months, as heavy rains caused diseases in the besieging army, the supplies were running low, and another Khitan relief force was advancing towards the city.

Taizu launched the second invasion of Northern Han
in September 969, but the armies were recalled after his death (November 14,969).

Taizu&#x27;s brother Taizong subjugated the last independent kingdoms in the south of China by 978, and in 979 launched the third campaign
against the Northern Han and its overlord the Khitan state of Liao. Using the north-western route instead of the southern (used in the previous campaigns) the armies of Taizong defeated a
major Liao force. Isolated, the Northern Han resisted for only
fifteen days before surrendering. In contrast to the mild policies of his brother, Taizong dealt harshly with the city. He ordered the flooding of Taiyuan by releasing the Fen River, and set the city on fire. The former capital was downgraded from prefecture to county town status.

It was not until 982 that a new city was founded on the banks of the Fen River. The oldest existing building in Taiyuan today is the Temple of the Goddess () inside the Jin Ci Complex. It was originally built in 1023 and reconstructed in 1102.

From 1027 one of the two private markets for Tangut goods, particularly salt, operated in Taiyuan. During the Song period many people, including the family of chancellor Wang Anshi, migrated south.

===Jin dynasty===
The Jurchen Jin dynasty was founded in 1115, and in 1125, Taiyuan was conquered by Jin.

===Yuan dynasty===

The Mongol empire emerged in 1206 under the leadership of Genghis Khan, and it expanded quickly. In 1218, Taiyuan was conquered by the Mongol army led by General Muqali.
Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty in 1271, and the administrative area of Taiyuan Lu () was expanded.

The Taoist Longshan Grottoes was built in early Yuan dynasty, initiated by Taoist monk Song Defang ().

===Ming dynasty===

In 1368, Hongwu Emperor established the Ming dynasty, and Taiyuan was obtained from Yuan, by General Xu Da.

The Ming dynasty installed Nine Military Garrisons to defend the northern territory during the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor, which included the Garrison of Taiyuan ().

Shanxi merchants became prominent in Chinese business history since the beginning of Ming dynasty, thanks to the logistic requirements of the military around the borders of northern Shanxi to defend Ming against the remnant Mongol Northern Yuan dynasty.

===Qing dynasty===
In 1644, Shunzhi founded the Qing dynasty and defeated the Great Shun Army in Taiyuan in the same year.

Throughout the Qing dynasty, the international trade with Russia, especially of tea, and the creation and development of so-called draft banks, or &quot;Piaohao&quot;, boosted the central Shanxi basin to become the financial center of Qing China. Even though most of these Piaohao were based in different neighboring counties of Qi County, Taigu, and Yuci, Taiyuan became a significant trading center, due to its political and economical status in Shanxi.

In 1900, the Taiyuan Massacre occurred, during which a number of Western missionaries were killed.

===Republic of China===
The warlord Yan Xishan retained control of Shanxi from the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 to the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Taiyuan consequently flourished as the center of his comparatively progressive province and experienced extensive industrial development. It was linked by rail both to the far southwest of Shanxi and to Datong in the north. Until the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Yan&#x27;s arsenal in Taiyuan was the only factory in China sufficiently advanced to produce field artillery. Because Yan succeeded in keeping Shanxi uninvolved in most of the major battles between rival warlords that occurred in China during the 1910s and 1920s, Taiyuan was never taken from Yan by an invading army until the Japanese conquered it in 1937.

Yan was aware of the threat posed by the Japanese; and, in order to defend against the impending Japanese invasion of Shanxi, Yan entered into a secret &quot;united front&quot; agreement with the Communists in November 1936. After concluding his alliance with the Communists, he allowed agents under Zhou Enlai to establish a secret headquarters in Taiyuan. Yan, under the slogan &quot;resistance against the enemy and defense of the soil&quot;, attempted to recruit young patriotic intellectuals to his government from across China. By 1936 Taiyuan became a gathering point for anti-Japanese intellectuals who had fled from Beijing, Tianjin, and Northeast China. A representative of the Japanese army, speaking of the final defense of Taiyuan, said that &quot;nowhere in China have the Chinese fought so obstinately&quot;.

From the Japanese occupation of Taiyuan to the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Japanese continued to exploit Taiyuan&#x27;s industries and resources to supply the Japanese army. After the Japanese army in Shanxi surrendered to Yan Xishan, 10,000–15,000 Japanese troops, including both enlisted men and officers, decided to fight for Yan rather than return to Japan. Yan also retained the services of experienced and foreign-educated Japanese technicians and professional staff brought into Taiyuan by the Japanese to run the complex of industries that they had developed around Taiyuan.

Taiyuan was the last area in Shanxi to resist Communist control during the final stages of the Chinese Civil War. The city was taken by the Communists on 22 April 1949, after they surrounded Taiyuan and cut it off from all means of land and air supply, and taking the city required the support of 1,300 pieces of artillery. Many Nationalist officers committed suicide when the city fell to a Communist army.

Spring is dry, with occasional dust storms, followed by early summer heat waves. Summer tends to be warm to hot with most of the year&#x27;s rainfall concentrated in July and August. Winter is long and cold, but dry and sunny. Because of the aridity, there tends to be considerable diurnal variation in temperature, except during the summer. The weather is much cooler than comparable-latitude cities, such as Shijiazhuang, due to the moderately high altitude. The monthly 24-hour average temperature range from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 51 percent in July to 61 percent in May, there are 2,493 hours of sunshine annually.

====Air pollution====
Taiyuan had suffered from severe air pollution, especially in the 1990s, and the first decade of the 21st century, and once it was even listed among the ten most air-polluted cities in the world. Recently, the air quality has been gradually improved with increasing public awareness of air quality control and stricter and more detailed rules for pollution applied. However, according to the 2014 statistical book issued by the National Bureau of Statistics, even though no longer among the worst polluted cities in China, Taiyuan still has below-average ambient air quality, compared with other major Chinese cities. A 2019 study estimated that in 2016, there were 228,000 households in the city burning coal, burning a total of 1,096,000 tons that year alone. The authors of the study suggested that the local government should do more to transition from coal energy to gas energy, provide more electrical heating infrastructure, and transition to more renewable energy sources. In recent years, the city has taken further action to combat air pollution, creating a &quot;coal-free zone&quot; of 1,460 km2 in 2017. This zone prevents most people and organizations from buying, selling, storing, transporting, burning, or using coal. In 2019, the Taiyuan City Government expanded the size of this zone slightly, to a total of 1,574 km2.

<text>Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden () is a fictional character appearing in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. Drizzt was created by author R. A. Salvatore as a supporting character in the &quot;Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot;. Salvatore created him on a whim when his publisher needed him to replace one of the characters in an early version of the first book, &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;. Drizzt has since become a popular heroic character of the Forgotten Realms setting, and has been featured as the main character of a long series of books, starting chronologically with &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot;. As an atypical drow (dark elf), Drizzt has forsaken both the evil ways of his people and their home in the Underdark, in the drow city of Menzoberranzan.

Drizzt&#x27;s story is told in Salvatore&#x27;s fantasy novels in &quot;The Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot;, the &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; series, the &quot;Paths of Darkness&quot; series, &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Blades Trilogy&quot;, the &quot;Transitions&quot; series, and the &quot;Neverwinter Saga&quot;, as well as in the short stories &quot;The Dowry&quot;, &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Comrades at Odds&quot;. All of the novels featuring Drizzt have made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. A number of the novels have been adapted into graphic novels by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing. Drizzt has also been featured in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-based role-playing video games, including the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series and &quot;Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==
Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden&#x27;s stories are set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The character has been a mainstay for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 30 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt therefore fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.

Salvatore uses Drizzt to represent issues of racial prejudice, particularly in &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot;. For instance, Drizzt is concerned that if he and his love Cattie-Brie (a human) have children, their offspring will face hostility from both races. Drizzt is also troubled by the lifespan discrepancy between himself and Cattie-Brie.

Drizzt was created by happenstance. In 1987 R. A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then managing editor of TSR&#x27;s book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel &quot;Echoes of the Fourth Magic&quot;. She liked it, but asked if he could rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him &quot;Darkwalker on Moonshae&quot; by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to &quot;Darkwalker&quot;, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in a different part of the Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was &quot;set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time I thought that &quot;was&quot; the Realms. When I found out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north.&quot;

Salvatore created Drizzt on the spur of the moment. He was under pressure to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said &quot;not a chance&quot;. Recalling Drizzt&#x27;s creation in an interview, Salvatore said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!&quot; Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore&#x27;s main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. &quot;I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from &quot;Darkwalker on Moonshae&quot; and Aragorn from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; Salvatore calls Drizzt &quot;the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time.&quot;

== Publication history ==

Drizzt&#x27;s story begins in the novel &quot;Homeland&quot;, the start of &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; and published in 1990 as a prequel to &quot;The Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot;, which was published between 1988 and 1990. In the book, Drizzt is born in Menzoberranzan as the third son to Matron Malice, the leader of House Do&#x27;Urden (a type of family akin to a Scottish clan). His father is Zaknafein, a weapons master who secretly hates drow society and teaches Drizzt his martial skills as he reinforces Drizzt&#x27;s innate moral code. The 1996 short story &quot;The Fires of Narbondel&quot;, in the &quot;Realms of the Underdark&quot; anthology, describes unrelated events involving Zaknafein as the main character, and a young Drizzt plays a supporting role.

During a raid against a group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself unable to participate in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He pretends to kill an elf child, but actually helps her to escape. When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt&#x27;s stead to appease Lolth, the drow&#x27;s goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow ways and escapes Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. At this time he also acquires the statuette that allows him to summon the magical panther Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt&#x27;s side as he makes his way across the Realms.

Drizzt fights off the resurrected spirit-wraith of his father in &quot;Exile&quot;, the second book in the &quot;Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; and also published in 1990. &quot;Sojourn&quot; picks up the story when Drizzt leaves the Underdark for the surface, where he meets a blind human ranger named Montolio Debrouchee. When Montolio begins teaching him the ways of the ranger, Drizzt realizes that, unknowingly, he had been following those very principles his entire life. From then on Drizzt&#x27;s patron goddess is Mielikki, the Faerûnian goddess of the forest and of rangers. Montolio eventually dies, and Drizzt travels the Realms in search of a new home. He eventually finds himself in Icewind Dale where he meets dwarven king Bruenor Battlehammer, and Bruenor&#x27;s adopted human daughter, Catti-brie.

The fourth book chronologically in the series, although the first published, is &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (1988), the first in &quot;The Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot;. It describes Drizzt&#x27;s meeting with the barbarian Wulfgar and the halfling Regis, and their adventures as they stop Akar Kessel, a mage possessed by the sentient artifact Crenshinibon (the book&#x27;s eponymous Crystal Shard), from gaining control of the region. &quot;Streams of Silver&quot; (1989), tells the story of the group as they journey to Mithral Hall, Bruenor&#x27;s boyhood home. Artemis Entreri, a recurring character in the series, also makes his first appearance. In later books, Artemis is Drizzt&#x27;s equal in combat, and they clash often due to their conflicting views and goals. In the 1990 book &quot;The Halfling&#x27;s Gem&quot;, Artemis kidnaps Regis while in the employ of a powerful crime lord. Drizzt and Wulfgar chase the assassin by sea, with the help of Captain Deudermont, to recover Regis. Drizzt ends up in combat with Artemis Entreri, who leaves the battle wounded. At the end of the book the group finds Regis, and Guenhwyvar kills Artemis&#x27;s employer.

&quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; is a tetralogy, unlike the previous two trilogies. The 1993 short story, &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;, in the &quot;Realms of Valor&quot; anthology, describes events just prior to the series. The first three books, &quot;The Legacy&quot;, &quot;Starless Night&quot;, and &quot;Siege of Darkness&quot;, describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is seemingly slain by a yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the Time of Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends.

&quot;Passage to Dawn&quot;, the final book in the &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; series and published two years after &quot;Siege of Darkness&quot;, picks up the story six years after the drow attack. Drizzt and Catti-Brie work with Captain Deudermont on his pirate-hunting ship, with the Companions of the Hall ultimately fighting the powerful demon Errtu who is aided by the Crystal Shard, which had previously been buried under a mountain of snow. Wulfgar, never truly dead, returns to life from the Abyss as the demon who had held his soul was destroyed.

Drizzt is the main character in only two books of the &quot;Paths of Darkness&quot; series. &quot;The Silent Blade&quot; (1998) describes the group&#x27;s journey to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. &quot;Sea of Swords&quot; (2001) continues Drizzt&#x27;s story after the events of &quot;The Spine of the World&quot; (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and &quot;Servant of the Shard&quot; (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. &quot;Sea of Swords&quot; covers the companions&#x27; search for Wulfgar&#x27;s lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.

Drizzt returns as the main character throughout &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Blades Trilogy&quot;. In &quot;The Thousand Orcs&quot; (2002), Drizzt and his friends encounter the powerful orc Obould Many-Arrows, who has employed frost giants to aid him in gaining control of the region. After a battle at the town of Shallows, Drizzt believes the other Companions of the Hall to have fallen in battle, and he sets off into the wilderness to fight all orcs in vengeance. &quot;The Lone Drow&quot; (2003) continues this storyline as the still-living Companions protect Mithril Hall from orc attacks without the aid of Drizzt. He is reunited with his friends in &quot;The Two Swords&quot; (2003).

R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s next series of Forgotten Realms books, &quot;The Sellswords Trilogy&quot;, focus on the further adventures of Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle, with Drizzt only being mentioned in them. However, Drizzt is once again the main character in the &quot;Transitions&quot; trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Orc King&quot;, &quot;The Pirate King&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost King&quot;. Drizzt is the main character, along with Bruenor, in R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s next series in the Forgotten Realms, &quot;Neverwinter Saga&quot;; the first book in this series, &quot;Gauntlgrym&quot;, was released October 5, 2010. The second book in the series &quot;Neverwinter&quot;, was released October 4, 2011, with the third installment entitled &quot;Charon&#x27;s Claw&quot; released August 7, 2012. The fourth book in the series &quot;The Last Threshold&quot;, was released March 5, 2013.

== Other media ==
Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden has been featured in several accessories and one book for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. The &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot; accessory for the second edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, published in 1989, features a four-page description and game statistics for Drizzt and Guenhwyvar, written by R. A. Salvatore. The &quot;Heroes&#x27; Lorebook&quot; accessory, published in 1996 and written by Dale Donovan and Paul Culotta, features an update and revision of Drizzt&#x27;s information from &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot;. The 1999 accessory &quot;Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden&#x27;s Guide to the Underdark&quot; by Eric L. Boyd, details the cities and civilizations of Faerûn&#x27;s Underdark through the perspective of the title character. The &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; hardcover for the game&#x27;s third edition features a brief description and game statistics for Drizzt for this edition, under the section on the Sword Coast North.

Drizzt has also appeared in a number of graphic novels and video games, and as a miniature figure. Beginning in 2005, Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing began releasing comic book adaptations of the Drizzt novels, covering each book in a three-issue mini-series along with a trade paperback collection. To date, &quot;Homeland&quot;, &quot;Exile&quot;, &quot;Sojourn&quot;, &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, &quot;Streams of Silver&quot;, &quot;The Halfling&#x27;s Gem&quot;, &quot;The Legacy&quot;, and &quot;Starless Night&quot; have been released. The character has appeared in several video games. He is part of the story and a party member in the 1994 SSI game for PC &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot;. In &quot;Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone&quot; he is a playable character in the game&#x27;s seventh stage, described by a writer for Imagine Games Network (IGN) as &quot;cool but utterly ineffective.&quot; Drizzt appears in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; fighting some gnolls; it is possible for a skilled player to kill him or pickpocket his items, and a friendly or hostile version of Drizzt can be spawned with a cheat code. Drizzt also appears in the sequel &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; and will react negatively if the player has imported characters from the first game that killed Drizzt or has any of his unique items. He will also react negatively to any elven character with a low reputation with the same name, challenging them to a duel of honor. He is also an unlockable playable character in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot;. Drizzt is also included in the &quot;Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures&quot; game, in the &quot;Legend of Drizzt Scenario Pack&quot; that also includes Wulfgar and the dragon Icingdeath. An enclosed booklet lets players recreate the battle between Drizzt, Wulfgar, and the dragon. The boxed set was nominated for Best Miniature Product at the 2008 ENnies.

A special adventure set in Icewind Dale was featured as the centerpiece at the November 3, 2007, Worldwide &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; Game Day event, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the debut of Drizzt that was upcoming.

Drizzt made a brief cameo in the 2011 one-off comic &quot;Unit:E&quot;, produced by Hasbro as a potential concept for crossing over many of the franchises they owned; he is seen in a splash page amongst many other Hasbro-owned characters (including characters from &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot;, &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot;, &quot;Micronauts&quot;, &quot;Action Man&quot;, &quot;Battleship Galaxies&quot;, and even &quot;Candy Land&quot;), as summoned for &quot;Micronauts&quot; characters Biotron and Acroyear by the alien AI Synergy (a reimagined version of the AI from &quot;Jem&quot;).

Drizzt features prominently in the D&amp;D Adventure System Cooperative Play board game &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot;, released October 18, 2011.

Drizzt has also been seen in the game &quot;Neverwinter&quot; by Cryptic Studios. He appears as part of the &quot;Neverwinter: Underdark&quot; expansion that allows players to travel to the drow city of Menzoberranzan and play several quests written by R. A. Salvatore.

In 2021, Drizzt was featured on two cards in the &quot;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&quot; line from the &quot;&quot; collectible card game. &quot;Sleep Sound&quot; (2021) is a poem by R. A. Salvatore which received an animated short to promote the &quot;Summer Of Drizzt&quot; marketing campaign. The short features scenes from the story of Drizzt; it was narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch and animated by The Sequence Group.

== Reception and legacy ==
According to PopMatters&#x27; Andrew Welsh, Drizzt is Salvatore&#x27;s attempt to create a multifaceted character who faces internal struggles, in hopes of standing out from the drow, and fantasy fiction in general. Welsh feels that Salvatore fails in this regard, saying &quot;any blood Drizzt finds on his hands is quickly justified and most &#x27;internal&#x27; conflict is superficial at best.&quot; A review for &quot;Pyramid&quot; refers to Drizzt as the &quot;most famous denizen&quot; of Menzoberranzan, identifying him and the city as &quot;some of the most famous pieces of the Realms&quot;, while chroniclers of the game Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; in the book &quot;Art &amp; Arcana: A Visual History&quot; counted him among the &quot;iconic D&amp;D characters&quot;. Rob Bricken of Kotaku called Drizzt &quot;one of the Mary Sue-iest characters in all of fiction&quot;.

The Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden books are popular with fantasy fans, and the Drizzt character is author R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s best known creation. All 34 novels featuring Drizzt by Salvatore have made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, starting with &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;. &quot;The Orc King&quot;, which marked the 20th anniversary of the character, made it to #7 on the list, as well as #9 on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; list, #6 on the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; bestseller list, and #36 on the &quot;USA Today&quot; list of top sellers.

&quot;The Two Swords&quot; peaked at #4 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in 2004. It reached the top of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s hardcover bestseller list after only two weeks, a record for its publisher Wizards of the Coast. It also debuted at #4 on The New York Times&#x27;s bestseller list and #2 on Publishers Weekly bestseller list.

&quot;The Lone Drow&quot; debuted at #7 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in October 2003. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;The Lone Drow&quot; was clichéd, but that some of the characters did achieve &quot;some complexity&quot;. They singled out two characters for praise: Innovindel, an elf who talks &quot;pensively&quot; of her long life in contrast to the short lived humans, and Obould the orc king.

Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden was #3 on &quot;Game Rant&quot;&#x27;s 2020 &quot;10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome&quot; list — the article states that &quot;A skilled ranger in his own right, Drizzt remains equally-adept in conversation. He&#x27;s always wary of danger, strives for perfection, and held himself to the highest standard. Meeting one of the most iconic figures in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; could help make players feel important in their campaign.&quot;

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, in his review of &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, Rob Bricken referred to Drizzt as &quot;arguably the most famous and beloved D&amp;D character of all time&quot; and noted that Wizards of the Coast had finally begun combatting the stereotype of the drow as a &quot;super-evil, subterranean race&quot;, which Drizzt forsakes &quot;to become a noble Ranger on the surface world&quot;. Bricken noted that &quot;Drizzt ends up overshadowing almost everyone and everything&quot; but comments that &quot;Drizzt and Wulfgar are so preternaturally badass they beat 25 giants by themselves (well, with help from Drizzt&#x27;s magic panther Guenhwyvar, because of course he has a magic panther pal)&quot;. In his review of &quot;Homeland&quot;, Bricken explained that &quot;when Salvatore introduced Drizzt in 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, players/readers who hadn&#x27;t been bothered this by were forced to acknowledge the correlation because characters in the Forgotten Realms judged Drizzt by the color of his skin. He was distrusted, despised, and discriminated against, often even by those he helped.&quot;

<text>In the PRINCE2 project management method, a product description (PDD) is a structured format that presents information about a project product. It is a management product (document), usually created by the project manager during the process of initiating a project in the initial stage of the PRINCE2 project management method. It is approved by the project board as part of the project plan documentation.

It should not be confused with a project product description(PPD), which (in the PRINCE2 method) is generated in the start up process of the pre-project stage, and forms part of the Project Brief. 
While the PPD is related to &quot;finalist products&quot;—those delivered to the client at the end of the project—the PDD refers to all project products, including intermediate products necessary in the project life that need definition.
For example, in a project to build a plane wing, the finalist product is the actual wing, and has acceptance criteria defined in the corresponding PPD. However, the project may require simulations, and even a wind-tunnel prototype and testing rig. Those are intermediate products, not handed or delivered to the client. However they are still subject to definitions and quality criteria that is detailed in the corresponding PDDs. Therefore, all product contained in the PPD are also in the PDDs, but not the other way.

The structure of product description, according to PRINCE2:
* Identifier
* Title
* Purpose
* Composition
* Derivation
* Format and presentation
* Development Skill Required
* Quality criteria
* Quality tolerances
* Quality method
* Quality skills required
* Quality Responsibilities

<doc id="401098" wikidata="Q568917" url="?curid=401098" title="Maghrib (prayer)">
<text>Maghrib () is one of the five mandatory salah (Islamic prayers), and contains three cycles (&quot;rak&#x27;a&quot;). If counted from midnight, it is the fourth one.

According to Sunni Muslims, the period for Maghrib prayer starts just after sunset, following Asr prayer, and ends at the beginning of night, the start of the Isha prayer. As for Shia Muslims, since they allow Maghrib and Isha prayers to be performed one after another, the period for Maghrib prayer extends until midnight. Except for the Hanafi school, however, Sunni Muslims are also permitted to combine Maghrib and Isha prayers if they are traveling and incapable of performing the prayers separately. In this case, the period for Maghrib prayer extends from sunset to dawn, as with Shiites. Amongst Sunnis, Salafis allow the combining of two consecutive prayers (&quot;Maghrib&quot; &amp; &quot;Isha&#x27;a&quot;, &quot;Dhuhr&quot; &amp; &quot;&#x27;Asr&quot;) for a wide range of reasons; such as when various needs arise or due to any difficulty (taking precedence from Hanbali and Shafiite schools).

The formal daily prayers of Islam comprise different numbers of units, called &quot;rakat&quot;. The Maghrib prayer has three obligatory (&quot;fard&quot;) rak&#x27;at and two &quot;sunnah&quot; and two non-obligatory . The first two fard rak&#x27;ats are prayed aloud by the Imam in congregation (the person who misses the congregation and is offering prayer alone is not bound to speak the first two rak&#x27;ats aloud), and the third is prayed silently.

To be considered valid &quot;salat&quot;, the formal daily prayers must each be performed within their own prescribed time period. People with a legitimate reason have a longer period during which their prayers will be valid.

The five daily prayers collectively are one pillar of the Five Pillars of Islam, in Sunni Islam, and one of the ten Practices of the Religion (&quot;Furū al-Dīn&quot;) according to Shia Islam.

==Name variations==
==Sunni tradition==
Time begins
*When the sun has completely set beneath the horizon; immediately after the Asr prayer period ends.

Time ends 
*Most scholarly opinions follow the Hanafi school, that Isha&#x27;a begins when complete darkness has arrived and the yellow twilight in the sky has disappeared.
*According to a minority opinion in the Maliki school, the prescribed time for Maghrib prayer ends when the red thread has disappeared from the sky. In another opinion of the Shafi&#x27;i school, the disappearance of the red thread marks the end of the Period of Necessity. These times can be approximated by using the sun as a measure. When the sun has descended 12 degrees below the horizon, it is approximately equivalent to the disappearance of the red from the sky. For approximating when complete darkness begins, i.e. the disappearance of the white thread from the sky, some astronomers argue that it occurs when the sun has descended 15 degrees below the horizon while others use the safer number of 18 degrees. Astronomical twilight occurs when the sun is between 12 degrees and 18 degrees below the horizon.

==Shia tradition==
Time begins
* When the redness of the eastern sky, which persists in the east for some time after sunset, disappears from above one&#x27;s head when one looks vertically upwards.

Time ends
* At midnight. The end of its time is after approximately eleven-and-a-quarter hours have passed from the legal noontime. This is for when one is under normal circumstances. However, in the case of one who was asleep, or forgot to perform the prayer or was coerced by extraordinary circumstances or factors beyond his control or in the case of a woman whose prayer was delayed due to menstruation, the end of the Maghrib prayer time is Fajr.

Despite the relatively long period in which valid prayers can be recited, it is considered important to recite the prayer as soon as the time begins.

Shia doctrine permits the mid-day and afternoon and evening and night prayers to be prayed in succession, i.e. Zuhr can be followed by Asr once the mid-day prayer has been recited and sufficient time has passed, and Maghrib can be followed by Isha&#x27;a once the evening prayer has been recited and sufficient time has passed.

During Ramadan, the maghrib prayer marks the end of the fast and is the start of the iftar.

<text>Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (5 January 1928 – 4 April 1979) was a Pakistani barrister, politician, and statesman. He served as the fourth president of Pakistan from 1971 to 1973 and later as the ninth prime minister of Pakistan from 1973 to 1977. Bhutto founded the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP) and served as its chairman until his execution for murder.

Born in Sindh and educated at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Oxford, Bhutto trained as a barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn before entering politics. Initially, he was a cabinet member during president Iskandar Ali Mirza&#x27;s tenure, holding various ministries during president Ayub Khan&#x27;s military rule from 1958. Bhutto became the Foreign Minister in 1963, advocating for Operation Gibraltar in Kashmir, leading to the 1965 war with India. Following the Tashkent Declaration, he was dismissed from the government. Bhutto established the PPP in 1967, focusing on an Islamic socialist agenda, and contested the 1970 general election. The Awami League and PPP were unable to agree on power transfer, leading to civil unrest and the creation of Bangladesh. After Pakistan&#x27;s loss in the 1971 war against Bangladesh, Bhutto assumed the presidency in December 1971, imposing emergency rule.

During his presidency, Bhutto secured the release of 93,000 prisoners of war and reclaimed of Indian-held territory through the Simla Agreement. He strengthened diplomatic ties with China and Saudi Arabia, recognized Bangladesh, and hosted the second Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Lahore in 1974. Bhutto&#x27;s government drafted the current constitution of Pakistan in 1973, after which he transitioned to the prime minister&#x27;s office. He played a crucial role in initiating the country&#x27;s nuclear program. However, his policies, including extensive nationalisation, led to economic stagnation.

Despite winning the 1977 parliamentary elections, Bhutto faced allegations of widespread vote rigging, sparking violence across the country. On 5 July 1977, Bhutto was deposed in a military coup by army chief Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Controversially tried and executed in 1979, Bhutto&#x27;s legacy remains contentious, praised for nationalism and a secular internationalist agenda, yet criticized for political repression, economic challenges, and human rights abuses. He is often considered one of Pakistan&#x27;s greatest leaders. His party, the PPP, continues to be a significant political force in Pakistan, with his daughter Benazir Bhutto serving twice as Prime Minister, and his son-in-law, Asif Ali Zardari, becoming president.

== Early life and education ==
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto belonged to a Sindhi Rajput family; Owen Bennett-Jones writes that the family traces its ancestry back to a 9th-century Rajput prince of the Bhati clan who ruled the town of Tanot (in current-day Rajasthan, India), Bhutto&#x27;s ancestors later appearing in different Rajasthani chronicles in prominent roles, the family converting to Islam mostly around the 17th century before moving to Sindh.

He was born to Shah Nawaz Bhutto and Khursheed Begum near Larkana. His father was the &quot;dewan&quot; of the princely state of Junagadh and enjoyed an influential relationship with the officials of the British Raj.

His mother Khursheed Begum was born Lakhi Bai; and had been a professional dance girl into a Hindu family but converted to Islam when she married Shah Nawaz. Reportedly, Shah Nawaz Bhutto had seen her dancing; and had proposed her, eventually marrying her.

Zulfikar was their third child—their first one, Sikandar Ali, had died from pneumonia at age seven in 1914, and the second, Imdad Ali, died of cirrhosis at age 39 in 1953.

As a young boy, Bhutto moved to Worli Seaface in Bombay to study at the Cathedral and John Connon School, later St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai. He then also became an activist in the Pakistan Movement. In 1943, his marriage was arranged with Shireen Amir Begum. In 1947, Bhutto was admitted to the University of Southern California to study political science.

In 1949, as a sophomore, Bhutto transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a B.A. (honours) degree in political science in 1950. A year later on 8 September 1951, he married a woman of Iranian Kurdish origin—Nusrat Ispahani, popularly known as Begum Nusrat Bhutto. During his studies at the University of California, Berkeley, Bhutto became interested in the theories of socialism, delivering a series of lectures on their feasibility in Islamic countries. During this time, Bhutto&#x27;s father played a controversial role in the affairs of Junagadh. Coming to power in a palace coup, he secured the accession of his state to Pakistan, which was ultimately negated by Indian intervention in December 1947. In June 1950, Bhutto travelled to the United Kingdom to study law at Christ Church, Oxford and received a BA in jurisprudence, followed by an LLM degree in law and an M.Sc. (honours) degree in political science. Upon finishing his studies, he served as a lecturer in international law at the University of Southampton in 1952, and he was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1953.

== Political career ==
In 1957, Bhutto became the youngest member of Pakistan&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations. He addressed the UN Sixth Committee on Aggression that October and led Pakistan&#x27;s delegation to the first UN Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958. That year, Bhutto became Pakistan&#x27;s youngest cabinet minister, taking up the reins of the Ministry of Commerce by President Iskander Mirza, pre-&quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; government. In 1960, he was promoted to Minister of Water and Power, Communications and Industry. Bhutto became a trusted ally and advisor of Ayub Khan, rising in influence and power despite his youth and relative inexperience. Bhutto aided his president in negotiating the Indus Water Treaty in India in 1960 and the next year negotiated an oil-exploration agreement with the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide economic and technical aid to Pakistan.

=== Foreign minister ===
Bhutto, a Pakistani nationalist and socialist, held distinctive views on the democracy required in Pakistan. Upon becoming foreign minister in 1963, his socialist stance led to a close relationship with neighboring China, challenging the prevailing acceptance of Taiwan as the legitimate government of China when two governments each claimed to be &quot;China&quot;. In 1964, the Soviet Union and its satellite states broke off relations with Beijing over ideological differences, with only Albania and Pakistan supporting the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Bhutto staunchly supported Beijing in the UN and the UNSC, while also maintaining connections with the United States. Bhutto&#x27;s strong advocacy for closer ties with China drew criticism from the United States, with President Lyndon B. Johnson cautioning him about potential repercussions on congressional support for aid to Pakistan. Bhutto, known for his demagogic speeches, led the foreign ministry assertively, rapidly gaining national prominence. During a visit to Beijing, Bhutto, along with his staff, received a warm welcome from the Chinese leadership, including Mao Zedong. Bhutto contributed to negotiating trade and military agreements between Pakistan and China, fostering collaboration on various military and industrial projects.

Bhutto signed the Sino-Pakistan Boundary Agreement on 2 March 1963, transferring 750 square kilometers of territory from Gilgit Baltistan to Chinese control. Bhutto embraced non-alignment, making Pakistan an influential member in non-aligned organizations. Advocating pan-Islamic unity, Bhutto developed closer relations with Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Bhutto significantly transformed Pakistan&#x27;s pro-West foreign policy. While maintaining a role in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, Bhutto asserted an independent foreign policy for Pakistan, free from U.S. influence. During visits to both East and West Germany, Bhutto established strong links and pursued economic, technological, industrial, and military agreements. He strengthened Pakistan&#x27;s strategic alliance with Germany, emphasizing the importance of Pakistan-German relations in a farewell speech at the University of Munich. Bhutto also visited Poland in 1962, establishing diplomatic relations and fostering mutual cooperation, reaching out to the Polish community in Pakistan. Using Pakistan Air Force&#x27;s Brigadier-General Władysław Turowicz, Bhutto initiated military and economic links between Pakistan and Poland.

In 1962, as territorial differences escalated between India and China, Beijing considered staging an invasion in northern Indian territories. Premier Zhou Enlai and Mao invited Pakistan to join the raid to reclaim the State of Jammu and Kashmir from India. Bhutto supported the plan, but Ayub opposed it due to fears of Indian retaliation. Instead, Ayub proposed a &quot;joint defense union&quot; with India, shocking Bhutto, who felt Ayub Khan lacked understanding of international affairs. Bhutto, aware of China&#x27;s restraint from criticizing Pakistan despite its membership in anti-communist western alliances, criticized the U.S. for providing military aid to India during and after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, seen as a breach of Pakistan&#x27;s alliance with the United States.

On Bhutto&#x27;s counsel, Ayub Khan launched Operation Gibraltar in an attempt to &quot;liberate&quot; Kashmir. The operation failed, leading to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. This war followed brief skirmishes between March and August 1965 in the Rann of Kutch, Jammu and Kashmir, and Punjab. Bhutto joined Ayub in Uzbekistan to negotiate a peace treaty with Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Ayub and Shastri agreed to exchange prisoners of war and withdraw respective forces to pre-war boundaries. The agreement, deeply unpopular in Pakistan, caused significant political unrest against Ayub&#x27;s regime. Bhutto&#x27;s criticism of the final agreement created a major rift with Ayub. Initially denying rumors, Bhutto resigned in June 1966, expressing strong opposition to Ayub&#x27;s regime.

During his term, Bhutto formulated aggressive geostrategic and foreign policies against India. In 1965, Bhutto received information from his friend Munir Ahmad Khan about the status of India&#x27;s nuclear program. Bhutto stated, &quot;Pakistan will fight, fight for a thousand years. If India builds the (atom) bomb, Pakistan will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we (Pakistan) will get one of our own (atom bomb)... We (Pakistan) have no other choice!&quot; In his 1969 book &quot;The Myth of Independence,&quot; Bhutto argued for the necessity of Pakistan acquiring a fission weapon and starting a deterrence program to stand up to industrialized states and a nuclear-armed India. He developed a manifesto outlining the program&#x27;s development and selected Munir Ahmad Khan to lead it.

== Pakistan People&#x27;s Party ==
After resigning as foreign minister, large crowds gathered to hear Bhutto&#x27;s speech upon his arrival in Lahore on 21 June 1967. Riding a wave of anger against Ayub, Bhutto traveled across Pakistan, delivering political speeches. In October 1966, Bhutto explicitly outlined the beliefs of his new party: &quot;Islam is our faith, democracy is our policy, socialism is our economy. All power to the people.&quot;

On 30 November 1967, at the Lahore residence of Mubashir Hassan, a gathering including Bhutto, political activist Sufi Nazar Muhammad Khan, Bengali communist J. A. Rahim, and Basit Jehangir Sheikh founded the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), establishing a strong base in Punjab, Sindh, and among the Muhajirs.

Mubashir Hassan, an engineering professor at UET Lahore, played a pivotal role in the success and rise of Bhutto. Under Hassan&#x27;s guidance and Bhutto&#x27;s leadership, the PPP became part of the pro-democracy movement involving diverse political parties from all across Pakistan. PPP activists staged large protests and strikes in different parts of the country, increasing pressure on Ayub to resign.

Asghar Khan recalls Bhutto asking him to join his party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Asghar Khan declined, stating he had no interest in politics. After Dr. Hassan and Bhutto&#x27;s arrest on 12 November 1968, Asghar Khan held a press conference in Lahore on 17 November 1968. Asghar Khan led protests calling for Bhutto&#x27;s release, which ultimately led to his freedom and grew so close to Bhutto that many saw him as a potential successor.

After his release, Bhutto, joined by key leaders of PPP, attended the Round Table Conference called by Ayub Khan in Rawalpindi but refused to accept Ayub&#x27;s continuation in office and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s Six point movement for regional autonomy.

=== 1970 elections ===

Following Ayub&#x27;s resignation, his successor, General Yahya Khan promised to hold parliamentary elections on 7 December 1970. Under Bhutto&#x27;s leadership, the democratic socialists, leftists, and Marxist-communists gathered and united into one party platform for the first time in Pakistan&#x27;s history. The Socialist-Communist bloc, under Bhutto&#x27;s leadership, intensified its support in Muhajir and poor farming communities in West Pakistan, working through educating people to cast their vote for their better future. Gathering and uniting the scattered socialist-communist groups in one single center was considered Bhutto&#x27;s greatest political achievement and as a result, Bhutto&#x27;s party and other leftists won a large number of seats from constituencies in West-Pakistan. However, Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s Awami League won an absolute majority in the legislature, receiving more than twice as many votes as Bhutto&#x27;s PPP. Bhutto strongly refused to accept an Awami League government and infamously threatened to &quot;&quot;break the legs&quot; of any elected PPP member who dared to attend the inaugural session of the National Assembly. On 17 January 1971, President Yahya visited Bhutto at his baronial family estate, Al-Murtaza, in Larkana, Sindh, accompanied by Lt. General S. G. M. Pirzada, Principal Staff Officer to President Yahya, and General Abdul Hamid Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. On February 22, 1971, the generals in West Pakistan took a decision allegedly to crush the Awami League and its supporters. Capitalizing on West Pakistani fears of East Pakistani separatism, Bhutto demanded that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman form a coalition with the PPP. And at some stage proposed &quot;idhar hum, udhar tum&quot;&quot;, meaning he should govern the West and Mujib should Govern the East. President Yahya postponed the meeting of the national assembly which fueled a popular movement in East Pakistan. Amidst popular outrage in East Pakistan, on 7 March 1971, Sheikh Mujib called the Bengalis to join the struggle for &quot;Bangladesh&quot;. According to historical references and a report published by the leading Pakistani newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Mujib no longer believed in Pakistan and is determined to make Bangladesh&quot;. Many also believed that Bhutto wanted power in the West even at the expense of the separation of the East. However, Mujib still kept doors open for some sort of settlement in his speech of 7 March.

=== Fall of East Pakistan ===
Yahya started a negotiating conference in Dhaka, presumably to reach a settlement between Bhutto and Mujib. The discussion was expected to be &quot;fruitful&quot; until the president left for West Pakistan on the evening of 25 March. On that night of 25 March 1971, the army initiated Operation Searchlight, which had been planned by the military junta of Yahya Khan, presumably to suppress political activities and movements by the Bengalis. Mujib was arrested and imprisoned in West Pakistan. Genocide and atrocities by the military against the Bengali population were alleged during the operation.
Bhutto stayed in Dhaka on the night of 25 March and commented that Pakistan had been saved by the army before leaving on the 26th. While supportive of the army&#x27;s actions and working to rally international support, Bhutto distanced himself from the Yahya Khan regime and began to criticize Yahya Khan for mishandling the situation. He refused to accept Yahya Khan&#x27;s scheme to appoint Bengali politician Nurul Amin as Prime Minister, with Bhutto as deputy prime minister. Soon after Bhutto&#x27;s refusal and continuous resentment toward General Yahya Khan&#x27;s mishandling of the situation, Khan ordered Military Police to arrest Bhutto on charges of treason, quite similar to Mujib. Bhutto was imprisoned in the Adiala Jail along with Mujib, where he was set to face the charges. The army crackdown on the Bengalis of East Pakistan fueled an armed resistance by the Mukti-Bahini (a guerrilla force formed for the campaign of an independent Bangladesh and trained by the Indian army). Pakistan launched an air attack on India in the western border that resulted in the Indian intervention in East Pakistan, which led to the very bitter defeat of Pakistani forces, who surrendered on 16 December 1971. Consequently, the state of People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh was born, and Bhutto and others condemned Yahya Khan for failing to protect Pakistan&#x27;s unity. Isolated, Yahya Khan resigned on 20 December and transferred power to Bhutto, who became president, commander-in-chief, and the first civilian chief martial law administrator.

Bhutto was the country&#x27;s first civilian chief martial law administrator since 1958, as well as the country&#x27;s first civilian president. With Bhutto assuming control, the leftists and democratic socialists entered the country&#x27;s politics and later emerged as power players in the country&#x27;s politics. And, for the first time in the country&#x27;s history, the leftists and democratic socialists had a chance to administer the country with the popular vote and widely approved exclusive mandate, given to them by the West&#x27;s population in the 1970s elections.

In a reference written by Kuldip Nayar in his book &quot;Scoop! Inside Stories from the Partition to the Present&quot;, Nayar noted that &quot;Bhutto&#x27;s releasing of Mujib did not mean anything to Pakistan&#x27;s policy as in if there was no liberation war. Bhutto&#x27;s policy, and even as of today, the policy of Pakistan continues to state that &quot;she will continue to fight for the honor and integrity of Pakistan. East Pakistan is an inseparable and unseverable part of Pakistan&quot;. When Bhutto set about rebuilding Pakistan, he stated his intention was to &quot;rebuild confidence and rebuild hope for the future&quot;.

== Presidency (1971–1973) ==
A Pakistan International Airlines flight was sent to fetch Bhutto from New York City, where he was presenting Pakistan&#x27;s case before the United Nations Security Council on the East Pakistan Crisis. Bhutto returned home on 18 December 1971. On 20 December, he was taken to the President House in Rawalpindi, where he took over two positions from Yahya Khan, one as president and the other as the first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator. Thus, he was the first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator of the dismembered Pakistan. By the time Bhutto had assumed control of what remained of Pakistan, the nation was completely isolated, angered, and demoralized. Bhutto addressing the nation through radio and television said:

My dear countrymen, my dear friends, my dear students, labourers, peasants... those who fought for Pakistan... We are facing the worst crisis in our country&#x27;s life, a deadly crisis. We have to pick up the pieces, very small pieces, but we will make a new Pakistan, a prosperous and progressive Pakistan, a Pakistan free of exploitation, a Pakistan envisaged by the Quaid-e-Azam.

As president, Bhutto faced mounting challenges on both internal and foreign fronts. The trauma was severe in Pakistan, a psychological setback and emotional breakdown for Pakistan. The two-nation theory—the theoretical basis for the creation of Pakistan—lay discredited, and Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy collapsed when no moral support was found anywhere, including long-standing allies such as the U.S. and China. However, this is disputed even by Bangladeshi academics who insist that the two-nation theory was not discredited. Since her creation, the physical and moral existence of Pakistan was in great danger. On the internal front, Baloch, Sindhi, Punjabi, and Pashtun nationalisms were at their peak, calling for their independence from Pakistan. Finding it difficult to keep Pakistan united, Bhutto launched full-fledged intelligence and military operations to stamp out any separatist movements. By the end of 1978, these nationalist organizations were brutally quelled by Pakistan Armed Forces.

Bhutto immediately placed Yahya Khan under house arrest, brokered a ceasefire, and ordered the release of Sheikh Mujib, who was held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. To implement this, Bhutto reversed the verdict of Mujib&#x27;s earlier court-martial trial, in which Brigadier Rahimuddin Khan had sentenced Mujib to death. Bhutto wanted through dialogue prevent Bangladesh&#x27;s cessation and create a loose confederation within the confines of one Pakistan. Stanley Wolpert writes that he sent Sheikh Mujib ur Rehman to a bungalow in Rawalpindi where he swore upon the Quran to retire and to give him the nation. He also offered 50,000 which Mujib declined. Mujib informed Bhutto that he&#x27;ll make this decision once he arrives in Bangladesh, On January 8th, He was flown to London from which he was taken to Delhi from where Indira Gandhi and her cabinet would greet him. It was from here he was taken to Dhaka, Since a flight directly to Bangladesh was impossible. Here he would give a speech in Ramna Racecourse, Completely rejecting Bhutto&#x27;s offer and severing ties with West-Pakistan stating, &quot;You live in peace and let us live in peace&quot;. 

=== Economic Policies ===
Appointing a new cabinet, Bhutto appointed Lieutenant-General Gul Hasan as Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army in 20 December 1971. On 2 January 1972 Bhutto announced the nationalization of all major industries, including iron and steel, automobiles, heavy engineering, heavy electricals, petrochemicals, cement, and public utilities. Bhutto had named his economic policies Islamic Socialism or as he called &quot;Mussawat-e Muhammadi&quot;. 31 industries across 10 sectors were nationalized including 13 banks, 10 shipping companies, 26 Vegetable Oil Companies, Two petroleum companies and 43 insurance companies which were tied together into State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan. Ayub Khan&#x27;s Ghandhara Industries, Sharif owned Ittefaq Foundry, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited were also nationalized. This wave of nationalization didn&#x27;t effect textile production light and food industries. In addition to foreign owned companies, Such as the British Attock Petroleum Company and American owned Esso Fertilizers. A new labour policy was announced increasing workers&#x27; rights and the power of trade unions. Although he came from a feudal background himself, Bhutto announced his first reforms in 1972 which is also called Martial Law Regulation (MLR-115). As Bhutto came as a Populist leader, his charismatic politics were evident. Consequently, he put a ceiling on land ownership wherein no one can hold more than 200 acres irrigated and more than 300 acres non-irrigated land. Bhutto also dismissed the military chiefs on 3 March after they refused orders to suppress a major police strike in Punjab. He appointed General Tikka Khan as the new Chief of the Army Staff in March 1972 as he felt the general would not interfere in political matters and would concentrate on rehabilitating the Pakistan Army. Bhutto convened the National Assembly on 14 April, rescinded martial law on 21 April, and charged the legislators with writing a new constitution.

=== Simla Agreement ===
In June 1972, Bhutto visited India to meet Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and negotiated a formal peace agreement and the release of 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war. The two leaders signed the Simla Agreement, which committed both nations to establish a new-yet-temporary Line of Control in Kashmir and obligated them to resolve disputes peacefully through bilateral talks. Bhutto also promised to hold a future summit for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute and pledged to recognize Bangladesh. Although he secured the release of Pakistani soldiers held by India, Bhutto was criticized by many in Pakistan for allegedly making too many concessions to India. It is theorized that Bhutto feared his downfall if he could not secure the release of Pakistani soldiers and the return of territory occupied by Indian forces. Bhutto established an atomic power development program and inaugurated the first Pakistani atomic reactor, built in collaboration with Canada in Karachi on 28 November. On 30 March, 59 military officers were arrested by army troops for allegedly plotting a coup against Bhutto, who appointed then-Brigadier Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to head a military tribunal to investigate and try the suspects. The National Assembly approved the new 1973 Constitution, which Bhutto signed into effect on 12 April. The constitution proclaimed an &quot;Islamic Republic&quot; in Pakistan with a parliamentary form of government. On 10 August, Bhutto turned over the post of president to Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry, assuming the office of prime minister instead.

=== Nuclear weapons program ===


Bhutto, the founder of Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb program, earned the title &quot;Father of Nuclear Deterrence&quot; due to his administration and aggressive leadership of this program. Bhutto&#x27;s interest in nuclear technology began during his college years in the United States, attending a political science course discussing the political impact of the U.S.&#x27;s first nuclear test, &quot;Trinity&quot;, on global politics. While at Berkeley, Bhutto witnessed the public panic when the Soviet Union first exploded their bomb, codenamed &quot;First Lightning&quot; in 1949, prompting the U.S. government to launch their research on &#x27;hydrogen&#x27; bombs. However, in 1958, as Minister for Fuel, Power, and National Resources, Bhutto played a key role in setting up the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) administrative research bodies and institutes. Soon, Bhutto offered a technical post to Munir Ahmad Khan in PAEC in 1958 and lobbied for Abdus Salam to be appointed as Science Adviser in 1960. Before being elevated to Foreign Minister, Bhutto directed funds for key research in nuclear weapons and related science.

In October 1965, as the Foreign Minister, Bhutto visited Vienna, where nuclear engineer Munir Ahmad Khan held a senior technical post at the IAEA. Munir Khan briefed him on the status of the Indian nuclear programme and the options for Pakistan to develop its own nuclear capability. Both agreed on the necessity for Pakistan to establish a nuclear deterrent against India. Although Munir Khan had failed to convince Ayub Khan, Bhutto assured him, &quot;&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, our turn will come&quot;.&quot; Shortly after the 1965 war, Bhutto declared at a press conference, &quot;&quot;Even if we have to eat grass, we will make a nuclear bomb. We have no other choice&quot;,&quot; observing India&#x27;s progress toward developing the bomb. In 1965, Bhutto advocated for Salam, successfully appointing him as the head of Pakistan&#x27;s delegation at the IAEA, and assisted Salam in lobbying for nuclear power plants. In November 1972, Bhutto advised Salam to travel to the United States to avoid the war and encouraged him to return with key literature on nuclear weapons history. By the end of December 1972, Salam returned to Pakistan with suitcases loaded with literature on the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;. In 1974, Bhutto initiated a more aggressive diplomatic offensive on the United States and the Western world over nuclear issues. Writing to world and Western leaders, Bhutto conveyed:

Roughly two weeks after the 1971 winter war, on 20 January 1972, Bhutto convened a conference of nuclear scientists and engineers at Multan. While at the Multan meeting, scientists wondered why the President, who had much on his hands in those trying days, was paying so much attention to scientists and engineers in the nuclear field. At the meeting, Bhutto slowly discussed the recent war and the country&#x27;s future, emphasizing the great mortal danger the country faced. As the academicians listened carefully, Bhutto stated, &quot;Look, we&#x27;re going to have the bomb&quot;. He asked them, &quot;Can you give it to me? And how long will it take to make a bomb?&quot; Many senior scientists, emotionally and psychologically disturbed from witnessing the war, responded positively, saying, &quot;Oh...Yes.. Yes... You can have it&quot;. A lively debate ensued on the time needed to make the bomb, and finally, one scientist dared to suggest that maybe it could be done in five years. Prime Minister Bhutto smiled, lifted his hand, and dramatically thrust forward three fingers, saying, &quot;Three years, I want it in three years&quot;. The atmosphere suddenly became electric. It was then that one of the junior scientists, Siddique Ahmad Butt (a theoretical physicist), who, under Munir Khan&#x27;s guiding hand, would come to play a major role in making the fission weapon possible, jumped to his feet and clamored for his leader&#x27;s attention. Siddique Ahmad Butt replied, &quot;It can be done in three years&quot;. When Bhutto heard Butt&#x27;s reply, he was very much amused and said, &quot;Well... Much as I appreciate your enthusiasm, this is a very serious political decision, which Pakistan must make, and perhaps all Third World countries must make one day, because it is coming. So can you boys do it?&quot;. Nearly all senior scientists replied in one tone, &quot;Yes... We can do it, given the resources and given the facilities&quot;. Bhutto ended the meeting by simply saying, &quot;I shall find you the resources and I shall find you the facilities&quot;.

Before the 1970s, nuclear deterrence was well-established under the government of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, but it was entirely peaceful and dedicated to civilian power needs. Bhutto, in his book &quot;The Myth of Independence&quot; in 1969, wrote:

After India&#x27;s nuclear test—codenamed &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;—in May 1974, Bhutto sensed and saw this test as the final anticipation for Pakistan&#x27;s death. In a press conference held shortly after India&#x27;s nuclear test, Bhutto said, &quot;India&#x27;s nuclear program is designed to intimidate Pakistan and establish &quot;&quot;hegemony in the subcontinent&quot;. Despite Pakistan&#x27;s limited financial resources, Bhutto was so enthusiastic about the nuclear energy project that he is reported to have said &quot;Pakistanis will eat grass but make a nuclear bomb&quot;&quot;.

The militarization of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission was initiated on 20 January 1972 and, in its initial years, was implemented by Pakistan Army&#x27;s Chief of Army Staff General Tikka Khan. The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP-I) was inaugurated by Bhutto during his role as the President of Pakistan at the end of 1972. The nuclear weapons program was set up loosely based on the Manhattan Project of the 1940s under the administrative control of Bhutto. Senior academic scientists had direct access to Bhutto, who kept him informed about every inch of the development. Bhutto&#x27;s Science Advisor, Abdus Salam&#x27;s office was also set up in Bhutto&#x27;s Prime Minister Secretariat. On Bhutto&#x27;s request, Salam had established and led the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) that marked the beginning of the nuclear deterrent program. The TPG designed and developed the nuclear weapons as well as the entire program. Later, Munir Ahmad Khan had him personally approved the budget for the development of the programme.

Wanting a capable administrator, Bhutto sought Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan to chair the commission, which Rahimuddin declined, in 1971. Instead, in January 1972, Bhutto chose a U.S.-trained nuclear engineer, Munir Khan, as chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). Bhutto realized he wanted an administrator who understood the scientific and economic needs of this technologically ambitious program. Since 1965, Munir Khan had developed an extremely close and trusted relationship with Bhutto, and even after his death, Benazir and Murtaza Bhutto were instructed by their father to keep in touch with Munir Khan. In the spring of 1976, Kahuta Research Facility, then known as Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL), as part of codename &quot;Project-706&quot;, was also established by Bhutto and brought under nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan and the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Lieutenant-General Zahid Ali Akbar.

Because Pakistan, under Bhutto, was not a signatory or party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique (CEA), and British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) had immediately cancelled fuel reprocessing plant projects with PAEC. According to Causar Nyäzie, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission officials had misled Bhutto, and he embarked on a long journey to try to obtain a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant from France. It was on the advice of A. Q. Khan that no fuel existed to reprocess and urged Bhutto to follow his pursuit of uranium enrichment. Bhutto tried to show he was still interested in that expensive route and was relieved when Kissinger persuaded the French to cancel the deal. Bhutto had trusted Munir Ahmad Khan&#x27;s plans to develop the programme ingeniously, and the mainstream goal of showing such interest in the French reprocessing plant was to give time to PAEC scientists to gain expertise in building its own reprocessing plants. By the time France&#x27;s CEA cancelled the project, the PAEC had acquired 95% of the detailed plans of the plant and materials.

Munir Ahmad Khan and Ishfaq Ahmad believed that, since PAEC had acquired most of the detailed plans, work, and materials, the PAEC, based on that 95% work, could build the plutonium reprocessing reactors on its own. Pakistan should stick to its original plan, the plutonium route. Bhutto did not disagree but saw an advantage in establishing another parallel programme, the uranium enrichment programme under Abdul Qadeer Khan. Both Munir Khan and Ahmed had shown their concern over Abdul Qadeer Khan&#x27;s suspected activities, but Bhutto backed Khan when Bhutto maintained that: &quot;No less than any other nation did what Abdul Qadeer Khan (is) doing; the Soviets and Chinese; the British and the French; the Indians and the Israelis; stole the nuclear weapons designs previously in the past and no one questioned them but rather tend to be quiet. We are not stealing what they (illegally) stole in the past (as referring the nuclear weapon designs) but we&#x27;re taking a small machine which is not useful for making the atomic bomb but for a fuel&quot;. International pressure was difficult to counter at that time, and Bhutto, with the help of Munir Ahmad Khan and Aziz Ahmed, tackled the intense heated criticism and diplomatic war with the United States at numerous fronts—while the progress on nuclear weapons remained highly classified. During this pressure, Aziz Ahmed played a significant role by convincing the consortium industries to sell and export sensitive electronic components before the United States could approach them and try to prevent the consortium industries from exporting such equipment and components. Bhutto slowly reversed and thwarted the United States&#x27; any attempt to infiltrate the programme as he had expelled many of the American diplomatic officials in the country, under &quot;Operation Sun Rise&quot;, authorised by Bhutto under &quot;ISI&quot;. On the other hand, Bhutto intensified his staunch support and blindly backed Abdul Qadeer Khan to quietly bring the Urenco&#x27;s weapon-grade technology to Pakistan, keeping the Kahuta Laboratories hidden from the outside world. Regional rivals such as India and the Soviet Union had no basic intelligence on Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear energy project during the 1970s, and Bhutto&#x27;s intensified clandestine efforts seemed to pay off in 1978 when the programme was fully matured.

In a thesis presented in &quot;The Myth of Independence&quot;, Bhutto argued that nuclear weapons would enable India to deploy its Air Force warplanes with small battlefield nuclear devices against the Pakistan Army cantonments, armoured and infantry columns, PAF bases, and nuclear and military industrial facilities. The Indian Air Force would not face adverse reactions from the world community as long as civilian casualties could be minimized. This strategy aimed to lead India to defeat Pakistan, compel its armed forces into a humiliating surrender, and annex the Northern Areas of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. Subsequently, India would partition Pakistan into smaller states based on ethnic divisions, marking the resolution of the &quot;Pakistan problem&quot; once and for all.

By the time Bhutto was ousted, this crash programme had fully matured in terms of technical development and scientific efforts. By 1977, PAEC and KRL had constructed their uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing plants, and the selection for test sites at Chagai Hills was completed by the PAEC. Feasibility reports on their works were submitted by both organizations. In 1977, the PAEC&#x27;s Theoretical Physics Group had completed the design of the first fission weapon, and KRL scientists succeeded in electromagnetic isotope separation of Uranium fissile isotopes. Despite this, little progress had been made in the development of weapons, and Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenal was actually created during General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s military regime, overseen by several Naval admirals, Army and Air Force generals, including Ghulam Ishaq Khan. In 1983, Bhutto&#x27;s decision was later vindicated when PAEC conducted a cold test near Kirana Hills, evidently made from non-fissioned plutonium. Recent press speculation suggests that Dr. Khan&#x27;s uranium enrichment designs were exchanged with the Chinese for uranium hexafluoride (UF6) and some highly enriched weapons-grade uranium. Later, this weapons-grade uranium was offered back to the Chinese as the Pakistanis used their own materials. Overall, Bhutto knew that Pakistan had become a nuclear weapon state in 1978 when his friend Munir Ahmad Khan visited him in his jail cell. There, Munir Ahmad Khan informed Bhutto that the process of weapon designing was finished, and a milestone in the complex and difficult enrichment of weapon-grade fuel had been achieved by the PAEC and Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan of ERL. Bhutto called for an immediate nuclear test to be conducted, but no response was issued by General Zia or any member of his government.

== Prime Minister of Pakistan ==

Bhutto was sworn in as the prime minister of the country on 14 August 1973, after securing 108 votes in a house of 146 members. Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry was elected as the president under the new constitution. During his five years of government, the Bhutto administration implemented extensive reforms at every level of governance. Capital and Western reforms initiated and built in 1947 were transformed and replaced with a socialist system throughout the 1970s. Bhutto&#x27;s policies were perceived as people-friendly but failed to yield long-lasting effects, and civil disorder against Bhutto began to escalate in 1977.

=== Constitutional reforms ===

Bhutto is considered the main architect of the 1973 constitution as part of his vision to lead Pakistan toward parliamentary democracy. One of the major achievements in Bhutto&#x27;s life was the drafting of Pakistan&#x27;s first-ever consensus constitution for the country. Bhutto supervised the promulgation of the 1973 constitution, triggering an unstoppable constitutional revolution through his politics wedded to the emancipation of the downtrodden masses, giving them a voice in Parliament and introducing radical changes in the economic sphere for their benefit.

During his time in office, the government carried out seven major amendments to the 1973 Constitution. The First Amendment led to Pakistan&#x27;s recognition of and diplomatic ties with Bangladesh. The Second Amendment in the constitution declared the Ahmadis as non-Muslims and defined the term non-Muslim. The rights of the detained were limited under the Third Amendment, while the powers and jurisdiction of the courts for providing relief to political opponents were curtailed under the Fourth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment, passed on 15 September 1976, focused on curtailing the power and jurisdiction of the Judiciary. This amendment was highly criticised by lawyers and political leaders. The main provision of the Sixth Amendment extended the term of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and the High Courts beyond the age of retirement. This amendment was made in the Constitution to favour the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who was supposed to be a friend of Bhutto.

=== Industrial reforms ===
The Bhutto government implemented a series of reforms in the industrial sector, focusing on nationalization and improving workers&#x27; rights. The initial phase, in 1972, involved the nationalization of basic industries such as steel, chemical, and cement. A significant move occurred on 1 January 1974, when Bhutto nationalized all banks. The final step in this sequence was the nationalization of all flour, rice, and cotton mills across the country. However, this nationalization process didn&#x27;t meet Bhutto&#x27;s expectations and faced challenges. Many nationalized units were small businesses that didn&#x27;t qualify as industrial units, leading to adverse consequences for numerous small businessmen and traders who were either ruined, displaced, or left unemployed. In hindsight, nationalization resulted in significant losses to both the national treasury and the people of Pakistan.

The Bhutto government established an extensive network of both rural and urban schools, including approximately 6,500 elementary schools, 900 middle schools, 407 high schools, 51 intermediate colleges, and 21 junior colleges. Departing from the Western education system, Bhutto returned most literature to the Western world and encouraged local academicians to publish books in their respective fields. Although these local books were made more affordable to the public, these reforms stirred controversy. Bhutto&#x27;s government mandated the inclusion of Islamic and Pakistan studies in school curricula. Book banks were introduced in most institutions, and over 400,000 copies of textbooks were supplied to students.

Bhutto is credited with establishing the world-class Quaid-e-Azam University and Allama Iqbal Open University in Islamabad in 1974, along with founding Gomal University in Dera Ismail Khan in 1973. During his tenure as Foreign Minister, he collaborated with Abdus Salam in 1967 to set up the Institute of Theoretical Physics. As Prime Minister, Bhutto made groundbreaking efforts to enhance the education system, founding the Allama Iqbal Medical College in 1975. In 1974, with Abdus Salam&#x27;s assistance, Bhutto authorized the International Nathiagali Summer College on Contemporary Physics (INSC) at Nathiagali. To this day, the INSC conference continues to be held in Pakistan, attracting thousands of scientists worldwide to interact with Pakistan&#x27;s academic community. In 1976, Bhutto established the Engineering Council, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Pakistan Academy of Letters, and Cadet College Razmak in North Waziristan. Additionally, he inaugurated four new universities in Multan, Bahawalpur, and Khairpur. The People&#x27;s Open University, another innovative venture, commenced operations in Islamabad. The government&#x27;s Education Policy included fee remission and the provision of numerous scholarships for higher education to the children of low-paid employees.

After the 1977 election, plans were in place to add seven thousand new hostel seats to the existing accommodation. In 1975, Bhutto acknowledged the challenges and shortcomings faced by college students in many existing hostels. Consequently, he directed the provision of fans, water coolers, and pay telephones in each hostel as quickly as physically possible.

=== Land, flood and agriculture reforms ===
During his tenure as prime minister, several land reforms were introduced. The significant land reforms included the reduction of land ceilings and the introduction of tenancy security for tenant farmers. The land ceiling was fixed at of irrigated land and of non-irrigated land. Another step that Bhutto took was to democratise Pakistan&#x27;s Civil Service. In Balochistan, the pernicious practice of Shishak and Sardari System was abolished. In 1976, the Bhutto government established the Federal Flood Commission (FFC), tasked with preparing national flood protection plans, flood forecasting, and research to harness floodwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn News Papers, 2010/08/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto later went on to upgrade a number of dams and barrages built in Sindh Province.

Bhutto strongly advocated empowering small farmers, asserting that a weak and demoralized farming community would jeopardize Pakistan&#x27;s agricultural strength. He believed that farmers needed to feel psychologically secure for the country to achieve self-sufficiency in food. Consequently, the Bhutto government launched programmes to lead the country towards self-sufficiency in rice hulling, sugar milling, and wheat husking industries. Bhutto&#x27;s government increased control over rice hulling, sugar mills, and wheat husking factories, initially believing that public sector involvement would diminish the influence of multinational corporations and prevent monopolies. The government initiated schemes to address waterlogging and salinity issues. Tax exceptions were introduced for small landowners to promote agricultural growth. While his nationalization of Sindh-based industries benefited the poor, it caused discontent among influential feudal lords.

=== Economic policy ===
Bhutto implemented socialist economics while working to prevent any further division of the country. Major heavy mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering industries were immediately nationalised by Bhutto, and all of the industries came under direct control of government. Industries, such as Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KSEC), were under complete government control with no private influence in KESC decision. Bhutto abandoned Ayub Khan&#x27;s state capitalism policies and introduced socialist policies in a move to reduce income inequality. Bhutto also established the Port Qasim, Pakistan Steel Mills, the Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC), and several cement factories. However, the growth rate of the economy relative to that of the 1960s when East Pakistan was still part of Pakistan and large generous aid from the United States declined after the global oil crises in 1973, which also had a negative impact on the economy. Despite the initiatives undertaken by Bhutto&#x27;s government to boost the country&#x27;s economy, the economical growth remained at an equilibrium level. But Bhutto&#x27;s policy largely benefited the poor and working class when the level of absolute poverty was sharply reduced, with the percentage of the population estimated to be living in absolute poverty falling from 46.5% by the end of 1979–80, under General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s military rule, to 30.8%. The land reform programme provided increased economic support to landless tenants, and development spending was substantially increased, particularly on health and education, in both rural and urban areas, and provided &quot;material support&quot; to rural wage workers, landless peasants, and urban wage workers.

Bhutto&#x27;s nationalisation policies aimed to empower workers, giving them control over the means of production and protecting small businesses. However, economic historians argued that the nationalisation program initially affected small industries and had devastating effects on Pakistan&#x27;s economy, diminishing Bhutto&#x27;s credibility. Conservative critics believed the nationalisation policies damaged investor confidence, and government corruption in nationalised industries grew, although no serious corruption cases were ever proven against Bhutto by the military junta. In 1974, Bhutto maintained that foreign companies and industries in Pakistan were exempt from nationalisation policies, and his government would welcome foreign investment to establish factories. Commenting on his policies in 1973, Bhutto told a group of investors from the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) that &quot;activity of the public sector or state sector prevents the concentration of economic power in a few hands and protects small and medium entrepreneurs from the clutches of giant enterprises and vested interests.&quot;

Bhutto&#x27;s departure from certain socialist policies greatly displeased his democratic socialist alliance and many in the Pakistan Peoples Party. Notably, Malik Meraj Khalid and other colleagues, resigned from Bhutto and left for the Soviet Union. Ongoing disagreements eventually led to the collapse of the government&#x27;s socialist alliance, which later united with the secular Independence Movement led by Asghar Khan.

As part of his investment policies, Bhutto established the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) in July 1973, with an initial government investment of 100 million PRs. Initially aimed at financing public sector industrial enterprises, its charter was later modified to provide finance to the private sector as well. The NDFC is currently the largest development finance institution in Pakistan, engaging in diversified activities in industrial financing and investment banking. Forty-two projects financed by NDFC have contributed Rs. 10,761 million to Pakistan&#x27;s GDP, generating Rs. 690 million in after-tax profits and creating 40,465 jobs. By the mid-1990s, NDFC had a pool of resources amounting to US$878 million. The Bhutto government increased the level of investment, both private and public, in the economy from less than Rs. 7,000 million in 1971–72 to more than Rs. 17,000 million in 1974–75.

=== Banking and Export expansion ===
Banking reforms were introduced to provide more opportunities to small farmers and businesses, such as mandating that 70% of institutional lending should be for small landholders of 12.5 acres or less—a revolutionary idea at a time when banks primarily served privileged classes. The number of bank branches increased by 75% from December 1971 to November 1976, rising from 3,295 to 5,727. This move by Bhutto was one of the most radical, expanding bank infrastructure to cover all towns and villages with a population of 5,000, following the nationalisation of banks.

By the end of Bhutto&#x27;s government, the concentration of wealth had declined compared to the height of the Ayub Khan era when 22 families owned 66% of industrial capital and controlled banking and 97% of insurance.

Measures taken in the first few months of 1972 set a new framework for the revival of the economy. The diversion of trade from East Pakistan to international markets was completed within a short period. By 1974, exports exceeded one billion dollars, showing a 60% increase over the combined exports of East and West Pakistan before separation. This growth was achieved and benefited from during the major 1973 oil crisis and in the middle of a global recession. The national income of Pakistan increased by 15%, and industrial production rose by as much as 20% in four years.

=== Balochistan ===

==== Military operation ====
Following the secession of East Pakistan, calls for the independence of Balochistan by Baloch nationalists grew immensely. Surveying the political instability, Bhutto&#x27;s central government sacked two provincial governments within six months, arrested the two chief ministers, two governors, and forty-four MNAs and MPAs, obtained an order from the Supreme Court banning the National People&#x27;s Party on the recommendation of Akbar Bugti, and charged everyone with high treason to be tried by a specially constituted Hyderabad tribunal of hand-picked judges.

In January 1973, Bhutto ordered the Pakistan Armed Forces to suppress a rising insurgency in the province of Balochistan. He dismissed the governments in Balochistan and the North-West Frontier Province once more. Following the alleged discovery of Iraqi arms in Islamabad in February 1973, Bhutto dissolved the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan. The operation, under General Tikka Khan, soon took shape in a five-year conflict with the Baloch separatists. The sporadic fighting between the insurgency and the army started in 1973, with the largest confrontation taking place in September 1974. Later on, Pakistan Navy, under Vice-Admiral Patrick Julius Simpson, also jumped into the conflict as it had applied naval blockades to Balochistan&#x27;s port. The Navy began its separate operations to seize the shipments sent to aid Baloch separatists. Pakistan Air Force also launched air operations, and with the support of navy and army, the air force had pounded the mountainous hidden havens of the Separatists. The Iranian military, also fearing a spread of the greater Baloch resistance in Iran, aided the Pakistani military as well. Among Iran&#x27;s contributions were 30 Huey cobra attack helicopters and $200 million in aid.

==== Iraqi intervention ====

Iraq under Sunni President Saddam Hussein sent Iraqi-made weapons to Pakistan&#x27;s warm water ports. Pakistan&#x27;s navy mounted an effective blockade. Saddam&#x27;s government provided support for Baluchi separatists in Pakistan, hoping their conflict would spread to rival Iran. In 1973, Iraq provided the Baluchis with conventional arms, and it opened an office for the Baluchistan Liberation Front (BLF) in Baghdad. This operation was supposed to be covert, but in 1973, the operation was exposed by M.I. when senior separatist leader Akbar Bugti defected to Bhutto, revealing a series of arms stored in the Iraqi Embassy. On the midnight of 9 February 1973, Bhutto launched an operation to seize control of the Iraqi Embassy, and preparation for the siege was hastily prepared. The operation was highly risky, and a wrong step could have started a war between the two countries. The operation was carefully analyzed and at 00:00 hrs (12:00 am), the SSG Division accompanied by Army Rangers stormed the Embassy. Military Police arrested the Iraqi Ambassador, the military attaché, and Iraq&#x27;s diplomatic staff. Following the incident, authorities discovered 300 Soviet sub-machine guns with 50,000 rounds of ammunition and a large amount of money that was to be distributed amongst Baluchi separatist groups. Bhutto was angered and frustrated. Without demanding an explanation, he ordered the Military Police to immediately expel the Iraqi Ambassador and his staff as persona non grata on the first available flight.

The government announced the Iraqi plan to further dismember the country, and Bhutto&#x27;s successful diplomatic offensive against Iraq isolated Saddam internationally with global condemnation. This incident caused Pakistan to support Iran during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s.

==== Aftermath ====

In order to avoid a replay of the East-Pakistan war, Bhutto launched economic and political reforms in the midst of the conflict. The Bhutto government abolished the feudal system, despite opposition from feudal lords who continued to appropriate a generous share of government developmental funds. Gradually, tribesmen started coming out of the Sardars&#x27; quarantine. Modern amenities, such as medical aid, automobiles for passenger transport, and schooling for children, became available in the interior of Baluchistan for the first time since 1947. The Bhutto government also constructed 564 miles of new roads, including the key link between Sibi and Maiwand, creating new trade and commerce centres.

=== Passport reforms ===
The Bhutto government granted the right of a passport to every citizen of Pakistan, facilitating millions of skilled and non-skilled Pakistanis to seek employment in Gulf countries through a series of bilateral agreements. From Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, alone, 35,000 workers were given the opportunity to work in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Bhutto utilized the Pakistani community of London to lobby and influence European governments to improve the rights of expatriate Pakistani communities in Europe. The remittances from overseas Pakistanis, now totaling around $US25 billion per annum, constitute a dependable source of foreign exchange for Pakistan.

=== Labour policy and social security ===
Bhutto&#x27;s government implemented comprehensive labour reforms, introducing conditions on worker dismissals and establishing Labour Courts for swift grievance redressal. A scheme for workers&#x27; participation in management was introduced, ensuring 20% participation at the factory level. The government abolished workers&#x27; contribution to the Social Security Fund, shifting the burden to employers. Compensation rates under the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Act were increased.

In 1972, the government initially provided old age benefits through group insurance, enhanced compensation rates, and gratuity. To address immediate needs, a pension scheme was introduced, offering Rs. 75 per month after retirement at 55 for men and 50 for women with 15 years of insurable employment. This applied to establishments employing ten or more workers with monthly wages up to Rs. 1,000, including benefits for skilled workers invalid after five years of insurable employment.

Contrary to the Western model, Bhutto&#x27;s government aimed to relieve workers of the financial burden, funding the scheme through a 5% contribution from employers based on the wage bill.

=== Foreign policy ===

After assuming power, Bhutto aimed to diversify Pakistan&#x27;s relations, leading to its exit from CENTO and SEATO. He strengthened Arab relations and developed Sino-Pak relations. Bhutto believed in an independent Foreign Policy, distinct from Western influence, particularly the United States&#x27; sphere of influence. With Bhutto as Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, Pakistan and Iran formed a special relationship, as Iran provided military assistance. The Sino-Pak relations were immensely improved, and Pakistan, under Bhutto, had built a strategic relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, when PRC was isolated. In 1974, Bhutto hosted the second Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 1974 where he delegated and invited leaders from the Muslim world to Lahore, Punjab Province of Pakistan. Bhutto was a strong advocate of Afro-Asian Solidarity and had cemented ties with Afro-Asian and Islamic countries and by 1976 had emerged as the Leader of the Third World.

Bhutto pursued a peace agreement, the Simla Agreement, with Indira Gandhi, the Premier of India. He successfully brought back 93,000 P.O.Ws to Pakistan and secured held by India without compromising on the Kashmir stance or recognizing Bangladesh, which were key Indian demands. Negotiating with a power that had dismembered the country was a significant challenge for Bhutto, but he smoothly convinced India to return the territory and the POWs to Pakistan. Before the conference, Bhutto and his colleagues thoroughly prepared, considering that the Arabs had not succeeded in regaining territory lost in the 1967 war with Israel. Bhutto understood that capturing land does not attract the same international attention as the plight of prisoners. According to Benazir Bhutto, Bhutto demanded control of the territory in the first stage of the Agreement, surprising and shocking the Indian delegation. From Bhutto&#x27;s perspective, the POW problem was more of a humanitarian problem that could be addressed at any time, but the territorial problem could become integrated into India over time. Indian Premier Gandhi was stunned and astonished at Bhutto&#x27;s demand but eventually agreed to give the territory back to Bhutto in the first stage of the agreement after Bhutto negotiated with economic packages. Bhutto&#x27;s knowledge and intellectualism impressed Gandhi personally, making this agreement, with Pakistan paying a small price, one of Bhutto&#x27;s most significant diplomatic successes.

Bhutto&#x27;s extensive knowledge, intelligence, and keen awareness of post-World War II and the nuclear history enabled him to shape foreign policy, resulting in unparalleled unity in Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy history. Elements of his policy were continued by successive governments, playing a vital role in world politics. In 1974, Bhutto and his Foreign Minister Aziz Ahmed brought a U.N. resolution, recommending the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. They aggressively criticized the Indian nuclear program. While Abdul Qadeer Khan was tasked with acquiring gas-centrifuge technology through atomic proliferation, the resolution&#x27;s goal was achieved when Bhutto put India on the defensive and promoted Pakistan as a non-proliferationist.

==== East Asia ====
Since the 1960s, Bhutto had been anti-SEATO and preferred a non-aligned policy. Soon after assuming office, Bhutto took a lengthy foreign trip to Southeast Asia, seeking closer relations with Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Burma, and North Korea. His policy largely followed tight relations with China, normalized relationships with the Soviet Union, built an Islamic bloc, and advocated the creation of a new economic alliance benefiting third and second world countries.

All of these initiatives and implications had disastrous effects on Japan, prompting Japan to oppose Bhutto, although Bhutto was a great admirer of Japan, even though Japan was not a constituent part of Bhutto&#x27;s foreign policy. In the 1970s, Japan made several attempts to get close to Bhutto, sending its military officials, scientists, and parliamentary delegations to Pakistan. Hence Japan went far by condemning India for carrying out a nuclear test, &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;, in 1974, and publicly supported Pakistan&#x27;s non-nuclear weapon policy and pledged to build several new nuclear power plants. In 1970, Bhutto advised Japan not to be a party to NPT, but Japan signed it but later regretted not being properly progressed.

In Bhutto&#x27;s view, Japan had been under the United States&#x27; influence, and a much bigger role of Japan in Asia would only benefit American interests in the region. By the 1970s, Japan completely lost its momentum in Pakistan as Pakistan followed a strict independent policy. Bhutto envisioned Pakistan&#x27;s new policy as benefiting economic relations rather than the military alliance, which also affected Japan&#x27;s impact on Pakistan. However, much of the foreign policy efforts were reverted by General Zia-ul-Haq, and ties were finally restored after Bhutto&#x27;s execution.

==== Arab world and Israel ====
Bhutto sought to improve Pakistan&#x27;s ties with the Arab world and sided with the Arab world during the Arab-Israeli conflict. Colonel Gaddafi of former Socialist Libya considered Bhutto one of his greatest inspirations and was said to be very fond of Bhutto&#x27;s intellectualism. In 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, Pakistan&#x27;s relations with the Arab world represented a watershed. In both Pakistan and the Arab world, Pakistan&#x27;s swift, unconditional, and forthright offer of assistance to the Arab states was deeply appreciated.
In 1974, pressured by other Muslim nations, Pakistan eventually recognized Bangladesh as Mujib stated he would only go to the OIC conference in Lahore if Pakistan recognized Bangladesh. Pakistan established full diplomatic relations with Bangladesh on 18 January 1976, and relations improved in the following decades. Bhutto aided the Syrian and Egyptian Air Force by sending the Pakistan Air Force and Navy&#x27;s top fighter pilots, where they flew combat missions against Israel. However, Iraq did not benefit from Bhutto&#x27;s policies.

In early 1977, Bhutto decided to use the ISI to provide credible intelligence on the Iraqi nuclear program that Pakistan and the &quot;ISI&quot; had secretly gained. The government passed intel that identified the Iraqi nuclear program and the Osirak Nuclear Reactor at Osirak to Israel&#x27;s &quot;Mossad&quot;. Helping Israel infiltrate the Iraqi nuclear program was also continued by General Zia-ul-Haq as their policy to teach Iraq and Saddam Hussein a lesson for supporting the Baloch liberation fronts and movements.

==== United States and Soviet Union ====

In 1974, India carried out a nuclear test, codenamed &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;, near Pakistan&#x27;s eastern border. Bhutto unsuccessfully lobbied for the United States to impose economic sanctions on India. However, at the request of Bhutto, Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States convened a meeting with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Kissinger told Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to Washington that the test is &quot;a fait accompli and that Pakistan would have to learn to live with it&quot;, although he was aware this was &quot;a little rough&quot; on the Pakistanis. In 1976, the ties were further severed with Bhutto as Bhutto had continued to administer the research on weapons, and in 1976, in a meeting with Bhutto and Kissinger, Kissinger had told Bhutto, &quot;that if you [Bhutto] do not cancel, modify, or postpone the Reprocessing Plant Agreement, we will make a horrible example of you&quot;. The meeting was ended by Bhutto as he had replied: For my country&#x27;s sake, for the sake of the people of Pakistan, I did not succumb to that blackmailing and threats.

After this meeting, Bhutto intensified Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy towards a more neutral stance, aligning with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, and sought to develop relations with both the Soviet Union and the United States. Bhutto was keenly aware of Great Britain&#x27;s policy of &quot;divide and rule&quot; and American policy of &quot;unite and rule.&quot; In 1974, Bhutto, as Prime Minister, visited the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Bhutto deliberately worked to improve relations with the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc. The foundation stone for Pakistan Steel Mills was laid on 30 December 1973 by Bhutto. The Soviet Union sent advisors and experts to supervise the construction of the mega-project.

Though Richard Nixon maintained amicable relations with Bhutto, Pakistan&#x27;s ties with the United States soured during Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency as the US opposed Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program. Carter intensified the embargo on Pakistan and exerted pressure through the United States Ambassador to Pakistan, Brigadier-General Henry Byroade. Bhutto&#x27;s socialist orientation irked the United States, concerned about losing Pakistan as an ally in the Cold War. When Carter was elected in 1976, he declared in his inaugural speech his intent to pursue a nuclear weapons ban. With Carter&#x27;s election, Bhutto lost the connections to the United States administration that he had enjoyed during Nixon&#x27;s term.

Despite Carter imposing an embargo on Pakistan, Bhutto persisted in acquiring materials for Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb project, ultimately contributing to the breakdown of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.

==== Afghanistan and Central Asia ====

In 1972, Bhutto initially attempted to forge friendly ties with Afghanistan, but these efforts were rebuffed in 1973. By 1974, Afghanistan covertly engaged in Pakistan&#x27;s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, causing increasing concern for Bhutto&#x27;s government. Afghan President Dawood Khan&#x27;s controversial Pashtunisation policies led to gruesome violence and civil disturbances in Pakistan. The ISI highlighted President Daud&#x27;s support for anti-Pakistan militants, including backing Baloch separatists in the conflict. Consequently, Bhutto&#x27;s government opted to retaliate, launching a covert counter-operation in 1974 under Major-General Naseerullah Babar, then Director-General of the M.I. Directorate-General for Western Fronts (DGWI). General Babar deemed it an excellent idea, with a significant impact on Afghanistan. The operation aimed to arm Islamic fundamentalists and instigate attacks across Afghanistan. In 1974, Bhutto authorised a covert operation in Kabul, where the Pakistan Air Force, AI, and the &quot;ISI&quot; successfully extradited Burhanuddin Rabbani, Jan Mohammad Khan, Gulbadin Hekmatyar, and Ahmad Shah Massoud to Peshawar. Fearful of Rabbani&#x27;s potential assassination, this move took place amid heightened tensions. By the end of 1974, Bhutto had given final authorization for a covert operation to train Afghan mujaheddin, ultimately proving successful.

By 1976, Daud grew concerned about his country&#x27;s overdependence on the Soviet Union and the rising insurgency. Bhutto&#x27;s three-day state visit to Afghanistan in June 1976 was followed by Daud Khan&#x27;s five-day visit to Pakistan in August 1976. An agreement on the resumption of air communications between Afghanistan and Pakistan was reached on 2 March 1977, signaling improved relations. Bhutto and Daud exchanged official visits to pressure Afghanistan to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border. However, these developments were interrupted by Bhutto&#x27;s removal and Daud Khan&#x27;s overthrow in a military coup shortly after. Western experts considered Bhutto&#x27;s policy astute in addressing the border question, increasing pressure on Afghanistan and likely contributing to the Afghan government&#x27;s move towards accommodation. Deputy Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Samad Ghaus also admitted that, before the compromise, Afghanistan had been heavily involved inside Pakistan.

== Downfall and overthrow ==

=== Popular unrest ===

Bhutto faced mounting criticism and growing unpopularity during his term. Initially targeting opposition leader Abdul Wali Khan and his National Awami Party (NAP), a democratic socialist party, the socialist and communist masses under Bhutto&#x27;s leadership began to disintegrate. Despite ideological similarities, clashes between them became increasingly farcical. The federal government ousted the NAP provincial government in Balochistan for alleged secessionist activities, leading to the ban on the NAP. Subsequently, much of the NAP top leadership was arrested, following the killing of Bhutto&#x27;s confidant Hayat Khan Sherpao in a Peshawar bomb blast. Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman also died of a cardiac arrest while in office. Between 1974 and 1976, many of Bhutto&#x27;s original members left due to political differences or natural causes. In 1974, Bhutto&#x27;s trusted Science Advisor Abdus Salam left Pakistan when Parliament declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Salam&#x27;s departure slowed down nuclear weapons research as Dr. Mubashir Hassan, now Bhutto&#x27;s appointed Science Advisor, focused more on politics than scientific research. Many civil bureaucrats and military officers loyal to Bhutto were replaced by new faces, leaving Bhutto with new advisers and collaborators.

Dissidence grew within the PPP, and the murder of dissident leader Ahmed Raza Kasuri&#x27;s father triggered public outrage and intra-party hostility. Bhutto faced accusations of masterminding the crime. Prominent PPP leaders, including Ghulam Mustafa Khar, former Governor of Punjab, openly condemned Bhutto, urging protests against his regime. The political crisis in the North-West Frontier Province and Balochistan escalated, with civil liberties suspended. An estimated 100,000 deployed troops faced accusations of human rights abuses and large-scale civilian casualties.

On 8 January 1977, the opposition coalesced into the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA), a nine-party coalition against Bhutto&#x27;s government. Despite Bhutto calling for fresh elections, the PNA failed to secure a clear majority and disputed the results, accusing their opponents of rigging the election. Claiming that 40 seats in the national assembly were rigged, the dissidents boycotted the provincial elections, leading to low voter turnout. The PNA declared the newly elected Bhutto government illegitimate, with hard-line Islamist leaders like Maulana Maududi calling for Bhutto&#x27;s overthrow. Bhutto&#x27;s Science Advisor, Mubashir Hassan, feared a possible coup and unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the PNA. A crackdown on the conservative Pakistan Muslim League followed, initiated by Bhutto&#x27;s government. President of the People&#x27;s National Party and former Leader of the Opposition, Khan Vali Khan, viewed Bhutto&#x27;s actions as his last stand against the PNA, leaving Bhutto and his colleagues isolated. In a public seminar, Vali Khan quoted, &quot;There is one possible grave for two people ... let us see who gets in first.&quot; The Federal Security Force allegedly arrested or extrajudicially killed members of the Muslim League, leading to protest and civil unrest in Lahore, resulting in the People&#x27;s Party losing administrative control over the city.

=== Military coup ===
On 3 July 1977, General Khalid Mahmud Arif secretly met with Bhutto, revealing that a coup was being planned in the General Combatant Headquarters (GHQ). General Arif urged Bhutto to &quot;rush the negotiation with the PNA before it&#x27;s too late.&quot; Growing political and civil disorder led Bhutto to engage in talks with PNA leaders, resulting in an agreement to dissolve the assemblies and hold fresh elections under a government of national unity. However, on 5 July 1977, Bhutto and his cabinet members were arrested by troops under the command of General Zia. Despite Bhutto reaching an agreement with the opposition, the coup took place on the pretext of unrest.

Bhutto had intelligence within the Army, and officers like Major-General Tajamül Hussain Malik remained loyal to him until the end. Nevertheless, General Zia-ul-Haq initiated a training program with officers from the Special Air Service (SAS). Many of Bhutto&#x27;s loyal officers were ordered to attend the first course. Senior officers&#x27; classes were delayed until midnight, and none were allowed to leave until late in the evening before the coup, during which arrangements were made.

General Zia declared martial law, suspended the constitution, dissolved all assemblies, and promised elections within ninety days. Zia ordered the arrest of senior PPP and PNA leaders but assured elections in October. Bhutto was released on 29 July and received a warm welcome from supporters in Larkana. He toured Pakistan, delivering speeches to large crowds and planning his political comeback. Bhutto was arrested again on 3 September and released on bail on 13 September. Fearing another arrest, he appointed his wife, Nusrat, as president of the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party. Bhutto was imprisoned on 16 September, and many PPP leaders, including Mubashir Hassan, were arrested and disqualified from contesting elections. Observers noted that when Bhutto was removed from power in July 1977, thousands of Pakistanis cheered and celebrated.

== Trial and execution ==
On 5 July 1977, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq led a military coup, removing Bhutto from power and detaining him for a month. Zia promised new elections within 90 days but continuously postponed them, asserting that Bhutto&#x27;s party wouldn&#x27;t return to power if he participated.

Upon release, Bhutto toured the country, addressing adulatory crowds of PPP supporters. Banned from train travel due to delays caused by these gatherings, Bhutto&#x27;s last visit to Multan marked a turning point. Despite administration efforts to block the gathering, the crowd&#x27;s size led to disorder, providing a pretext for Bhutto&#x27;s arrest, claiming it was necessary for his safety.

On 3 September, Bhutto was arrested again, charged with authorizing the murder of a political opponent in March 1974. The charges were deemed &quot;questionable&quot; by some scholars, including Vali Nasr. A politician, Ahmed Raza Kasuri, claimed he was the target of the attack orchestrated by Bhutto. Bhutto&#x27;s wife, Nusrat Bhutto, assembled a defense team, securing his release after ten days due to contradictory evidence. However, Bhutto was arrested again under martial law, leading to the cancellation of upcoming elections.

Arraigned before the Lahore High Court, Bhutto was denied a lower court appeal level. The trial, lasting five months, began on 24 October 1977, with key witness testimony from Masood Mahmood, director general of the Federal Security Force. Irregularities, alleged torture, and inconsistent confessions marred the trial. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark observed numerous irregularities and lack of corroborating evidence. When Bhutto began testifying on 25 January 1978, Chief Justice Maulvi Mushtaq, presiding over the trial, closed the courtroom to observers. Bhutto, alleging bias, demanded a retrial, but the court refused.

=== Death sentence and appeal ===
On 18 March 1978, Bhutto was pronounced guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. Bhutto&#x27;s former Legal Minister, Abdul Hafiz Pirzada petitioned the Supreme Court for the release of Bhutto&#x27;s Science Adviser, Mubashir Hassan, and to review Bhutto&#x27;s death sentence based on the split decision. The Supreme Court denied Hassan&#x27;s release because he was held by Military Police, but the court agreed to hear the arguments. After 12 days of proceedings, the Supreme Court concluded that the President of Pakistan can change a death sentence into life imprisonment. Pirzada filed an application to then-Chief Martial Law Administrator. However, General Zia-ul-Haq did not act immediately and claimed that the application had gone missing.

Devastated, Pirzada relayed the news to Bhutto, disclosing General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s intentions. Consequently, Bhutto chose not to pursue an appeal. As he was transferred to a cell in Rawalpindi central jail, his family appealed on his behalf, leading to a Supreme Court hearing in May. Bhutto was granted one week to prepare, issuing a comprehensive rejoinder to the charges, although Zia impeded its publication. Chief Justice S. Anwarul Haq adjourned the court until the end of July 1978, purportedly because five of the nine appeal court judges were inclined to overturn the Lahore verdict, with one pro-Bhutto judge set to retire in July.

Chief Justice S. Anwarul Haq, despite his close ties to Zia, presided over the trial and even served as Acting President when Zia was abroad. Bhutto&#x27;s legal team successfully secured his right to conduct his own defense before the Supreme Court. On 18 December 1978, Bhutto appeared in public before a crowded courtroom in Rawalpindi. Having spent 9 months on death row, he had allegedly endured 25 days without fresh water at that point. Bhutto addressed the court for four days, delivering his statements without the aid of notes.

The appeal concluded on 23 December 1978. On 6 February 1979, the Supreme Court voted 4–3, delivering a guilty verdict. Bhutto&#x27;s defender, Ramsey Clark, noted that during the appeal, &quot;not one witness was re‐examined, nor did the court rectify&quot; what he called &quot;the glaring defects of the lower court&#x27;s proceedings.&quot; Clark also highlighted that two of the Supreme Court&#x27;s nine justices were absent from the decision, both showing signs of having been forced to not participate. One judge who had earlier remarked that he would not succumb to pressure retired in the fall of 1978 even though judicial propriety demanded that his leaving the Court be deferred until the conclusion of the case. The other judge was prevented from sitting in the Court from November because of an illness pronounced by a government‐appointed medical board. If they had been present and voted not guilty in a 5–4 decision, Bhutto would have gone free. The Bhutto family had seven days to appeal, and the court granted a stay of execution while studying the petition. Appeals for clemency arrived from many heads of state by 24 February 1979 when the next court hearing began, but Zia dismissed them as &quot;trade union activity&quot; among politicians.

On 24 March 1979, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, and Zia upheld the death sentence. Bhutto was hanged at Central Jail Rawalpindi on 4 April 1979, after enduring severe torture in jail, leading to vomiting and intense chest pain, and he was laid to rest at his family mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Baksh.

During his imprisonment, Bhutto&#x27;s children Murtaza and Benazir worked tirelessly to garner international support for their father&#x27;s release. Libya&#x27;s Colonel Gaddafi dispatched his Prime Minister Abdus Salam Jalloud on an urgent mission to Pakistan for talks with the military establishment to secure Bhutto&#x27;s release. In a press conference, Jalloud revealed that Gaddafi had proposed to exile General Zia to Libya, and the Presidential aircraft awaited Bhutto at the Islamabad International Airport. However, after a week at the airport, General Zia rejected Jalloud&#x27;s request and upheld the death sentence. Bhutto&#x27;s execution shocked much of the Muslim world. In his final speech before being hanged, Bhutto&#x27;s last words were: &quot;Oh Lord, help me for... I am innocent.&quot;

=== Re-opening of the Bhutto trial ===
On 2 April 2011, 32 years after Bhutto&#x27;s trial and execution, the PPP (the ruling party at that time) filed a petition at the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) to reopen Bhutto&#x27;s trial. Senior journalist Iftikhar Ahmad aired a series of televised interviews on &quot;Geo News&quot; with those who played significant and often controversial roles in Bhutto&#x27;s death. Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani&#x27;s cabinet organized a legal team to seek the reopening of the trial. President Asif Ali Zardari consented to the resulting presidential order under Article 186 of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court took up the petition on 13 April 2011. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry eventually presided over the three-judge bench (expanded with law experts from four provinces of Pakistan), while Minister of Law Babar Awan counseled Bhutto&#x27;s case.

Immediately, Babar Awan resigned from his position as Law Minister, opting to leave the Justice Ministry entirely to independently counsel Bhutto&#x27;s case. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry commended this move by the senior PPP leadership, labeling it as &quot;historic&quot; in his noting remarks. In a significant development, the Supreme Court transferred the decision on the legal status of Bhutto&#x27;s execution to a larger bench yet to be formed.

Following a series of hearings at the Supreme Court, the case was adjourned and eventually dismissed after the PPP sanctioned the suspension of Babar Awan on 2 May 2012.

On 6 March 2024, a nine-member SCP bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan, Qazi Faez Isa, in response to the presidential reference provided an opinion that Bhutto was not provided a fair trial as mentioned in Article 4 and 9 of the Constitution of Pakistan.

== Personal life ==
Bhutto was a Muslim. In 1943, he entered into his first marriage with his cousin Shireen Amir Begum, from whom he later separated. On 8 September 1951, Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto married Nusrat Ispahani, also known as Begum Nusrat Bhutto, of Iranian Kurdish origin in Karachi. Their first child, Benazir, was born in 1953, followed by Murtaza in 1954, Sanam in 1957, and Shahnawaz in 1958.

== Reception and legacy ==
Bhutto remains a complex and debated figure in Pakistan. While lauded for his nationalism, he faced criticism for suppressing political opponents. In 1971, when he assumed control, Pakistan was in disarray after a brutal civil war. Critics blamed his socialist policies for economic setbacks, but Bhutto argued he addressed inequality from previous regimes.

Controversially, some attribute Bhutto for the Bangladesh Liberation War. General Zia-ul-Haq released General Yahya Khan in 1977, who accused Bhutto of breaking Pakistan in 1971. Bhutto also faces criticism for human-rights abuses in Baluchistan.

Internationally, Bhutto is viewed positively as a secular internationalist. Despite domestic criticism, he remains Pakistan&#x27;s most popular leader. Bhutto successfully united parties for the 1973 constitution and pursued nuclear weapons, earning him the title of the father of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program.

While his legacy is contested, Bhutto is hailed for his accomplishments. Some, like former statesman Roedad Khan, commend his early achievements but note a decline later on. His family, active in politics, faced tragedy with the assassinations of Benazir Bhutto in 2007 and Murtaza Bhutto in 1996.

Despite criticisms, Bhutto remains a revered figure in Pakistan&#x27;s collective memory, symbolizing influence in public, scientific, and political spheres. His family continues its political legacy, with Bilawal Bhutto Zardari serving as the Foreign Minister of Pakistan from April 2022 to August 2023.

<doc id="401119" wikidata="Q1028881" url="?curid=401119" title="GeForce 3 series">
<text>The GeForce 3 series (NV20) is the third generation of Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce line of graphics processing units (GPUs). Introduced in February 2001, it advanced the GeForce architecture by adding programmable pixel and vertex shaders, multisample anti-aliasing and improved the overall efficiency of the rendering process.

The GeForce 3 was unveiled during the 2001 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo/Tokyo 2001 in Makuhari Messe and powered realtime demos of Pixar&#x27;s Junior Lamp and id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom 3&quot;. Apple would later announce launch rights for its new line of computers.

The GeForce 3 family comprises 3 consumer models: the GeForce 3, the GeForce 3 Ti200, and the GeForce 3 Ti500. A separate professional version, with a feature-set tailored for computer aided design, was sold as the Quadro DCC. A derivative of the GeForce 3, known as the NV2A, is used in the Microsoft Xbox game console.

==Architecture==
The GeForce 3 was introduced three months after Nvidia acquired the assets of 3dfx. It was marketed as the &quot;nFinite FX Engine&quot;, and was the first Microsoft Direct3D 8.0 compliant 3D-card. Its programmable shader architecture enabled applications to execute custom visual effects programs in Microsoft Shader language 1.1. It is believed that the fixed-function T&amp;L hardware from GeForce 2 was still included on the chip for use with Direct3D 7.0 applications, as the single vertex shader was not fast enough to emulate it yet. With respect to pure pixel and texel throughput, the GeForce 3 has four pixel pipelines which each can sample two textures per clock. This is the same configuration as GeForce 2, excluding the slower GeForce 2 MX line.

To take better advantage of available memory performance, the GeForce 3 has a memory subsystem dubbed &quot;Lightspeed Memory Architecture&quot; (LMA). This is composed of several mechanisms that reduce overdraw, conserve memory bandwidth by compressing the z-buffer (depth buffer) and better manage interaction with the DRAM.

Other architectural changes include EMBM support (first introduced by Matrox in 1999) and improvements to anti-aliasing functionality. Previous GeForce chips could perform only super-sampled anti-aliasing (SSAA), a demanding process that renders the image at a large size internally and then scales it down to the end output resolution. GeForce 3 adds multi-sampling anti-aliasing (MSAA) and Quincunx anti-aliasing methods, both of which perform significantly better than super-sampling anti-aliasing at the expense of quality. With multi-sampling, the render output units super-sample only the Z-buffers and stencil buffers, and using that information get greater geometry detail needed to determine if a pixel covers more than one polygonal object. This saves the pixel/fragment shader from having to render multiple fragments for pixels where the same object covers all of the same sub-pixels in a pixel. This method fails with texture maps which have varying transparency (e.g. a texture map that represents a chain link fence). Quincunx anti-aliasing is a blur filter that shifts the rendered image a half-pixel up and a half-pixel left in order to create sub-pixels which are then averaged together in a diagonal cross pattern, destroying both jagged edges but also some overall image detail. Finally, the GeForce 3&#x27;s texture sampling units were upgraded to support 8-tap anisotropic filtering, compared to the previous limit of 2-tap with GeForce 2. With 8-tap anisotropic filtering enabled, distant textures can be noticeably sharper.

A derivative of the GeForce 3, known as the NV2A, is used in the Microsoft Xbox game console. It is clocked the same as the original GeForce 3 but features an additional vertex shader.

==Performance==
The GeForce 3 GPU (NV20) has the same theoretical pixel and texel throughput per clock as the GeForce 2 (NV15). The GeForce 2 Ultra is clocked 25% faster than the original GeForce 3 and 43% faster than the Ti200; this means that in select instances, like Direct3D 7 T&amp;L benchmarks, the GeForce 2 Ultra and sometimes even GTS can outperform the GeForce 3 and Ti200, because the newer GPUs use the same fixed-function T&amp;L unit, but are clocked lower. The GeForce 2 Ultra also has considerable raw memory bandwidth available to it, only matched by the GeForce 3 Ti500. However, when comparing anti-aliasing performance the GeForce 3 is clearly superior because of its MSAA support and memory bandwidth/fillrate management efficiency.

When comparing the shading capabilities to the Radeon 8500, reviewers noted superior precision with the ATi card.

==Product positioning==
Nvidia refreshed the lineup in October 2001 with the release of the GeForce 3 Ti200 and Ti500. This coincided with ATI&#x27;s releases of the Radeon 7500 and Radeon 8500. The Ti500 has higher core and memory clocks (240 MHz core/250 MHz RAM) than the original GeForce 3 (200 MHz/230 MHz), and generally matches the Radeon 8500 in performance. The Ti200 is clocked lower (175 MHz/200 MHz) making it the lowest-priced GeForce 3 release, but it still surpasses the Radeon 7500 in speed and feature set although lacking dual-monitor implementation.

The original GeForce3 and Ti500 were only released in 64 MiB configurations, while the Ti200 was also released as 128 MiB versions.

The GeForce 4 Ti (NV25), introduced in April 2002, was a revision of the GeForce 3 architecture. The GeForce 4 Ti was very similar to the GeForce 3; the main differences were higher core and memory speeds, a revised memory controller, improved vertex and pixel shaders, hardware anti-aliasing and DVD playback. Proper dual-monitor support was also brought over from the GeForce 2 MX. With the GeForce 4 Ti 4600 as the new flagship product, this was the beginning of the end of the GeForce 3 Ti 500 which was already difficult to produce due to poor yields, and it was later completely replaced by the much cheaper but similarly performing GeForce 4 Ti 4200. Also announced at the same time was the GeForce 4 MX (NV17), which despite the name was closer in terms of architecture and feature set to the GeForce 2 (NV 11 and NV15). The GeForce 3 Ti200 was still kept in production for a short while as it occupied a niche spot between the (delayed) GeForce 4 Ti4200 and GeForce 4 MX460, with performance equivalent to the DirectX 7.0 compliant MX460 while also having full DirectX 8.0 support, although lacking the ability to support dual-monitors. However, ATI released the Radeon 8500LE (a slower clocked version of the 8500) which outperformed both the Ti200 and MX460. ATI&#x27;s move in turn compelled Nvidia to roll out the Ti4200 earlier than planned, also at a similar price to the MX 460, and soon afterwards discontinuing the Ti200 by summer 2002 due to naming confusion with the GeForce 4 MX and Ti lines. The GeForce 3 Ti200 still outperforms the Radeon 9000 (RV250) that was introduced around the time of the Ti200&#x27;s discontinuation; as unlike the 8500LE which was just a slower-clocked 8500, the 9000 was a major redesign to reduce production cost and power usage; the Radeon 9000&#x27;s performance was equivalent to the GeForce 4 MX440.

<doc id="401121" wikidata="Q2229749" url="?curid=401121" title="List of counties of Poland">
<text>The following is an alphabetical list of all 380 county-level entities in [[Poland]].

A county or [[powiat]] (pronounced &quot;povyat,&quot; /pɔv.jät/) is the second level of Polish administrative division, between the [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] (provinces) and the [[gmina]] (municipalities or communes; plural &quot;gminy&quot;). The list includes the 314 &quot;land counties&quot; (&quot;powiaty ziemskie&quot;) and the 66 &quot;city counties&quot; (&quot;miasta na prawach powiatu&quot; or &quot;powiaty grodzkie&quot;). For general information about these entities, see the article on powiats.

The following information is given in the list:
*English name (as used in Wikipedia)
*Polish name (does not apply to most city counties, since these are not translated). Note that sometimes two different counties have the same name in Polish (for example, Brzeg County and Brzesko County both have the original name &quot;powiat brzeski&quot;).
*County seat (not given in the case of city counties, as the seat is simply the city itself). Note that sometimes the seat is not part of the county, being itself a separate city county; in these cases the name of the seat is asterisked.
*Voivodeship of which the county is a part.
*Area in square kilometres.
*Number of gminy into which the county is divided (not given in the case of city counties, since these always constitute a single gmina).
*Population (according to official figures for 2006 ).

For tables of counties by voivodeship, see the articles on the particular voivodeships (Greater Poland Voivodeship etc.).

<doc id="401133" wikidata="Q546204" url="?curid=401133" title="Preston Sturges">
<text>Preston Sturges (; born Edmund Preston Biden; August 29, 1898 – August 6, 1959) was an American playwright, screenwriter, and film director.

He is credited as being the first screenwriter to find success as a director. Prior to Sturges, other Hollywood directors (such as Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts; however, Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to establish success as a screenwriter and then move into directing his own scripts. He sold the story for &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; to Paramount Pictures for $10 in exchange for directing it. Anthony Lane writes that &quot;To us, that seems old hat, one of the paths by which the ambitious get to run their own show, but back in 1940, when &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; came out, it was very new hat indeed; the opening credits proclaimed &#x27;Written and directed by Preston Sturges,&#x27; and it was the first time in the history of talkies that the two passive verbs had appeared together onscreen. From that conjunction sprang a whole tradition of filmmaking: literate, spiky, defensive, markedly personal, and almost always funny.&quot; For that film, Sturges won the first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

Sturges went on to receive Oscar nominations for &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1944) and &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; (1944). He also wrote and directed &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (both 1941) and &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; (1942), each considered classic comedies, appearing on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs.

Per the documentary &quot;Preston Sturges: The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer&quot;, he opened the gates for generations of future filmmakers by becoming the first screenwriter to establish himself as a film director. In the process, he made himself one of the most celebrated figures of the 1940s. But his star, which had burned so brightly, fell almost as quickly as it had risen. To this day, this man who introduced irony to American screen comedy remains an enigmatic and contradictory personality: a lowbrow aristocrat and a melancholy wiseguy, he reaped the rewards and paid the price for being a brilliant American dreamer.

==Early life==
Sturges was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Mary Estelle Dempsey (later known as Mary Desti or Mary D&#x27;Este) and traveling salesman Edmund C. Biden. His maternal grandparents, Catherine Campbell Smyth and Dominick d&#x27;Este Dempsey, were immigrants from Ireland, and his father was of English descent.

When Sturges was two years old, his mother left America to pursue a singing career in Paris, where she annulled her marriage with Preston&#x27;s father. Returning to America, Dempsey met her third husband, the wealthy stockbroker Solomon Sturges, who adopted Preston in 1902. According to biographers, Solomon Sturges was &quot;diametrically opposite to Mary and her bohemianism&quot;. This included her close friendship with Isadora Duncan, as the young Sturges would sometimes travel from country to country with Duncan&#x27;s dance company. Mary also carried on a romantic affair with Aleister Crowley and collaborated with him on his magnum opus &quot;Magick&quot;. As a young man, Sturges bounced back and forth between Europe and the United States. As Sturges spent much of his youth in France, he became fluent in French and a Francophile who always considered France his &quot;second home&quot;.

In 1916, he worked as a runner for New York stock brokers, a position he obtained through Solomon Sturges. The next year, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Service, and graduated as a lieutenant from Camp Dick in Texas without seeing action. While at camp, Sturges wrote an essay, &quot;Three Hundred Words of Humor&quot;, which was printed in the camp newspaper, becoming his first published work. Returning from camp, in 1919 Sturges picked up a managing position at the Desti Emporium in New York, a store owned by his mother&#x27;s fourth husband. He spent eight years there, until he married Estelle De Wolfe.

Sturges&#x27;s 1928 turn to playwriting was accidental. While on a date with a young actress of certain renown, she informed Sturges that while she had pretended to find him witty and charming, she actually considered him a bore. &quot;The only reason I&#x27;m going out with you, sir, is for the same reason that a scientist embraces a guinea pig; I just like to try my situations out on you to see how they turn out.&quot; She claimed that the dramatic research was for a play she was writing. Outraged, Sturges told her that if she could write a play, he could write a play, but that his would be better and run longer. Within two months, he had written his first play, &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot;, only to find out that she wasn&#x27;t writing a play at all, and that she was surprised and flattered that he had taken her ravings so seriously.

==Career==

===From Broadway to Hollywood===
In 1928, Sturges performed on Broadway in &quot;Hotbed&quot;, a short-lived play by Paul Osborn, and Sturges&#x27;s &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot; opened in Massachusetts. The play was a success and Sturges moved it to Broadway the following year, a turning point in his career. That same year also saw the opening of Sturges&#x27;s second play, the hit &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot;. Written in just six days, the play ran for sixteen months and earned Sturges over $300,000. It attracted interest from Hollywood, and Sturges was writing for Paramount by the end of the year.

Three other Sturges stage plays were produced from 1930 to 1932, one of them a musical, but none were hits. By the end of the year, he was working more in Hollywood as a writer-for-hire, operating on short contracts, for Universal, MGM, and Columbia studios. He also sold his original screenplay for &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1933) to Fox, where it was filmed as a vehicle for Spencer Tracy. The film told the story of a self-involved financier via a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards, and has been seen as a precursor to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941). Fox producer Jesse Lasky had been prepared to customarily pass Sturges&#x27;s screenplay along to other writers for rewriting, but said, &quot;It was the most perfect script I&#x27;d ever seen ... Imagine a producer accepting a script from an author and not being able to make one change.&quot; Lasky paid Sturges $17,500 plus 7% of the profits above $1 million. It was a then-unprecedented deal for a screenwriter, which instantly elevated Sturges&#x27;s reputation in Hollywood – although the lucrative deal irritated as many as it impressed. Sturges recalled, &quot;The film made a lot of enemies. Writers at that time worked in teams, like piano movers. And my first solo script was considered a distinct menace to the profession.&quot;

For the remainder of the 1930s, Sturges operated under the strict auspices of the studio system, working on a string of scripts, some of which were shelved, sometimes with screen credit and sometimes not. While he was highly paid, earning $2,500 a week, he was unhappy with the way directors were handling his dialogue, and he resolved to take creative control of his own projects. He accomplished this goal in 1939 by trading his screenplay for &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; (written six years earlier) to Paramount in exchange for the chance to direct it. Paramount promoted the unusual deal as part of the film&#x27;s publicity, saying that Sturges had received just ten dollars. Sturges&#x27;s success quickly paved the way for similar deals for such writer–directors as Billy Wilder and John Huston. Sturges said, &quot;It&#x27;s taken me eight years to reach what I wanted. But now, if I don&#x27;t run out of ideas – and I won&#x27;t – we&#x27;ll have some fun. There are some wonderful pictures to be made, and God willing, I will make some of them.&quot;

===Screenwriting heights===
Sturges won the first-ever Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay for &quot;The Great McGinty&quot;, at which time he was one of the highest paid men in Hollywood. He also received two screenwriting Academy Award nominations in the same year, for 1944&#x27;s &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;, a feat since matched by Frank Butler, Francis Ford Coppola, and Oliver Stone. (In the second Academy Awards, under a different nomination process, eleven screenplays were considered, including two by Bess Meredyth, two by Tom Barry, two by Hanns Kräly and four by Elliott J. Clawson.) F. Scott Fitzgerald, then in Hollywood, wrote that &quot;They let a certain writer here direct his own picture here, and he&#x27;s made such a go of it that there may be a different feeling about that soon.&quot;

Though he had a thirty-year Hollywood career, Sturges&#x27;s greatest comedies were filmed in a furious five-year burst of activity from 1939 to 1944, during which he turned out &quot;The Great McGinty&quot;, &quot;Christmas in July&quot;, &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot;, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; and &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot;, for each of which he served as both writer and director. Half a century later, four of these – &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; – were chosen by the American Film Institute as being among the 100 funniest American films.

===Studio battles===

Production on these films did not always go smoothly. &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; was being written by Sturges at night even as the production was being filmed in the daytime, and Sturges the screenwriter was rarely more than 10 pages ahead of the cast and crew.

Despite box office success of &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;, conflict with Paramount&#x27;s studio bosses increased. In particular, executive producer Buddy DeSylva never really trusted his star writer-director and was wary (and arguably jealous) of the independence Sturges enjoyed on his projects. One of the sources of conflict was that Sturges liked to reuse many of the same character actors in his films, thus creating what amounted to a regular troupe he could call upon within the studio system. Paramount feared that the audience would tire of repeatedly seeing the same faces in Sturges productions. But the director was adamant, stating, &quot;[T]hese little players who had contributed so much to my first hits had a moral right to work in my subsequent pictures.&quot; The way Sturges wrote and directed these actors created a succession of what Andrew Sarris later called &quot;self-expressive cameos of aggressive individualism.&quot;

Members of the Preston Sturges Unofficial Stock Company Actors included: George Anderson, Al Bridge, Georgia Caine, Chester Conklin, Jimmy Conlin, William Demarest, Robert Dudley, Byron Foulger, Robert Greig, Harry Hayden, Esther Howard, Arthur Hoyt, J. Farrell MacDonald, George Melford, Torben Meyer, Charles R. Moore, Frank Moran, Jack Norton, Jane Buckingham, Franklin Pangborn, Emory Parnell, Victor Potel, Dewey Robinson, Harry Rosenthal, Julius Tannen, Max Wagner and Robert Warwick. Sturges re-used other actors, such as Sig Arno, Luis Alberni, Eric Blore, Porter Hall and Raymond Walburn, and even stars such as Joel McCrea and Rudy Vallee, who both made three films with Sturges, and Eddie Bracken, who did two.

The prolonged clashes between Sturges and Paramount came to a head as the end of his contract approached. He had filmed &quot;The Great Moment&quot; and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; in 1942 and &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; in 1943, but Paramount was suffering from a surfeit of films. Indeed, some of the studio&#x27;s finished movies were sold off to United Artists, which needed films to distribute. The studio held onto Sturges&#x27;s three films, since he was their star filmmaker at the time, but did not immediately release them.

Internally, studio heads expressed serious reservations about them, as did the censors at the Breen Office. Sturges managed to get &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; released with only minor changes, but &quot;The Great Moment&quot; and &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; were taken out of his control and tinkered with by DeSylva. When the revamped &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; had a disastrous preview, Paramount allowed Sturges – who by that time had left the studio – to come back and fix the film. Sturges did some rewriting, shot some new scenes, and re-edited the film back to his original vision, all without pay. He was unable to similarly rescue &quot;The Great Moment&quot;, however. The historical biography about the dentist who discovered the use of ether for anesthesia ended up being Sturges&#x27;s only flop during this period. More significantly, it marked the onset of a downturn from which Sturges did not fully recover.

===Independence and decline===
Preston Sturges was a temperamental talent who fully recognized his own worth. He had invested in entrepreneurial projects, such as an engineering company, and The Players, a popular restaurant and nightclub at 8225 Sunset Boulevard, projects which were both net losses. At one point the third highest paid man in America – for writing, directing, producing, and numerous other Hollywood projects – he was often known to borrow money (from his stepfather and studio, amongst others).

Millionaire Howard Hughes, who had formed a friendship with Sturges, offered to bankroll him as an independent filmmaker. In early 1944, Sturges and Hughes formed a partnership called California Pictures. The deal represented a major pay cut for Sturges, but it established him as a writer-producer-director, the only one in Hollywood besides Charles Chaplin and one of only four in the world, along with England&#x27;s Noël Coward and France&#x27;s René Clair. The status led, again, to widespread admiration and envy among his Hollywood peers.

However, this career peak also marked the beginning of Sturges&#x27;s professional decline as Hughes proved an unstable and mercurial partner. While the startup California Pictures was being created and structured, it was three years until Sturges&#x27;s next release. That film, a Harold Lloyd vehicle entitled &quot;The Sin of Harold Diddlebock&quot; (1947), for which Sturges had coaxed the silent film star out of retirement, went over budget and far behind schedule, and was poorly received when released. Hughes, who had promised not to interfere in the film&#x27;s production, stepped in and pulled the movie from distribution in order to re-edit it, taking almost four years to do so. Released in 1950 by RKO, which was by that time owned by Hughes, the retitled &quot;Mad Wednesday&quot; was no more successful than Sturges&#x27;s original version.

In the meantime, California Pictures had put another film into production, &quot;Vendetta&quot;. At Hughes&#x27;s behest, Sturges had written the script as a vehicle for Hughes&#x27; protégé, Faith Domergue. Max Ophüls was hired to direct, but after only a few days of filming, Hughes demanded that Sturges fire Ophüls and take over the direction himself. Seven weeks later, Sturges himself was fired or quit (accounts differ). The promising partnership between the two iconoclasts was dissolved after just one completed picture. As Sturges later recalled, &quot;When Mr. Hughes made suggestions with which I disagreed, as he had a perfect right to do, I rejected them. When I rejected the last one, he remembered he had an option to take control of the company and he took over. So I left.&quot;

Coming on the heels of the failure of &quot;The Great Moment&quot;, these further flops, disappointments and setbacks served to tarnish the once stellar reputation of the golden boy of Hollywood. Sturges was left professionally adrift. Accepting an offer from Darryl Zanuck, he landed at Fox where he wrote, directed, and produced two films. The first, &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; (1948), was not initially well received by either reviewers or the public, though its critical reputation has since improved. However, his second Fox film, &quot;The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend&quot; (1949), was the first serious flop in star Betty Grable&#x27;s career, and Sturges was again on his own. He built a theater at his Players restaurant, but the project did not pan out.

Over the next several years, Sturges continued to write, but many of the projects were underfunded or stillborn, and those that emerged did not approach the same success as his earlier triumphs. His 1951 Broadway musical, &quot;Make a Wish&quot;, underwent extensive rewriting by Abe Burrows and ran for only a few months. His next Broadway project, &quot;Carnival in Flanders&quot;, a musical which Sturges wrote and directed in 1953, closed after six performances.

Sturges was having no better luck in Hollywood, where his clout was gone. Katharine Hepburn, who had starred in the 1952 Broadway production of the George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Millionairess&quot; got Sturges to agree to adapt the script and direct. But she could not get a single Hollywood studio to back the project.

A 1953 lien by the Internal Revenue Service, with whom he had been having tax problems, cost Sturges the Players nightclub and other assets. Sturges put a brave public face on the situation, writing, &quot;I had so very much for so very long, it is quite natural for the pendulum to swing the other way for a while, and I really cannot and will not complain.&quot; However, his drinking became heavy, and his marriage and many of his relationships continued to deteriorate.

Sturges began spending more time in Europe, as he had as a young man. His last directorial effort took place there when he wrote and directed &quot;Les Carnets du Major Thompson&quot;, an adaptation of a popular French novel. The film was released in France in 1955 and two years later in the U.S., under the title &quot;The French, They Are a Funny Race&quot;. It failed to register with critics or audiences.

Sturges made four brief cameo appearances during his career: in his own &quot;Christmas in July&quot; and &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;; in the Paramount all-star extravaganza &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; and, in the years of his decline, in the Bob Hope comedy &quot;Paris Holiday&quot;, filmed in France and the last film he worked on. Two decades earlier, Sturges had been a writer on one of Hope&#x27;s earliest film successes, &quot;Never Say Die&quot;.

In 1959, Sturges summed up his career:

Between flops, it is true, I have come up with an occasional hit, but compared to a good boxer&#x27;s record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone&#x27;s astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have been locked up. Why I&#x27;m not walking on my heels after all this, I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I &quot;am&quot; walking on my heels. It would be surprising if I weren&#x27;t.

==Themes==
According to Todd McCarthy, &quot;A continuing theme of Preston Sturges is that a good front or guise can easily bamboozle the public.&quot; McCarthy cites Sturges&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Diamond Jim&quot; (1935). The critic Ephraim Katz wrote that Sturges&#x27;s films &quot;... parodied with pungent wit various aspects of American life from politics and advertising to sex and hero worship. They were marked by their verbal wit, opportune comic timing, and eccentric, outrageously funny camo characterizations.&quot; Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;Sturges repeatedly suggested that the lowliest boob could rise to the top with the right degree of luck, bluff, and fraud.&quot;

In 1942, in his review of &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot;, critic Manny Farber wrote:
He is essentially a satirist without any stable point of view from which to aim his satire. He is apt to turn his back on what he has been sniping at to demolish what he has just been defending. He is contemptuous of everybody except the opportunist and the unscrupulous little woman who, at some point in every picture, labels the hero a poor sap. That the invariable fairy godfather of each picture is not only expressive of his own cold-blooded cynicism but of typical Hollywood fantasy is an example of how this works. Another phase of his attack is shrouding in slapstick the fact that the godfather pays off not for perseverance or honesty or ability but merely from capriciousness.

Anthony Lane writes that his films are peopled, to an alarming degree, by families that don&#x27;t add up, and by couples who click together and them come apart like toys. The hero of &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; marries his secretary (who already has children of her own) purely because, as an aspirant political thug, he needs a mate. Most startling is &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot;, in which Claudette Colbert runs out on her husband (Joel McCrea) even though her toes go all funny whenever he kisses her; she simply needs more money in her life, and that means somebody else. The movie starts and ends with the curlicued words &quot;And they all lived happily ever&quot; after filling the screen, followed at once by the jaunty rider &quot;Or did they?&quot; At no point in a Sturges comedy does a happy family sit around being a happy family; you could read that as a psychotic reaction to his own precarious parentage, but I prefer to think that Sturges was so taken by the drama of his origins that he chose to milk it dry.

James Agee called Sturges&#x27;s films &quot;uncontrollably, almost proudly corrupt, vengeful, fearful of intactness and self-commitment ... their mastering object, aside from success, seems to be to sail as deep into the wind as possible without for an instant incurring the disaster of becoming seriously wholly acceptable as art. They seem to be, indeed, in much of their twisting, the elaborately counterpointed image of a neurosis.

==Style and influence==
Sturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It is not uncommon for a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. Such versatility and dexterity can be seen in &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, where a tender love scene takes place between Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck, which is enlivened by a horse as it repeatedly pokes its nose into Fonda&#x27;s head. Critic Andrew Dickos wrote that &quot;the touchstone of Preston Sturges&#x27; screenwriting lies in the respect paid to the play and density of verbal language&quot; and &quot;establishes the standard of eloquence as one of poetry, of a cacophony of Euro-American vernacularisms and utterances, peculiarly—and appropriately—spoken with scandalous indifference.&quot;

His scripts were almost congenitally unable to deliver a single mood. In &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot;, the series of lies, crimes, and embarrassments all somehow bolster the film&#x27;s theme of patriotism and duty. Sometimes this attitude could be conveyed in a single line of dialogue, such as in &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; when Jean Harrington (Stanwyck) vows revenge on Charles Pike (Fonda), declaring, &quot;I need him like the axe needs the turkey.&quot;

In recent years, film scholars such as Alessandro Pirolini have also argued that Sturges&#x27;s cinema anticipated more experimental narratives by contemporary directors such as Joel and Ethan Coen, Robert Zemeckis and Woody Allen, along with prolific &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer John Swartzwelder: &quot;Many of [Sturges&#x27;s] movies and screenplays reveal a restless and impatient attempt to escape codified rules and narrative schemata, and to push the mechanisms and conventions of their genre to the extent of unveiling them to the spectator. See for example the disruption of standardized timelines in films such as &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; and &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; or the way an apparently classical comedy such as &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; (1948) shifts into the realm of multiple and hypothetical narratives.&quot;

Filmmakers who have acknowledged Sturges as an influence include the Coen brothers, Wes Anderson, James Mangold, John Hughes, Peter Bogdanovich and John Lasseter.

==Personal life==
Sturges married four times and had three sons:

*Estelle deWolfe Mudge – married in December 1923, separated in 1927, divorced in 1928

==Death==
Sturges died of a heart attack at the Algonquin Hotel while writing his autobiography (which, ironically, he had intended to title &quot;The Events Leading Up to My Death&quot;), and was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. His book, &quot;Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges: His Life in His Words&quot;, was published in 1990. In 1975, he became the first writer to be given the Screen Writers Guild&#x27;s Laurel Award posthumously. He has a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1601 Vine Street.

<text>Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon (also known by his pseudonym &quot;Fyodor Vaskovich&quot;). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection. These features are extensible by scripts that provide more advanced service detection, vulnerability detection, and other features. Nmap can adapt to network conditions including latency and congestion during a scan.

Nmap started as a Linux utility and was ported to other systems including Windows, macOS, and BSD. It is most popular on Linux, followed by Windows.

==Features==
Nmap features include:
* Fast scan (&quot;nmap -F [target]&quot;) – Performing a basic port scan for fast result.
* Host discovery – Identifying hosts on a network. For example, listing the hosts that respond to TCP and/or ICMP requests or have a particular port open.
* Port scanning – Enumerating the open ports on target hosts.
* Version detection – Interrogating network services on remote devices to determine application name and version number.
* Ping Scan – Check host by sending ping requests.
* TCP/IP stack fingerprinting – Determining the operating system and hardware characteristics of network devices based on observations of network activity of said devices.
* Scriptable interaction with the target – using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) and Lua programming language.

Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, device types, and MAC addresses.

Typical uses of Nmap:
* Auditing the security of a device or firewall by identifying the network connections which can be made to, or through it.
* Identifying open ports on a target host in preparation for auditing.
* Network inventory, network mapping, maintenance and asset management.
* Auditing the security of a network by identifying new servers.
* Generating traffic to hosts on a network, response analysis and response time measurement.
* Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a network.
* DNS queries and subdomain search

==User interfaces==
NmapFE, originally written by Kanchan, was Nmap&#x27;s official GUI for Nmap versions 2.2 to 4.22. For Nmap 4.50 (originally in the 4.22SOC development series) NmapFE was replaced with Zenmap, a new official graphical user interface based on UMIT, developed by Adriano Monteiro Marques.

Web-based interfaces exist that allow either controlling Nmap or analysing Nmap results from a web browser, such as IVRE.

==Output==
Four different output formats are offered by Nmap. Everything is saved to a file except the interactive output. Text processing software can be used to modify Nmap output, allowing the user to customize reports.

; Interactive: presented and updated real time when a user runs Nmap from the command line. Various options can be entered during the scan to facilitate monitoring.
; XML: a format that can be further processed by XML tools. It can be converted into a HTML report using XSLT.
; Grepable: output that is tailored to line-oriented processing tools such as grep, sed, or awk.
; Normal: the output as seen while running Nmap from the command line, but saved to a file.
; Script kiddie:meant to be an amusing way to format the interactive output replacing letters with their visually alike number representations. For example, codice_1 becomes codice_2. This is known as Leet.

==History==
Nmap was first published in September 1997, as an article in Phrack Magazine with source-code included. With help and contributions of the computer security community, development continued. Enhancements included operating system fingerprinting, service fingerprinting, code rewrites (C to C++), additional scan types, protocol support (e.g. IPv6, SCTP) and new programs that complement Nmap&#x27;s core features.

Major releases include:
==Legal issues==
Nmap is a tool that can be used to discover services running on Internet connected systems. Like any tool, it could potentially be used for black hat hacking, as a precursor to attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems. However, Nmap is also used by security and systems administrators to assess their own networks for vulnerabilities (i.e. white hat hacking).

System administrators can use Nmap to search for unauthorized servers, or for computers that do not conform to security standards.

In 2003 Supreme Court of Finland has ruled that port scanning has amounted to an attempted computer break in, which was illegal under Finnish Penal code at the time:&quot;In its ruling the Supreme Court stated that the defendant had systematically carried out port scanning operations to gather information for the purpose of unauthorised break-in to the bank&#x27;s computer network. This amounted to an attempted computer break in.&quot;

==License==
Nmap was originally distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). In later releases, Nmap&#x27;s authors added clarifications and specific interpretations to the license where they felt the GPL was unclear or lacking. For instance, Nmap 3.50 specifically revoked the license of SCO Group to distribute Nmap software because of their views on the SCO-Linux controversies.

Starting with version 7.90, Nmap transitions to a new custom license NPSL, dual-licensing versions 7.90, 7.91, and 7.92 under both old and new licenses. Several Linux distributions consider the new license non-free.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, Trinity is seen using Nmap to access a power plant&#x27;s computer system, allowing Neo to &quot;physically&quot; break into a building. The appearance of Nmap in the film was widely discussed on Internet forums and hailed as an unusually realistic example of hacking.

Nmap and NmapFE were used in &quot;The Listening&quot;, a 2006 movie about a former NSA officer who defects and mounts a clandestine counter-listening station high in the Italian alps.

Nmap source code can be seen in the movie &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, as well as brief views of the command line version of Nmap executing in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Bourne Ultimatum&quot;. In 2013, Nmap continued to make appearances in movies including popular sci-fi movie &quot;Elysium&quot;.

The film &quot;Dredd&quot;, a film adaptation of the famous Judge Dredd comics, was released in 2012 and also contains multiple Nmap scenes. Nmap is used for network reconnaissance and exploitation of the slum tower network. It is even seen briefly in the movie&#x27;s trailer.

The command Nmap is widely used in the video game &quot;Hacknet&quot;, allowing to probe the network ports of a target system to hack it.

In &quot;Snowden&quot;, Nmap is used in the aptitude test scene about 14 minutes into the movie.

==In academia==
Nmap is an integral part of academic activities. It has been used for research involving the TCP/IP protocol suite and networking in general. Besides being a research tool, Nmap has also become a research topic.

<text>Francesco Cetti (9 August 1726 – 20 November 1778) was an Italian Jesuit priest, zoologist and mathematician.


==Biography==
Cetti was born in Mannheim in Germany, but his parents were natives of Como. He was educated in Lombardy and at the Jesuit college at Monza. 

He entered the Jesuit novitiate in Milan on 12 October 1742, and professed the four vows on 2 February 1760. He devoted himself to scientific studies and taught for several years philosophy and mathematics at the Jesuit College of Brera, soon becoming one of the most prominent members of the Milanese province.

In 1765 he was sent to Sardinia to help improve the standard of education on the island. In 1766 he was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Sassari, holding that position until his death.

Cetti took long excursions in the vicinity of Sassari, collating his discoveries in the &quot;Storia Naturale di Sardegna&quot; (Natural History of Sardinia, 1774–7). This has three volumes, covering mammals, birds and amphibians with fishes. A supplement on mammals was published in 1777.

Cetti is commemorated in the name of the Cetti&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Cettia cetti&quot;), which was collected on Sardinia by Alberto della Marmora.

<text>Timothy Andrew Fischer (3 May 1946 – 22 August 2019) was an Australian politician and diplomat who served as leader of the National Party from 1990 to 1999. He was the tenth deputy prime minister in the Howard government from 1996 to 1999.

Fischer was born in Lockhart, New South Wales. He served with the Australian Army in the Vietnam War. On his return he bought a farming property at Boree Creek. He served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1984. Fischer was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1984 election, representing the Division of Farrer until his retirement in 2001. He replaced Charles Blunt as leader of the National Party in 1990, and in the Howard government served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. After leaving politics, Fischer served as chairman of Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2007, and was later Ambassador to the Holy See from 2009 to 2012.

==Early life==
Fischer was born on 3 May 1946 in Lockhart, New South Wales. He was the fourth of five children born to Barbara Mary () and Julius Ralph Fischer; he was predeceased by an older brother who died of meningitis as an infant. His parents were &quot;from once wealthy Melbourne families whose businesses had collapsed with the onset of the Great Depression&quot;. Fischer&#x27;s father worked as a jackaroo, settling in Boree Creek, New South Wales, in 1936, where he ran a stock and station agency and later bought a small farm. His paternal grandfather was born in Kleve, Germany, and had his assets frozen due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. His paternal grandmother was the daughter of a French seaman. Fischer&#x27;s mother worked as a nurse prior to her marriage. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch immigrant who married the daughter of Francis Mason, an Irish immigrant who became speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.

Fischer grew up on the family property at Boree Creek and attended Boree Creek Public School for six years. From 1958 he boarded at Xavier College in Melbourne. He graduated in 1963 and won a scholarship to attend university, but returned to Boree Creek to assist his family. In 1966 he was conscripted into the Australian Army and commissioned at the Officer Training Unit, Scheyville. Fischer served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) between July 1966 and March 1969 as a second lieutenant. With his battalion, he served in the Vietnam War. Fischer was wounded in the Battle of Coral-Balmoral in May–June 1968. 1RAR and the 1st Australian Task Force were awarded Unit Citation for Gallantry for their actions Battle of Coral-Balmoral and Fischer was entitled to wear the citation insignia.

Upon his return from Vietnam, Fischer took over the family property at Boree Creek and became active in the Country Party, as the party was then called.

==Career==
===State politics===
Fischer represented Sturt in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1980 and Murray from 1980 to 1984. He served on the opposition frontbench from 1978 to 1984.

===Federal politics===

In 1984, Fischer won the federal seat of Farrer in the New South Wales far west for the National Party of Australia, as the Country Party had been renamed. Within a year he was on the opposition frontbench, and soon became a popular figure in both the party and parliament. His sometimes rustic manner and bumbling English concealed a shrewd political brain. In 1990, when an attempt by Charles Blunt to modernise the Nationals&#x27; image ended with him losing his own seat, Fischer succeeded him as leader, defeating the former leader Ian Sinclair.

Fischer was an enthusiastic supporter of the &quot;Fightback&quot; package of economic and tax reforms proposed by the Liberal leader John Hewson in 1991. But he was unsuccessful in persuading the majority of rural voters, particularly in Queensland, that the proposed changes, particularly the goods and services tax, were in their interests, and Labor under Paul Keating won the 1993 election. On 23 March 1993, ten days after the election, Ian Sinclair unsuccessfully challenged Fischer for the leadership.

In January 1994, Fischer suffered head and neck injuries in a car accident south of his property in Lockhart, New South Wales. His car T-boned a vehicle that had failed to yield to a give-way sign; the driver and passenger in the other vehicle were killed. Fischer was knocked unconscious in the accident and taken to hospital in Wagga Wagga. He took a month off from politics to aid his recovery, with his deputy John Anderson acting as party leader in his absence.

The Liberals finally regained office under John Howard in 1996. Fischer became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. The Liberals had won a majority in their own right in the 1996 election, leaving the Nationals in a much weaker position compared to previous Coalition governments. Nonetheless, Fischer was fairly active. He supported the government introducing tough gun control measures on automatic and semi-automatic weapons following the Port Arthur massacre in April 1996 alongside then-prime minister John Howard, measures which were opposed by much of his party&#x27;s rural base.

Fischer also had difficulty with the determination of many Liberals, including the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to carry out sweeping free-market reforms, including abolishing tariff protection for rural industries, deregulating petrol prices and implementing other measures which farmers&#x27; organisations regarded as harmful to themselves.

In pushing to permanently extinguish native title rights of indigenous Australians following the Mabo and Wik decisions, Fischer attracted much criticism.

Further trouble for Fischer and the Nationals came with the rise of One Nation, a right-wing populist party led by Pauline Hanson, a disendorsed Liberal candidate who was nonetheless elected member for the Queensland seat of Oxley at the 1996 federal election. One Nation had its greatest appeal in country areas of New South Wales and Queensland—the Nationals&#x27; traditional heartland. For much of 1997 and 1998, it looked as though One Nation might sweep the Nationals out of existence. In the 1998 election campaign, however, Fischer strongly counter-attacked One Nation, mainly on the grounds of their &quot;flat tax&quot; economic policies, and succeeded in holding the Nationals&#x27; losses to one Senate seat in Queensland.

In 2001, shortly before the expiry of his last parliamentary term, Fischer made public his support for an Australian republic in the future.

As an MP, and later as leader of the Nationals, Fischer often had a rather hectic schedule of visits to various rural National branch meetings, and other relevant functions and gatherings. As a result, he earned the affectionate nickname of &quot;Two-Minute Tim&quot; – often he would arrive, speak to the gathering for a few minutes (i.e. the &quot;Two-Minutes&quot;), grab a quick bite to eat while chatting to some of the attendees, then have to head off to the next stop on his schedule.

In 2014 it was revealed on the ABC program &quot;A Country Road&quot; that sometime before the 1998 federal election, Fischer, then National Party leader, had met with his deputy John Anderson and former minister John Sharp for a luncheon at which they were surprised to learn from each other that they all intended to retire at the forthcoming election. They agreed that it was not a good idea for all of them to retire at the same time, as it could give a negative image to the party which at the time was battling against perceptions that its future was uncertain. In the end, only Sharp retired, with Fischer and Anderson delaying their own retirements and successfully recontesting the election.

In 1999, he surprised his colleagues by resigning as party leader and as a minister, and by announcing that he would retire at the election due in 2001. His decision to quit politics was motivated partly by the demands of his family, in particular that his son Harrison has autism (Fischer himself claimed to have &quot;high functioning&quot; autism, though he was never professionally diagnosed).

Fischer is the only person to have served the entirety of his ministerial career as Deputy Prime Minister.

===Post-political career===
After his retirement, he returned to farming at Boree Creek, and became involved in charity work, assisting organisations such as the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Fred Hollows Foundation and Autism New South Wales.

Fischer served as chairman of Tourism Australia from 2004 until 2007. He was made a fellow (FTSE) of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) in 2000. He served as chairman and a patron of the Crawford Fund, an initiative of the ATSE supporting international agricultural research, from 2001 to 2006. He was vice-chair and chair of the Crop Trust (2013–2017) and a &quot;vigorous supporter&quot; of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. He served as national chairman of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. He also served as founding Patron of Australia for UNHCR (2001–2006), an Australian charity that raises funds for the UN&#x27;s refugee agency.

Fischer was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 2005 Australia Day Honours&#x27; List in recognition of his contributions to Australian politics, trade liberalisation, rail transport development, support of humanitarian aid, and to fostering community acceptance of cultural differences.

On 21 July 2008, Fischer was nominated by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as the first resident Australian Ambassador to the Holy See. Fischer worked closely with the Vatican on all aspects of the canonisation of Australia&#x27;s first Roman Catholic saint, Mary MacKillop. He retired from the post on 20 January 2012.

In August 2013, following the shooting death of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane in Oklahoma, Fischer called for a tourism boycott of the United States to protest the activities of the National Rifle Association of America and what he felt were overly lax American gun laws.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Fischer married Judy Brewer. They had two sons.

Fischer was noted as a tireless advocate for rail transport and was probably Australia&#x27;s best known railfan. He had a childhood hobby of studying rail gauges of the world. After retiring from politics he continued his association with rail as special envoy for the Adelaide to Darwin railway line and travelled on the first freight train and first &quot;Ghan&quot; passenger train to Darwin in 2004. The V class GT46C locomotive V544, owned and operated by Aurizon, is named after him. In 2007 he led the Rail Freight Network Review into rail freight in Victoria, as commissioned by the Victorian Government.

Between 2008 and 2009, Fischer hosted three series of ABC Local Radio podcasts &quot;The Great Train Show&quot;, covering a wide range of railway topics from around the world and within Australia.

In October 2018, Fischer was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. He died on 22 August 2019 at the Albury-Wodonga Cancer Centre in East Albury, New South Wales at age 73. Fischer himself attributed the illness to exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam. Fischer was given a state funeral, which was held in Albury on 29 August 2019.

<doc id="401150" wikidata="Q748049" url="?curid=401150" title="Photoreceptor cell">
<text>A photoreceptor cell is a specialized type of neuroepithelial cell found in the retina that is capable of visual phototransduction. The great biological importance of photoreceptors is that they convert light (visible electromagnetic radiation) into signals that can stimulate biological processes. To be more specific, photoreceptor proteins in the cell absorb photons, triggering a change in the cell&#x27;s membrane potential.

There are currently three known types of photoreceptor cells in mammalian eyes: rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. The two classic photoreceptor cells are rods and cones, each contributing information used by the visual system to form an image of the environment, sight. Rods primarily mediate scotopic vision (dim conditions) whereas cones primarily mediate photopic vision (bright conditions), but the processes in each that supports phototransduction is similar. The intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells were discovered during the 1990s. These cells are thought not to contribute to sight directly, but have a role in the entrainment of the circadian rhythm and the pupillary reflex.

== Photosensitivity ==
Each photoreceptor absorbs light according to its spectral sensitivity (absorptance), which is determined by the photoreceptor proteins expressed in that cell. Humans have three classes of cones (L, M, S) that each differ in spectral sensitivity and &#x27;prefer&#x27; photons of different wavelengths (see graph). For example, the peak wavelength of the S-cone&#x27;s spectral sensitivity is approximately 420 nm (nanometers, a measure of wavelength), so it is more likely to absorb a photon at 420 nm than at any other wavelength. Light of a longer wavelength can also produce the same response from an S-cone, but it would have to be brighter to do so.

In accordance with the principle of univariance, a photoreceptor&#x27;s output signal is proportional only to the number of photons absorbed. The photoreceptors can not measure the wavelength of light that it absorbs and therefore does not detect color on its own. Rather, it is the ratios of responses of the three types of cone cells that can estimate wavelength, and therefore enable color vision.

== Histology ==

Rod and cone photoreceptors are found on the outermost layer of the retina; they both have the same basic structure. Closest to the visual field (and farthest from the brain) is the axon terminal, which releases a neurotransmitter called glutamate to bipolar cells. Farther back is the cell body, which contains the cell&#x27;s organelles. Farther back still is the inner segment, a specialized part of the cell full of mitochondria. The chief function of the inner segment is to provide ATP (energy) for the sodium-potassium pump. Finally, closest to the brain (and farthest from the field of view) is the outer segment, the part of the photoreceptor that absorbs light. Outer segments are actually modified cilia that contain disks filled with opsin, the molecule that absorbs photons, as well as voltage-gated sodium channels.

The membranous photoreceptor protein &quot;opsin&quot; contains a pigment molecule called &quot;retinal&quot;. In rod cells, these together are called rhodopsin. In cone cells, there are different types of opsins that combine with retinal to form pigments called photopsins. Three different classes of photopsins in the cones react to different ranges of light frequency, a selectivity that allows the visual system to transduce color. The function of the photoreceptor cell is to convert the light information of the photon into a form of information communicable to the nervous system and readily usable to the organism: This conversion is called signal transduction.

The opsin found in the intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells of the retina is called melanopsin. These cells are involved in various reflexive responses of the brain and body to the presence of (day)light, such as the regulation of circadian rhythms, pupillary reflex and other non-visual responses to light. Melanopsin functionally resembles invertebrate opsins.

== Retinal mosaic ==


Most vertebrate photoreceptors are located in the retina. The distribution of rods and cones (and classes thereof) in the retina is called the retinal mosaic. Each human retina has approximately 6 million cones and 120 million rods. At the &quot;center&quot; of the retina (the point directly behind the lens) lies the fovea (or fovea centralis), which contains only cone cells; and is the region capable of producing the highest visual acuity or highest resolution. Across the rest of the retina, rods and cones are intermingled. No photoreceptors are found at the blind spot, the area where ganglion cell fibers are collected into the optic nerve and leave the eye. The distribution of cone classes (L, M, S) are also nonhomogenous, with no S-cones in the fovea, and the ratio of L-cones to M-cones differing between individuals.

The number and ratio of rods to cones varies among species, dependent on whether an animal is primarily diurnal or nocturnal. Certain owls, such as the nocturnal tawny owl, have a tremendous number of rods in their retinae. Other vertebrates will also have a different number of cone classes, ranging from monochromats to pentachromats.

== Signaling ==

The path of a visual signal is described by the phototransduction cascade, the mechanism by which the energy of a photon signals a mechanism in the cell that leads to its electrical polarization. This polarization ultimately leads to either the transmittance or inhibition of a neural signal that will be fed to the brain via the optic nerve. The steps that apply to the phototransduction pathway from vertebrate rod/cone photoreceptors are:

#The Vertebrate visual opsin in the disc membrane of the outer segment absorbs a photon, changing the configuration of a retinal Schiff base cofactor inside the protein from the cis-form to the trans-form, causing the retinal to change shape.
#This results in a series of unstable intermediates, the last of which binds stronger to a G protein in the membrane, called transducin, and activates it. This is the first amplification step – each photoactivated opsin triggers activation of about 100 transducins. 
#Each transducin then activates the enzyme cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE).
#PDE then catalyzes the hydrolysis of cGMP to 5&#x27; GMP. This is the second amplification step, where a single PDE hydrolyses about 1000 cGMP molecules.
#The net concentration of intracellular cGMP is reduced (due to its conversion to 5&#x27; GMP via PDE), resulting in the closure of cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+ ion channels located in the photoreceptor outer segment membrane.
#As a result, sodium ions can no longer enter the cell, and the photoreceptor outer segment membrane becomes hyperpolarized, due to the charge inside the membrane becoming more negative.
#This change in the cell&#x27;s membrane potential causes voltage-gated calcium channels to close. This leads to a decrease in the influx of calcium ions into the cell and thus the intracellular calcium ion concentration falls.
#A decrease in the intracellular calcium concentration means that less glutamate is released via calcium-induced exocytosis to the bipolar cell (see below). (The decreased calcium level slows the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which excites the postsynaptic bipolar cells and horizontal cells.)
#ATP provided by the inner segment powers the sodium-potassium pump. This pump is necessary to reset the initial state of the outer segment by taking the sodium ions that are entering the cell and pumping them back out.

===Hyperpolarization===
Unlike most sensory receptor cells, photoreceptors actually become hyperpolarized when stimulated; and conversely are depolarized when not stimulated. This means that glutamate is released continuously when the cell is unstimulated, and stimulus causes release to stop. In the dark, cells have a relatively high concentration of cyclic guanosine 3&#x27;-5&#x27; monophosphate (cGMP), which opens cGMP-gated ion channels. These channels are nonspecific, allowing movement of both sodium and calcium ions when open. The movement of these positively charged ions into the cell (driven by their respective electrochemical gradient) depolarizes the membrane, and leads to the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.

Unstimulated (in the dark), cyclic-nucleotide gated channels in the outer segment are open because cyclic GMP (cGMP) is bound to them. Hence, positively charged ions (namely sodium ions) enter the photoreceptor, depolarizing it to about −40 mV (resting potential in other nerve cells is usually −65 mV). This depolarization current is often known as dark current.

===Bipolar cells===
The photoreceptors (&quot;rods&quot; and &quot;cones&quot;) transmit to the bipolar cells, which transmit then to the retinal ganglion cells. Retinal ganglion cell axons collectively form the optic nerve, via which they project to the brain.

The rod and cone photoreceptors signal their absorption of photons via a decrease in the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate to bipolar cells at its axon terminal. Since the photoreceptor is depolarized in the dark, a high amount of glutamate is being released to bipolar cells in the dark. Absorption of a photon will hyperpolarize the photoreceptor and therefore result in the release of &quot;less&quot; glutamate at the presynaptic terminal to the bipolar cell.

Every rod or cone photoreceptor releases the same neurotransmitter, glutamate. However, the effect of glutamate differs in the bipolar cells, depending upon the type of receptor imbedded in that cell&#x27;s membrane. When glutamate binds to an ionotropic receptor, the bipolar cell will depolarize (and therefore will hyperpolarize with light as less glutamate is released). On the other hand, binding of glutamate to a metabotropic receptor results in a hyperpolarization, so this bipolar cell will depolarize to light as less glutamate is released.

In essence, this property allows for one population of bipolar cells that gets excited by light and another population that gets inhibited by it, even though all photoreceptors show the same response to light. This complexity becomes both important and necessary for detecting color, contrast, edges, etc.

=== Advantages ===
Phototransduction in rods and cones is somewhat unusual in that the stimulus (in this case, light) reduces the cell&#x27;s response or firing rate, different from most other sensory systems in which a stimulus increases the cell&#x27;s response or firing rate. This difference has important functional consequences:
# the classic (rod or cone) photoreceptor is depolarized in the dark, which means many sodium ions are flowing into the cell. Thus, the random opening or closing of sodium channels will not affect the membrane potential of the cell; only the closing of a large number of channels, through absorption of a photon, will affect it and signal that light is in the visual field. This system may have less noise relative to sensory transduction schema that increase rate of neural firing in response to stimulus, like touch and olfaction.
# there is a lot of amplification in two stages of classic phototransduction: one pigment will activate many molecules of transducin, and one PDE will cleave many cGMPs. This amplification means that even the absorption of one photon will affect membrane potential and signal to the brain that light is in the visual field. This is the main feature that differentiates rod photoreceptors from cone photoreceptors. Rods are extremely sensitive and have the capacity of registering a single photon of light, unlike cones. On the other hand, cones are known to have very fast kinetics in terms of rate of amplification of phototransduction, unlike rods.

== Difference between rods and cones ==

== Development ==
The key events mediating rod versus S cone versus M cone differentiation are induced by several transcription factors, including RORbeta, OTX2, NRL, CRX, NR2E3 and TRbeta2. The S cone fate represents the default photoreceptor program; however, differential transcriptional activity can bring about rod or M cone generation. L cones are present in primates, however there is not much known for their developmental program due to use of rodents in research. There are five steps to developing photoreceptors: proliferation of multi-potent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs); restriction of competence of RPCs; cell fate specification; photoreceptor gene expression; and lastly axonal growth, synapse formation and outer segment growth.

Early Notch signaling maintains progenitor cycling. Photoreceptor precursors come about through inhibition of Notch signaling and increased activity of various factors including achaete-scute homologue 1. OTX2 activity commits cells to the photoreceptor fate. CRX further defines the photoreceptor specific panel of genes being expressed. NRL expression leads to the rod fate. NR2E3 further restricts cells to the rod fate by repressing cone genes. RORbeta is needed for both rod and cone development. TRbeta2 mediates the M cone fate. If any of the previously mentioned factors&#x27; functions are ablated, the default photoreceptor is a S cone. These events take place at different time periods for different species and include a complex pattern of activities that bring about a spectrum of phenotypes. If these regulatory networks are disrupted, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration or other visual deficits may result.

== Ganglion cell photoreceptors ==

Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are a subset (≈1–3%) of retinal ganglion cells, unlike other retinal ganglion cells, are intrinsically photosensitive due to the presence of melanopsin, a light-sensitive protein. Therefore they constitute a third class of photoreceptors, in addition to rod and cone cells.

In humans the ipRGCs contribute to non-image-forming functions like circadian rhythms, behavior and pupillary light reflex. Peak spectral sensitivity of the receptor is between 460 and 482 nm. However, they may also contribute to a rudimentary visual pathway enabling conscious sight and brightness detection. Classic photoreceptors (rods and cones) also feed into the novel visual system, which may contribute to color constancy. ipRGCs could be instrumental in understanding many diseases including major causes of blindness worldwide like glaucoma, a disease that affects ganglion cells, and the study of the receptor offered potential as a new avenue to explore in trying to find treatments for blindness.

ipRGCs were only definitively detected ipRGCs in humans during landmark experiments in 2007 on rodless, coneless humans. As had been found in other mammals, the identity of the non-rod non-cone photoreceptor in humans was found to be a ganglion cell in the inner retina. The researchers had tracked down patients with rare diseases wiping out classic rod and cone photoreceptor function but preserving ganglion cell function. Despite having no rods or cones the patients continued to exhibit circadian photoentrainment, circadian behavioural patterns, melanopsin suppression, and pupil reactions, with peak spectral sensitivities to environmental and experimental light matching that for the melanopsin photopigment. Their brains could also associate vision with light of this frequency.

==Non-human photoreceptors==
Rod and cone photoreceptors are common to almost all vertebrates. The pineal and parapineal glands are photoreceptive in non-mammalian vertebrates, but not in mammals. Birds have photoactive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting neurons within the paraventricular organ that respond to light in the absence of input from the eyes or neurotransmitters. Invertebrate photoreceptors in organisms such as insects and molluscs are different in both their morphological organization and their underlying biochemical pathways. This article describes human photoreceptors.

<doc id="401152" wikidata="Q391343" url="?curid=401152" title="The Great McGinty">
<text>The Great McGinty is a 1940 American political satire comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges, starring Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff and featuring William Demarest and (in her final screen appearance) Muriel Angelus. It was Sturges&#x27;s first film as a director; he sold the story to Paramount Pictures for just $10 on condition he direct the film. Sturges received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

For the U.K. release, the film was retitled Down Went McGinty, alluding to the 1889 song.

==Plot==
Dan McGinty, a bartender in a banana republic, recounts his rise and fall to the bar&#x27;s dancing girl and a suicidal American customer, Tommy. The customer was a trusted bank employee who can no longer return to the United States and his family because he is wanted by the law after falling to temptation and stealing from the bank. McGinty is in a similar situation, but in his case it is due to &quot;one crazy minute&quot; of honesty rather than one of dishonesty. In a long flashback, he explains.

McGinty&#x27;s career begins when he is a tramp who, offered $2 to vote under a false name in a rigged mayoral election, does it thirty-seven times at different precincts. This impresses a local political boss, and although they sometimes almost come to blows with each other, McGinty becomes first one of the boss&#x27;s enforcers and then his political protégé. During a public campaign for political reform, the boss, who controls all the political parties in the city, decides to have McGinty elected mayor as a &quot;reform&quot; candidate. He says a credible candidate must be married - but McGinty has no one he wants to marry. His secretary then proposes a marriage of convenience, which he accepts. Elected mayor, he continues the political corruption established by the boss, rationalizing that the public still benefits from public works no matter who bribes their way into profiting from them. But then he and his more idealistic wife actually fall in love. He begins to take her views on public service seriously, but says he is not powerful enough to act against the boss in any case.

Five years later, the boss decides McGinty should be governor of the state, and McGinty is duly elected. Now McGinty feels he is powerful enough and on his inauguration day he tells the boss that they&#x27;re through with each other. The boss says that if he goes down then he&#x27;ll take McGinty with him by revealing his part in the corruption. He then becomes angry enough to fire a gun at McGinty inside the governor&#x27;s mansion, ensuring his prompt arrest.

McGinty and the boss find themselves in adjacent jail cells, from which the boss arranges an escape for them both. The flashback ends with McGinty providing for his wife and her children by telling her by phone about money he has hidden. We finally see that the former political boss is still his boss at the bar, and that they are still given to violent disagreements.

==Cast==

Cast notes:
* Credited as “McGinty and the Boss”, Donlevy and Tamiroff reprised their roles in Sturges&#x27;s 1944 comedy &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek,&quot; which takes place during McGinty&#x27;s term as governor.
* This was the first film directed by Preston Sturges, and in it he used many of the actors who became part of his unofficial &quot;stock company&quot;, a troupe of character actors within the studio system. Appearing in &quot;McGinty&quot; are: George Anderson, Jimmy Conlin, William Demarest, Byron Foulger, Harry Hayden, Esther Howard, Arthur Hoyt, George Melford, Charles R. Moore, Frank Moran, Emory Parnell, Victor Potel, Dewey Robinson, Harry Rosenthal and Robert Warwick.
* This was the third film written by Preston Sturges that William Demarest appeared in, after &quot;Diamond Jim&quot; (1935) and &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1937), and he would go on to do seven others (see note).
* Jo Ann Sayers was originally scheduled to play Catherine McGinty, and was borrowed from MGM, but she was not found to be satisfactory and was replaced.
* Tamiroff&#x27;s malaprop-laced performance inspired the cartoon character Boris Badenov, on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;. Sturges used Tamiroff&#x27;s character to skewer one of Hollywood&#x27;s hoariest practices when he repeatedly pleads, &quot;Don&#x27;t make me say everything twice, will you?&quot;
* Heydt had starred in the Broadway production of Sturges&#x27;s first big success, &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot; (1929).

==Production==
&quot;The Great McGinty&quot; had numerous working titles: &quot;The Story of a Man&quot;, &quot;The Vagrant&quot;, &quot;The Mantle of Dignity&quot;, &quot;The Biography of a Bum&quot;, and &quot;Down Went McGinty&quot;, (which was used for the film&#x27;s release in the U.K). Sturges had written the original story, &quot;The Story of a Man&quot;, in 1933 with Spencer Tracy in mind. According to film historian Kevin Brownlow, Sturges was inspired by the career of William Sulzer, who was impeached and removed from office as governor of New York.

After trying to sell the story to Universal in 1935, and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1938 under the title &quot;Biography of a Bum&quot;, Sturges finally sold it to Paramount on August 19, 1939, for $10 on the condition that he be allowed to direct it. Paramount agreed, and provided Sturges a budget of $350,000, a three-week shooting schedule, and inexpensive stars to work with.

Production on the film was delayed to allow Akim Tamiroff to do &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, but it began on December 15, 1939. Sturges contracted pneumonia during filming, and required a nurse to attend to him on the set. Production stopped on January 25, 1940, with one day&#x27;s shooting left to do, which was accomplished on April 15, after the first cut of the film had already been made.

==Release==
&quot;The Great McGinty&quot; premiered in New York City on August 15, 1940, and was generally released on August 23. The movie was not a large hit but was profitable.

It was released on video in the U.S. on April 7, 1988, and re-released on June 30, 1993.

==Adaptations==
Brian Donlevy appeared in a &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; radio adaptation January 23, 1942, on the CBS radio network, the August 27, 1945 episode of The Screen Guild Theater and in the April 20, 1946 episode of Academy Award Theater. It was also adapted to the October 12, 1947 episode of the Ford Theatre and a May 11, 1952 &quot;Screen Guild Theater&quot; starring Broderick Crawford. Donlevy also appeared in a television adaptation on &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, broadcast on 28 April 1955, with Thomas Gomez and Jesse White. The director was Earl Eby and Preston Sturges&#x27; screenplay was adapted by S.H. Barnett.

Paramount considered a remake of the film starring Bing Crosby in 1950, and one in 1954 with Bob Hope, but decided against both.

==Awards and honors==
Preston Sturges won the 1940 Academy Award for &quot;Best Original Screenplay&quot; for &quot;The Great McGinty&quot;, which was named as one of the &quot;10 Best Films of 1940&quot; by both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Film Daily&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** The Politician: &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for graft, you&#x27;d get a very low type of people in politics.&quot; – Nominated

<doc id="401154" wikidata="Q5089101" url="?curid=401154" title="Checked baggage">
<text>Checked baggage is luggage delivered to an airline or train for transportation in the hold of an aircraft, storage on a coach bus or baggage car of a passenger train. Checked baggage is inaccessible to the passenger during the flight or ride, as opposed to carry-on baggage.

This baggage is limited by airlines with regard to size, weight, and number, usually dependent upon the fare paid, or class of ticket. Baggage exceeding the limits is regarded as &quot;excess baggage&quot;.

==Checked baggage on airlines==

===Checked baggage policies===
Every airline has its own policies with regard to baggage allowance. Often the policy is also dependent on where the flight goes to or comes from. Tickets executed by multiple airlines may have different rules. Usually the exact conditions of a specific booking are mentioned in the ticket information online. 

On short-haul internal flights in the US and Canada, with some exceptions, checked baggage is no longer complimentary with most discounted economy tickets, and must be paid for in addition to the ticket price; a passenger generally has to hold a higher or full fare economy ticket, travel in a premium cabin, hold elite status on an airline, or an airline credit card to be afforded complimentary checked baggage. For long-haul and transoceanic flights, checked baggage is included as standard.

Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair in Europe and AirAsia in Asia charge for checked baggage, whilst for full-service airlines the cost is included in the ticket price.

===Passenger-baggage reconciliation===
According to the rules of most air transportation authorities, such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and European Union&#x27;s Joint Aviation Authorities, should passengers flying internationally with checked baggage fail to arrive at the departure gate before the flight is closed, that person&#x27;s baggage must be retrieved from the aircraft hold before the flight is permitted to take off. For Singapore, passengers with prohibited items are required to take it out from the bags retrieved at the check-in counter, failing which the baggage will be flagged with prohibited items and will be dumped away before boarding. In the United States, this does not apply to domestic flights since all bags are required to go through explosive detection machines (EDS) prior to loading. Making sure passengers board flights onto which they have checked baggage is called &quot;passenger-baggage reconciliation&quot; and is accomplished automatically through two commercially available systems. The security presumption of passenger-baggage reconciliation is that terrorists will not want to kill themselves, and will not board an aircraft if they have caused a bomb to be placed in its hold. This presumption does not hold true of suicide bombers.

Unaccompanied suitcases led to the downing of four flights, when a bomb inside the suitcase exploded:
*1983: Gulf Air Flight 771
*1985: Air India Flight 182
*1988: Pan Am Flight 103
*1989: UTA Flight 772

==Restrictions==
Spare lithium-ion batteries, inclusive of battery packs and powerbanks are not allowed on checked-in luggage.

==Excess baggage==
Excess baggage refers to the amount of baggage that is in excess of the free allowance in size, number, or weight permitted for the journey. At the carrier&#x27;s discretion, this may be carried at an extra charge, but no guarantee is made and it may have to be sent as freight instead. Some airlines impose excess baggage embargoes on certain (usually smaller) routes, indicating that they will accept no (or very little) excess baggage.

<text>Franco Andrea Bonelli (10 November 1784 – 18 November 1830) was an Italian ornithologist, entomologist and collector.

==Life==
Very little is known about the early life of Bonelli: he was born in Cuneo. He was interested from an early age in the fauna which surrounded him, making collecting trips, preparing specimens and noting his observations.

He became a member of the Reale Società Agraria di Torino in 1807 when he presented his first studies relating to the Coleoptera of Piedmont. The high quality of these studies attracted the interest of the naturalists of his time.

In April 1810, George Vat was sent to Turin by the French government to reorganize the University of Turin and begin its fusion with the Impériale University founded by Napoleon. Vat was very impressed by Bonelli&#x27;s knowledge. Vat encouraged him to further his knowledge by coming to follow courses at the Natural History Museum in Paris. 
Bonelli took this advice so as to obtain a professor&#x27;s chair in the new university. In September 1810, he arrived in Paris.

In 1811, Bonelli was finally named professor of zoology at the University of Turin and keeper of the Natural History Museum of Zoology. During his time at the university, he formed one of the largest ornithological collections in Europe.

In 1811, Bonelli wrote a &quot;Catalogue of the Birds of Piedmont&quot;, in which he described 262 species. In 1815, he discovered the bird Bonelli&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus bonelli&quot;), named by Louis Vieillot in 1819. In the same year, he discovered Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus fasciatus&quot;) which was likewise named by Vieillot in 1822.

The successor of Bonelli at the Turin Museum was Carlo Giuseppe Gené. His son was Cesare Bonelli Italian Minister of War from 1878-1880.

==Achievements==
Bonelli is most notable for his work on birds and on the beetle family Carabidae. Since he was an early worker on Coleoptera many of his genera later became Families, sub families and tribes. Also, many of his genera survive.

Instances are the:

*Omophroninae; Pseudomorphinae; Brachininae; Trechinae; Harpalinae; Pseudomorphinae; Siagoninae; Pterostichinae and Scaritinae - Subfamilies
*Dromiidae 1810 Family
* Pterostichini Tribe

==Works==

*&quot;Catalogue des Oiseaux du Piemont&quot; (1811).
*Observations Entomologique. Première partie. &quot;Mém. Acad. Sci. Turin&quot; 18: 21–78, Tabula Synoptica (1810).
*Observations entomologiques. Deuxieme partie. &quot;Mém. Acad. Sci. Turin&quot; 20: 433-484 (1813)

The last two are founding works of entomology, introducing many new taxa.

<text>The mountain finches are birds in the genus Leucosticte from the true finch family, Fringillidae. This genus also includes the rosy finches, named from their pinkish plumage.

The genus is a sister to the monotypic &quot;Procarduelis&quot; containing the Asian dark-breasted rosefinch. These birds are native to Asia and North America and are typically found in barren mountainous regions. Many species eat more insect material than other finches.

There are six species in the genus:

<text>Analyze is a software package developed by the Biomedical Imaging Resource (BIR) at Mayo Clinic for multi-dimensional display, processing, and measurement of multi-modality biomedical images. It is a commercial program and is used for medical tomographic scans from magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and positron emission tomography. 

The Analyze 7.5 file format has been widely used in the functional neuroimaging field, and other programs such as SPM, FreeSurfer, AIR, MRIcro and Mango are able to read and write the format. The files can be used to store voxel-based volumes. One data item consists of two files: One file with the actual data in a binary format with the filename extension codice_1 and another file (&quot;header&quot; with filename extension codice_2) with information about the data such as voxel size and number of voxels in each dimension. SPM has defined changes to this format, among other things the voxel ordering within the file.

<text>Explication () is the process of drawing out the meaning of something which is not clearly defined, so as to make explicit what is currently left implicit. The term &quot;explication&quot; is used in both analytic philosophy and literary criticism. Rudolf Carnap was the first to coin the term in an analytic philosophical approach in his book &quot;Logical Foundations of Probability&quot;, while the term is supplanted with Gustave Lanson’s idea of &quot;Explication de Texte&quot; when referring to the analysis and criticism of different forms of literature. 

== Carnap&#x27;s notion of explication ==

=== Summary ===

In analytic philosophy, the concept of explication was first developed by Rudolf Carnap. Explication can be regarded as a scientific process which transforms and replaces &quot;an inexact prescientific concept&quot; (which Carnap calls the explicandum), with a &quot;new exact concept&quot; (which he calls the explicatum). A description and explanation of the nature and impact of the new explicit knowledge is usually called an &quot;explication&quot;. The new explicit knowledge draws on, and is an improvement upon, previous knowledge.

=== On explication and truth ===

An explication in the Carnapian sense is purely stipulative, and thus a subclass of normative definitions. Hence, an explication can not be true or false, just more or less suitable for its purpose. (Cf. Rorty&#x27;s argument about the purpose and value of philosophy in Rorty (2003), &quot;A pragmatist view of contemporary analytic philosophy&quot;, in Egginton, W. and Sandbothe, M. (Eds), The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy, SUNY Press, New York, NY.)

Examples of inexact daily life concepts in need of explication are our concepts of cause and of conditionals. Our daily life concept of cause does not distinguish between necessary causes, sufficient causes, complete causes etc. Each of these more precise concepts is an explication of our natural concept of cause.

Natural language will only specify truth conditions for propositions of the form &quot;If p, then q&quot; for situations where &quot;p&quot; is true. (Most of us probably don&#x27;t have any clear intuitions regarding the truth conditions of the sentence &quot;If I go out in the sun, I will get sunburned&quot; in situations where I never go out in the sun.) An explication of the conditional will also specify truth conditions for situations where &quot;p&quot; is not true.

=== Reviews of Carnap&#x27;s argument ===
Carnap&#x27;s argument provides a helpful foundation in understanding and clarifying the nature and value of explication in defining and describing &quot;new&quot; knowledge.

Others&#x27; reviews of Carnap&#x27;s argument offer additional insights about the nature of explication. In particular, Bonolio&#x27;s paper (2003) &quot;Kant’s Explication and Carnap’s Explication: The Redde Rationem&quot;, and Maher&#x27;s (2007) &quot;Explication defended&quot;, add weight to the argument that explication is an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy.

== Use of the word &quot;explication&quot; ==
The word &quot;explicate&quot; is a verb referring to the process of explicating. The word &quot;explication&quot; is a noun referring to the outcome of that process: the explicative work itself. As conceptual clarity is an important element of analytic philosophy, it is important to use words according to their proper definitions so as to avoid causing unnecessary confusion.

== Semantic explication ==
In the natural semantic metalanguage theory, explications are semantic representations of vocabulary. These explications are made up of a very limited set of words called semantic primes which are considered to have universal meaning across all languages.

An example of an explication of the word &quot;happy&quot;&quot;:&quot;
X feels happy = 
 sometimes someone thinks something like this:
 something good happened to something
 I wanted this
 I don&#x27;t want other things now
 because of this, someone feels something good
 X feels like this
What sets the Natural Semantic Metalanguage Theory&#x27;s explications apart from previous theories, is that these explications can fit into natural language, even if it sounds very awkward. For example:
The clown looks [happy]

The clown looks like [the clown thinks something like this: &#x27;something good happened to me; I wanted this; I don&#x27;t want other things now&#x27;; because of this, the clown feels something good].
Explications in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage are neither exact dictionary definitions, nor encyclopedic explanations of a concept. They often differ slightly depending upon the personal experiences of the person writing them. In this way, they can be said to &quot;rely heavily on &#x27;folk theories,&#x27; that is, the rather naive understandings that most of us have about how life, the universe, and everything work.&quot; Explications of abstract concepts, such as color, do not list any scientific facts about the object or concrete definitions. Instead, the explications use comparisons and examples from the real world.

== Explication, &quot;explication de texte&quot;, and literary criticism ==

The terms &quot;explication&quot; and &quot;explication de texte&quot; have different meanings.

As argued by Carnap (1950), in science and philosophy, 
&quot;explication consists in transforming a given more or less inexact concept into an exact one or, rather, in replacing the first by the second. We call the given concept (or the term used for it) the explicandum, and the exact concept proposed to take the place of the first (or the term proposed for it) the explicatum. The explicandum may belong to everyday language or to a previous stage in the development of scientific language. The explicatum must be given by explicit rules for its use, for example, by a definition which incorporates it into a well-constructed system of scientific either logicomathematical or empirical concepts.&quot;

In this context, &#x27;explication&#x27; is now regarded as &quot;an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy&quot;. (Maher, 2007).

By contrast, in literary criticism, the term &#x27;explication&#x27; is used as a proxy for the term &quot;explication de texte&quot; (proposed by Gustave Lanson), where additional understandings and meanings are derived from the &quot;close reading&quot; of (say) a poem, novel or play.

In this process, explication often involves a line-by-line or episode-by-episode commentary on what is going on in a text. While initially this might seem reasonably innocuous, &quot;explication de texte&quot;, and explication per se, is an interpretative process where the resulting new knowledge, new insights or new meanings, are open to subsequent debate and disaffirmation by others.

<text>The Episcopal Church of Jerusalem and the Middle East is a province of the Anglican Communion. The primate of the church is called President Bishop and represents the Church at the international Anglican Communion Primates&#x27; Meetings. The Central Synod of the church is its deliberative and legislative organ.

The province consists of three dioceses:
* Diocese of Jerusalem — covering Israel, Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon,
* Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf — covering Cyprus, the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq,
* Diocese of Iran.

A fourth diocese (Egypt with North Africa and the Horn of Africa) was part of the province until June 2020. In 2019 the synod of the province had agreed to allow the Diocese of Egypt to withdraw, in order to become an autonomous province, with the other three existing dioceses remaining as the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. This was put into effect on 29 June 2020, with the creation of the Province of Alexandria.

Each diocese is headed by a bishop. The President Bishop (Primate, but not an Archbishop) is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and retains diocesan responsibility. The President Bishop, Hosam Naoum since 2023, also serves as Archbishop in Jerusalem. The province estimates that it has around 35,000 baptized members in 55 congregations. The province has around 40 educational or medical establishments and 90 clergy.

==History==
===Nineteenth century===

The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East began as a number of missionary posts of the Church Mission Society (CMS) in Cyprus, the Middle East and the Persia. The Church Mission Society continues to provide the province with lay mission partners and ordained chaplains, but now the majority of its ministry is drawn from local congregations.

During the 1820s, CMS began to prepare for permanent missionary stations in the region.

In 1833, a missionary station was established in Jerusalem with the support of the &quot;London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews&quot; (a Jewish Christian missionary society now known as the Church&#x27;s Ministry Among Jewish People or CMJ). In 1839, the building of the Church of Saint Mark, Alexandria was begun.

In 1841, Michael Solomon Alexander, a converted rabbi, arrived in Jerusalem as bishop. His diocese originally covered the mission stations in the Middle East and Egypt, and was a joint venture with the Evangelical Church in Prussia (the so-called &quot;Anglo-Prussian Union&quot;), serving Lutherans and Anglicans.

In 1849, Christ Church, Jerusalem, became the first Anglican church in Jerusalem.

In the 1860&#x27;s The Church of the Good Shepherd, Salt in modern Jordan had its origins in the work of a local Arab grain merchant and colporteur from Nablus who started bible studies under a tree. At the time Salt, Jordan was a major Ottoman regional city east of the river Jordan in the Levant.

In 1871, Christ Church, Nazareth was consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat, and the first Arab Anglicans were ordained.

In 1881, the Anglo-Prussian Union ceased to function, and it was formally dissolved in 1887. From that time, the diocese became solely Anglican.

In 1888, Bishop George Blyth founded the Jerusalem and the East Mission, which would help raise funds for missions throughout the Middle East.

Saint George&#x27;s Cathedral was built in 1898 in Jerusalem as a central focus for the diocese.

===Twentieth century===
Although the Diocese of Jerusalem and the Middle East began as a foreign missionary organisation, it quickly established itself as part of the local, especially Palestinian community. In 1905, the Palestinian Native Church Council was established to give Palestinians more say in the running of the church. This led to an increase in the number of Palestinian and Arab clergy serving the diocese.

In 1920, the Diocese of Egypt and the Sudan was formed, separate from the Diocese of Jerusalem, with Llewelyn Gwynne as its first bishop. In the 1920s the Bishop founded St. George&#x27;s College as a seminary for local clergy-in-training. Bishop Gwynne established the second cathedral of All Saints&#x27;, Cairo (the present cathedral is the third building) in 1938.

In 1945, Sudan became a separate diocese from Egypt (see Episcopal Church of the Sudan for its history).

In 1957, the See of Jerusalem was elevated to the rank of an archbishopric (its bishop being an archbishop) under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop in Jerusalem had metropolitan oversight of the entire area of the current province with the addition of the Sudan (five dioceses in all). In that same year, Najib Cubain was consecrated Bishop of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, the first Arab bishop, assistant to the Archbishop in Jerusalem. During the 1950s, political unrest in Egypt left the diocese in the care of four Egyptian clergy under the oversight of the Archbishop in Jerusalem. On 29 August 1974, Faik Haddad (to become coadjutor bishop in Jerusalem) and Aql Aql (to become Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) were consecrated bishops by Stopford at St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Jerusalem.

An Anglican Bishop of Egypt was appointed in 1968, and, in 1974, the first Egyptian bishop, Ishaq Musaad, was consecrated. In 1976, Faik Haddad became the first Palestinian Anglican bishop in Jerusalem.

In 1976, the structure of the Anglican church in the region was overhauled. Jerusalem became an ordinary bishopric and the four dioceses had equal status in the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. The Archbishop of Canterbury relinquished his metropolitan authority to a Presiding Bishop and the Central Synod, with the four dioceses rotating the responsibility of the Bishop President and synodical leadership. The central synod includes the four dioceses of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. In Jerusalem when a bishop reaches the age of 68 a coadjutor bishop should be elected to work alongside the bishop for two years. while the Bishops in Egypt and Iran are elected without working alongside the former bishop; and the Bishop of Cyprus and the Gulf was appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Due to the difficult situation in Iran since the 1970&#x27;s various Bishops or Vicars General have been appointed to serve in the position, often residing outside the country.

The Diocese of Egypt was expanded to take in the chaplaincies of Ethiopia, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. Sudan became a fully separate and independent province.

In 1970, the Cathedral of All Saints in Cairo was demolished to make way for a new Nile bridge. In 1977, work on a new building on Zamalek was begun, and completed in 1988.

In June 2020 the Diocese of Egypt left the province, split into four dioceses, and was formed into an autonomous province named the Episcopal/Anglican Province of Alexandria.

==President Bishops==
The President Bishops of the Central Synod have been:
*1977–1985: Hassan Dehqani-Tafti, Bishop in Iran

==Dioceses==
===Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf===
Diocesan seats are St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Nicosia, Cyprus and St Christopher&#x27;s Cathedral, Manama, Bahrain. The current bishop is Sean Semple.

The diocese is divided into two archdeaconries: one for Cyprus and one for the Persian Gulf area.

Countries served:
*Bahrain
*Cyprus
*Iraq
*Kuwait
*Oman
*Qatar
*Saudi Arabia
*United Arab Emirates
*Yemen

===Diocese of Iran===
The Diocese of Iran was first established in 1912 as the Diocese of Persia and was incorporated into the Jerusalem Archbishopric in 1957. Currently, there is an episcopal vacancy and the Vicar General is the Revd Albert Walters. The diocesan seat is St Luke&#x27;s Church, Isfahan, Iran.

===Diocese of Jerusalem===
The current Anglican Archbishop in Jerusalem is Hosam Naoum who was installed on May 13, 2021.

Effective from 2014, the Jerusalem diocese has again become an archbishopric, with its bishop styled &quot;Archbishop in Jerusalem&quot;. This title applies regardless of whether the current bishop is the primate of the province or not, and is a mark of the ambassadorial role of the archbishop in the Holy Land on behalf of the Anglican Communion.

The Diocese of Jerusalem covers Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

The diocesan seat is Cathedral Church of St George the Martyr, Jerusalem.

The parish with the largest congregation is the Church of the Redeemer, Amman, Jordan. The cornerstone of the church was laid in 1949, and the church houses both Arabic and English-speaking congregations today.

==Anglican realignment==
President Bishop Mouneer Anis was the Chairman of the Global South and one of the seven Anglican archbishops present at the investiture of Foley Beach as the second Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America at 9 October 2014. The seven Primates signed a statement recognizing Beach as a &quot;fellow Primate of the Anglican Communion&quot;. The province was represented at GAFCON III, in Jerusalem, on 17–22 June 2018, by a 13 members delegation, from Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. 

In 2022, Michael Lewis, then Archbishop of the Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf, signed a letter during the Lambeth Conference supporting the full inclusion of LGBTQ people in the Anglican Communion.

<text>A platform-specific model is a model of a software or business system that is linked to a specific technological platform (e.g. a specific programming language, operating system, document file format or database). Platform-specific models are indispensable for the actual implementation of a system.

For example, if a business needs to implement an online shop, then their software system will need to store different kinds of information: available goods, user info such as credit cards, etc. The designer might decide to use for this purpose an Oracle database. For this to work, the designer will need to express concepts (e.g. the concept of a user) in a relational model using the Oracle&#x27;s SQL dialect. This Oracle&#x27;s specific relational model is an example of a &quot;Platform-specific model&quot;.

In Model-driven architecture, a platform-specific model is where the design of the model is constructed with the intended execution-platform driving design choices.

<text>Gustav Ferdinand Richard Radde (27 November 1831 – 16 March 1903) was a German naturalist and Siberian explorer. Radde&#x27;s warbler and several other species are named after him.

==Biography==

Radde was born in Danzig, the son of a schoolmaster. He had little formal education, and began a career as an apothecary. At an early age he was influenced by Anton Menge and became increasingly interested in natural history, and in 1852 he gave up his career and spent two years in the Crimea with the botanist Christian von Steven, collecting both plants and animals. He made further trips to southern Russia with Johann Friedrich von Brandt and Karl Ernst von Baer. He was botanist and zoologist on the East Siberian Expedition of 1855, led by the astronomer Ludwig Schwarz.

In 1864 he eventually settled in Tbilisi. In the same year he explored the region surrounding Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain in the Western Palearctic. As well as collecting many plants he recorded the languages, ballads and customs of the local tribes. He set up a museum (the Caucasus Museum) and library in Tbilisi to exhibit his discoveries. His collecting expeditions included visits along the Black Sea coast and eastwards beyond the Caspian Sea to Askhabad. In 1895 he sailed to India and Japan with the Grand Duke Michael, and two years later he was official naturalist on a visit by members of the Russian imperial family to North Africa. He eventually became a member of the Council of State in Tbilisi.

In 1884 he was honoured with the chairmanship of the first International Ornithological Congress in Vienna. He was also an honorary member of the &quot;Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft&quot;, and a foreign member of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union and the Zoological Society of London. He was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1889 and the Constantine Medal of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in 1898.

==Eponyms==
Animals named after him include birds such as Radde&#x27;s warbler and Radde&#x27;s accentor, and amphibians and reptiles such as the Mongolian toad (&quot;Pseudepidalea raddei)&quot;, the Azerbaijan lizard (&quot;Darevskia raddei)&quot;, a toadhead agama (&quot;Phrynocephalus raddei)&quot;, and Radde&#x27;s mountain viper (&quot;Montivipera raddei)&quot;. He is also remembered in the names of Radde&#x27;s vole (&quot;Stenocranius raddei&quot;), the Ciscaucasian hamster (&quot;Mesocricetus raddei&quot;), and Radde&#x27;s shrew (&quot;Sorex raddei&quot;).

==Collections==
Radde was an avid entomologist. His insect (and other) collections are divided: Transbaikal and Amur material is in the Zoological Museum of the Russian Academy of Science; Caucasus and Transcaspian material is in the Georgian National Museum Zoological Section, Tbilisi.

This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Radde when citing a botanical name.

==Works==
His publications include:
* &quot;Reisen im Süden von Ost-Sibirien in den Jahren 1855-59&quot; (“Travels in the south of eastern Siberia during the years 1855-59,” 1862–1863)
* &quot;Vier Vorträge über den Kaukasus&quot; (“Four essays on the Caucasus,” 1874) 
* &quot;Die Chews&#x27;uren und ihr Land&quot; (“The Chews&#x27;uren and their land,” 1878)
* &quot;Ornis Caucasica. Die Vogelwelt des Kaukasus&quot; (“Ornis Caucasica. The world of birds in the Caucasus,” 1884) at archive.org
* &quot;Das Ostufer des Pontus&quot; (“The east bank of the Pontus,” 1894)
* &quot;Die Sammlungen des kaukasischen Museums&quot; (“The collections of the Caucasus Museum,” 1900 et seq.)
In 1892, he wrote a Russian description of his voyage with the grand dukes Alexander and Sergeis Mikhailovitch.

<text>Model-driven architecture (MDA) is a software design approach for the development of software systems. It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as models. Model Driven Architecture is a kind of domain engineering, and supports model-driven engineering of software systems. It was launched by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 2001.

== Overview ==
Model Driven Architecture® (MDA®) &quot;provides an approach for deriving value from models and architecture in support of the full life cycle of physical, organizational and I.T. systems&quot;. A model is a (representation of) an abstraction of a system. MDA® provides value by producing models at varying levels of abstraction, from a conceptual view down to the smallest implementation detail. OMG literature speaks of three such levels of abstraction, or architectural viewpoints: the Computation-independent Model (CIM), the Platform-independent model (PIM), and the Platform-specific model (PSM). The CIM describes a system conceptually, the PIM describes the computational aspects of a system without reference to the technologies that may be used to implement it, and the PSM provides the technical details necessary to implement the system. The OMG Guide notes, though, that these three architectural viewpoints are useful, but are just three of many possible viewpoints.

The OMG organization provides specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Implementations come from private companies or open source groups.

=== Related standards ===
The MDA model is related to multiple standards, including the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the Meta-Object Facility (MOF), XML Metadata Interchange (XMI), Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC), the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM), and the Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM). Note that the term “architecture” in Model Driven Architecture does not refer to the architecture of the system being modeled, but rather to the architecture of the various standards and model forms that serve as the technology basis for MDA.

Executable UML was the UML profile used when MDA was born. Now, the OMG is promoting fUML, instead. (The action language for fUML is ALF.)

=== Trademark ===
The Object Management Group holds registered trademarks on the term Model Driven Architecture and its acronym MDA, as well as trademarks for terms such as: Model Based Application Development, Model Driven Application Development, Model Based Application Development, Model Based Programming, Model Driven Systems, and others.

== Model Driven Architecture topics ==
=== MDA approach ===
OMG focuses Model Driven Architecture® on forward engineering, i.e. producing code from abstract, human-elaborated modeling diagrams (e.g. class diagrams). OMG&#x27;s ADTF (Analysis and Design Task Force) group leads this effort. With some humour, the group chose ADM (MDA backwards) to name the study of reverse engineering. ADM decodes to Architecture-Driven Modernization. The objective of ADM is to produce standards for model-based reverse engineering of legacy systems. Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) is the furthest along of these efforts, and describes information systems in terms of various assets (programs, specifications, data, test files, database schemas, etc.).

As the concepts and technologies used to realize designs and the concepts and technologies used to realize architectures have changed at their own pace, decoupling them allows system developers to choose from the best and most fitting in both domains. The design addresses the functional (use case) requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through which non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability and performance are realized. MDA envisages that the platform independent model (PIM), which represents a conceptual design realizing the functional requirements, will survive changes in realization technologies and software architectures.

Of particular importance to Model Driven Architecture is the notion of model transformation. A specific standard language for model transformation has been defined by OMG called QVT.

=== MDA tools ===
The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). The OMG documents the overall process in a document called the MDA Guide.

Basically, an MDA tool is a tool used to develop, interpret, compare, align, measure, verify, transform, etc. models or metamodels. In the following section &quot;model&quot; is interpreted as meaning any kind of model (e.g. a UML model) or metamodel (e.g. the CWM metamodel). In any MDA approach we have essentially two kinds of models: &quot;initial models&quot; are created manually by human agents while &quot;derived models&quot; are created automatically by programs. For example, an analyst may create a UML initial model from its observation of some loose business situation while a Java model may be automatically derived from this UML model by a Model transformation operation.

An MDA tool may be a tool used to check models for completeness, inconsistencies, or error and warning conditions.

Some tools perform more than one of the functions listed above. For example, some creation tools may also have transformation and test capabilities. There are other tools that are solely for creation, solely for graphical presentation, solely for transformation, etc.

Implementations of the OMG specifications come from private companies or open source groups. One important source of implementations for OMG specifications is the Eclipse Foundation (EF). Many implementations of OMG modeling standards may be found in the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) or Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF), the Eclipse foundation is also developing other tools of various profiles as GMT. Eclipse&#x27;s compliance to OMG specifications is often not strict. This is true for example for OMG&#x27;s EMOF standard, which EMF approximates with its Ecore implementation. More examples may be found in the M2M project implementing the QVT standard or in the M2T project implementing the MOF2Text standard.

One should be careful not to confuse the &quot;List of MDA Tools&quot; and the List of UML tools, the former being much broader. This distinction can be made more general by distinguishing &#x27;variable metamodel tools&#x27; and &#x27;fixed metamodel tools&#x27;. A UML CASE tool is typically a &#x27;fixed metamodel tool&#x27; since it has been hard-wired to work only with a given version of the UML metamodel (e.g. UML 2.1). On the contrary, other tools have internal generic capabilities allowing them to adapt to arbitrary metamodels or to a particular kind of metamodels.

Usually MDA tools focus rudimentary architecture specification, although in some cases the tools are architecture-independent (or platform independent).

Simple examples of architecture specifications include:
* Selecting one of a number of supported reference architectures like Java EE or Microsoft .NET,
* Specifying the architecture at a finer level including the choice of presentation layer technology, business logic layer technology, persistence technology and persistence mapping technology (e.g. object-relational mapper).
* Metadata: information about data.

=== MDA concerns ===
Some key concepts that underpin the MDA approach (launched in 2001) were first elucidated by the Shlaer–Mellor method during the late 1980s. Indeed, a key absent technical standard of the MDA approach (that of an action language syntax for Executable UML) has been bridged by some vendors by adapting the original Shlaer–Mellor Action Language (modified for UML). However, during this period the MDA approach has not gained mainstream industry acceptance; with the Gartner Group still identifying MDA as an &quot;on the rise&quot; technology in its 2006 &quot;Hype Cycle&quot;, and Forrester Research declaring MDA to be &quot;D.O.A.&quot; in 2006. Potential concerns that have been raised with the OMG MDA approach include:
* Incomplete Standards: The MDA approach is underpinned by a variety of technical standards, some of which are yet to be specified (e.g. an action semantic language for xtUML), or are yet to be implemented in a standard manner (e.g. a QVT transformation engine or a PIM with a virtual execution environment).
* Vendor Lock-in: Although MDA was conceived as an approach for achieving (technical) platform independence, current MDA vendors have been reluctant to engineer their MDA toolsets to be interoperable. Such an outcome could result in vendor lock-in for those pursuing an MDA approach.
* Idealistic: MDA is conceived as a forward engineering approach in which models that incorporate Action Language programming are transformed into implementation artifacts (e.g. executable code, database schema) in one direction via a fully or partially automated &quot;generation&quot; step. This aligns with OMG&#x27;s vision that MDA should allow modelling of a problem domain&#x27;s full complexity in UML (and related standards) with subsequent transformation to a complete (executable) application. This approach does, however, imply that changes to implementation artifacts (e.g. database schema tuning) are not supported . This constitutes a problem in situations where such post-transformation &quot;adapting&quot; of implementation artifacts is seen to be necessary. Evidence that the full MDA approach may be too idealistic for some real world deployments has been seen in the rise of so-called &quot;pragmatic MDA&quot;. Pragmatic MDA blends the literal standards from OMG&#x27;s MDA with more traditional model driven approaches such as round-trip engineering that provides support for adapting implementation artifacts (though not without substantial disadvantages).
* Specialised Skillsets: Practitioners of MDA based software engineering are (as with other toolsets) required to have a high level of expertise in their field. Current expert MDA practitioners (often referred to as Modeller/Architects) are scarce relative to the availability of traditional developers.
* OMG Track Record: The OMG consortium who sponsor the MDA approach (and own the MDA trademark) also introduced and sponsored the CORBA standard which itself failed to materialise as a widely utilised standard.
* Uncertain Value Proposition (UVP): As discussed, the vision of MDA allows for the specification of a system as an abstract model, which may be realized as a concrete implementation (program) for a particular computing platform (e.g. .NET). Thus an application that has been successfully developed via a pure MDA approach could theoretically be ported to a newer release .NET platform (or even a Java platform) in a deterministic manner – although significant questions remain as to real-world practicalities during translation (such as user interface implementation). Whether this capability represents a significant value proposition remains a question for particular adopters. Regardless, adopters of MDA who are seeking value via an &quot;alternative to programming&quot; should be very careful when assessing this approach. The complexity of any given problem domain will always remain, and the programming of business logic needs to be undertaken in MDA as with any other approach. The difference with MDA is that the programming language used (e.g. xtUML) is more abstract (than, say, Java or C#) and exists interwoven with traditional UML artifacts (e.g. class diagrams). Whether programming in a language that is more abstract than mainstream 3GL languages will result in systems of better quality, cheaper cost or faster delivery, is a question that has yet to be adequately answered.
* MDA was recognized as a possible way to bring various independently developed standardized solutions together. For the simulation community, it was recommended as a business and industry based alternative to yet another US DoD mandated standard.

<text>Blas Fajardo Ople (February 3, 1927 – December 14, 2003) was a Filipino journalist and politician who held several high-ranking positions in the executive and legislative branches of the Philippine government, including as Senate President from 1999 to 2000, and as Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2002 until his death. Perceived as a leftist-nationalist at the onset of his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Ople&#x27;s most enduring role was his nineteen years as Secretary (later Minister) of Labor and Employment during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, when Philippine labor laws were overhauled through the enactment of the Labor Code of the Philippines that he had helped author.

==Early life and career==
Ople was born in Hagonoy, Bulacan on February 3, 1927, to Felix Antonio Ople, a craftsman who repaired boats, and his wife Segundina Fajardo. He graduated valedictorian of his grade school class at the Hagonoy Elementary School in 1941. Upon the invasion of the Philippines by Japan during World War II, he also had been to Hagonoy Institute during his secondary schooling, the teenage Ople joined the guerilla movement and fought under the Del Pilar Regiment and the Buenavista Regiment of the Bulacan Military Area founded by Alejo Santos.

In 1948, he finished his high school studies at the Far Eastern University High School in Manila. He worked towards a degree in liberal arts at the Educational Center of Asia (formerly Quezon College) in Manila. After graduation, Ople pursued a career in journalism. He became a desk editor at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the author of its &quot;Jeepney Tales&quot; column. Still in his twenties, Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists of that era. Ople also established a public relations consulting firm.

He soon became known for his nationalist views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s. In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay, heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party. After Magsaysay&#x27;s election, he joined the government as special assistant to the Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs.

==Secretary of Labor==
In 1965, Ople was appointed as Social Security Commissioner by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. In 1967, he was appointed Secretary of Labor and Employment (in 1978 the position was renamed Minister of Labor and Employment). He resigned briefly in 1971 to run an unsuccessful campaign for election to the Philippine Senate, but was re-appointed to his post in 1972, retaining the position until 1986. At the time of his appointment, Ka Blas was perceived as a &quot;leftist Nationalist&quot;. His leftist credentials were enhanced when he co-founded, in 1972, the &quot;Philippine-Soviet Friendship Society&quot;.

As Labor Secretary, Ka Blas was instrumental in the framing of the Labor Code of the Philippines, which codified the labor laws of the country and introduced innovations such as prohibiting the termination of workers without legal cause. Ople instituted labor policies institutionalizing the technical education of workers. In 1976, Ople initiated a program for the overseas employment of Filipino workers. It was during his tenure at Labor that the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration were created. Ople obtained recognition from the International Labour Organization during his stint as Labor Minister. In 1975, he was elected president of the 60th International Labour Conference of the ILO, the first Filipino to hold that post. In 1983, that organization awarded Ople a Gold Medal of Appreciation. He was a close adviser of President Marcos, though he was not later to be associated with the corruption of the Marcos&#x27; government and was perceived as &quot;not corrupt&quot;. He created international headlines in December 1984 when he admitted to the press that the lupus-stricken Marcos was incapacitated to the point of being unable &quot;to take major initiatives&quot;, and that the President&#x27;s illness had placed the Philippines in &quot;a kind of interregnum&quot;. Marcos responded a few days later by baring his chest to his Cabinet before television cameras to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill or had undergone surgery.
In 1978, Ople was elected an assemblyman of the Interim Batasang Pambansa representing Central Luzon, and reelected in 1984. During the 1986 presidential elections, Ople served as a political campaign manager of President Marcos, who was running against Corazon Aquino. Shortly before the outbreak of the 1986 People Power Revolution, Marcos dispatched Ople to Washington, D.C. to lobby the American government on behalf of the President. Ople was in Washington D.C. upon the outbreak of the revolt, and was advised by U.S. Secretary of State, George P. Shultz, to call on Marcos to resign. Ople publicly reiterated his support for Marcos in the American media in such fora as on &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot;.

==1986 Constitutional Commission Member==
Following the success of the People Power Revolution and the installation to the presidency of Corazon Aquino, Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post. Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself as the leader of the political opposition against Aquino. Nonetheless in May 1986, Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution.

In the 1987 congressional elections, Ople ran a second time for the Philippine Senate, under the banner of the Grand Alliance for Democracy coalition. He was defeated in this attempt, and returned to private life, serving as chairman of the Institute for Public Policy (IPP), a policy research institute.

==Senator of the Philippines==

In 1992, he ran again for the Senate under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino. He was elected to a six-year term. In the Senate, Ople served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Commission of Appointments. He became Senate President Pro-Tempore in 1998.

Ople won a re-election for the senate in 1998, under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino.
In 1999, upon the resignation of the terminally-ill Marcelo Fernan, Ople became the President of the Senate. In that capacity, he was a key proponent of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and the United States, which allowed American forces to enter the Philippines for short-term training exercises. He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to Franklin Drilon.

Later that year, he sat as one of the senator-judges in the impeachment trial of his ally, President Joseph Estrada. He was one of the eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada. Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to the presidency.

==Secretary of Foreign Affairs==
In July 2002, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo appointed Ople, a member of the political opposition in the Senate, as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in her cabinet. The appointment was with some controversy. Weeks earlier, Arroyo&#x27;s hand-picked Vice-President Teofisto Guingona had resigned as Foreign Affairs Secretary after voicing disagreement with the plan of the Philippine and United States governments to allow American troops to help combat Islamic terrorist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf as part of the post-9/11 &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Ople, who had earlier been a vocal supporter of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, was perceived to be more amenable to the plan. In addition, left-wing labor activists denounced the appointment of Ople, citing his Marcos-era role in promoting overseas employment of Filipino workers which, they said, had resulted in abuses inflicted on Filipino workers abroad.

During his stint as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Ople was at the forefront of the negotiations that led to the deployment of American military forces inside the Philippines, though he insisted that the American troops would not participate in combat missions. Under his watch, the American and Filipino governments signed an agreement that provided immunity to each other&#x27;s citizens facing charges before international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court. Ople was also a vocal supporter of the Iraq War, and pushed for the deployment of a small Filipino contingent in Iraq. He predicted in November 2003, &quot;Baghdad will be transformed from a symbol of brutal despotism to a new, shining symbol of human freedom. The sacrifices invested in the liberation of Iraq, to which Filipinos made a significant contribution, will be fully vindicated and cherished for all time.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
In the months prior to his death, Ople, a longtime chain smoker, had suffered from ill health and often attended international conferences in a wheelchair. On the night of December 13, 2003, Ople had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness while aboard a Japan Asia Airways flight from Bangkok to Tokyo. The flight was diverted to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan County, Taiwan (now Taoyuan City), and Ople was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was initially pronounced dead on arrival, but given medical treatment nonetheless. Efforts to revive him were futile, and his death on Sunday, December 14, 2003, was announced by his family.

President Arroyo mourned Ople as &quot;an architect of Philippine foreign policy in the finest tradition of enlightened and pragmatic diplomacy&quot;, while U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell hailed him as &quot;one of the pivotal figures of the late Twentieth Century for Philippine history&quot;. More critical of Ople, Teddy Casiño, secretary-general of the leftist coalition BAYAN, called him a &quot;political chameleon&quot; who &quot;tried to pass himself off as a nationalist but [was] most pro-American&quot;. Nonetheless, Casiño acknowledged that Ople was &quot;a consistent, brilliant and very astute politician&quot;.

Ople was eulogized in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which recalled his erudition, his skill at political survival, and his trademark &quot;extraordinary baritone&quot;. The eulogy also said that at the height of the People Power Revolution, Ople in Washington, D.C. had reported to Marcos in Manila that the President&#x27;s support within the Reagan administration was falling. Marcos responded by asking Ople to reach out to his contacts in the Soviet government. Ople rebuffed Marcos, and as &quot;Time&quot; noted, declined &quot;to help make the Philippines a Soviet colony three years before the Berlin Wall fell&quot;.

Ople is buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. In 2004, President Arroyo named Ople&#x27;s daughter, Susan Ople, as Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment.

The building housing the former Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and currently the Department of Migrant Workers at the corner of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue in Mandaluyong was renamed Blas F. Ople Building in his honor on February 4, 2004.

<doc id="401175" wikidata="Q1799621" url="?curid=401175" title="Team Fortress Classic">
<text>Team Fortress Classic is a first-person shooter game developed by Valve and published by Sierra Studios. It was originally released in April 1999 for Windows, and is based on &quot;Team Fortress&quot;, a mod for the 1996 game &quot;Quake&quot;. The game puts two teams against each other in online multiplayer matches; each member plays as one of nine classes, each with different skills. The scenarios include capture the flag, territorial control, and escorting a &quot;VIP&quot; player.

Valve hired the developers of the &quot;Team Fortress&quot; mod to develop &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; using its GoldSrc engine (used in their 1998 game &quot;Half-Life&quot;) to promote the &quot;Half-Life&quot; software development kit. It received generally positive reviews, although the graphics were a point for criticism. In 2000, Valve released a standalone version, Team Fortress 1.5, with new character models, maps and other features. &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; was released in 2007.

==Gameplay==

Matches in &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; typically feature two teams, one red and one blue, and nine playable character classes. Each character class has a set of weapons and abilities unique to that specific class. This differentiation between classes makes for rock-paper-scissors-esque gameplay that requires teammates to work together in order to effectively achieve the objective. The class-system also encourages players to vary their selection of classes and utilize certain classes in conjunction with one another to gain the advantage.

In &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;, a server can hold up to 32 players simultaneously, and matches can be played in a number of game modes, each featuring different objectives.

===Classes===
In &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;, the player can choose to play as one of nine classes: the Scout, Sniper, Soldier, Demoman, Medic, Heavy Weapons Guy, Pyro, Spy, or Engineer. Each class comes equipped with at least one weapon unique to that class, and often a secondary weapon which may be common across multiple classes (typically a shotgun or nailgun). Additionally, each class gets a melee weapon (all classes, with the exception of the Medic, Spy, and Engineer, wield a crowbar, an homage to Valve&#x27;s game &quot;Half-Life&quot;). Finally, each player carries grenades; the effects of grenades vary, depending on the player&#x27;s class.

In Escort game modes, a player may also choose to play as the Civilian class, which is armed only with an umbrella, no armor, and very little health. Civilians are typically escorted and protected by the rest of the team.

* The Scout is the fastest class in the game, but is unable to deal much damage in return. The Scout is armed with a nailgun and shotgun as well as being able to use caltrops and concussion grenades to slow down and confuse opponents. He can also disarm the Demoman&#x27;s detonation pack, reveal enemy Spies by running close by fellow players as well as instantly locate the flags on any capture-the-flag map.
* The Sniper class is armed with a high-powered sniper rifle, and can be used to attack enemies from distant positions. 
* The Soldier class is significantly slower than Snipers and Scouts, but possesses better armor and is armed with a rocket launcher that allows him to rocket jump, along with combat shotguns as sidearms for backup. Rocket jumping, while effective for moving about the battlefield, also significantly damages the soldier. Soldiers can also make use of nail bombs to cause more damage within close quarters. 
* The Demoman class is armed with a grenade launcher for indirect fire onto enemy positions, and a Pipe Bomb launcher for booby-trapping places as well as being equipped with a demolition pack capable of opening or closing certain routes on some levels.
* The Medic class is equipped with a super nail gun, concussion grenades and a medical kit that can be used either to heal teammates or expose opponents to a contagious infection that drains health. 
* The Heavy Weapons class is armed with a powerful minigun, and can sustain more damage than any other class. However, the Heavy is significantly slower than the other classes.
* The Pyro class is equipped with a flamethrower and an incendiary rocket launcher, both of which can set enemies on fire. Pyros also carry several napalm grenades for the same purpose. 
* The Spy class differs significantly in style from other classes, as he can disguise himself to look like any other class on either side. The Spy is equipped with a knife to kill enemy players in one hit by stabbing them in the back, a tranquilizer gun to slow down opponents and a hallucination grenade which spouts gas to confuse them. Spies also possess the ability to feign death, allowing them to use their backstab ability more effectively.
* The Engineer class builds structures to support their team, such as sentry guns to defend key points, ammunition dispensers and teleporters. Engineers have the ability to replenish a teammate&#x27;s armor by tapping them with their wrench. In addition, the Engineer is armed with EMP grenades that detonates any explosive ammunition within its range, as well as a shotgun for backup.

==Development==
&quot;Team Fortress&quot; was originally a modification for &quot;Quake&quot; (1996), and then later for &quot;QuakeWorld&quot;, developed by TF Software Pty. Ltd. Its developers were working on a standalone sequel when they were hired by Valve to create a port of &quot;Team Fortress&quot; as a mod for Valve&#x27;s game &quot;Half-Life&quot;. After several delays from the original release date of March 26, 1999, the mod was released on April 7, 1999.

On June 9, 2000, &quot;Team Fortress&quot; version 1.5 was released as a part of &quot;Half-Life&quot; 1.1 update. It was the first standalone version of &quot;Team Fortress&quot;. The update added &quot;new sounds and weapons, enhanced graphics, new models for classes and weapons, new maps from popular mapmakers, an updated user interface that makes finding and joining games easy and intuitive, and a new in-game Command Menu Interface&quot;. It also included a new in-game interface and the networking code for Valve&#x27;s then-upcoming &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;. There were three new maps with the update: Dustbowl, Warpath, and Epicenter. Additionally, the new Command Menu Interface was an in-game menu that allowed players to execute commands to change teams, call for a medic and change classes while in a match.

Valve significantly updated &quot;Team Fortress&quot; over time, tweaking the game&#x27;s networking code, and adding new maps and game modes. In 2003, &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; was released on Valve&#x27;s Steam system. Versions for OS X and Linux were released in 2013.

== Reception ==
&quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; received positive reviews, garnering a rating of 85% on the video game review aggregator site GameRankings. There were some criticisms, however, like Graham Smith of &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; who criticized the game for being &quot;like &quot;Counter Strike&quot; only messy and gruff.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; the best multiplayer game of 1999, and wrote that it was &quot;more fun and more addictive than any other multiplayer-only title released in 1999, and didn&#x27;t cost owners of &quot;Half-Life&quot; a single penny&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; praised the multiple character classes, &quot;sophisticated game-tactics&quot;, and drive to work together with your team, but criticized the &quot;clunky&quot; team communication and graphics. In 2010, the game was included in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Following the success of &quot;Team Fortress&quot; as a &quot;Quake&quot; modification, Team Fortress Software began development of a sequel. Interested in the project&#x27;s potential, Valve hired the team to develop &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; on the modified &quot;Quake&quot; engine used by &quot;Half-Life&quot;. The partnership was announced in 1998, developed in parallel to &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;. However, the game was not shown publicly until a year later at E3 1999. Introduced as &quot;Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms&quot;, the game showcased multiple unprecedented technologies for its time and won several awards including &quot;Best Online Game&quot; and &quot;Best Action Game&quot;. In June 2000, Valve announced that &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; had been delayed further, attributing this to their rebuilding of the game on a new, proprietary in-house engine that is today known as the Source engine.

Following this delay, little mention of the game was made by Valve for a period of six years. Running up to &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;&#x27;s release in 2004, Valve&#x27;s Doug Lombardi said &quot;Team Fortress 2 &quot;was still being developed and news of its release would come after that of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. In 2006, during Electronic Arts&#x27; 2006 Summer Showcase, the game was shown publicly, with an art style that contrasted its initial design. In 2007, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; was released to acclaim as part of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;.

The plot and characters of &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; were expanded upon outside of the game in the form of short videos or comics. In April 2014, the &quot;Team Fortress&quot; comic series reintroduced the &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; classes (excluding their respective Medic) as a rival cast of characters to the &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; team. A catch-up comic released on the TF2 website released for free comic book day described &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; as being set in an alternate 1930, and that the game takes place during the Gravel Wars era of the timeline, along with the fact that the &quot;Classic&quot; engineer is the father of the engineer in &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;.

Fans created a mod for &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, &quot;Fortress Forever&quot;, aiming to replicate the gameplay of &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; while using the more modern Source engine. Fans have also made a similar mod of &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; titled &quot;Team Fortress 2 Classic&quot;, which seeks to marry gameplay elements and concepts from both entries alongside scrapped ideas from the sequel&#x27;s development cycle and several entirely original additions.

<text>Cheung Sha () is a rural area on the south coast of Lantau Island, New Territories, Hong Kong. Along the South Lantau Road, Cheung Sha is located between Tong Fuk (to the southwest) and San Shek Wan (to the northeast).

The most notable feature of the area is the Cheung Sha Beach, the longest beach in Hong Kong.

==History==
The South Lantau Road, passing through Cheung Sha, was built in the mid-20th century from Silver Mine Bay to Shek Pik for access to the new reservoir there.

==Features==
Cheung Sha is rural in character and largely undeveloped.

It is home to two small villages, namely Cheung Sha Ha Tsuen () and Cheung Sha Sheung Tsuen (). There are also a few low-density private housing developments. Cheung Sha Lower Village and Cheung Sha Upper Village are recognized villages under the New Territories Small House Policy.

The Cheung Sha Beach () is the longest beach in Hong Kong. It actually comprises two beaches separated by a rocky outcropping: Lower Cheung Sha Beach () and Upper Cheung Sha Beach (). On its own, Upper Cheung Sha Beach is still the longest beach in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong Government has holiday bungalows for government employees at Cheung Sha.

==Proposed development==

In January 2016, the Lantau Development Advisory Committee (LanDAC) proposed to build spas, resort hotels, and a &quot;wedding centre&quot; at Cheung Sha. The suggestion was part of a wider proposal to undertake major development of Lantau Island, increasing its population from approximately 100,000 to one million.

The proposals were positively received by the government, but decried by various advocacy groups as destructive urban sprawl reliant on more &quot;white elephant&quot; infrastructure projects.

<doc id="401188" wikidata="Q433483" url="?curid=401188" title="Stefan Themerson">
<text>Stefan Themerson (25 January 1910 – 6 September 1988) was a Polish writer of children&#x27;s literature, poet and inventor of Semantic Poetry, novelist, script writer filmmaker, composer and philosopher. He wrote in at least three languages. With his wife, Franciszka Themerson, they are regarded as leading husband-and-wife exponents of European Surrealism and publishers.

==Early life==

Stefan Themerson was born on 25 January 1910 in Płock, in what was then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire, and died in London on 6 September 1988.

His father, Mieczysław Themerson, was a physician, social reformer and aspiring writer (some of his work was published). His mother was Ludwika Smulewicz. During the First World War Dr. Themerson served as a medical officer in the Tsar&#x27;s army and the family lived in Riga, St. Petersburg and Velikiye Luki. In 1918 they returned to Płock, in an independent Poland, where Stefan attended the Władysław Jagiełło Gymnasium. During this time he first showed an interest in photography and also built a radio receiver. Stefan&#x27;s older brother, Roman, also qualified as a doctor, but died of spinal tuberculosis in 1929.

In 1928 Themerson went to Warsaw University to study physics. After a year, he transferred to the Warsaw Polytechnic to take up architecture, but spent most of his time working on photography, collage and film-making. His first published piece of writing was also in 1928. He never formally left his studies but gradually withdrew to follow his other interests. Themerson met the art student Franciszka Weinles, in 1929. She graduated with distinction in 1931 and they married the same year in Warsaw.

==1931 to 1935==
During these years the Themersons lived and worked in Warsaw. Stefan contributed articles to various periodicals and prose and verse to school textbooks and wrote at least ten books for children which Franciszka illustrated. &quot;Pan Tom Buduje Dom&quot;, &quot;Mr Rouse Builds His House&quot; is still in print in Poland. Stefan also experimented with photograms and the two of them made five short experimental films &quot;Apteka&quot; (&quot;The Pharmacy&quot;) (1930), &quot;Europa&quot; (1931–1932), &quot;Drobiazg Melodyjny&quot; (&quot;Musical Moment&quot;) (1933), &quot;Zwarcie&quot; (&quot;Short Circuit&quot;) (1935) and &quot;Przygoda Człowieka Poczciwego&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of a Good Citizen&quot;) (1937). These were shown with other experimental films of the time. All except &quot;Przygoda Człowieka Poczciwego&quot;, which remained in Warsaw, were lost in Paris in the Second World War, but the script for &quot;Europa&quot;, based on a poem by Anatol Stern was later published by the Themersons&#x27; &quot;Gaberbocchus Press&quot;, illustrated by surviving stills from the film and &quot;Apteka&quot; and &quot;Drobiazg melodyjny&quot; were remade by Bruce Checefsky from descriptions of them when they first appeared, stills and storyboards. In 1983 Stefan, now living in London, made a reconstruction of the film with the London Film-Makers&#x27; Co-op. An incomplete copy of the original film was found in an archive in Berlin in 2019. Following restitution to the Themerson Estate, it was donated to the British Film Institute for conservation and preservation.

In 1935, with other young filmmakers, the Themersons founded a cooperative, &quot;S.A.F&quot;, &quot;Spółdzielnia Autorów Filmowych&quot;.

==1936 to 1939==
In 1936 and 1937 the Themersons visited Paris, then the centre of the world for avant-garde art, and London, meeting Moholy-Nagy and other experimental artists and arranged first screenings of French and English avant-garde films on their return to Warsaw. They also founded a review &quot;Film Artistique&quot;, Stefan as editor, Franciszka as artistic editor (the journal of the film-makers&#x27; co-operative). Two issues were published, one on the French avant-garde, one on recent English film. A third issue, on the Polish Avant-garde, was planned but remained unpublished when, in the winter of 1937–38 they moved to Paris: &quot;I just knew I had to be in Paris.&quot; Themerson said. Here they found a circle of artists and writers, many Polish, among whom to live and move. Themerson wrote for various Polish publications in Paris; Franciszka started to paint, and illustrated children&#x27;s books for Flammarion. They planned to stay there, but – as for most of their generation – the outbreak of World War II changed their lives. With the declaration of war in 1939, the Themersons both enlisted, Stefan joined the Polish Army in the West forming in France after the German and Soviet invasions and partition of Poland. Franciszka was seconded to the Polish government-in-exile as a cartographer, first in France then from 1940 in London after the Fall of France.

==Second World War and after==
In 1940 Themerson volunteered for a Polish infantry regiment in France, just in time for the German invasion and the Allies&#x27; collapse. His memory was of marching day and night in the summer heat to St-Nazaire. There, in June, the regiment was disbanded, the officers abandoning their men and the men dispersing where they could. Themerson travelled inside France, first returning (on foot) to occupied Paris, then on to Toulouse, where, through the Polish Red Cross, he re-established contact with Franciszka. She had been working for the Polish Government in Exile as a cartographer in Paris and Normandy and had subsequently escaped to London on a troopship from Bayonne. Meanwhile, he spent time in refugee camps, worked as a farm labourer, and spent nearly two years in a Polish Red Cross hostel, the Hôtel de la Poste in Voiron. Here he began writing &quot;Professor Mmaa&#x27;s Lecture&quot; in Polish and wrote the long poem in French &quot;Croquis dans les Ténèbres&quot; (&quot;Sketches in Darkness&quot;). Much of their sporadic correspondence from the years 1940–1942 concerned attempts to engineer Stefan&#x27;s escape from France.

Towards the end of 1942 Themerson got across France via Marseille and Spain to Lisbon whence he was flown to Britain by the R.A.F., rejoining his wife and re-enlisting in the Polish army. He spent time with the army in Scotland, where he finished &quot;Professor Mmaa&quot;, and then was sent to join the film unit of the Polish Ministry of Information and Documentation in London. There he and Franciszka, commissioned by the Polish Ministry of Information and Documentation, made two further short films, &quot;Calling Mr. Smith&quot;, an account of Nazi atrocities in Poland and &quot;The Eye and the Ear&quot;, inspired by four Julian Tuwim songs set to music by Szymanowski. In 1944 at the PEN club meeting to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Areopagitica&quot;, Themerson met Kurt Schwitters, who became a close friend until Schwitters&#x27; death in 1948. At about the same time he met others who remained close, including Jankel Adler, Julian Trevelyan and Anthony Froshaug. Also in 1944 the Themersons moved to Maida Vale, where they lived for the rest of their lives. A close neighbour was the experimental poet and publisher Bob Cobbing with whom the Themersons kept close relations.

Stefan and Franciszka Themerson published many of their works through their own Gaberbocchus Press (the Latinised version of Jabberwocky) from 1948 to 1979. Most were designed and illustrated by Franciszka. They also worked with the translators Barbara Wright and Stanley Chapman, and the artist Gwen Barnard. Their list of some 70 titles included works by Guillaume Apollinaire, Jankel Adler and Kurt Schwitters, the first English translation of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;, Raymond Queneau&#x27;s &quot;Exercises in Style&quot; and &quot;The Good Citizen&#x27;s Alphabet&quot; by Bertrand Russell. The latter wrote an encouraging preface to &quot;Professor Mmaa’s Lecture&quot;. Influenced by Queneau and his Oulipo circle, whom they visited in 1950, Stefan was the inventor of Semantic Poetry (see his 1945 novel &quot;Bayamus&quot;, and his 1975 tract &quot;On Semantic Poetry&quot;). His work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, a US publication which explored language and meaning-making. He wrote an opera, &#x27;St. Francis and the Wolf of Gubbio&#x27; (1972). In 1981, Themerson delivered the annual Huizinga Lecture in Leiden in the Netherlands, under the title &quot;The Chair of Decency&quot;. He died in London, two months after the death of Franciszka, in September 1988.

==Legacy==
In 1979, the Gaberbocchus Press was taken over by Dutch publisher De Harmonie, at Themerson&#x27;s invitation. They maintain the press&#x27;s archive as well. It was through this Dutch connection that some of his novels gained recognition in the English-reading world; in 1985, Dutch publisher De Bezige Bij published a translation of an English manuscript, which they titled &quot;Euclid Was an Ass&quot; (Dutch: Euclides was een ezel&quot;). This book was read by someone with connections at Faber and Faber, which in turn published the book in English, now called &quot;The Mystery of the Sardine&quot; (1986), and his last novel &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Island&quot; (1988). These two novels and the earlier &quot;Tom Harris&quot; were later republished by Dalkey Archive Press.

The Themersons&#x27; eight volume archive has been assembled and catalogued by Franciszka&#x27;s niece, the British arts curator, Jasia Reichardt. A &quot;Themerson Festival&quot; takes place annually in Themerson&#x27;s native city, Płock in Poland.

<text>Allan Octavian Hume, CB ICS (4 June 1829 – 31 July 1912) was a British political reformer, ornithologist, civil servant and botanist who worked in British India and was the founding spirit and key founder of the Indian National Congress. He was a proponent of Indian self-rule and strongly supported the idea of Indian independence. He supported the idea of self-governance by Indians. A notable ornithologist, Hume has been called &quot;the Father of Indian Ornithology&quot; and, by those who found him dogmatic, &quot;the Pope of Indian Ornithology&quot;.

As the collector of Etawah, he saw the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as a result of misgovernance and made great efforts to improve the lives of the common people. The district of Etawah was among the first to be returned to normalcy and over the next few years Hume&#x27;s reforms led to the district being considered a model of development. Hume rose in the ranks of the Indian Civil Service but like his father Joseph Hume, a radical member of parliament, he was bold and outspoken in questioning British policies in India. He rose in 1871 to the position of secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture, and Commerce under Lord Mayo who was assassinated a year later. He did not get along as well with subsequent viceroys, and his criticism of Lord Lytton&#x27;s policies led to his removal from the Secretariat in 1879.

He founded the journal &quot;Stray Feathers&quot; in which he and his subscribers recorded notes on birds from across India. He built up a vast collection of bird specimens at his home in Shimla by making collection expeditions and obtaining specimens through his network of correspondents.

Following the loss of manuscripts that he had long worked on in the hope of producing a magnum opus on the birds of India, he abandoned ornithology and gifted his collection to the Natural History Museum in London, where it continues to be the single largest collection of Indian bird skins. He was briefly a follower of the theosophical movement founded by Madame Blavatsky. He worked for Indian self-governance through the Indian National Congress that he founded. He left India in 1894 to live in London from where he continued to take an interest in the Indian National Congress. He maintained an interest in English botany and founded the South London Botanical Institute towards the end of his life.

== Early life ==
Hume was born in Westminster, London and baptized at St Mary&#x27;s, Bryanston Square, a younger son (and the eighth child in a family of nine) of Joseph Hume, the Radical Scottish member of parliament, by his marriage to Maria Burnley. Until the age of eleven he was privately tutored growing up at the town house at 6 Bryanston Square in London and at their country estate, Burnley Hall in Norfolk. He was educated at University College Hospital, where he studied medicine and surgery and was then nominated to the Indian Civil Services which led him to study at the East India Company College, Haileybury. Early influences included his friend John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. He briefly served as a junior midshipman aboard a navy vessel in the Mediterranean in 1842.

==Civil service==
=== Etawah (1849–1867) ===
Hume sailed to India in 1849 and on reaching Calcutta, he stayed with his cousin James Hume, The following year, he joined the Bengal Civil Service at Etawah in the North-Western Provinces, in what is now Uttar Pradesh. His career in India included service as a district officer from 1849 to 1867, head of a central department from 1867 to 1870, and secretary to the Government from 1870 to 1879. He married Mary Anne (26 May 1824, Meerut – 30 March 1890, Simla), daughter of Rivers Francis Grindall (1786–1832) in 1853. He had a home, possibly used in summer, in Mussoorie in 1853.

It was only nine years after his entry to India that Hume faced the Indian Rebellion of 1857 during which time he was involved in several military actions for which he was created a Companion of the Bath in 1860. Initially it appeared that he was safe in Etawah, not far from Meerut where the rebellion began but this changed and Hume had to take refuge in Agra fort for six months. Nonetheless, all but one Indian official remained loyal and Hume resumed his position in Etawah in January 1858. He built up an irregular force of 650 loyal Indian troops and took part in engagements with them. Hume blamed British ineptitude for the uprising and pursued a policy of &quot;mercy and forbearance&quot; when dealing with the captured rebels. Only seven persons were executed at the gallows on his orders. The district of Etawah was restored to peace and order in a year, something that was not possible in most other parts.

Shortly after 1857, he set about in a range of reforms. As a District Officer in the Indian Civil Service, he began introducing free primary education and held public meetings for their support. He made changes in the functioning of the police department and the separation of the judicial role. Noting that there was very little reading material with educational content, he started, along with Koour Lutchman Singh, a Hindi language periodical, &quot;Lokmitra&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s Friend&quot;) in 1859. Originally meant only for Etawah, its fame spread. Hume also organized and managed an Urdu journal &quot;Muhib-i-riaya&quot;.

He took up the cause of education and founded scholarships for higher education. He wrote, in 1859, that education played a key role in avoiding revolts like the one in 1857:

&quot;… assert its supremacy as it may at the bayonet&#x27;s point, a free and civilized government must look for its stability and permanence to the enlightenment of the people and their moral and intellectual capacity to appreciate its blessings.&quot;

In 1863 he moved for separate schools for juvenile delinquents rather than flogging and imprisonment which he saw as producing hardened criminals. His efforts led to a juvenile reformatory not far from Etawah. He also started free schools in Etawah and by 1857 he established 181 schools with 5186 students including two girls. The high school that he helped build with his own money is still in operation, now as a junior college, and it was said to have a floor plan resembling the letter &quot;H&quot;. This, according to some was an indication of Hume&#x27;s imperial ego. Hume found the idea of earning revenue earned through liquor traffic repulsive and described it as &quot;The wages of sin&quot;. With his progressive ideas on social reform, he advocated women&#x27;s education, was against infanticide and enforced widowhood. Hume laid out in Etawah, a neatly gridded commercial district that is now known as Humeganj but often pronounced &quot;Homeganj&quot;.

=== Commissioner of Customs (1867–1870) ===
In 1867 Hume became Commissioner of Customs for the North West Province, and in 1870 he became attached to the central government as Director-General of Agriculture. In 1879 he returned to provincial government at Allahabad. His work on reducing the burden involved in the maintenance of the customs department controlling the movement of salt, which included the 2500 mile-long Inland Customs Line, the so-called great hedge, led to his promotion by Lord Mayo who rewarded him with Secretaryship and was moved in 1871 to the Department of Revenue and Agriculture.

=== Secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce (1871–1879) ===
Hume was very interested in the development of agriculture. He believed that there was too much focus on obtaining revenue and no effort had been spent on improving the efficiency of agriculture. He found an ally in Lord Mayo who supported the idea of developing a complete department of agriculture. Hume noted in his &quot;Agricultural reform in India&quot; that Lord Mayo had been the only Viceroy who had any experience of working in the fields.

Hume made a number of suggestions for the improvement of agriculture placing carefully gathered evidence for his ideas. He noted the poor yields of wheat, comparing them with estimates from the records of Emperor Akbar and yields of farms in Norfolk. Lord Mayo supported his ideas but was unable to establish a dedicated agricultural bureau as the scheme did not find support from the Secretary of State for India, but they negotiated the setting up of a &quot;Department of Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce&quot; despite Hume&#x27;s insistence that &quot;Agriculture&quot; be the first and foremost aim. The department had charge on land revenue, settlements, advances for works in agricultural improvement, horticulture, livestock breeding, silk, fiber, forests, commerce and trade, salt, opium, excise, stamps, and industrial art. It also collected data and was in charge of censuses, the gazetteers, surveys, geology, and meteorology. Hume was made Secretary of this department in July 1871 leading to his move to Shimla.

With the murder of Lord Mayo in the Andamans in 1872, Hume lost patronage and support for his work. He however went about reforming the department of agriculture, streamlining the collection of meteorological data (the meteorological department was set up by order number 56 on 27 September 1875 signed by Hume) and statistics on cultivation and yield.

Hume proposed the idea of having experimental farms to demonstrate best practices to be set up in every district. He proposed to develop fuelwood plantations &quot;in every village in the drier portions of the country&quot; and thereby provide a substitute heating and cooking fuel so that manure (dried cattle dung was used as fuel by the poor) could be returned to the land. Such plantations, he wrote, were &quot;&quot;a thing that is entirely in accord with the traditions of the country – a thing that the people would understand, appreciate, and, with a little judicious pressure, cooperate in.&quot; He wanted model farms to be established in every district. He noted that rural indebtedness was caused mainly by the use of land as security, a practice that had been introduced by the British. Hume denounced it as another of &quot;the cruel blunders into which our narrow-minded, though wholly benevolent, desire to reproduce England in India has led us.&quot;&quot; Hume also wanted government-run banks, at least until cooperative banks could be established.

The department also supported the publication of several manuals on aspects of cultivation, a list of which Hume included as an appendix to his &quot;Agricultural Reform in India&quot;. Hume supported the introduction of cinchona and the project managed by George King to produce quinine in India and deliver malaria medication across India through the postal department at low cost.

Hume was very outspoken and never feared to criticize when he thought the Government was in the wrong. Even in 1861, he objected to the concentration of police and judicial functions in the hands of police superintendents. In March 1861, he took a medical leave due to a breakdown from overwork and departed for Britain. Before leaving, he condemned the flogging and punitive measures initiated by the provincial government as &#x27;barbarous ... torture&#x27;. He was allowed to return to Etawah only after apologizing for the tone of his criticism. He criticized the administration of Lord Lytton before 1879 which according to him, had cared little for the welfare and aspiration of the people of India.

Lord Lytton&#x27;s foreign policy according to Hume had led to the waste of &quot;millions and millions of Indian money&quot;. Hume was critical of the land revenue policy and suggested that it was the cause of poverty in India. His superiors were irritated and attempted to restrict his powers and this led him to publish a book on &quot;Agricultural Reform in India&quot; in 1879.

Hume noted that the free and honest expression was not only permitted but encouraged under Lord Mayo and that this freedom was curtailed under Lord Northbrook who succeeded Lord Mayo. When Lord Lytton succeeded Lord Northbrook, the situation worsened for Hume. In 1879 Hume went against the authorities. The Government of Lord Lytton dismissed him from his position in the Secretariat. No clear reason was given except that it &quot;&quot;was based entirely on the consideration of what was most desirable in the interests of the public service&quot;. The press declared that his main wrongdoing was that he was too honest and too independent. The &quot;Pioneer&quot; wrote that it was &quot;the grossest jobbery ever perpetrated&quot;&quot; ; the &quot;Indian Daily News&quot; wrote that it was a &quot;great wrong&quot; while &quot;The Statesman&quot; said that &quot;undoubtedly he has been treated shamefully and cruelly.&quot; &quot;The Englishman&quot; in an article dated 27 June 1879, commenting on the event stated, &quot;There is no security or safety now for officers in Government employment.&quot; Demoted, he left Shimla and returned to the North-West Provinces in October 1879, as a member of the Board of Revenue. It has pointed out that he was victimized as he was out of step with the policies of the Government, often intruding into aspects of administration with critical opinions.

=== Demotion and resignation (1879–1882) ===
In spite of the humiliation of demotion, he did not resign immediately from service and it has been suggested that this was because he needed his salary to support the publication of &quot;The Game Birds of India&quot; that he was working on. Hume retired from the civil service only in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of Calcutta University, having been a fellow of the University of Calcutta from 1870, calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay. In 1887, writing to the Public Commission of India, he made what was then a statement unexpected from a civil servant — &quot;I look upon myself as a Native of India&quot;.

=== Return to England 1894 ===

Hume&#x27;s wife Mary died on 30 March 1890 and news of her death reached him just as he reached London on 1 April 1890. Their only daughter Maria Jane Burnley (&quot;Minnie&quot;) (1854–1927) had married Ross Scott at Shimla on 28 December 1881. Maria became a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, another occult movement, after moving to England. Ross Scott had been the founding secretary of the Simla Eclectic Theosophical Society, and was sometime Judicial Commissioner of Oudh before his death in 1908. Hume&#x27;s grandson Montague Allan Hume Scott served with the Royal Engineers in India, and received a Military Cross in 1917.

Hume left India in 1894 and settled at The Chalet, 4 Kingswood Road, Upper Norwood in south London. He died at the age of eighty-three on 31 July 1912. His ashes were buried in Brookwood Cemetery. The bazaar in Etawah was closed on hearing of his death and the Collector, H. R. Nevill, presided over a memorial meeting.

The Indian postal department issued a commemorative stamp with his portrait in 1973 and a special cover depicting Rothney Castle, his home in Shimla, was released in 2013.

==Indian National Congress==


Hume was noted for his pro-Indian activities. He believed that the British regime had failed in India, not from any lack of good attention but rather because of insufficient knowledge.

There were agrarian riots in the Deccan and Bombay, and Hume, according to some early writers like Pattabhi Sitaramayya, suggested that an Indian Union would be a good safety valve and outlet to avoid further unrest. This so-called &quot;safety valve&quot; theory of the origin of the Congress, first introduced by W.C. Bonnerjee, has been refuted on the basis that the seven volumes of the secret report were fictional. They were created by William Wedderburn to portray Hume as a British patriot. After retiring from the civil services and towards the end of Lord Lytton&#x27;s rule, Hume observed that the people of India had a sense of hopelessness and wanted to do something, noting &quot;a sudden violent outbreak of sporadic crime, murders of obnoxious persons, robbery of bankers and looting of bazaars, acts really of lawlessness which by a due coalescence of forces might any day develop into a National Revolt.&quot; Of the British government, he stated that &quot;a studied and invariable disregard, if not actually contempt for the opinions and feelings of our subjects, is at the present day the leading characteristic of our government in every branch of the administration.&quot; On 1 March 1883, Hume wrote a letter to the graduates of the University of Calcutta:
In 1886 he published a pamphlet &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Hope&quot; in which he examined poverty in India, questioning charity as a solution for the problem. Here he makes a case for Richard Cobden&#x27;s Anti-Corn Law League as a model for the struggle in India through the formation of a representative body.

His poem &quot;Awake&quot; published in Calcutta in 1886 also captures the sentiment:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sons of Ind, why sit ye idle,
Wait ye for some Deva&#x27;s aid?
Buckle to, be up and doing!
Nations by themselves are made!

Yours the land, lives, all, at stake, tho &#x27;
Not by you the cards are played;
Are ye dumb? Speak up and claim them!
By themselves are nations made!

What avail your wealth, your learning,
Empty titles, sordid trade?
True self-rule were worth them all!
Nations by themselves are made!

Whispered murmurs darkly creeping,
Hidden worms beneath the glade,
Not by such shall wrong be righted!
Nations by themselves are made!

Are ye Serfs or are ye Freemen,
Ye that grovel in the shade?
In your own hands rest the issues!
By themselves are nations made!

Sons of Ind, be up and doing,
Let your course by none be stayed;
Lo! the Dawn is in the East;
By themselves are nations made!
&lt;/poem&gt;

The idea of the Indian National Union took shape and Hume initially had some support from Lord Dufferin for this, although the latter wished to have no official link to it. Dufferin&#x27;s support was short-lived and in some of his letters he went so far as to call Hume an &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;arch-impostor&quot;, and &quot;mischievous busy-body.&quot; Dufferin&#x27;s successor Lansdowne refused to have any dialogue with Hume. Other supporters in England included James Caird (who had also clashed with Lytton over the management of famine in India) and John Bright. Hume also founded an Indian Telegraph Union to fund the transfer of news of Indian matters to newspapers in England and Scotland without interference from British Indian officials who controlled telegrams sent by Reuters. It has been suggested that the idea of the congress was originally conceived in a private meeting of seventeen men after a Theosophical Convention held at Madras in December 1884 but no evidence exists. Hume took the initiative, and it was in March 1885, when a notice was first issued to convene the first Indian National Union to meet at Poona the following December.

He attempted to increase the Congress base by bringing in more farmers, townspeople and Muslims between 1886 and 1887 and this created a backlash from the British, leading to backtracking by the Congress. Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty. Some Indian princes did not like the idea of democracy and some organizations like the United Indian Patriotic Association went about trying to undermine the Congress by showing it as an organization with a seditious character. There was also major rifts along religious lines within the Congress on issues such as the Age of Consent Bill. In 1892, he tried to get the members to act, warning of a violent agrarian revolution but this only outraged the British establishment and frightened the Congress leaders. Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders willing to work for the cause of national emancipation, Hume left India in 1894.

Many Anglo-Indians were against the idea of the Indian National Congress. The press in India tended to look upon it negatively, so much so that Hume is said to have held a very low opinion of journalists even later in life. A satirical work on native rule, &quot;India in 1983&quot;, published (anonymously but thought to be written by T. Hart Davies) in 1888 included a character derisively called &quot;A. O. Humebogue&quot;.

The organizers of the 27th session of the Indian National Congress at Bankipur (26–28 December 1912) recorded their &quot;profound sorrow at the death of Allan Octavian Hume, C.B., father and founder of the Congress, to whose lifelong services, rendered at rare self-sacrifice, India feels deep and lasting gratitude, and in whose death the cause of Indian progress and reform sustained irreparable loss.&quot;

==Contribution to ornithology and natural history==
From early days, Hume had a special interest in science. Science, he wrote:

and of natural history he wrote in 1867:
During his career in Etawah, he built up a personal collection of bird specimens, however the first collection that he made was destroyed during the 1857 rebellion. After 1857 Hume made several expeditions to collect birds both on health leave and where work took him. He was Collector and Magistrate of Etawah from 1856 to 1867 during which time he studied the birds of that area. Around 1867 he transferred about 2500 specimens from his collection to a museum in Agra. His most systematic work however began after he moved to Shimla. He later became Commissioner of Inland Customs which made him responsible for the control of of coast from near Peshawar in the northwest to Cuttack on the Bay of Bengal. He travelled on horseback and camel in areas of Rajasthan to negotiate treaties with various local maharajas to control the export of salt, and during these travels he took note of the birdlife.

Hume appears to have planned a comprehensive work on the birds of India around 1870 and a &quot;forthcoming comprehensive work&quot; finds mention in the second edition of &quot;The Cyclopaedia of India&quot; (1871) by his cousin Edward Balfour. His systematic plan to survey and document the birds of the Indian Subcontinent began in earnest after he started accumulating the largest collection of Asiatic birds in his personal museum and library at home in Rothney Castle on Jakko Hill, Simla. Rothney Castle, originally Rothney House was built by Colonel Octavius Edward Rothney (1824–1881) and later owned by P. Mitchell, C.I.E. from whom Hume bought it and converted it into a palatial house with the hope that it might be bought by the Government as a Viceregal residence since the Governor-General then occupied &quot;Peterhoff&quot;, a building too small for large parties. Hume spent over two hundred thousand pounds on the grounds and buildings. He added enormous reception rooms suitable for large dinner parties and balls, as well as a magnificent conservatory and spacious hall with walls displaying his superb collection of Indian horns. He used a large room for his bird museum. He hired a European gardener, and made the grounds and conservatory a perpetual horticultural exhibition, to which he courteously admitted all visitors. Rothney Castle could only be reached by a steep road, and was never purchased by the British Government.

Hume made several expeditions almost solely to study ornithology, the largest being an expedition to the Indus area begun in late November 1871 and continued until the end of February 1872. He was assisted here by Sir W. Merewether and Francis Day. In March 1873, he visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal along with geologists Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka and Valentine Ball of the Geological Survey of India and James Wood-Mason of the Indian Museum in Calcutta. They were also accompanied by Surgeon-Major Joseph Dougall, medical superintendent at Port Blair, six native trappers-skinners, and supported by others like Jeremiah Nelson Homfray, superintendent of the Andaman orphanage. In 1875, he made an expedition to the Laccadive Islands aboard the marine survey vessel IGS &quot;Clyde&quot; under the command of Staff-Commander Ellis and accompanied by surgeon-naturalist James Armstrong of the Marine Survey. The official purpose of the visit was ostensibly to examine proposed sites for lighthouses. During this expedition Hume collected many bird specimens, apart from conducting a bathymetric survey to determine whether the island chain was separated from continental India by a deep canyon. And in 1881 he made his last ornithological expedition to Manipur, a visit in which he collected and described the Manipur bush quail (&quot;Perdicula manipurensis&quot;), a bird that has remained obscure with few reliable reports since. Hume spent an extra day with his assistants cutting down a large tract of grass so that he could obtain specimens of this species. This expedition was made on special leave following his demotion from the Central Government to a junior position on the Board of Revenue of the North Western Provinces. Apart from personal travel, he also sent out a trained bird-skinner to accompany officers travelling in areas of ornithological interest such as Afghanistan. Around 1878 he was spending about £1500 a year on his ornithological surveys.

Hume was a member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal from January 1870 to 1891 and admitted Fellow of the Linnean Society on 3 November 1904. After returning to England in 1890 he also became president of the Dulwich Liberal and Radical Association.

===Collection===

Hume used his vast bird collection to good use as editor of his journal &quot;Stray Feathers&quot;. He also intended to produce a comprehensive publication on the birds of India. Hume employed William Ruxton Davison, who was brought to notice by Dr. George King, as a curator for his personal bird collection. Hume trained Davison and sent him out annually on collection trips to various parts of India as he himself was held up with official responsibilities. In 1883 Hume returned from a trip to find that many pages of the manuscripts that he had maintained over the years had been stolen and sold off as waste paper by a servant. Hume was completely devastated and he began to lose interest in ornithology due to this theft and a landslip, caused by heavy rains in Simla, which had damaged his museum and many of the specimens. He wrote to the British Museum wishing to donate his collection on certain conditions. One of the conditions was that the collection was to be examined by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe and personally packed by him, apart from raising Dr. Sharpe&#x27;s rank and salary due to the additional burden on his work caused by his collection. The British Museum was unable to heed his many conditions. It was only in 1885, after the destruction of nearly 20,000 specimens, that alarm bells were raised by Dr. Sharpe and the museum authorities let him visit India to supervise the transfer of the specimens to the British Museum.

Sharpe visited Hume&#x27;s private ornithological museum at home and oversaw the packing of specimens for England.: He noted later that:
The Hume collection of birds was packed into 47 cases made of deodar wood constructed on site without nails that could potentially damage specimens and each case weighing about half a ton was transported down the hill to a bullock cart to Kalka and finally the port in Bombay. The material that went to the British Museum in 1885 consisted of 82,000 specimens of which 75,577 (258 being type specimens) were finally placed in the museum. A breakup of that collection is as follows (old names retained). Hume had destroyed 20,000 specimens prior to this as they had been damaged by dermestid beetles. In addition his donations included 223 game trophies and 371 mammal skins.

The Hume Collection contained 258 type specimens. In addition there were nearly 400 mammal specimens including new species such as &quot;Hadromys humei&quot;.

The egg collection was made up of carefully authenticated contributions from knowledgeable contacts and on the authenticity and importance of the collection, E. W. Oates noted in the 1901 &quot;Catalogue of the Collection of Birds&#x27; Eggs in the British Museum&quot; (Volume 1) that the collection was made up of specimens of known provenance and not accumulated through indiscriminate purchases as tended to be the case with many other collectors.

Hume and his collector Davison took an interest in plants as well. Specimens were collected even on the first expedition to the Lakshadweep in 1875 were studied by George King and later by David Prain. Hume&#x27;s herbarium specimens were donated to the collection of the Botanical Survey of India at Calcutta.

===Taxa described===

Hume described many species, some of which are now considered as subspecies. A single genus name that he erected survives in use while others such as &quot;Heteroglaux&quot; Hume, 1873 have sunk into synonymy since. In addition to birds, he described a species of goat as &quot;Ovis blanfordi&quot; in 1877 based on a variation in the horns. It is now considered a variant of the urial (&quot;Ovis vignei&quot;). In his concept of species, Hume was an essentialist and held the idea that small but constant differences defined species. He appreciated the ideas of speciation and how it contradicted divine creation but preferred to maintain a position that did not reject a Creator.

An additional species, the large-billed reed-warbler &quot;Acrocephalus orinus&quot; was known from just one specimen collected by him in 1869 but the name that he used, &quot;magnirostris&quot;, was found to be preoccupied and replaced by the name &quot;orinus&quot; provided by Harry Oberholser in 1905. The status of the species was contested until DNA comparisons with similar species in 2002 suggested that it was a valid species. It was only in 2006 that the species was seen in the wild in Thailand, with a match to the specimens confirmed using DNA sequencing. Later searches in museums led to several other specimens that had been overlooked and based on the specimen localities, a breeding region was located in Tajikistan and documented in 2011.

This was Hume&#x27;s first major work on birds. It had 422 pages and accounts of 81 species. It was dedicated to Edward Blyth and Dr. Thomas C. Jerdon who, he wrote &quot;[had] done more for Indian Ornithology than all other modern observers put together&quot; and he described himself as &quot;their friend and pupil&quot;. He hoped that his collation, which he noted as being of a poor quality, would form a &quot;nucleus round which future observation may crystallize&quot; and that others around the country could help him &quot;fill in many of the woeful blanks remaining in record&quot;. He offered to supply anyone interested with a list of species for which more information was needed and noted that Ceylon and Burma were major geographical gaps as he had no correspondents from there.

Hume was a careful reader of the ornithological literature and routinely communicated on them. In 1875 he noted that Friedrich Wilhelm Meves had confirmed through chemical analysis that the brown coloration of lammergeiers was due to an external deposition of iron-oxide. Hume wrote in the Scrap Book and commented on Meves&#x27; theory that the source may have been blood rather than through bathing in iron-rich water. Hume had repeated the chemical analysis and confirmed the presence of iron.

===&quot;Stray Feathers&quot;===
Hume started the quarterly journal &quot;Stray Feathers&quot; in 1872. At that time the only journal for the Indian region that published on ornithology was the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; and Hume published only two letters in 1870, mainly being a list of errors in the list of Godwin-Austen which had been reduced to an abstract. Several other papers that he submitted to the &quot;Ibis&quot; had not been published and delays in post were common. In his preface he also examined if there was merit to start a new journal and in that idea was supported by Stoliczka, who was also an editor for the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society&quot;:
The President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Thomas Oldham, in the annual address for 1873 wrote - &quot;We could have wished that the author had  completed the several works which he had already commenced, rather than started a new publication. But we heartily welcome at the same time the issue of &quot;&#x27;Stray Feathers&quot;.&#x27; It promises to be a useful catalogue of the Editor&#x27;s very noble collection of Indian Birds, and a means of rapid publication of novelties or corrections, always of much value with ornithologists.&quot; Hume used the journal to publish descriptions of his new discoveries. He wrote extensively on his own observation as well as critical reviews of all the ornithological works of the time and earned himself the nickname of &quot;Pope of Indian ornithology&quot;. He critiqued a monograph on parrots, &quot;Die Papageien&quot; by Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch suggesting that name changes (by &quot;cabinet naturalists&quot;) were aimed at claiming authority to species without the trouble of actually discovering them. He wrote:

Hume in turn was attacked, for instance by Viscount Walden, but Finsch became a friend and Hume named a species, &quot;Psittacula finschii&quot;, after him.

In his younger days Hume had studied some geology from the likes of Gideon Mantell and appreciated the synthesis of ideas from other fields into ornithology. Hume included in 1872, a detailed article on the osteology of birds in relation to their classification written by Richard Lydekker who was then in the Geological Survey of India. The early meteorological work in India was done within the department headed by Hume and he saw the value of meteorology in the study of bird distributions. In a work comparing the rainfall zones, he notes how the high rainfall zones indicated affinities to the Malayan fauna.

Hume sometimes mixed personal beliefs in notes that he published in &quot;Stray Feathers&quot;. For instance he believed that vultures soared by altering the physics (&quot;altered polarity&quot;) of their body and repelling the force of gravity. He further noted that this ability was normal in birds and could be acquired by humans by maintaining spiritual purity, claiming that he knew of at least three Indian Yogis and numerous saints in the past with this ability of &quot;aethrobacy&quot;.

===Network of correspondents===

Hume corresponded with a large number of ornithologists and sportsmen who helped him by reporting from various parts of India. More than 200 correspondents are listed in his &quot;Game Birds&quot; alone and they probably represent only a fraction of the subscribers of &quot;Stray Feathers&quot;. This large network made it possible for Hume to cover a much larger geographic region in his ornithological work.

During the lifetime of Hume, Blyth was considered the father of Indian ornithology. Hume&#x27;s achievement which made use of a large network of correspondents was recognised even during his time. James Murray noted of Hume that &quot;the palm is his as an authority above the rest&quot; when it came to the birds of India and that all future work would be built upon his work.

Many of Hume&#x27;s correspondents were eminent naturalists and sportsmen who were posted in India.

Hume exchanged skins with other collectors. A collection made principally by Hume that belonged to the Earl of Northbrook was gifted to Oxford University in 1877. One of his correspondents, Louis Mandelli from Darjeeling, stands out by claiming that he was swindled in these skin exchanges. He claimed that Hume took skins of rarer species in exchange for the skins of common birds but the credibility of the complaint has been doubted. Hume named &quot;Arborophila mandelli&quot; after Mandelli in 1874. The only other naturalist to question Hume&#x27;s veracity was A.L. Butler who met a Nicobar islander whom Hume had described as diving nearly stark naked and capturing fish with his bare hands. Butler found the man in denial of such fishing techniques.

Hume corresponded and stayed up to date with the works of ornithologists outside India including R. Bowdler Sharpe, the Marquis of Tweeddale, Père David, Henry Eeles Dresser, Benedykt Dybowski, John Henry Gurney, J. H. Gurney, Jr., Johann Friedrich Naumann, Nikolai Severtzov and Dr. Aleksandr Middendorff. He helped George Ernest Shelley with specimens from India aiding the publication of a monograph on the sunbirds of the world (1876–1880).

===Collector&#x27;s &quot;Vade Mecum&quot; (1874)===

Hume&#x27;s vast collection from across India was possible because he began to correspond with coadjutors across India. He ensured that these contributors made accurate notes, and obtained and processed specimens carefully. The &quot;Vade Mecum&quot; was published to save him the trouble of sending notes to potential collaborators who sought advice. Materials for preservation are carefully tailored for India with the provision of the local names for ingredients and methods to prepare glues and preservatives with easy to find equipment. Apart from skinning and preservation, the book also covers matters of observation, keeping records, the use of natives to capture birds, obtain eggs and the care needed in obtaining other information apart from care in labelling.

===&quot;Game Birds of India, Burmah and Ceylon&quot; (1879–1881)===
This work was co-authored by C. H. T. Marshall. The three volume work on the game birds was made using contributions and notes from a network of 200 or more correspondents. Hume delegated the task of getting the plates made to Marshall. The chromolithographs of the birds were drawn by W. Foster, E. Neale, (Miss) M. Herbert, Stanley Wilson and others and the plates were produced by F. Waller in London. Hume had sent specific notes on colours of soft parts and instructions to the artists. He was dissatisfied with many of the plates and included additional notes on the plates in the book. This book was started at the point when the government demoted Hume and only the need to finance the publication of this book prevented him from retiring from service. He had estimated that it would cost £4000 to publish it and he retired from service on 1 January 1882 after the publication.

===&quot;Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds&quot; (1883)===
This was another major work by Hume and in it he covered descriptions of the nests, eggs and the breeding seasons of most Indian bird species. It makes use of notes from contributors to his journals as well as other correspondents and works of the time. Hume also makes insightful notes such as observations on caged females separated from males that would continue to lay fertile eggs through the possibility of sperm storage and the reduction in parental care by birds that laid eggs in warm locations (mynas in the Andamans, river terns on sand banks).

A second edition of this book was made in 1889 which was edited by Eugene William Oates. This was published when he had himself given up all interest in ornithology, an event precipitated by the loss of his manuscripts through the actions of a servant.

He wrote in the preface:

This nearly marked the end of Hume&#x27;s interest in ornithology. Hume&#x27;s last piece of ornithological writing was part of an &quot;Introduction to the Scientific Results of the Second Yarkand Mission&quot; in 1891, an official publication on the contributions of Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka, who died during the return journey on this mission. Stoliczka in a dying request had asked that Hume edit the volume on ornithology.

===Taxa named after Hume===
A number of birds are named after Hume, including:
*Hume&#x27;s ground tit, &quot;Pseudopodoces humilis&quot;
*Hume&#x27;s wheatear, &quot;Oenanthe albonigra&quot;
*Hume&#x27;s boobook, &quot;Ninox obscura&quot;
*Hume&#x27;s short-toed lark, &quot;Calandrella acutirostris&quot;
*Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler, &quot;Phylloscopus humei&quot;
*Hume&#x27;s whitethroat, &quot;Sylvia althaea&quot;
*Hume&#x27;s treecreeper, &quot;Certhia manipurensis&quot;

Specimens of other animal groups collected by Hume on his expeditions and named after him include the Manipur bush rat, &quot;Hadromys humei&quot; (Thomas, 1886) while some others like &quot;Hylaeocarcinus humei&quot;, a land crab from the Narcondam Island collected by Hume was described by James Wood-Mason, and Hume&#x27;s argali, &quot;Ovis ammon humei&quot; Lydekker 1913 (now treated as &quot;Ovis ammon karelini&quot;, Severtzov, 1873) are no longer considered valid.

==Theosophy==

Hume&#x27;s interest in theosophy took root around 1879. An 1880 newspaper reports the initiation of his daughter and wife into the movement. Hume did not have great regard for institutional Christianity, but believed in the immortality of the soul and in the idea of a supreme ultimate. Hume wanted to become a &quot;chela&quot; (student) of the Tibetan spiritual gurus. During the few years of his connection with the Theosophical Society Hume wrote three articles on &quot;Fragments of Occult Truth&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;H. X.&quot; published in &quot;The Theosophist&quot;. These were written in response to questions from Mr. W.H. Terry, an Australian Theosophist.

He also privately printed several Theosophical pamphlets titled &quot;Hints on Esoteric Theosophy&quot;. The later numbers of the Fragments, in answer to the same enquirer, were written by A.P. Sinnett and signed by him, as authorized by Mahatma K. H., &quot;A Lay-Chela.&quot; Hume also wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Aletheia&quot;.

Madame Blavatsky was a regular visitor at Hume&#x27;s Rothney castle at Simla and an account of her visit may be found in &quot;Simla, Past and Present&quot; by Edward John Buck (whose father Sir Edward Charles Buck succeeded Hume as secretary to the Revenue and Agricultural Department).

A long story about Hume and his wife appears in A.P. Sinnett&#x27;s book &quot;The Occult World&quot;, and the synopsis was published in a local paper of India. The story relates how at a dinner party, Madame Blavatsky asked Mrs Hume if there was anything she wanted. She replied that there was a brooch, her mother had given her, that had gone out of her possession some time ago. Blavatsky said she would try to recover it through occult means. After some interlude, later that evening, the brooch was found in a garden, where the party was directed by Blavatsky. According to John Murdoch (1894), the brooch had been given by Mrs. Hume to her daughter who had given it to a man she admired. Blavatsky had happened to meet the man in Bombay and obtained the brooch in return for money. Blavatsky allegedly planted it in the garden before directing people to the location through what she claimed as occult techniques.

After the incident, Hume too had privately expressed grave doubts on the powers attributed to Madame Blavatsky. He subsequently held a meeting with some of the Indian members of the Theosophical Society and suggested that they join hands with him to force the resignation of Blavatsky and sixteen other members for their role as accomplices in fraud. Those present could however not agree to the idea of seeking the resignation of their founder. Hume also tried to write a book on the philosophical basis of Theosophy. His drafts were strongly disapproved by many of the key Theosophists. One (&quot;K.H&quot;=Koot Humi) wrote:

Hume soon fell out of favour with the Theosophists and lost all interest in the theosophical movement in 1883.

Hume&#x27;s interest in theosophy brought him into contact with many independent Indian thinkers like Gopal Krishna Gokhale who also had nationalist ideas and this led to the idea of creating the Indian National Congress.

Hume&#x27;s immersion into the theosophical movement led him to become a vegetarian and also to give up killing birds for their specimens.

==South London Botanical Institute==
After the loss of his manuscript containing his lifetime of ornithological notes, Hume gave up ornithology and took great interest in horticulture around his home in Shimla. ... He erected large conservatories in the grounds of Rothney Castle, filled them with the choicest flowers, and engaged English gardeners to help him in the work. From this, on returning to England, he went on to scientific botany. But this, as Kipling says, is another story, and must be left to another pen.

Hume took an interest in wild plants and especially on invasive species although his botanical publishing was sparse with only three short notes between 1901 and 1902 including one on a variety of &quot;Scirpus maritimus&quot;, and another on the flowering of &quot;Impatiens roylei&quot;. Hume contacted W.H. Griffin in 1901 to help develop a herbarium of botanical specimens. Hume would arrange his plants on herbarium sheets in artistic positions before pressing them. The two made many botanical trips including one to Down in Kent to seek some of the rare orchids that had been collected by Darwin. In 1910, Hume bought the premises of 323 Norwood Road, and modified it to have a herbarium and library. He called this establishment the South London Botanical Institute (SLBI) with the aim of &quot;promoting, encouraging, and facilitating, amongst the residents of South London, the study of the science of botany.&quot;

One of the aims of the institute was to help promote botany as a means for mental culture and relaxation, an idea that was not shared by Henry Groves, a trustee for the institute. Hume objected to advertisement and refused to have any public ceremony to open the institute. The first curator was W.H. Griffin and Hume endowed the institute with £10,000. Frederick Townsend, F.L.S., an eminent botanist, who died in 1905, had left instructions that his herbarium and collection was to be given to the institute, which was then only being contemplated. Hume left £15,000 in his will for the maintenance of the botanical institute.

In the years leading up to the establishment of the institute, Hume built up links with many of the leading botanists of his day. He worked with F. H. Davey and in the &quot;Flora of Cornwall&quot; (1909), Davey thanks Hume as his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for help in the compilation of the &#x27;Flora&#x27;, publication of which was financed by Hume. The SLBI has since grown to hold a herbarium of approximately 100,000 specimens mostly of flowering plants from Europe including many collected by Hume. The collection was later augmented by the addition of other herbaria over the years, and has significant collections of &quot;Rubus&quot; (bramble) species and of the Shetland flora.

<text>Halesowen ( ) is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the county of the West Midlands, England.

Historically an exclave of Shropshire and, from 1844, in Worcestershire, the town is around from Birmingham city centre, and from Dudley town centre. The population at the 2011 Census, was 58,135. Halesowen is in the Halesowen parliamentary constituency.

==Geography and administration==
Halesowen was a detached part of the county of Shropshire but was incorporated into Worcestershire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Since the local government reorganisation of 1974 it has formed a part of the West Midlands Metropolitan county and Conurbation, in the Dudley Metropolitan Borough, which it joined at the same time as neighbouring Stourbridge, which had also been in Worcestershire until that point.

Halesowen borders the Birmingham suburbs of Quinton and Bartley Green to the east. To the south is Romsley and Worcestershire, to the north is Cradley Heath and to the west is Stourbridge.

Although predominantly urban or suburban in character, Halesowen borders on green belt land with excellent access to the countryside, for example the Clent Hills. It has extensive road links including Junction 3 of the M5 motorway, which allow easy commuting to Birmingham, other areas of the Black County or nationwide. The centre of Birmingham is approximately 30 minutes away by car and reachable by the number 9 or X10 buses, which are run by National Express West Midlands.

The centre of Halesowen is home to a Norman church, a football ground (where non-league Halesowen Town play) and Halesowen College which was founded in 1939.

Most of the housing stock in Halesowen is privately owned and was built in the 30 years which followed the end of the Second World War, although some parts of the town are still made up of Victorian and Edwardian terraced houses. The town centre was almost completely rebuilt during the 1960s and 1970s.

===Suburbs===
In 1974, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council identified six historical suburbs within Halesowen, which they signed accordingly with a series of gateway signs. In addition to the town centre, these are listed below. A separate sign for Illey was added many years later.

* Cradley
* Hasbury
* Hawne
* Hayley Green
* Hill &amp; Cakemore
* Lapal

==History==

Halesowen is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being larger than Birmingham. The manor and town was known as &quot;Hala&quot; (from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;halh&quot;, meaning nook or remote valley), until it was given by King Henry II to Welsh Prince Dafydd ab Owain in 1177 and became known as &quot;Halas Owen&quot;. The parish of Halesowen, which incorporated other townships later to become independent parishes, was an exclave of the county of Shropshire, but grew to become a town and was transferred to the jurisdiction of Worcestershire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Included in the boundaries was the ancient village of Brettle. Halesowen appears on censuses and maps into the nineteenth century also as Hales Owen.
In the 1220s, Halesowen had a market and fair and, by 1270, it had been granted a charter of liberties by its lord, the Premonstratensian Abbey of Halesowen. By 1300, it is estimated that the population was around 600. The court rolls for Halesowen survive from 1272 and show that the majority of migrants to Halesowen in the 14th century were women at 75%. Little was done to remove them and many went on to become small retailers in the area.

The village is well known by medieval historians for the conflict that took place around this time. In 1279, as the Abbot attempted to increase labour services for his tenants (which had been fixed in 1244), the peasants attempted to plead their case in the King&#x27;s Court, a privilege forbidden to unfree villeins. The Abbot thus fined them £10 which was a large sum at the time, and resistance, led by Roger Ketel, heightened. The conflict was snuffed out in 1282 as Ketel and Alice Edrich (the pregnant wife of another prominent rebel) were murdered by thugs hired by the abbey.

During the 18th century Halesowen developed rapidly as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The manufacture of nails was the staple trade in the town and many mills were used for slitting and iron production. Coal had been mined in the area from at least the reign of Edward I. Dating to 1893, Coombes Wood was the largest colliery in the town; at its peak in 1919 Halesowen had 130 working mines.

During the French Revolutionary War Halesowen raised a troop of volunteer cavalry by 1798, which in 1814 became part of the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry.

Halesowen became the centre of a poor law union in the 19th century, which later became established as a rural sanitary district and later the Halesowen Rural District in 1894. Oldbury was included into the area of Halesowen under the Halesowen Inclosure Act 1829 (10 Geo. 4. c. &quot;25&quot; ). With increasing urbanisation of the area, in the early 20th century, it became the Halesowen Urban District in 1925, and obtained a grant of charter to become a municipal borough in 1936. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Halesowen was incorporated into the new Dudley Metropolitan Borough, in the Metropolitan county of the West Midlands.

Halesowen was once served by a railway line – in reality two lines which met at an end-on junction at the station. The first was a branch of the Great Western Railway from Old Hill to Halesowen, opened in 1878, followed in 1883 by a section jointly owned by the Great Western and the Midland Railway (though worked mostly by the latter), linking the town with Northfield on the Midland Railway&#x27;s Birmingham to Bristol main line, with intermediate stations at Rubery, Hunnington, and a workmen&#x27;s halt at Longbridge serving the car factories (not to be confused with the present Longbridge station). Being largely rural in character, the line failed to attract much traffic and regular passenger services ended between Halesowen and Northfield as far back as 1919, and between Old Hill and Halesowen in 1927, though the workmen&#x27;s trains continued to serve Longbridge until 1960. The line is now lifted, but the track-bed can be seen close to the town, although there is no sign of the station. The goods shed remained until recently, serving as an industrial unit though it has now been demolished.

In the 1960s, the town centre underwent vast redevelopment which saw most of the older buildings demolished. The high street was pedestrianised and a shopping precinct (called &quot;The Precinct&quot;) was developed, housing many new retail units as well as a new public library. The centre was refurbished in the late 1980s and placed under cover, being renamed The Cornbow Centre at this time.

Trade in the town centre declined between 1985 and 1990 as the Merry Hill Shopping Centre some away at Brierley Hill was developed, although not as severely as it declined in Stourbridge and in particular Dudley. The only high-profile casualty was the J Sainsbury supermarket, which closed in 1992 due to the popularity of the store which had opened at Merry Hill three years earlier to succeed the Dudley store – combined with the onset of the recession at the start of the 1990s.

A further upgrading of the town centre took place in 2007 and 2008, with part of the Cornbow Centre (including a petrol station and several smaller retail units) being demolished to make way for a new Asda superstore which opened on 24 November 2008. The bus station was also rebuilt. This 18-month £30 million project was completed in December 2008 and the town received a commendation for the work by the Retail Property Organisation.

==Landmarks==
In the eastern part of Halesowen is Leasowes Park, which is considered to be one of the first natural landscape gardens in England. The 18th-century poet William Shenstone designed the garden, beginning works in 1743 and continuing until his death in 1763, transforming existing farmland he had inherited after his parents&#x27; death. Today, the parkland is Grade One Listed, as it is of national importance. The local theatre and a Wetherspoon&#x27;s public house are both named after William Shenstone as are at least two roads in the locality.

The Parish Church of St John the Baptist was founded by Roger de Montgomery and stands on the site of an even earlier Anglo-Saxon church. Several extensions have been made including the outer south aisle which was added in 1883 by John Oldrid Scott although there is still much evidence of the original Norman work. A Medieval cross stands in the churchyard, having previously stood in Great Cornbow until it was blown down by a gale in 1908.

Nearby are the ruins of Halesowen Abbey, founded in 1215 by Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. The Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the Abbey pass into private hands in 1538. The Abbey was the subject of an archaeological evaluation by Birmingham Archaeology and is now owned and managed by English Heritage.

Most of the town centre was rebuilt in the 1960s to create a modern shopping area that incorporated a new library as well as many supermarkets and shops centred around the Cornbow Centre. This was refurbished in the late 1980s to create a covered shopping area.

In 2007–08, Halesowen underwent a £30 million regeneration of part of its town centre, which has included the construction of a new Asda supermarket located in the Cornbow Centre, together with a new multi-storey car park, a rebuilt bus station and improvements to the road layout.

==Economy==
The principal industry of Halesowen was traditionally nail making, an industry that was performed on a small scale individually in the backyards of a large number of nail makers. Halesowen also had, along with most other areas of the Black Country, a large number of above and underground coal mines. In more recent years, the arrival of a junction of the motorway network allowed Halesowen to attract a number of large organisations to the town.

Sandvik&#x27;s UK headquarters are located here as well as Somers Forge, mFortune, SomersTotalKare and the Mucklow Group.

Communicourt are the leading providers of Non-registered Intermediaries to the criminal and family courts and its headquarters are in Halesowen.

==Transport==
Transport in the town is overseen by Transport for West Midlands, the county&#x27;s transport authority. Halesowen, as mentioned above, is no longer served by a railway station. It is however served by a fairly comprehensive bus network, and is on the Hagley Road Bus Corridor from Birmingham to Stourbridge (route 9), the Merry Hill Shopping Centre (route 002, 13, 17H, 24H, 142/142A and X10) and Dudley (route 14 
and 19). Service 4H operates from Hayley Green to Walsall via Blackheath and West Bromwich. Halesowen Bus Station is located on Queensway, next to the Asda supermarket and Job Centre Plus. Most services are operated by National Express West Midlands and Diamond Bus.

Halesowen is considered one of the largest towns in the United Kingdom without a railway station. The nearest railway stations are Rowley Regis, Stourbridge Junction, Cradley Heath and Old Hill.

==Education==
There are currently 15 primary schools, 3 secondary schools and a further education college situated within the district of Halesowen.

Newfield Park Primary School primary school located in Halesowen, was built during the 1960s to serve the expanding local area of Hawne.

In 1972, when still a borough in its own right, Halesowen Council abolished the traditional infant and junior schools and replaced them with first schools for ages 5 to 9 and middle schools for the 9 to 13 age group, but this system was abolished in 1982 and reverted to the previous infant schools for 5 to 7 year olds and junior schools for ages 7 to 11. It was one of the first instances of three-tier education being abolished in favour of a return to traditional age ranges, though most areas which adopted the system have since reverted to the traditional age ranges.

The rest of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough consisted of 5–8 first and 8–12 middle schools (barring Stourbridge and Kingswinford, which had both retained the traditional 5–7 infant and 7–11 junior schools) until following the suit of Halesowen and reverting to the traditional ranges in 1990.

<text>St Edward&#x27;s Crown is the coronation crown of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. Named after Saint Edward the Confessor, versions of it have traditionally been used to crown English and British monarchs at their coronations since the 13th century. It is normally on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.

The original crown was a holy relic kept at Westminster Abbey, Edward&#x27;s burial place, until the regalia were either sold or melted down when Parliament abolished the monarchy in 1649, during the English Civil War. The current St Edward&#x27;s Crown was made for Charles II in 1661. It is 22-carat gold, tall, weighs , and is decorated with 444 precious and fine gemstones. The crown is similar in weight and overall appearance to the original, but its arches are Baroque.

After 1689, owing to its weight the crown was not used to crown any monarch for over 200 years. In 1911, the tradition was revived by George V and has continued ever since, including at the 2023 coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

==History==

===Origin===
Edward the Confessor wore his crown at Easter, Whitsun, and Christmas. In 1161, he was canonised, and objects connected with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity for the coronations of all future English kings. Although the claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey&#x27;s part, and some of the regalia probably had been taken from Edward&#x27;s grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe. A crown referred to as St Edward&#x27;s Crown is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of Henry III in 1220, and it appears to be the same crown worn by Edward. It is believed Edward was the first English king to wear a crown with arches, known as an imperial or &quot;closed crown&quot;, symbolising subservience to no one but God, in the tradition of Byzantine emperors.

===Holy relic===
St Edward&#x27;s Crown rarely left Westminster Abbey, and there are no certain visual records of it. When Richard II was forced to abdicate in 1399, he had the crown brought to the Tower of London, where he symbolically handed it over to his successor Henry IV, saying &quot;I present and give to you this crown with which I was crowned King of England and all the rights dependent on it&quot;.

It was used in 1533 to crown the second wife of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, which was unprecedented for a queen consort. In the Tudor period, three crowns were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St Edward&#x27;s Crown, the state crown, and a &quot;rich crown&quot; made specially for the new king or queen. After the English Reformation, the new Church of England denounced the veneration of medieval relics and, starting with the coronation of Edward VI in 1547, the significance of the crown&#x27;s link to Edward the Confessor was downplayed.

During the English Civil War, Parliament melted down the crown, regarded by Oliver Cromwell as symbolic of the &quot;detestable rule of kings&quot;. The crown was described in an inventory of Charles I&#x27;s possessions as &quot;King Alfred&#x27;s Crown of gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells&quot;, weighing , valued at £3 per ounce, total value £248 10s 0d. An inscription on the lid of its box, translated from Latin, read: &quot;This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others&quot;. However, there is no evidence to support its dating from Alfred&#x27;s reign, and the crown has always been referred to as St Edward&#x27;s Crown (or Crown of St Edward) in the coronation order of service.

===Restoration===

The monarchy was restored in 1660 and in preparation for the coronation of Charles II, who had been living in exile abroad, a new St Edward&#x27;s Crown was supplied by the Royal Goldsmith, Sir Robert Vyner. It was fashioned to closely resemble the medieval crown, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the arches are decidedly Baroque. In the late 20th century, it was assumed to incorporate gold from the original St Edward&#x27;s Crown, as they are almost identical in weight, and no invoice was produced for the materials in 1661. A crown was also displayed at the lying in state of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England from 1653 until 1658. On the weight of this evidence, writer and court historian Martin Holmes, in a 1959 paper for &quot;Archaeologia&quot;, concluded that in the time of the Interregnum St Edward&#x27;s Crown was saved from the melting pot and that its gold was used to make a new crown at the Restoration.

His theory became accepted wisdom, and many books, including official guidebooks for the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, repeated his claim as fact. In 2008, new research found that a coronation crown and sceptre were made in 1660 in anticipation of an early coronation, which had to be delayed several times. Charles II&#x27;s other regalia were commissioned in 1661 after Parliament increased the budget as a token of their appreciation for the king. The crown at Cromwell&#x27;s lying in state was probably made of gilded base metal such as tin or copper, as was usual in 17th-century England; for example, a crown displayed at the funeral of James I had cost only £5 and was decorated with fake jewels.

In 1671, Thomas Blood briefly stole the crown from the Tower of London, flattening it with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it. A new monde was created for the coronation of James II, and for William III the base was changed from a circle to an oval. After the coronation of William III in 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., the Coronation Crown of George IV) or their state crown, while St Edward&#x27;s Crown usually rested on the high altar.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Edward VII intended to revive the tradition of being crowned with St Edward&#x27;s Crown in 1902, but on coronation day he was still recovering from an operation for appendicitis, and instead he wore the lighter Imperial State Crown.

Jewels were hired for use in the crown and removed after the coronation until 1911, when it was permanently set with 444 precious and semi-precious stones. Imitation pearls on the arches and base were replaced with gold beads which at the time were platinum-plated. Its band was also made smaller to fit George V, the first monarch to be crowned with St Edward&#x27;s Crown in over 200 years, reducing the crown&#x27;s overall weight from to . It was used to crown his successor George VI in 1937, and Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

On 4 June 2013, St Edward&#x27;s Crown was displayed on the high altar in Westminster Abbey at a service marking the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation, the first time it had left the Tower of London since 1953. In December 2022, the crown was removed from the Tower of London to be resized ahead of its use in the coronation of Charles III on 6 May 2023. Its circumference was enlarged by sawing the base into four pieces and welding 7mm-wide strips of gold into the gaps. Eight new gold beads were then added to the rim.

==Description==

St Edward&#x27;s Crown is 22-carat gold, measures tall, and weighs . It has four fleurs-de-lis alternating with four crosses pattée, which support two dipped arches topped by a monde and cross pattée. Its purple velvet cap is trimmed with ermine. The crown features 444 precious and fine gemstones including 345 rose-cut aquamarines, 37 white topazes, 27 tourmalines, 12 rubies, 7 amethysts, 6 sapphires, 2 jargoons, 1 garnet, 1 spinel, 1 carbuncle and 1 peridot.

==Usage==
Although St Edward&#x27;s Crown is regarded as the official coronation crown, only seven monarchs have been crowned with it since the Restoration: Charles II (1661), James II (1685), William III (1689), George V (1911), George VI (1937), Elizabeth II (1953) and Charles III (2023). Mary II and Anne were crowned with small diamond crowns of their own; George I, George II, George III and William IV with the State Crown of George I; George IV with a large new diamond crown made specially for the occasion; and Queen Victoria and Edward VII chose not to use St Edward&#x27;s Crown because of its weight and instead used the lighter 1838 Imperial State Crown. When not used to crown the monarch, St Edward&#x27;s Crown rested on the high altar; however, it did not feature at all in Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation.

==Heraldry==

After the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II based the heraldic crown on the new St Edward&#x27;s Crown of 1661. It had four crosses pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis; the number of arches was reduced to two and the curvature of the arches was depressed at the point of intersection. On this pattern the royal crown was depicted until the reign of Queen Victoria. Although Fox-Davies states that the St Edward&#x27;s Crown is supposed to be heraldically represented over the Royal Arms and other insignia because &quot;it is the &#x27;official&#x27; crown of England&quot;, various other crowns were depicted under Victoria, whose coronation, unusually, did not feature the St Edward&#x27;s Crown at all. Early depictions of the Royal Arms during her reign featured the Imperial State Crown which was created for Victoria&#x27;s coronation in 1838 and was similar to the St Edward&#x27;s Crown but with a flatter top. However, depictions varied depending on the artist.

In 1876, Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India, and in 1880, the heraldic crown was altered to give it a more imperial form by making the arches semi-circular. However, Victoria had favoured a Tudor style crown since at least the 1860s. After the accession of Edward VII, the War Office raised the issue of a standardised design of the crown for use by the British Army, there being in use several crowns of different patterns. On 4 May 1901, the king approved a single Tudor Crown design based on the crown of Henry VII, as &quot;chosen and always used by Queen Victoria personally&quot;.

George VI had ceased to use the style &quot;Emperor of India&quot; in 1948 following India&#x27;s independence in 1947, and on the accession of Elizabeth II in 1952, she opted to change from the 1901 Tudor Crown to a design resembling St Edward&#x27;s Crown, similar to that last used before the reign of Victoria.

Charles III adopted the Tudor Crown on his accession in 2022, similar to that last used under George VI but with some differences. The cap of the heraldic crowns is always represented as crimson, regardless of the colour of any actual crowns.

Crown copyright applies in perpetuity to depictions of the Royal Arms and any of its constituent parts under the royal prerogative, and The National Archives restricts rights to reproduce them. Although Crown Copyright usually expires 50 years after publication, Section 171(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 made an exception for &#x27;any right or privilege of the Crown&#x27; not written in an act of parliament, thus preserving the rights of the Crown under the unwritten royal prerogative.

In addition, use of the crowns for commercial purposes is specifically restricted in the UK (and in countries which are party to the Paris Convention) under sections 4 and 99 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and their use is governed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. It is also an offence under Section 12 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to give a false indication that any goods or services are supplied to the monarch or any member of the royal family.

<text>The Isle of Wight Festival 1970 was a music festival held between 26 and 30 August 1970 at Afton Down, an area on the western side of the Isle of Wight in England. It was the last of three consecutive music festivals to take place on the island between 1968 and 1970 and often acknowledged as the largest musical event of its time, with a larger attendance than Woodstock. Although estimates vary, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; estimated 600,000 to 700,000 people attended. It was organised and promoted by local brothers, Ron and Ray Foulk through their company Fiery Creations Ltd and their brother Bill Foulk. Ron Smith was site manager and Rikki Farr acted as compere.

The preceding Isle of Wight Festivals, also promoted by the Foulks, had already gained a good reputation in 1968 and 1969 by featuring acts such as Jefferson Airplane, Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Move, the Pretty Things, Joe Cocker, the Moody Blues (performed at the 1969 festival), the Who, and Bob Dylan in his second performance since his 1966 motorcycle accident -the first one was just three songs with The Band at a Woody Guthrie Memorial Concert.

Many excerpts from this festival have appeared on record and video.

==Artists lineup==
The 1970 version, following Woodstock in the previous year, set out to move one step forward and enlisted Jimi Hendrix. With Hendrix confirmed, artists such as Rory Gallagher, Cactus, Chicago, the Doors, Lighthouse, the Moody Blues, the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Jethro Tull, Sly and the Family Stone, Ten Years After, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and Free also took part. The event had a magnificent but impractical site, since the prevailing wind blew the sound sideways across the venue, and the sound system had to be augmented by Pink Floyd&#x27;s PA. Organizers also faced the logistical problems involved in transporting some 600,000 people onto an island with a population of fewer than 100,000. The Island&#x27;s transport services were already stretched by the annual influx of summer holiday-makers at the same time. French anarchists armed with knives were already causing trouble on the ferry crossing.

Political and logistical difficulties resulted in the organisers eventually realising that the festival would not make a profit and declaring it to be &quot;a free festival&quot;, although the majority of the audience had paid for tickets in advance, and the event was filmed contemporaneously. The commercial failings of the festival ensured it was the last event of its kind on the Isle of Wight for thirty-two years.

==Planning difficulties==
The opposition to the proposed 1970 festival from the residents of the Isle of Wight was much better coordinated than it had been in previous years. The Isle of Wight was a favoured retirement destination of the British well-heeled, and a haven of the yachting set, and many of the traditional residents deplored the huge influx of &quot;hippies&quot; and &quot;freaks&quot;. This led to the introduction of sections to the &quot;Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971&quot; designed to control any further large overnight gatherings. Renting a few acres of suitable farmland to hold a music festival had in earlier years been a simple commercial matter between the promoters and one of the local farmers, but by 1970 this had become subject to approval decisions from several local council committees who were heavily lobbied by residents&#x27; associations opposing the festival. As a result of this public scrutiny, the preferred ideal location for the third Festival was blocked, and the promoters in the end had no choice but to accept the only venue on offer by the authorities: East Afton Farm, Afton Down. One unintended result of this choice of location was that, since it was overlooked by a large hill, a significant number of people were able to watch the proceedings for free.

==Performances==
===26 Wednesday===
*Judas Jump: A heavy progressive rock band featuring Andy Bown and Henry Spinetti of the Herd and Allan Jones of Amen Corner.
*Kathy Smith: A Californian singer-songwriter, signed to Richie Havens&#x27; label, &quot;Stormy Forest&quot;, was well received. 
*Rosalie Sorrels: Another folk musician, accompanied by David Bromberg on guitar.
*David Bromberg: Bromberg was not on the bill, but he performed a set. &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; was included on the album &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot;.
*Kris Kristofferson: Performed a controversial set. Due to poor sound, the audience was unable to hear his set, and it appeared that they were jeering him. He was eventually booed off the stage because the audience could not properly hear his song &quot;Blame It on the Stones&quot; and ignorant members of the audience assumed he was criticising the Rolling Stones and the whole youth movement. &quot;It was a total disaster,&quot; Kristofferson recalled. &quot;They just hated us. They hated everything. They booed us, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Sly Stone; they threw shit at Jimi Hendrix. At the end of the night, they were tearing down the outer walls, setting fire to the concessions, burning their tents, shouting obscenities. Peace and love it was not.&quot;
*Mighty Baby: psychedelic rock band.

===27 Thursday===
*Gary Farr: The brother of festival promoter Rikki Farr, Gary had been the front man of the T-Bones, an R&amp;B combo that featured Keith Emerson on keyboards. By this time, he had become a solo artist, and his second album, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, for CBS Records, had been released in 1970.
*Supertramp: Their eponymous debut album was released a month prior to the festival.

*Arrival: Their set included a Leonard Cohen song.
*Lighthouse: This Canadian act performed two sets at the festival.
*Taste: Guitarist Rory Gallagher had a blues trio from 1966 to 1970. This was one of their final shows, which was filmed and recorded. An album, &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight&quot;, was released of their set in 1971. Their set is featured on the &quot;Taste: What&#x27;s Going on – Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot; DVD &amp; Blu-ray released in 2016.
*Tony Joe White: Performed hits including &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;; his drummer was Cozy Powell. Tony Joe&#x27;s entire set was released in 2006 on &quot;Swamp Music&quot;, a Rhino Handmade collection of his Monument recordings.
*Chicago: Their set included &quot;25 or 6 to 4,&quot; &quot;Beginnings&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Man.&quot; Their entire set was released as part of the box set &quot;Chicago: VI Decades Live (This is What We Do)&quot; (2018) and separately on &quot;Chicago: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival&quot; (2018). 
*Family: Their set included &quot;The Weaver&#x27;s Answer,&quot; which had become their signature song. 
*Procol Harum: Frontman Gary Brooker commented that it was a cold night. &quot;A Salty Dog&quot; was included on &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot; album.
*The Voices of East Harlem: An ensemble of singing school children from East Harlem in New York City. Their set received several standing ovations. 
*Cactus: Two songs from their set were featured on the LP &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot;.
*A showing of the Murray Lerner film &quot;Festival&quot;.

===29 Saturday===
*John Sebastian: Performed an 80-minute set, during which former Lovin&#x27; Spoonful guitarist Zal Yanovsky made a surprise guest appearance.
*Shawn Phillips: This American folk musician performed an impromptu solo set following John Sebastian.
*Lighthouse (second set)
*Joni Mitchell: Played a controversial set; following her performance of &quot;Woodstock&quot;, a hippie named Yogi Joe interrupted her set to make a speech about the people at the festival in an encampment built of straw bales known as Desolation Row. When Joe was hauled off by Joni&#x27;s manager, the audience began to boo until Mitchell interrupted her own set to chastise the audience and make an emotional appeal to &quot;give us [the artists] some respect&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, Joe was not the man who was ranting about a &quot;psychedelic concentration camp&quot;. That was another incident that took place the previous day. After the crowd quieted down, Mitchell closed her set with &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; and returned to the stage for an encore singing two more songs for an appreciative crowd. Her set is featured on the DVD Joni Mitchell Both Sides Now: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, released in 2018.
*Tiny Tim: His rendition of &quot;There&#x27;ll Always Be an England&quot; can be seen in the film &quot;Message to Love&quot;.
*Miles Davis: A DVD of his complete set was released in 2004. &quot;Call It Anythin&#x27;&quot; was included on &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot; album.
*Ten Years After: British blues rockers performing what was basically a reprise of their famous Woodstock set. Highlights included &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Keep From Crying Sometimes,&quot; which was featured on the album &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot; and the film &quot;Message to Love&quot;.
*Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer: This was their second gig. &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, which featured the Moog synthesizer, was the centerpiece of their historic set. Commercially released as &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970&quot; in 1997.
*The Doors: Their set was shrouded in darkness due to Jim Morrison&#x27;s unwillingness to have movie spotlights on the band. Their performances of &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;When the Music&#x27;s Over&quot; are featured in &quot;Message to Love&quot;. As described in Morrison&#x27;s biography, &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, wind, bad weather, and the cold made their performance even harder. Bootleg recordings of the performances and audio exist, alongside a 2015 remastered release by Doxy Records which has been made available on Spotify. A live version of &quot;Break On Through (To the Other Side)&quot; was featured in the soundtrack for &quot;When You&#x27;re Strange&quot;. Their set is featured on the Doors: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 in a combo DVD/CD – Blu-ray/CD &amp; DVD – Blu-ray released in 2018.
*The Who: Their entire set, including the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, was released in 1996 on CD (&quot;Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970&quot;). Two years later their set appeared on DVD with significant cuts from &quot;Tommy&quot; and a few other songs (such as &quot;Naked Eye&quot;) missing.
*Melanie: This Woodstock veteran played a well-received set as the sun rose. Prior to her set, Keith Moon of the Who offered her some moral support and encouragement. Not until afterwards did Melanie realize who he was. Her performance of her own song, &quot;What Have They Done to My Song Ma&quot;, was included in a 2010 French documentary, spanning the 1970 and 2010 I.O.W. festivals, called &quot;From Wight to Wight&quot; and first shown on TV station ARTE, on 30 July 2010.
*Sly and the Family Stone: The showstoppers of Woodstock performed to a tired audience on the early morning of Sunday. However, the audience woke up for spirited renditions of &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;, &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;, which featured Sly on guitar. &quot;Stand&quot; and &quot;You Can Make it if You Really Try&quot; appeared on the album &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot;. Prior to their encore, another political militant decided it was time to make a speech and the booing audience started to throw beer cans onto the stage. Freddie Stone was hit by a flying can and an angry Sly decided to skip the encore. He did promise a second appearance, but this never occurred.

===30 Sunday===
*Good News: American acoustic duo with Larry Gold on cello and Michael Bacon on guitar.
*Kris Kristofferson (second set). For his second set he was warmly received. He came on with a bigger band and joked when he took the stage: &#x27;Well, I&#x27;m back but this time I&#x27;ve brought some bodyguards&#x27;. Two of his songs from his sets were included on the album &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot;.
*Ralph McTell: Despite an enthusiastic reception from the audience, he did not play an encore, and the stage was cleared for Donovan.
*Heaven: British jazz-influenced rock band, managed by Rikki Farr. 
*Free: Their set list consisted of &quot;Ride on a Pony&quot;, &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;The Stealer&quot;, &quot;Be My Friend&quot;, &quot;Fire &amp; Water&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Mover&quot;, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, their classic hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;, and concluded with a cover of Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Crossroads&quot;.
*Donovan: He first performed an acoustic set, and then an electric set with his band Open Road.
*Pentangle: British folk band. A German woman interrupted their set to deliver a political message to the audience.
*The Moody Blues: A popular British act and veterans of the 1969 festival. Their rendition of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; can be seen in &quot;Message to Love&quot;. Their set is featured on &quot;Threshold of A Dream Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot;.
*Jethro Tull: Their set is featured on &quot;Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot; which also shows clashes between the band&#x27;s manager and the promoters.
*Jimi Hendrix: Performed in the early hours of 31 August with Mitch Mitchell on drums and Billy Cox on bass. Throughout Hendrix was beset by technical problems (during &quot;Machine Gun&quot; the security personnel&#x27;s radio is clearly heard through Hendrix&#x27;s amplifier). David Gilmour claims to have helped mix the sound that night. The set has been released on CD and video in various forms. &quot;Power to Love&quot;, &quot;Midnight Lightning&quot; and &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; received top billing on the album &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot;.
*Joan Baez: Her version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; can be seen in the film &quot;Message to Love&quot;.
*Leonard Cohen: Backed by his band the Army, his tune &quot;Suzanne&quot; can be seen in the film &quot;Message to Love&quot;. &quot;Tonight Will Be Fine&quot; were included on the album &quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot;. In October 2009, audio and video (both DVD and Blu-ray) recording of his set, &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot; was released.
*Richie Havens: The musician who opened Woodstock closed this festival with a set during the morning of 31 August. As Havens performed his version of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, a cloudy dawn broke after four days of cloudless sky, so he changed the lyrics to &quot;Here Comes the Dawn&quot;. Havens&#x27; set, which is available as an audience recording, also included &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot; by Bob Dylan, &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Minstrel from Gault&quot; and the Hare Krishna mantra.

==Films and albums==
===&quot;The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies&quot; (1971)===
This three-LP set on CBS Records devoted the first disk to Second Annual Atlanta International Pop Festival, and two disks to the later Isle of Wight. Teo Macero is credited as the producer for the Isle of Wight disks. It featured in order billed: Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Ten Years After, Miles Davis, Kris Kristofferson, Procol Harum, Cactus, Leonard Cohen and David Bromberg. The album went on to reach number 47 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart that same year.

===&quot;Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival&quot; ===
All the performances at the festival were professionally filmed by award-winning film director Murray Lerner. with a view to releasing a documentary film but due to financial difficulties, nothing was released until 27 years after the event. Finally, Lerner distilled material from the festival into the film &quot;Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival&quot; which was premiered at a San Jose film festival in 1995 and released in 1997. A CD of the soundtrack was also issued by Castle Communications/Sony Legacy in 1997. The film puts a negative slant on the 1970 event by splicing in footage of violent incidents preceding the festival itself. Chief Constable, Hampshire Constabulary, Sir Douglas Osmond emphasised the peaceful nature of the event in his evidence given to the Stevenson Report, 1971 (submitted to parliament as evidence in favour of future Isle of Wight Festivals). By the end of the festival, the press representatives became almost desperate for material and they seemed a little disappointed that the patrons had been so well behaved.

==Influence==
The founders/main instigators of the Glastonbury (1971), Windsor (1972–74) and Stonehenge (1974) Free Festivals were all at IOW 1970, respectively Andrew Kerr, Ubi Dwyer and Wally Hope, inspired by the anarchistic nature of the breakdown of control by the original organisation and the subsequent freedom of the last days of the event.

For the 50th anniversary of the event, a re-enactment was scheduled in the same location, with John Lodge, Ten Years After, Pentangle, The Pretty Things and Nik Turner all confirmed. However, this was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<text>Marshal of Aviation Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub (; ; 8 June 1920 – 8 August 1991) was a Soviet World War II fighter ace. Universally credited with over 60 solo victories, he is considered to be the highest scoring Soviet and Allied fighter pilot of World War II. He is one of the few pilots to have shot down a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet, and the first Soviet pilot to have done so. He was made a Hero of the Soviet Union on three occasions (4 February 1944, 19 August 1944, and 18 August 1945). After World War II, he remained in the military and went on to command the 324th Fighter Aviation Division during Soviet operations in the Korean War.

== Early life ==
Kozhedub was born on 8 June 1920 to a Ukrainian family in the village of Obrazhiivka, in Chernihiv Governorate, located within what is now Shostka Raion of Ukraine&#x27;s Sumy Oblast. After graduating from his seventh grade of school in his hometown in 1934 he went on to complete two more years of school in Shostka. There he initially worked as a librarian until completing his ninth grade of school in 1936, and from that year to 1940 he attended the Shostka Chemical Technology College. In addition to his studies, he attended training at the local aeroclub, from which he graduated in 1939. He subsequently joined the Red Army in February 1940, and in January 1941 he graduated from training at the Chuhuiv Military Aviation School of Pilots, where he initially learned to fly the UT-2, UTI-4, and I-16. Remaining at the school as a flight instructor, he continued to train pilots after the school was forced to evacuate to Shymkent in the autumn of 1941 due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was sent to Moscow in November 1942, where was posted to the 240th Fighter Aviation Regiment, but he did not arrive on the warfront until March 1943 when the 302nd Fighter Aviation Division was deployed to the Voronezh Front.

== World War II ==
Despite having started in the regiment as a regular pilot, he quickly mastered the new La-5 and was promoted to flight commander. He opened his tally on 6 July 1943 with the shootdown of a Ju 87 dive bomber. Kozhedub became friends with Kirill Yevstigneev, an accomplished flying ace; although they did not often fly together, Kozhedub acquired many of his tactics and, in a spirit of competition, they shared their experiences using different techniques. Vasily Mukhin, who often flew as Kozhedub&#x27;s wingman, also went on to become a flying ace.

Over the next few months Kozhedub steadily gained more aerial victories and a promotion to squadron commander, but in the first half of October he rapidly increased his tally with 14 shootdowns. On 10 October 1943 he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for flying 146 sorties, engaging in 27 aerial battles, and totaling 20 aerial victories; he was awarded the title on 4 February 1944.

In July 1944 the 240th Fighter Regiment was honored with the Guards designation and renamed the 178th Fighter Aviation Regiment, and Kozhedub was nominated for a second gold star for 46 aerial victories across 256 sorties. He did not stay with his regiment much longer, though, having been reassigned as the deputy commander of the 176th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, a special &quot;free-hunting&quot; regiment equipped with the new Lavochkin La-7 fighter, per the initiative of Chief Marshal of Aviation Aleksandr Novikov. There, he was rarely assigned such specific missions as escorting other aircraft or providing air support for troops, enabling him and his subordinates to tally more aerial victories. In mid-February 1945, during a free-hunting mission in an area south of Frankfurt with his wingman Dmitry Titarenko, Kozhedub shot down an Me 262 jet, thereby becoming the first Soviet pilot to do so. When Kozhedub and Titarenko encountered the Me 262, Kozhedub quickly accelerated from low to full speed; when the Me 262 banked left and slowed — spooked by tracer rounds fired by Titarenko — Kozhedub shot it down.

By the end of the war, Kozhedub tallied 330 sorties, had engaged in 120 dogfights, and had shot down 64 enemy aircraft. Having gained all his aerial victories on the La-5F, La-5FN, and La-7, he expressed his strong preference for Lavochkin fighters, and met with Semyon Lavochkin to comment on various aspects of the fighters&#x27; designs. Having been nominated for a third gold star in May 1945, he became thrice a Hero of the Soviet Union on 18 August 1945, and remained deputy commander of the 176th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Schönwalde until September that year.

Preferring short, intense attacks to stun and bring down enemy aircraft, one favorite technique he developed and used in the war involved darting at a target from below and subsequently opening fire only when extremely close. Kozhedub used this tactic very successfully against the Ju 87 dive bomber, gaining him an unsurpassed 18 shootdowns of the type (equal with Arseny Vorozheykin). However, being so risky, the manoeuvre was neither promoted nor taught to young pilots. Though never shot down throughout the war, Kozhedub did experience several close calls. He nevertheless always managed to land his airplane, regardless of damage.

==Post war era==
Upon returning to the USSR, Kozhedub attended the Air Force Academy based in Monino, graduating in May 1949. He was originally to be posted as deputy commander of the 31st Fighter Aviation Division based in Baku, but — per orders &#x27;from above&#x27; owing to his high status as a top flying ace — he was reassigned to the 324th Fighter Aviation Division. He initially served as assistant commander for flight training, but was soon promoted to command the division in November 1950. Shortly thereafter the unit was sent to China, where they initially trained Chinese and North Korean pilots. Kozhedub, despite being one of the first pilots to master the MiG-15 fighter jet back in 1949, was strictly forbidden from participating in combat sorties by order of his commanding officers. His division consisted of only two regiments (the 176th Guards and 196th Fighter Aviation Regiments) rather than the usual three. Nevertheless, pilots of his division claimed 216 aerial victories in Korea from April 1951 to February 1952, while sustaining only 27 MiG-15 losses and nine pilots killed.

Upon its return to the Soviet Union in February 1952, the 324th Fighter Division was stationed in Kaluga as an air defense unit. The following year he was promoted to the rank of major-general, and in February 1955 attended the High Command Academy, graduating in 1956. He then served as deputy head of the air force&#x27;s combat-training and frontline aviation-training directorates. Having become the 1st deputy commander of the 76th Air Army in April 1958, he visited Cuba alongside the unit&#x27;s commander Viktor Davidkov from 1962 to 1963. From 1964 to February 1971 he served as 1st deputy commander of the air force of the Moscow Military District, although he ceased flying in 1969. During his career as a pilot he totaled 1937 flight hours, piloting the Yak-3, Yak-11, Yak-17, Yak-28, MiG-15, MiG-17, MiG-21, Li-2, and Il-14 airplanes and the Mi-4 and Mi-8 helicopters. From 1971 to 1978 he served as deputy chief of combat training of the air force, and subsequently became a military advisor in the Ministry of Defense; in 1985 he was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Aviation. Beyond his military duties, he served as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 1946 to 1962 and chairman of the Federation of Aviation Sports from 1967 to 1987. He resided in Moscow for the rest of his life, where he died of a heart attack on 8 August 1991 and was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery.

* Until August 1944 Kozhedub was flying on Lavochkin La-5, after that Lavochkin La-7.

===Alleged shootdown of two USAAF P-51 fighters===
In his autobiography, Kozhedub claimed to have downed two USAAF P-51 Mustang due to a friendly fire incident on 17 April 1945. By his account, he encountered a group of American B-17 Flying Fortresses under attack by Luftwaffe aircraft. His aircraft was apparently mistaken by American escort fighters for the enemy and attacked. Kozhedub, having no other option, defended himself by shooting down two of the P-51s. The story is highly suspect. Film footage exists that had been touted as Kozhedub&#x27;s actual gun camera film from the event; however, the footage was shot using Zeiss equipment, which was used primarily by the Luftwaffe.

<doc id="401209" wikidata="Q159582" url="?curid=401209" title="Alexander Pokryshkin">
<text>Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin (; – 13 November 1985) was a Soviet fighter pilot in World War II, and later a marshal of aviation. He was one of the highest-scoring Soviet aces, and the highest-scoring pilot ever to fly an American aircraft, having achieved the great majority of his kills in the Lend-Lease Bell P-39 Airacobra. During the war Pokryshkin earned the title Hero of the Soviet Union three times: 24 May 1943, 24 August 1943, and 19 August 1944. After the war, he served in the Soviet Air Defense Forces, reaching the rank of Marshal of Aviation; he retired in 1981.

During the war, he strongly promoted training in and use of improved aerial combat techniques, such as vertical maneuvers that newer fighter aircraft were capable of carrying out, and he spent much of his time studying aerobatics for combat situations.

== Early years ==

Pokryshkin was born in Novonikolayevsk (now Novosibirsk) in Tomsk Governorate, son of a Russian peasant-turned-factory worker. He grew up in a poor, crime-ridden part of town, but unlike most of his peers he was more interested in learning than in fighting and petty crime. His nickname in his early teens was &quot;Engineer&quot;. He caught the &quot;aviation bug&quot; when he was 12 years old at a local air show, and the dream never left him. In 1928, after seven years of school, he found work as a construction worker. In 1930, despite his father&#x27;s protests, he left home and entered a local technical college, where he received a degree in 18 months and worked for six more as a steel worker at a local munitions factory. Subsequently, he volunteered for the army and was sent to an aviation school. His dream finally seemed to be coming true. Unfortunately the flight school was suddenly closed, and all students were instead transferred to be trained as aircraft mechanics. Dozens of official requests were denied with a simple explanation: &quot;Soviet aviation needs mechanics just as badly&quot;.

Pokryshkin still strived to excel as a mechanic. Graduating in 1933, he quickly rose through the ranks. By December 1934, he became the Senior Aviation Mechanic of the 74th Rifle Division. He stayed in that capacity until November 1938. During that time his creative nature became clearly visible: he invented improvements to the ShKAS machine gun and the R-5 reconnaissance aircraft among other things.

Finally, during his vacation in the winter of 1938, Pokryshkin was able to circumvent the authorities by passing a yearly civilian pilot program in only 17 days. This automatically made him eligible for flight school. Without even packing a suitcase, he boarded a train to flight school. He graduated with top honors in 1939, and with the rank of senior lieutenant he was assigned to the 55th Fighter Regiment.

== World War II ==

=== Early experiences ===

He was stationed in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in June 1941, close to the border, and his airfield was bombed on 22 June, the first day of the war.

His first involvement in air combat was a disaster. Seeing an aircraft in the air of a type he had never seen before, he attacked and shot it down, only to notice as it was going down that it had Soviet red stars on the wings. It was a Soviet Su-2 light bomber of the 211th Bomber Aviation Regiment, piloted by squadron commander Mikhail Gudzenko. This was a new bomber type that was kept secret even from other Soviet pilots. He then frantically flew in front of all the other MiG-3 pilots who were lining up on the other Sukhoi bombers, thwarting any other Soviet losses by other pilots of his unit. Luckily, Gudzenko survived, although the navigator was killed.

He claimed his first shootdown of an enemy aircraft when he shot down a Bf 109 the next day, while he and his wingman were on a reconnaissance mission, and were jumped by five enemy fighters. On 3 July, having claimed several more victories, he was shot down by German flak behind enemy lines and spent four days getting back to his unit. During the first weeks of the war, Pokryshkin began to see very clearly how outdated the Soviet combat doctrine was, and started slowly drafting his own ideas in his meticulous notebooks. He carefully recorded all details of all air engagements in which he and all his friends were involved, and came up with detailed analysis of each. He fought in very complicated conditions: constant retreat, poor- to no-controlling and communication from HQ, and overwhelming odds versus a superior opponent. He later said &quot;one who hasn&#x27;t fought in 1941–1942 has not truly tasted war&quot;.

Pokryshkin survived several close calls during this time. A machine gun round drove through the right side of the cockpit, cut his shoulder straps, ricocheted off the left side and scratched his chin, covering the entire windscreen in blood. Twice, unexploded bombs landed between his feet, one time during a dramatic low-level raid on his airfield by a pair of Ju 88s. Pokryshkin tried to defend his fighter, one of the very few remaining serviceable aircraft, by removing a flexible machine gun from the nearby bomber and placing it on top of his fighter&#x27;s fuselage. One of the German bombers saw Pokryshkin firing the only machine gun in the area and flew straight at him, dropping small bombs in a shallow dive. Pokryshkin watched a string of explosions running up to him, but the bomb that landed immediately next to him did not explode. The Ju 88 had dropped it too low; the bomb had insufficient time to arm itself before hitting the ground.

In the autumn of 1941 Pokryshkin, flying a MiG-3 (possibly winter-camouflaged), took off in sleet and rain conditions after two other pilots had crashed on takeoff. His mission was to locate von Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Group, which had been stopped in front of Shakhty, and then their position lost by the Soviet forces. After some time flying at low altitude, low on gasoline, in bad weather, he finally found them, and was able to return safely to base with this critical information. For the successful completion of this mission, he was awarded the Order of Lenin.

When the German summer offensive of 1942 began, part of 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment had been re-equipped with the Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter, including Pokryshkin&#x27;s squadron. In that period Pokryshkin flew missions escorting Su-2 and Il-2 Shturmovik aircraft, and frequently was engaged by German fighters. On 17 July 1942, during a dogfight with Bf 109s, he became separated from his wingman Konstantin Figichov, and was jumped by a &quot;Rotte&quot; of Bf 109G-2 &quot;Gustavs&quot; flown by the &quot;experte Feldwebel&quot; Hans Dammers and his wingman &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Kurt Keiser (7./JG 52). Initially Pokryshkin dived to escape, but realizing that the heavier and faster Gustavs would catch him, he performed a chandelle and then a barrel roll. This caused the Germans to overshoot, and then Pokryshkin shot down (and killed) Keiser at short range. Dammers attacked Pokryshkin shortly afterwards, damaging his Yak-1. But once more Pokryshkin performed a barrel roll, forced Dammers to slide forward, and then shot down the German ace.

In the late summer of 1942, his regiment was recalled from the front lines to convert to a new fighter type, the Bell P-39 Airacobra. While training in the rear, Pokryshkin frequently clashed with the regiment&#x27;s new commander, Isayev (the former regimental navigator), who could not stand his criticism of Soviet air combat doctrine. Isayev fabricated a court-martial case, accusing Pokryshkin of cowardice, insubordination, and disobeying orders. Pokryshkin was grounded, removed from the regiment&#x27;s headquarters, and had his Party membership cancelled. However, he was helped by his squadron mates, the regimental political commissar, and the divisional commanders, and he was soon vindicated. The 216 Fighter Aviation Division&#x27;s leadership dismissed the case against him, and had him reinstated.

=== Kuban ===
Pokryshkin&#x27;s most significant contribution to the war effort and the most impressive kill record came during the battle for the Kuban region in 1943. The area east of the Crimean peninsula had seen vicious air combat in the months that led to the Soviet assault on Crimea itself, where the Kuban-based Soviet air regiments flew against Crimea-based Luftwaffe Geschwader. Pokryshkin&#x27;s regiment fought against such renowned German fighter units as JG 52 and JG 3 &#x27;Udet&#x27;. The area saw some of the most fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, with daily engagements of up to 200 aircraft in the air. Pokryshkin&#x27;s innovative tactics of using different fighter types stacked in altitude, the so-called &#x27;pendulum&#x27; flight pattern for patrolling the airspace, and the use of ground-based radar, forward based controllers, and an advanced central ground control system, contributed to the first great Soviet Air Force victory over the Luftwaffe.

In the summer of 1942, the 4th Air Army in which Pokryshkin served received their first mobile radar stations. They were tested in directing interceptions of German and Romanian aircraft over water, and they proved highly successful.

In early January 1943, 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was sent to 25th Depot Fighter Aviation Regiment, a unit tasked with checking that Soviet-made and Lend-Lease aircraft were ready for combat service near the Iranian border, to re-equip with new aircraft, and also to receive new pilots. Many of these planes had to be ferried in from Iran. Whilst there were delays in assembly by the Americans in Iran, the Soviet pilots involved felt that the Americans were willfully impeding the war effort It was at this time that the unit converted to the P-39 Airacobra which, when all had arrived, transformed the unit into a 3-squadron regiment. 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment received 14 P-39L-1s, seven P-39Ks (the very last of which was assigned to Pokryshkin) and 11 P-39D-2s. The unit returned to action on 8 April 1943. During the remainder of the month, Pokryshkin was credited with 11 Bf 109s and one Ju 88 destroyed.

He was credited with a Bf 109 destroyed on his very first Airacobra mission, on 9 April 1943, and scored four Bf 109 kills on 12 April 1943, one of his more successful days. He scored again on 15, 16, 20, 21, and 24 April – one Bf 109 on each day, adding a Ju 88 (probably in fact an He 111) on 29 April, plus one more Bf 109 on 30 April.

On 4 May 1943 Pokryshkin gained three confirmed kills two Ju 87 and a Bf 109.

In most subsequent fights, Pokryshkin would usually take the most difficult role, attacking the German flight leader, who was often an aggressive &quot;experte&quot;. He had learned in 1941–42 that shooting down the flight leader would demoralise the enemy and often cause them to scramble home. Taking that into account, several such &quot;experten&quot; were almost certainly among his kills during the month of May that year. On 6 May 1943 Pokryshkin shot down a Bf 109, probably the plane of 9-kills ace &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Heinz Scholze (4./JG 52), who crashed while trying to land at Kuteinikovo. Two days later, his victim may have been the Bf 109G-4 of &quot;Leutnant&quot; Helmut Haberda (an &quot;experte&quot; of 5./JG 52 with 58 victories to his credit), though the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; credited the loss to Soviet flak.

Pokryshkin received his first &#x27;Hero of the Soviet Union&#x27; award on 24 May 1943, and was promoted to major in June, having become commanding officer of his squadron. On 23 June, he exchanged his old P-39K-1 USAAF Serial Number 42-4421, &quot;White 13&quot;, for the famous P-39N USAAF S.N. 42-9004, &quot;White 100&quot;. He flew aircraft designated 100 for the rest of the war, such as P-39N-5 42-19185, after 42-9004 was damaged in August or September 1943, except for the test of the Berlin autobahn as a runway in Konstantin Sukhov&#x27;s &quot;White 50&quot;, which was much photographed.

=== The Campaign in Ukraine ===
In mid-July the 216 Fighter Aviation Division (then redesignated 9 Guards Fighter Aviation Division) was deployed in southern Ukraine to help take the Donbass area. There he continued to defeat German aces – on 23 July 1943 Pokryshkin shot down the 56-kills &quot;experte&quot; &quot;Uffz.&quot; Hans Ellendt, of 4./JG 52.

Occasionally his P-39s also escorted the Pe-2 bombers. In that role, he used his nickname &quot;Sotka&quot; (&quot;One Hundred&quot;) – his radio call sign), because he knew very well that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ordered its airmen to stay on the ground if they knew he was in the air. A Pe-2 pilot of the 36 Bomber Aviation Regiment, Timofey P. Puniov, recalled that because of the heavy casualties inflicted by the German fighters, the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was tasked to escort them. Puniov clearly remembers that twice Pokryshkin violated radio silence saying openly in the frequency: &quot;Vnimanie! Ya – sotka. Poedu na rabotu!&quot; (Attention! I&#x27;m &quot;100&quot;. I&#x27;m going to work!). Neither on those two occasions nor after did the German fighters try to intercept the 36th Bomber Aviation Regiment.

On 20 August, Isaev, who had been the Unit Navigator, and then Commanding Officer, and with whom Pokryshkin had strong differences, took measures to have Pokryshkin stripped of his Hero of the Soviet Union, expelled from the regiment, and hauled before a tribunal. From 10 PM that night at least through the following day, Pokryshkin, 298th Fighter Aviation Regiment&#x27;s Major Taranyenko, and the 16th Guards&#x27; Commissar, Gubarevim, and some &quot;Osobists&quot; (NKVD people) completed interrogations and investigations. Gubarevim, with difficulty, was able to clear Pokryshkin&#x27;s name and reputation, and &quot;Sasha&quot; was thereupon awarded his second Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 August 1943.

On 21 September 1943, Pokryshkin was involved in another high-profile air engagement. This one happened at low altitudes right over the front line. It was witnessed by dozens of journalists and representatives of the high command. Pokryshkin shot down three Junkers Ju 88s in a single pass, overcome by hatred, as he had just found out that the entire family of Zhmud, his mechanic, had been killed in German-occupied territories. Only two kills were confirmed, the third Ju 88 being recorded as brought down by the explosion of the second one and not because of Pokryshkin&#x27;s gunfire. All three Junkers are confirmed by German loss records – they were Ju 88A-4s of 5./RummKGr. Earlier that same day Pokryshkin had added two more Junkers Ju 87s to his tally, almost certainly Ju 87D-5s of 6./StG 1.

=== 1944–1945 ===
In February 1944, Pokryshkin was offered a promotion and an easy desk job managing new pilot training. He immediately rejected this offer, and stayed at his old regiment and his old rank. However, he did not fly nearly as much as before. Pokryshkin had been made a famous hero by the propaganda machine, and he was not allowed to fly as often because of fear of him being killed. Instead, Pokryshkin spent a lot of time in the radio bunker, directing his regiment&#x27;s fights over the radio. In June 1944, Pokryshkin was promoted to colonel and given command of 9th Guards Air Division.

On 19 August 1944, for 550 front-line sorties and 53 official kills, Pokryshkin was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union for the third time. He was the first person to receive the award three times, and he is the only Soviet soldier to receive the award three times during wartime. Pokryshkin was forbidden to fly altogether, but managed to circumvent the rule a few times and still continued to score an occasional kill.

One of such occasions occurred on 30 May 1944 near Jassy, Romania. The whole 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment engaged a large formation of Ju 87s heading towards the Soviet ground forces escorted by Fw 190s and Bf 109s. In the ensuing &quot;melée&quot;, the Airacobra pilots claimed to shoot down five Stukas, three Focke-Wulfs and one Messerschmitt without losses – three Ju 87s were shot down by Pokryshkin himself. At some point during May of 1944, Pokryshkin met with Mikhail Devyataev, who later became famous for his escape with nine other Soviet POWs from a Nazi concentration camp in Peenemünde, Usedom. The next time Pokryshkin scored victories was on 16 July, when he got credit for two more Stukas and one Hs 129 of 10.(Pz)/SG 9, probably the Henschel Hs 129B-2 of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Rudolf-Heinz Ruffer, credited with 80 tank-kills. His last victory was another Ju 87, downed on 14 January 1945.

Out of his official score of 65 victories, only six were scored in the last two years of the war. The bulk of Pokryshkin&#x27;s victories came during the time when the Soviet Air Force was still fighting at a disadvantage, and he was among the most successful Soviet pilots during the most difficult first year of the war.

In the Victory Parade, Pokryshkin participated as the standard bearer of the 1st Ukrainian Front.

== After the war ==

In 1948 he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy. in 1949–1955 he acted as deputy commander of the 33rd Fighter Air Defense Corps and commander of the 88th Fighter Aviation Corps in Rzhev. He was repeatedly passed-over for promotion, possibly because he was just too intelligent (or honest) for Stalin&#x27;s comfort. Only after Stalin&#x27;s death did he find himself back in favor and finally promoted to Marshal of Aviation.

In 1957 he graduated from the General Staff Academy. After graduation he served as Chief of Fighter Aircraft of the North Caucasian Military Defense. From 1959, he served in the 8th Independent Air Defense Army Air (Kiev), and from 1961 to 1968 acted as Commanding General of the 8th Army Air Defense and deputy commander of the Kiev Military District Air Defense Forces. In 1968 he became Deputy Chief of the Air Defense Forces.

His highest position was as president of DOSAAF (1972–1981), a mostly civilian organization that was largely tasked with training young civilians and preparing them for service with the Air Force. Pokryshkin again found himself ostracized for his honesty. Despite strong pressure, he never wrote about or supported glorification of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s role in the battle of Kuban, where Brezhnev was a minor general. Pokryshkin died on 13 November 1985 at the age of 72, and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery. In Novosibirsk, a street, a square, and a subway station are named in his honor.

He wrote several books in Russian about his wartime experiences. He appeared in the documentary TV Series &quot;The Unknown War&quot;, in episode 9, entitled &quot;War in the Air&quot;, and, at the beginning and end of the episode, he spoke to the host and narrator, Burt Lancaster.

There are two Soviet-made documentaries about Alexander Pokryshkin: &quot;Pokryshkin in the Sky&quot; (1945), and &quot;Russian Ace Alexander Pokryshkin&quot; (1985).

== Aircraft flown by Pokryshkin ==
Pokryshkin started the war flying the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighter, in which he scored almost twenty victories. The unit was given the honor &quot;16th Guards Fighter Regiment&quot; in March 1942. At this time or soon after, the unit received some Yak-1s, in which Pokryshkin also scored victories, but which are neither identified, nor illustrated, in any known way. In January 1943, his regiment converted to Lend-Lease Bell P-39 Airacobras. Soviet pilots liked this aircraft, and found it quite competitive with the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and superior to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 at the low air combat altitudes common on the Eastern Front. Pokryshkin enjoyed the 37 mm cannon&#x27;s destructive firepower, as well as the two upper nose-mounted .50 caliber machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propeller (airscrew), in addition to the pair of .30 caliber machine guns mounted in each wing. He claimed that the cannon&#x27;s trigger, positioned at the top of the joystick, was impossible to push without moving the pilot&#x27;s hand, which made the aircraft deviate from the gunsight, so finally he had his regiment&#x27;s aircraft rigged so that a single button simultaneously fired cannon and machine guns. In his memoirs he describes many enemy aircraft immediately disintegrating upon being hit by a salvo. Pokryshkin and his regiment were repeatedly asked to convert to new Soviet fighters such as the La-5 and Yak-3. However, Pokryshkin found the Yak-3&#x27;s firepower insufficient, and personally disliked Yakovlev, so the squadron remained with the P-39.

Finally, in 1944, he found an aircraft that he deemed a worthy heir: the Lavochkin La-7. However, one of his close friends, Soviet ace Alexander Klubov, was killed in a landing mishap while converting to the La-7. The crash was blamed on the malfunction of the plane&#x27;s hydraulic system. Pokryshkin subsequently cancelled his regiment&#x27;s conversion, and there are multiple reports that they instead began flying the Bell P-63 Kingcobra. Through the Lend-Lease agreement with United States, the Soviet Union was not allowed to use P-63s against Germany; they were given only to be used in the eventual battle with Japan. Thus it is quite understandable that no mention of this appears in any official records. However, personal accounts of German pilots and flak crewmen include encounters with P-63s in the skies of eastern Prussia, and P-63 operations are mentioned in the memoirs of a pilot in Pokryshkin&#x27;s squadron. It is reported that 9th Fighter Aviation Division was given approximately 36 P-63s but these were not used while the fighting was still in progress.

The designations of MiG-3 aircraft used by Pokryshkin were, in the likeliest order of use, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;White-5&quot; (with &quot;GVARDIYA&quot; on the intakes – likely dating to when the unit was awarded this designation), and finally &quot;67&quot;. He then flew Yak-1 fighters when the unit partially re-equipped with them.

He flew P-39K-1 &quot;White-13&quot; 42-4421 over the Kuban. He converted in late June to P-39N-0 42-9004 &quot;White 100&quot;. &quot;White 100&quot; was damaged in August or September 1943. The only known photograph of 42-9004 dates from around this time: it shows the nose resting on a saw horse with the nose wheel main leg hyper-extended so the nose wheel rests on the ground. According to a VVS color scheme research website, 42-9004 was struck by inadvertent gunfire from a badly damaged Il-2 that had a rough landing, and on one of its last bounces the guns went off and, among other things, the gunfire struck, such as the aircrew dugout, hit the parked Airacobra.

About this time Pokryshkin changed to P-39N-5 42-19158 (or possibly a different N-5). which was also designated &quot;White-100&quot;. (This is according to the document for an award to an aircraft mechanic assigned to 42-19158, for keeping it airworthy and ready to fly combat missions for 100 flights in a row.) On 28 May 1943, Pokryshkin flew P-39D-2 41-38520 (&quot;White-17&quot;) for a single mission. There is a photo of him post-mission bending to remove his parachute straps in front of the nose of 41-38520. In the famous photo taken of him using a stretch of German &quot;autobahn&quot; as a runway, he was flying a P-39Q-15 designated &quot;White-50&quot;, with the serial number painted out (the same aircraft was originally assigned to K. V. Sukhov).

He used five La-7 aircraft with the inscription, &quot;From the Workers of Novosibirsk to Hero of the Soviet Union Alexander Ivanovich Pokhryshkin&quot;, but did not fly in them himself. A La-7-equipped unit was, in 1945, made a part of the 9th Guards Division, making it a four-regiment division. At one point in 1944, he was apparently given a La-5FN for his personal use, pending the hoped-for Lavochkin conversion of the entire unit.

The unit apparently flew P-63A or C Kingcobras after the war, and Pokryshkin would have again numbered his aircraft &quot;100&quot;. Finally, one or more of the 9th Guards Fighter Division units may have eventually converted to the Yak-9P before his attendance at the War College in 1948. After his appointment as DOSAAF director in the early 1950s, he had use of a MiG-15, and, later, of an Il-12 or Il-14.

== Final tally ==
Pokryshkin&#x27;s score is heavily disputed among historians. Overclaiming was not uncommon in World War II, and Pokryshkin&#x27;s claims in his memoir are much higher than recent estimates by historians and official records, and recent estimates are generally lower than older estimates. In 1986 Oleg Levchenko claimed that Pokryshkin in fact shot down 94 enemy aircraft, damaged 19 and destroyed three more on the ground, and said that no less than 15 victories scored in 1941 were not taken into account, because the documents confirming them were destroyed during the hurried withdrawal from encirclement during the Battle of Uman. However, Levchenko&#x27;s claims are generally disputed in 21st century estimates, which tend to place Pokryshkin&#x27;s tally in the mid 40s. Thomas Polak and Christopher Shores credited him with 53 solo and 6 shared victories in their 1999 book, however the bibliography of the book cites Pokryshkin&#x27;s memoirs instead of any official documents, and the tallies of several other aviators are heavily inflated to match the official Soviet claims. Russian historian Mikhail Bykov credited him with 43 individual and 3 shared victories in a 2014 book; a decade earlier, in an article titled &quot;Мутное Небо 1941 года&quot; (&quot;The Murky Sky of 1941&quot;) with Aleksandr Rodionov he claimed that Pokryshkin tried to steal Rechkalov&#x27;s kills during 1941. Andrey Simonov and Nikolai Bodrikhin credited him with 45 solo and 4 shared shootdowns in a 2017 book.

<doc id="401210" wikidata="Q1358618" url="?curid=401210" title="Imperial State Crown">
<text>The Imperial State Crown is the state crown of the British monarch. Based on the design of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Crown of 1838, which had fallen into disrepair, it was made in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI. The crown remains in use today at coronations and State Openings of Parliament. It is adorned with 3,170 precious stones, including the Cullinan II diamond, St Edward&#x27;s Sapphire, the Stuart Sapphire, and the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby (a large red spinel).

==History==
===Origins===
St Edward&#x27;s Crown, used to crown English monarchs, was considered to be a holy relic, kept in the saint&#x27;s shrine at Westminster Abbey and therefore not worn by monarchs at any other time. Instead, a &quot;great crown&quot; with crosses and fleurs-de-lis, but without arches (an open crown), was a king&#x27;s usual headgear at state occasions until the time of Henry V, who is depicted wearing an imperial crown of state with gold arches (a closed crown). Arches were a symbol of sovereignty, and by this point in history, the king of England was being celebrated as – an emperor of his own domain – subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers, who owed fealty to more powerful kings or to the Holy Roman Emperor.

Henry VII or his son and successor Henry VIII commissioned a more elaborate state crown, now known as the Tudor Crown, which is first described in detail in an inventory of royal jewels in 1521, and again in 1532, 1550, 1574, and 1597, and was included in a painting by Daniel Mytens of Charles I in 1631. The Tudor Crown had more pearls and jewels than its medieval predecessor, and the centre petals of each of the fleurs-de-lis had images of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and St George. The crown weighed (7 lb 6 oz troy) and was set with 168 pearls, 58 rubies, 28 diamonds, 19 sapphires, and 2 emeralds. Following the abolition of the monarchy and the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Tudor Crown was broken up by order of Oliver Cromwell during the Interregnum, and its valuable components were sold for £1,100.

Upon the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, a new state crown was made for Charles II by Sir Robert Vyner. About 10 versions of the state crown have existed since the Restoration, including the State Crown of George I, made in 1714. George IV had wished his own coronation crown of 1821 to be purchased by parliament and used for state occasions but it was judged too expensive.

===Imperial State Crown of Queen Victoria===

For the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, a new and lighter imperial state crown was created, and this is the basis for today&#x27;s crown. Made by Rundell and Bridge using old and new jewels, it had a crimson velvet cap with ermine border and a lining of white silk. It weighed and was decorated with 1,363 brilliant-cut, 1,273 rose-cut and 147 table-cut diamonds, 277 pearls, 17 sapphires (including St Edward&#x27;s Sapphire, thought to have been taken from the Confessor&#x27;s ring when his body was reinterred at Westminster Abbey in 1163), 11 emeralds, 4 rubies, and the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby (a cabochon red spinel).

At the State Opening of Parliament in 1845, the Duke of Argyll was carrying the crown before Queen Victoria when it fell off the cushion and broke. Victoria wrote in her diary, &quot;it was all crushed and squashed like a pudding that had sat down&quot;. Victoria had a small crown made in 1870, which resembled the Tudor Crown, declining to wear the 1838 crown which she found heavy and uncomfortable. In 1909, the larger crown was altered to accommodate the Cullinan II diamond, also known as the Second Star of Africa.

===1937 Imperial State Crown===
A faithful copy of the 1838 crown, which had fallen into a poor state of repair, was made in 1937 by the jewellers Garrard &amp; Co. for George VI. The crown&#x27;s inner headband was adjusted and its arches lowered by in 1953 for Queen Elizabeth II. The empty frame of Victoria&#x27;s crown survives in the Royal Collection, and is now on display in the Tower Jewel House, minus its monde and cross which now sit on the current crown.

==Description==

The Imperial State Crown is 31.5 cm (12.4 in) tall and weighs 1.06 kg (2.3 lb), and has four fleurs-de-lis alternating with four crosses pattée, supporting two arches topped by a monde and cross pattée. Its purple velvet cap is trimmed with ermine. The frame is made of gold, silver and platinum, and decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 269 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies.

Notable stones are St Edward&#x27;s Sapphire on the top cross, reputedly taken from the ring of Edward the Confessor when he was re-interred at Westminster Abbey in 1163, and the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby (a large spinel) on the front cross. In 1909, the 104-carat (21 g) Stuart Sapphire, set in the front of the crown, was moved to the back and replaced by the 317-carat (63 g) Cullinan II. Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Queen Elizabeth I, but this association is almost certainly erroneous.

==Usage==

The crown is worn by the monarch on leaving Westminster Abbey at the end of his or her coronation. It is usually also worn at State Openings of Parliament, although Elizabeth II wore a hat in March 1974, June 2017 and December 2019 after snap general elections, and in May 2021; and, in October 2019 she wore the State Diadem, while the Imperial State Crown was carried beside her. Usually, it is taken to the Palace of Westminster under armed guard in its own carriage and placed in the Robing Room, where the monarch dons the Robe of State and puts on the crown before giving the speech to Parliament. If a State Opening occurs before a coronation, the crown is placed on a cushion beside the monarch. In 1689, one week after being proclaimed king, William III wore his crown in Parliament to pass the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689. When not in use, the Imperial State Crown is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.

<doc id="401212" wikidata="Q488063" url="?curid=401212" title="Anatoly Lyapidevsky">
<text>Anatoly Vasilyevich Lyapidevsky (; 23 March 1908 – 29 April 1983) was a Soviet aircraft pilot and one of the first people to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union (in June 1934). A graduate of the Soviet Air Force Academy, he reached the rank of Major general of the Soviet Air Force at 1946.

== Birth and youth ==
Anatoly Lyapidevsky was born on March 23 (10), 1908 in the Belaya Glina village in Stavropol Governorate (now Krasnodar Krai) in the family of a clergyman. His family is of a dynasty of clergymen from Tula Governorate. At childhood he dwelt at Staroshcherbinovskaya stanitsa, later at Yeysk. Lyapidevsky worked as an apprentice in a smithy, apprentice of a metalworker, an engineman of a mowing machine, driver assistant at an oil mill.

In 1926 he was conscripted into the Red Army. In 1927 Anatoly has graduated from Leningrad Military Theory School of the Air Force, in 1928 – from Sevastopol School of Naval Pilots. Lyapidevsky served in a frontline unit of Naval Aviation of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet, then as an instructor pilot at Yeysk School of Naval Pilots. He was discharged in 1933.

==Pilot==
He worked as a pilot with the Far Eastern department of the Civil Air Fleet. Lyapidevsky took part in an aerial search and rescue operation for the crew of the steamship &quot;Chelyuskin&quot;, under extremely difficult conditions, after it was sunk in Arctic waters after February 13, 1934.

==Rescue==
Together with six other pilots, Lyapidevsky rescued 104 people from the wrecked freighter. The rescue operation took two months, as survivors waited to be rescued on ice floes. Lyapidevsky personally made 29 scouting flights despite blizzards. Lyapidevsky made his first landing on one of the floes on March 5. It was a great feat of flying. Not only was the weather horrid but the floe was only 500 by 1,300 feet. Lyapidevsky took off from the floe with 10 women and 2 children on board his plane. He flew the stranded people from their makeshift airstrip on the floating ice field of the Chukchi Sea to the town of Uelen. Lyapidevsky was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for this deed on April 20, 1934. After the Gold Star medals had appeared, on November 4, 1939 No.1 medal was handed over to him.

The heroics of the fliers in the Chelyuskin Rescue prompted the government to create the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The title later became the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest military honor.

== After the feat ==

In 1935 Lyapidevsky returned to the Army. In 1939 he graduated from the Department of Engineering of Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. Beginning in 1939, he was the deputy of the head of the Main Inspectorate of People&#x27;s Commissariat of Aviation Industry and head of Aviation Factory No.156 (Moscow, after October 1941 – Omsk).

Lyapidevsky participated in World War II. From May to September 1942 he was head of 4th Department of the Air Force Research Institute, from September 1942 to September 1943 he took the position of Deputy Commander of Air Force of 19th Army, then head of field repair service of 7th Air Army (Karelian Front).

In 1943 Lyapidevsky returned to his work as head of an aviation factory. After the end of the war, he worked as the main inspector of Ministry of State Control, deputy of Minister of Aviation Industry. From 1949 to 1954 Lyapidevsky was head of Factory No.25 of Ministry of Aviation Industry. After in May 1954 the factory was handed over to Ministry of Medium Machine Building, he was the first deputy of the head of Design Bureau-25 and head of Experimental Factory No.25 (now All-Russian Research Institute of Automation). From 1962 to 1983 he was the lead constructor, the deputy of the main engineer of Mikoyan Design Bureau. Major-General Lyapidevsky was discharged in 1961.

He died on April 29, 1983, after catching a cold at the funeral of Vasily Molokov. Lyapidevsky is buried in Moscow, at Novodevichy Cemetery. 

== Memory ==

* In 1935 a postmark was issued to commemorate Lyapidevsky&#x27;s deed.
*Streets in numerous Russian towns have been named after him.
*Omsk Flight and Technical College of Civil Aviation is named after Lyapidevsky.
*Three schools in Russia are named after Anatoly Lyapidevsky.

<text>The June 1927 Irish general election was to elect the 5th Dáil held on Thursday, 9 June following the dissolution of the 4th Dáil on 23 May 1927. It was the first election contested by Fianna Fáil, which had been formed a year earlier when Éamon de Valera, leader of the abstentionist Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, failed to convince the party to take their seats if and when the Oath of Allegiance were abolished. Most of Sinn Féin&#x27;s TDs, as well as the bulk of its support, shifted to Fianna Fáil. The impact of this shift saw Sinn Féin all but decimated; it was reduced to five seats. This was for many years the end of the party as a major force in the southern part of the island; it would not win more than 10 seats at an election until 2011, by which time it had undergone fundamental transformation. This election cemented Fianna Fáil as a major party; it and Cumann na nGaedheal/Fine Gael remained the two largest parties in Ireland until 2020 when Sinn Féin came first in first preference votes (tied with Fianna Fáil in seats).

The 5th Dáil assembled at Leinster House on 23 June to nominate the President of the Executive Council and Executive Council of the Irish Free State for appointment by the Governor-General. W. T. Cosgrave was re-appointed leading a government of Cumann na nGaedheal.

Fianna Fáil took the oath of allegiance and its seats in the Dáil on 12 August 1927. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s decision to take up its seats ended Cumann na nGaedheal&#x27;s working majority, forcing Cosgrave into a minority government which proved unstable. After government victories in two by-elections, Cosgrave sought a dissolution on 25 August and a second election of that year was held in September 1927.

<text>The 1923 Irish general election to elect the 4th Dáil was held on Monday, 27 August, following the dissolution of the Third Dáil on 9 August 1923. It was the first general election held since the establishment of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. The election was held shortly after the end of the Irish Civil War in May 1923. Many of the Republican TDs, who represented the losing anti-Treaty side, were still imprisoned during and after the election and had committed to not participating in the Dáil if elected.

The 4th Dáil assembled at Leinster House on 19 September to nominate the President of the Executive Council and Executive Council of the Irish Free State for appointment by the Governor-General. Cumann na nGaedheal, the successor to the Pro-Treaty wing of Sinn Féin, won the election and formed the government. Despite falling 14 seats of an outright majority, the opposition Republican TDs refused to take their seats, giving CnG effective control of the chamber and allowing it to form what amounted to a majority government.

==Legal background==
It was the first general election fought since the establishment of the Irish Free State and the adoption of the Constitution of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. It was contested under the Electoral Act 1923, which increased the seats in the Dáil from 128 to 153, and introduced a franchise of all citizens over the age of 21, without distinction of sex. Lax electoral practices were tightened up by The Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act 1923.

==Result==






Most parties made gains, in part because the total number of seats in the Dáil was increased by 25 from 128 to 153.

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
==Government formation==
The Republican TDs continued to abstain from the Dáil. Therefore, Cumann na nGaedheal had a majority of seats which were taken in the Dáil and formed the 2nd Executive Council of the Irish Free State on 19 September 1923.

<text>Sigizmund Aleksandrovich Levanevsky (, ; – 13 August 1937) was a Soviet pioneer of long-range flight who was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1934 for his role in the SS &quot;Chelyuskin&quot; rescue.

== Life and career ==
Sigizmund Levanevsky was born to a Polish family in Saint Petersburg on . His brother Józef Lewoniewski (1899-1933) was a Polish military and sports pilot. Sigizmund took part in the October Revolution on the Bolshevik side and later participated in the Russian Civil War, serving in the Red Army since 1918. In 1925 he graduated from the Sevastopol Naval Aviation School and became a military pilot. In 1930 he was withdrawn to reserve. From 1932 to 1933 he was head of flight and training unit of All-Ukraine Pilot School.

In 1933 Levanevsky became a pilot for the Glavsevmorput&#x27; (Main Northern Maritime Route&#x27;s Administration) - providing ice reconnaissance for shipping convoys in the eastern part of the northeast passage. At July 20, 1933 he achieved his first international fame, evacuating from Anadyr to Nome the American pilot Jimmie Mattern who had crash landed to the west of Anadyr during his attempt to break the record for a solo flight around the world.

The following year Levanevsky and fellow-pilot Mavriky Slepnyov traveled to Alaska to obtain a pair of Consolidated Fleetster 17AF transport planes for use in the aerial rescue efforts for the passengers of the crushed steamship Chelyuskin. During the March 24th flight from Nome, Levanevsky&#x27;s plane was forced down at Kolyuchin Bay on the north Chukotka coast and during landing its skis were ripped off. Slepnyov evacuated him to the operations base at Vankarem but without a plane Levanevsky did not participate in the rescue efforts. However, he would later shuttle a doctor from Uelen to Saint Lawrence Bay at Chukotka for emergency attention for Bobrov, deputy head of the expedition, who suffered from appendicitis - for which he was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1934 he became member of the Communist Party.

== North Pole flights ==

On 3 August 1935 Levanevsky and a two-man crew (co-pilot Georgy Baydukov and navigator Viktor Levchenko) attempted a transpolar flight from Moscow to San Francisco in a prototype single engine Tupolev ANT-25 long-range bomber. A thousand miles into the flight (just north of the Kola Peninsula) the oil tank developed an oil-leak, being overfilled, and Levanevsky chose to abort the mission. 

In the summer of 1936, Levanevsky and Viktor Levchenko evaluated the air route from Santa Monica, California to Moscow, via Alaska and Siberia. The 10,000 mile flight was made in a Vultee V-1AS, though the floats were replaced with wheel landing gear. For this flight Levanevsky was awarded with Order of Red Banner of Labour.

On 12 August 1937 a type Bolkhovitinov DB-A (no. N-209, a &quot;Dalniy Bombardirovshik-Academy&quot;, i.e. Long-range Bomber) aircraft with 6-men crew under captaincy of Levanevsky started its long distance flight from Moscow to the United States (to Fairbanks) via the North Pole. The radio communications with the crew broke off the next day, on the 13th of August, at 17:58 Moscow time after the North Pole, when the aircraft encountered adverse weather conditions and suffered failure of its end right engine. The Soviet Government financed two aerial searches for the missing aircraft using purchased US aircraft under the command of Canadian bush and Antarctic pilot Herbert Hollick-Kenyon in 1937 and 1938. Jimmie Mattern flew a Lockheed 12, &quot;The Texan&quot; from California to assist in the search for his former rescuer in the initial search. After the unsuccessful search attempts all the members of the crew were presumed dead.

In March 1999, Dennis Thurston of the Minerals Management Service in Anchorage located what appeared to be wreckage in the shallows of Camden Bay, between Prudhoe Bay and Kaktovik. There was conjecture in the media that it was Levanevsky&#x27;s aircraft, but a subsequent attempt to locate the object again proved unsuccessful.

<text>Mikhail Vasilyevich Vodopyanov (; – 11 August 1980) was a Soviet aircraft pilot, one of the first Heroes of the Soviet Union, and a Major General of the Soviet Air Force. Together with Mikhail Babushkin, he was the first to land an airplane on the North Pole.

==Biography==
He was born on 18 November (6 November Old Style) 1899 in Bolshiye Studyonki village (now part of Lipetsk) in Tambov Governorate. He volunteered for the Red Army in 1919 and took part in the Russian Civil War. Initially, he was a driver in an air unit. From 1925 he trained as an aircraft mechanic, and in 1928 he became a pilot himself. He then worked in state commercial aviation on long distances, first flying to Sakhalin. From 1931 he also worked for the &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper, distributing its matrix from Moscow to other cities by the air.

In 1934, he participated in the Arctic rescue operation of the crew of the sunken steamship &quot;Cheliuskin&quot; on the frozen Chukchi Sea, making a historical flight from Khabarovsk to Vankarem, being the first to fly across the Chukotka Mountains. Vodopyanov was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for this deed on April 20, 1934, as one of the 7 first recipients of the title. Then, he commanded an expedition of four Tupolev TB-3 aircraft, being the first to land on the North Pole on May 21, 1937, carrying parts and crew for an Arctic station.

During World War II, after July 1941, he was the commander of the 81st Special Purpose Air Division (a long range bomber division). He commanded the first Soviet air raid on Berlin on 10/11 August 1941. On the return trip, his Petlyakov Pe-8 heavy bomber was shot down by the flak and crash landed in Estonia, in &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; between front lines. He and his crew managed to break through to the Soviet side. Vodopianov was dismissed from the commanding post as a result of big losses in this raid, but he continued to serve as a bomber pilot. (The main reasons for big losses were aircraft failures and hurried preparations, caused by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s order). In 1943 he was promoted to Major General.

After the war, in 1946 he was discharged from armed forces, and turned to writing in Moscow. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and Order of the Red Banner four times each and the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class.

Many children grew up with his book &quot;The polar pilot&quot; that has described not only his path to aviation, but also the further adventures of his plane in revolutionary Spain, as well as the description of the Cheliuskin rescue and his participation in the War.

==Honours and awards==
* Hero of the Soviet Union (20 April 1934)
* Four Order of Lenin (20 April 1934, 27 June 1937, 6 November 1945, and 6 December 1949)
* Four Order of the Red Banner (11 April 1940, 20 February 1942, 3 November 1944, 14 January 1952)
* Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class (13 July 1945)
