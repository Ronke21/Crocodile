<text>&quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; is the twenty-eighth and penultimate episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It was written by Harlan Ellison; contributors to and/or editors of the script included Steven W. Carabatsos, D. C. Fontana and Gene L. Coon. Gene Roddenberry made the final re-write. The episode was directed by Joseph Pevney and first aired on NBC on April 6, 1967.

In the episode, Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) accidentally overdoses himself with a dangerous drug. He transports himself down to a mysterious planet while not in his right mind and is pursued by a rescue party led by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who soon come across the Guardian of Forever, a sentient time portal. McCoy travels back in time while impaired and changes history to such an extent that the Federation of Planets no longer exists. Kirk and Spock follow him to Depression-era New York City to attempt to fix the damage. While in the past, Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a soup kitchen operator who dreams of a future much like his own 23rd Century. Spock eventually discovers that McCoy had changed the course of history by saving Keeler from dying in a traffic collision. Much to his personal grief, Kirk allows the crash to take place, restoring history.

The episode received widespread critical acclaim and has been frequently stated to be the best episode of the entire &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Elements such as the tragic ending were highlighted by several reviewers. It won several awards, including the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama on Television (Ellison, 1967) and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Ellison and Pevney, 1968).

==Plot==
While the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; orbits a mysterious planet causing time distortions, Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy is treating a near-death Lt. Sulu when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is rocked by another time wave and McCoy accidentally injects himself with a huge dose of cordrazine, a dangerous drug. Driven into a mad frenzy, McCoy flees from the bridge and beams himself down to the planet. Captain James T. Kirk follows with a search party that includes first officer Mr. Spock, chief engineer Mr. Scott, and communications officer Lt. Uhura. On the planet&#x27;s surface, they come across an ancient glowing ring which turns out to be a sentient object called the &quot;Guardian of Forever&quot;, a portal capable of sending them to any time and place. The Guardian offers to send them back to Earth&#x27;s past and plays a series of images of historical times which Spock records on his tricorder for research purposes. While the others are distracted, the still-frenzied Dr. McCoy bursts out from his hiding place and jumps through the portal. The landing party instantly loses contact with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and the Guardian explains that McCoy has altered the past to such an extent that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the reality they knew no longer exists.

The Guardian says that it&#x27;s possible to fix the damage, so Kirk requests that it replay the historical period it was showing when McCoy passed through. He and Spock attempt to jump through at a point in time just before McCoy&#x27;s arrival and find themselves in New York City in 1930 during the Great Depression. They steal clothes from a fire escape to blend in, and while fleeing from a policeman, hide in the basement of the 21st Street Mission. There they meet the soup kitchen&#x27;s operator, Edith Keeler. She senses something odd about the intruders but nevertheless offers to pay them to clean up the basement and finds them a place to stay. Later, Spock attempts to discover how McCoy changed history by accessing the recordings on his tricorder. This is a difficult task using the available technology of 1930, which Spock likens to &quot;stone knives and bear skins&quot;. While Spock works on the engineering problem, Kirk pays their expenses by doing odd jobs at the mission, where he falls in love with Keeler.

Unknown to Kirk and Spock, McCoy finally arrives in a highly agitated state and stumbles into the mission, where Keeler nurses him back to health. Spock completes his work and discovers that Keeler was supposed to die in a traffic collision but was somehow saved by the arrival of McCoy, creating an altered timeline in which she founded a pacifist movement on the eve of World War II. It grew powerful enough to cause the United States to delay its entrance into the war, allowing Nazi Germany time to develop the first atomic bomb and use it to win the war instead of the Allies and conquer the world. Kirk is shaken by this revelation and admits he is in love with her. Spock coldly responds that Keeler must die, in order to prevent millions of deaths and restore their future.

While walking to a Clark Gable movie with Kirk the following evening, Keeler casually mentions McCoy&#x27;s name. Shocked, Kirk tells Keeler to stay right there while he crosses the street back to the mission to inform Spock. McCoy emerges from the mission at the same time, and the trio reunite on the sidewalk. Observing this, Keeler begins to cross the street to join them and does not notice an oncoming truck. Kirk instinctively turns to save her, but a shout from Spock freezes him in his tracks, and Kirk reluctantly grabs McCoy so he can&#x27;t save her either. Keeler is struck and killed. A stunned McCoy asks Kirk if he knows what he just did, but it is Spock who replies, &quot;He knows, Doctor. He knows.&quot;

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy return through the Guardian and rejoin the landing party, where they find the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and their timeline is fully restored. As they transport back to the ship, a grim-looking Kirk ignores questions about what happened, replying simply, &quot;Let&#x27;s get the hell out of here.&quot;

==Production==

===Writing===
The writing of this episode took over ten months, from the initial pitch by Harlan Ellison to the final re-write by Gene Roddenberry. Steven W. Carabatsos and D. C. Fontana, both story editors on the show, undertook re-writes of the teleplay, and changes have also been attributed to producer Gene L. Coon. The experience led to animosity between Ellison and Roddenberry for the rest of the latter&#x27;s life, in particular over a dubious claim by Roddenberry that Ellison had the character Scotty dealing drugs in one version of the script. The episode went over budget by more than $50,000 and overran the production schedule. Mistakes were made in the set design with an instruction for &quot;runes&quot; misconstrued as a request for &quot;ruins&quot;. With Matt Jefferies ill, Rolland Brooks designed the set and the Guardian of Forever, to the surprise of Jefferies on his return.

====Initial pitch and outlines====
Harlan Ellison was one of the first writers recruited by Gene Roddenberry for &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Roddenberry was aiming to have the best science-fiction writers produce scripts for the show and had identified Ellison immediately. At the time, Ellison had been nominated for the 1965 Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Script for a Television Anthology with his script for the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Demon with a Glass Hand&quot;; he went on to win. Rather than being assigned a pre-written premise, Ellison was allowed to develop his own and propose it in a 10-page outline. Ellison had read a biography of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, and thought that it would be an interesting idea to have Kirk travel back in time and fall in love with a similar woman of good intent, but someone who must die in order to preserve the future. Ellison considered that it would have a heartrending effect on Kirk.
In March 1966, Ellison pitched the idea to Roddenberry, who accepted it. A week later, he turned in his first script treatment. Producer Robert H. Justman later recalled that he thought it was brilliant. When writing it, Ellison did not have as many restrictions as some of the later writers; he was hired prior to the series bible being created. The first version introduced Lieutenant Richard Beckwith, who is sentenced to death after he kills a fellow crewman when he is threatened with the exposure of his involvement in the illegal drug trade. Ellison had included this element, since he expected the starship to be like any other military unit, having at least some unlawful people. Beckwith is then escorted to the surface of a nearby planet alongside Kirk, with Spock to carry out the execution by firing squad. Because of the planet&#x27;s atmosphere, they have to wear environmental suits. On arriving, they find an ancient civilization and the remains of a city — this was Ellison&#x27;s &quot;city on the edge of forever&quot;. It is inhabited by several men, the Guardians of Forever, who protect an ancient time machine.

Kirk then asks to see the history of the United States on the machine, and as it reaches the Great Depression of the 1930s, Beckwith dives into the projection and vanishes. The guardians inform Kirk that history has been altered, and upon returning to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, they discover that the vessel is now crewed by renegades. They fight their way back to the transporter room and return to the planet, where the Guardians allow Kirk and Spock to pursue Beckwith into the past. They are informed by the Guardians that Beckwith prevented the death of Edith Koestler, and as in the final version, Kirk falls in love with her; in this version, however, he does so knowing that she must die in the end. Emotionally, he cannot stop Beckwith from attempting to save Koestler – Spock has to do it. Roddenberry had asked for the ship specifically to be placed in danger, and so Ellison added the renegade element in response. Beckwith is captured but again escapes into the projection and ends up in an endless loop of an exploding Nova sun – he screams, and dies forever without end.

Roddenberry disagreed with some of Kirk&#x27;s actions in the first draft, and he asked Ellison to rewrite the treatment without pay. The redraft took a further five weeks, after which Roddenberry gave more notes and Ellison took another two weeks to respond. When a version was received on May 13, Roddenberry and the executives at Desilu and NBC were all relieved—there had been concerns over the amount of time taken, as scripts were being pitched, written, and approved in the time taken for Ellison to revise his outline. This version dropped the environmental suits due to cost, and rewrote the information given to Kirk by the Guardians, making it more general and less Earth-specific. It also changed Edith Koestler&#x27;s surname to Keeler. However, the majority of the plot points were unchanged.

====Development of the teleplay====

Justman registered immediate concerns over the potential cost of attempting to film the treatment. He had particular concerns about a time portal effect, a scene involving a mammoth and the number of exterior and night shoots that would be required. Despite this, Roddenberry asked Ellison to turn it into a shooting script and set aside a desk for him in the assistant director&#x27;s room, expecting him to attend the office every day until he finished it. Ellison ended up with a smaller office of his own at his request but disliked it sufficiently that he spent the majority of his time on set. He would play loud rock and roll music in the office, and then leave it for the set. On one occasion story editor John D. F. Black caught him on set during the filming of &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; and had him escorted back to the office. The music went on, and Black went back to tell Ellison to turn it down, but the writer had already climbed out the window and left. On other occasions, he worked late into the night and slept on the couch in Justman&#x27;s office. As the delays added up, the slots assigned to &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; were reallocated to other episodes. Although this period was later claimed to be of various lengths, Ellison completed the first draft teleplay in three weeks, handing it to Justman on June 7. Black later said that Ellison always had &quot;40 things going&quot; in reference to him doing multiple assignments at once. In response, Ellison said that doing multiple assignments at the same time was simply how screenwriters earned a living in the 1960s.

Justman&#x27;s initial glee at receiving the script was short-lived. He realized quickly that it was unfilmable due to cost, and the characters were not behaving as per the writer&#x27;s guide. One such exchange between Kirk and Spock had the Vulcan character accusing humans of being barbaric, while Kirk saying Spock was ungrateful because humans were more advanced than Vulcans. Justman thought it was a good script, but could never be re-written and filmed in time for the first season. Ellison was asked to revise it once more, with the problems blamed on requests from NBC, and submitted a further version a week later. The production team was starting to lose patience, as he was not revising it in accordance to their requests, and he began arguing with Justman over the budget difficulties. On August 15 Ellison turned in a second revised draft to Justman, titled &quot;final draft&quot; on the front cover. Justman wrote a memo immediately to fellow producer Gene L. Coon, saying that after five months, Ellison had failed to reduce the budget requirements for the episode to something that could be filmed.

Roddenberry and Justman both spoke to Ellison, seeking further changes, but failed to convince him. William Shatner was sent to Ellison&#x27;s house to try to get the writer to reconcile. He claimed he was shouted at and thrown off the property, but Ellison said that Shatner had read the script through while sitting on a couch and had left to tell Roddenberry that he liked it. Ellison suggested that Shatner had a personal interest in having the script revised because Leonard Nimoy had more lines than he did in Ellison&#x27;s version, and had spent the time on the couch counting lines. Meanwhile, Steve Carabatsos replaced Black as story editor on the show and was told by Coon to fix the script. Carabatsos replaced the new characters with an accident involving McCoy and an overdose of adrenalin and removed the Guardians of Forever, replacing them with a time travel portal. Ellison subsequently accused him of &quot;taking a chainsaw&quot; to the script. Roddenberry disliked the new version sufficiently that he convinced Ellison to come back and rewrite it again.

On December 19 Ellison submitted a further revised teleplay, dated December 1. Justman suggested in a memo that Roddenberry might be able to rewrite the latest version to one that could be usable. He said that although it was a &quot;fine story&quot; and Ellison was an &quot;extremely talented writer&quot;, he felt that it needed to be either rewritten by someone else or scrapped altogether. Taking this advice in hand, Roddenberry rewrote the script over the Christmas–New Year period, handing in a new version on January 9, 1967. His changes included the elimination of the evil version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the addition of some comedy elements. Justman was pleased with Roddenberry&#x27;s changes and told Coon that it was close to being filmable but that he still expected it to exceed the budget for a single episode.

Dorothy Fontana was hired as a new story editor, replacing Carabatsos. She had previously been Roddenberry&#x27;s secretary and was well aware of the script&#x27;s problems from reading the previous versions. When she arrived at work for her first day in her new role, Roddenberry gave her a copy of his revision and told her to try rewriting it. She later referred to that day as &quot;walking into a hornets&#x27; nest&quot;, and the script itself as a &quot;live grenade&quot;. Among the changes in her version was the introduction of the drug cordrazine. Ellison specifically criticized this change, as his most recent version of the script called for an alien creature&#x27;s venom to cause the symptoms in McCoy. He said that &quot;Gene [Roddenberry] preferred having an accomplished surgeon act in such a boneheaded manner that he injects himself with a deadly drug!&quot;

Justman praised Fontana&#x27;s version, saying that it was the version that was most likely to be shot. But he suggested that it had now lost the &quot;beauty and mystery inherent in the screenplay as Harlan originally wrote it&quot;. He said that he felt bad, because if he had not seen Ellison&#x27;s earlier versions then he would probably have been &quot;thrilled&quot; with Fontana&#x27;s version. Still unsatisfied with the script, Roddenberry set about rewriting it once more, titling the result, dated February 1, the final draft. Ellison later called elements of the dialogue in this version &quot;precisely the kind of dopey Utopian bullshit that Roddenberry loved&quot;, and added that Roddenberry had &quot;about as much writing ability as the lowest industry hack&quot;. Shatner later came to believe that it was actually re-written by Gene L. Coon and only supervised by Roddenberry. Ellison requested via his agent that he be credited on the script only as Cordwainer Bird. In response, Roddenberry threatened to have Ellison blacklisted by the Writers Guild of America, and the writer was eventually convinced to be credited by name. None of the other writers involved in the work chose to seek credit for the script, since they agreed with Roddenberry that it was important for &quot;Star Trek&quot; to be associated with writers such as Ellison.

===Direction and casting===

Joseph Pevney was assigned as the director of this episode. He had previous experience in directing full-length films, and later explained that &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was the closest episode in &quot;Star Trek&quot; to that same level of work and challenge, stating that he treated it as a film. But he was critical of Ellison&#x27;s version of the script, saying that he &quot;had no sense of theater&quot; and it was fortunate that Roddenberry re-wrote it. He praised Ellison&#x27;s level of detail in the 1930s setting, and for the general idea behind the episode.

The crew were surprised when actress Joan Collins expressed an interest in appearing in the series. After her agent asked her if she wanted to appear on the show, Collins, who had never heard of it, mentioned it to her children. When her oldest daughter was enthusiastic about the show, Collins decided to accept the offer from the studio. Casting director Joe D&#x27;Agosta called her a &quot;notorious actress&quot;, but said that at the time they saw approaches from a wide range of actors and actresses who wanted to appear on the series. Pevney said &quot;Joan Collins was very good in it. She enjoyed working on the show and Bill and Leonard were both very good to her... Using her was a good choice.&quot; Collins later incorrectly recalled Keeler as a Nazi sympathiser, an error that has been repeated in biographies of the actress. Ellison said in response that this was not an intended character trait.

John Harmon appeared as a hobo in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; and returned in a more prominent role in &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;. Although some sources have credited the voice of the Guardian to James Doohan, it was actually performed by Bartell LaRue. The actor later appeared onscreen in the episode &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, and provided further voiceover work in &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot;, &quot;Patterns of Force&quot; and &quot;The Savage Curtain&quot;. Also returning to &quot;Star Trek&quot; in this episode were David L. Ross as Lt. Galloway and John Winston as Lt. Kyle.

===Filming and post production===
Filming began on February 3, 1967, with an expectation that it would take six days to film. The shoot was completed a day and a half behind schedule on February 14. The overall cost was $245,316, compared to the budget of $191,000 for this episode. The normal budget for episodes during the first season were $185,000. Roddenberry later claimed that around $257,000 was spent on the episode, and said that he could have saved a further $20,000 if he had not insisted on high-quality casting and sets. He also claimed that the original Ellison version would have cost a further $200,000 on top of what was already spent.

The shoot began on location at the Desilu Forty Acres, with Pevney aiming to complete all the location filming in a single day in order to complete the episode in the allocated six days. The site had been used previously for the episodes &quot;Miri&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot;. None of the producers expected him to do so, but with the series already $74,507 in the red and with two more episodes left to film, Desilu had to appear to NBC to be trying to keep to budget. Extensive work was completed during the daylight hours, on the set that had been used for other series such as &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, with Floyd&#x27;s barbershop appearing in some of the shots. The filming continued into the night, and with Pevney running out of time, he was not sure when to stop. The problem was that other series such as &quot;Rango&quot; and &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; had the sets booked up for the next several days, and they were unsure whether they would have time to return and film the missing scenes.

After a weekend break, filming resumed on the Desilu Gower Street sets, where &quot;My Three Sons&quot; was normally shot. These were used to represent the interior of the mission where Keeler nurses McCoy back to health. DeForest Kelley felt that McCoy should also fall for Keeler; so Pevney shot the scenes with that element included but never included it in the final cut. The following two days were spent on the same sets, while on day 5 the action moved to the bridge set for the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. This day&#x27;s shoot was meant to include scenes in the transporter room and in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; corridors, but by now the production was a full day behind and these were pushed to the following day. Partway through day 6, the filming moved to a neighboring set for the exterior ruin shots and the Guardian of Forever, which was used for the next two and a half days. The montage of historical footage was all taken from the Paramount film library, as was the footage of the Brooklyn Bridge.

Harlan Ellison long maintained that the ancient ruins were the result of someone&#x27;s misreading his description in the script of the city as &quot;covered with runes&quot;. When informed that the word &quot;runes&quot; did not appear in any version of his treatments or script (or any rewrites), Ellison responded in &quot;Edge Words&quot;, the letter column of IDW&#x27;s comic book adaptation of his original script, by admitting that his memory was faulty and that he actually told Matt Jefferies that the set should appear &quot;Ancient, incredibly ancient, with runes everywhere...&quot; He surmises that he perhaps slurred the word &quot;runes&quot; and Jefferies misheard him.

===Music===
There are a number of musical pieces reused from earlier episodes in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, including sufficient use of the scores from &quot;The Cage&quot;, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; and &quot;The Naked Time&quot; that Alexander Courage received an &quot;additional music by&quot; credit. Further pieces came from &quot;Shore Leave&quot;, &quot;Charlie X&quot; and &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;. A partial score was created by Fred Steiner, his final work of the first season. His work on &quot;Star Trek&quot; tended to focus on the use of violins and cellos to highlight romantic moments, and he did not use violas in any of his works on the series. This episode originally featured the 1931 song &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;, which was originally composed by Ray Noble with lyrics by Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly. For the version used in the episode, the lyrics were recorded by an unknown session musician.

It had been licensed to appear in the episode, and at first, Steiner sought to use motifs from &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; as the basis of his score. He wanted this to be subtle and introduce the melody of the song over time, but Justman realized what Steiner was attempting and rejected it on the basis that he did not want the song introduced too early in the episode. Another work of Steiner&#x27;s that was rejected for &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was an alternative main title track using saxophone and celesta, which he had hoped would set the episode in the tone of the 1930s. The music recorded specifically for &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was recorded in stereo, which was unusual for the series. This was rediscovered when a 15-disc soundtrack of &quot;The Original Series&quot; was being compiled by La-La Land Records, which they hypothesized was because the accompanying vocals appeared on a separate track.

By the time &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was released in the 1980s for home media use, such as on VHS and Laserdisc, the license for the use of &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; had lapsed and was instead picked up by a different studio. A new score was composed to replace the song where it was used in the episode; however, the new pieces did not match the existing Steiner works as they used a different orchestral arrangement. Steiner was not contacted or informed of the changes to the soundtrack requirements, and this was instead composed by J. Peter Robinson. The original intention was not to restore &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; to the DVD release, and issue the DVD with a disclaimer on the box, &quot;Some music has been changed for this DVD.&quot; However, the original &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; portion was erroneously included and Paramount reportedly had to pay royalties. Since the royalties had been paid, all subsequent releases have included the original &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; music and with the 1980s scores omitted.

==Reception==
===Broadcast===
&quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was first broadcast in the United States on April 6, 1967, on NBC. A 12-city overnight Trendex report compiled by Nielsen ratings showed that during the first half-hour, it held second place in the ratings behind &quot;Bewitched&quot; on ABC with 11.64 million viewers compared to &quot;Bewitched&quot;″s 15.04 million. The episode beat &quot;My Three Sons&quot; on CBS. During the second half-hour it remained in second place with 28.4 percent of the audience share, behind the 32.1 percent for &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot;, also on ABC.

A high-definition remastering of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time on October 7, 2006, in broadcast syndication in the United States. It was the fifth remastered episode to be shown. This meant that the episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and depending on the station it was broadcast either on October 7 or 8.

===Cast and crew response===
This episode has been held in high regard by those who have worked on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Roddenberry ranked it as one of his 10 favorite episodes, and said it was his favorite alongside &quot;The Menagerie&quot; and the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. In the final interview before he died, he said it was his favorite outright. Fontana said it was one of her two favorite episodes that she was not credited for, along with &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;.

Members of the main cast have also said it was among their favorites. Shatner has often chosen either this or &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; as the best episode, saying, &quot;&#x27;City&#x27; is my favorite of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series because of the fact it is a beautiful love story, well told.&quot; Nimoy described it as one of his favorites, along with &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Amok Time&quot;, &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; and &quot;The Naked Time&quot;. In his 1995 book, &quot;I Am Spock&quot;, Nimoy said that episodes such as &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; and &quot;Amok Time&quot; were &quot;just as powerful and meaningful to today&#x27;s audiences as they were to viewers back in the 1960s&quot;. Kelley said it was his favorite, adding, &quot;I thought it was one of the most dramatic endings ever seen on a television show.&quot; Karl Urban, who plays McCoy in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the sequels, said that &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was one of his favorite episodes along with &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot;, &quot;Amok Time&quot; and &quot;Arena&quot;.

===Critical acclaim===
&quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; has been frequently cited as the best episode of all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and movies. In a preview of the episode in the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;, it was said to be a &quot;surprise variation of the &#x27;time tunnel&#x27; theme&quot; and was described as &quot;an absorbing tale, a bit hard to take at times, but imaginative nonetheless&quot;. After &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, in which time travel was an integral part of the plot, was released in 1986, Luis Aguilar of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was superior to the film, calling it a &quot;brilliant, beautifully executed story&quot;.

For the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary, it was ranked as the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode. &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; has placed highly in many &quot;best of&quot; lists of &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes. In a special edition of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; during the fall of 1994, &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was ranked number one in a comprehensive listing of all 79 episodes. The article described the episode as &quot;Cosmic themes, effective acting, and a heart-wrenching ending makes this the undisputed Uber-&quot;Trek&quot;&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked it as the second best episode of the original Star Trek series to re-watch. A ranking of every episode of the original series by &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; also placed it number 1 calling it &quot;Star Trek’s greatest episode&quot;

====2000s onwards====
In their 2003 book, &quot;Beyond the Final Frontier: An Unauthorised Review of Star Trek&quot;, Mark Jones and Lance Parkin described &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; as &quot;Rightly regarded as the highlight of original &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot; and the &quot;epitome of what &quot;Star Trek&quot; does best&quot;. They said that having Kirk allow Keeler to die was &quot;horrifying and heart-rending, adding another dimension to his character&quot;.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an &#x27;A&#x27; rating in 2009, describing it as &quot;a justly revered classic&quot;. But he said that McCoy&#x27;s accidental overdose was a &quot;stretch&quot; and gave the episode &quot;a surprisingly awkward start, with little indication of the greatness that is to follow&quot;. He called the ending &quot;brutal&quot; and praised the conundrum that Kirk is placed in, faced with the death of Keeler. Handlen suggested that it would have made a better final episode of the season, instead of &quot;Operation: Annihilate&quot;. Also in 2009, it was reviewed by Torie Atkinson and Eugene Myers for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, where they gave it a rating of six out of six. They were concerned that the episode might not live up to the memory when they re-watched it, but said &quot;it remains an incredible episode, often imitated but rarely surpassed in science fiction in any medium.&quot; They said that both the tragic and comedic moments helped to balance the episode, and said that the ending was abrupt but fitting because of the change in Kirk despite the Guardian&#x27;s announcement of &quot;all is as it was before&quot;.

Keith DeCandido gave the episode a rating of ten out of ten when he reviewed it for &quot;Tor.com&quot; in 2015. He said that the episode centered on people, which he saw as a common theme among the great episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. DeCandido supported the view of Spock, that while Keeler&#x27;s compassionate nature was to be applauded, it was at the wrong time and as war with Nazi Germany was the only way. Darren Franich compared &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; to the &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; television series in 2015, calling the episode &quot;one of the great episodes of television&quot;. However, he criticised it as well, saying &quot;complete crock of pseudo-scientific claptrap. It&#x27;s wacky like only old science-fiction is wacky – and it&#x27;s slow like only old television is slow.&quot; He listed nine &quot;leaps of narrative logic&quot; that a viewer must overcome to accept the plot. But he felt that it was fearless in comparison to modern science fiction, in that there was no attempt to make it self-aware, nor introduce a comedic character to ground it. Franich said that the ending was &quot;one of the all-time great moments in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history&quot;.

IGN ranked it as number one out of their &quot;Top 10 Classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; Episodes&quot; in 2009. It said &quot;This beautiful story poignantly establishes the maxim later explored in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. Kirk&#x27;s reaction before beaming up at the end of the episode is one of William Shatner&#x27;s most moving moments in all of Trek.&quot; In the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, David Brown listed it as the second best episode for non-&quot;Star Trek&quot; fans to watch on Netflix in 2016, calling it a &quot;tragic &quot;Back to the Future&quot;&quot; and that &quot;seeing as the bulk of the drama takes place during the depression of the 1930s, there&#x27;s not much in the way of sci-fi gubbins to confuse a newcomer&quot;. Jeremy Fuster at Yahoo! TV included it on a list of ten episodes to watch prior to the launch of the 2017 television series, calling it &quot;one of the most heartbreaking episodes&quot; of the series.

In 2009, while writing for &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, John Cloud rated &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever &quot; as one of the top ten moments of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall including films up to that time. Cloud noted &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; as &quot;a tightly wound episode that sets the standard for time-travel sci-fi&quot;. Specific elements of the episode led to other rankings, such as Comic Book Resources (CBR) placing it as the tenth-best romantic relationship of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise up to that time, between Kirk and Edith Keeler. In a listing of the best time-travel episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; series by CBR, it was placed first; it was placed in the same position on a similar list by &quot;Nerdist&quot;.

The episode remained popular throughout the 2010s, with British Magazine &quot;SciFiNow&quot; ranking it as the best episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot; in 2010. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it one of the top ten &quot;must see&quot; episodes in 2012, as did &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2016. It was named as one of the 25 essential episodes of the franchise by Vox in 2016. In 2017, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; the second best episode of the original series; as did &quot;PopMatters&quot; a year later.

===Awards===
Harlan Ellison&#x27;s original version of the teleplay won the annual Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama on Television. Justman later said that the submission of the original unfilmed version was out of spite, and Roddenberry said in response to the victory &quot;many people would get prizes if they wrote scripts that budgeted out to three times the show&#x27;s cost.&quot; The WGA rules allow only the credited writers to submit scripts for consideration, who may submit whichever draft of theirs that they may choose. It was up against another &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode, nominated by the production team; &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot;. Coon reportedly said at the time: &quot;If Harlan wins, I&#x27;m going to die&quot;, and that &quot;there are two scripts up tonight for the Writers&#x27; Guild Award, and I wrote them both.&quot; On that night, Roddenberry and several of the crew were seated at a table that Desilu had purchased, while Ellison was at another. When he won, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; party rose to their feet and applauded, since they believed it would bring credibility to the series. Herbert Franklin Solow later recalled that this elation turned to horror when Ellison began talking about the interference of studio executives in the writing process, before holding aloft a copy of the original script and yelling &quot;Remember, never let them rewrite you!&quot; Ellison walked past the Desilu table as he left the podium, and shook the copy of the script at Roddenberry and his party.

When Glen A. Larson claimed that it was Coon who had rewritten the original script and it was this version that was submitted to the Writer&#x27;s Guild, Ellison said that &quot;pandas will fly out of Glen Larson&#x27;s ass!&quot;. He explained that as the credited writer, he had the option of which version of the script to submit to the Guild. A further claim was made by writer Don Ingalls, who said that Ellison had admitted in a drunken stupor to him late one night in a bar that he had tidied up and improved the script further prior to submitting it; this was then published in Justman and Solow&#x27;s &quot;Inside Star Trek: The Real Story&quot;. Ellison repudiated Ingalls&#x27; claim, pointing out that he never drank since he did not like the taste and had never been drunk and so this could not have occurred. Upon being informed, Solow promised to add a note refuting the claim in a future paperback edition, but then decided to agree with Ingalls&#x27; version of the story.

&quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was awarded the Hugo Award in 1968 for the &quot;Best Dramatic Presentation&quot; at that year&#x27;s World Science Fiction Convention. This was based on the filmed version, and not Ellison&#x27;s original. But since the script remained credited to Ellison, he won the award once more. It was 25 years before another &quot;Star Trek&quot; television program won that award again, the next occasion being for the episode &quot;The Inner Light&quot; from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Roddenberry later claimed that he was present at the Hugo Awards, and said that Ellison rushed past him up onto the stage. However, he was not present. Ellison remarked afterwards when talking about the Hugo win for the filmed version of the script, &quot;I would like to be arrogant enough to think that the script was so good that even butchering it couldn&#x27;t hurt it&quot; and that compared to the other episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; that it was &quot;a pretty good show&quot;. Roddenberry claimed, in response to Ellison&#x27;s awards wins for the episode, that he had won a Nebula Award for his work on it. However, this was untrue, and the Dramatic Presentation category was not created until 1974.

==Home media release and other adaptations==
The first adaptation of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was as a re-working into a short story by author James Blish in the novel &quot;Star Trek 2&quot;. He attempted to combine elements of both the televised version with aspects of Ellison&#x27;s original version after being sent a copy of the original script by Ellison. The front cover of the British release of the book featured the Guardian of Forever. This was republished in 2016 alongside the Blish short stories of 44 other episodes in a single volume as &quot;Star Trek: The Classic Episodes&quot;. The first home media release of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was on Compact Cassette from Startone productions in 1982. A LaserDisc of the episode, alongside &quot;The Alternative Factor&quot; was released in 1985. Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on VHS and Betamax.

&quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was released on DVD paired with &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot; as part of the general release of the series in 2000, and as part of the season one DVD set in 2004. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009. The remastered version included revamped and expanded special effects by CBS Digital under the guidance of Dave Rossi, as well as Mike and Denise Okuda. Changes included an expanded field of ruins on the Guardian&#x27;s planet, as well as updated visuals of the planet from space. Rossi explained that they sought to tie the purple cloth backdrop used in the original version into the redesign, but was concerned that the &quot;giant purplish desert flats&quot; as seen from space were instead misconstrued as oceans. &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was also featured in several DVD sets featuring compilations of episodes, including the &quot;Star Trek: Fan Collective: Captain&#x27;s Log&quot;, as selected by Shatner, and &quot;Captain Kirk&#x27;s Boldest Missions&quot; in 2015.

==Legacy==
===Ellison–Roddenberry feud===
During the period in which the script was being developed, Roddenberry asked Ellison for his help in saving the show. In response, Ellison agreed with other science fiction writers, including Richard Matheson, Theodore Sturgeon and Frank Herbert to form &quot;The Committee&quot;. Ellison wrote on their behalf to the combined membership of the recent World Science Fiction Convention to ask them to write in to NBC to save the show. Shatner later credited Ellison for saving the show during the first season. But after the work was completed on the episode, Roddenberry and Ellison did not speak for several years. Ellison said he felt used, while Roddenberry said he was being unfair and had unjustly condemned the episode, loudly and in public. Ellison sold copies of his original script at conventions, while Roddenberry&#x27;s Lincoln Enterprises sold the filmed version. In 1975, Ellison copyrighted the version of the first draft script as it was returned to him with notes, which was then published in &quot;Six Science Fiction Plays&quot; by Simon &amp; Schuster. By this time, he and Roddenberry had taken conciliatory steps toward each other, and he was invited to pitch a story idea for a late 1970s &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, despite calling &quot;Star Trek&quot; &quot;dead&quot; in an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; when the film project was first announced.

This did not last. Roddenberry claimed in an interview with &quot;Video Review&quot; magazine that Ellison wrote into the script that he had Scotty dealing drugs and when asked to remove it, Ellison claimed that Roddenberry had &quot;sold out&quot;. At no point in any of the versions of the outlines or scripts did Scotty deal or take drugs. Roddenberry repeated this claim around the same period in 1987, including to Ben Harnson in an interview for &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; magazine, and on the convention lecture circuit. Two issues later, writer Alan Brennert wrote into the letters page of &quot;Video Review&quot; asserting that Scotty had never sold drugs in any version of the script. In response, Roddenberry wrote to Brennert, dated March 25, 1987, and admitted to mistakenly attributing the drug dealing to Scotty. Despite this, other publications have repeated the incorrect claim by Roddenberry. Roddenberry also claimed to have created the Edith Keeler character and based her on his father, a police officer, in an interview with &quot;Humanist&quot; magazine in March 1991.

Until approached by &quot;TV Guide&quot; in December 1994, Ellison did not discuss the issues with the episode in print other than the introduction in &quot;Six Science Fiction Plays&quot;. He was reluctant to discuss it for the magazine, and to make them go away, asked for a sum of money he believed was five times more than the magazine had ever paid for an interview. To his surprise, the magazine agreed. So he wrote the article, which immediately generated a backlash from &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans.

In his 1996 book, &quot;Harlan Ellison&#x27;s The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, Ellison claimed to have never received more than a &quot;pittance&quot; from working on the episode. He said &quot;every thug and studio putz and semi-literate bandwagon-jumper and merchandiser has grown fat as a maggot in a corpse off what I created.&quot; He said that was the reason why he wrote the book. On March 13, 2009, Ellison filed a lawsuit against CBS Television Studios, seeking 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also named the Writers Guild of America for repeatedly failing to act on Ellison&#x27;s behalf on the matter. In a press statement, Ellison said, &quot;It ain&#x27;t about the &#x27;principle,&#x27; friend, it&#x27;s about the money! Pay me! I&#x27;m doing it for the 35-year-long disrespect and the money!&quot; On October 22, 2009, the lawsuit was settled with Ellison claiming he was satisfied with the outcome.

===Guardian of Forever===
The Guardian of Forever, the time portal portrayed in the original series episode, is an irregular ring (or torus) shaped structure around wide. The Guardian&#x27;s next on-screen appearance was in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Yesteryear&quot; (1973), in which the Guardian&#x27;s voice was provided by James Doohan (who portrays Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott).

A return for the Guardian in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was proposed by Trent Christopher Ganino and Eric A. Stillwell during the writing of the episode &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;. This would have seen a team of Vulcan scientists led by Sarek studying the Guardian, and accidentally travelling back in time to the history of their planet where they cause the death of Surak, the founder of Vulcan logic. After they return, they discover that their people had allied with the Romulans and were at war with the Federation. In response, Sarek elects to return to the past and take on the role of Surak to restore the timeline. Producer Michael Piller wanted the plot to be centered on the cast of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, so Sarek and the Guardian were dropped from the story.

The Guardian returned in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; in the two-part story &quot;Terra Firma&quot; episodes 9–10. In those episodes, the Guardian has relocated itself to another planet, Dannus V, to prevent itself from being weaponized in the Temporal Wars. It also has the ability to project a humanoid avatar, named Carl (Paul Guilfoyle), which it uses to hide its true nature until it trusts any individuals that encounter it. The Guardian tests Philippa Georgiou before sending her back to a time that she can survive in.

====Non-canonical novels and short stories====
The Guardian of Forever has also appeared in several &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels. The first appearance was in &quot;Star Trek: The New Voyages,&quot; a 1976 compilation of short stories that was the first anthology of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fiction. The short story &quot;Mind Sifter&quot; by Shirley S. Maiewski saw Captain Kirk stranded on 1950s Earth in a mental hospital, having been abducted by Kor, subjected to a Klingon mind sifter, and transported through the Guardian of Forever. In A.C. Crispin&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Son&quot;, the Guardian is used by Kirk, Spock and McCoy to visit Sarpeidon in the past from the episode &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;. There they discover that the subject of Spock&#x27;s romantic liaison, Zarabeth, had died years before but she had given birth to his son, Zar. An audio recording by Nimoy and George Takei was subsequently released. After the success of the book, Crispin was asked to write a sequel, &quot;Time for Yesterday&quot; in 1988, in which the Guardian is malfunctioning and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew must seek the help of Zar to communicate and repair it.

Peter David decided to base his 1992 novel &quot;Imzadi&quot; on the same premise as the end of Ellison&#x27;s version of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, except in this case it was William Riker who went back in time using the Guardian deliberately to save the life of Deanna Troi. He felt that if Ellison was not allowed to use the idea in the episode, he could instead feature the premise in a novel. The Guardian was also central to the plot of Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens&#x27; 1994 novel &quot;Federation&quot; as it recites three historical events to Captain Kirk.

Brett Hudgins short story &quot;Guardians&quot; was featured in the seventh volume of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; in 2004, an annually published work of fan stories. In the story, the Horta from &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; colonise the Guardian&#x27;s &quot;Time Planet&quot; and end up acting as its protectors for the following generations over the following 50,000 years. David R. George III decided to include the Guardian and spin-off from events in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; in his 2006 trilogy, &quot;Crucible.&quot; In &quot;Provenance of Shadows&quot;, the installment of the trilogy based on McCoy, part of the book is based in the reality where McCoy is trapped in the past and no-one comes to rescue him. The events of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; are also recounted in the fictional &quot;The Autobiography of James T. Kirk&quot; by David A. Goodman; the author said that the effects of the episode and the loss of Keeler would affect Kirk for a long time and may have been why the character never entered into a serious ongoing relationship.

====Non-canonical comics and computer games====
In the Gold Key Comics &quot;Star Trek&quot; line, the Guardian of Forever appeared in the story &quot;No Time Like the Past&quot; by George Kashdan and Al McWilliams and appearing in issue 56, published October 1978. Kirk, Spock and McCoy must correct history after another traveller uses the Guardian to travel to the second century BC, and they confront both Hannibal and the Romans. In the second volume of DC Comics run of &quot;Star Trek&quot; comics, the Guardian appears in issues 53 through 57 within the story &quot;Timecrime&quot; by Howard Weinstein, Rod Whigham, Rob Davis, and Arne Starr.

IDW Publishing published Ellison&#x27;s script as a comic book under the title of &quot;Star Trek: Harlan Ellison&#x27;s Original The City On The Edge Of Forever Teleplay&quot; in 2014. Chief Creative Officer and Editor-in-Chief Chris Ryall said &quot;Presenting Harlan Ellison&#x27;s brilliant original script for &#x27;City on the Edge&#x27; has been a goal of ours since IDW first began publishing Star Trek comics in 2007&quot;. Ellison worked alongside IDW on the comic, with artwork by J.K. Woodward and additional writing by Scott Tipton and David Tipton. Ellison said of the format, &quot;To read a graphic novel is to engage your imagination is to engage all five of your senses and to picture what the creator dreamed. And that&#x27;s what this book does for me.&quot; A reprint collection was released in 2015 (ISBN 978-1631402067).

In the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, the mission &quot;City on the Edge of Never&quot; involved the player character using the Guardian to travel through time to 2270 to stop Klingons intent on altering history. The episode features the USS &quot;Kirk&quot;, and has the Guardian projecting a time portal into space, allowing the player to take their vessel through to the past. It featured voice acting by Nimoy and was well received by reviewers with &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Mike Fahey saying &quot;This mission might have just made the entire game for me. Everything about it was simply perfect. If &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; fails for some reason, this mission will always be remembered. The mission as it was is no longer available.&quot;

===&quot;Let&#x27;s get the hell out of here,&quot; Nazis, and other influences===
Kirk&#x27;s final line in the episode, &quot;Let&#x27;s get the hell out of here,&quot; caused problems for the crew as the network did not want the word &quot;hell&quot; to appear in television episodes. Both Shatner and Roddenberry fought for the line to remain, with Roddenberry claiming to NBC that no other word would be suitable to be used instead. The studio executives agreed that it could be left in, and it was one of the first occasions in which the word &quot;hell&quot; was used as profanity on television. The episode was also the first time that the Nazis were mentioned in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They featured more prominently in the second-season episode &quot;Patterns of Force&quot; as well as a pair of two-part episodes, one each from other &quot;Trek&quot; franchises: one from &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as &quot;The Killing Game&quot; and the other from &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; as &quot;Storm Front&quot;.

When a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film was being developed in the late 1970s, one of the ideas proposed by Roddenberry was to have the crew travel back to the 1960s and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This idea was based on &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, due to the episode&#x27;s popularity among fans by that time. The episode was also suggested by Robert F. Moss in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as later influencing the plot of &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. When Nimoy met Harve Bennett to discuss proposed plots for the film, it was Bennett&#x27;s love of &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; that led to him suggesting that they should include a time travel element in the film. This led to the duo discussing the potential plot with Ellison. A reference to &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; was included in the two-part &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Past Tense&quot;, with a boxing poster appearing in a scene set in the 1930s featuring Kid McCook and Mike Mason. There was a similar poster advertising a match at Madison Square Garden in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, while the one in &quot;Past Tense&quot; stated that it was a rematch in San Francisco.

===Trading Cards===
In 2020, Rittenhouse Archives Ltd. released the Star Trek The Original Series Archives and Inscriptions Trading Cards product. Included in the product was a 44-card insert set titled &quot;Uncut The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. The set featured scenes from the episode on the fronts and short descriptions of the action on the backs.

<text>Wilhelm Peter Eduard Simon Rüppell, also spelled Rueppell (20 November 1794 – 10 December 1884) was a German naturalist and explorer, best known for his collections and descriptions of plants and animals from Africa and Arabia. 

==Biography==
Rüppell was born in Frankfurt am Main, the son of a prosperous banker, who was a partner in &#x27;Rüppell und Harnier’s Bank&#x27;. He was originally destined to be a merchant, but after a visit to Sinai in 1817, where he met Henry Salt and the Swiss-German traveller Ludwig Burckhardt. He explored Giza and the Pyramids with Salt. In 1818, he developed an interest in natural history, and became elected member of the &quot;Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft&quot;. He attended lectures at the University of Pavia and University of Genoa in botany and zoology.

Rüppell set off on his first expedition in 1821, accompanied by surgeon Michael Hey as his assistant. They travelled through the Sinai desert, and in 1822, were the first European explorers to reach the Gulf of Aqaba. They then proceeded to Alexandria via Mount Sinai. In 1823, they travelled up the Nile to Nubia, collecting specimens in the area south of Ambukol, returning to Cairo in July 1825. A planned journey through Ethiopia only reached as far as Massawa, where the party suffered ill health.

Rüppell returned to Europe in 1827, after battling pirates who had occupied his ship for 2 weeks. During his absence, Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar had used specimens sent back by Rüppell to produce the &quot;Atlas zu der Reise im nordlichen Afrika&quot; (Atlas of Travels in northern Africa) (1826). In Frankfurt, he published scientific accounts with descriptions of the various animals had encountered.

In 1830, Rüppell returned to Africa, and became the first naturalist to traverse Ethiopia (or Abyssinia as it was known then). He had been sent by the Senckenberg Nature Research Society (Senckenberg Naturforschende Gesellschaft), a learned association based in Frankfurt. He was one of the first collectors of old Abyssinian manuscripts. He climbed Mount Sinai. Then in 1831, his team was based at Massawa for 6 months, while he collected plants and animals from the Red Sea, on excursions to the Dahlac Islands and also inland to Arkeko. 
He meet an Abyssinian trader &#x27;Genata Mariam&#x27; from Gondar, who had 49 camels and 40 mules and donkeys in his caravan. They travelled to Adigrat in the Tigray Region and then through the valley of the Tacazze River to the Semien Mountains. He studied the Gelada Baboon, the Walia Ibex and the Giant Lobelia (&quot;Lobelia rhynchopetalum&quot;). In Gondar, Rüppell was received an audience with the local Emperor Aito Saglu Denghe. He then collected various specimens near Lake Tana and along the uppermost part of the Blue Nile. In 1833, he left Gondar and then travelled to Kiratza and its monastery. In July 1833, the party and his collection sailed from Massawa via Jidda to Egypt, and Rüppell continued to Marseille and back to Frankfurt. Unfortunately, a Russian ship with some of his collection sank off the French coast.

Around 100 new plant species were described in the years 1837-45, due to his collection. The herbarium contains more than 200 specimens and more than 25 species of vascular plants have been named after Rüppell.

He and a number of collaborators described the vertebrates in a series of general publications and later books on birds appeared.
From all his journeys in North East Africa and Arabia, it is estimated that Rüppell himself described 32 new genera and 450 species of animals, including the Semien Wolf (&quot;Canis simensis Rüppell&quot; 1840), the Walia Ibex (&quot;Capra walie&quot; Rüppell 1835), and the Gelada Baboon (&quot;Theropithecus gelada&quot; Rüppell 1835).

<text>&quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot; (also known as &quot;Flashbacks&quot;) is the seventh episode of the second season of the American animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. The 20th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 17, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker, along with Nancy M. Pimental, and directed by Parker. It guest stars Henry Winkler, Jay Leno, and Brent Musburger. In the episode, the boys reminisce about past experiences as their school bus is left teetering on the edge of a cliff. Ms. Crabtree leaves to seek help, but forgets about the children when she meets a truck driver named Marcus, and pursues a career as a stand-up comedian.

==Plot==
The children are on the bus, following a diversion along a mountain pass. When Ms. Crabtree gets distracted by the kids, the bus veers off the road and nearly goes over a cliff. She leaves to seek help, telling the kids not to leave the bus, because &quot;a big scary monster&quot; will eat them. The kids remain there and remember past experiences (featuring clips from previous episodes), although they usually end with everyone enjoying ice cream (as noted by new animated sequences). When a student wearing a red shirt tries to leave the bus, a gigantic black monster kills him before disappearing; later on, the black monster returns and kills Kenny.

Meanwhile, Ms. Crabtree meets a truckdriver named Marcus. He takes her to a club where Carrot Top is performing and Ms. Crabtree insults him, which appeals to the audience. Marcus takes her to an agent, who finds her funny and hires her as a comedian. By now, she has forgotten about rescuing the stranded children. She soon quits, but she and Marcus remain close. Back in South Park, Mr. Mackey convinces the parents that their children have run away, so they write a song and perform it on television. The children see this on a TV in the bus and are embarrassed.

An argument in which Kyle corrects Cartman&#x27;s past experience causes the bus to go over the cliff; it lands in a gigantic tub of ice cream. Cartman suddenly realizes how little sense everything makes and wakes up in his own bed. As he explains his dream to his mother, she offers him beetles for breakfast and ice cream as well. Stan wakes up in his bed, and calls Kyle to tell him about the dream. Ms. Crabtree and Marcus are shown sitting on a log near Stark&#x27;s Pond – Marcus explains that this is all a kid&#x27;s dream, but Ms. Crabtree says she just wants to enjoy the moment a little longer.

==Cultural references==
The title of the episode references &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, the title of a 1967 episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. Several aspects of the episode itself also parody &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

The 1997 action film &quot;Con Air&quot; is referenced when Ms. Crabtree holds up a (live) bunny and threatens to shoot it if the children would not be quiet.

One of the children&#x27;s flashbacks features Fonzie from &quot;Happy Days&quot; jumping over a series of garbage cans, referencing the Season 3 two-part episode &quot;Fearless Fonzarelli&quot;.

One of the missing posters featured Macaulay Culkin, possibly as a reference to the first two &quot;Home Alone&quot; films.

The song and video of the children&#x27;s parents singing is a parody of the renowned &quot;We Are the World&quot; song.

<doc id="401230" wikidata="Q313947" url="?curid=401230" title="Henry Gantt">
<text>Henry Laurence Gantt (; May 20, 1861 – November 23, 1919) was an American mechanical engineer and management consultant who is best known for his work in the development of scientific management. He created the Gantt chart in the 1910s.

Gantt charts were employed on major infrastructure projects including the Hoover Dam and Interstate highway system and continue to be an important tool in project management and program management.

Gantt is also recognized as an early proponent of the social responsibility of businesses.

== Biography ==
===Early life, education and family===
Gantt was born to a prosperous plantation family in Calvert County, Maryland at the outbreak of the American Civil War. When the war ended the family lost their slaves and land and moved to Baltimore.

He graduated from McDonogh School in 1878 and from Johns Hopkins University in 1880, and then returned to the McDonogh School to teach for three years. He subsequently received a Master of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. Henry Gantt married Mary E. Snow of Fitchburg, Massachusetts on 29 Nov 1899.

===Career===
In 1884, Gantt began working as a draughtsman at the iron foundry and machine-shop Poole &amp; Hunt in Baltimore. 

In 1887 he joined Frederick W. Taylor, initially as an assistant. Here he began applying scientific management principles to the work at Midvale Steel and Bethlehem Steel, working there with Taylor until 1893. They jointly received six patents and he followed Taylor to Simonds Rolling Company before they went to Bethlehem Steel for a consulting project. He credited Taylor with being the first to study every element of the labor problem and has been referred to as one of the most influential of Taylor&#x27;s associates.

In 1908-09, he undertook projects at Joseph Bancroft &amp; Sons Company and Williams &amp; Wilkins. 

In 1911, Gantt along with Taylor followers Frank Gilbreth and Carl Barth founded The Society to Promote the Science of Management, later known as the Taylor Society, to promote Taylor&#x27;s methods and philosophy in industry. 

From 1902 to 1919 Gantt worked as a private consultant to industry on efficiency improvement and was active in promoting scientific management, as Taylor&#x27;s general approach came to be called. 

In his later career as an industrial consultant, following the invention of the Gantt chart, he designed the &#x27;task and bonus&#x27; system of wage payment and additional measurement methods for worker efficiency and productivity.

In 1916, influenced by Thorsten Veblen Gantt set up the &quot;New Machine&quot;, an association which sought to apply the criteria of industrial efficiency to the political process. With the Marxist Walter Polakov he led a breakaway from the 1916 ASME conference to call for socializing industrial production under the control of managers incorporating Polakov&#x27;s analysis of inefficiency in the industrial context.

Henry Gantt is listed under Stevens Institute of Technology alumni. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) published his biography in 1934 and awards an annual medal in honor of Henry Laurence Gantt.

== Work ==
Henry Gantt&#x27;s legacy to project management is the following:
* The Gantt chart: Still accepted as an important management tool today, the Gantt chart is a graphical format that is used for the planning, scheduling, and controlling of work, including recording the progress of a project and its stages. The chart has a modern variation, Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT).
* Industrial Efficiency: Industrial efficiency can only be produced by the application of scientific analysis to all aspects of the work in progress. The industrial management role is to improve the system by eliminating chance and accidents.
* The Task and Bonus System: He linked the bonus paid to managers to how well they taught their employees to improve performance.
* The social responsibility of business: He believed that businesses have obligations to the welfare of the society in which they operate.

=== Gantt charts ===
Gantt created many different types of charts. He designed his charts so that foremen or other supervisors could quickly know whether production was on schedule, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule.

Gantt (1903) describes two types of &quot;balances&quot;:
* the &quot;man’s record&quot;, which shows what each worker should do and did do, and
* the &quot;daily balance of work&quot;, which shows the amount of work to be done and the amount that is done.
Gantt gives an example with orders that will require many days to complete. The daily balance has rows for each day and columns for each part or each operation. At the top of each column is the amount needed. The amount entered in the appropriate cell is the number of parts done each day and the cumulative total for that part. Heavy horizontal lines indicate the starting date and the date that the order should be done. According to Gantt, the graphical daily balance is &quot;a method of scheduling and recording work&quot;. In this 1903 article, Gantt also describes the use of:
* &quot;production cards&quot; for assigning work to each operator and recording how much was done each day.

=== &quot;Work, Wages, and Profits&quot;, 1916 ===
In his 1916 book &quot;Work, Wages, and Profits&quot; Gantt explicitly discusses scheduling, especially in the job shop environment. He proposes giving to the foreman each day an &quot;order of work&quot; that is an ordered list of jobs to be done that day. Moreover, he discusses the need to coordinate activities to avoid &quot;interferences&quot;. However, he also warns that the most elegant schedules created by planning offices are useless if they are ignored, a situation that he observed. More generally, he addresses the value of applying scientific analysis to the study of work and labor to develop general laws that can lead to high levels of industrial efficiency.

=== &quot;Organizing for Work,&quot; 1919 ===
In his 1919 book &quot;Organizing for Work&quot; Gantt gives two principles for his charts:
* one, measure activities by the amount of &quot;time&quot; needed to complete them;
* two, the space on the chart can be used to represent the &quot;amount of the activity&quot; that should have been done in that time.
Gantt shows a progress chart that indicates for each month of the year, using a thin horizontal line, the number of items produced during that month. In addition, a thick horizontal line indicates the number of items produced during the year. Each row in the chart corresponds to an order for parts from a specific contractor, and each row indicates the starting month and ending month of the deliveries. It is the closest thing to the Gantt charts typically used today in scheduling systems, though it is at a higher level than machine scheduling.

Gantt&#x27;s machine record chart and man record chart are quite similar, though they show both the actual working time for each day and the cumulative working time for a week. Each row of the chart corresponds to an individual machine or operator. These charts do not indicate which tasks were to be done, however.

In addition to these technical enhancements, this book also dealt with the broader theme of the obligations of business to society and the particular need for means of reconciling pursuit of profits with the welfare of society. He argued that there needed to be a fair distribution of returns from industry to all segments of the community or society might seek to take control of the means of production. He favored small versus large businesses to promote competition, lower prices and provide better quality and service to customers.

=== Henry Gantt and Karol Adamiecki ===
A novel method of displaying interdependencies of processes to increase visibility of production schedules was invented in 1896 by Karol Adamiecki, which was similar to the one defined by Gantt in 1903. However, Adamiecki did not publish his works in a language popular in the West; hence Gantt was able to popularize a similar method, which he developed around the years 1910–1915, and the solution became attributed to Gantt. With minor modifications, what originated as the Adamiecki&#x27;s chart is now more commonly referred to as the Gantt Chart.

<text>Konrad Vilhelm Mägi (1 November 1878 – 15 August 1925) was one of the first modernist painters in Estonia and the Nordic countries, at the core of whose creative legacy are visionary landscapes. He only worked for sixteen years, yet the total volume of his oeuvre is estimated to be around 400 paintings.

Numerous exhibitions of his works have been held in Estonia, and in recent years, his art has been discovered in Europe: in 2017, there was a solo exhibition of Konrad Mägi’s paintings in the Galleria Nazionale d&#x27;Arte Moderna in Rome; in 2018, his works were displayed at the exhibition &quot;Wild Souls: Symbolism in the Art Of the Baltic States&quot; in the Orsay Museum; in 2021, more than a hundred of Mägi’s works were exhibited in the EMMA Museum in Espoo, and in 2022, the same works were displayed in the Lillehammer Art Museum.

Konrad Mägi’s works are particularly appreciated for their vigorous and impulsive colours and a pantheistic approach to nature, making him unique in European early-20th-century modernism. Mägi worked in different parts of Europe, according to which his oeuvre is divided into rather dissimilar chapters: Denmark, Norway, France, the island of Saaremaa, southern Estonia, Italy, etc.

The reception of his art went through various periods, too. In the 1920s and 1930s, Konrad Mägi’s oeuvre influenced a large part of Estonian art created at the time. During World War II, his art was condemned (the Soviet authorities ordered his works to be removed from exhibitions, his letters to be destroyed, etc.); it continued to be forbidden until the second half of the 1950s. Towards the end of the 1950s, as political austerity relaxed, Mägi’s oeuvre was &quot;reintroduced&quot; and several retrospectives were held.

Despite the fact that Mägi spent the majority of his life in towns, his oeuvre mainly revolves around landscapes: environments lacking humans, where nature offers irrational, mystical, metaphysical and religious experiences. Konrad Mägi’s oeuvre is rooted in existential tensions that made him yearn for other potential worlds. As a young man he took actively part in the revolutionary movement, but later withdrew completely from politics and focussed entirely on art. “Happiness is not for us, sons of a poor land,” Mägi once wrote. “For us, art is the only way out, because when the soul is filled with the eternal suffering of life, art will provide what life cannot give us. There, in art, in one’s own oeuvre, can one find peace.”

In addition to landscape paintings, Mägi painted portraits (including several portraits of members of the women’s movement) and still-lifes. He was the first director of Pallas, the first Estonian higher art school.

Konrad Mägi’s health seriously troubled him throughout his creative career: various illnesses led to a rapid deterioration of his health in the 1920s. Konrad Mägi was only 46 years old when he died. The whereabouts of more than half of his works are still unknown.

==Biography==

=== Childhood ===
Konrad Mägi was born on 1 November 1878 in southern Estonia. He spent his childhood in the small village of Uderna near Elva, which was surrounded by large virgin forests and had a big railway line passing through it. His father, Andres Mägi, was a comparatively well-to-do estate manager, who took actively part in the Estonian national awakening movement in the second half of the 19th century. Practically nothing is known about Konrad Mägi’s mother, Leena Mägi. Konrad Mägi was the youngest child in the family: he had four older brothers and an older sister; another older brother had died as a child. The first name Konrad was possibly chosen because German names were popular among the Estonian rural population at the time. In Uderna, he attended the local elementary school for barely a few months.

Something must have happened to Andres Mägi’s mental health:  he began changing jobs increasingly often. That led to the dissolution of the family: at the age of 11, Konrad Mägi moved to Tartu with his mother and sister. In the autumn of 1890, Konrad Mägi began to study at the three-year elementary school of the Tartu Apostolic Orthodox Church, which he quit after only a couple of months. A few years later, he enrolled in the Municipal School of Tartu, but never finished his studies there either. Instead, he became a carpenter’s apprentice at the local furniture factory. A few furniture designs from that period have survived.

=== Discovering Art ===
In 19th-century Estonia, fine arts were something that mainly Baltic-Germans had access to. The indigenous rural population did not see much art, not to mention creating it. Nevertheless, towards the end of the century, various cultural activities emerged, including an interest in art. Konrad Mägi and his friends became actively engaged in physical culture and sports, but were also interested in theatre, literature, philosophy and classical music.

In 1897, Konrad Mägi was employed by the Bandelier Furniture Factory, where he was entrusted with making complicated rosettes and volutes. Because of the factory owners’ wish to improve the quality of their products, Mägi and other employees were enrolled in Rudolf von zur Mühlen’s drawing classes. There, Mägi studied perspective drawing as well as technical drawing and possibly had his first encounters with painting. In 1902, Mägi decided to go and study art at the Stieglitz School of Technical Drawing in St. Petersburg.

== Travels ==

=== St. Petersburg ===
Konrad Mägi arrived in Saint Petersburg in January 1903 to study sculpture under Amandus Adamson at the Stieglitz school. His studies were successful, and he met several other Estonians aiming to become artists, including Nikolai Triik. Nevertheless, he was not happy with the technical and rather dry approach to drawing at Stieglitz. When sculpture department was shut down a while later, Mägi gradually lost his interest in studies. He is known to have actively visited museums and to have been most of all fascinated by the works of Mikhail Vrubel and Nicholas Roerich.

When the revolution of 1905 broke out, Mägi participated in the events: he is said to have organised several provocations in churches and even to have aided revolutionaries in caching their weapons.

Mägi collaborated with several political publications in Estonia by sending them satirical illustrations with a symbolic undertone. There was a student strike also in the Stieglitz school, and one of the organisers may have been Mägi. He refused to continue his studies in a backward school and was dismissed. He went on to study in the studio of Jakob Goldblatt and also began to teach art lessons, but in April 1906 he left St. Petersburg.

=== The Åland Islands and Helsinki ===

Mägi was 27 years old and had not completed a single work of art, although his urge to become an artist was increasing. After leaving St. Petersburg, he decided to spend the summer of 1906 with his friends in the Åland Islands. Fascinated by the romantic surroundings and following Nikolai Triik’s example Mägi took up painting for the first time. There are known to have been several painting sketches in his rented room, none of which have been preserved.

There is only one extant painting from the Åland period. It has very few of those characteristics that later became representative of Konrad Mägi’s style. Mägi finally managed to work consistently, being inspired by nature, and this pattern of living in a town and painting in the countryside characterised his lifestyle from then on.

In September 1906, Mägi and his friends left Åland for Helsinki, where Mägi studied for a short period at the Ateneum drawing school. He also started giving art lessons to Anni and August Vesanto, who soon became his friends and patrons. Anni Vesanto sold Mägi’s watercolours in her tobacco shop, but the income Mägi received from it was insignificant. He mainly earned his living by rewriting Estonian folk songs, and as soon as he had put aside a sufficient sum, he decided to travel to Paris at the end of August 1907.

=== Paris ===
Mägi’s first period in Paris lasted from September 1907 to the spring of 1908. “I’ve been in Paris for two days. I did not like Germany at all. Their technology was fantastic, but their stupidity was even more fantastic. France is completely different, the French themselves are truly likeable. Paris is an interesting city. There is a lot of art here to see. Overall, I like it here, although I only had a few francs in my pocket when I arrived,” Mägi wrote two days after arriving in Paris.

In Paris, Mägi initially stayed at the sculptor Jaan Koort’s place, but later moved to the artists’ colony La Ruche. He studied drawing at the independent institutions of Académie Colarossi and Académie de la Grande Chaumière.

Mägi frequented exhibitions, but was hardly fascinated by modernist art. “Of course it does not make matters better: you can often see such rubbish there that it is pointless to talk about it,” he later wrote about Parisian art exhibitions.

It is presumed that Mägi still did not paint at that time because of a shortage of money. &quot;All the money I had, which was not much, of course, I spent on tobacco and paper (tobacco is horribly expensive and bad), leaving nothing for material,&quot; he wrote to August Vesanto. It is, however, possible that he did paint, but the paintings have simply gone missing.

In the winter of 1908, Nikolai Triik arrived in Paris from Norway, and at the instigation of Triik, Mägi also decided to travel through Copenhagen to Norway for the summer and to return to Paris in the autumn.

=== Norway ===
Konrad Mägi wanted to spend only a couple of months in Norway before returning to Paris. He was 30 years old and had only created a few works, whereas his heath was gradually deteriorating. In August 1908, he moved to the countryside, where he was finally able to focus on making art: he made studies to practice his craft, because his goal was to take entrance exams to the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris in autumn. Unfortunately, he did not have enough money to leave Norway, so he stayed for another two years.

In Norway, Mägi finally started to paint. He neither dated his works precisely nor provided the exact location of the motif: his goal was to set reality aside and to sense the rhythms and structures that constitute the real essence of things and phenomena. He participated in an exhibition at the Blomqvist Gallery in Oslo, but there was no breakthrough. He did, however, also send his works to Estonia to be displayed at an exhibition organised by the Noor-Eesti (Young Estonia) literary group in 1910, and that was the beginning of his rise to prominence in his home country.

Mägi’s Norwegian landscapes include both panoramic and realistic views of nature and almost hallucinatory bog landscapes.

=== Back in Paris ===
In 1910, Konrad Mägi moved back to Paris. During his trip to Normandy in summer he began painting again, and a few works from that period have survived. In Paris, he is known to have signed at least one painting with a French spelling: K. Maegui. Three paintings by him were displayed at the 1912 exhibition of the Salon des Indépendants. Suffering from depression, he packed his things in the spring of 1912 and came back to Estonia.

=== Back in Estonia ===
In the summer of 1913, Konrad Mägi travelled to Saaremaa. As his health was deteriorating, he was hoping that the local medicinal mud and better climate would bring him some alleviation.

Mägi mainly painted on the small island of Vilsandi, working fast and not moving about much. His brushwork is denser and more intense than in Norway, and the paintings consist of small dots of colour that create an abstract rather than a realist impression. This was the first time that Estonian landscapes were depicted using the means of modern art. The precise number of Mägi’s Saaremaa landscapes is to date unknown.

During the following years, Mägi settled down in Tartu and spent his summers painting in southern Estonia (in Kasaritsa, near Lake Pühajärve, in Otepää etc.). His works started to reveal more of his personal world outlook and experiences. In the mid-1910s, Mägi’s landscapes became comparatively dark, with walls of trees and ominous skies entering the pictorial space.  This darkness can be accounted for by Mägi’s lasting depression and his progressively worsening health issues.

In the middle of the 1910s, Mägi started teaching art, and at the end of the decade, he and his peers founded the art school Pallas, whereas Mägi was elected as the first director of the school. 

=== Italy ===
For nearly ten years, Mägi did not leave Estonia, but in September 1921, he decided to go to Italy. During that journey, urban motifs appear in his oeuvre for the first time, but not as symbols of modernity, but rather as an illusion with the main focus on buildings, stairs and other architectural objects. In the summer of 1922, Mägi travelled to Rome, where he painted surprisingly few concrete urban motifs and focused instead on bodies of water and the sky, reducing the city to a narrow strip in the distance. He also painted on the island of Capri and in Venice. 

=== Final Years ===
After his return to Tartu, Mägi began teaching still-life and landscape painting. Unfortunately, by the mid-1920s, he was terminally ill. During his life and in hindsight, doctors have suspected he may have suffered from gastric ulcers, gastritis, rheumatism, radiculitis and tuberculosis. In 1924, Mägi left for Germany to be treated in a sanatorium. During the two months he spent there, he was on his feet on barely three or four days. In 1925, he returned to Estonia, where he was treated in an internal disease clinic. His irritability intensified and that has in hindsight been associated with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, which could have been caused by untreated neurosyphilis. At the end of May, his students took him to a mental hospital, where his health deteriorated irreversibly. Konrad Mägi died on 15 August 1925 at 13:20 at the age of 46.

== Portraits ==
Back in Estonia, Mägi stayed at his sister’s place in Tartu. In 1913, he began painting commissioned portraits, and during the following years he mainly painted upper-class ladies. He would also approach potential models himself, asking them if they would pose for him. He had a special interest in depicting characters from other ethnic groups: Jewish, Roma or Polish people, etc.

== Perished and Found ==
The entire scope of Konrad Mägi’s oeuvre is still unknown, because in his lifetime Mägi never kept any regular records of his work and the estimates are only approximate, but there is proof of 290 paintings by Mägi, some of which only exist in the form of a black-and-white reproduction. It has been claimed that Mägi made a total of 400 paintings, but even that figure is only an assumption. After the artist’s death, an inventory of items found in his apartment listed 88 paintings, 60 watercolours, 16 coloured drawings and 242 drawings.

In addition to works that have gone missing or have perished, Mägi’s works have also been destroyed: one of the destroyers was the artist himself, who is said to have started wrecking his own works towards the end of his life and is reported to have told employees of the Pallas art school to clean his paintings with a solvent. Several works perished in military attacks on Tartu in July 1941. Some of Mägi’s works partly damaged in the bombing of the Tartu Art Museum and some may have been destroyed in the fire at the Art Museum of Estonia.  

Today, Konrad Mägi’s paintings are scattered all around the world and there are no systematic records of the whereabouts of his work. Maie Raitar (1944-2008) was able to find and reinstate to art history dozens of Mägi’s works, but to date her thorough archive has unfortunately also gone missing. In 2018, the Konrad Mägi Foundation was created, and one of its goals was to look for missing works by Mägi. To date, approximately 40 new or previously missing works have been found, which were included in the exhibition &quot;Konrad Mägi. Unseen Paintings&quot; at the Estonian National Museum (13 October 2023 – 7 January 2024) as well as in the accompanying catalogue.

== Letters ==
In addition to Konrad Mägi’s works, his archives also contain letters and postcards sent to his friends and peers. The majority of the existing letters by Konrad Mägi are accessible on the Konrad Mägi webpage https://konradmagi.ee/en/letters/. The original letters are kept in the Cultural Historical Archive [EKLA] of the Estonian Literary Museum, the archives of the Estonian Art Museum [EKM arhiiv], the archives of the Tartu Art Museum [TKM arhiiv], and in a private collection in Helsinki. The annotation [RP] stands for letters published in the monograph by Rudolf Paris (1932), the originals of which have gone missing. In several cases, Paris included only parts of Mägi’s letters. Only those excerpts of letters published by Paris have been included that were direct quotes; Paris’s paraphrases of Mägi’s letters have been left out. For reading feasibility, Konrad Mägi’s greetings with which he ends his letters have also been left out, unless they contain important information.  

Letters to August Vesanto in Russian have been translated into Estonian by Ilona Martson. The letters were retyped by Mareli Reinhold, Liisi Tee, Kadi Kass, Aili Kuldkepp and Aili Grichin. Cf.

<text>The All-Seeing Eye, known to its community of users as ASE, was a game server browser designed by Finnish company UDP Soft. It was created to help online gamers find game servers. ASE took two years to develop and was introduced as shareware on June 15, 2001.

Despite UDP Soft lacking the marketing power of GameSpy, ASE&#x27;s popularity grew. It was sold to Yahoo! for an undisclosed sum in September 2004.

== Yahoo! All-Seeing Eye ==
The purchase by Yahoo! was a defensive move against acquisition activity by CNet and others, and a desire on Yahoo!&#x27;s part to tap into the hard-core gaming market. At the time of the acquisition, All-Seeing Eye had over 12M downloads, and was used by more than a million gamers per month. While some mistakenly assumed the acquisition was in some way a move against &quot;Xfire&quot;, the reality is that Ultimate Arena had only rebranded themselves as XFire a couple of months prior to the ASE acquisition, and announced an impending launch of their product. Further, instant-messaging-based applications such as XFire at its launch, differed from first-generation server browsing applications such as GameSpy 3D (Arcade is second-generation) and All-Seeing Eye and even Roger Wilco &quot;TF Soldiers&quot;. Subsequently, that gap has been closed.

Months later, XFire was the target of a Yahoo! lawsuit over an alleged patent infringement, partly because Xfire&#x27;s two primary developers were previously engineers on the Yahoo! Games team, where they had authored a patent (granted to Yahoo!) on messenger-based game play notification. The legal battle was resolved in January 2006 with details of the settlement remaining unknown.

In March and April 2008 Yahoo! sent emails to ASE subscribers informing them that ASE will be discontinued as of 15 May 2008 and that a $15 refund will be issued to current subscribers.

ASE has now been officially shut down, including all of their tracking servers. All games that previously used the ASE service will no longer display server listings. Yahoo! now redirects users seeking ASE to GameSpy Arcade, which has since been shut down also.

<doc id="401239" wikidata="Q1113730" url="?curid=401239" title="Alberto della Marmora">
<text>Alberto Ferrero La Marmora (or Della Marmora; 7 April 1789 – 18 March 1863) was an Italian soldier and naturalist. He was elder brother to Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, soldier and founder of the Bersaglieri, and to Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, Italian general and statesman.

Born in Turin but educated at the Ecole Militaire de Fontainebleau, graduating in 1807, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant of infantry in the French Army. He was the second of four brothers, all of whom had distinguished military careers. He served under MacDonald in Calabria and in 1809 he joined the army of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, participating in the campaign in Venetia. He fought at the Battle of Bautzen at the age of 24 and following the defeat of the combined Russian and Prussian forces in that engagement he was personally decorated with the Legion d&#x27;Honneur by Napoleon Bonaparte. After Napoleon&#x27;s abdication Marmora gave his allegiance to the House of Savoy, the ruling house of the Kingdom of Sardinia.

Marmora was posted to Sardinia, from where he sent the first specimens of the warbler that bears his name, &quot;Sylvia sarda&quot; or Marmora&#x27;s warbler, to Turin, where his description was read out at the Turin Academy on 28 August 1819.

He was forced to resign his commission during the insurrection of 1820–21, due to his sympathy with the rebels. Three years later, he was recalled to active service, mainly in Sardinia. Despite his liberal sympathies, he rose to the rank of General and in 1840 he was given command of the Royal School of Marines. In 1845 in collaboration with the knight and major Carlo de Candia, he created the large maritime map of Sardinia in 1: 250,000 scale, travel version. He became Governor-General of Sardinia in 1849, eventually retiring to Turin where he died age 73 on 18 March 1863.

He wrote &quot;Viaggio in Sardegna&quot; (Travels in Sardinia) in 1860, which extended the study of the island previously made by Francesco Cetti. Many of the animals collected by La Marmora were sent to Franco Andrea Bonelli at Turin University, and he also corresponded with Bonelli&#x27;s successor, Giuseppe Gené.

The highest point of Sardinia is Punta La Marmora, commemorating the physical and geological surveys of the island Marmora conducted

<doc id="401240" wikidata="Q7577057" url="?curid=401240" title="Spider hole">
<text>In military slang, a spider hole is a type of camouflaged one-man foxhole, similar to a surveillance/hidesite used for observation.

== Etymology ==
The term is usually understood to be an allusion to the camouflaged hole constructed by the trapdoor spider.

According to United States Marine Corps historian Major Chuck Melson, the term originated in the American Civil War, when it meant a hastily dug foxhole.

Following the capture of Saddam Hussein, the American columnist William Safire claimed in the December 15, 2003, issue of the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the term originated in the Vietnam War. According to Safire, one of the characteristics of these holes was that they held a &quot;clay pot large enough to hold a crouching man.&quot; If the pot broke, the soldier was exposed to attack from snakes or spiders, hence the name &quot;spider hole&quot;.

== Design ==
A spider hole is typically a shoulder-deep, protective, round hole, often covered by a camouflaged lid, in which a soldier can stand and fire a weapon. A spider hole differs from a typical foxhole in that a foxhole is usually deeper and designed to emphasize cover rather than concealment.

== Use ==
Spider holes were used during World War II by Japanese forces on many Pacific battlefields, including Leyte in the Philippines and Iwo Jima. They called them for a fancied resemblance to the pots used to catch octopuses in Japan.

Spider holes were also used by fighters of the Viet Cong and soldiers of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam during the Vietnam War as both defensive and offensive fortifications, where VC/PAVN fighters could either seek shelter from combat with ARVN, US or other allied forces, or could conceal themselves in preparation for a surprise attack.

On December 13, 2003, during the Iraq War, American forces in Operation Red Dawn captured Iraqi president Saddam Hussein hiding in what was characterized as a &quot;spider hole&quot; outside an Ad-Dawr farmhouse (near his hometown of Tikrit).

Kamel Hana Gegeo, Hussein&#x27;s valet, food taster and friend, introduced Samira to him. Hussein&#x27;s secret marriage took place while he was married to Sajida Talfah, his first wife and cousin. Sajida was extremely jealous and angry when she found out about his mistress, and her brother Adnan Khairallah complained. Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s son with Sajida, was also angry over his father&#x27;s mistress, took it as an insult to his mother, and believed that his status as heir apparent was threatened. In October 1988, during a party, Uday Hussein murdered Kamel Hana Gegeo in front of horrified guests. While Saddam Hussein declared that Uday would be tried for murder, Gegeo&#x27;s parents and Sajida begged that Uday be pardoned.

In 2002, Shahbandar&#x27;s son from her first marriage, Mohammad Saffi, a resident of New Zealand and a flight engineer with Air New Zealand, was detained in Miami, Florida, US due to lack of a student visa where he planned to undergo flight training.

As of 2004, Shahbandar was acknowledged as the wife of Saddam Hussein by the United Nations.

==Depictions==
Her character was featured heavily in the plot of BBC adaptation of &quot;House of Saddam&quot; and was played by Australian actress Christine Stephen-Daly. In the drama, Shahbandar is portrayed as a schoolteacher, the occupation of Sajida Talfah.

==Possible issue==
In a 2007 &quot;Al Riyadh&quot; interview, Ali Al-Nida Husein Al-Omar, chief of the Bejat subtribe of Al-Bu Nasir, was asked about Saddam&#x27;s son from Samira Shahbandar. The chief replied:

<doc id="401249" wikidata="Q45381" url="?curid=401249" title="List of Babylon 5 episodes">
<text>&quot;Babylon 5&quot; is an American science fiction television series created, produced and largely written by J. Michael Straczynski. The show centers on the Babylon 5 space station: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict during the years 2257–2262. With its prominent use of planned story arcs, the series was often described as a &quot;novel for television&quot;.

The pilot film premiered on February 22, 1993. The regular series aired from January 26, 1994, and ran for five full seasons. Due to Warner corporate structure and policy concerning syndication in general, and syndication of properties produced by the defunct PTEN division in particular, the show has been syndicated only briefly, and did not appear on U.S. television from 2003 through 2018 (though it has aired in other countries). In 2018, the show began airing nightly on the Comet TV Sci-Fi Network. The show spawned six television films and a spin-off series, &quot;Crusade&quot;, which aired in 1999 and ran for 13 episodes. On July 31, 2007, a DVD was released containing two short films about selected characters from the series.

The five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258–2262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season&#x27;s plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race.

Some episodes in the second season were aired out of their intended chronological sequence. Straczynski confirmed that in Season 2, &quot;A Race Through Dark Places&quot; should precede &quot;Soul Mates,&quot; and that &quot;Knives&quot; should precede &quot;In the Shadow of Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum.&quot;

== Series overview ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Episodes ==
=== Pilot film (1993) ===
=== Season 1: &quot;Signs and Portents&quot; (1994) ===
During 2258, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station, assisted by executive officer Susan Ivanova and security chief Michael Garibaldi. The season traces his gradual recollection of his capture by the Minbari during their war with humans. The Minbari came to believe that Sinclair carried the soul of Valen, a revered Minbari leader. Inferring that Minbari souls were being reborn as humans, the Minbari surrendered to avoid further fratricide. This action is a source of internal strife between some Minbari.

Meanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former Centauri dominion which successfully rebelled, are increasing. Seeking for his people to regain their former prominence, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally, Mr. Morden, to strike back at the Narn. On Earth, some humans resent the influence of aliens, and seek to eliminate them from Earth-owned property, including &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

Minbari Ambassador Delenn is revealed to belong to the Grey Council, the Minbari ruling body. She eventually transforms into a Minbari/human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the death of Earth Alliance president Luis Santiago, which the staff of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; believe to have been an assassination.
=== Season 2: &quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot; (1994–1995) ===
Captain John Sheridan assumes the military governance of the station after Sinclair is reassigned, without explanation, to Minbar. He and the command staff discover that now-president Morgan Clark arranged the assassination of President Santiago. Conflict develops between the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; command staff and the Psi Corps, an increasingly autocratic organization which oversees and controls the lives of human telepaths.

Ambassador Mollari, in preparation for the death of the ailing Centauri Emperor, works with Lord Refa to assassinate any challengers to the throne, while continuing to utilize Mr. Morden and his &quot;associates&quot;—the Shadows—against the Narn. When the emperor dies, Mollari and Refa place the emperor&#x27;s unstable nephew, Cartagia, on the throne. Through him they instigate full-scale war with the Narn, using weapons of mass destruction to conquer the Narn homeworld.

Earth&#x27;s government becomes more totalitarian, suppressing dissent and broadcasting propaganda. Kosh and other Vorlons approach Sheridan and reveal themselves to be the enemies of the Shadows, asking for Sheridan&#x27;s help to fight them.

=== Season 3: &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1995–1996) ===
Earth&#x27;s government continues to become more xenophobic, while on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, Sheridan and Delenn, who become romantically involved during the course of the season, create a &quot;conspiracy of light&quot; to try to reveal the truth behind the Shadows&#x27; influence. Historically tense relations between Earth and its Mars colony reach breaking point when Mars declares independence and Earth&#x27;s government declares martial law and attacks. Sheridan, outraged, withdraws &quot;Babylon 5&quot; from the Earth Alliance, supported by the Minbari.

The fate of &quot;Babylon 4&quot; is discovered when Sinclair returns to the station to request Sheridan&#x27;s help: Sinclair had been destined to use time travel to take &quot;Babylon 4&quot; back in time to the previous Shadow war, where he is transformed into the revered Minbari leader, Valen, using the same device Delenn used for her transformation.

Ambassador Mollari realizes his deal with the Shadows has become dangerous and tries to sever ties with Mr. Morden, but fails. Kosh informs Sheridan that the Shadows can be fought with telepaths. The Vorlons attack the Shadows at Sheridan&#x27;s insistence, but the Shadows kill Kosh in retaliation.

Sheridan&#x27;s wife, presumed dead on an archaeological dig on the planet Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum years earlier, arrives at the station and convinces Sheridan to accompany her to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum. The Shadows attempt to force Sheridan to join their cause, their ships threatening &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Sheridan, guided by Kosh&#x27;s words, flies a vessel loaded with explosives into the planet while jumping into a large chasm. The Shadow ships withdraw, but Garibaldi, deployed to defend the station, does not return.

=== Season 4: &quot;No Surrender, No Retreat&quot; (1996–1997) ===
Sheridan returns from Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum with the help of a strange being known as Lorien, who has given Sheridan 20 more years to live. The Vorlons alarm the other races when they begin destroying entire planets that have been influenced by the Shadows. Mollari, fearing the Vorlons will destroy Centauri Prime, destroys the Shadow base there and executes Mr. Morden. Sheridan learns that the Vorlons and Shadows were tasked as caretakers for younger races in the galaxy, but due to profound differences in ideology have been at war for eons, using the younger races as pawns in a proxy war. With the help of other ancient races, Sheridan convinces the Vorlons and Shadows to leave and cease interfering with the younger races.

Garibaldi returns to &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, with no explanation for his disappearance. He has unexplained changes in behavior and distances himself from the command staff, resigning and relocating to Mars to work with tycoon William Edgars. He also subdues Sheridan, allowing the latter to be kidnapped. It is revealed that Garibaldi was co-opted by the Psi-Corps to spy on Edgars, who is found to be developing a virus to destroy telepaths.

With the Vorlons and Shadows gone, Earth&#x27;s totalitarian government attempts to use the captured Sheridan as a propaganda tool, but Garibaldi - now free from Psi-Corps influence - rescues him. A brief civil war breaks out on Earth, culminating in President Clark&#x27;s suicide and Sheridan&#x27;s surrender to Earth forces. Ivanova is critically injured in the war, and leaves the station to take command of her own vessel.

The League of Non-Aligned Worlds are reorganized into an Interstellar Alliance with Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri acting as a United Nations across the galaxy, with the Rangers as their enforcers. Sheridan is made president of the Alliance, and he and Delenn marry.

=== Season 5: &quot;The Wheel of Fire&quot; (1998) ===
In 2262, Earthforce Captain Elizabeth Lochley is appointed to command &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, which is now also the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance. A conflict arises between Psi-Corps and a group of rogue telepaths that are seeking their own homeworld after learning that the Vorlons created telepaths as weapons against the Shadows. When several telepaths martyr themselves, Lyta leads attacks against the Psi-Corps, becoming an enemy of the state.

Alliance trade and civilian ships are being attacked by an unknown force, and evidence is discovered that the Centauri may be involved. Mollari discovers that the Drakh, a Shadow-allied race, have forced the Centauri leadership to precipitate war with the Alliance, in part as revenge for Mollari&#x27;s turn against the Shadows. Mollari is forced to co-operate when he becomes Emperor and withdraws the Centauri from the Alliance. Vir becomes the Centauri ambassador on the station.

Separate stories show the long-standing members of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; making plans to leave the station: Sheridan and Delenn move to the Alliance&#x27;s permanent headquarters on Minbar. Garibaldi, having relapsed in his alcoholism, is aided by Lise and the two marry and return to Mars. Dr. Franklin takes a position on Earth as head of xenobiology. G&#x27;Kar discovers he has become a religious figure and unable to stay on the station or return to Narn, exiles himself to travel the galaxy, taking Lyta with him since she is in a similar position.

Twenty years after his return from Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum, Sheridan feels his life fading. He has the Rangers gather his old friends on Minbar for a farewell party. The next day, Sheridan attempts to leave while Delenn is asleep but she stops him to say a final goodbye. Alone, Sheridan revisits &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, now being decommissioned, before continuing to the location of the final Vorlon–Shadow encounter. Drawing his last breaths, he is met by Lorien, who invites Sheridan to travel beyond the galactic rim. Sheridan&#x27;s ship is found adrift and empty some days later.

<text>Ralphs is an American supermarket chain in Southern California. The largest subsidiary of Cincinnati-based Kroger, it is the oldest such chain west of the Mississippi River. Kroger also operates stores under the Food 4 Less and Foods Co. names in California.

==History==

Ralphs Grocery Company was founded in 1873 in Los Angeles by George Albert Ralphs and his brother, Walter Benjamin Ralphs. Ralphs teamed with S. A. Francis in 1873 to open the Ralphs &amp; Francis store at 5th and Hill – an area which would become the Historic Core of the city in the early 20th century, but was then a mostly residential area with many single-family houses. In 1875, Ralphs’s brother Walter bought out Francis’s share, and the business became the Ralphs Bros. Grocers, specializing in produce. The business boomed. In 1876, they constructed a two-story building at the southwest corner of Sixth and Spring.

In the 20th century, Ralphs became a grocery pioneer, offering self-service markets with checkout stands in distributed locations. The company employed notable architects in designing its stores, and the former Ralphs Grocery Store building built in 1929 in Westwood Village has been photographed by Ansel Adams, declared a Historic Cultural Monument, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1980s, it created a chain of hybrid supermarket/warehouse stores called The Giant, which failed, but the concept returned with the company&#x27;s merger with the Food 4 Less discount chain. In 1968, Ralphs was acquired by Federated Department Stores, based in Cincinnati.

In 1988, Canada-based Campeau Corporation launched a $4.2 billion hostile takeover of Federated, Ralphs&#x27;s parent. Ralphs would then be put up for sale, with American Stores (owner of rival chain Lucky) making an offer.

In 1992, Federated, now known as Macy&#x27;s, Inc., sold Ralphs to a group of owners, led by Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, after filing for bankruptcy two years earlier in 1990. In 1994, Ralphs was acquired by the Yucaipa Companies for $1.5 billion. Yucaipa owned ABC Markets, Alpha Beta, , and Cala Foods. Soon, all ABC Markets, Alpha Betas, and Boys Markets were rebranded as Ralphs. At the same time, Food 4 Less was merged with Ralphs. In 1997, Yucaipa sold Ralphs to Portland, Oregon based Fred Meyer, owner of several chains in the west. Soon, Ralphs Marketplace stores started opening in suburban areas; these stores are based on the Fred Meyer model but without apparel. At the same time, they also acquired the 57-store Hughes Family Markets chain. In October 1998, the parent company, Fred Meyer, merged with Kroger of Cincinnati, Ohio.

In 1999, Ralphs purchased about 30 Albertsons and Lucky stores, mostly in Northern California, as well as stores in the Central Coast region, and one store each in Bakersfield and Laguna Beach. The stores were divested as a result of the Albertsons and American Stores merger and marked the chain&#x27;s reentry into Northern California after a short-lived expansion in the 1970s.

In 2005, Ralphs exited the Bakersfield market, closing 3 stores.

Ralphs operated in Northern California until January 2006, when they announced that all but one Ralphs in northern California would close. In August 2006, the one remaining Ralphs in northern California, in Grass Valley, was given a 60-day notice of closure, ending Ralphs&#x27; presence in northern California for the second time. Also, in August 2006, Ralphs finalized plans to sell eleven (of thirteen remaining) Cala-Bell Stores to Harley DeLano, who previously ran the chain.

On July 20, 2007, Ralphs opened a new store on 9th and Hope Street in the South Park neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles. This was the first full-run supermarket downtown in 50 years. In 1950, Ralphs closed a store at 7th Street and Figueroa Street.

In 2023, Ralphs President Tom Schwilke announced plans to open a new Ralphs store within the next two years, the first new store opening in over 10 years.

Today, Ralphs competes with Albertsons (including Vons) and Stater Bros. Its slogan is &quot;Fresh for Everyone,&quot; also used by all other Kroger grocery store brands. Ralphs is the current market share leader in Southern California.
==2003–04 strike==

Ralphs Grocery Company has contracts with the United Food and Commercial Workers, the largest grocery union in the United States. In late 2003 and early 2004, Ralphs locked out its workers who were members of the UFCW in sympathy with competitor Vons (owned by Safeway Inc.) in Southern California, after the UFCW had declared a strike against Vons. The issues in contract negotiations included healthcare benefits and wage structure, which the supermarkets contended were necessary to reduce costs and remain competitive in the face of the rise of discount chains like Walmart. In March 2004, the strike ended with a settlement regarded as a victory for the grocery chains—new hires would be on a much lower pay scale than existing workers and receive less generous health benefits.

On October 16, 2006, Ralphs agreed to pay $70 million to settle felony charges that it illegally rehired locked out employees using false names and Social Security numbers during the strike. Eligible UFCW members received $50 million of the settlement and the remainder was paid in fines to the federal government.

<text>Live ?!★꩜ Like a Suicide is an EP by American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, released on December 16, 1986, on the UZI Suicide record label. When referred to by band members, they have simply called the EP &quot;Live Like a Suicide&quot;. It is a faux live recording, with crowd noises added in the studio, as the band was told it would be too expensive to record an actual live recording. The record itself was reportedly limited to only 10,000 copies, released only in vinyl and cassette formats.

The tracks were later re-released along with four new songs as the album &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; (1988).

In 2018, they were included as bonus tracks on the reissue of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; and featured seamless crowd noise between the songs along with a fifth song, &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot;.

==Background==
The four songs on the EP were selected from the band&#x27;s demo tapes: two are cover versions and two are originals. The EP was a faux-live recording with overdubbed crowd noise, but these are in fact studio performances.

According to Steven Adler&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Appetite for Destruction: Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;, the entire EP was recorded at Pasha Studios in Hollywood with pre-recorded audience applause and cheering in the background, as Geffen&#x27;s engineers told him &quot;it would cost too much to actually record a live record&quot;. Duff McKagan says in his autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy (and other Lies)&quot;, that &quot;the crowd noise...is from a 1970&#x27;s rock festival called the Texxas Jam. We thought it would be funny to put a &quot;huge&quot; stadium crowd in the background at a time when we were lucky to be playing to a few hundred.&quot;

&quot;Reckless Life&quot; is the opening track on the EP. It opens with Slash shouting &quot;Hey fuckers! Suck on Guns N&#x27; fuckin&#x27; Roses!&quot; This song was originally written by Hollywood Rose, which had included all the members of Guns N&#x27; Roses except Duff McKagan at one point or another. It was included in the Hollywood Rose compilation album &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;. 
&quot;Nice Boys&quot; is a cover of a song by Rose Tattoo. &quot;Move to the City&quot; features a horn section and is also from the Hollywood Rose era. The fourth track on the EP is &quot;Mama Kin&quot; which is a cover of a song by Aerosmith, a band Guns N&#x27; Roses has cited as one of their major influences.

One song considered for this EP was &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot;, which never made it onto the album, and later released on the &quot;It’s So Easy/Mr. Brownstone&quot; single and the &quot;Live from the Jungle&quot; EP.

==Artwork==
The front cover consists of a photograph of two of the band members, Duff McKagan and Axl Rose (from left to right), with an early Guns N&#x27; Roses logo, designed by Slash, overhead.

==Promotion==
To celebrate the release of the EP Guns N&#x27; Roses had a release party at Riki Rachtman&#x27;s World Famous Cathouse. That was the first live performance at the club. It was acoustic and this was before MTV had the unplugged series, so an acoustic set from a heavy metal act was rather obscure in 1986. In 2010, Steven Adler claimed that Guns N&#x27; Roses got Rodney on the ROQ at KROQ-FM to initially play &quot;Reckless Life&quot; by giving Rodney one gram of cocaine.

==Critical reception==

In April 1987, &quot;Sounds&quot; critic Paul Elliott called it a &quot;trashy, fun but so-so&quot; EP but nonetheless commented that the music had an &quot;air plastering of dirt &#x27;n&#x27; grime and down-at-heel seediness&quot; that was still evident in the demo material for &quot;Appetite for Deconstruction&quot;. Two months later, Sylvie Simmons wrote in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that the &quot;delirious&quot; indie EP was &quot;a greasy, lemon-squeezy slice of smirking, strutting vinyl.&quot; Describing it as an &quot;indie bar-band object&quot;, critic Chuck Eddy considers the EP to comprise &quot;by-the-numbers Aerosmtih and Rose Tattoo speedboogie reconstructions and a couple ballsy-but-inconsequential speedboogie originals.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; consider the EP to comprise &quot;four pleasantly raw live tracks&quot;. In his &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: &quot;&quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot; is competent bar band boogie, without the energy or danger of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;.&quot;

<text>G N&#x27; R Lies (also known simply as Lies) is the second studio album by American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, released by Geffen Records on November 29, 1988. It is the band&#x27;s shortest studio album, running at 33 and a half minutes. The album reached number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and according to the RIAA, has shipped over five million copies in the United States.

&quot;Patience&quot;, the only single released from &quot;Lies&quot;, peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on June 3, 1989. This is the band&#x27;s last full album to feature drummer Steven Adler following his departure in 1990, shortly after the single &quot;Civil War&quot; was recorded, and featured on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; (1991), as well as their last album to be recorded as five-piece band members.

==Background and recording==
===&quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;===
The first four tracks consist of the previously released EP &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;. These four tracks were also included as bonus tracks on the 2018 reissue of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;.

=== &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; ===
The last four songs were recorded with acoustic guitars. They were written and recorded in only a few studio sessions (with the exception of &quot;You&#x27;re Crazy&quot;, which appeared in an alternative version on &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;), which producer Mike Clink called &quot;one of those magical rock and roll history moments&quot;.

In later interviews, Axl Rose stated that while he loved how the band sounded on the last four songs, he hated the sound of his voice. Rose recalled that his voice was husky and scratchy from the band&#x27;s lengthy touring at the time, and if he could he would have re-recorded his vocal tracks in a separate session.

A significantly faster version of &quot;You&#x27;re Crazy&quot; with electric guitars had previously been released on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, and was now recorded as originally intended. 
&quot;Used to Love Her&quot; was written as a joke after Izzy Stradlin disliked a song he heard on the radio featuring &quot;some guy whining about a broad who was treating him bad&quot;. Slash stated that &quot;People think it&#x27;s about one of our old girlfriends, but it&#x27;s actually about Axl&#x27;s dog.&quot;

Three of the four songs from the &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; EP are included on the 2018 remastered release of the album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, with the exception of the controversial &quot;One in a Million&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover is a parody of tabloid newspapers, as are the liner notes. The album&#x27;s cover art underwent several minor modifications when the title was released on CD, though early pressings of the CD retain the original cover art. First, in the bottom left corner reading &quot;LIES LIES LIES&quot; originally read &quot;Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years.&quot; Secondly, instead of &quot;Elephant gives birth to midget&quot;, the original headline reads, &quot;Ladies, welcome to the dark ages.&quot; Many copies of the original LP release also contained an uncensored picture of a nude model on the inner LP sleeve.

==Controversy==

The song &quot;One in a Million&quot; has caused controversy and raised accusations of racism, homophobia and nativism due to the lyrics, which include the slurs &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot;. Rose denied that he was a racist and defended his use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, claiming that &quot;it&#x27;s a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean black.&quot; He cited the rap group N.W.A and the John Lennon song &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot; as other examples of musicians using the word. Several years later, Rose conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people who had tried to rob him, and because the word is a taboo. In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself &quot;pro-heterosexual&quot; and blamed this attitude on &quot;bad experiences&quot; with gay men.

Although initially against the song, other members of the band have since defended the song, claiming it was misunderstood. Nevertheless, the song was not included in future compilation releases that otherwise included all the other tracks on &quot;Lies&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in a 4 out of 5 star review, stated &quot;Given that Guns N&#x27; Roses could probably release an album of Baptist hymns at this point and go platinum, it would be all too easy to dismiss G n&#x27; R Lies as a sneaky attempt by the band to throw together some outtakes and cash in on the busy holiday buying season ... The good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that ... The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns N&#x27; Roses. They should also end any further mutterings from the doubting Thomases out there who are still making snide comments about the band&#x27;s potential for longevity.&quot; AllMusic, in a 3.5 out of 5 review, criticized some of the songs on the acoustic side, stating &quot;Constructed as a double EP, with the &quot;indie&quot; debut Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide coming first and four new acoustic-based songs following on the second side, G N&#x27; R Lies is where the band metamorphosed from genuine threat to joke. Neither recorded live nor released by an indie label, Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide is competent bar band boogie, without the energy or danger of Appetite for Destruction. The new songs are considerably more problematic. &quot;Patience&quot; is Guns N&#x27; Roses at their prettiest and their sappiest, the most direct song they recorded to date. Its emotional directness makes the misogyny of &quot;Used to Love Her (But I Had to Kill Her)&quot; and the pitiful slanders of &quot;One in a Million&quot; sound genuine.

In a negative review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau stated &quot;Axl&#x27;s voice is a power tool with attachments, Slash&#x27;s guitar a hype, the groove potent &quot;hard rock&quot;, and the songwriting not without its virtues. So figure musical quality at around C plus and take the grade as a call to boycott, a reminder to clean livers who yearn for the wild side that the &quot;necessary&quot; link between sex-and-drugs and rock-and-roll is a Hollywood fantasy&quot; while condemning &quot;One In a Million&quot; and &quot;Used To Love Her&quot;.

In a 2014 review, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; dissected the controversy around the album, stating &quot;Conceived as a stop-gap release, the second Guns N&#x27; Roses album remains a remarkable one-off – in every sense. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; stated &quot;Ironically, G N&#x27; R Lies&#x27; tabloid-style cover art also hinted at the incessant scandals and resulting paranoia that would soon engulf the band, and its singer in particular, sowing the seeds to their eventual dissolution after the twin &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; behemoths, and protracted creative silence until 2008&#x27;s historically delayed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; opus.&quot;

<text>SS &quot;Chelyuskin&quot; () was a Soviet steamship, reinforced to navigate through polar ice, that in 1934 became ice-bound in Arctic waters during a navigation along the Northern Maritime Route from Murmansk to Vladivostok and sank. 111 people were on board the Chelyuskin, and all but one were rescued by air. The expedition&#x27;s task was to determine the possibility to travel by non-icebreaker through the Northern Maritime Route in a single navigation season.

It was built in Denmark in 1933 by Burmeister and Wain (B&amp;W, Copenhagen) and named after the 18th century Russian polar explorer Semion Ivanovich Chelyuskin. The head of the expedition was Otto Yuliyevich Shmidt and the ship&#x27;s captain was V. I. Voronin. There were 111 people on board the steamship, including Soviet cinematographers Mark Troyanovsky and Arkadii Shafran who documented on film the entire voyage, including the rescue. The crew members were known as &quot;Chelyuskintsy&quot;, with the singular form &quot;Chelyuskinets&quot;.

==Mission==

After leaving Murmansk on 2 August 1933, the steamship managed to get through most of the Northern Route before it was caught in the ice fields in September. Eight members of the crew had been dropped off at Kolyuchin Island, so there were 104 people on board including 10 women and two small children. One of the children was only 6 months old: geodesicist Vasily Vasiliev&#x27;s daughter Karina, born on August 31, 1933, during the voyage in the Kara Sea. After becoming icebound, the ship drifted in the ice pack before sinking on 13 February 1934, crushed by the icepacks near Kolyuchin Island in the Chukchi Sea. During the wreck one crew member, B. G. Mogilevich, was killed by deck cargo. The survivors made a camp on the ice floe. The women and children were airlifted out by Anatoly Liapidevsky on March 5 after 29 rescue flight attempts, but the men in the crew were not rescued until April after over two months on the ice. The crew managed to escape onto the ice and built a makeshift airstrip using only a few spades, ice shovels and two crowbars. They had to rebuild the airstrip thirteen times, until they were rescued in April of the same year and flown to the village of Vankarem on the coast of the sea. From there, some of the Chelyuskinites were flown further to the village of Uelen, while fifty-three men walked over 300 miles to get there.

The aircraft pilots who took part in search and rescue operations were the first people to receive the newly established highest title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Those pilots were Anatoly Liapidevsky, Sigizmund Levanevsky (who crashed en route to the camp, but survived), Vasily Molokov, Mavriky Slepnyov, Mikhail Vodopianov, Nikolai Kamanin and Ivan Doronin. Liapidevsky flew an ANT-4, the civilian version of the TB-1 heavy bomber, while Slepnev and Levanevsky flew a Consolidated Fleetster specially brought in from the US for the mission, and the other pilots flew the Polikarpov R-5. Two American air mechanics, Clyde Goodwin Armitstead, and William Latimer Lavery, also helped in the search and rescue of the &quot;Chelyuskintsy&quot;, on 10 September 1934, and were awarded the Order of Lenin.

As the steamship became trapped at the entrance to the Bering Strait, the USSR considered the expedition mainly successful, as it had proven that a regular steamship had a chance to navigate the whole Northern Maritime Route in a single season. After a few additional trial runs in 1933 and 1934, the Northern Sea Route was officially opened and commercial exploitation began in 1935. The following year part of the Soviet Baltic Fleet made the passage to the Pacific where an armed conflict with Japan was looming.

==Legacy==
In the wake of the catastrophe, a central square in Yaroslavl was renamed after the &quot;Chelyuskintsy&quot;, as was Chelyuskinites Park in Minsk. Marina Tsvetayeva wrote a poem applauding the rescue team. Nine days after the two Soviet cameramen aboard reached Moscow, their footage was developed, edited and released as a feature documentary motion picture. In 1970, East German television produced &quot;Tscheljuskin&quot;, a film about the ship&#x27;s voyage, directed by Rainer Hausdorf and featuring Eberhard Mellies as Prof. Schmidt, Dieter Mann as the surveyor Vasiliev and Fritz Diez as Valerian Kuybyshev.

Efforts to find the wreck of the ship were made by at least four different expeditions, and it was finally discovered in September 2006, at a depth of about 50 metres in the Chukchi Sea. The polar explorer Artur Chilingarov argued that the ship should be raised and converted into a museum.

Michael Roberts, an English poet, wrote a poem &quot;Chelyuskin&quot;, which was included in his collection &quot;Poems,&quot; published by Jonathan Cape in 1936.

The story was dramatised in the radio drama &quot;The Cruise of the Chelyuskin&quot;.

<text>A cornerback (CB) is a member of the defensive backfield or secondary in gridiron football. Cornerbacks cover receivers most of the time, but also blitz and defend against such offensive running plays as sweeps and reverses. They create turnovers through hard tackles, interceptions, and deflecting forward passes.

Other members of the defensive backfield include strong and free safeties.

The cornerback position requires speed, agility, strength, and the ability to make rapid sharp turns. A cornerback&#x27;s skill set typically requires proficiency in anticipating the quarterback, backpedaling, executing single and zone coverage, disrupting pass routes, block shedding, and tackling. Cornerbacks are among the fastest players on the field. Because of this, they are frequently used as return specialists on punts or kickoffs.

== Overview ==
The cornerback&#x27;s chief responsibility is to defend against the offense&#x27;s pass. The rules of American professional football and American college football do not mandate starting position, movement, or coverage zones for any member of the defense. There are no &quot;illegal defense&quot; formations. Cornerbacks can be anywhere on the defensive side of the line of scrimmage at the start of play, although their proximity, formations, and strategies are outlined by the coaching staff or captain. Examples of cornerbacks in the NFL are Jalen Ramsey, Patrick Surtain II, Marlon Humphrey, Jaire Alexander, Sauce Gardner, L&#x27;Jarius Sneed, and Charvarius Ward.

Most modern National Football League defensive formations use four defensive backs (two safeties and two corners); Canadian Football League defenses generally use five defensive backs (one safety, two defensive halfbacks, and two corners). A cornerback&#x27;s responsibilities vary depending on how the defense assigns protection to its defensive secondary. In terms of defending the run, often corners may be assigned to blitz depending on the coaching decisions in a game. In terms of defending passing plays, a corner will be typically assigned to either zone or man-to-man coverage.

The most effective cornerbacks are typically called &quot;lockdown corners&quot;. These elite defenders cover an offensive receiver so effectively on either side of the field that the quarterback does not target the receiver being covered.

===Zone===
In zone coverage, the cornerback defends an assigned area of the field. Many schemes and variations were created to provide defensive coordinators great latitude and flexibility which aim to thwart offensive schemes.

When a team is using zone coverage, some areas of the field require special attention when defending against specific pass plays. They include the flats (to defend the screen pass and hitch routes), mid range zones including the void (to defend the &quot;stop n go&quot;, quick post, fade, hook, curl, and &quot;sideline&quot; or &quot;out&quot; routes), and finally the deep zones (to defend the post/deep post, chair, streak, &quot;fly&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, bomb, or Hail Mary routes). These are basic terms (perhaps the most generic) for the basic zones and routes which vary system to system, league to league, and team to team.

Advanced forms of coverage may involve &quot;quarterback spies&quot; and &quot;containment&quot; coverages, as well as various &quot;on field adjustments&quot; that require shifts and rotations; the latter usually initiated by the captain of the secondary (typically the free safety) during the quarterback&#x27;s cadence. At this time the captain attempts to &quot;read&quot; the alignment (pro set, split set, trips, etc.) of the offensive &quot;skill players&quot; (backs and receivers) in order to best predict and counter the play the offense will run. He will base his decision on past experience, game preparation, and a sound comprehension of his teammates strengths, abilities, and tendencies. These adjustments may change on a play by play basis, due to substitutions or even evolving weather or field conditions. For example, defensive coordinators may favor a tendency to play a less aggressive containment style zone coverage during wet or slippery field conditions to avoid problems associated with over-pursuit (when a defender takes a poor angle on a ball carrier and cannot redirect in time due to poor footing).

===Cover 1===
The Cover 1 defense is an aggressive formation employed against offenses trying to gain short yardage. In the Cover 1 defense, one defender—normally a safety—plays deep zone downfield, providing security over the top and freeing the other safety to rush the line of scrimmage or drop back into coverage. Meanwhile, the corner&#x27;s primary responsibility is to play on or off the receiver and not release him vertically. Defensive coordinators typically call for Cover 1 formations only when their cornerbacks are skilled at playing man-to-man coverage.

===Cover 2===
The Cover 2 formation, which deploys four defensive backs in a &quot;two-deep zone&quot;, is popular among NFL defensive coordinators because it uses two safeties to defend the deep routes instead of one. The safeties line up on or near their respective hashmarks between 11 and 15 yards off the line of scrimmage, while the cornerbacks line up around five yards from the wide receivers nearest to each sideline. With the safeties able to watch the play develop in front of them, the corners are free to pursue a more aggressive style of play.

In Cover 2, the cornerback is usually responsible for &quot;containment&quot;, meaning that he is tasked with preventing any eligible receiver or ball carrier from running between him and the sideline. He funnels receivers toward the middle of the field and may physically &quot;jam&quot; them within five yards of the line of scrimmage in order to disrupt their assigned routes. If he determines that the offense is not attempting a running play or a pass into the flat, he then drops back to defend the secondary. This is often referred to as the &quot;catch-and-run&quot; technique. Typically, cornerbacks mirror each other&#x27;s zone responsibilities. However, sometimes they play a &quot;man-up&quot; style of bump-and-run coverage designed to eliminate the short pass, where the receiver is forced to the near sideline, which is the opposite of the run-oriented &quot;containment&quot; style of Cover 2.

===Cover 3===
In a &quot;Cover 3&quot;, the two corners and free safety defend their assigned deep thirds of the field, where the corners defend the outside thirds, (hence the term corner) while the safety defends the middle third. This allows the strong safety to address a full range of duties depending on what reads he makes coupled with the coverage called. These duties may simply include single or zone coverage, being a quarterback spy, providing extra run support in short yardage situations, or to stunt or blitz through a gap or from the end.

===Cover 4===
In a &quot;Cover 4&quot; each defensive back is responsible for covering his designated &quot;deep fourth&quot; of the field, while other defensive players are responsible for covering the underneath areas. Sometimes Cover 4 is used as a &quot;prevent defense&quot;.

Variations of these coverages exist to counter the many styles of offenses a defense may face on any given week. For example, one variation of the Cover 2 allocates the weak-side corner (e.g.: typically the &quot;right cornerback&quot; when playing against right-handed quarterbacks) to cover half the field in order to free up a safety; the idea being to allow the safety to engage a different part of the field, blitz, contain, or spy. The strong side cornerback (the &quot;left cornerback&quot;) may be in a variety of different alignments which may include &quot;loose man&quot;, &quot;man-under&quot;, or &quot;man-up&quot;. Although these are forms of single coverage, more often than not his responsibility is usually limited to an initial jam and funnel with a subsequent drop back into the &quot;void&quot;. This pie-shaped slice of field is included with your most basic 2 Deep Zone coverage. One interesting aspect sometimes encountered with Cover 2 is that it is possible for one corner to be in a zone coverage, where he funnels and drops into the void, while another may be in man coverage. However, your basic garden variety 2 Deep Zone usually employs the two safeties to share half the field responsibilities, with the two corners funneling.

==Jamming the receiver==
When a cornerback is attempting to jam a receiver, he is trying to disrupt the receiver&#x27;s route at the line of scrimmage. Many routes are precisely coordinated between the quarterback and the receiver, to the point that a quarterback may throw the ball without looking, knowing his receiver will be in an exact spot after a certain time. Jamming will disrupt the timing between the two, which provides the defense with extra time to sack the quarterback (sometimes called a &quot;coverage sack&quot;), or force an ill-timed throw that misses the target. In addition, a proper jam allows the safety or linebacker to provide stronger run support because he then has more time to drop back into zone coverage in the event of a pass. In other words, he has been granted more time by the corner to recover from his mistakes if he anticipates a run when in fact the play is a pass.

Proper jamming technique requires the cornerback to use their legs, shoulder width apart. At the same time, the cornerback thrusts their arms forward into the receiver&#x27;s chest to maximize power. When properly executed, a jam can knock a receiver off his feet. Jamming is only legal within five yards from the line of scrimmage.

If the jam fails, the cornerback is usually flat footed and not in a suitable position to defend the mid to long-range passes. When this occurs, the safeties and linebackers usually cannot return to their zone obligations in time, especially if they were anticipating a run as the play began. In essence, the defense is unnecessarily &quot;stretched&quot; to its breaking point. Receivers who can effectively avoid the jam and stretch defenses are far more likely to create big play opportunities for the offense. Therefore, it is vital that a cornerback execute a proper funnel or jam to allow safeties and linebackers enough time to return to their zone responsibilities in the event of an unforeseen pass play. By working together and familiarizing where one&#x27;s help may come from, a higher degree of confidence is established among the defensive secondary as a unit, with the result translating into a much more formidable defense against both the run and pass.

==Single/man-to-man coverage==
In single or man to man coverage, the cornerback is responsible for a particular receiver assigned to him. As the play begins, the corner may either attempt to &quot;jam&quot; the receiver at the line, play a step or two off of him, or concede a few yards and play with a &quot;cushion&quot;. Cushions can range from a yard or two, to forty yards in a &quot;prevent defense&quot; situation. Cushion is just how far off the defender plays away from the offensive player he is assigned to defend. When lining up in front of the receiver to &quot;jam&quot; him or playing just a few steps off, it is important that the corner keeps his body in front of the receiver&#x27;s body. The easiest way for a corner to be in position is to line up slightly inside of the receiver and the ball, and keep his eyes looking between the receiver&#x27;s hip and his knees. If a cornerback loses focus on his receiver, the receiver will run straight past him, and then it leads to corners having to use the cushion technique. Generally, cushions are smaller in single coverage and larger in zone coverage.

Single coverage in the &quot;red zone&quot; – the area between the twenty-yard line and the goal line – is usually designed to prevent receivers from slanting towards the middle of the field. These types of routes are difficult to stop in the red zone because this area is usually congested with bodies colliding, crossing, and weaving in different directions. Although illegal, defenders are easily picked or screened by opposing receivers and sometimes by their own teammates; this is illegal yet difficult to enforce in short field, congested situations. To avoid this, it is often favorable for cornerbacks to either: &quot;switch&quot; assignments, where he will agree beforehand to trade assignments with one of his fellow defenders if the receivers criss-cross as the play begins, or alternatively, if a corner may instead line up very close to the receiver at the line of scrimmage to force or &quot;jam&quot; him toward the sideline (outside) without violating the 5-yard no-touch rule. Corners often refer to this second style of coverage as the &quot;man under&quot; technique.

Single coverage, or man to man coverage usually employs relatively few techniques. However, they are often initially displayed to resemble one another as much as possible to disguise the true motives of the defense, and be interchangeable as well. Although terminology for single coverage can vary, a few generic terms have been included to establish a general understanding of cornerback philosophy and how his function relates to the rest of the defense.

===Loose man===
Loose man requires cornerbacks to play off the receiver with a five to ten yard cushion. He usually does not touch the receiver and tries to keep his head on a swivel in order to move in whatever direction the receiver decides to shape his route. Typically with loose man coverage, the cornerback has little or no help from the safety in defending against the receiver.

This defense is used to discourage deeper passes, but often allows short yardage passes. A loose-man defense looks to create confusion for the quarterback by using blitzes. The idea is to disrupt the coordination necessary for short routes, which leads to drops or poorly thrown passes stalling the drive. However, accurate quarterbacks with a quick release of the football can exploit this and routinely make 3 to 5 yard completions to receivers.

===Man up===
By far the most challenging, the man up technique grants the wide receiver a relatively free release as the corner shadows him stride for stride everywhere he goes. The cornerback&#x27;s objective here is to position himself between the quarterback and the receiver, without knowing where the receiver is going. As the ball is snapped the corner will initially ignore the quarterback, turn and run with the receiver and hope the ball does not drop out of the sky before he can react to it. Corners must also hope the receiver does not change directions when it is time to sneak a peek at the quarterback in effort to discover where the ball is. A wet field makes this coverage extremely difficult. In addition, a perfect throw is hard, if not impossible, to stop. This coverage is usually reserved for the elite cornerback with superb coverage skills.

<doc id="401278" wikidata="Q1136084" url="?curid=401278" title="The Trouble with Tribbles">
<text>&quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by David Gerrold and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast on December 29, 1967. In this comic episode, the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; visits a space station that soon becomes overwhelmed by rapidly reproducing small furry creatures called &quot;tribbles&quot;.

It is claimed the short story &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; by Ellis Parker Butler inspired the episode, but strong similarities to sections of the novel &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; led the producers to seek a waiver from author Robert A. Heinlein.

The original episode has had several produced follow-ups. The first, &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;, was originally pitched for the show&#x27;s third season but not accepted; it was ultimately produced for &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1996, the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; used digital techniques to insert the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; actors into the events of &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;.

==Plot==
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is summoned to Deep Space Station K7 by undersecretary Nilz Baris to guard a shipment of quadrotriticale grain. Captain James Kirk is annoyed at Baris&#x27;s use of a high-priority distress call for a seemingly trivial matter, and complies minimally. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew enjoy shore leave on the station, as does the crew of a Klingon ship under the command of Captain Koloth.

Interstellar trader Cyrano Jones arrives with goods for sale, among them purring balls of fluff called tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura, who takes it aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. On both the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the station, the tribbles begin reproducing rapidly. They make soothing cooing noises and are loved by the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, even the stoic Spock. However, tribbles jump and screech in disgust when around Klingons.

On the station, a drunken Klingon insults the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, her crew, and her captain. The resulting brawl between humans and Klingons forces Kirk to cancel shore leave. Baris is terrified of possible Klingon interference with the grain project, and suspects Jones of being a Klingon agent.

Doctor Leonard McCoy and Spock are concerned that the increasing number of tribbles threatens to consume all the food aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Kirk realizes that the tribbles on the station could be a threat to the grain shipment. He is too late, however; when he opens an overhead storage compartment, he is buried chest-deep in grain-gorged tribbles. Spock and McCoy discover that many of the tribbles in the hold are dead or dying, suggesting the grain has been poisoned.

Infuriated, Baris vows to see Kirk punished for the fiasco, while an equally outraged Koloth demands an apology from Kirk for what he considers disrespectful treatment of his crew. Their arguments are cut short, however, when Baris&#x27;s assistant Arne Darvin walks into the room and the tribbles react as if in the presence of a Klingon. McCoy reveals Darvin to be a Klingon disguised as a human; Darvin confesses to having poisoned the grain.

Jones is ordered to remove the tribbles from the station (a task that Spock estimates will take 17.9 years), or he may face charges for transporting dangerous life-forms. Just before the Klingons depart, all the tribbles aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; are transported onto the Klingon vessel by Chief Engineer Scott, where, in his words, &quot;they&#x27;ll be no tribble at all.&quot;

==Production==
===Writing===
The episode was the first professional work of writer David Gerrold, and went through a variety of drafts before it reached the screen. Because his typewriter used a less common, smaller size font, an approved screenplay version needed to be reduced by twenty pages before filming.

Gerrold had been a fan of science fiction since he was a child. When &quot;Star Trek&quot; was first broadcast, he was concerned that it might turn into something similar to &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, which he has described as &quot;one full-color hour of trash reaching into millions of homes&quot;. His first story outline was sent in to &quot;Star Trek&quot; after his agent suggested that he wait until the shows started to air under the theory that the show might drop an existing episode in favor of a better script. The story was entitled &quot;Tomorrow Was Yesterday&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;) and concerned the &quot;Enterprise&quot; coming across a generation ship which had degenerated into a two-tier class system. His agent received a rejection letter from producer Gene L. Coon dated October 3, 1966. The letter stated that the &quot;outline was by no means inadequate. It is, as a matter of fact, very adequate.&quot; It went on to say that it would require a budget larger than that available to television, but would have made a good film treatment. Coon offered to meet with Gerrold and explain what they were looking for, because they were not purchasing scripts at that time.

Coon suggested that Gerrold should wait until the following February to see if the show was renewed for a second season. They also discussed several story ideas, including some small furry creatures that bred too quickly. Coon thought it was a cute idea but would be too expensive as they&#x27;d have to build each creature. In preparation for the second series submission, by January, Gerrold had put together five premises to pitch. He had his best hopes on two treatments called &quot;Bandi&quot; and &quot;The Protracted Man&quot;, but decided to submit his fifth story despite Coon&#x27;s earlier dismissal of the idea. It was called &quot;The Fuzzies&quot;. The idea was based on the introduction of rabbits in Australia in 1859, whose population grew extraordinarily fast owing to a lack of predators.

The initial premise placed the story on a space station to avoid the ecological damage that the creatures would have on a planet. However, Gerrold&#x27;s agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built as well as the additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent&#x27;s comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold&#x27;s agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season, but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.

At the time that Coon got in touch, Gerrold had just been employed at CBS as a typist working on scripts such as the pilot of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. As soon as he got the response, he quit the job. Gerrold and Coon met once more, and revealed that the network had recently made a request for more episodes based on other planets. Coon told Gerrold to work up a further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons, and moved the action from planetside to a space station. During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day&#x27;s shoot of the episode &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; which was being filmed at the time. This version of the story was entitled &quot;A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...&quot;, which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline. He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not to hand it to another writer for a month. However, Coon made it clear that he was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but was giving him the option of submitting a draft.

Gerrold turned around the first draft script in two and a half days. Both Coon and associate producer Robert Justman gave feedback on the script, and pointed out a few gaps such as there needing to be some way in the plot for the crew to discover that Darvin was a Klingon agent. The following draft had Cyrano Jones discover that Darvin was an agent, which Coon thought was not &quot;punchy&quot; enough. It was then re-written so that the fuzzies were allergic to Klingons. Both Gerrold and Coon thought the idea was &quot;trite... shtick... hokey&quot; and &quot;had been done before&quot;. but Coon agreed that it was the direction the story should go. The re-write of the script took a further week.

On a further visit to the set, Gerrold was called into Coon&#x27;s office. He was informed that he needed to change the name of the fuzzies, as the legal department was concerned about similarities in the name with H. Beam Piper&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot;. He subsequently came up with a variety of alternative names. Through a process of elimination, he ended up with the name &quot;tribble&quot;. Gerrold&#x27;s submitted script was within the standard page count for an episode, but, when it was retyped for distribution by the production&#x27;s mimeo department, it ballooned from 60 to 80 pages due to Gerrold&#x27;s having used a typewriter with 12-pitch rather than the 10 characters per inch Pica standard of the TV and film industry. This meant that some twenty pages needed to be cut from the script.

Scenes which were cut from the script included the &quot;Enterprise&quot; chasing after Jones in his vessel, and resulted in the scene where Kirk has tribbles tumbling onto him while in the grain locker. Gerrold felt that this enforced editing process &quot;tightened up the story and made for a better series of gags&quot;. Nichelle Nichols said to Gerrold &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a script go through so many changes – and stay so much the same&quot;.

Coon&#x27;s participation in terms of suggestions and edits was such that Gerrold thought he should have been given a co-writing credit.

The producers liked the resulting script so much that Gerrold was later tasked with re-writing the script for &quot;I, Mudd&quot;.

During script development the Kellam de Forest Research firm cautioned that the tribbles and the events involving them strongly resembled the Martian flat cats in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;The Rolling Stones,&quot; and suggested that the rights to the novel should be purchased. Gerrold became concerned that he had inadvertently plagiarized the novel which he had read fifteen years before. Coon phoned Heinlein, who, according to Gerrold, only asked for a signed copy of the script and later sent a note to Gerrold after the show aired to thank him for the script.

Heinlein’s own recollections were at odds with this account. In his authorized biography Heinlein said he was called by Gene Coon who gave him a &quot;sob story&quot; about the issue and asked him to waive claim to the &quot;similarity&quot; to his flat cats. Heinlein states he agreed because he’d just been through one costly plagiarism lawsuit against Roger Corman and did not wish to embroil himself in another &quot;chump&#x27;s game&quot;. He had misgivings upon seeing the actual script but let it go, an action he later regretted: &quot;If that matter had simply been dropped after that one episode was filmed, I would have chalked it up wryly to experience. But the &#x27;nice kid&#x27; did not drop it; &#x27;tribbles&#x27; (i.e. my &#x27;flat cats&#x27;) have been exploited endlessly… Well that’s one that did &#x27;larn me.&#x27; Today if J. Christ phoned me on some matter of business, I would simply tell him: &#x27;See my agent.

The fictional quadrotriticale&#x27;s real-world antecedent, the grain triticale, was a fairly new invention at the time of the episode.

===Filming===
The use of live animals to represent the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold&#x27;s account, as their similarity to Heinlein&#x27;s flat cats was not yet discovered, the inspiration for the form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman&#x27;s Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumeré. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie&#x27;s auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode as part of a larger &quot;Star Trek&quot; sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.

Filming began during the second week of August 1967. Three temporary sets and a portion of corridor were constructed for specific use in this episode, which included the large trading post set. The chairs in that set were a problem, as the set designers wanted 24 matching chairs and decided that folding ones would not do. John M. Dwyer sourced them from a local company, but the numbers required meant that they had to be pulled out of showrooms from all over the county. When it came to the fight scene in the episode, Dwyer warned director Joseph Pevney not to damage the chairs. That scene was filmed twice after a cameraman with a handheld camera wandered onto the set. The scene where Kirk is covered with tribbles in the grain container needed to be filmed eight times, using all five hundred sewn tribbles. Gerrold had expected that scene to be cut at some point during production, as he thought that William Shatner would not agree to it. He said that Shatner was the &quot;consummate professional and I believe he was eager to show off his comic abilities&quot;. The scene was later described as &quot;solidifying &#x27;The Trouble with Tribbles&#x27; in the pop culture lexicon&quot;.

Pevney was pleased with the outcome of the shoot, calling the episode &quot;a delightful show from beginning to end&quot;. In addition to directing, Pevney also sourced some of the parts to create the tribbles and was directly responsible for the casting of Stanley Adams. He had pushed for the episode to be made as he recalled that there was some resistance at the time against making a comedy-style episode. These types of episodes were unusual for the series, as only &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; and &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; were considered to be comedic episodes from season two. Pevney was one of the two most prolific &quot;Original Series&quot; directors alongside Marc Daniels, and directed fourteen episodes of the show. The cast responded favorably to the script. Nichelle Nichols was particularly pleased as it allowed Uhura to be a woman and took her off the bridge. It was one of her largest roles in any single episode in the series.

The special effects design for the K-7 Space Station in the episode was based on actual 1959 design by Douglas Aircraft Corporation for the space station.

===Casting===
William Campbell had previously appeared in the first season episode &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot; as Trelane. In &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, he portrayed the Klingon Captain Koloth. At various points &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry claimed it was his intention to bring back Koloth during the third season of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, as Kirk&#x27;s recurring Klingon adversary. Some internal production documents contradict this story. Although Koloth returned in &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, Campbell did not voice the role. He returned to the role in 1994 for an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, entitled &quot;Blood Oath&quot;.

At the time of casting, William Schallert had just finished filming the ABC sitcom &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;. He described himself not as a fan, and had not read any science fiction since 1948. He thought that the role of Nilz Baris was just another guest spot, and considered Baris to be just &quot;a rather stuffy bureaucrat, not the most appealing character&quot;. He did not remember the character&#x27;s name, only learning it when he first attended a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention at a hotel near Los Angeles Airport, as the fans called it out when he entered the lobby. He was later cast in the role of the Bajoran musician Varani in the &quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

Whit Bissell, who played the station manager, Lurry, was better known at the time in the main cast role of Lt. Gen. Heywood Kirk in the ABC science fiction television series &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;. Michael Pataki, who portrayed the Klingon Korax, went on to play Karnas in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; first season episode &quot;Too Short a Season&quot;. Charlie Brill portrayed the Klingon agent Arne Darvin. Brill had previously been a sketch comedy artist with his wife Mitzi McCall, and had appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; when The Beatles made their first appearance.

==Reception==
While initial fan reaction to the episode was mixed, it was more popular with the general public. Critical response to the episode was positive, and it was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation which instead went to fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. It has since been included in several &quot;best of&quot; episode lists and features, including as part of the Best of DVD collection alongside three other episodes. It has also been released as part of the season two DVD box set.

===Broadcast===
&quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was first broadcast in the United States on December 29, 1967 on NBC. The initial fan reaction was undecided, but the episode connected better with the mass market. This effect was later explained in 2012 when Jordon Hoffman on StarTrek.com described &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; as &quot;quite possibly, the first episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; you ever saw&quot;. It entered popular culture and remained well-known to the public outside of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; community.

===Retrospective critiques===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the scene with Kirk and the tribbles in the grain container as one of the &quot;best-remembered moments&quot; of the series. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; as the sixth best moment in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. IGN ranked it as the fifth best episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, while TechRepublic ranked it as the fourth best. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; included &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; in a list of ten must-see episodes, and &quot;USA Today&quot; listed as one of the three best. In 1998, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was listed as the eighth best cult moment of all time by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. In a list of the top 100 episodes of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was placed sixth by Charlie Jane Anders at io9.

Zack Handlen&#x27;s July 2009 review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a grade of A. Cyrano Jones was Handlen&#x27;s least favorite part of the episode, and with the exception of that character, it was one of the better scripts seen in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot all comes together neatly and praised the story&#x27;s effects on Kirk, saying &quot;The way the episode unfolds means Kirk&#x27;s constantly dealing with things he does not really want to deal with, and there&#x27;s a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him complain about it to Spock.&quot;

Michele Erica Green, writing for TrekNation in March 2006, said she thought that the episode would have been dated, but found it was &quot;as funny as ever.&quot; She thought that Scotty&#x27;s lines were &quot;unforgettable&quot; and the scenes between McCoy and Spock were &quot;priceless&quot;. Eugene Myers and Torie Atkinson reviewed the episode for Tor.com in April 2010. They described it as &quot;easily the most celebrated episode of the entire &quot;Original Series&quot; (if not the whole franchise)&quot;. They went on to describe it as a &quot;perfect episode&quot;, and both gave it maximum scores of six out of six.

In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; rated &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; as one of the top ten moments of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, including television series and films up to that time. In 2017, Space.com ranked &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; the second best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; television, including all &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series episodes prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

== Awards ==
The episode was nominated for Best Dramatic Presentation at the 1968 Hugo Awards. All of the nominees that year were episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, with the award instead going to &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. From the number of votes, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was placed second.

==Home media release==
&quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was one of the first episodes to receive an official release by Paramount Home Entertainment. In 1980, it was released on VHS on a two-episode tape alongside &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot;. It was re-released in 1991 as part of the first full-season release on VHS. This was re-released in 1993, and was released on LaserDisc. In 1998, a &quot;Talking Tribble Gift Set&quot; was released which contained both &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; and &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; on VHS. The first DVD release was in 2000, when all of &quot;The Original Series&quot; episodes were released in individual releases of two episodes per disc. The first season set that the episode was included in was a part of the season two DVD set released in the United States on November 2, 2004.

The re-mastered DVD sets were also re-launched to coincide with the release of the film, &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The Blu-ray release included the un-changed scenes as alternative angles. Disc four of each set contained only &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; from &quot;The Original Series&quot; but otherwise contained tribble related extras. These included both &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot; and &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;.

==Legacy==
===&quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;===
&quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was originally intended to have a follow-up episode during season three, but after Gene Roddenberry stepped back from the production of the show after a time-slot change and further cuts in the budget, the idea was scrapped. In 1973, Gerrold had become friends with D. C. Fontana from their time spent on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention circuit together. He had heard about &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, and offered to do an episode. Fontana responded that she wanted the tribble episode that was cut from season three. This episode was entitled &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;. The episode introduces the natural predator of the tribbles and genetically engineered tribbles which no longer reproduce but instead grow much larger. As with his other &quot;Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Bem&quot;, he later explained that almost nothing was cut from the original pitches for the third season of &quot;The Original Series&quot; as animation played out quicker and so everything still fit into the episode despite the reduced running time. Both of Gerrold&#x27;s &quot;Animated Series&quot; episodes were novelized by Alan Dean Foster, and Gerrold later said that he thought that he did &quot;a fine job&quot;.

===&quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;===
To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1996, producers of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; decided to incorporate elements of &quot;The Original Series&quot; into episodes. The &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; homage, entitled &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, sent its characters back in time to the events of &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, digitally inserting the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; actors into footage from nineteen scenes in &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; and other episodes. Charlie Brill also returned to the role of Arne Darvin to film new scenes set in the &quot;DS9&quot; timeframe. The episode was nominated for three Emmy Awards and, like the original episode, the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

As the 30th anniversary approached, Gerrold had heard rumors of a tribble sequel in the works but had only heard denials from executive producer Rick Berman. Following an interview request from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he telephoned Berman once more to ask what was happening as he did not want to say he did not know about the sequel episode and embarrass anyone if it actually was going to happen. Gerrold suggested that an acknowledgement of the creator of the tribbles might be in order and asked if he could be an extra. He appears in the episode as an &quot;Enterprise&quot; officer. While Gerrold was on set, he also advised director Jonathan West on the integration of new scenes into &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. Gerrold later said that &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; &quot;turned out beautiful. I think it was the best episode of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; ever and possibly the best episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; after the Original Series.&quot;

===Further appearances and parodies===
Tribbles have been further seen in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes and films, including &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and the J. J. Abrams-helmed films &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009) and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013). While on a visit to the set of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Gerrold was told by Abrams that the tribble had been deliberately &quot;snuck in&quot; to the scene. It appears in the scene where Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) meet Scott (Simon Pegg) on the Vulcan moon. &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; was also re-imagined in that timeline&#x27;s comic book series by IDW Publishing and entitled &quot;The Truth About Tribbles&quot;.

In 2003, tribbles appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;The Breach&quot;. In that episode, Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley) uses them as food for his medicinal pets in sickbay.

Gerrold has been in discussions with the fan-created series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; to bring back the tribbles for a further &quot;Original Series&quot; era episode. Both his &quot;Original Series&quot; pitch &quot;The Protracted Man&quot; and his &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; script &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; have been turned into episodes of &quot;New Voyages&quot;.

Tribbles have been parodied in a variety of other television shows and types of media. An episode of &quot;Partridge Family 2200 A.D.&quot;, &quot;The Roobits&quot; features fuzzy alien creatures that multiply quickly. This was also done in The Smurfs Season 1 episode &quot;Fuzzle Trouble.&quot; &quot;Futurama&quot; featured a parody in the second season entitled &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot;, which included several &quot;Star Trek&quot; jokes. These include a reference to &quot;Roddenberries&quot; and features Zapp Brannigan, whom the &quot;Futurama&quot; staff have said is intended to be a parody of Captain Kirk. In 2000, a &quot;Drosophila&quot; (fruit fly) gene that blocks cell division was named &quot;tribbles&quot; () after the small, woolly, tribble-like cells with mutations in this gene. A review describing the discovery was named after this episode. Humans carry three homologs of &quot;tribbles&quot;, TRIB1, TRIB2, and TRIB3. The parasprites in the &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; episode &quot;Swarm of the Century&quot; were also partially inspired by the tribbles.

In the 2003 video game &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, the player&#x27;s ship becomes infested with a froglike species called Gizka, prompting the player to receive the quest &quot;The Trouble with Gizka&quot; in order to remove the pests.

Circa early 2013, an internet meme parody started circulating, featuring a still from &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, with the face of Paul McCartney superimposed onto the body of Captain who is surrounded by tribbles, accompanied by the quip &quot;Yesterday: All my tribbles seemed so far away&quot;, parodying the first line of McCartney&#x27;s signature Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Yesterday&quot;. In 2013, singer Bob Robertson expanded the meme into a full parody of the song&#x27;s lyrics, stating that he first saw the original meme in a posting by George Takei.

===Merchandising and adaptations===
Gerrold published a book describing his experiences in the creation of &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. Entitled &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles: The Birth, Sale and Final Production of One Episode&quot;, it was published in 1973. The book was well-received by the former cast and crew of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and was used as a textbook for teaching screenwriting. The episode itself was adapted for a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Too Many Tribbles!&quot;, in the Little Golden Books line with its content somewhat softened for its intended reading demographic.

A variety of tribble replicas have been made over the years, with the most recent licensed product coming from QMx, released in 2013. A plate to commemorate the episode was the first to be launched as part of an eight-plate &quot;Star Trek: The Commemorative Collection&quot; in 1986. It featured an image of Kirk with the tribbles in the grain compartment created by artist Susie Morton. The first &quot;Original Series&quot; expansion for the Star Trek Customizable Card Game was launched in 2000. It was entitled &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; and was based on this episode and the associated episode of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. It also introduced the &quot;Tribbles&quot; game which used only tribble-related cards.

In 2010, two movie posters for &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; featuring Uhura and Spock being slowly covered in tribbles were created by Justin Ishmael for the art boutique attached to the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas. It was a follow-up to earlier posters created for the episode &quot;Space Seed&quot;. Juan Ortiz later created a 1960s-retro style poster for each of the eighty episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The &quot;Trouble with Tribbles&quot; poster made it appear that the warp nacelles of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; were sprouting tribbles which then bred rapidly as the ship flew on, creating a cloud of them behind the ship.

<text>Aarhus University (, abbreviated AU) is a public research university. Its main campus is located in Aarhus, Denmark. It is the second largest and second oldest university in Denmark. The university is part of the Coimbra Group, the Guild, and Utrecht Network of European universities and is a member of the European University Association.

The university was founded in 1928 in Aarhus, Denmark. It comprises five faculties, Arts, Natural Sciences, Technical Sciences, Health, and Business and Social Sciences, and a total of twenty-seven departments. It is home to over thirty internationally recognised research centres, including fifteen centres of excellence funded by the Danish National Research Foundation.

The university&#x27;s alumni include Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of programming language C++; Queen Margrethe II of Denmark; King Frederik X of Denmark; and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former prime minister of Denmark and secretary general of NATO.

Nobel Laureate Jens Christian Skou (Chemistry, 1997) conducted his groundbreaking work on the Na/K-ATPase in Aarhus and remained employed at the university until his retirement. Two other Nobel laureates, namely Trygve Haavelmo (Economics, 1989) and Dale T. Mortensen (Economics, 2010), were affiliated with the university.

==History==

===Early developments===

Aarhus University was founded on 11 September 1928 as &quot;Universitetsundervisningen i Jylland&quot; (&quot;University Studies in Jutland&quot;) with a budget of 33,000 DKK and an enrollment of 64 students, which rose to 78 during the first semester. The university was founded as a response to the increasing number of students at the University of Copenhagen after World War I. Classrooms were rented from the Technical College and the teaching corps consisted of one professor of philosophy and four associate professors of Danish, English, German and French. Along with the &quot;Universitets-Samvirket&quot; (&quot;University Association&quot;) which consisted of representatives of Aarhus&#x27; businesses, organisations and institutions, the municipality of Aarhus had fought since 1921 to have Denmark&#x27;s next university located in the city.

In 1929, the municipality of Aarhus gave the university land with a landscape of rolling hills. The design of the university buildings and 12 ha campus area was assigned to architects C. F. Møller, Kay Fisker and Povl Stegmann, who won the architectural competition in 1931. Construction of the first buildings began a year later, but the campus was developed in stages and is still under development . Since 1939, C. F. Møller Architects has been responsible for the architectural design of Aarhus University in accordance with the original functionalist design key, perhaps best exemplified by the characteristic yellow brick and tile.

The first buildings were finished in 1933 and housed the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Anatomy. These departments later moved to newer buildings at the campus and the original building complex now house Department of Psychology and Department of Political Science. The construction of the first stage was funded solely by donations which totaled 935,000 Dkr and the buildings covered an area of 4,190m2. One of the most generous contributors to the first stage was &quot;De Forenede Teglværker i Aarhus&quot; (&quot;The United Tileworks of Aarhus&quot;) led by director K. Nymark. &quot;Forenede Teglværker&quot; decided to donate 1 million yellow bricks and tiles worth c. 50,000 Dkr and later decided to extend the donation to all bricks needed. The inauguration on 11 September 1933, marked the first official use of the name Aarhus University and was celebrated in a tent on campus, attended by King Christian X, Queen Alexandrine, their son Crown Prince Frederik and Prime Minister Stauning together with 1000 invited guests. On 23 April 1934, Aarhus University was given permission to hold examinations by the king and on 10 October 1935, Professor Dr. phil. Ernst Frandsen was appointed the first rector of the university.

Shortages of materials and a stressed economy postponed and delayed further development of Aarhus University. In 1941, construction of the Main Building (&quot;Hovedbygningen&quot;) commenced, a complex to house the university aula (assembly hall) and canteen among academic and administrative purposes. The stringent minimalist and uncompromising functionalistic design of the first university buildings from 1933 had stirred some local dissatisfaction and it was decided that the Main Building should possess more traditional romantic and classical architectural inspirations - although in agreement with the original architectural plan - and also make use of more lavish and expensive materials. The Main Building was finished in 1946 and still stands out from the rest of the university campus as somewhat different in its architectural design.

In comparison with the original 4,190m2 floor space of the first buildings, Aarhus University now holds a floor space of 246,000m2 in the University Park alone. A series of buildings outside the main campus adds an additional floor space of 59,000m2.

===Faculties===

From 1928, Aarhus University offered courses in languages and philosophy, but the students were unable to finish their studies without going to the University of Copenhagen for their final examinations. By request of the Ministry of Education, the Teachers&#x27; Association made a draft of how to conduct the final examinations in the humanistic subjects in Aarhus and in the draft, the association proposed that the faculty was named the Faculty of Humanities by analogy with the corresponding faculties in Uppsala, Lund and Turku. After negotiations between the faculties in Aarhus and Copenhagen, the king declared on 8 May 1935 that the final university examinations could be held at the Faculty of Philosophy in Copenhagen as well as at the Faculty of Humanities in Aarhus. This was the first final examinations Aarhus University was allowed to hold, but on 24 July 1936 the king granted the Faculty of Humanities the right to hold examinations for the magister degree and in 1940 for the PhD.

Aarhus University had offered courses in basic medical subjects from 1933 and on 10 October 1935 the Faculty of Medicine was formally established. The establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in Aarhus was met with some opposition from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Copenhagen. The professors thought that the state should not establish a new faculty until the shortcomings of the old one had been solved. In the end, the professors agreed to sign a recommendation for the new faculty as long as improvements to the old one were not delayed. By 1953, the Faculty of Medicine had been fully built, complete with lectures, professorship chairs, final exams, research facilities and the hospitals of Aarhus had been expanded to meet the demands of clinical training. In 1992, the Faculty of Medicine merged with the dental school and changed its name to Faculty of Health Sciences. In 1998, the new faculty emphasized clinical training for students of the third semester who have frequented one year of anatomy and cell biology, and introduced a new not assessed curriculum of pre-clinical skills laboratory (two hours per week for nine weeks) followed by two weeks of social medicine and an eight-week clinical clerkship at county hospitals.
The university established its Faculty of Economics and Law in 1936, but when it offered courses in political science and in psychology (1959 and 1968, respectively), the faculty changed its name to the Faculty of Social Sciences. The faculty had to be funded solely on private donations and once the university demonstrated it had the needed financial means, the Minister of Education recommended the Finance Committee to approve the establishment of the faculty on 27 January 1936 since the state did not have to grant financial support. The Committee approved and by declaration of the king on 5 November 1937, the faculty could hold examinations in economics and law.

Courses had been offered in theology since 1932 at the Faculty of Humanities, but in 1942 the Faculty of Theology was formally established. Already on 22 June 1928, Reverend Balslev of Aarhus had proposed that Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus (not yet university) taught basic courses in theology. Though the proposal was greeted by the management, the Faculty of Theology in Copenhagen pointed out that it would take three full-time teachers of the New Testament, Old Testament and ecclesiastical history, respectively as well as education in Latin, Greek and Hebrew by the Faculty of Humanities. At this time, Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus did not have the financial means to meet these criteria so the case was shelved for the time being. In April 1931, the case reopened, this time by Bishop Skat Hoffmeyer who proposed free teaching in the required subjects. The management asked the faculty in Copenhagen if this was acceptable, but because the teaching was free, the faculty saw it as tutoring rather than actual teaching and they neither approved or disproved of such an approach though they did not see it as actual university teaching. The municipality of Aarhus did not aid with funds and the management deemed a request of the state to be futile so they decided to disregard getting the teaching approved and start it anyway under the supervision of Skat Hoffmeyer. On 5 September 1932 the Reverend Asmund held the first lecture in theology. This private education in theology continued until the university could hire its own professors in 1938, and in 1942 Aarhus University could at long last establish the Faculty of Theology. The Aarhus New University Hospital shares Masonic architectural elements related to its history of seat of the Danish Order of Freemasons.

===Main Building and World War II===

In 1938, the university management acknowledged it was time to consider an expansion due to lack of space and overcrowding of the auditoriums. The solution was the Main Building (&quot;Hovedbygningen&quot;), containing both rooms and facilities for new academic areas, as well as housing for the general administration, an assembly hall and a canteen. The building was to be organized according to a principle of institutes so that teaching and research took place in certain rooms with their own library and study for the professor.

The construction of the building took place during the German occupation of Denmark (1940–45) in World War II, which affected the process in more than one way. No state funds had been involved in the construction of the first university building and a second building for physiology, biochemistry, and a high voltage laboratory, but because the Nazis were against civil use of materials and work forces, the state contributed to the main building. In 1943, the Gestapo, Sicherheitsdienst, Geheime Feldpolizei and Abwehr set up their regional headquarters in the five student halls of residence on campus. Fearing that the same would happen to the new main building, its completion was delayed. C. F. Møller later wrote that for once there was plenty of time to work on the details of the building, like patterned brickwork, acoustic screens and furniture. Furniture designer Aage Windeleff, designed the furniture specially for the main building, while Børge Mogensen&#x27;s industrially produced furniture designs are the most commonly used elsewhere on campus.

The presence of the Gestapo in Aarhus led to multiple arrests of Danish resistance fighters and the resistance movement soon realized they needed outside assistance. On 15 October, the leader of the illegal Danish underground army in Jutland, Niels Bennike, sent the following telegram to London:

On 31 October 1944, the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo&#x27;s headquarters in residence halls 4 and 5, also killing ten civilian workers. 2 Group Bomber Command carried out the bombing by using 25 Mosquito planes. The air strike on the University of Aarhus took place in a heavily populated area and the campus was surrounded by three hospitals. To avoid civilian casualties, the RAF prepared with a model of the campus, shooting at residence halls 4 and 5 with chalk bags. The architect C. F. Møller was in the main building during the air strike but survived and was later dug free from the rubble. The reconstructed main building opened on 11 September 1946.

===Since 1970===
Aarhus University was an independent institution until 1970, but with management representatives from the city council and the organization of Universitets-Samvirket. Hereafter, the university became a state-run institution under the first University Act. With the next University Act in 1992, external organizations were once again represented in the administration and under the 2003 Act, all Danish universities are governed by a nationwide university board. This board appoints the rector, deans and heads of departments instead of the students. It commenced in January 2004 for the first time and in August 2005, a new rector was appointed.

In 1994, the university was a scene of a shooting; three people (including the perpetrator) were killed and two more were injured.

Aarhus University has hosted significant musical events. The Grateful Dead played there on April 16, 1972; the recorded performance was part of the group&#x27;s Europe &#x27;72 tour.

In the current century, several higher education institutions have been merged with Aarhus University. Following the Danish University reform of 2006, AU merged with the Business and Engineering School in Herning (now part of faculty of Business and Social Science) and the Danish School of Education in Copenhagen (now part of Faculty of Arts), making the university nationwide and adding 6,000 students. In 2007, the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), until then part of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, and the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DJF), until then part of the Ministry of Agriculture, were merged into AU. The two institutions initially formed separate faculties, which later merged with the Faculty of Science to form the Faculty of Science and Technology.
In 2012, Aarhus University&#x27;s School of Engineering was merged with the university proper, making it Denmark&#x27;s largest.

A major reorganisation of the university effective 1 Jan 2011 reorganised departments into four faculties: Arts, Science and Technology, Health, and Business and Social Sciences. A further reorganisation occurred effective 1 Jan 2020, where Science and Technology was split into two new entities: Faculty of Technical Sciences and Faculty of Natural Sciences.

==Campus==

Aarhus University&#x27;s main campus is located in central Aarhus, encircling the University Park (&quot;Universitetsparken&quot;).

The campus master plan competition was won in 1931 by the collaborative scheme of Danish architects Kay Fisker, C. F. Møller and Povl Stegmann in collaboration with landscape architect Carl Theodor Sørensen. The design includes a wide variety of buildings in a large area, but each building is constructed of the same yellow brick and roofing tile and with a common design key, providing the whole campus with a unified appearance. Construction commenced in 1932 and has continued into present times, lately in 1999-2001 (&quot;Søauditorierne&quot;) and 2014-17 (AU Health). The original main building was one of the first Danish functionalist public buildings and has been included in the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s canon of Danish architecture; it is acknowledged as one of the twelve most significant architectural works in the cultural history of Denmark. In a harmonic interplay with the park, the yellow buildings form a campus that has received international recognition for its aesthetic values and it has been protected by law since 1993, in order to conserve its unique design. C. F. Møller and his company, C. F. Møller Architects have continued as architects of the campus ever since, except the new department of AU Health currently under construction, designed by Cubo. The park and campus has been expanded throughout the years, in 1957 the old park of Vennelystparken, just south of the university park was included.

Apart from the main campus, Aarhus University has several smaller campuses and departments throughout Aarhus. This includes the campus on Fuglsangs Alle in Aarhus V, hosting a large part of Aarhus BSS, and campus Nobelparken, adjacent to the university park and built in 1997–2004 in red brick, also by C. F. Møller Architects, but in a different design, parts of the research park IT-byen at Katrinebjerg, where the Department of Computer Science also teach and do research, and more recently (still under construction), the buildings of the former municipal hospital across the street from the university park. Archaeology and anthropology takes residence in Moesgård Manor, an old manor house at the new Moesgård Museum.

Aarhus University also has locations outside of Aarhus. In the city of Herning, there is a small campus where a few of the university&#x27;s business, engineering and technology programmes are taught, called the Department of Business Development and Technology. In Copenhagen, part of the Danish School of Education is located at Campus Emdrup.

===Dormitories===

A large part of the dormitories, e.g. Børglum Kollegiet, and youth accommodation in Aarhus is administered by the non-profit housing cooperative of Kollegiekontoret or though the public web-platform Ungdomsboliger.dk providing access to student and youth accommodation all across Denmark. Only the (full name: ) dormitories are located on campus and run by Aarhus University; other dormitories are located elsewhere, all across the city. It is also the only dormitory exclusively for students at Aarhus University.

==Organisation and administration==
The university is governed by the university board which has 11 members: six members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, two members are appointed by the academic staff, one member is appointed by the technical/administrative staff, and two members are appointed by the university students. As required by Danish law, the rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence Danish universities has no faculty governance.

===Main academic areas===
Since 1 January 2020, the university has been organised into five main academic areas:
*&quot;Technical Sciences&quot; – consists of the subjects of environmental sciences, agricultural science, and engineering from the former Faculty of Science and Technology.
*&quot;Natural Sciences&quot; – consists of the remaining departments which were part of the former Faculty of Science and Technology.
*&quot;Arts&quot; – consists of the former Faculty of Humanities and the former Faculty of Theology.
*&quot;Aarhus BSS&quot; – consists of the former Faculty of Social Sciences and the Aarhus School of Business.
*&quot;Health&quot; – consists of the former Faculty of Health Sciences.

==Academics==

, more than 32,000 students were enrolled in Aarhus University. Each year more than 1000 international exchange students come to Aarhus University to study for one or two terms. In 2009 close to 3000 international students were enrolled in full degree programmes. Aarhus University is an international university with a large proportion of students at the post-baccalaureate level: over half of its students are enrolled in master&#x27;s degree and PhD programmes. In 2011, 59 of the university&#x27;s 113 Master&#x27;s degree programmes were taught in English. Talent development of young researchers has been identified as one of the university&#x27;s core activities. This means that highly qualified students have the option of starting their PhD studies before completing their master&#x27;s degree. The university&#x27;s doctoral programmes allow talented students to enroll in a combined Master&#x27;s/PhD programme either right after completing the master&#x27;s degree (the 5+3 track) or one year into their master&#x27;s degree programme (the 4+4 track). Since 2006 the number of PhD students has risen from approximately 1000 to approximately 1700 in 2010.

===International Centre===
The International Centre maintains international partnerships and combines a wide range of services for exchange students, international full-degree students, PhDs and visiting scholars. The International Centre is often the first stop for foreign students at Aarhus University, since the centre offers advice on finding housing and living in Denmark.

===AU Summer University===
Starting in 2011 all summer courses and summer schools offered by Aarhus University for bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD students will be gathered together and expanded to provide more diversity in a new framework: AU Summer University. In the summer of 2011 more than 80 courses were offered within the fields of humanities, theology, social sciences, health sciences, natural sciences, agricultural sciences, business and educational sciences. Summer courses are open to both Danish and international students.

===Cheminova controversy and academic freedom at AU===
Since 1944, Aarhus University owned Cheminova, a chemical manufacturer which, among other controversies, has been selling methyl parathion pesticide to Brazil farmers. In 2009, senior researcher Mette Jensen emailed her colleagues at AU, asking whether they thought Cheminova should stop selling the controversial pesticides. For this, the university threatened her with dismissal. The university&#x27;s Pro-Vice-Chancellor Søren E. Frandsen denied that the university had made any mistakes or threatened the freedom of speech and academic freedom of its staff.

On 30 April 2015, Cheminova was sold to the FMC Corporation for DKK 8.5 billion, a controversial issue in itself.

==Major research centres==
Aarhus University is home to 15 Centres of Excellence supported by the Danish National Research Foundation and a considerable number of major research centres.

Hence, the programme encompasses physics, chemistry, biology, molecular biology, mathematics and computer science.

===Danish Centre for Environment and Energy (DCE)===
In 2011 the National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark (NERI) was organisatorically moved from the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy and merged into AU, under the new name Danish Centre for Environment and Energy (DCE). DCE consists of two departments: department of Bioscience and Department of Environmental Sciences, as well as a common secretariat, all under the Faculty of Technical Sciences. The core obligations of DCE continues to be to provide research based monitoring and advice to the Danish Government on environmental issues and conduct independent research and education within the same fields.

===Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture (DCA)===
Also in 2011 the Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture was merged into AU. First as a separate faculty for Agricultural Research, later as part of the Faculty of Technical Sciences. The former departments are now organised as Departments of Agroecology, Animal Sciences, and Food Science, together with a common secretariat: Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture (DCA). The core obligations of DCA is to provide advice and supporting research to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, while the departments also engage in independent research and teaching. The Global Rust Reference Center provides testing and investigation services of new and difficult cases of wheat stem rust/black stem rust.

==Student life==

Students from different fields meet in the numerous Friday bars and at various events organized by student organizations. The Friday bars are often organised by students from the different departments who set up a small, local bar in a canteen or classroom where beers and non-alcoholic drinks are served. The university also offers the Student bar (&quot;Studenterbaren&quot;) though Studenterhus Aarhus.

The university also has a number of libraries, some of which are open around the clock with student or employee cards.

<text>The Trappists, officially known as the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance (, abbreviated as OCSO) and originally named the Order of Reformed Cistercians of Our Lady of La Trappe, are a Catholic religious order of cloistered monastics that branched off from the Cistercians. They follow the Rule of Saint Benedict and have communities of both monks and nuns that are known as Trappists and Trappistines, respectively. They are named after La Trappe Abbey, the monastery from which the movement and religious order originated. The movement began with the reforms that Abbot Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé introduced in 1664, later leading to the creation of Trappist congregations, and eventually the formal constitution as a separate religious order in 1892.

== History ==
The order takes its name from La Trappe Abbey or &quot;La Grande Trappe&quot;, located in the French province of Normandy, where the reform movement began. Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé, originally the commendatory abbot of La Trappe, led the reform. As commendatory abbot, de Rancé was a secular individual who obtained income from the monastery but was not a professed monk and otherwise had no monastic obligations. The second son of Denis Bouthillier, a Councillor of State, he possessed considerable wealth and was earmarked for an ecclesiastical career as coadjutor bishop to the Archbishop of Tours. However, after undergoing a conversion of life between 1660 and 1662, de Rancé renounced his possessions, formally joined the abbey, and became its regular abbot in 1663.In 1664, in reaction to the relaxation of practices in many Cistercian monasteries, de Rancé introduced an austere reform. De Rancé&#x27;s reform was first and foremost centered on penitence; it prescribed hard manual labour, silence, a meagre diet, isolation from the world, and renunciation of most studies. The hard labour was in part a penitential exercise, in part a way of keeping the monastery self-supportive so that communication with the world might be kept at a minimum. This movement spread to many other Cistercian monasteries, which took up de Rancé&#x27;s reforms. In time, these monasteries also spread and created new foundations of their own. These monasteries called themselves &quot;Trappist&quot; in reference to La Trappe, the source and origin of their reforms.

In 1792, during the French Revolution, La Trappe Abbey, like all other monasteries at the time, was confiscated by the French government and the Trappists expelled. Augustin de Lestrange, a monk of La Trappe at that time, led a number of monks to establish a new monastery in the ruined and unroofed former Carthusian charterhouse of Val-Sainte in the Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland, where the monks subsequently carried out an even more austere reform practising the ancient observances of Benedict of Nursia and the first usages of Cîteaux. In 1794, Pope Pius VI raised Val-Sainte to the status of an abbey and motherhouse of the Trappists, and Dom Augustin was elected the first abbot of the abbey and the leader of the Trappist congregation. However, in 1798, when the French invaded Switzerland, the monks were again exiled and had to roam different countries seeking to establish a new home, until Dom Augustin and his monks of Val-Sainte were finally able to re-establish a community in La Trappe.

In 1834, the Holy See formed all French monasteries into the Congregation of the Cistercian Monks of Notre-Dame de la Trappe, with the abbot of La Trappe being the vicar general of the congregation. However, there were differences in observances between the dependencies of Val-Sainte and those of Notre-Dame de l&#x27;Eternité, an abbey itself founded by Val-Sainte in 1795. This led to two different Trappist congregations being formed by decree of the Holy See in 1847. These were named the &#x27;Ancient Reform of Our Lady of La Trappe&#x27; and the &#x27;New Reform of Our Lady of La Trappe&#x27;, the former following the Constitutions of de Rancé, with the latter following the Rule of Saint Benedict combined with the ancient constitution of Cîteaux, except in a few areas prescribed by the Holy See in the same decree.

In 1892, seeking unity among the different Trappist observances, the Trappist congregations left the Cistercian Order entirely and merged to form a new order with the approval of Pope Leo XIII named the &#x27;Order of Reformed Cistercians of Our Lady of La Trappe&#x27;, formalising their identity and spirituality as a separate monastic community.

In 1909, the Trappists of Mariannhill were separated from the rest of the Trappist Order by decree of the Holy See to form the Congregation of Mariannhill Missionaries.

A well-known Trappist theologian was Thomas Merton, a prominent author in the mystic tradition and a noted poet and social and literary critic. He entered the Abbey of Gethsemani in 1941 where his writings and letters to world leaders became some of the most widely read spiritual and social works of the 20th century. Merton&#x27;s widely read works include his autobiography, &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot;, as well as &quot;New Seeds of Contemplation&quot; and &quot;No Man is an Island&quot;.

The first Trappist saint was Rafael Arnáiz Barón, who was a conventual oblate of the Abbey of San Isidro de Dueñas in Dueñas, Palencia. His defining characteristic was his intense devotion to a religious life and personal piety despite the setbacks of his affliction with diabetes mellitus. He died in 1938, aged 27 from complications of diabetes, was beatified in 1992 by Pope John Paul II and canonized in 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI.

== Monastic life ==

Trappists, like the Benedictines and Cistercians from whom they originate, follow the Rule of Saint Benedict. &quot;Strict Observance&quot; refers to the Trappists&#x27; goal of following the Rule closely. They take the three vows described in the Rule (c. 58): stability, fidelity to monastic life, and obedience.

Benedict&#x27;s precept to minimize conversation means that Trappists generally speak only when necessary; thus idle talk is strongly discouraged. However, contrary to popular belief, they do not take a vow of silence. According to Benedict, speech disturbs a disciple&#x27;s quietude and receptivity, and may tempt one to exercise one&#x27;s own will instead of the will of God. Speech that leads to unkind amusement or laughter is considered evil and is forbidden. A Trappist sign language, one of several monastic sign languages, was developed to render speaking unnecessary. Meals are usually taken in contemplative silence as Trappists listen to a reading.

Unlike the Benedictines and Cistercians, Trappists fully abstain from &quot;flesh meats&quot; (pig, cattle, sheep, venison, etc), described by Saint Benedict as &quot;four-footed animals&quot;. However, they generally do not live as strict vegetarians, as they consume poultry, fish and seafood, though their diet mostly consists of vegetables, beans, and grain products. Some monasteries also raise broiler chickens.

=== Daily life===

The Liturgy of the Hours is the foundation of every Trappist&#x27;s life. However, the details of daily life can vary from community to community and based on the liturgical calendar. The following schedule is a representative summary of a Trappist&#x27;s daily life.

*3:30 AM | Rise
*4:00 AM | Vigils followed by Meditation, Lectio Divina or private prayer
*5:30 AM | Breakfast available
*6:30 AM | Lauds
*7:30 AM | Eucharist (Mass) (10:00 AM on Sundays)
*8:00 AM | Great Silence Ends
*8:30 AM | Terce
*9:00 AM | Morning work period begins
*12:00 PM | Sext
*12:15 PM | Dinner
*12:45 PM | Rest
*1:30 PM | None
*1:45 PM | Afternoon work period begins
*5:00 PM | Supper
*6:00 PM | Vespers
*7:30 PM | Compline
*8:00 PM | Grand Silence Begins &amp; Retire


=== Becoming a Trappist ===
Though each monastery is autonomous and may have different rules, generally the stages to enter the Trappist life can be described as follows:
* Candidate/observership: candidates or observers visit a monastery and consult the vocation director and/or the superior to help them discern their vocation. Usually they will be asked to live in the monastery for a short period of time, at least one month.
* Postulancy: candidates live as a member of the monastery as a postulant for some months and are guided by the novice director.
* Novitiate: postulants will be clothed with the monastic habit and are formally received as a member of this order. Novices are still guided by the novice director, and they undergo this stage for two years.
* After novitiate, novices may take temporary vows. They will live this stage for three to nine years to deepen study, practicing the Gospel in the monastic way and integration within the society.
* After finishing the previous stage, the professed members may take final vows for their entire life.

=== Manual labor ===
The 48th chapter of the Rule of St. Benedict states &quot;for then are they monks in truth, if they live by the work of their hands&quot;. Thus, the life of a Trappist monk is centered on manual labor in addition to their spiritual activities. In addition to the tangible results of manual labor, which goes to support the economy of the community and the poor, the monk&#x27;s work also contributes and reinforces the monk&#x27;s and community&#x27;s spiritual growth.

The goods produced range from cheeses, bread and other foodstuffs to clothing and coffins. Their most famous products are Trappist beers. These are a unique category within the beer world, and are lauded for their high quality and flavor. These monasteries brew beer both for the monks themselves and for sale to the general public. Trappist beers contain residual sugars and living yeast and are felt to improve with age, unlike conventional beers.

The Trappist monks of the Tre Fontane Abbey raise the lambs whose wool is used to make the pallia of new metropolitan archbishops. The pope blesses the pallia on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul; the metropolitan archbishops receive those pallia in a separate ceremony within their home dioceses from the hands of the apostolic nuncio, who personally represents the pope in their respective countries.

The monks of New Melleray Abbey in rural Peosta, Iowa produce caskets for both themselves and sale to the public.

Cistercian College, Roscrea, a boys&#x27; boarding secondary school in Ireland, is the only Trappist school left in the world, and one of only two remaining monastic secondary schools in Ireland.

== Organization ==

Cistercian monasteries have continued to spread, with many founded outside Europe in the 20th century. In particular, the number of Trappist monasteries throughout the world has more than doubled over the past 60 years: from 82 in 1940 to 127 in 1970, and 169 at the beginning of the 21st century. In 1940, there were six Trappist monasteries in Asia and the Pacific, only one Trappist monastery in Africa, and none in Latin America. Now there are 13 in Central and South America, 17 in Africa, and 23 in Asia and the Pacific. In general, these communities are growing faster than those in other parts of the world.

Over the same period, the total number of monks and nuns in the Order decreased by about 15%. There are on average 25 members per community – less than half those in former times. , there were 1,796 Trappist monks and 1,592 Trappistine nuns across the world.

=== Institutional Structure ===
Cistercian communities are autonomous but united in a communion implemented by key institutions:

* Regular Visitation: An independent &quot;Father Immediate&quot; is appointed to help and support the abbot in the exercise of his pastoral charge and to foster concord in the community. The Father Immediate or other representative visits the monastery approximately every two years. The purpose of this “Regular Visitation” is to strengthen and supplement the pastoral action of the local superior, to correct violations where necessary, and to renew the nuns’ or monks’ spiritual fervor.
* General Chapter: The General Chapter is the supreme authority of the order. Since 2011, Abbots and Abbesses form a single General Chapter. They meet every 3 years for three weeks to strengthen the bonds of the order and to make key decisions, including the election of the Abbot General when necessary. The Abbot General chairs the General Chapter.

=== Abbots General ===

The Abbot General is elected for an unrestricted amount of time by the General Chapter. He is assisted by a Council that is composed of five members, four of them are elected by the General Chapter and the fifth is chosen by the elected Council members. The Abbot General and his Council reside in Rome and are generally in charge of the order&#x27;s affairs. The present Abbot General is Dom Bernardus Peeters of Koningshoeven Abbey in the Netherlands.

<doc id="401288" wikidata="Q974344" url="?curid=401288" title="William Joppy">
<text>William Torelle Joppy (born September 11, 1970) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2011, and held the WBA middleweight title three times between 1996 and 2003.

==Professional career==
Turning pro in 1993, Joppy built up a record of 21–0–1 (17 KO) before getting his first shot a world title.

===WBA middleweight champion===

Joppy won his first of two WBA middleweight titles in June 1996 by stopping defending champion Shinji Takehara in Japan with a flurry of punches in the ninth round. He then would make a couple defenses of his crown. However, on August 23, 1997, Joppy lost a decision to Julio César Green. Joppy&#x27;s very next fight, on January 31 of the next year, saw him avenge that loss with a decision win by a wide margin. This fight won Joppy the WBA title for the second time. After recovering from a neck injury, Joppy stopped Green on cuts in the seventh round in a rubber match (Green had been the interim champion while Joppy recovered), and made a few more defenses, including a 3rd-round TKO of a 47-year-old Roberto Durán.

===Losing his title against Trinidad===

Joppy lost the title a second time, however, on May 12, 2001, to Félix Trinidad in the middleweight unification tournament. Joppy was knocked down in rounds one and four before finally being stopped in the fifth. He would credit Trinidad&#x27;s power after the fight saying &quot;I&#x27;ve never been hit like that before.&quot;

===Post title===

After Bernard Hopkins beat Trinidad, Joppy had the chance to fight for the new WBA (Regular) belt. He claimed the title from British contender Howard Eastman in a close majority decision where he was knocked down by Eastman in the final few seconds.

On December 14, 2003, Joppy was stripped of his title following a challenge to undisputed champion Bernard Hopkins, losing by a wide points margin on all three judges&#x27; cards. A year later, Joppy lost another lopsided unanimous decision against Jermain Taylor.

Joppy returned as a Super Middleweight on July 29, 2005 knocking out journeyman Rashaan Blackburn in the third round. Joppy said then that he hoped to have one final title run as a Super Middleweight before retirement. After a string of five victories against lesser opponents, Joppy obtained a title fight against the new IBF champion Lucian Bute on February 29, 2008. Bute won by way of technical knockout in round 10 and Joppy retired after the bout, only to come back two years later.

===Retirement===
Following a close decision loss to Sebastien Demers in March 2010 Joppy announced his retirement from boxing, although it was not the first time that Joppy has announced that he is leaving the sport. He returned to the ring later that year, fighting Baltimore native Cory Cummings to a draw, and subsequently defeated Cummings by unanimous decision in a 2011 rematch.

<doc id="401291" wikidata="Q3239271" url="?curid=401291" title="Encounter at Farpoint">
<text>&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; is the pilot episode and series premiere of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which premiered in syndication on September 28, 1987. It was written by D. C. Fontana and Gene Roddenberry and directed by Corey Allen. Roddenberry was the creator of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and Fontana was a writer on the original series. It was originally aired as a two-hour (with commercials) TV movie, and subsequent reruns typically split the episode into two parts.

Set in the 24th century (2360s to 2370s), the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. In this episode, the crew of the newly built &quot;Enterprise&quot; examine the mysterious Farpoint Station which the Bandi people are offering to the Federation, while under the scrutiny of a powerful godlike entity that calls itself &quot;Q&quot; (John de Lancie).

The episode was made as a pilot for the new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and was a double length episode at Paramount Television Group&#x27;s insistence. After the show was initially announced on October 10, 1986, Roddenberry put together a production team which included staff members from the original series such as Robert H. Justman. The show used some existing sets and props from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films and both &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;. New actors were hired for the pilot, which in some cases required the character concepts to be redeveloped to better fit the actor. Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby were hired for the roles of Macha Hernandez and Deanna Troi respectively, but were later switched by Roddenberry and Crosby&#x27;s new role renamed to Tasha Yar.

DeForest Kelley agreed to appear in a cameo role in the pilot, but—as a gesture to Roddenberry—refused to be paid more than the minimum possible salary. The show made its debut in syndication to a mixed critical response, an assessment which was upheld by critics reassessing the episode following the end of the entire series. It also marked the first appearance of the emergency saucer separation maneuver and the only time where the saucer reconnection sequence appears on-screen.

==Plot==
In 2364, the new flagship of the United Federation of Planets, Starfleet&#x27;s , travels to the planet Deneb IV for its maiden voyage. &quot;Enterprise&quot; is to open relations with the simple Bandi people, who have somehow been able to tap immense energy reserves and construct Farpoint Station, much to the surprise of the Federation. En route, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is met by an omnipotent being who identifies himself as Q, a member of the Q Continuum who declares that humanity is being put on trial for savagery, and decides that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew&#x27;s actions in their upcoming mission will be used to judge humanity&#x27;s worth and determine their fate as a race. Before letting the ship resume its course, Q warns Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) that he is destined to fail.

As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives, the crew members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and establish relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit, begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship&#x27;s phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears to remind him of humanity&#x27;s trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft.

The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and they are able to free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.

Though Q goads Picard into punishing the Bandi, Picard refuses, instead ordering the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to fire a vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint after the station is evacuated. The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies into orbit to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells Picard that the humans have succeeded in their test, but hints that they will meet again.

==Production==

===Conception and development history===
The new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series was announced on October 10, 1986, by the head of Paramount Television Group, Mel Harris. He announced that the creator of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Gene Roddenberry, was to be executive producer and lead the creation of the new series. It was the second attempt at creating a new live-action television series based on &quot;Star Trek&quot; for Paramount; production on the previous attempt in 1977, called &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, became &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. When the decision was made not to proceed with the Paramount network it had been slated to be the flagship for, and interest in a new movie was piqued after the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Paramount had pitched ideas to Roddenberry earlier in 1986 as it was the twentieth anniversary of the original series, but Roddenberry turned them down and initially didn&#x27;t want to do a new series. He later said, &quot;It was only when the Paramount people agreed with me and said a sequel was probably impossible anyway that my interest was piqued.&quot;

All four major networks turned down the new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot as well as a promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.

Fontana, who had previously worked on a number of episodes of the original series, was tasked with writing the script for the pilot. The production team met in full for the first time on February 18, 1987, having received the first draft of Fontana&#x27;s script a few days earlier. The original premise involved the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the USS &quot;Starseeker&quot; approaching an alien lifeform captured by a race called the Annoi and turned into a weapon. After the Annoi told the Starfleet ships to surrender, the &quot;Starseeker&quot; opened fire and was destroyed, while Troi contacted the alien and convinced it to crash on a nearby planet so that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; can help it to free itself along with rescuing other prisoners the Annoi were using as slaves on the surface. Despite numerous changes taking place to the plot before the final version, some of the introductions for various characters made it through to the final version. The plot involving Q was added subsequently to the episode in order to make it longer. Roddenberry was aiming for an hour-long pilot, but Paramount wanted a two-hour show and eventually won out. Other items were also added in order to lengthen the episode, including the saucer separation sequence and the appearance of Admiral Leonard McCoy.

===Casting===
Roddenberry realized early on that a series with the original crew from &quot;Star Trek&quot; was unlikely to be practical, nor did he want to recast the roles or have a &quot;retread&quot; crew – a series of different characters in very similar roles to the original series. He explained, &quot;I would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren&#x27;t other possibilities to think about.&quot; The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; &quot;Julien Picard&quot; would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein&#x27;s role in &quot;Aliens&quot;, while Deanna Troi was to appear &quot;foreign&quot; or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought that there would be a greater number of storylines available if the character was male.

Patrick Stewart was cast in the role of Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman arranged a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Rick Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn&#x27;t find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked &quot;awful&quot;. Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, &quot;The great strength of &quot;Star Trek&quot; is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television.&quot;

Roddenberry&#x27;s favorite for Riker was Jonathan Frakes, who went through seven auditions before claiming the role. Despite being the second choice of the casting team, he was hired after their first choice was unimpressive in his auditions.

LeVar Burton had worked with Justman on another pilot for a series called &quot;Emergency Room&quot; and was suggested to apply for the role of La Forge. For US audiences, he was the most well-known actor in the cast, due to his role in &quot;Roots&quot;.

Gates McFadden and Brent Spiner gained the parts of Beverly Crusher and Data respectively through the normal audition processes. Eric Menyuk had also been considered for the part of Data, and would later be cast as the recurring character of the Traveller in three subsequent episodes. Justman later said that he was the only one out of the production team who preferred Menyuk in the role.

Marina Sirtis auditioned for the role of Macha Hernandez, while Denise Crosby auditioned for the part of Deanna Troi. They both gained the parts with the approval of Berman and Justman, but Roddenberry switched the roles of the actresses as he thought Sirtis would be better suited for the role of the ship&#x27;s counselor. Macha Hernandez was re-written to become Tasha Yar to better suit Crosby.

The role of Worf required a black actor in order to make the Klingon make up easier to apply, and was expected to be only a recurring character, but following the casting of Michael Dorn and his work in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, the role was expanded.

Wil Wheaton was cast as Wesley Crusher despite what he perceived as an &quot;awful&quot; first callback. J. D. Roth was also considered for the role.

The appearance of DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy was kept a secret, with the character only being referred to in scripts as &quot;Admiral&quot;. While Roddenberry had wanted Kelley to appear, he thought that the actor would turn him down. The two had lunch together and Roddenberry suggested the appearance, with Kelley agreeing not only to appear, but also that he would not take anything more than the Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild base salary for the part. He later said, &quot;I just wanted scale, to let it be my way of saying thank you to Gene for the many good things he has done for me&quot;.

John de Lancie deliberately missed his first audition for Q as he was appearing as a lead in a play at the time. A second audition was arranged during lunchtime so that he could attend. He later said that after he auditioned, &quot;a big guy walked out, put his hands on my shoulder, and said, &#x27;You make my words sound better than they are.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Well, you must be the writer.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m Gene Roddenberry.&#x27; I had absolutely no idea who that was.&quot;

Colm Meaney was cast in the part of the conn ensign on the ship&#x27;s battle bridge, and after a further appearance in the episode &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot;, his character was given the name Miles O&#x27;Brien in season two.

The cast was announced on May 15, 1987. There was a certain degree of uncertainty regarding job security during the pilot for the main cast, as they did not hear until after production had wrapped that the show had been picked up for a further thirteen episodes.

===Filming===
Due to what was seen as a low budget for the pilot and series in general, the existing sets and equipment from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies were re-used in the new show. Milkis and Justman were given the task of reviewing the standing sets from the movies on the Paramount lot in order to see what they could use. The duo would later recall that one stage was so completely covered with cat feces due to the number of cats living on the lot that the pair couldn&#x27;t walk on the set. Certain sets were re-used, including a re-dress of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge from &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; to act as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; battle bridge in the new series. The main engineering set from &quot;Star Trek III&quot; became the new main engineering set, albeit with a command console from &quot;Star Trek IV&quot; added as well as two walls from sickbay from &quot;Star Trek III&quot;. The rest of the sickbay set became the observation lounge during the first season. Some of the sets contained components from both &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; and the unfilmed &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;.

After running tests with a company for computer-generated special effects, it was decided that, for the sake of reliability, Industrial Light &amp; Magic would produce the new models of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, at a cost of $75,000 for a and a version. ILM was also integral to the development of the &quot;jump to warp&quot; special effect, which resulted in the company remaining on the show&#x27;s end credits through its entire run. Filming of &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; began on the Paramount lot May 29, 1987, and wrapped on June 25. Wil Wheaton noted that during the filming of &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, most of the cast believed that the series would not last more than a year.

==Reception==
The show was broadcast on both 98 independent stations and 112 network affiliates. In several locations, including Dallas, Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami, the stations which were broadcasting &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; gained higher ratings than the four major networks during prime time. Overall, it aired to an audience of 27 million. The show was immediately called the &quot;highest-rated syndicated one-hour drama series on television&quot;.

Jill L. Lanford watched the episode for &quot;The Herald Journal&quot;, prior to the series premiere. She thought it was a resurrection of a &quot;legend&quot;. She believed the episode itself was reminiscent of classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes &quot;Arena&quot; and &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;, was the &quot;perfect vehicle to introduce the crew&quot;, and a &quot;perfect start&quot;. Don Merrill, writing for &quot;TV Guide&quot; said that the show was a &quot;worthy successor to the original&quot;. Bob Niedt reviewed &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; for &quot;Newhouse News&quot; and thought that the show had potential on the back of the episode, but there were problems such as &quot;spots where the dialogue is pedestrian and interactions sputter&quot;. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; viewed DeForest Kelley&#x27;s cameo as &quot;touching&quot;, but thought that Patrick Stewart was a &quot;grim bald crank who would make a better villain&quot;. He felt Jonathan Frakes &quot;verges on namby-pamby&quot;. Actress Marina Sirtis later recalled the reviews of the show&#x27;s debut in 1987 while being interviewed to promote &quot;The Next Generation&quot;&#x27;s fourth film, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, saying &quot;they bloody hated us&quot;.

Several reviewers reassessed the episode some time after the series aired. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for &quot;TrekNation&quot;, and found the episode disappointing with reference to the character of Captain Picard and the female crew members and a lack of sense of fun. Actor Wil Wheaton, also reviewing the episode years later for &quot;TV Squad&quot;, gave the episode a &#x27;C−&#x27; grade, suggesting that &quot;at the time, Trekkies who were hoping to see the Star Trek that they were used to from the sixties must have been disappointed&quot;. Zack Handlen at &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, criticized some of the elements of the episode, such as the &quot;long, rather pointless sequence&quot; where the &quot;Enterprise&quot; undergoes a saucer separation and overall described the episode &quot;more functional than inspiring&quot;. He praised the performance of Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard, describing him as a &quot;damn fine actor&quot; and enjoyed John de Lancie as Q. He gave the episode an overall score of B−. James Hunt, from &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, re-reviewed the show following the re-release of season one on Blu-ray Disc. He stated, &quot;even if it wasn&#x27;t the first episode, it&#x27;d be worth watching&quot; despite it coming from &quot;what could arguably be called the worst season of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that the pace of the episode was slow, but that both Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner stood out from the rest of the cast for good reasons. He enjoyed the references to the original series, especially DeForest Kelley&#x27;s appearance. He gave it overall a score of four out of ten. The episode was one of a handful of &quot;Star Trek&quot; programs recommended for viewing to introduce new viewers to the mythos in Jon Wagnar and Jan Lundeen&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos&quot;.

The episode has been rated one of the series&#x27; best by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, and one of the most important Picard-focused episodes by &quot;SciFiPulse.net&quot; and Tom&#x27;s Guide.

The episode was nominated for a Hugo award.

In 2021, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Guide&quot; said that the character Q&#x27;s appearance in this episode helped TNG &quot;work&quot;, with his debut bringing an energy to the episode, a character that was enigmatic, playful, and possessing a &quot;rapier wit&quot;.

==Home media release==
&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; made its debut on VHS in September 1991 with &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; as a feature-length episode on a single tape. It was subsequently released on DVD on region one on March 26, 2002. The sound was remastered to Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround standards, and a series of interviews with the cast and crew were included on the sixth disc.

It was released in VHS in the United Kingdom.

===LaserDisc===
This episode was released in the &quot;Q Continuum&quot; collection of LaserDisc. The collection was released on July 30, 1997 and was published by Paramount Home Video; it retailed for 100 USD. The set included the 2-part &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, &quot;Hide &amp; Q&quot;, &quot;Q Who?&quot;, and &quot;Deja Q&quot; on 12 inch optical discs in NTSC format with a total runtime of 230 minutes. The collection came in a Tri-Fold jacket that also included a letter from actor Jon De Lancie.

&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; was released in Japan on LaserDisc on June 10, 1995, as part of &quot;First Season Part.1&quot;. This included first season episodes up to &quot;Datalore&quot; with a total runtime of 638 minutes on 12-inch optical video discs.

&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; was released on PAL-format LaserDisc in the United Kingdom as part of &quot;The Pilots&quot; collection, in April 1996&quot;.&quot; This included the color version of &quot;The Cage&quot;, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, &quot;Emissary&quot;, and &quot;Caretaker&quot; with a total runtime of 379 minutes.

===Blu-ray===
&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; was one of the first episodes of the series to be released on Blu-ray Disc. The episode was remastered into high-definition video and involved the original production team in updating some of the special effects in the episode. It was featured on the single disc sampler of the series which was launched prior to any full season box sets in early 2012, entitled &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation – The Next Level&quot; along with two other episodes. &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; was subsequently included in the Blu-ray Disc release of the season one box set.

== Broadcast and streaming ==
&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; first aired as a single two-hour-long movie (including commercials) in broadcast syndication starting the week of September 28, 1987. The production code for the 2 hour movie is 721, whereas it was also presented as two television episodes with production numbers 101 and 102.

On the launch of Paramount+ streaming service, on March 4, 2021, a free &quot;Star Trek&quot; marathon was presented, featuring the pilots of the various &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, including &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. The marathon started at 7 am PT/10 am ET and was livestreamed on the YouTube internet video platform on that day.

==Novel==
A novelization of this episode was published by Pocket Books, it was one of five novelizations to be made of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episodes, alongside &quot;Unification&quot;, &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Relics&quot;, and &quot;All Good Things...&quot;. The novelization was credited to original Star Trek series writer David Gerrold, but according to Gerrold the manuscript was actually written by D.C. Fontana, who had the assignment taken away by Roddenberry following a dispute over writing credits for the original teleplay. Gerrold submitted Fontana&#x27;s manuscript under his own name with Fontana&#x27;s blessing (without informing Roddenberry or Paramount) and voluntarily gave all proceeds from its sales to Fontana. Gerrold himself was denied co-creator credit for the series despite having written the original writers&#x27; &quot;Bible,&quot; and was given the novelization as a financial apology.

&quot;The Q Continuum&quot; trilogy of novels, featuring the character Q, was conceived by John J. Ordover at Pocket Books and written by Greg Cox. The author only accepted the project after rewatching all the television episodes featuring Q.

<doc id="401302" wikidata="Q1848668" url="?curid=401302" title="Honours of Scotland">
<text>The Honours of Scotland (, ), informally known as the Scottish Crown Jewels, are the regalia that were worn by Scottish monarchs at their coronation. Kept in the Crown Room in Edinburgh Castle, they date from the 15th and 16th centuries, and are the oldest surviving set of crown jewels in the British Isles.

The Honours were used together for the coronation of Scottish monarchs from Mary, Queen of Scots in 1543 until Charles II in 1651. From the Union of the Crowns in 1603 until the Union of 1707, the Honours were present at sittings of the Parliament of Scotland to signify the presence of the monarch and their acceptance of the power of Parliament. From at least the 16th century the monarch (or the Lord High Commissioner) signified the granting of Royal Assent by their touching the final printed copy of an Act of Parliament with the Sceptre during a meeting of the Parliament. 

Following the Union of 1707, the Honours were locked away in a chest in Edinburgh Castle and the Crown Jewels of England continued to be used by British monarchs as the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. The Honours were rediscovered in 1818 and have been on public display at Edinburgh Castle ever since. The Honours have been used at state occasions including the visit of George IV in 1822, Elizabeth II&#x27;s first visit to Scotland as monarch in 1953, and a national service of thanksgiving for Charles III following his coronation in 2023. The Crown of Scotland is present at each Opening Ceremony of the Scottish Parliament.

The Honours of Scotland consist of the Crown of Scotland, the Sceptre, and the Sword of State. The gold crown was made in Scotland and, in its present form, dates from 1540. The sword and sceptre were made in Italy as gifts to James IV from the pope. The Honours also appear on the crest of the Royal Coat of Arms of Scotland and on the Scottish version of the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom, where the red lion of the King of Scots is depicted wearing the crown and holding the sword and sceptre. Coronation robes, a pair of spurs, a ring and consort crowns were also part of the Scottish regalia, none of which survives today. The gold ampulla of Charles I that held anointing oil at his 1633 coronation now belongs to the National Museum of Scotland.

The Crown Room in Edinburgh Castle also contains the Elizabeth Sword, a silver-gilt wand, the 17th-century Stewart Jewels (which were added in 1830), and the Lorne Jewels, which were bequeathed to Scotland by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, in 1939.

==History==
===Early history===

In the earliest known depiction of a Scottish king wearing his symbols of sovereignty, King Edgar (reigned 1097–1107) wears a crown and bears a sword and a sceptre on his Great Seal. His brother, Alexander I, is shown holding an orb – a pictorial emblem of divine kingship that was not actually part of the Scottish regalia. By the reign of John Balliol, the regalia consisted of a crown, sceptre, sword and ring. After the English invasion in 1296, these regalia and Stone of Scone, upon which monarchs of Scotland were invested and crowned, were captured by the English army and taken south to London.

New regalia were made in the 14th century for subsequent coronations, and though the Crown of Scotland may in its previous form date from this period, the other regalia were gradually replaced by the 16th century with the current set of Honours – consisting of the Crown of Scotland remodelled in 1540, and the Sceptre and Sword of State which were both made in Italy and given to James IV as papal gifts. A consort crown was made in 1539 for Mary of Guise, wife of James V, but it does not survive among the Honours.

The Honours in their present form were first used together at the coronation of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1543. By the second half of the 16th century, they represented royal authority in the Scottish Parliament, and Acts of Parliament were given royal assent when the monarch (or their representatives) touched them with the Sceptre. The Honours were usually kept in Edinburgh Castle, where they remained during the Marian Civil War. Mungo Brady made substitutes for a Parliament at Stirling in 1571. The Honours were found in a chest in a vault or &quot;cave&quot; when Edinburgh Castle surrendered in May 1573. Henry Echlin of Pittadro negotiated the delivery of the Honours to Regent Morton. Morton brought the Honours to Stirling Castle for his Parliament on 15 July 1578, where they were held by the Earls of Angus, Lennox, and Mar.

===17th and 18th centuries===

From the Union of the Crowns in 1603 until the Union of 1707, the Honours were taken to sittings of the Parliament of Scotland to signify the monarch&#x27;s presence and their acceptance of the power of the Parliament. Spurs – emblems of knighthood and chivalry – were presented to Charles I at his Scottish coronation in 1633; the spurs and coronation robes also have been lost. The Honours were last used at a coronation in 1651, when Charles II was crowned at Scone. As Oliver Cromwell had invaded Scotland the previous year, and Edinburgh Castle had surrendered to his army that December, the Honours could not be returned there. The English Crown Jewels had already been melted down and struck into coins by the Commonwealth. With Cromwell&#x27;s army fast advancing on Scone, in June 1651 the Privy Council decided to place them at Dunnottar Castle in Kincardineshire, the family seat of the Earl Marischal, the custodian of the Honours.

They were brought to Dunnottar, hidden in sacks of wool, and Sir George Ogilvie of Barras, lieutenant-governor of the castle, was given responsibility for its defence. In November 1651, Cromwell&#x27;s troops called on Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the subsequent blockade of the castle, the removal of the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. Two stories exist regarding the removal of the Honours. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and scabbard hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher&#x27;s servant and carried off in a creel of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.

At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Honours were removed from Kinneff Old Kirk and returned to Edinburgh Castle. During the debates in the Scottish Parliament from October 1706 to January 1707 on the Treaty of Union, rumour spread that the Honours were to be taken to England and melted down (an obscene song from the post-union period suggested that they were to be melted down to be turned into a set of dildos for Queen Anne). To allay fears over the fate of the Honours, on 14 January 1707 the Parliament amended Article 24 of the Treaty with a clause stating that &quot;... the crown, scepter and sword of state... continue to be keeped as they are in that part of the united kingdome now called Scotland, and that they shall so remain in all tyme coming, notwithstanding of the union.&quot; With the adjournment of Parliament on 25 March 1707, the Honours no longer had any practical use. They were taken to the Crown Room in Edinburgh Castle, where they were safely locked away in a great oak chest, and the doorway of the Crown Room was walled up.

===19th century===

On 28 October 1817, the Prince Regent issued a royal warrant authorising specified commissioners to break open the walled-up doorway of the Crown Room. The commissioners were: Lord Granton (the Lord President of the Court of Session), Lord Boyle (the Lord Justice Clerk), William Adam (the Lord Chief Commissioner of the Jury Court), Major-General Sir John Hope (the Commander-in-Chief, Scotland), Kincaid Mackenzie (the Lord Provost of Edinburgh), James Wedderburn (Solicitor General), the novelist and historian Walter Scott (in his capacity as Clerk of Session), William Clerk (clerk of the Jury Court), Henry Jardine (Deputy Remembrancer in Exchequer), and Thomas Thomson (Deputy Lord Clerk Register). The commissioners broke into the Crown Room on 4 February 1818. Half expecting to find the oak chest empty, they were relieved to open it and discover the crown, sceptre and sword, wrapped in linen, exactly as they had been left 111 years earlier. The Royal Standard was hoisted above Edinburgh Castle in celebration of the historic moment. Cheers of excitement rippled through the castle, and members of the public gathered outside to hear the news. On 26 May 1819, the Honours went on public display in the Crown Room. They were guarded by two veterans of the Battle of Waterloo dressed in a Jacobean-style Yeoman&#x27;s outfit.

George IV was crowned king in 1821 and his visit to Scotland the following year was the first by a monarch since 1651. On 12 August 1822, the Honours were escorted in procession to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. There was a carnival atmosphere, with people lining the streets and observing from windows. Three days later, the king arrived at the palace and symbolically touched the regalia. Before leaving the country a week later, he took part in a return procession to the Castle, where the Honours would remain until the 20th century.

===20th century and later===
In 1911 the sword was carried before George V at the official opening of the Thistle Chapel in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh – the first time any of the regalia had left Edinburgh Castle since 1822. During the Second World War, the Honours were hidden at the Castle owing to fears they might be lost if the UK fell to Germany. The crown and Stewart Jewels were buried under the floor of a water closet, while the sceptre, sword and wand were hidden inside a wall. The only officials who knew of the hiding places were George VI, the Scottish Secretary of State, the King&#x27;s Remembrancer, and the Governor General of Canada. On 24 June 1953 they were presented to the newly crowned Elizabeth II at a national service of thanksgiving in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral. Keen to avoid the service being interpreted as a Scottish coronation, Sir Winston Churchill, then Prime Minister, advised the Queen to dress with relative informality.

From 1971 until 1987 the sword was used at the installation of Knights of the Order of the Thistle, Scotland&#x27;s highest Order of Chivalry. When the Stone of Scone was returned to Scotland in 1996 it was placed in the Crown Room alongside the Honours. During renovations in the 1990s, the Honours were temporarily stored at an anonymous bank in Edinburgh. The Crown of Scotland was present in May 1999 at the first sitting of the devolved Scottish Parliament. It was carried on a cushion, the official reason being that it was too fragile for the Queen to wear.

In 2018 plans were announced to renovate the &quot;past its sell-by date&quot; Honours exhibition and improve accessibility.

The Crown of Scotland was placed on Elizabeth II&#x27;s coffin at a service in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral on 12 September 2022 and remained there whilst she lay in rest. Her successor Charles III was presented with the Honours on 5 July 2023 at a national service of thanksgiving in the same cathedral.

==Honours==
===Crown===
A crown must have been made during the reign of Robert the Bruce or his son, David II, as David was anointed and crowned, as were all the subsequent Stewart kings, and it was probably this new crown that was remodelled into the current crown. It can be seen in its pre-1540 form in a portrait of James IV in the &quot;Book of Hours&quot; that was created for his marriage to Margaret Tudor in 1503. Arches were added to the crown by Adam Leys for James V in 1532, making it an imperial crown, symbolising the king&#x27;s status as an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God. Arches first appeared as pictorial emblems on coins under James III, who in 1469 claimed &quot;ful jurisdictione and free impire within his realm&quot;.
In 1540, the circlet was melted down and recast by the Edinburgh goldsmith John Mosman, with the addition of 22 gemstones to the original 20 and an extra of Scottish gold. James V first wore it to his wife&#x27;s coronation in the same year at Holyrood Abbey. It weighs , and the circlet is decorated with alternating fleurs-de-lis and crosses fleury. Four gold half-arches, preserved from the original crown, are surmounted by a gold &quot;monde&quot; – enamelled blue with stars representing the night sky. On top of the &quot;monde&quot; is a cross decorated with black enamel, pearls and a large amethyst. Originally, a purple velvet bonnet was manufactured by Thomas Arthur of Edinburgh. This was changed to a red bonnet by James VII, and the present bonnet dates from 1993. Four gold ornaments with a large pearl in the centre are attached to the bonnet between the crown&#x27;s arches.

===Sceptre===

The Sceptre, a symbolic ornamental rod held by the Scottish monarchs at their coronation, was a gift from Pope Alexander VI to James IV in 1494. This papal gift replaced a native-made sceptre which dated from the 14th century at the earliest, and which has been lost. The silver-gilt sceptre was made in Italy, was remodelled and lengthened for James V in 1536 by the Edinburgh goldsmith Adam Leys, and is long. The Sceptre consists of a handle attached to the bottom of a hexagonal rod, which is topped by a finial. The rod is engraved with grotesques, urns, leaves, thistles and fleurs-de-lis. The finial features stylised dolphins (symbols of the Church), and three figures under canopies: the Virgin Mary wearing a crown and holding the infant Jesus in her right arm and an orb in her left hand; Saint James the Great holding a book and a staff; and Saint Andrew holding a book and a saltire. The finial is topped by a globe of polished rock crystal, surmounted with a golden globe topped by a large pearl.

===Sword of State===

The Sword of State was a gift from Pope Julius II presented to James IV along with a blessed hat in 1507 as papal recognition of James&#x27;s defence of Christendom (see blessed sword and hat). The sword, which measures in length, was made by Domenico da Sutri and replaced a native-made Sword of Honour that had been made in 1502 to complement the Sceptre, and which has been lost. The steel blade, measuring in length, is etched on either side with the figures of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and the words: JULIUS II PONT MAX (Julius II Supreme Pontiff) in inlaid gold lettering. 

The silver-gilt handle is decorated with oak leaves and acorns, with two stylised oak leaves which overlap the scabbard, and a crossguard in the form of dolphins. The Sword of State&#x27;s wooden scabbard is bound in crimson velvet with silver-gilt repoussé work and hung from a long sword belt that is made from woven silk and thread-of-gold and has a silver-gilt buckle.

==Other jewels in the Crown Room==

===Elizabeth Sword===

In 2023 the Sword of State was considered too fragile to be presented along with the other Honours of Scotland to King Charles III at the national service of thanksgiving and dedication at St Giles Cathedral on 5 July. A new ceremonial sword, named the Elizabeth Sword after the late monarch, was made by Scottish artisans for the purpose, at a cost of £22,000.

===Wand===
Alongside the crown, sceptre and sword, Walter Scott found a silver-gilt wand. It measures in length and is topped with a faceted crystal monde surmounted by a cross. The wand has a wooden core and the unknown maker&#x27;s initials F.G. The object&#x27;s intended role – if it had one at all – has been forgotten, and its presence among the regalia is still a mystery. Walter Scott thought it may have been carried before the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. Although the Treasurer did have a mace it was a different shape.

===Stewart Jewels===
Four objects taken into exile by James VII after the Glorious Revolution in 1688 are also displayed: a locket, a Great George and collar, and a ruby ring. The Stewart Jewels were passed down in the Stuart family. They all returned to Britain 119 years later and were given to Edinburgh Castle on permanent loan by William IV in 1830.

The St Andrew Jewel of the Order of the Thistle is a gold and silver locket suspended from a ribbon that contains an oval piece of chalcedony into which is carved a cameo figure of Saint Andrew. The cameo is bordered with 12 diamonds. Inscribed on the back is the Order&#x27;s Latin motto: NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSIT (no one attacks me with impunity). Inside is a miniature portrait of Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, wife of Charles Edward Stuart, the grandson of James VII. The object is variously of English, French, Italian and Dutch origin, was altered several times, and measures by .

The Collar and the Great George of the Order of the Garter consist of an enamelled gold figure of Saint George, the patron saint of England, slaying a dragon made for Charles II in 1661 suspended from a gold collar made in 1685. The George is set with 122 diamonds and measures by . The saint&#x27;s cloak and a large suspension loop are both missing. The collar is long and has 26 alternating knots and enamelled badges, each with a tudor rose in the centre.

The Ruby Ring was probably used at the English coronations of Charles I and Charles II, and certainly that of James. It has a large ruby etched with a St George&#x27;s Cross and bordered by 26 diamonds applied in the 19th century.

===Lorne Jewels===
Queen Victoria&#x27;s fourth daughter, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, died in 1939 and bequeathed a necklace, locket, and pendant to the nation of Scotland. The London-made jewellery was a wedding gift to Louise from her husband the Marquess of Lorne (later the Duke of Argyll) in 1871. The necklace contains 190 diamonds connected by 13 pearls enclosed with diamonds; it suspends the locket, consisting of a large pearl surrounded by 30 diamonds; from which hangs the pear-shaped pendant, set with diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, having a relief depiction of the Galley of Lorne and the motto of Dukes of Argyll: NE OBLIVISCARIS, meaning &quot;do not forget&quot;.

==Ampulla of Charles I==
A gold ampulla was crafted to hold the oil with which Charles I was anointed king at his Scottish coronation in 1633. The pear-shaped vessel is tall and weighs . Never used again, it was discovered in the possession of Sir George Grant-Suttie, 7th Baronet, in 1907 by the Scottish Church Society. In 1948 it was acquired by the National Museum of Scotland. The ampulla bears the following Latin inscription to commemorate its use at Charles I&#x27;s coronation:

:&quot;Avrea Sacri olei&quot;
:&quot;Receptaculum quo Carolvs eius nominus primus Scotiae&quot;
:&quot;Anglie Fran; et hib; Rex.&quot;
:&quot;Edinburg; in Ecclesia&quot;
:&quot;S: Crucis unctus fuit&quot;
:&quot;lunii xviii&quot;
:&quot;1633.&quot;

==Commissioners for the Keeping of the Regalia==
Under the terms of a royal warrant of 1818, the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland (the First Minister of Scotland), the Lord Clerk Register, the Lord Advocate, and the Lord Justice Clerk are &quot;ex-officio&quot; Commissioners for the Keeping of the Regalia. Since 1996, the commissioners have also been empowered by another royal warrant for the safekeeping of the Stone of Scone and for the arrangement of its return to Westminster Abbey for the next British coronation.

<doc id="401310" wikidata="Q25366" url="?curid=401310" title="Where No Man Has Gone Before">
<text>&quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; is the third episode of the first season of the American science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Samuel A. Peeples and directed by James Goldstone, it first aired on September 22, 1966.

In the episode, after the attempts to cross the energy barrier at the edge of the galaxy, two crew members develop powerful ESP abilities that threaten the safety of the crew.

The episode was the second pilot, produced in 1965 after the first pilot, &quot;The Cage&quot;, was rejected by NBC. Reportedly, Lucille Ball, who owned Desilu Productions (where the pilot was produced), persuaded NBC management to consider a second pilot, thereby exercising a special option agreement it had with Desilu, because she liked Gene Roddenberry and believed in the project. The episode was eventually broadcast third in sequence, and it was the first episode to be shown in the United Kingdom by the BBC on July 12, 1969.

&quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; was the first produced episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to feature William Shatner as Captain James Kirk, James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, and George Takei as Lt. Sulu (in this episode, the ship&#x27;s astro scientist, whose character became helmsman in subsequent episodes). The episode also features Sally Kellerman as Dr. Elisabeth Dehner, the ship’s psychiatrist. This is the only appearance of that character in the show. The episode title is the final phrase in the opening voice-over, which characterizes the series and has entered popular culture.

==Plot==
The is on an exploratory mission to leave the galaxy. En route, a damaged ship&#x27;s recorder of the SS &quot;Valiant&quot;, an Earth spaceship lost 200 years earlier, is found. Its record is incomplete, but it reveals that the &quot;Valiant&quot; had been swept from its path by a &quot;magnetic space storm,&quot; and that the crew had frantically searched for information about extrasensory perception (ESP) in the ship&#x27;s library computer. The recording ends with the captain of the &quot;Valiant&quot; apparently giving a self-destruct order.

Captain Kirk decides that they need to know what happened to the &quot;Valiant&quot;, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crosses the edge of the galaxy. There, it encounters a strange barrier which damages the ship&#x27;s systems and warp drive, forcing a retreat. At the same time, nine crew members are killed and both helmsman Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and the ship&#x27;s psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman) are knocked unconscious by the barrier&#x27;s effect. When he awakens, Mitchell&#x27;s eyes glow silver, and he begins to display remarkable psychic powers.

Mitchell becomes increasingly arrogant and hostile toward the rest of the crew, declaring that he has become godlike, enforcing his desires with displays of telepathic and telekinetic power.

Science Officer Spock comes to believe that the &quot;Valiant&quot; crew members might have experienced the same phenomenon, and destroyed their ship to keep the power from spreading. He advises Kirk that Mitchell may have to be killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees - although he accepts Spock&#x27;s alternate suggestion to maroon Mitchell at a completely automated lithium-cracking facility on the remote planet of Delta Vega. Once there, the landing party tries to confine Mitchell, but his powers have become too great. He kills navigator Lee Kelso by telekinetically garroting him and escapes by knocking out Kirk and Spock, taking with him Dr. Dehner, who has now developed ESP powers of her own.

Kirk follows and appeals to Dr. Dehner&#x27;s humanity for help. Before Mitchell can kill Kirk, Dehner attacks him using her powers and weakens him. Mitchell fatally injures Dehner, but before he can recover from the effort, Kirk uses a phaser rifle to create a rock slide, killing Mitchell.

Back on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk makes a log entry that both Dehner and Mitchell gave their lives &quot;in performance of duty&quot;. He explains to Spock that he wants his friend&#x27;s service record to end positively: &quot;He didn&#x27;t ask for what happened to him.&quot;

==Production and casting==
The original pilot of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;, was rejected in February 1965 by NBC executives. The show had been sold to them as a &quot;&quot;Wagon Train&quot; to the stars&quot;, and they thought the first pilot did not match the adventure format they had been promised and was &quot;too cerebral&quot; for the general audience. However, NBC, having been persuaded by Desilu management (and reportedly by Lucille Ball herself), maintained sufficient interest in the format to order a second pilot episode in March 1965.

Roddenberry wrote two story outlines, &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; and &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;. He wrote the teleplay for the former and gave the latter to Stephen Kandel. Roddenberry asked long-time associate and veteran scriptwriter Samuel Peeples to submit ideas for another. Peeples came up with the premise and episode title for &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; and was assigned to write it. Roddenberry rewrote Peeples&#x27;s script several times and while he enjoyed working with Roddenberry, after seeing the pilot Peeples preferred his original version of the script. There was some discussion over who came up with the title &quot;Where no man has gone before&quot;; Peeples stated unequivocally that it was his idea, and not Roddenberry&#x27;s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert Franklin Solow 1997 https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671896287/page/64 64&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kandel had fallen ill and his script was not finished in time; the other two were submitted to NBC for consideration. NBC preferred &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; as a pilot. &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; was later made as the second episode in regular production, and &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; was made towards the end of the second season.

Casting took place in June 1965. Jeffrey Hunter was unwilling to reprise his role as Captain Christopher Pike. Lloyd Bridges and Jack Lord were considered, but William Shatner was finally cast as Pike&#x27;s replacement, Captain James Kirk. The character of Number One, the female second-in-command, was dropped on the insistence of the NBC network, and Science Officer Spock was given Number One&#x27;s unemotional demeanor. NBC was worried about Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s &quot;satanic&quot; appearance and pressured for his removal. As Roddenberry later explained at conventions, he felt he had a strong enough negotiating position to save one character, but not both. Roddenberry went on to muse that, had he done it the other way around, he could not have then married the losing actor (Majel Hudec, who changed her surname to Barrett and returned in the role of Christine Chapel). Kirk, who became &quot;James T. Kirk&quot; for the main series, is &quot;James R. Kirk&quot; here, according to the gravestone Mitchell prepares for him on the planet.

Apart from Captain Kirk, the episode introduced two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, a friend of director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as the ship&#x27;s physicist. Sulu would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship&#x27;s doctor is instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix), who lost the role to DeForest Kelley.

Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had starred in the title role of Roddenberry&#x27;s earlier series on NBC, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes and scleral lenses were called for, which were produced by expert contact lens fabricator, John Roberts, who laminated wrinkled tinfoil between layers of the scleral lenses which covered the entire eye. These, outdated by the 1960s, could be painful, perhaps dangerous to the actors&#x27; eyes (modern scleral lenses can &quot;breathe&quot; and are oxygen permeable). Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them difficult to see through. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.

Other cast members included Paul Carr as Navigator Lee Kelso, Lloyd Haynes as Communications Officer Alden and Andrea Dromm as Yeoman Smith (Alden and Smith were intended to be regulars in the show, but were replaced by Uhura and Janice Rand, respectively). The episode also is the first time long-running background actor Eddie Paskey appeared; his character would later be identified as Lt. Leslie.

The costumes from the first pilot were used in &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; with the exception of the insignias in two respects – the outlines were gold in the first pilot but black in the second, and the insignia symbols for engineering and sciences were reversed for the series proper. Completely new uniforms and insignia would be unveiled when the series was green-lighted, with the colors altered and black collars introduced. Most of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets were also reused from &quot;The Cage&quot;, while Sickbay was the only major set constructed for the episode. Like &quot;The Cage&quot;, the episode was shot at Desilu&#x27;s Culver City studios.

The episode was directed by James Goldstone. He was hired primarily to get his opinion on which of the first three scripts should be the second pilot. While his best friend Stephen Kandel wrote &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;, Goldstone agreed &quot;Where no man has gone before&quot; was the right choice. Ernest Haller, who had won the Oscar for Best Color Cinematography on the movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), served as director of photography for the episode. He had been brought in out of semi-retirement at Goldstone&#x27;s recommendation at the last minute, after attempts to locate a cameraman had proved problematic. Robert H. Justman was credited as assistant director.

Shooting started on July 19, 1965, several days later than originally scheduled. During the filming of this episode, a wasp&#x27;s nest high in the rafters of the studio was somehow disturbed, and many cast and crew members suffered stings as a result. As this happened on a Friday, the weekend break allowed time for the swelling to go down; Shatner, however, required additional makeup to hide the stings during shooting the following Monday. Filming finished late on July 28, 1965; the final footage filmed was part of the fight between Kirk and Mitchell. While the schedule allowed seven days to shoot the episode, it required nine, which was Justman&#x27;s original estimate. The episode cost around $300,000, around half the money spent on making &quot;The Cage&quot;.

In a 1988 TV special, &quot;The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next&quot;, series creator Gene Roddenberry said that, as with the first pilot, this one still had a lot of science fiction elements in it, but at least it ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that&#x27;s what sold NBC on &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Original cut==
Post-production on the episode was delayed by Roddenberry&#x27;s involvement in another pilot, &quot;Police Story&quot;. Post-production finished in January 1966 and the episode was presented to NBC for approval (which finally came in February 1966). This original version (production number 02a) differed from the later final broadcast cut (production number 02b, airing on September 22, 1966) in that each of the four acts had on-screen titles (&quot;Act I&quot;, &quot;Act II&quot;, etc.), as well as an epilogue. It also featured a much longer opening narration by Shatner. In some places alternate musical scores were used. In total almost five minutes of footage was removed to accommodate the original series&#x27; 50-minute network broadcast format to allow for commercials. The episode in its original version was seen by the public before the aired version, having been shown at the 24th World Science Fiction Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 3, 1966—shortly before the premiere broadcast of &quot;Star Trek&quot; on NBC.

The studio did not retain a print of this original version, and it was officially thought to be lost. In 2009, a German film collector discovered a print of it and brought it to the attention of CBS/Paramount, which then released it under the title &quot;&quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot; – The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode&quot; as part of the &quot;TOS&quot; season 3 box set on Blu-ray.

== Non-canonical related works ==
The episode was adapted into a short story by James Blish for &quot;Star Trek 8&quot;, published by Bantam in 1972. It also became the second in Bantam&#x27;s series of Fotonovels, published in 1977.

=== Non-canonical books ===
The Galactic Barrier is later associated with the Q in the 1994 novel &quot;Q-Squared&quot; by Peter David and the 1998 Star Trek: The Q Continuum trilogy by Greg Cox.

Gary Mitchell does not appear again in the show. Several books, including Michael Jan Friedman&#x27;s &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, Vonda N. McIntyre&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise: The First Adventure&quot;, and Margaret Wander Bonanno&#x27;s &quot;Strangers from the Sky&quot;, feature the character in adventures set before the events of the episode. The 2005 &quot;Star Trek: Vanguard&quot; book &quot;Harbinger&quot; is set immediately after the events of &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; and features a troubled Kirk musing on his friend&#x27;s death. Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Stargazer&quot; book &quot;The Valiant&quot; features two people who claim to be descended from the &quot;Valiant&quot;″s crew.

=== Non-canonical mini-series ===
Gary Mitchell (portrayed by Daamen J. Krall) appears in the alternate timeline depicted in the 2006-2008 mini-series &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;.

=== 765874 – Unification ===
Gary Lockwood returned to the role of Gary Mitchell in the 2024 short film, &quot;765874 – Unification&quot;, appearing to use his godlike powers to help Kirk reunite with Spock in his dying moments.

==Reception==
In 2013, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine ranked this episode one of the top ten episodes of the original television series. They note famous lines such as Kirk&#x27;s plea for compassion, and the absence of series regulars such as Dr. McCoy, Uhura, and Chekov.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B+&#x27; rating, describing it as &quot;an awkward episode&quot; but that &quot;it&#x27;s not without its charms.&quot;

In 2016, IGN ranked &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; number six in a top ten list of original series episodes. They also ranked it the 17th best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

In 2018, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked this the 4th best episode of the original series.

== Releases ==
&quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; was released on PAL-format LaserDisc in the United Kingdom as part of &quot;The Pilots&quot; collection, in April 1996&quot;.&quot; This included the color version of &quot;The Cage&quot;, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, &quot;Emissary&quot;, and &quot;Caretaker&quot; with a total runtime of 379 minutes.

<text>The Honours of the Principality of Wales are the regalia used at the investiture of the Prince of Wales, as heir apparent to the British throne, made up of a coronet, a ring, a rod, a sword, a girdle and a mantle. All but the coronet date from the investiture of Prince Edward (later Edward VIII then Duke of Windsor) in 1911 when most of the Honours of Wales were redesigned.

The present coronet takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by Charles II in 1677, which states, &quot;The son and heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear his coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and a ball and cross&quot;. Within the frame, which is made of gold, is a velvet cap lined with ermine. The present coronet was made for the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales (later Charles III) in 1969 as the Coronet of George was still in the possession of the Duke of Windsor who was living in exile in France. The defunct coronet and its predecessor the Coronet of Frederick are now a part of the Crown Jewels in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. The original coronets as worn by the Welsh rulers of the Kingdom of Gwynedd and other Welsh principalities have been lost. Llywelyn&#x27;s coronet was seized by the king of England in 1284 and is known only to history. The fates of the coronets of the rulers of the other princely states, if they ever had them, are not known.

The regalia were on display at the National Museum of Wales from 1974 until 2011 when they were put into storage at St James&#x27;s Palace, London. The coronet and rod were both put on permanent display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London in 2020.

<text>The Knudsen number (Kn) is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free path length to a representative physical length scale. This length scale could be, for example, the radius of a body in a fluid. The number is named after Danish physicist Martin Knudsen (1871–1949).

The Knudsen number helps determine whether statistical mechanics or the continuum mechanics formulation of fluid dynamics should be used to model a situation. If the Knudsen number is near or greater than one, the mean free path of a molecule is comparable to a length scale of the problem, and the continuum assumption of fluid mechanics is no longer a good approximation. In such cases, statistical methods should be used.

==Definition==
The Knudsen number is a dimensionless number defined as

:formula_1

where
: formula_2 = mean free path [L1],
: formula_3 = representative physical length scale [L1].

The representative length scale considered, formula_3, may correspond to various physical traits of a system, but most commonly relates to a &quot;gap length&quot; over which thermal transport or mass transport occurs through a gas phase. This is the case in porous and granular materials, where the thermal transport through a gas phase depends highly on its pressure and the consequent mean free path of molecules in this phase. For a Boltzmann gas, the mean free path may be readily calculated, so that

:formula_5

where
: formula_6 is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10−23 J/K in SI units) [M1 L2 T−2 Θ−1],
: formula_7 is the thermodynamic temperature [θ1],
: formula_8 is the particle hard-shell diameter [L1],
: formula_9 is the static pressure [M1 L−1 T−2],
: formula_10 is the specific gas constant [L2 T−2 θ−1] (287.05 J/(kg K) for air),
: formula_11 is the density [M1 L−3].

If the temperature is increased, but the &quot;volume&quot; kept constant, then the Knudsen number (and the mean free path) doesn&#x27;t change (for an ideal gas). In this case, the density stays the same. If the temperature is increased, and the &quot;pressure&quot; kept constant, then the gas expands and therefore its density decreases. In this case, the mean free path increases and so does the Knudsen number. Hence, it may be helpful to keep in mind that the mean free path (and therefore the Knudsen number) is really dependent on the thermodynamic variable density (proportional to the reciprocal of density), and only indirectly on temperature and pressure.

For particle dynamics in the atmosphere, and assuming standard temperature and pressure, i.e. 0 °C and 1 atm, we have formula_2 ≈ (80 nm).

==Relationship to Mach and Reynolds numbers in gases==
The Knudsen number can be related to the Mach number and the Reynolds number.

Using the dynamic viscosity
:formula_13

with the average molecule speed (from Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution)
:formula_14

the mean free path is determined as follows:
:formula_15

Dividing through by &quot;L&quot; (some characteristic length), the Knudsen number is obtained:
:formula_16

where
: formula_17 is the average molecular speed from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution [L1 T−1],
: &quot;T&quot; is the thermodynamic temperature [θ1],
: &quot;μ&quot; is the dynamic viscosity [M1 L−1 T−1],
: &quot;m&quot; is the molecular mass [M1],
: &quot;kB&quot; is the Boltzmann constant [M1 L2 T−2 θ−1],
: formula_11 is the density [M1 L−3].

The dimensionless Mach number can be written as
:formula_19

where the speed of sound is given by
:formula_20

where
: &quot;U∞&quot; is the freestream speed [L1 T−1],
: &quot;R&quot; is the Universal gas constant (in SI, 8.314 47215 J K−1 mol−1) [M1 L2 T−2 θ−1 mol−1],
: &quot;M&quot; is the molar mass [M1 mol−1],
: formula_21 is the ratio of specific heats [1].

The dimensionless Reynolds number can be written as
:formula_22

Dividing the Mach number by the Reynolds number:

:formula_23

and by multiplying by formula_24 yields the Knudsen number:

:formula_25

The Mach, Reynolds and Knudsen numbers are therefore related by

:formula_26

==Application==

The Knudsen number can be used to determine the rarefaction of a flow:

* formula_27: Continuum flow
* formula_28: Slip flow
* formula_29: Transitional flow
* formula_30: Free molecular flow
This regime classification is empirical and problem dependent but has proven useful to adequately model flows.
Problems with high Knudsen numbers include the calculation of the motion of a dust particle through the lower atmosphere and the motion of a satellite through the exosphere. One of the most widely used applications for the Knudsen number is in microfluidics and MEMS device design where flows range from continuum to free-molecular. In recent years, it has been applied in other disciplines such as transport in porous media, e.g., petroleum reservoirs. Movements of fluids in situations with a high Knudsen number are said to exhibit Knudsen flow, also called free molecular flow.

Airflow around an aircraft such as an airliner has a low Knudsen number, making it firmly in the realm of continuum mechanics. Using the Knudsen number an adjustment for Stokes&#x27; law can be used in the Cunningham correction factor, this is a drag force correction due to slip in small particles (i.e. &quot;d&quot;&quot;p&quot; &lt; 5 μm). The flow of water through a nozzle will usually be a situation with a low Knudsen number.

Mixtures of gases with different molecular masses can be partly separated by sending the mixture through small holes of a thin wall because the numbers of molecules that pass through a hole is proportional to the pressure of the gas and inversely proportional to its molecular mass. The technique has been used to separate isotopic mixtures, such as uranium, using porous membranes, It has also been successfully demonstrated for use in hydrogen production from water.

The Knudsen number also plays an important role in thermal conduction in gases. For insulation materials, for example, where gases are contained under low pressure, the Knudsen number should be as high as possible to ensure low thermal conductivity.

<text>Chinkultic, sometimes &quot;Chincultic&quot;, is a moderate-size archeological ruin in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. It is part of the Lagunas de Montebello National Park.

This pre-Columbian city belongs to the ancient Maya civilization. The city flourished in the Maya Classic Era, from about the 3rd through the 9th century. Most of the sculptures were produced in the last 300 years of this era, with hieroglyphic inscriptions dating from 591 to 897. Post-Classic-Era occupation of the site continued until the 13th century, after which it was abandoned.

The site has some step-pyramids and some 200 smaller buildings, most in undisturbed ruin. Chinkultic has carved stone stelae depicting the site&#x27;s rulers. The site contains a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, which a marker tells us was dedicated on 21 May 591.

The first published account of the site was made by Edward Seler in the late 19th century. A detailed description of the site was made by Enrique Juan Palacios in 1926.

The first archeological investigations of the site were conducted in 1966 under the direction of Stephan F. de Borhegyi of the Public Museum of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Starting in 1970, some further excavations and restorations of a few buildings was conducted by Mexican government archeologists, who also dredged some artifacts from the site&#x27;s &quot;cenote&quot; or natural well known as &quot;Agua Azul&quot; (&quot;Blue Water&quot;). The cenote gives the site its Maya language name; &quot;Chinkultic&quot; meaning &quot;stepped-cenote&quot;.

The site is open for tourism visits, although it is not one of the more commonly visited Maya sites.

<text>Shattered Galaxy is a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game (MMORTS) that was released in 2000 by KRU Interactive, now known as Nexon Inc., after an extensive open beta period. In the US, it was published by Tri Synergy. It combines the attributes of a massive multiplayer online role-playing game and a real-time strategy game. Having won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the 2001 Independent Games Festival and hosted through the Game Developers Conference, the game has been commercially unsuccessful due in large part to its dated graphics engine. The game was published under the name Tactical Commanders in South Korea, published by Nexon until December 31, 2005. This game has also been serviced in Japan, Taiwan, and Germany.

==Plot==
&quot;Shattered Galaxy&quot; is set in a post-apocalyptic future. A teleportation device was found buried on Earth&#x27;s surface, though scientists were not able to master its secrets. Various non-living substances were successfully sent through and retrieved, but when a common rat was inserted into the portal, it activated the artifact in an unexpected way: the device immediately teleported itself, as well as all matter in a 2000 kilometer wide radius around it, to the planet Morgana Prime. The player is one of the survivors of this incident. The planet itself was devoid of sentient life, but robotic war machines were found on its surface, and humans have since learned to control them telepathically (allowing the humans themselves to stay out of harm&#x27;s way). Humans have since expanded to another planet (server) in the Morgana system, Relic, where wars likewise rage.

==Gameplay==
==Development==
As of September 2008, the game can be played using a basic account at no charge with a few minor handicaps or upgraded to an elite account at a cost of US$9.95 per month to play with all limitations removed.

Nexon has closed Tactical Commanders&#x27; service in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. As of October 2008, the German service was closed due to lack of players.

==Reception==
John Lee for &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave it three stars out of five and called it a &quot;decent&quot; persistent online game that requires a teamwork.

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;Shattered Galaxy&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s &quot;Best Independent PC Game&quot; prize, but lost to &quot;Serious Sam: The First Encounter&quot;.

<text>Lombard Street is an east–west street in San Francisco, California, that is famous for a steep, one-block section with eight hairpin turns. The street stretches 
from The Presidio east to The Embarcadero (with a gap on Telegraph Hill). Most of Lombard Street&#x27;s western segment is a major thoroughfare designated as part of U.S. Route 101. The famous one-block section, claimed to be &quot;the crookedest street in the world&quot;, is located along the eastern segment in the Russian Hill neighborhood. It is a major tourist attraction, receiving around two million visitors per year and up to 17,000 per day on busy summer weekends, as of 2015.

San Francisco surveyor Jasper O&#x27;Farrell named the road after Lombard Street in Philadelphia.

==Route description==
Lombard Street&#x27;s west end is at Presidio Boulevard inside The Presidio; it then heads east through the Cow Hollow neighborhood. For 12 blocks, between Broderick Street and Van Ness Avenue, it is an arterial road that is co-signed as U.S. Route 101. Lombard Street continues through the Russian Hill neighborhood and to the Telegraph Hill neighborhood. At Telegraph Hill it turns south, becoming Telegraph Hill Boulevard to Pioneer Park and Coit Tower. Lombard Street starts again at Winthrop Street and ends at The Embarcadero as a collector road.

Lombard Street is known for the one-way block on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, where eight sharp turns are said to make it the most crooked street in the world. The design, first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and built in 1922, was intended to reduce the hill&#x27;s natural 27 percent grade, which was too steep for most vehicles. The crooked block is about long ( straight line), is one-way (downhill) and is paved with red bricks. The sign at the top recommends .

The segment normally sees around 250 vehicles per hour, with average daily traffic reaching 2,630 vehicles in 2013. During peak times, vehicles have to wait up to 20 minutes to enter the Crooked Street segment, in a queue that can reach Van Ness Avenue.
To reduce habitual congestion and delays, future visitors may be required to reserve a time and pay a fee to drive down the crooked street.

The Powell-Hyde cable car stops at the top of the block on Hyde Street.

By 2017, the area around the curved segment had become a hot-spot of what has been described as &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s car break-in epidemic.&quot; This may in part have been due to its heavy traffic and association with tourism.

The Academy of Art University owns and operates a building called Star Hall on the street for housing purposes.

Past residents of Lombard Street include Rowena Meeks Abdy, an early California painter who worked in the style of Impressionism.

Chase scenes in many films have been filmed on the street, including &quot;Good Neighbor Sam,&quot; &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine,&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?,&quot; and &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp.&quot; Lombard Street is also portrayed in the 2015 Pixar film &quot;Inside Out&quot;, and is referenced by Bill Cosby on his 1965 comedy album &quot;Why Is There Air?&quot;.

<text>Barrimore Matthew &quot;Barry&quot; St. Leger (bapt. 1 May 1733 – 23 December 1793) was a British Army officer. St. Leger was active in the Saratoga Campaign, commanding an invasion force that unsuccessfully besieged Fort Stanwix. St. Leger remained on the frontier for the duration of the war; after its conclusion, he served briefly as commander of British forces in Quebec.

==Life==
St. Leger was baptised on 1 May 1733 in County Kildare, Ireland. He was a younger son of Sir John St Leger, a leading Irish judge and politician, and his second wife Lavina Pennefather. He was the brother of Gen. Anthony St Leger (British Army officer), the founder of the St Leger Stakes. The St Legers of Kildare were a junior branch of the family of Viscount Doneraile, and the Pennefathers were a wealthy landowning family in County Tipperary. He was educated at Eton College, and then at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

He joined the British Army in April 1756, serving as an ensign in the 28th Regiment of Foot. He saw service in the French and Indian War under the command of Jeffery Amherst at the 1758 siege of Louisbourg, and in 1759 under the command of James Wolfe at the Siege of Quebec. He was appointed brigade-major in July 1760 and served as a staff officer in the campaign against Montreal under James Murray. On 16 September 1762, St. Leger was promoted to major in the 95th Regiment of Foot.

When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, St. Leger was a lieutenant colonel in the 34th Regiment of Foot. He saw service in the 1776 British relief of Quebec following the Continental Army&#x27;s 1775 invasion of that province.

He was selected to lead the western offensive that formed one leg of the 1777 Saratoga campaign. John Burgoyne breveted him as brigadier general for this mission so that he would outrank the militia officers involved. He moved a mixed force of British regulars, Hessians, Indians, Canadiens, and Loyalists up the Saint Lawrence River to Fort Oswego, and from there to Fort Stanwix (the site of modern Rome, New York). The fort was more strongly defended than he and Burgoyne had anticipated, so he laid siege to it. When word arrived that an American relief column was approaching to break the siege, he sent a group of mostly Indians and Loyalists to oppose them. They ambushed Nicholas Herkimer&#x27;s force in the Battle of Oriskany, but the fort&#x27;s occupants sortied and raided their camp.

When reports of a relief force under Benedict Arnold reached him he was abandoned by his Indian supporters, and was forced to withdraw back to Quebec. He then tried to join up with Burgoyne&#x27;s army near Saratoga, but had only reached Fort Ticonderoga by the time Burgoyne surrendered his army in October 1777.

For the next several years, St. Leger was a leader of the British frontier war against the Americans. He was promoted to colonel in 1780. In 1781, he led an attempt to kidnap General Philip Schuyler. He was also involved in the secret negotiations between Frederick Haldimand, Quebec&#x27;s governor, and the Vermont Republic&#x27;s leaders over the possibility of bringing Vermont into the British fold. These negotiations ended with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.

Following the war, he remained in Quebec, and briefly commanded the British forces there in 1784. He resigned his commission the following year due to ill health, and died in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England, on 23 December 1793. His Will was proved on 14 February 1794 at the PCC London by Frances St. Leger, widow.

<doc id="401340" wikidata="Q7331712" url="?curid=401340" title="Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality">
<text>Former Republican U.S. Senator and 2012 and 2016 U.S. Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is opposed to homosexuality, seeing it as antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family. Santorum does not believe the right to privacy under the United States Constitution covers sexual acts, and criticized the US Supreme Court ruling in the case of &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; that ruled to the contrary. Santorum has stated that the U.S. military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy, which ended in 2011, should be reinstated and has voiced his opposition to same-sex parenting. Santorum&#x27;s views provoked criticism from Democratic politicians and other groups, but have been supported by some conservative Christians.

==2003 interview==
When asked for his position on the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in 2003, Santorum said that the scandal involved priests and post-pubescent men in &quot;a basic homosexual relationship&quot; (rather than child sexual abuse), which led the interviewer to ask if homosexuality should be outlawed.

Santorum then brought up the then-pending U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which challenged a Texas sodomy law, and said that &quot;he did not have a problem with homosexuals, but a problem with homosexual acts&quot;, &quot;the right to privacy doesn&#x27;t exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution&quot;, and &quot;sodomy laws properly exist to prevent acts which undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family.&quot;

When asked &quot;if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?&quot; Santorum stated:
The AP also quoted Santorum as saying, &quot;If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything.&quot; and &quot;Whether it&#x27;s polygamy, whether it&#x27;s adultery, whether it&#x27;s sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.&quot;

In response to attacks from WorldNetDaily, the interviewer made a recording of the interview available. The AP released a transcript it described as &quot;an unedited section&quot; of the interview on April 23.

==Public reaction==
Santorum&#x27;s comments evoked responses ranging from George W. Bush&#x27;s remark, relayed through spokesperson Ari Fleischer, that &quot;the President believes that the senator is an inclusive man&quot;, to sharp criticism from former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean that &quot;gay-bashing is not a legitimate public policy discussion; it is immoral&quot;, to conservative groups such as the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for America who came to Santorum&#x27;s defense.

Dean called on Santorum, &quot;to resign from his post as Republican Conference chairman.&quot; Other Democratic politicians who responded included Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who remarked that Santorum&#x27;s comments were &quot;out of step with our country&#x27;s respect for tolerance&quot;. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee demanded that Santorum resign as chairman of the Republican Senate Caucus. Brad Woodhouse of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called the comments, &quot;divisive, hurtful and reckless.&quot; Santorum faced criticism for his comments from Republican Senators including Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, Lincoln Chafee, and Gordon H. Smith. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona stated, &quot;I think that he may have been inartful in the way that he described it.&quot;

Critics of the statement included the Log Cabin Republicans, and the Republican Unity Coalition. LGBT rights groups which condemned the comments by Santorum included the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, OutFront, the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign. The conservative Christian group Concerned Women for America agreed with Santorum&#x27;s comments in a written statement. The group said Santorum was &quot;exactly right&quot; and attributed criticism of Santorum to the &quot;gay thought police&quot;. Director of Concerned Women for America&#x27;s Culture and Family Institute, Robert Knight, criticized those Republicans who spoke out against Santorum, &quot;Maybe they ought to think about switching parties. It shows great disloyalty to their party to join the sworn enemies in calling for the head [of Santorum]. They&#x27;re doing their party a great disservice.&quot; Vice President for Communications at the conservative Family Research Council Genevieve Wood supported Santorum&#x27;s remarks, and commented, &quot;I think the Republican party would do well to follow Senator Santorum if they want to see pro-family voters show up on Election Day.&quot; Conservative publications released articles supporting Santorum&#x27;s comments, including &quot;National Review&quot; with a piece by the philosopher Robert P. George, and Townhall.com in an opinion piece by the political commentator Ben Shapiro.

In a follow-up statement released after the Associated Press interview was published, Santorum said some of his remarks were &quot;taken out of context&quot;, and defended his comments in the interview asserting &quot;It is simply a reflection of the law.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Fox News Channel&quot;, Santorum said he was not going to apologize for his remarks, &quot;I do not need to give an apology based on what I said and what I&#x27;m saying now – I think this is a legitimate public policy discussion. These are not ridiculous comments. These are very much a very important point.&quot; In 2015, during an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show, he expressed regret for associating homosexuality with bestiality.

Santorum defended his remarks, declaring that his comments were not intended to equate homosexuality with incest and adultery, but rather to challenge the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults, a position he disputes, because he does not believe that there is a general constitutional right to privacy.

===Campaign for a &quot;santorum&quot; neologism ===

Dan Savage, a widely syndicated columnist and LGBT+ rights activist who was offended by Santorum&#x27;s remarks, hosted a contest in his &quot;Savage Love&quot; column for readers to create a definition for &quot;santorum&quot;. He created a website, &quot;spreadingsantorum.com&quot;, for the winning definition, &quot;The frothy mix of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex&quot;. This became a top internet search result for &quot;santorum&quot; in 2003, displacing the Senator&#x27;s official website on many search engines, including Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing. &quot;Some observers even suggested [the neologism] may have contributed to Santorum’s crushing 18-point defeat in his 2006 campaign against Bob Casey.&quot;

In 2011, during his presidential campaign, Santorum requested Google&#x27;s assistance to end the return of certain search results, but Google said there was nothing it could do. As late as 2019, Savage&#x27;s &quot;santorum&quot; website remained the top result of a Google search for &quot;santorum&quot;. Savage&#x27;s ownership of the site has since lapsed.

==2012 presidential campaign==
While campaigning in New Hampshire, Santorum engaged college students who asked about his position on same-sex marriage and suggested that allowing it would lead to the legalization of polygamy and other forms of marriage. The exchange resulted in him being booed at the conclusion of the event. At another event, Santorum said that children would be better off having a father in prison than being raised by lesbian parents.

On September 22, 2011, during a Republican primary debate in Orlando, Florida, Santorum replied to a question posed by a gay soldier deployed in Iraq who asked the candidates whether, as president, they would take measures to &quot;circumvent&quot; the repeal of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;. Instead of answering, Santorum replied:

<doc id="401342" wikidata="Q864007" url="?curid=401342" title="Deep South">
<text>The Deep South or the Lower South is a cultural and geographic subregion of the Southern United States. The term was first used to describe the states which were most economically dependent on plantations and slavery, specifically Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, the region suffered economic hardship and was a major site of racial tension during and after the Reconstruction era. 

Before 1945, the Deep South was often referred to as the &quot;Cotton States&quot; since cotton was the primary cash crop for economic production. The civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s helped usher in a new era, sometimes referred to as the New South. The Deep South is part of the highly religious, socially conservative Bible Belt and is politically a stronghold of the Republican Party. It is contrasted with the Mid-South and Tidewater region, as well as the Upper South and the border states.

==Usage==

The term &quot;Deep South&quot; is defined in a variety of ways. Most definitions include the following states: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Texas and Florida are sometimes included, due to being peripheral states, having coastlines with the Gulf of Mexico, their history of slavery, large African American populations, and once being part of the Confederate States of America. 

The eastern part of Texas is the westernmost extension of the Deep South, typically the area east of Dallas. North Florida is also part of the Deep South region, typically the area north of Ocala. West Tennessee is sometimes included due to its history of slavery, its prominence in cotton production during the antebellum period, and cultural similarity to the Mississippi Delta region. The Arkansas Delta is also sometimes included, though Arkansas is usually considered part of the Upper South. 

Seven states seceded from the United States before the firing on Fort Sumter and the start of the American Civil War, which originally formed the Confederate States of America. In order of secession, they are South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. 

The first six states to secede were those that held the largest percentage of slaves. Ultimately, the Confederacy included eleven states. A large part of the original &quot;Cotton Belt&quot; is sometimes included in Deep South terminology. This was considered to extend from South Carolina Lowcountry to Georgia and North Florida, through the Gulf States as far west as East Texas, including West Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, and up the Mississippi embayment. 

The inner core of the Deep South, characterized by very rich black soil that supported cotton plantations, is a geological formation known as the Black Belt. The Black Belt has since become better known as a sociocultural region; in this context it is a term used for much of the Cotton Belt, which had a high percentage of African-American slave labor. The Mississippi Delta has been called &quot;The Most Southern Place on Earth&quot;, because of its unique racial, cultural, and economic history.

==Origins==
The colony of South Carolina was dominated by a planter class who initially migrated from the British Caribbean island of Barbados, and used the Barbados Slave Code of 1661 as a model to control and terrorize the African American slave population. Barbados provided a steady flow of sugar produced by slave labor to Europe and North America. The Georgia colony was initially founded by James Oglethorpe as a buffer state to defend the southern British colonies from Spanish Florida. Oglethorpe imagined a province populated by &quot;sturdy farmers&quot; who could guard the border; because of this, the colony&#x27;s charter prohibited slavery. Unfortunately, the ban on slavery was lifted by 1751, and the colony became a royal colony in 1752. 

At the time of the American Revolution, South Carolina and Georgia were majority African American, as indicated by the map on the right. In 1765, London philanthropist Dr. John Fothergill remarked on the cultural differences of the British American colonies southward from Maryland and those to the north, suggesting that Southerners were more similar to the people of the Caribbean than to the colonies to the north. A visiting French dignitary concurred in 1810 that American customs seemed &quot;entirely changed&quot; over the Potomac River, and that Southern society resembled those of the Caribbean.

Although often used in history books to refer to the seven states that originally formed the Confederacy, the term &quot;Deep South&quot; did not come into general usage until long after the Civil War ended. For at least the remainder of the 19th century, &quot;Lower South&quot; was the primary designation for those states. At the time of the American Civil War, Florida and Texas were sparsely populated and not fully settled, with Florida and Texas being the least-populated and third least-populated of the 11 Confederate states, respectively.

When &quot;Deep South&quot; first began to gain mainstream currency in print in the middle of the 20th century, it applied to the states and areas of South Carolina, Georgia, southern Alabama, northern Florida, Mississippi, northern Louisiana, West Tennessee, southern Arkansas, and eastern Texas, all historical areas of cotton plantations and slavery. This was the part of the South many considered the &quot;most Southern.&quot; In 1939, Florida was described as &quot;still very largely an empty State,&quot; with only North Florida largely settled until after World War II.

Later, the general definition expanded to include all of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, as well as often taking in bordering areas of Eastern Arkansas, West Tennessee, East Texas and North Florida. In its broadest application, the Deep South is considered to be &quot;an area roughly coextensive with the old cotton belt, from eastern North Carolina through South Carolina, west into East Texas, with extensions north and south along the Mississippi.&quot;

==Early economics==

The Deep South is generally associated historically with cotton production. The 11 Confederate States, including the Deep South, were overwhelmingly rural. New Orleans, Louisiana was the only populous city in the Confederacy during the Civil War.

After the Civil War, the region was economically poor. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, a small fraction of the white population composed of wealthy landowners, merchants and bankers controlled the economy and, largely, the politics. Most white farmers were poor and had to do manual work on their farms to survive. As prices fell, farmers&#x27; work became harder and longer because of a change from largely self-sufficient farms, based on corn and pigs, to the growing of a cash crop of cotton or tobacco. Cotton cultivation took twice as many hours of work as raising corn. The farmers lost their freedom to determine what crops they would grow, ran into increasing indebtedness, and many were forced into tenancy or into working for someone else. Some out-migration occurred, especially to Texas, but over time, the population continued to grow and the farms were subdivided smaller and smaller. Growing discontent helped give rise to the Populist movement in the early 1890s. It represented a sort of class warfare, in which the poor farmers sought to gain more of an economic and political voice.
===Distinct from neighboring regions===

By 1850, the term &quot;Cotton States&quot; was in common use, and the differences between the Deep South (lower) and Upland South (upper) were recognized. A key difference was the Deep South&#x27;s plantation-style cash crop agriculture (mainly cotton, rice and sugar), using the forced labor of enslaved African Americans on large farms while plantation owners tended to live in towns and cities. This system of plantation farming was originally developed in the Caribbean West Indies and introduced to the United States in South Carolina and Louisiana, from where it spread throughout the Deep South, although there were local exceptions wherever conditions did not support the system. The sharp division between town and country, the intensive use of a few cash crops, and the high proportion of slaves, all differed from the Upland South.

The Tidewater region, encompassing the Chesapeake Bay and Eastern North Carolina, stands out as different from both the Deep South and Upland South. Its history of slavery originated in Virginia and predated the Caribbean plantation model, relying on tobacco as a cash crop from the start. Tidewater had few urban centers, instead establishing multiple markets along tributaries. Cotton and rice operations were large and factory-like, while tobacco profits hinged on skilled, careful, and efficient labor units. 

Despite being the southernmost part of the continental United States, South Florida is not considered part of the Deep South. It has a tropical climate and high levels of migration from the Caribbean and Latin America, particularly in the densely populated Miami metropolitan area.

==From Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Movement==

After 1950, the region became a major center of the Civil Rights Movement, including: the work of Martin Luther King Jr., the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, the 1960 founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and the 1964 Freedom Summer.

==Major cities and urban areas==
The Deep South has three major Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) located solely within its boundaries, with populations exceeding 1,000,000 residents (Four including Memphis). Atlanta, the 8th largest metro area in the United States, is the Deep South&#x27;s largest population center, followed by Memphis, New Orleans, and Birmingham.
===Metropolitan areas===
The 17 Deep South metropolitan areas (MSAs) within the 150 largest population centers in the United States are ranked below:

Other substantial cities include: 
Other cities sometimes included as part of the Deep South: 

== Climate ==

As part of the Sun Belt and Atlantic Plain, the Deep South tends to have a Subtropical climate with long hot summers and short mild winters. The 35th parallel north, which is used to define the northern boundary of the subtropics, defines the southern border of Tennessee, and the border between North Carolina and Georgia.
The climate tends to display more pronounced Subtropical characteristics the closer one gets to the Gulf Coast. For example, the Deep South substantially overlaps with the range of the American alligator. 

Crops grow readily in the Deep South due to its climate consistently providing growing seasons of at least six months before the first frost. Some common environments include bayous and swamplands, as well as the southern pine forests. Due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean, hurricanes are also a frequently-occurring natural disaster. 

Booker T. Washington wrote in his 1901 autobiography
I have often been asked to define the term &quot;Black Belt&quot;. So far as I can learn, the term was first used to designate a part of the country which was distinguished by the colour of the soil. The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later, and especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white.

==People==

Most White people in the Deep South who identified themselves with one European ethnic group in the 1980 census self-identified as English. This occurred in every southern state with the exception of Louisiana where more White people self-identified as French than English. A large number of the White population also derives from ethnic groups of Ireland (Irish and Ulster Scots).
With regard to White people in the Deep South who reported only a single European-American ancestry group, the 1980 census showed the following self-identification in each state in this region:
*Alabama – 857,864 of 2,165,653 respondents (41%) self-identified as English only, which was the state&#x27;s largest ancestral group by a wide margin.
*Georgia – 1,132,184 of 3,009,486 respondents (37.62%) self-identified as English only.
*Mississippi – 496,481 of 1,551,364 respondents (32%) self-identified as English only, which was the state&#x27;s largest ancestral group by a wide margin.
*Florida – 1,132,033 of 5,159,967 respondents (21.94%) self-identified as English only.
*Louisiana – 480,711 of 2,319,259 respondents (20.73%) self-identified as French only, followed closely by 440,558 English-only respondents (19%). 
*South Carolina – 578,338 of 1,706,966 respondents (33.88%) self-identified as English only. This is likely due to the fact that British colonization along the coasts of present-day South Carolina began earlier than colonization of other areas commonly classified as the Deep South. 
*Texas – 1,639,322 of 7,859,393 respondents (20.86%) self-identified as English only, which was the state&#x27;s largest ancestral group by a large margin.

These figures do not take into account people who self-identified as English and some other ancestral group. When the two were added together, people who self-identified as being English with other ancestry, made up an even larger portion of southerners. 
, the majority of Black Americans in the South live in the Black Belt in the American South from Virginia to Texas. 

Hispanic and Latino Americans largely started arriving in the Deep South during the 1990s, and their numbers have grown rapidly. Politically they have not been very active.

==Politics==

Political expert Kevin Phillips states that, &quot;From the end of Reconstruction until 1948, the Deep South Black Belts, where only whites could vote, were the nation&#x27;s leading Democratic Party bastions.&quot;

From the late 1870s to the mid-1960s, conservative whites of the Deep South held control of state governments and overwhelmingly identified with and supported the Democratic Party. The most powerful leaders belonged to the party&#x27;s moderate-to-conservative wing. The Republican Party would only control mainly mountain districts in Southern Appalachia, on the fringe of the Deep South, during the &quot;Solid South&quot; period.

At the turn of the 20th century, all Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed new constitutions and other laws that effectively disenfranchised the great majority of blacks and sometimes many poor whites as well. Blacks were excluded subsequently from the political system entirely. The white Democratic-dominated state legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to impose white supremacy, including caste segregation of public facilities. In politics, the region became known for decades as the &quot;Solid South&quot;. While this disenfranchisement was enforced, all of the states in this region were mainly one-party states dominated by white Southern Democrats. Southern representatives accrued outsized power in the Congress and the national Democratic Party, as they controlled all the seats apportioned to southern states based on total population, but only represented the richer subset of their white populations. In the 1928 presidential election, Al Smith received serious backlash as a Catholic, but carried all 5 Deep South states, though he nearly lost Alabama.

Major demographic changes would ensue in the 20th century. During the two waves of the Great Migration (1916–1970), a total of six million African Americans left the South for the Northeast, Midwest, and West, to escape the oppression and violence in the South. Beginning with the Goldwater–Johnson election of 1964, a significant contingent of white conservative voters in the Deep South stopped supporting national Democratic Party candidates and switched to the Republican Party. They still would vote for many Democrats at the state and local level into the 1990s. Political scientist Seth McKee concluded that in the 1964 presidential election, &quot;Once again, the high level of support for Goldwater in the Deep South, and especially their Black Belt counties, spoke to the enduring significance of white resistance to black progress.&quot;

White southern voters consistently voted for the Democratic Party for many years to hold onto Jim Crow Laws. Once Franklin D. Roosevelt came to power in 1932, the limited southern electorate found itself supporting Democratic candidates who frequently did not share its views. Journalist Matthew Yglesias argues:

Kevin Phillips states that, &quot;Beginning in 1948, however, the white voters of the Black Belts shifted partisan gears and sought to lead the Deep South out of the Democratic Party. Upcountry, pineywoods and bayou voters felt less hostility towards the New Deal and Fair Deal economic and caste policies which agitated the Black Belts, and for another decade, they kept The Deep South in the Democratic presidential column.

In the 1968 election, George Wallace carried all five Deep South states except for South Carolina, as well as Arkansas. Phillips emphasizes the three-way 1968 presidential election:

Wallace won very high support from Black Belt whites and no support at all from Black Belt Negroes. In the Black Belt counties of the Deep South, racial polarization was practically complete. Negroes voted for Hubert Humphrey, whites for George Wallace. GOP nominee Nixon garnered very little backing and counties where Barry Goldwater had captured 90 percent to 100 percent of the vote in 1964.

The Republican Party in the South had been crippled by the disenfranchisement of blacks, and the national party was unable to relieve their past with the South where Reconstruction was negatively viewed. During the Great Depression and the administration of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, some New Deal measures were promoted as intending to aid African Americans across the country and in the poor rural South, as well as poor whites. In the post-World War II era, Democratic Party presidents and national politicians began to support desegregation and other elements of the Civil Rights Movement, from President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s desegregating the military, to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s support for non-violent protests. These efforts culminated in Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s important work in gaining Congressional approval for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Since then, upwards of 90 percent of African Americans in the South have voted for the Democratic Party, including 93 percent for Obama in 2012.

===Late 20th century to present===
Historian Thomas Sugrue attributes the political and cultural changes, along with the easing of racial tensions, as the reason why Southern voters began to vote for Republican national candidates, in line with their political ideology. Since then, white Deep South voters have tended to vote for Republican candidates in most presidential elections. Times the Democratic Party has won in the Deep South since the late 20th century include: the 1976 election when Georgia native Jimmy Carter received the Democratic nomination, the 1980 election when Carter won Georgia; the 1992 election when Arkansas native and former governor Bill Clinton won Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas, the 1996 election when the incumbent president Clinton again won Louisiana, Tennessee and Arkansas, and when Georgia was won by Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election.

In 1995, Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich was elected by representatives of a Republican-dominated House as Speaker of the House. The incumbent Speaker of the House since October 2023, Republican Mike Johnson, is from Louisiana.

Since the 1990s the white majority has continued to shift toward Republican candidates at the state and local levels. This trend culminated in 2014 when the Republicans swept every statewide office in the Deep South region midterm elections. As a result, the Republican party came to control all the state legislatures in the region, as well as all House seats that were not representing majority-minority districts.

Presidential elections in which the Deep South diverged noticeably from the Upper South occurred in 1928, 1948, 1964, 1968, and, to a lesser extent, in 1952, 1956, 1992, and 2008. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee fared well in the Deep South in the 2008 Republican primaries, losing only one state (South Carolina) while running (he had dropped out of the race before the Mississippi primary).

Georgia is currently considered a Swing state. In the 2020 presidential election, the state of Georgia was considered a toss-up state hinting at a possible Democratic shift in the area. It ultimately voted Democratic, in favor of Joe Biden. During the 2021 January Senate runoff elections, Georgia also voted for two Democrats, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, with Warnock winning re-election to a full term the following year. Republicans currently hold every statewide office, its state Supreme Court, and its legislature.

==States==
From colonial times to the early twentieth century, much of the Lower South had a black majority. Three Southern states had populations that were majority-black: Louisiana (from 1810 until about 1890), South Carolina (until the 1920s), and Mississippi (from the 1830s to the 1930s). In the same period, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida had populations that were nearly 50% black, while Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia had black populations approaching or exceeding 40%. Texas&#x27; black population reached 30%.

The demographics of these states changed markedly from the 1890s through the 1950s, as two waves of the Great Migration led more than 6,500,000 African-Americans to abandon the economically depressed, segregated Deep South in search of better employment opportunities and living conditions, first in Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, and later west to California. One-fifth of Florida&#x27;s black population had left the state by 1940, for instance. During the last thirty years of the twentieth century into the twenty-first century, scholars have documented a reverse New Great Migration of black people back to southern states, but typically to destinations in the New South, which have the best jobs and developing economies.

The District of Columbia, one of the magnets for black people during the Great Migration, was long the sole majority-minority federal jurisdiction in the continental U.S. The black proportion has declined since the 1990s due to gentrification and expanding opportunities, with many black people moving to southern states such as Texas, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland and others migrating to jobs in states of the New South in a reverse of the Great Migration.

<text>El Nabatat Island or Kitchener&#x27;s Island ( Geziret En Nabatat (&quot;Plant Island&quot;) or the Botanical Island) is a small, oval-shaped island in the Nile at Aswan, Egypt. It is less than a kilometer long and its width is less than ½ a kilometer. The Aswan Botanical Garden is located on the island.

==Geography==
El Nabatat Island is one of two major islands on the Nile in the vicinity of Aswan, the other one being Elephantine. Elephantine is the larger one, and is located between El Nabatat Island and the city of Aswan (east bank). Therefore, it can be hard to see the smaller El Nabatat Island from Aswan: &quot;Aswan disappears behind Elephantine Island&quot;.

==History==
The island was previously known as Kitchener&#x27;s Island, named after Lord Kitchener who owned it.
He was gifted the island when he served as Consul-General in Egypt from 29 September 1911 to June 1914.

With the aid of the Ministry of Irrigation, Kitchener rapidly transformed the small long island into a paradise of exotic trees, many from India, and plants in gardens with view walkways. It later passed into the property of the Egyptian government and was used as a research station called the Botanical Research Institute, Aswân Botanic Island.

==Aswan Botanical Garden==
The island, as a whole, constitutes the Aswan Botanical Garden. One can view the many types of subtropical, exotic, and rare plantings and trees such as the royal palm tree and the sabal palm tree. The collection was begun by Lord Kitchener and has been cared for since. The gardens are popular among the local people and tourists as a place to go for a quiet afternoon away from the noise of the city, and for weekend picnics. The island and gardens can be reached by felucca that reach the southeastern side of the small island.

<text>King William Street is a street in the City of London, the historic nucleus and modern financial centre of London. It is a two-way street linking Lombard Street, at its northern end, with London Bridge, which marks the start of the start of the A3 route to Portsmouth.

==Geography==

King William Street runs from its northern end at a junction with Lombard Street by the church of St Mary Woolnoth, southeast to Monument junction, where it meets Gracechurch Street and Cannon Street. King William Street then continues south into London Bridge. The nearest London Underground stations are Bank and Monument; the former King William Street station was once sited on the road, at the corner of Monument Street.

The road was built between 1829 and 1835 and is named after the reigning monarch of the time, King William IV. From 1844 to 1936 a Statue of William IV sat on a column in the street before being relocated to King William Walk in Greenwich. In 1902 King William Street was the scene of the fatal stabbing of Arthur Reginald Baker by his lover Kitty Byron, at an entrance to the Lombard Street post office which at that time was located on King William Street. Today, it houses a number of investment banks and City firms.

==Notable buildings==
* No. 1, was originally constructed as the head office of the London Assurance Corporation on the site of the first clubhouse of the Gresham Club. It has housed the Rothschild headquarters.
* No. 5, erected in 1915, on a design by John Macvicar Anderson and his son Henry Lennox Anderson, head office of the Phoenix Assurance Company from 1915 to 1983.
* No. 68, erected in 1920–1922, also designed by Henry Lennox Anderson, for the Guardian Assurance Company
* No. 81, erected in 1925–1927 as the head office of the London Life Association, designed by William Curtis Green.
* Adelaide House, a Grade II listed building, is located at the far southern end of King William Street, adjacent to London Bridge. 
* Opposite and also adjacent to the bridge is Fish Hall, the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.

==In literature==

King William Street is mentioned in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. Lines 60–68 read:

At the time he wrote this section, Eliot was working for a bank in the City.

<text>Kaffe is a discontinued &quot;clean room design&quot; (reverse engineering) version of a Java Virtual Machine. It comes with a subset of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), Java API, and tools needed to provide a Java runtime environment. Like most other Free Java virtual machines, Kaffe uses GNU Classpath as its class library.

Kaffe, first released in 1996, was the original open-source Java implementation. Initially developed as part of another project, it grew so popular that developers Tim Wilkinson and Peter Mehlitz founded Transvirtual Technologies, Inc. with Kaffe as the company&#x27;s flagship product. In July 1998, Transvirtual released Kaffe OpenVM under a GNU General Public License.

Kaffe is a lean and portable virtual machine, although it is significantly slower than commercial implementations. When compared to the reference implementation of the Java Virtual Machine written by Sun Microsystems, Kaffe was significantly smaller; it thus appeals to embedded system developers. It comes with just-in-time compilers for many of the CPU architectures, and has been ported to more than 70 system platforms in total. It runs on devices ranging from embedded SuperH devices to IBM zSeries mainframe computers, and it will even run on a PlayStation 2.

Unlike other implementations, in the past Kaffe used GNU Multi-Precision Library (GMP) to support arbitrary precision arithmetic. This feature has been removed from release 1.1.9, causing protests from people that claim they used Kaffe for the sole reason of GMP arithmetic being faster than the typical pure java implementation, available in other distributions. The capability was removed to reduce the maintenance work, expecting that interested people will integrate GMP support into GNU Classpath or OpenJDK. Subsequently, GNU Classpath introduced GMP support in version 0.98.

<text>Haight-Ashbury () is a district of San Francisco, California, named for the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets. It is also called the Haight and the Upper Haight. The neighborhood is known as one of the main centers of the counterculture of the 1960s.

==Location==
The district generally encompasses the neighborhood surrounding Haight Street, bounded by Stanyan Street and Golden Gate Park on the west, Oak Street and the Golden Gate Park Panhandle on the north, Baker Street and Buena Vista Park to the east and Frederick Street and Ashbury Heights and Cole Valley neighborhoods to the south.

The street names commemorate two early San Francisco leaders: pioneer and exchange banker Henry Haight, and Munroe Ashbury, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 1864 to 1870.

Both Haight and his nephew, as well as Ashbury, had a hand in the planning of the neighborhood and nearby Golden Gate Park at its inception. The name &quot;Upper Haight&quot; is also used by locals in contrast to the Haight-Fillmore or Lower Haight.

The Beats had congregated around San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach neighborhood from the late 1950s. Many who could not find accommodation there turned to the quaint, relatively cheap and underpopulated Haight-Ashbury.

Haight-Ashbury would later become notable for its role as one of the main centers of the hippie movement. The Summer of Love (1967) and much of the counterculture of the 1960s have been synonymous with San Francisco and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood ever since.

==History==

===Indigenous history===

The present day Haight-Ashbury area is situated on land that was first inhabited by the Ramaytush Ohlone people, a network of Native American tribes that lived in the San Francisco Bay region. The Ohlone were hunter-gatherers and lived in their communities for thousands of years before the Spanish colonised the region.

===Spanish colonial period===

In 1776, Spanish colonists began founding missions in the Bay Area to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The Spanish placed indigenous peoples including the Ohlone into forced labour systems and diseases killed a major part of indigenous populations, leading to the fragmentation of indigenous cultures and ways of life.

===Mexican era (1821–1848)===

Mexico&#x27;s gained independence from Spain in 1822 and thus took control of California. This led to mission lands in the Bay Area to be secularized and land being granted to private individuals. The present day Haight-Ashbury area stayed largely unsettled due to its inhospitable topography of sand dunes and was mostly limited to cattle grazing.

===Gold Rush era and early urbanization===

The discovery of gold in 1848 and the subsequent California Gold Rush saw a rapid increase in population and urbanization in San Francisco. Before the completion of the Haight Street Cable Railroad in 1883, what is now the Haight-Ashbury was a collection of isolated farms and acres of sand dunes. The Haight cable car line, completed in 1883, connected the east end of Golden Gate Park with the geographically central Market Street line and the rest of downtown San Francisco. As the primary gateway to Golden Gate Park, and with an amusement park known as the Chutes on Haight Street between Cole and Clayton Streets between 1895 and 1902 and the California League Baseball Grounds stadium opening in 1887, the area became a popular entertainment destination, especially on weekends. The cable car, land grading and building techniques of the 1890s and early 20th century later reinvented the Haight-Ashbury as a residential upper middle class homeowners&#x27; district. It was one of the few neighborhoods spared from the fires that followed the catastrophic San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The cable car lines and improvements in land grading and building techniques enabled the development of a residential area that catered to upper middle class homeowners.

===Depression and war===

The Haight was hit hard by the Depression, as was much of the city. Residents with enough money to spare left the declining and crowded neighborhood for greener pastures within the growing city limits, or newer, smaller suburban homes in the Bay Area. During World War II, the Edwardian and Victorian houses
were divided into apartments to house workers. Others were converted into boarding homes for profit. By the 1950s, the Haight was a neighborhood in decline. Many buildings were left vacant after the war. Deferred maintenance also took its toll, and the exodus of middle class residents to newer suburbs continued to leave many units for rent.

===Postwar===

In the 1950s, a freeway was proposed that would have run through the Panhandle, but due to a citizen freeway revolt, it was cancelled in a series of battles that lasted until 1966.
The Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council (HANC) was formed at the time of the 1959 revolt.

The Haight-Ashbury&#x27;s elaborately detailed, 19th century, multi-story, wooden houses became a haven for hippies during the 1960s, due to the availability of cheap rooms and vacant properties for rent or sale in the district; property values had dropped in part because of the proposed freeway.
The alternative culture that subsequently flourished there took root, and to some extent, has remained to this day.

===Hippie community===

The mainstream media&#x27;s coverage of hippie life in the Haight-Ashbury drew the attention of youth from all over America. Hunter S. Thompson labeled the district &quot;Hashbury&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, and the activities in the area were reported almost daily. The Haight-Ashbury district was sought out by hippies to constitute a community based upon counterculture ideals, drugs, and music. This neighborhood offered a concentrated gathering spot for hippies to create a social experiment that would soon spread throughout the nation.

The first head shop, Ron and Jay Thelin&#x27;s Psychedelic Shop, opened on Haight Street on January 3, 1966, offering hippies a spot to purchase marijuana and LSD, which was essential to hippie life in Haight-Ashbury. Along with businesses like the coffee shop The Blue Unicorn, the Psychedelic Shop quickly became one of the unofficial community centers for the growing numbers of hippies migrating to the neighborhood in 1966–67. The entire hippie community had easy access to drugs, which was perceived as a community unifier.

Another well-known neighborhood presence was the Diggers, a local &quot;community anarchist&quot; group known for its street theater, formed in the mid to late 1960s. One well known member of the group was Peter Coyote. The Diggers believed in a free society and the good in human nature. To express their belief, they established a free store, gave out free meals daily, and built a free medical clinic, which was the first of its kind, all of which relied on volunteers and donations. The Diggers were strongly opposed to a capitalistic society; they felt that by eliminating the need for money, people would be free to examine their own personal values, which would provoke people to change the way they lived to better suit their character, and thus lead a happier life.

During the 1967 Summer of Love, psychedelic rock music was entering the mainstream, receiving more and more commercial radio airplay. The Scott McKenzie song &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair),&quot; became a hit that year. The Monterey Pop Festival in June further cemented the status of psychedelic music as a part of mainstream culture and elevated local Haight bands such as the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Jefferson Airplane to national stardom. A July 7, 1967, &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story on &quot;The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture,&quot; an August CBS News television report on &quot;The Hippie Temptation&quot; and other major media interest in the hippie subculture exposed the Haight-Ashbury district to enormous national attention and popularized the counterculture movement across the country and around the world.

The neighborhood&#x27;s fame reached its peak as it became the haven for a number of psychedelic rock performers and groups of the time. The members of many bands lived close to the intersection. They not only immortalized the scene in song, but also knew many within the community.

The Summer of Love attracted a wide range of people of various ages: teenagers and college students drawn by their peers and the allure of joining a cultural utopia; middle-class vacationers; and even partying military personnel from bases within driving distance. The Haight-Ashbury could not accommodate this rapid influx of people, and the neighborhood scene quickly deteriorated. Overcrowding, homelessness, hunger, drug problems, and crime afflicted the neighborhood. Many people left in the autumn to resume their college studies. On October 6, 1967, in Buena Vista Park, those remaining in the Haight staged a mock funeral, Digger happening, &quot;The Death of the Hippie&quot; ceremony. News of the event was released by Ron Thelin on October 4, 1967, two days after the arrest of members of the Grateful Dead. Men shaved their beards and filled caskets to symbolize the dead hippie.

Mary Kasper explained the message of the mock funeral as:Ron Thelin stated that Haight-Ashbury was:
===Post-Summer of Love decline and Community Organizing (1968 – Mid-1970)===

After 1967, Haight-Ashbury saw a rapid departure of residents due to overcrowding, high crime rates, and drug abuse, yet certain institutions such the Free Medical Clinic remained. The Haight-Ashbury Neighborhood Council (HANC) which had been created in 1960 to prevent the Panhandle Parkway project joined various San Francisco neighborhood groups to highlight inequities within San Francisco&#x27;s political representation.
The HANC fought to preserve historic Queen Anne-style architecture in the neighborhood by lobbying and organising historic house tours. Additionally, it successfully rezoned parts of the neighbourhood to protect houses and deter developers and absentee owners or landlords. The Park Police Station was reopened in 1972 following the passing of Proposition K, in an effort to increase safety in the neighbourhood. Countercultural communes such as the Good Earth Commune continued to be active and supported low-income housing and community policing.

===Stabilization and cultural legacy (1970s–1990s)===

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Haight-Ashbury saw an influx of middle-class families investing in homes. This revitalized the local economy but modified the hippie identity of the neighborhood. The HANC lobbied against commercialization, in particular opposing urbanization and developmental projects aimed at bringing chains and multi-unit housing developments. Grassroots organising and local activism in Haight Ashbury solidified itself in the political culture and legacy businesses including bookstores, boutiques and cafes marketed the essence of the sixties counterculture. In the 1980s, the Haight also became an epicenter for the San Francisco comedy scene when a small coffee house near Haight Street, in Cole Valley, called The Other Café, 100 Carl Street at Cole Street (currently the restaurant &quot;Crepes on Cole&quot;) became a full-time comedy club that helped launch the careers of Robin Williams, Dana Carvey, and Whoopi Goldberg.

While the neighbourhood had been a place of convergence for the gay community in the 1960s, the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s caused the deaths and relocation of many gay residents in the Haight. Many gay bars, businesses and clubs shut down and were replaced with new businesses less catered to gay audiences, but existing cooperative medical and political establishments such as Haight Ashbury Free Clinic were instrumental in ensuring access to medical aid through their needle exchange program that decreased the spread of HIV/AIDS.

===Preservation, gentrification and cultural identity (2000s– present)===

Preservation efforts in the 1990s and onwards have emphasized the neighbourhood&#x27;s role as a pilgrimage site for countercultural history. The Doolan-Larson Building (located at Haight and Ashbury) was built in 1903 and became a symbol of the 1960s counterculture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 and has been operated by the non-profit San Francisco Heritage since 2018. The space has served as a collaborative space for community organisers and artists to preserve counter cultural legacy and foster community artistic expression.

Annual events like the Haight-Ashbury Street Fair and cultural festivals celebrate the area&#x27;s countercultural past. It has become a hotspot for tourists and locals alike, with walking tours, city-sponsored projects and boutiques or coffee shops tied to the counterculture ethos.
Gentrification has strongly impacted Haight-Ashbury and led to increased property values and rents, displacing long-term residents and hindering affordable housing efforts. However, affordable housing initiatives such as a 100% affordable housing project at 730 Stanyan Street (the former site of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant) have provided 160 affordable units for low- to moderate-income families and transitional-age youth who have experienced homelessness.

==Attractions and characteristics==
The Haight-Ashbury Street Fair is held each year attracting thousands of people, during which Haight Street is closed between Stanyan and Masonic to vehicular traffic, with one sound stage at each end.

<doc id="401351" wikidata="Q475941" url="?curid=401351" title="List of crossings of the River Thames">
<text>The River Thames is the second-longest river in the United Kingdom, passes through the capital city, and has many crossings.

Counting every channel – such as by its islands linked to only one bank – it is crossed by over 300 bridges. If taking cuts – excavated channels – to be measurements of river, its course west of Tilbury has 27 tunnels, six public ferries, one cable car link, and one ford. From end to end a channel of the Thames can be seen, mostly its main flow, which is passed over by 138 bridges. These are listed here with 2 former bridges and a seasonal festival bridge. Over 162 other bridges link to such places as typical or man-made islands or across an array of corollary and lesser side channels (backwaters), particularly in and around Oxford and the non-village channel of Ashton Keynes — these are not listed.

The river&#x27;s lower estuary is shallow – but wide – and has no crossing east of Tilbury, the easternmost half as most broadly defined which even extends to the end of the rivers Medway and Crouch.

==Barrier and boundary==
Until sufficient crossings were established, the river provided a formidable barrier for most of its course – in post-Roman Britain during the Dark Ages Belgic-Celtic tribal lands and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and subdivisions were defined by which side of the river they were on. In the latter&#x27;s system of English counties continued by predominantly Norman England and for some centuries thereafter, the river formed a mutual limit of counties. After rising in Gloucestershire, the river flows between, on the north bank, the historic counties of Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Middlesex and Essex; and on the south bank, the counties of Wiltshire, Berkshire, Surrey, and Kent. However the many permanent crossings that have been built over the centuries have changed the dynamics and made cross-river development and shared responsibilities more practicable.

In 1911 Caversham, on the north bank, was transferred into Berkshire. In 1965, with the creation of Greater London, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames united areas formerly in Middlesex and Surrey; and at the same time two urban districts in Middlesex (united in 1974) became part of Surrey. Further changes in 1974 moved some of the boundaries away from the river. For example, much of the north west of Berkshire including Wallingford, Abingdon and Wantage became part of Oxfordshire, and some southern parts of Buckinghamshire became part of Berkshire, including Slough, Eton and Wraysbury. The number of county councils has fallen (and some others have dwindled in area) in England in favour of increased localisation.

Lessening these last changes, in the sports of rowing and skiffing the river banks are referred to by their traditional county names, and in football and cricket the traditional counties also, often, persist.

==History of crossings==

The original crossings over the Thames would all have been fords- typically on gravel beds. Well known ones include Wallingford and Oxford, but it is likely that there was a prehistoric ford where the Romans built London Bridge. In the upper reaches of the Thames, the river depth was raised by dams and in the lower reaches it was raised by embankments, so gradually most fords were lost. At least one regular ford remains, at Duxford.

Many of the present road bridges over the river are on the sites of earlier fords, ferries and wooden structures. The earliest known major crossings of the Thames by the Romans were at London Bridge and Staines Bridge. At Folly Bridge in Oxford the remains of the Saxon forerunner can be seen, and medieval stone ones such as Wallingford, Newbridge in west Oxfordshire and Abingdon Bridges are still in use. In today&#x27;s south-west London lies Kingston Bridge, which was the only crossing between London Bridge and Staines until the beginning of the 18th century and has been twice widened since its completion.

Proposals to build bridges for Lambeth/Westminster and Putney/Fulham in around 1670 were defeated by the Rulers of the Company of Watermen, since it would cut the trade of the then 60,000 rivermen plying ferry services and who were noted as a pool of naval reserves. During the 18th century, many stone and brick instances were built – from new or to replace existing structures – in London and further up the river. These included Westminster, Putney, Datchet, Windsor and Sonning Bridges. Several central London road bridges were built in the 19th century, most conspicuously Tower Bridge, the only bascule bridge on the river, which enables some types of ocean-going ships to pass beneath it. The most recent road bridge sites are the bypasses at Isis Bridge and Marlow By-pass Bridge and for motorways such as the two for the M25: Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and M25 Runnymede Bridge.

The development of the railways resulted in a spate of bridge building in the 19th century, including Blackfriars and Charing Cross (Hungerford) Railway Bridges in central London, and the simple but majestic three, of grand arch design, by Isambard Kingdom Brunel at Maidenhead, Gatehampton and Moulsford.

The world&#x27;s first underwater tunnel was the Thames Tunnel by Marc Brunel built in 1843, designed for horse-drawn carriages but used as a pedestrian route; since 1869 the tunnel has carried trains on the East London Line. The Tower Subway (1870) was briefly used for a railway; later came all the deep-level tube lines. Two road tunnels were built in East London at the end of the 19th century, the Blackwall Tunnel and the Rotherhithe Tunnel; and the latest tunnel is the Dartford Crossing.

Many footbridges were made across the weirs that were built on the non-tidal river, and some of these remained when the locks were built, such as at Benson Lock. Some, above Oxford, have survived when the weir was lost, as at Hart&#x27;s Weir Footbridge. Around the year 2000 several were added, as part of the Thames Path or for the Millennium. These include Temple, Bloomers Hole, the Hungerford Footbridges and the Millennium Bridge in distinct, aesthetic but durable, forms.

Six ferries cross the river:
* The Woolwich Ferry is one of two in the Thames Gateway, linking the North and South Circular roads. The Gravesend–Tilbury Ferry further downstream is a pedestrian ferry only.
* Upstream of central London, the Hammertons Ferry is a passenger link between the tourist attractions of Ham House and Marble Hill House in Twickenham.
* Further upstream, the Hampton Ferry, the Sunbury Ferry, and the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry are all pedestrian ferries to the west of London.

==Note on the listing==

The list is from the estuary to the source. A few of the crossings listed are public foot bridges using walkways across lock gates and then bridges parallel to or on top of the associated weir(s) to the non-lock-associated bank. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and/or weirs, but these do not completely cross the river, or are restricted to authorised personnel only, and are therefore not listed.

Also operating are boat services, ranging from year-round in London to seven or fewer months (including the summer) serving upper stretches. Whilst their main purpose is not to carry people across the river, several bring about one or more crossings but usually not to points facing each other.

===Proposed===
* The Grain to Tilbury cable tunnel is a utility tunnel proposed by National Grid to replace the Thames Cable Tunnel, which is reaching the end of its service life.
* The Lower Thames Crossing is an awaiting-planning-consent road tunnel close to the Thames Cable Tunnel that may open in 2028.
* is a proposed tunnel to carry trams between Kent and Essex, as part of a proposed KenEx Transit network.

== East London ==
===Under construction===
* The Silvertown Tunnel began construction in August 2020 and will open on 7 April 2025. This will relieve the Blackwall Tunnels between the Greenwich Peninsula and West Silvertown and to allow larger HGVs and double-decker buses to cross the river at this point.

=== Proposed ===

* The Belvedere Crossing, a bridge between Belvedere and Rainham.
* The Gallions Reach Crossing has been proposed as a ferry, bridge, or tunnel between Beckton and Thamesmead.
* An extension of the Docklands Light Railway across the river to Thamesmead is proposed.
* The Rotherhithe crossing, a pedestrian and cycle crossing between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf, was originally proposed as a bridge, but Transport for London abandoned plans for a bridge in 2019, and has since explored establishing a ferry service instead.

== Central London ==
===Former===
* At least two &quot;Emergency Thames Bridges&quot; were erected as a precaution against destructions during World War II. The first was built from Victoria Embankment to County Hall, London in 1942 before being demolished in 1948. Between the same years stood another, between Millbank outside the Tate Britain and Lambeth.

=== Planned ===

* Nine Elms-Pimlico cycle and pedestrian bridge

== South West London ==
=== Planned ===
* Diamond Jubilee Footbridge, a pedestrian bridge adjacent to Battersea Railway Bridge, granted planning permission in 2013.
== London to Windsor ==
===Former===
* The Datchet Bridge, built in 1707, was demolished in 1848, and replaced by the Albert and Victoria bridges.

== Windsor to Reading ==
===Former===
* A footbridge was built in 2012, for the London Olympics, to enable spectators of the rowing events held at Dorney Lake to gain access from Windsor Racecourse. It was removed after the Olympics.

== Reading to Oxford ==
=== Planned ===
* Oxpens River Bridge (between Gasworks and Osney Rail Bridges in Oxford, 51°44&#x27;50.2&quot;N 1°15&#x27;56.0&quot;W) a footbridge, for completion in 2025.
== Oxford to Cricklade ==
== Cricklade to the source ==
Not all of the bridges above Cricklade are listed below. For example, there are a number of small agricultural bridges allowing access between fields, and bridges to properties in Ashton Keynes that are not mentioned.

The river splits as it passes through Ashton Keynes. An alternative route to that listed above crosses High Bridge at and Three Bridges at .

<text>The Theatre was an Elizabethan playhouse in Shoreditch (in Curtain Road, part of the modern London Borough of Hackney), just outside the City of London. Built in 1576, after the Red Lion, it was the first permanent theatre built exclusively for the showing of theatrical productions in England, and its first successful one. Actor-manager James Burbage built it near the family home in Holywell Street. The Theatre&#x27;s history includes a number of important acting troupes including the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, which employed Shakespeare as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the Globe Theatre on Bankside.

==History==
The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city. This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later the Clink, and at Newington Butts near the established entertainment district of St. George&#x27;s Fields in rural Surrey. The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one John Brayne, (the owner of the Red Lion) on property that had originally been the grounds of the dissolved Halliwell Priory (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne&#x27;s daughter Ellen in 1575). The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to theatre. This area in the &quot;suburbs of sin&quot; was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later, the Curtain Theatre was built nearby, making the area London&#x27;s first theatrical and entertainment district. &quot;When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage&quot; Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started.

Throughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.

Although Burbage&#x27;s son later claimed the Theatre as the first permanent playhouse in the London conurbation, it may not have been the first permanent theatre to serve Londoners. The Newington Butts Theatre may have been built as early as 1575, certainly actor Jerome Savage renewed a lease on the site on 25 March 1576, three weeks before Burbage&#x27;s lease in Shoreditch. Newington Butts was clearly established by Lady Day 1577, and Wickham &quot;et al.&quot; interpret the available documents as saying that Savage was adapting an existing building constructed by Richard Hicks rather than building from scratch.

The design of The Theatre was possibly adapted from the inn-yards that had served as playing spaces for actors and/or bear baiting pits. The building was a polygonal wooden building with three galleries surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a thrust stage. The Theatre is said to have cost £700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.

The open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a penny. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron. Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre&#x27;s appearance, but it has been described as an &quot;amphitheater&quot;.

The Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for Leicester&#x27;s Men, the acting company of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the Admiral&#x27;s Men, of which James Burbage&#x27;s son, Richard was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the Rose Theatre which was under the management of Philip Henslowe.

In 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his early plays had their première at The Theatre. &quot;At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces.&quot; Richard&#x27;s most noted role is—which holds close to his namesake — his part as Richard in Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard III. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage&#x27;s theatres, was used as a winter playhouse.

Towards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property&#x27;s landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby Curtain. The lease had been granted to Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen &quot;stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert.&quot; The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day:
Brayne&#x27;s widow, Margaret Brayne, and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne&#x27;s death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it—in disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed. However, this was not the end as Myles attempted to bring down the Burbages in another two lawsuits, which both ended in failure. &quot;The old disputes of the Theatre were overtaken by the new litigation of the Alleyns-the original owners, when the Burbages dismantled the Theatre and rebuilt it as the Globe.&quot; At the time of Margaret Brayne&#x27;s death there were still lawsuits that had not been settled, and in her last will and testament she left all of her prospective winnings to Robert Myles.

Though Giles Allen was the landlord John Hyde legally owned the lease to the Theatre and would return the lease to Richard and Cuthbert Burbage and Margaret Brayne for the sum of £30. Cuthbert then went to Walter Cope, a trusted business man, and had Cope ask Hyde if Cuthbert could outright pay for the lease and own it himself. Cuthbert paid and outright owned the lease now, ultimately squeezing Margaret Brayne out of the business. They justified this by stating that now that the lease was in Cuthbert&#x27;s name and no longer in James’ name John Brayne had no dealings with the Theatre and therefore neither did Margaret Brayne.

This state of affairs forced the Burbage brothers to take drastic action to save their investment. In defiance of the landlord and with the help of their friend and financial backer William Smith, chief carpenter Peter Street and ten or twelve workmen, they dismantled the theatre on the night of 28 December 1598 and moved the structure piecemeal to Street&#x27;s yard near to Bridewell. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe. Giles Allen then sued Peter Street in January 1599 for trespassing on the property of the Theatre, stating that Street had no right to dismantle the Theatre and move the supplies. He also attempted to sue Cuthbert and Richard Burbage for trespassing.

===Archaeological investigation===
In August 2008, archaeologists from the Museum of London excavating in New Inn Broadway, Shoreditch, announced that they had found the foundation of a polygonal structure they believed to be the remains of the north-eastern corner of The Theatre. The Theatre and Shakespeare&#x27;s involvement with it are commemorated by two plaques on 86–90 Curtain Road, the building at the corner with New Inn Yard currently occupied by a Foxtons office. The remains of the theatre are listed as a scheduled monument.

<doc id="401361" wikidata="Q470853" url="?curid=401361" title="Calandra lark">
<text>The calandra lark (Melanocorypha calandra) or European calandra-lark breeds in warm temperate countries around the Mediterranean and eastwards through Turkey into northern Iran and southern Russia. It is replaced further east by its relative, the bimaculated lark.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The calandra lark was originally placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. The current genus name, &quot;Melanocorypha&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;koruphos&quot; a term used by ancient writers for a now unknown bird, but here confused with &quot;korudos&quot;, &quot;lark&quot;. &quot;Calandra&quot;&#x27; derives ultimately from &quot;kalandros&quot; the Ancient Greek name for this bird. The bimaculated lark is also sometimes termed as the calandra lark.

=== Subspecies ===
Four subspecies are recognized: 
* Western calandra lark (&quot;M. c. calandra&quot;) - : Found in southern Europe and north-western Africa to Turkey (except south-central and south-eastern Turkey), Transcaucasia and north-western Iran
* Eastern calandra lark (&quot;M. c. psammochroa&quot;) - : Found from northern Iraq and northern Iran to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan
* &quot;M. c. gaza&quot; - : Originally described as a subspecies of the bimaculated lark. Found from eastern Syria and south-eastern Turkey to south-western Iran
* Levant calandra lark (&quot;M. c. hebraica&quot;) - : Found from south-central Turkey and north-western Syria to Israel and western Jordan

==Description==
This is a large, robust lark, 17.5–20 cm long. It is an undistinguished-looking species on the ground, mainly streaked greyish brown above and white below, and with large black patches on the breast sides. It has a white supercilium.

In flight it shows short broad wings, which are dark below, and a short white-edged tail. The wing and tail patterns are distinctions from its more easterly relatives.

The song is like a slower version of that of the skylark.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is mainly resident in the west of its range, but Russian populations of this passerine bird are more migratory, moving further south in winter, as far as the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

This is a bird of open cultivation and steppe. Its nest is on the ground, with 4–5 eggs being laid. Food is seeds supplemented with insects in the breeding season. It is gregarious outside the breeding season.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This species occupies open plains, from steppes and pastures to extensive dry cereal cultivations and true steppe with dense grass cover. In the Mediterranean Basin it is mainly found in dry pastures and dry cultivations. In cultivated areas, it prefers fallows, long-fallows and field edges and to a lesser extent sown fields, selecting unirrigated legumes and barley fields. The species is monogamous and lays eggs from early April to July. The nest is made from grass stems and small leaves, lined with softer material and built in a shallow depression on the ground, often under a tussock. Clutches are usually three to six eggs (de Juana and Suárez 2004). Its diet is seasonal, feeding mostly on insects in the summers and seeds and grass shoots in the winter. Mediterranean populations are resident, forming large flocks in the autumn and winter (Snow and Perrins 1998, de Juana and Suárez 2004). Eastern populations are migratory or partially migratory (de Juana and Suárez 2004).

Parasites of the calandra lark include the chewing louse &quot;Ricinus vaderi&quot;, described from specimens collected in Azerbaijan.

==In culture==
The song is considered so musical to human ears that the calandra lark was formerly a popular cagebird in its range. It is mentioned in, for instance, the Tuscan proverb &quot;Canta come una calandra&quot;, he or she sings like a lark, and the Spanish ballad &quot;Romance del prisionero&quot;, where its song is the only way the prisoner knows when day breaks.

<doc id="401362" wikidata="Q2070667" url="?curid=401362" title="John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier">
<text>Field Marshal John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier, (born Jean Louis de Ligonnier; 7 November 168028 April 1770), styled Sir John Ligonier from 1743 to 1757, was a French-born British soldier and politician who fought for the English and British armies for more than half a century. In 1757, he was appointed Commander-in-chief and raised to the peerage as Viscount Ligonier in 1757, and in 1766 further elevated as Earl Ligonier.

Ligonier was a Huguenot refugee who fled his native Castres for England in 1697, following the 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau, which stripped the rights of French Protestants to practice their religion. He joined the British Army in 1702 as a volunteer, and for the next six decades was dedicated to the British cause. He fought in the European wars of the Spanish Succession, of the Quadruple Alliance, and of the Austrian Succession. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, he also served as Master-General of the Ordnance, effectively acting as Minister of War for the Pitt–Newcastle ministry. He retired from active duty in 1763 and died at his home in London on 28 April 1770.

He sat in the House of Commons for Bath from 1748 to 1763 and served as Governor of Guernsey from 1750 to 1752.

==Early life and family==
John Ligonier was born Jean-Louis de Ligonnier in Castres, Languedoc, the second son of Louis de Ligonnier, &quot;sieur&quot; de Montcuquet, and Louise de Ligonnier, daughter of Louis du Poncet. His parents were married 28 March 1677 at Roquecourbe. His grandfather built the family&#x27;s hôtel particulier, , in Castres. Louis de Ligonnier died around 1690.

John, a Huguenot, was educated in France and Switzerland. In 1697, he became the first of Louis&#x27; three younger sons who left for England, where they altered the name to Ligonier.

His younger brother Antoine de Ligonnier followed in 1698. He served in several of the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s campaigns during the War of the Spanish Succession and died unmarried in 1767, with the rank of major. His youngest brother François-Auguste de Ligonnier emigrated in 1710.

Their eldest brother, Abel de Ligonnier (1669-1769), inherited his father&#x27;s estates and stayed in Castres. He married Louise de Boileau, daughter of Jacques de Boileau de Castelnau, sister of Huguenot refugee Charles Boileau, the progenitor of the Boileau family in Britain, many of whom served in the British Army. Abel was recorded living in France as late as 1769.

==Military career==

In 1702, Ligonier volunteered to join a regiment in Flanders commanded by Lord Cutts.
He fought, with distinction, in the War of the Spanish Succession and was one of the first to mount the breach at the siege of Liège in October 1702. After becoming a captain in the 10th Foot on 10 February 1703, he commanded a company at the battles of Schellenberg in July 1704 and Blenheim in August 1704, and was present at Menen where he led the storming of the covered way as well as Ramillies in May 1706, Oudenarde in July 1708 and Malplaquet in September 1709 where he received twenty-three bullets through his clothing yet remained unhurt. In 1712, he became governor of Fort St. Philip, Menorca. During the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1719 he was adjutant-general of the troops employed in the Vigo expedition, where he led the stormers of Pontevedra.

Two years later, he became colonel of the Black Horse. He was made a brigadier general in 1735, major general in 1739, and accompanied Lord Stair in the Rhine Campaign of 1742 to 1743. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 26 February 1742 and George II made him a Knight of the Bath on the field of Dettingen in June 1743. At Fontenoy in May 1745, Ligonier commanded the British, Hanoverian, and Hessian infantry.
During the Jacobite rising of 1745 he was called home to command the British army in the Midlands. In November 1745 he led a column of troops sent to Lancashire to oppose the rebels. Having been promoted to the rank of general of horse on 3 January 1746, he was placed at the head of the British and British-paid contingents of the Allied army in the Low Countries in June 1746.

He was present at Rocoux in October 1746 and, having been made Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance on 19 March 1747, he fought at Lauffeld in July 1747, where he led the charge of the British cavalry. He did this with such vigour that he overthrew the whole line of French cavalry. In this encounter his horse was killed and he was taken prisoner by Louis XV, but was exchanged within a few days. The official despatch reported:

He became Member of Parliament for Bath in March 1748 and colonel of the 2nd Dragoon Guards in 1749. From 1748 to 1770 he was governor of the French Hospital.

On 6 April 1750 he was appointed Governor of Guernsey and on 3 February 1753 he became colonel of the Royal Horse Guards.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
In September 1757, following the disgrace of the Duke of Cumberland who had signed the Convention of Klosterzeven, Ligonier was made Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. He worked closely with the Pitt–Newcastle ministry who sought his strategic advice in connection with the Seven Years&#x27; War which was underway at this time. Ligonier was also made a field marshal on 3 December 1757, Colonel of the 1st Foot Guards on the same date and a peer of Ireland on 10 December 1757 under the title of Viscount Ligonier of Enniskillen. He was notionally given command of British forces in the event of a planned French invasion in 1759 though it never ultimately occurred. He stood down as commander-in-chief in 1759 and became Master-General of the Ordnance. He was given a further Irish peerage on 1 May 1762 as Viscount Ligonier of Clonmell (with remainder to his nephew) and on 19 April 1763 he became a Baron, and on 6 September 1766 an Earl, in the British peerage.

Fort Ligonier, commanded by Lord Ligonier from 1758 to 1766, became the permanent settlement of Ligonier, Pennsylvania and lent its name to Ligonier Valley and Ligonier Valley Railroad. After extensive excavations, Fort Ligonier was reconstructed in 1954 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Retirement==

Ligonier spent his later years at Cobham Park in Cobham, Surrey, which he bought around 1750. He died, still unmarried, on 28 April 1770 and was buried in Cobham Church. There is a monument to him, sculpted by John Francis Moore in Westminster Abbey.

The earldom became extinct but the Irish viscountcy and Cobham Park passed to his nephew Edward (son of his younger brother Francis), who would also be created Earl Ligonier in the Peerage of Ireland six years later.

<text>The Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath), formerly the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), is an independent nonprofit mathematical research institution on the University of California campus in Berkeley, California. It is a mathematical center for collaborative research, drawing thousands of researchers each year.

The institute was founded in 1982, and its funding sources include the National Science Foundation, private foundations, corporations, and more than 90 universities and institutions. The institute is located at 17 Gauss Way on the Berkeley campus, close to Grizzly Peak in the Berkeley Hills.

Given its contribution to the nation&#x27;s scientific potential, the institute is supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency.  Private individuals, foundations, and nearly 100 Academic Sponsor Institutions, including mathematics departments in the United States, also provide support and flexibility. Jim Simons, founder of Renaissance Technologies and a Berkeley alumnus, was a long-time supporter of the institute and served on the board of trustees.

==History ==
The institute was founded in September 1982 by three Berkeley professors: Shiing-Shen Chern, Calvin Moore, and Isadore M. Singer. Shiing-Shen Chern acted as the founding director of the institute and Calvin Moore acted as the founding deputy director.

Originally located in Berkeley&#x27;s extension building at 2223 Fulton Street, the institute moved into its current facility in the Berkeley hills on April 1, 1985. The institute initially paid rent to the university for its &quot;Hill Campus&quot; building, but since August 2000, it has occupied the building free of rent, just one of several contributions by the Berkeley campus.

In May 2022, the institute announced that it received an unrestricted $70 million gift from James and Marilyn Simons and Henry and Marsha Laufer. In honor of the endowment, MSRI was renamed the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute.

== Governance ==
SLMath is governed by a board of trustees consisting of up to 35 elected members and seven ex-officio members: the director of the institute, the deputy director, the Chair of the Committee of Academic Sponsors, the co-Chairs of the Human Resources Advisory Committee and the co-Chairs of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC).

Unlike many mathematical institutes, SLMath has no permanent faculty or members, and its research activities are overseen by its Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), a panel of mathematicians drawn from a variety of different areas of mathematical research. There are ten regular members in the SAC, and each member serves a four-year term and is elected by the board of trustees.

==Research activities==
SLMath hosts some 85 mathematicians and postdoctoral research fellows each semester and holds programs and workshops that draw approximately 2,000 visits by mathematical scientists throughout the year. The visitors come to SLMath to work in an environment that promotes creativity and the effective interchange of ideas and techniques. SLMath features two focused programs each semester, attended by mathematicians and postdocs from the United States and abroad.

SLMath takes advantage of its proximity to the Berkeley faculty and to the scientific talent and resources of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; it also collaborates with organizations across the nation, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Citadel LLC, IBM, and Microsoft Research. The institute&#x27;s forty-eight thousand square foot building has views of the San Francisco Bay. It has been active for 30 years.

== Education programs ==

SLMath also serves a wider community through the development of human scientific capital, providing postdoctoral training to young scientists and increasing the diversity of the research workforce. The institute also advances the education of young people with conferences on issues in mathematics education. Additionally, they host research workshops that are unconnected to the main programs, such as its annual workshop on K-12 mathematics education &quot;Critical Issues in Mathematics Education.&quot;

During the summer, the institute holds workshops for graduate students. It also sponsors programs for middle and high school students and their teachers as part of the Math Circles and Circles for Teachers that meet weekly in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland. It also sponsors the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad (BAMO), the Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival, and the U.S. team of young girls that competes at the China Girls Math Olympiad.

The lectures given at SLMath events are recorded and made available for free on the internet. SLMath has sponsored a number of events that reach out to the non-mathematical public, and its Simons Auditorium also hosts special performances of classical music. Mathematician Robert Osserman has held a series of public &quot;conversations&quot; with artists who have been influenced by mathematics in their work, such as composer Philip Glass, actor and writer Steve Martin, playwright Tom Stoppard, and actor and author Alan Alda. SLMath also collaborates with local playwrights for an annual program of new short mathematics-inspired plays at Monday Night Playground at the Berkeley Repertory Theater, and co-sponsored a series of mathematics-inspired films with UC Berkeley&#x27;s Pacific Film Archive for the institute&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It also created a series of mathematical puzzles that were posted among the advertising placards on San Francisco Muni buses.

==Mathical Book Prize==
The Mathical Award is presented to books &quot;that inspire children of all ages to see math in the world around them.&quot; Recipients of the award include John Rocco, Robie Harris, Jeffrey Kluger, Lauren Child, Michael J. Rosen, Leopoldo Gout, Elisha Cooper, Kate Banks, Gene Luen Yang, Steve Light, and Richard Evan Schwartz.

<text>Gordon Memorial College was an educational institution in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. It was built between 1899 and 1902 as part of Lord Kitchener&#x27;s wide-ranging educational reforms.

Named for General Charles George Gordon of the British army, who was killed during the Mahdi uprising in 1885, it was officially opened on 8 November 1902 by Kitchener himself.

The first students at the school in 1903 were primary school students. In 1905 secondary education courses for future assistant engineers and land surveyors were added, and in 1906 a four-year course for training primary school teachers was started. By 1913 there were about 500 students in the college. In 1924 the college commenced vocational courses for Sharia, Engineering, Teachers&#x27; Training, Clerical Work, Accounting and Science. Post-secondary education courses in Science, Arts, Engineering, Veterinary Science and Law were started in 1938.

There were strong links between courses and Sudan government departments where it was anticipated students would work after graduation. At the beginning of 1945, all these schools were grouped together in a special arrangement with the University of London and secondary education was moved elsewhere. In 1948 there were 262 students at the college.

In 1951, Gordon Memorial College was merged with the Kitchener School of Medicine (founded in 1924) and renamed University College Khartoum with the University of London setting the examinations and awarding the degrees.

In 1956, the University College became the fully independent University of Khartoum. The University of Khartoum claims to be the oldest university in Sudan based on the founding of the Gordon Memorial College in 1902.

The college provided high class education to its students, who were drawn from all backgrounds of Sudanese youth, enabling them to gain the sort of education previously only available in European or American universities.

== Graduates of Memorial College ==
Many of the Sudan&#x27;s Prime Ministers and generals, including Mohamed Ahmed Mahjoob, Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa, Babiker Awadalla and Ibrahim Abood Ahmed, studied there.

Ismail al-Azhari, the first prime minister of Sudan, studied at the Gordon Memorial college but graduated from the American University of Beirut.

Palestinian scholar Ihsan Abbas also began teaching at the College and continued on after it became known as the University of Khartoum.

<text>The Battle of Oriskany ( or ) was a major engagement of the Saratoga campaign during the American Revolutionary War. On August 6, 1777, an American column of Tryon County militia and Oneidas marching to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix was ambushed by a contingent of Britain&#x27;s Indigenous allies and Loyalists. It was one of the few battles of the war in which most non-Indigenous participants were settlers born in the Thirteen Colonies. The Americans suffered heavy casualties during the battle.

Under the command of Brigadier-General Nicholas Herkimer, the American relief column came up the Mohawk Valley and initially consisted of approximately 800 militiamen and between 60 and 100 Oneida warriors. In response to news of the column&#x27;s advance, Brigadier-General Barry St. Leger dispatched a force of roughly 500 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson to intercept them. Most of Johnson&#x27;s force were Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga and Mississaugas warriors led by Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter, and Joseph Brant.

Johnson&#x27;s men successfully ambushed Herkimer&#x27;s column in a small valley about east of Fort Stanwix, near the Oneida village of Oriska. The British victory cost the Americans approximately 465 dead, wounded, or captured, while Johnson&#x27;s force suffered only 93 men killed, wounded or captured. Herkimer was also mortally wounded. The morale of Britain&#x27;s Indigenous allies was damaged when they discovered that an American sortie from Fort Stanwix had looted their camp during the battle. This was a contributing factor in Leger&#x27;s decision to abandon the siege two weeks later.

The battle also marked the beginning of a civil war among the Iroquois, as Oneida warriors under Louis Cook and Han Yerry aligned with the Patriot cause, as did the Tuscarora. As the Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga were allied to the Loyalist cause, this resulted in incidents of armed conflict between the two factions. The battle&#x27;s location is known in Iroquois oral histories as &quot;A Place of Great Sadness&quot;, and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark along with being marked by a monument at the Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site.

== Background ==
In June 1777, the British Army launched a two-pronged attack from Quebec under the command of General John Burgoyne. Burgoyne&#x27;s objective was to split New England from the other colonies by gaining control of New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley. The main thrust came south across Lake Champlain under Burgoyne&#x27;s command; the second thrust was led by St. Leger and was intended to come down the Mohawk Valley and meet Burgoyne&#x27;s army near Albany.

St. Leger&#x27;s expedition consisted of about 1,800 men who were a mix of British regulars, Creuzbourg&#x27;s Jäger Corps, Loyalists from the Royal Yorkers and the British Indian Department, and Indigenous warriors of several tribes, including the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Mohawk, and Mississauga. The main body travelled from Lachine up the Saint Lawrence River and along the shore of Lake Ontario to the Oswego River. At Oswega they were joined by British Indian Department rangers from Fort Niagara under the command of Deputy Superintendent John Butler, and several hundred Indigenous warriors. The expedition ascended the Oswego River and crossed Oneida Lake to reach the Oneida Carry. Fort Stanwix, a Continental Army outpost at the east end of the portage was besieged beginning August 2.

==Prelude==
Tryon County&#x27;s Committee of Safety head Nicholas Herkimer was warned of a possible British attack along the Mohawk River, and he issued a proclamation on July 17 warning of possible military activity and urging the people to respond if needed. Oneida allies warned him on July 30 that the British were just four days from Fort Stanwix, and he put out a call-to-arms. The force raised totaled 800 from the Tryon County militia composed primarily of poorly trained farmers who were chiefly of Palatine German descent. They set out from Fort Dayton on August 4 and camped near the Oneida village of Oriska on August 5. A number of the militia dropped out of the column due to their lack of conditioning, but Herkimer&#x27;s forces were augmented by a company of 60 to 100 Oneida warriors led by Han Yerry, a strong supporter of the Patriot cause. That evening, Herkimer sent three men toward the fort with messages for the fort&#x27;s commander Colonel Peter Gansevoort. Gansevoort was to signal the receipt of the message with three cannon shots and then sortie to meet the approaching column. The couriers, however, had difficulty getting through British lines, and they did not deliver the message until late the next morning, after the battle was already underway.
St. Leger learned on August 5 that Herkimer and his relief expedition were on their way from a message that Molly Brant had sent to her brother Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who led a portion of St. Leger&#x27;s Indigenous contingent. St. Leger sent a detachment of light infantry from Sir John Johnson&#x27;s Royal Yorkers towards Oriska that evening to monitor Herkimer&#x27;s advance, and Brant and Butler followed early the next morning with about 400 Indigenous warriors and Indian Department rangers. Many of the warriors were armed with muskets, however, others carried only tomahawks and spears.

==Battle==
Herkimer held a war council on the morning of August 6. He wanted to wait because he had not heard the expected signal from the fort, but his captains pressed him to continue, accusing him of being a Tory because his brother was serving under St. Leger. He was stung by the accusations and relented, ordering the column to march on toward Stanwix.

About six miles (9.6 km) from the fort, the road dipped more than 50 feet (15 m) into a marshy ravine with a stream at the bottom that was about three feet wide. Seneca chiefs Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter chose this place to set up an ambush; the Royal Yorkers waited behind a nearby rise and the Iroquois concealed themselves on both sides of the ravine. The plan was for the Royal Yorkers to stop the head of the column, after which their Indigenous allies would attack the extended column. At about 10 am, Herkimer&#x27;s column descended into the ravine, crossed the stream, and began ascending the other side with Herkimer on horseback near the front.

Contrary to the plan, the Indigenous warriors lying in wait opened fire prematurely, however, the Patriots were taken completely by surprise. Colonel Ebenezer Cox was leading the 1st Regiment (Canajoharie district), and he was shot off his horse and killed in the first volley. Herkimer turned his horse to see the action and was struck by a ball that shattered his leg and killed the horse. Several of his officers carried him to a beech tree and urged him to retire from further danger. He defiantly replied, &quot;I will face the enemy&quot;, and calmly sat leaning against the tree smoking a pipe and giving directions and words of encouragement to the men nearby.

The trap had been sprung too early, and portions of the column had not yet entered the ravine. Most of these men panicked and fled; some of the attacking warriors pursued them, resulting in a string of dead and wounded that extended for several miles. Between the loss of the column rear and those killed or wounded in the initial volleys, only about one half of Herkimer&#x27;s men were still fighting 30 minutes into the battle. Some of the attackers who were not armed with muskets waited for the flash of an opponent&#x27;s musket fire before rushing to attack with the tomahawk. During the battle, Oneida leader Louis Akiatonharónkwen (Joseph Lewis Cook) shot and killed an enemy warrior whose musket fire was devastatingly accurate, noting that &quot;every time he rises up he kills one of our men&quot;.

Herkimer&#x27;s men eventually rallied, fighting their way out of the ravine to the crest to its west. John Johnson was concerned about the militia&#x27;s tenacity, so he returned to the British camp and requested some reinforcements from St. Leger, returning with 70 men. A thunderstorm caused a one-hour break in the fighting, during which Herkimer regrouped his militia on the higher ground. He instructed his men to fight in pairs; while one man fired and reloaded, the other waited and then only fired if attacked. They were to keep at least one weapon loaded at all times to reduce the effectiveness of the tomahawk attacks.

Butler took time during the thunderstorm to question some of the captives, and thus learned about the three-cannon signal. Reinforcements from the Royal Yorkers arrived, and Butler convinced them to turn their coats inside out to disguise themselves as a relief party coming from the fort. When the fighting resumed, the Royal Yorkers advanced, but the ruse failed when Patriot Captain Jacob Gardinier recognized the face of a Loyalist neighbor. Close combat continued for some time, often hand-to-hand between men who had been neighbors.
===Sortie from Fort Stanwix===
Herkimer&#x27;s messengers reached the fort at around 11 a.m., and Colonel Gansevoort organized the requested sortie. Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willett led 250 men from the fort and raided the nearly deserted enemy camps to the south, driving away the few people left in them (including women) and taking four prisoners along the way. They collected blankets and other personal possessions from the indigenous camps, and they also raided John Johnson&#x27;s camp, taking his letters and other writings.

One of the warriors guarding the camps ran to the battlefield to alert fellow warriors that their camps were being raided. They disengaged with cries of &quot;Oonah, oonah!&quot;, the Seneca signal to retire, and headed for the camps to protect their women and possessions. This forced the smaller number of German and Loyalist combatants to also withdraw.

==Aftermath==
===Patriots===
Herkimer was seriously wounded and many of his officers were killed, and the battered remnant retreated to Fort Dayton. His men carried him from the battlefield and his leg was amputated, but the operation went poorly and he died on August 16. The indigenous warriors retrieved most of their dead by the following day, but many dead and wounded Patriots were left on the field. Benedict Arnold&#x27;s relief column marched through several weeks later, and the men were moved by the stench and grisly scene.
General Philip Schuyler learned of the retreat from Oriskany and immediately organized additional relief to be sent to the area. Arnold&#x27;s relief column arrived at Fort Stanwix on August 21, and he sent messengers into the British camp who convinced the British and indigenous besiegers that his force was much larger than it actually was. They abandoned their siege and withdrew.

===Loyalists===

In September 1777, Butler, a British Indian Department official, was authorized to raise a Loyalist military unit which became known as Butler&#x27;s Rangers. Indian Department rangers who had fought at Oriskany formed the core of this regiment. After the siege was lifted, many of the Loyalist soldiers returned to Fort Niagara or Montreal, while others joined Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign on the Hudson, including numerous warriors from various tribes.

===Iroquois===

Brant and Seneca chief Sayenqueraghta proposed the next day to continue the fighting by pursuing the Patriots downriver toward German Flatts, New York, but St. Leger turned them down. This battle marked the beginning of a war among the tribes in the Iroquois Confederacy, as it was the first time that they had fought against one other. The Mohawks, Senecas, Cayugas, and Onondagas were allied with the British, as were some Oneidas, and the Iroquois in St. Leger&#x27;s camp met in council and decided to send the Patriot-allied Oneidas a bloody hatchet. Brant&#x27;s Mohawks raided and burned the Oneida settlement of Oriska later in the siege. In retaliation, the Oneidas plundered the Mohawk strongholds of Tiononderoge and Canajoharie. They later raided the Fort Hunter Mohawks, prompting most of the remaining Mohawks in central New York to flee to Quebec.

A number of Patriots were taken prisoner by Indigenous warriors during the battle. While many of these captives were turned over to the British, some were tortured and killed. In his account of the battle, Patriot prisoner Dr. Moses Younglove accused the British and Loyalists of aiding and abetting the murders, and claimed &quot;the savages&quot; ate two of the prisoners. Canadian historian Gavin Watt, however, has debunked these claims, describing them as &quot;highly coloured&quot; as well as being &quot;extremely suspect.&quot;

===Assessment===
The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war, based on the percentage of casualties suffered. About half of Herkimer&#x27;s force were killed or wounded, as were about 15 percent of the Loyalist force. The battle may be considered a success for St. Leger because he stopped the Patriot relief column. However, the remnants of the Patriot force remained present on the battlefield after the withdrawal of the Loyalist force when news spread of the sortie against the indigenous camps. News of the Sortie may have averted the complete destruction of Herkimer&#x27;s force.

The British success was tempered by discontent of their indigenous allies after the battle. When they joined the expedition, they expected British forces would do most of the fighting. However, they were the dominant fighters in this action, and some suffered the loss of their personal belongings taken during the Patriot sortie from the fort. This blow to their morale contributed to the eventual failure of St. Leger&#x27;s expedition.

==Legacy==
In an interview many years afterwards, Governor Blacksnake recalled how he &quot;thought at that time the Blood Shed a Stream running down on the ground.&quot; The battle&#x27;s location is known in Iroquois oral histories as &quot;A Place of Great Sadness.&quot;

A monument was erected in 1883 to commemorate the battle at 43° 10.6′N 75° 22.2′W, and much of the battlefield is now preserved in the Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site. The site was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The town of Herkimer, New York and Herkimer County, New York were named in Herkimer&#x27;s honor. The battle was honored by the name of aircraft carrier , launched in 1945, now an artificial reef, and also by the issuance of a postage stamp in 1977.

<text>The deputy secretary of state of the United States is the principal deputy to the secretary of state. If the secretary of state resigns or dies, the deputy secretary of state becomes acting secretary of state until the president nominates and the Senate confirms a replacement. The position was created in 1972. Prior to July 13, 1972, the under secretary of state had been the second ranking officer of the Department of State. 

The State Department is the only federal cabinet-level agency to have two co-equal deputy secretaries. The second deputy secretary of state, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, serves as the &quot;first assistant&quot; for the purposes of the Vacancies Reform Act, but both deputy secretaries have full delegated authority to act for the secretary, if not otherwise prohibited by law.

Certain deputy secretaries of state went on to become appointed as the secretary of state, such as Lawrence Eagleburger in 1992, Warren Christopher in 1993, and Antony Blinken in 2021.

<text>Martian Chess is an abstract strategy game for two or four players invented by Andrew Looney in 1999. It is played with Icehouse pyramids on a chessboard. To play with a number of players other than two or four, a non-Euclidean surface can be tiled to produce a board of the required size, allowing up to six players.

In his review in &quot;Abstract Games Magazine&quot;, Kerry Handscomb stated: The first thing to note about Martian Chess is that it is not a chess-type game at all. Instead, the objective is to accumulate points by capturing pieces. Martian Chess is [...] an original game with novel tactics and strategy. 

In 1996, Looney had invented Monochrome Chess, a similar two-player game that uses regular chess pieces where the half of the board determined who controlled a piece. While the king is not royal, the king and rook can castle.

== History ==
Martian Chess was one of four games in the released by Looney Labs in 1999. The set was Looney Labs&#x27;s first Icehouse release and first to showcase its potential as a game system. The other three games were IceTowers, IceTraders and Zarcana. In 2001, Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 2000&quot;. The rules to the game were reissued in &quot;3HOUSE&quot; booklet in 2007, again by 2013 in Pyramid Primer No. 1 and in 2016 as a part of &quot;Pyramid Arcade&quot; boxed set.

== Rules ==
=== Initial setup ===
Each player starts with nine pieces: three small (&quot;pawns&quot;), three medium (&quot;drones&quot;), and three large (&quot;queens&quot;). The color of the pieces is irrelevant to the gameplay. A mix of colors is recommended.

Players initially place their pieces in the corners of the board as shown. In a two-player game, only a half-board is used. The players decide who moves first. Play turns alternate, and pass to the left after each move.

=== Movement and capturing ===
The red lines in the diagrams indicate notional &quot;canals&quot; which divide the board into &quot;territories&quot;, or quadrant. At any given time a player controls only those pieces that are in his or her territory.

The pieces move as follows:
* &quot;Pawns:&quot; one space diagonally in any direction. (Unlike chess pawns, they may move backwards.)
* &quot;Drones:&quot; one or two spaces horizontally or vertically, without jumping. (Like chess rooks, but with limited range.) 
* &quot;Queens:&quot; any distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, without jumping. (The same as chess queens.)

As in chess, a square may contain no more than one piece, and a piece is captured when an enemy piece lands on the square it occupies. The capturing player removes the piece and puts it aside for later scoring.

In the two-player game, a player may not immediately reverse an opponent&#x27;s last move (i.e. may not move the piece across the canal back to its departure square, on the next turn).

=== End of game and scoring ===
The game ends when one player runs out of pieces (i.e., their territory becomes empty). Players then compute their scores by adding up the point values of the pieces they captured: queen = 3, drone = 2, pawn = 1. The player or team with the highest total wins the game.

In the four-player game, the players form two teams, with teammates in opposite corners. Teammates play for a combined score. Aside from strategic differences, play is unaffected; it is legal (and sometimes good strategy) to capture your teammate&#x27;s pieces.

== Strategy ==
Capturing with a queen often allows the opponent to immediately recapture, leading to a back-and-forth battle until one player runs out of pieces in the line(s) of capture. This is more common in two-player games, since other players may interfere in the four-player version. The net point difference is usually minor with two players, but can give the players involved a significant lead over the others in a four-player game.

Moving a pawn or drone into enemy territory can be a good move for several reasons, it can:
* prevent an opponent from capturing the piece from you
* ensure the availability of a piece to capture from an opponent
* block an attack from an enemy queen or drone

<doc id="401385" wikidata="Q333565" url="?curid=401385" title="John Manners, Marquess of Granby">
<text>Lieutenant-General John Manners, Marquess of Granby (2 January 1721 – 18 October 1770) was a British Army officer and politician. The eldest son of John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland, as he did not outlive his father and inherit the dukedom, Manners was known by his father&#x27;s subsidiary title, Marquess of Granby. He served in the military during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and the Seven Years&#x27; War, being subsequently rewarded with the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. Manners was popular with the troops who served under him and many British pubs are still named after him today.

==Early life==

John Manners was born in Kelham, Nottinghamshire on 2 January 1721. He was the eldest son of John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland and his wife, Lady Bridget Manners (née Sutton). Manners was educated at Eton College, graduating from there in 1732 before attending Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1738. In 1740, Manners travelled through Europe as part of the Grand Tour, visiting Italy and the Ottoman Empire before returning in 1742.

==Political career==

In 1741, he was elected as member of parliament for the pocket borough of Grantham. Though the municipality was a market town, its electorate was relatively small and the affairs of Grantham&#x27;s council was during the Georgian era sponsored alternately by the Manners, Cust, Thorold and Heathcote families whose family seats were all nearby.

==Military career==
=== The Jacobite rising ===
In 1745, Manners assisted his father in establishing up a volunteer regiment in Rutland to assist in suppressing the Jacobite rising of 1745. Although the regiment was limited to garrison duty at Newcastle upon Tyne, it was the only one of its type that raised the full quota of 780 recruits. Manners received a commission as colonel of the regiment. Even though the regiment was never moved northwards beyond Newcastle, the young Marquess of Granby went to the front as a volunteer on the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s field staff and saw active service in the last stages of the insurrection, being present at the Battle of Culloden. In Newcastle the regiment mutinied because they had not been paid but Granby paid the money owed out of his own pocket before they were due to be disbanded. Thereafter he left England for Flanders as Intelligence Officer to Cumberland.

=== Military positions ===
In 1752, the Government suggested to George II that Granby be appointed colonel of the prestigious Royal Horse Guards (Blues), in order to secure the parliamentary support of his family. The king initially refused to make the appointment. In the meantime, Granby advanced his parliamentary career, and was returned for Cambridgeshire in 1754.

The king came to view him more favourably as he defended the Newcastle ministry in the House of Commons. He was promoted major-general on 18 March 1755, and was at last made Colonel of the Blues on 27 May 1758. On 21 August, Granby arrived at Munster as second in command to Lord George Sackville, as the aged Duke of Marlborough had recently died. The British cavalry were divided into Heavy and Light cavalry and drilled under the strong influence of George Elliot and Granby himself. Accredited as the greatest colonel since the Earl of Oxford, Granby was both courageous and competent as a soldier. He was then appointed overall commander of the expedition, replacing Sackville on 21 August 1759. He became Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance on 15 September 1759.

He was one of the first who understood the importance of welfare and morale for the troops. The character of British soldiering improved and, properly led, the army was unbeatable in war. Nearly all the portraits show him mounting a horse or helping the wounded. On 7 June 1760 he wrote to Viscount Barrington, Secretary at War, receiving a reply ten days later making enquiries as to the Hospital Board accommodation for his wounded men.

=== Seven Years’ War ===
Granby was sent to Paderborn in command of a cavalry brigade. While leading a charge at the Battle of Warburg, he is said to &quot;have lost his hat and wig, forcing him to salute his commander without them&quot;. This incident is commemorated by the British Army tradition that non-commissioned officers and troopers of the Blues and Royals are the only soldiers of the British Army who may salute without wearing headdress. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1759 and later that year fought at the Battle of Minden as commander of the second line of cavalry under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

Granby&#x27;s success in commanding the allied cavalry required courage, control and communication, as well as skill in bringing the horse artillery to bear. The victory at the Battle of Warburg in July 1760 over an army three times the size distinguished his generalship, and marked him as a genuine British military hero. His opponent, the duc de Broglie, was so impressed that he commissioned a portrait of Granby by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Further successes came at the Battle of Emsdorf in July 1760, the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761 and at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762.

==Political offices==
Granby returned to England as a hero: a painting by Edward Penny, &quot;The Marquess of Granby Relieving a Sick Soldier&quot;, showed him acting as a man of charity rather than as a soldier and this assured his appeal to the people. An interesting anecdote from 1824 also alludes to his generosity shown towards soldier’s wives:

He sought to steer a path independent of party politics but supported the Treaty of Paris. He trusted George Grenville who promptly appointed him Master-General of the Ordnance under his ministry on 14 May 1763. Granby was also made Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire on 21 February 1764.

=== Master-General of the Ordnance ===
Granby supported the government&#x27;s issue of general warrants and prosecution of Wilkes, but in 1765 spoke against the dismissal of army officers for voting against the government in Parliament. In May 1765, Lord Halifax attempted to persuade George III to appoint Granby Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, in the hopes that his popularity would help quell the riot of the London silk weavers. The king refused, having promised the reversion of the post to the Duke of Cumberland, but obtained Granby&#x27;s retention as Master-General of the Ordnance in the new Rockingham ministry, although Granby did not co-operate with the ministry and voted against the repeal of the Stamp Act.

Under the Chatham Ministry, Granby was appointed commander-in-chief on 13 August 1766. Despite rumours of his retirement, he vigorously electioneered during the 1768 season, and increased the Rutland interests seats to seven, at some expense. With the resignation of Chatham, he found himself somewhat isolated in the Grafton Ministry. While he had opposed the attempts of the government to expel Wilkes from his seat in Middlesex, his personal dislike of Wilkes overcame his principles, and he voted in favor of the expulsion on 3 February 1769 and for the seating of Henry Luttrell afterwards. It was to prove a serious political mistake. Junius, a political writer, attacked the ministry accusing Granby of servility towards the court and personal corruption. Granby&#x27;s great popularity might have let him ride out the affair, but his reversal on Wilkes provided new ammunition. Worse still, a reply to Junius by his friend Sir William Draper, intended in his defence, essentially validated the charge that the hard-drinking and personable Granby was easily imposed upon by less scrupulous acquaintances.

=== Resignation ===
Ultimately, it was not the attacks of Junius, but the return of Chatham that brought about his departure from politics. Granby had always respected Chatham, and through the mediation of John Calcraft, was eventually persuaded to break with the ministry. On 9 January 1770, he announced that he had reversed himself once more on the propriety of expelling Wilkes, and shortly thereafter resigned as commander-in-chief and Master-General of the Ordnance, retaining only the colonelcy of the Blues.
Once out of office, Granby found himself hard-pressed by his creditors, and the loss of his official salaries had weakened his financial position. In the summer of 1770, he unsuccessfully campaigned for George Cockburne at the Scarborough by-election.

==Death==

Granby died in Scarborough, North Yorkshire on 18 October 1770. The outpouring of grief was real and sustained. His friend and associate Levett Blackborne, a Lincoln&#x27;s Inn barrister and Manners family adviser who frequently resided at Belvoir, was away at the time, visiting a family relation of Manners&#x27; and received the disturbing news on his return to Belvoir. He wrote to George Vernon at Clontarf on 12 February 1771, bemoaning Granby&#x27;s proclivities that had brought him to ruin:

&quot;You are no stranger to the spirit of procrastination. The noblest mind that ever existed, the amiable man whom we lament was not free from it. This temper plunged him into difficulties, debts and distresses; and I have lived to see the first heir of a subject in the Kingdom have a miserable shifting life, attended by a levee of duns, and at last die broken-hearted.&quot;

He is probably best known today for being popularly supposed to have more pubs named after him than any other person — due, it is said, to his practice of setting up old soldiers of his regiment as publicans when they were too old to serve any longer. By 1761, at forty years of age, he had already won the title of &quot;the Father of the British Army.&quot;

==Family==
He had two illegitimate children by a mistress Anne Mompesson:
*George Manners (1747–1772)
*Anne Manners (1750-1822) married John Manners-Sutton, her first cousin

Five months after the birth of his illegitimate daughter Anne in Lincoln he married Lady Frances Seymour (1728–1761), daughter of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset and Lady Charlotte Finch (1693–1773), daughter of 7th Earl of Winchilsea, on 3 September 1750. According to Horace Walpole, &quot;She has above a hundred and thirty thousand pounds. The Duke of Rutland will take none of it, but gives at present six thousand a-year.&quot; They had six children:
*John Manners, Lord Roos (29 August 1751 –2 June 1760, London)
*Lady Frances Manners (1753 –15 October 1792)
*Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland (1754 –1787)
*Lady Catherine Manners, died young
*Lord Robert Manners (1758 –1782)
*Lady Caroline Manners, died young

<text>The bimaculated lark (Melanocorypha bimaculata) breeds in warm temperate countries eastwards from Turkey into Central Asia. It is the eastern counterpart of its relative, the calandra lark.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The bimaculated lark was originally placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. The current genus name, &quot;Melanocorypha&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;koruphos&quot; a term used by ancient writers for a now unknown bird, but here confused with &quot;korudos&quot;, &quot;lark&quot;. &quot;Bimaculate&quot; and the specific &quot;bimaculata&quot; are from Neo-Latin &quot;bimaculatus&quot;, &quot;two-spotted&quot;. The alternate name calandra lark should not be confused with the species of the same name. The alternate name Eastern calandra lark is also used for a subspecies of the calandra lark.

==Description==
This is a large, robust lark, 16–18 cm in length. It is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly streaked grey above and white below, and with two small black patches on the breast sides, which give this species its name. It has a white supercilium.

In flight it shows short broad wings, which are grey-brown below, and a short tail with a white tip, but not white edges. The wing and tail patterns are distinctions from its more westerly relative.

The song is like a harder version of that of calandra lark.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bimaculated lark is found from west-central Turkey to southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, north-eastern Iran and northern Afghanistan. It is also found in northern Israel, Lebanon, western Syria and northern Iraq. It is mainly migratory, wintering in northeast Africa, and ranges widely throughout the greater Middle East to Pakistan, India and Tibet. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

This is a bird of stony semi-desert and higher altitude cultivation. Its nest is on the ground, with 3-4 eggs being laid. Food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season. It is gregarious in winter.

<doc id="401398" wikidata="Q7761357" url="?curid=401398" title="The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood">
<text>The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood, a report submitted to the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome in 1971, by Dr Conrad Baars, a Dutch-born Catholic psychiatrist from Minnesota, and based on a study of 1500 priests, suggested that seminary training left priests poorly prepared for a lifetime of celibacy.

==Description==
This report was published by Franciscan Herald Press in 1972 as How to Treat and Prevent the Crisis in the Priesthood. It was also expected to be published in 2006 by St. Paul&#x27;s/Alba House as part of a book of essays on the priesthood and religious life.

#&quot;psychosexual immaturity expressed in heterosexual or homosexual activity was encountered often. Virtually all of these priests were ... suffering from a severe to moderate frustration neurosis”.
#Less than 15% of priests in Europe and North America were emotionally fully developed;
#Of the remaining 85%, 20–25% had &quot;serious psychiatric difficulties&quot; that they expressed through alcohol abuse, while 60–70% had less severe degrees of emotional immaturity.

Though the report suggested that immediate corrective action was needed, making ten recommendations, and one of those most active in the Synod was Cardinal Wojtyła, who on October 16, 1978, was elected Pope John Paul II, no implementation of the report&#x27;s detailed recommendations followed.

<text>Google Shopping, formerly Google Product Search, Google Products and Froogle, is a Google service created by Craig Nevill-Manning which allows users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different vendors. Google announced at its Marketing Live event in May 2019 that the new Google Shopping will integrate the existing Google Express marketplace into a revamped shopping experience. In the US, Google Shopping is accessible from the web and mobile apps, available on Android and iOS. Google Shopping is also available in France, accessible from the web only. Like its predecessor, Google Shopping is free and requires a personal Google account in order to purchase from the platform. A colored price tag icon replaces the parachute icon from Google Express.

== Features ==
On the web, shoppers can either go to the Google Search homepage to enter a search query and then select the Shopping tab under the navigation bar, or go directly to the Google Shopping site to search for specific items, browse departments, and see trending items and promotional offers. The Google Shopping mobile app opens directly to the shopping homepage, where shoppers can similarly search or browse, and access their shopping lists, order history and notification settings. Currently, the product inventory available on the app is less robust than what is available on the web, since it currently reflects items shoppers can only buy directly on Google. In addition to shopping from well-known online stores, users can shop with confidence at lesser-known online stores when they choose to buy directly on Google, which includes a Google-backed guarantee. The guarantee includes Google customer support, available 7 days a week, and added assistance if the order is late, if something is wrong with the shipment, and to simplify the return and refund process - regardless of the seller. When on the web, shoppers can identify products they can buy on Google by either looking for the colored cart icon within a product image, or by selecting the Buy on Google filter. Free delivery is available on qualifying orders that meet the store&#x27;s minimum order amount.

Shoppers can see personalized product recommendations and promotional offers on the Google Shopping homepage depending on their Google account settings. Other features geared to help shoppers find the best prices and places to buy include the ability to track the price of a product, compare the total order cost at online or nearby stores, and access product reviews and related video content.

Over the coming year, additional shopping capabilities will be rolled-out and tied into other Google products and platforms in order to simplify a shopper&#x27;s buying journey.

==History==

=== Froogle (2002 – 2008) ===
Created by Craig Nevill-Manning and launched in December 2002, Froogle was different from most other price comparison services in that it used Google&#x27;s web crawler to index product data from the websites of vendors instead of using paid submissions. As with Google Search, Froogle was instead monetized using Google&#x27;s AdWords keyword advertising platform.

=== Google Product Search (2008 – 2013) ===
With its 2008 re-branding as Google Product Search, the service was modified to emphasize integration with Google Search; listings from the service could now appear alongside web search results.

Google prominently featured the service result in Google Search starting in January 2008 in Germany and the United Kingdom. It subsequently extended the practice to France in October 2010, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain in May 2011, the Czech Republic in February 2013 and Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden in November 2013.

Originally, the service listed prices submitted by merchants, and was monetized through AdWords advertising like other Google services. However, in May 2012, Google announced that the service (which was also immediately renamed Google Shopping) would shift in late-2012 to a paid model where merchants would have to pay the company in order to list their products on the service.

=== Google Shopping (2013 – present) ===
Alongside the announcement of an immediate re-brand to Google Shopping on May 31, 2012, Google also announced that in late 2012, it would change the service to use a &quot;pay-to-play&quot; model, where merchants would have to pay Google to list their products on the service, with results influenced by both relevance and the bid amounts they pay. Google justified the move by stating that it would allow the service to &quot;deliver the best answers for people searching for products and help connect merchants with the right customers.&quot;

The change proved controversial; some small businesses showed concern that they would not be able to compete with larger companies that can afford a larger advertising budget. Microsoft&#x27;s Bing also attacked the move in an advertising campaign known as &quot;Scroogled,&quot; which called Google out for using &quot;deceptive advertising practices&quot; and suggesting that users use its competing Bing Shopping service instead.

Google also revealed plans to integrate Google Catalogs with Google Shopping, to give users &quot;more ways to find ideas and inspiration as you shop and engage with your favorite brand.&quot;

In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record €2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.

In March 2018, Google introduced Shopping Actions, a commission based model, where customers can shop &quot;on the Google Assistant and Search with a universal cart, whether they&#x27;re on mobile, desktop, or even a Google Home device&quot;

Initial case studies on the impact of Shopping Actions vs Google Shopping alone show positive results, with higher Average Order Value, increase in basket size, and higher revenue to merchants.

==Naming==

Google Shopping was originally known as Froogle, a pun on the term &quot;frugal.&quot; On April 18, 2007, the product was renamed Google Product Search; the original name was dropped due to concerns surrounding internationalization, people not understanding the pun or understanding what the service was actually about, and concerns related to the company&#x27;s trademark infringement lawsuit against competing website Froogles. On May 31, 2012, the product was renamed to Google Shopping. The URL &quot;froogle.com&quot; remains as a redirect to Google Shopping&#x27;s website.

== Antitrust fine ==
On June 27, 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, fined Google €2.4 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. Google was found to have abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantages to another Google product, its own comparison shopping service.

According to the European Commission, Google started giving its own Froogle significantly better treatment than rivals as early as 2008. It first began in Germany and the United Kingdom, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, then the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden. A total 418 million citizens of the European Economic Area are claimed to have been deprived of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation.

In 2021, the General Court upheld the fine and an appeal is pending .

==Countries==

Google Shopping is currently available in 121 countries and territories:

<text>The black lark (Melanocorypha yeltoniensis) is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae found in south-eastern Russia and Kazakhstan.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The black lark was originally placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. The current genus name is from Ancient Greek. &quot;Melanocorypha&quot; is from &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;koruphos&quot; a term used by ancient writers for a now unknown bird, but here confused with &quot;korudos&quot;, &quot;lark&quot;. The specific &quot;yeltoniensis&quot; is from Lake Yelton in the Volgograd region of Russia.

==Description==
This is a large, robust lark, in length. The adult male is unmistakable, being all black with some pale feather fringes on its back, and with a yellowish or pink bill. The female is undistinguished in comparison, mainly dark-blotched grey above and paler below. Her legs and underwing are black.

The song is like a frantic version of that of Eurasian skylark.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a bird of open steppe, often near water. It is partially migratory, with birds from the northwest of its breeding range moving south-east to winter further into Russia and neighbouring countries, as far as the northern Black Sea coasts in southern Ukraine.

The black lark is a very rare vagrant away from its breeding range, with records during both spring and autumn passage periods, and also in winter; the following is a complete list of European records away from the breeding range and normal wintering range as of 2005.

* 2003 Great Britain. (Wales) A male at RSPB South Stack, Anglesey from 1 to 8 June

An individual was also recorded on an unknown date (prior to 2003) in Lebanon.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Its nest is on the ground, with 4–5 eggs being laid. Food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season. It is gregarious in winter.

<doc id="401407" wikidata="Q78521" url="?curid=401407" title="Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf">
<text>Franz Xaver Josef Conrad von Hötzendorf (after 1919 Franz Conrad; 11 November 1852 – 25 August 1925), sometimes anglicised as Hoetzendorf, was an Austrian general who played a central role in World War I. He served as &quot;K.u.k. Feldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) and Chief of the General Staff of the military of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy from 1906 to 1917. He was in charge during the July Crisis of 1914 that caused World War I.

For years he had repeatedly called for preemptive war against Serbia to rescue the multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was, he believed, nearing disintegration. Later on, he came to believe that the Dual Monarchy had taken action at the eleventh hour. The army was also unprepared and he had resorted to politics to further his goals. He was unaware that Germany would relocate the majority of its forces to the Eastern Front, rather than in the Balkans.

Conrad was anxious about invading Russia and when the Tsar&#x27;s armies had captured the Carpathian mountain passes and were on the verge of invading Hungary, Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Austro-Germans cleared Galicia and Poland during the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in the summer of 1915 and later conquered Serbia in October with the help of Bulgaria. From 1915 his troops were increasingly reliant on German support and command. Without support from its German allies the Austro-Hungarian Army was an exhausted force.

In March 1917, Charles I dismissed him as Chief of Staff after Emperor Franz Joseph died and Conrad&#x27;s Trentino Offensive had failed to achieve its objective; he then commanded an army group on the Italian Front until he retired in the summer of 1918. He died in 1925.

==Life==
Conrad was born in Penzing, a suburb of Vienna, to an Austrian officers&#x27; family. His great-grandfather Franz Anton Conrad (1738–1827) had been ennobled and added to his name the nobiliary particle &quot;von Hötzendorf&quot; as a predicate in 1815, referring to the surname of his first wife who descended from the Bavarian Upper Palatinate region. His father Franz Xaver Conrad (1793–1878) was a retired colonel of Hussars, originally from southern Moravia, who had fought in the Battle of Leipzig and took part in the suppression of the Vienna Uprising of 1848, wherein he was severely wounded.

Conrad married Wilhelmine le Beau (1860–1905) in 1886, with whom he had four sons. 

In the latter part of his life, he was known to hold doubts about his fitness for office (like his German counterpart, von Moltke the Younger) and occasionally suffered severe bouts of depression. These worsened after the death of his wife in 1905. In 1907, while attending a dinner party in Vienna, Conrad met and quickly became enamoured of Virginia von Reininghaus, an Italian aristocrat. In the weeks following this, he made many attempts to court Reininghaus, despite the fact that she was already married and with six children, which eventually resulted in the two conducting an affair. This illegitimate pairing continued until their marriage in 1915.

Upon his death in 1925, a journal titled &quot;Diary of my Sufferings&quot; was found. The journal compiled over 3,000 letters written to Reininghaus, some over 60 pages in length, detailing the extent of Conrad&#x27;s love for her. In order to prevent a scandal breaking out from a potential leak, Conrad kept the letters private and they were never sent to their intended recipient.

===Military career===
Conrad joined the cadet corps of the Hainburg garrison and was educated at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He developed a strong interest in natural science, especially in Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. In 1871, at age 19, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in a Jäger battalion. After graduating from the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot; military academy in 1876, he was transferred to the General Staff Corps of the Austro-Hungarian Army.

In 1878–1879, upon the Treaty of Berlin, these duties brought him to the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sanjak of Novi Pazar, when those Ottoman provinces were assigned to the military administration of Austria-Hungary. He was
a Captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;) and served as a staff officer during the 1882 insurrection in the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia. In 1886, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 11th Infantry Division at Lemberg, where he showed great ability in reforming field exercise. In the fall of 1888, Conrad was promoted to major and appointed professor of military tactics in the &quot;Kriegsschule&quot; in Vienna, a position he prepared for by touring the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War. Conrad proved to be a good teacher who was quite popular among his students.

===Return to command and Chief of Staff===

In 1892 he requested transfer back to command and took charge of the 93rd Infantry Regiment at Olomouc. From 1895 he commanded the 1st Infantry Regiment &quot;Kaiser&quot; at Kraków and from 1899 the 55th Infantry Brigade in Trieste, promoted to a Generalmajor. After acting against a major Italian uprising in the city in 1902, he was made &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; and took command of the 8th Infantry Division at Innsbruck in 1903.

By the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff for the Austro-Hungarian military forces at the suggestion of the heir to the throne (&quot;Thronfolger&quot;), Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in November 1906, Conrad had established a reputation as a teacher and writer. Like other Austro-Hungarian officers of his generation, he had little or no direct combat experience, but had studied and written extensively about theory and tactics. His published works on infantry tactics sold well and were printed in multiple editions. He was a tireless campaigner for modernization of the armed forces. He was made &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; in November 1908.

Strategically, he took the opposite approach to his countryman Carl von Clausewitz. Where Clausewitz had described war as &quot;policy ... carried on with other means&quot;, Conrad, seeing conflict as always inevitable, viewed the role of politicians and diplomats as solely to create favorable conditions for successful military endeavors. &quot;The fate of nations, peoples, dynasties&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is decided not at diplomatic conferences but on the battlefield.&quot;

Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria conferred the noble rank of a Freiherr on Conrad in 1910. Conrad&#x27;s differences with Foreign Minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal, who objected several times to Conrad&#x27;s suggestion of a preventive war with Italy, ultimately led to Conrad&#x27;s dismissal as Chief of Staff in 1911, partly under the pretext of objection to Conrad&#x27;s affair with von Reininghaus, whom he later married. After Aehrenthal resigned and died the next year, Archduke Franz Ferdinand urged Conrad&#x27;s re-appointment, which took place during the Balkan Wars in December 1912.

Although Conrad&#x27;s ideas had considerable impact in the decision making process of the government, especially in the lead-up to the First World War, historian John Leslie describes him as a &quot;loner&quot; who did not easily win friends or influence people and was politically inept. In the wake of the Balkan Wars, he regularly took the initiative to urge war on the government, often without provocation from the putative enemy or regard for the readiness of Austrian troops, believing that Serbian independence had led to a &quot;foul peace&quot; that the empire needed to correct if it was to have any chance to survive in the long term.

Conrad was a Social Darwinist, and believed life consisted of &quot;an unremitting struggle for existence&quot; in which the offensive was the only effective form of defence. The power of the Magyar elite within Austria-Hungary troubled him, as he believed it weakened and diluted what he saw as an essentially German-Austrian empire. He worried about Italian ambitions in the Balkans. His greatest ambition was for a pre-emptive war against Serbia in order to neutralize the threat that he believed they posed, and at the same time change the political balance within the Dual Monarchy against the Magyars by incorporating more Slavs in a third Yugoslavian component under Austrian control, denying the principle of self-determination. According to Hew Strachan, &quot;Conrad von Hötzendorf first proposed preventive war against Serbia in 1906, and he did so again in 1908–09, in 1912–13, in October 1913, and May 1914: between 1 January 1913 and 1 January 1914 he proposed a Serbian war twenty-five times&quot;.
===First World War===

====Planning====
Conrad and his admirers took special pride in his elaborate war plans that were designed individually against various possible opponents, but did not take into account having to fight a two-front war against Russia and Serbia simultaneously. His plans were kept secret from his own diplomatic and political leadership — he promised his secret operations would bring quick victory. Conrad assumed far more soldiers than were available, with much better training than they actually had. In practice, his soldiers were inferior to the enemy&#x27;s. His plans were based on railroad timetables from the 1870s, and ignored German warnings that Russia had much improved its own railroad capabilities. He additionally disregarded von Moltke&#x27;s regular exhortations to focus on Russia as the most pressing threat and set aside his emotional plans for war on Italy and Serbia. 

In addition, Conrad&#x27;s preparations for war fell far short of what was needed. In the kind of large continental war in which Austria would likely fight Serbia or other European powers, close cooperation and coordination with its closest ally, Germany, was essential. Yet Conrad and his German counterpart, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, held few meetings and were only able to agree that in that situation Germany would concentrate on fighting France while Austria-Hungary focused on Russia. As a result, when World War I did break out, the two allies both came to expect more from each other while delivering less than promised. Conrad also failed to restructure the Austro-Hungarian Army from one designed mainly to maintain domestic political balance into one that could fight the kind of wars he wished to. Despite being aware that his troops were insufficiently trained for those wars, as pre-war Austria spent the least on its military and the least time training its soldiers of any major European nation of the era, he never attempted to rectify that situation.

Conrad assumed the war would result in victory in six weeks. He assumed it would take Russia 30 days to mobilize its troops, and he assumed his own armies could be operational against Serbia in two weeks. When the war started, there were repeated delays, made worse when Conrad radically changed plans in the middle of mobilization. Russia did much better than expected, mobilizing two thirds of its army within 18 days, and operating 362 trains a day – compared to 153 trains a day by Austria-Hungary.

During the July Crisis upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Conrad was the first proponent of war against the Kingdom of Serbia in response. Germany is thought to have requested an immediate invasion of Serbia, but Conrad delayed for over a month. Many Army units were on leave to harvest crops and not scheduled to return until 25 July. To cancel those leaves would disrupt the harvest and the nation&#x27;s food supply, scramble complex railroad schedules, alert Europe to Vienna&#x27;s plans, and give the opposition time to mobilize. Meanwhile, Emperor Franz Joseph went on his long-scheduled three week summer vacation.

====Victories and defeats====

On 12 August 1914, Conrad sent an army of 460,000 men into Serbia where it suffered a humiliating defeat within months to Radomir Putnik&#x27;s outnumbered Serb forces, drawing on what they had learned during the Balkan Wars. 

Conrad&#x27;s failure to plan for simultaneous wars with Serbia and Russia led to considerable resources being expended moving his &quot;B-Staffel&quot; swing force to the former front where, after ten days of inactivity, they were redeployed to the Russian front. Instead of taking up positions at the expected front line in Galicia after getting off the train, Conrad ordered all units except cavalry to detrain short of the lines and march the rest of the way. By the time they reached the front ten days later, the remaining troops were exhausted.

On 22 August he launched an even larger campaign against Russia through Galicia, after early victories at Kraśnik and Komarów which were followed by defeat and the loss of Lemberg. Conrad unexpectedly had to deal with a massive incursion of Imperial Russian troops into Austrian Galicia. His plans had underestimated Russian strength and speed, while ignoring the glaring weaknesses in his own army. His forces did win a great victory at Limanowa, in December 1914, saving Kraków.

However, during the later months of the year, Conrad applied much of the army&#x27;s efforts to breaking the Siege of Przemyśl, briefly retaking the fortress there in October. Later he ordered poorly prepared troops to attack via the shortest route, through the passes of the Carpathian Mountains, which offered many defensive possibilities for Russian troops as well as winter weather to contend with. In April 1915 the fort finally surrendered. By then many of Austria&#x27;s nearly one million casualties had come from efforts to relieve Przemyśl, an objective that had lost of most of its strategic importance as the siege wore on. Late in 1914 Conrad said privately that if Franz Ferdinand were still alive he would have had him shot for his poor performance, even as Conrad publicly blamed others for his failures.

After the Germans scored major victories especially at Tannenberg, and after the Western front was bogged down in stalemate, Germany had resources to help Austria. Although Conrad was officially in command, the German forces alongside him increasingly took control of the situation. Berlin sent in large armies and together they conquered large parts of Serbia, Montenegro and Romania and stabilised the Italian front. 

He urged the new Foreign Minister Stephan Burián von Rajecz to annex the occupied lands, and he continuously intrigued against the Hungarian prime minister István Tisza as well as against the Austrian minister president Count Karl von Stürgkh, whom he considered a fool, though to no avail. In addition, relations with the German Supreme Army Command (OHL) worsened due to the uneasy relationship between Conrad and General Erich von Falkenhayn, who replaced von Moltke after his death.

====Italian campaigns and retirement====
Following the accession of Emperor Charles I of Austria to the throne in November 1916, Conrad was elevated to the rank of field marshal, one of only three men in Austria-Hungary to hold that rank at the time. While still the heir-apparent, Charles had reported to Emperor Franz Josef that the &quot;mismanagement&quot; in the army&#x27;s high command could not be cleared out until Conrad was replaced, but admitted that finding someone to take his role would not be easy. Yet under the new emperor, Conrad&#x27;s powers were gradually eroded. In December, the commander-in-chief Archduke Friedrich of Austria-Teschen was removed from office, which the new emperor assumed himself. Charles took operational control of all combat units in the army and navy and on 1 March 1917 officially dismissed Conrad, who then requested retirement. The emperor personally asked him to remain on active duty, and when Conrad accepted, he was placed in command of the South Tyrolean Army Group. 

In that command, determined to punish &quot;perfidious&quot; Italy, he repeated many of the same mistakes and oversights that had characterized his leadership on the Eastern Front. The Central Powers&#x27; greatest success, the Caporetto came after the Germans largely took over and marginalized Conrad.

In the late spring of 1918, Conrad launched his last offensive, which became the Second Battle of the Piave River. He begged Vienna for additional troops as he had far fewer infantrymen and cavalrymen than needed. Those reinforcements were available, but deliberately denied by Conrad&#x27;s superiors. He launched the offensive anyway, which resulted in 45,000 new casualties and no gains. The casualties, combined with an increase in the desertion rate afterwards, effectively ended the Austro-Hungarian Army as a fighting force for what remained of the war. 

The costly and bloody assaults led by both Conrad and Boroević brought condemnation upon the imperial leadership. Further complicating Conrad&#x27;s image was his identification with those in the government intent on continuing the war. In this atmosphere, Conrad, described as a &quot;broken man&quot;, was dismissed on 15 July, perhaps in an effort to deflect further criticism. At the same time he was promoted from Freiherr to the noble rank of a &quot;Graf&quot; (count) and received the honorific post of a Guard colonel.

===Death===
After the war, Conrad denied any personal guilt for the outbreak and the results of the war and blamed the Imperial court and politicians for it. Embittered and sickened, he died on 25 August 1925, while taking a cure in Mergentheim, Germany.

When he was buried at Hietzing Cemetery in Vienna on 2 September 1925, more than 100,000 mourners participated in observances. After long discussion, his &quot;grave of honor&quot; () was redesignated a &quot;historical grave&quot; in 2012.

Ennobled as &quot;Freiherr&quot;, usually translated as Baron, in 1910 and made a &quot;Graf&quot;, usually translated as count, in 1918, Conrad became simply Franz Conrad-Hötzendorf in April 1919, when the First Austrian Republic abolished nobility for its citizens.

==Strategies and performance==

Conrad&#x27;s legacy as a commander remains controversial, with earlier historians regarding him as a military genius, while more recent works characterize him as an utter failure. One mid-20th-century military historian considered him to be &quot;probably the best strategist of the war.&quot; Taking the opposing view, early 21st-century U.S. Air Force Academy historians Mark Grotelueschen and Derek Varble focused primarily on Conrad&#x27;s failure to plan for a two-front war with both Russia and Serbia in devoting their contribution to the 2022 anthology &quot;The Worst Military Leaders in History&quot;. &quot;In a conflict notorious for failed generalship&quot;, they write, &quot;[Conrad] repeatedly demonstrated that he was the worst of a bad lot.&quot; His expertise was almost exclusively in tactical matters, and when it came to strategy, &quot;was no match for the position.&quot;

In military matters, Conrad emphasized the importance of aggressive, well-trained infantry and the strategic and tactical offensive. Historian Gunther E. Rothenberg argued that his unrealistically grandiose plans disregarded the realities of terrain and climate, and that the plans which he drew up frequently underestimated the power of the enemy and the potential of quick-firing artillery forces. He also based his plans on outdated information, such as the 1870 rail schedules he used to estimate Russia&#x27;s ability to mobilize, disregarding frequent warnings from von Moltke that the country had greatly improved its capabilities since then. This led him to believe that following a swift victory over Serbia, Austrian forces would be able to pivot to Galicia before the Russians could arrive on the front in great numbers.

Conrad refused to take responsibility for the start of the war, or for Austria-Hungary&#x27;s defeat, arguing that he had &quot;been &#x27;just a military expert&#x27; with no voice in the key decisions&quot;. Later historians found that the record contradicted this assertion, with Conrad having incessantly urged war on the government well before the July Crisis began. During that time Leopold Berchtold, the Empire&#x27;s Foreign Minister, described Conrad&#x27;s position as &quot;Krieg, Krieg, Krieg&quot;. As early as 1925 Austrian Social Democrat Otto Bauer said that Conrad was one of the five or six men in all of Europe who bore primary responsibility for the war. &quot;Conrad not only wanted war,&quot; wrote Grotelueschen and Varble a century later, &quot;he was practically &quot;desperate&quot; for it.&quot; His role in agitating for war was so great that Grotelueschen and Varble suggest that Austria, rather than Germany as commonly believed, was the more belligerent party.

To his admirers he was a military genius. Soviet general and theorist Boris Shaposhnikov presented Conrad as a model for a good Chief of the General Staff in his 1927 book &quot;Mozg Armii&quot;. The historian Cyril Falls, in his 1959 book &quot;The Great War&quot;, argues that Conrad was probably the best strategist of the war and that his plans were brilliant in conception. He argues that German generals in the east based most of their successful offensive operations on Conrad&#x27;s plans. German general Paul von Hindenburg praised Conrad as a man of superior ability and a bold general, only hindered by the weaknesses of his army. However, the earlier scholarship that attributed the success of the 1915 Gorlice–Tarnów offensive in part to Conrad&#x27;s planning has been supplanted by later examinations of the documentation that show those plans to have been largely drawn up by von Falkenhayn, who minimized Conrad&#x27;s involvement as much as he could.

Conrad&#x27;s critics contend that his mistakes led to the disastrous first year of war that crippled Austro-Hungarian military capabilities. For example, in the 1914 Serbian Campaign, led by General Oskar Potiorek, the Serbian Army proved far more effective than Conrad had expected despite the Austro-Hungarian manpower advantage. Undefeated in all major battles, it enforced a full-scale retreat of Conrad&#x27;s troops by the end of the year. The first Austro-Hungarian offensives against Russia were remarkable for their lack of effect, culminating in the losses at Galicia and Przemyśl combined with massive human cost. 

Conrad was fully responsible for this disaster, for he had committed too many troops in Serbia, leaving severely outnumbered units to resist the Russian advance. Conrad blamed the German allies, who had driven out the Russian Army from East Prussia in the Battle of Tannenberg, for the lack of military support. He steadfastly refused to accept blame for any failures, throughout the war, always faulting either allies or his own subordinates for failing him. This excuse was belied by the Germans winning victories over the same opposing forces at the same time and on the same terrain, with similar dispositions of forces. What success Conrad&#x27;s troops enjoyed later in the war came either due to more serious Russian errors, or with substantial German support.

==Legacy==
In the years after the war, he was revered, largely as a symbol of lost imperial glory, by other former officers. After his death in 1925, his second wife and former mistress similarly burnished and defended his reptuation. For decades, the reputation of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Conrad as one of the greatest military commanders in modern history was a matter of national pride among patriotic circles in post-war Austria—though his policies and tactics had already been criticized by contemporaries like Karl Kraus, who in his satirical drama &quot;The Last Days of Mankind&quot; portrayed him as a vain poser (I 2). Not until the 1960s, in the course of the renewed controversy over the causes of World War I, did the evaluation of his role shift from hagiography towards a widespread perception as a warmonger and imperialist. The massive casualties his forces took through wave attacks rather than any tactical or strategic acumen has given him a reputation of being a callous and incompetent commander.

Conrad&#x27;s guard uniform and some of his personal belongings are on display at the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, Vienna. In 1938 the Wehrmacht barracks of the 1st Mountain Division in Oberammergau, Bavaria were named &quot;Conrad-von-Hötzendorf-Kaserne&quot;; it is today operated by the Bundeswehr and site of the NATO School. The medical service centre of the Austrian Armed Forces in Innsbruck is named after Field Marshal Conrad. In the Austrian cities of Graz and Berndorf streets were named &quot;Conrad-von-Hötzendorf-Straße&quot;.

<text>Esade (Escola Superior d&#x27;Administració i Direcció d&#x27;Empreses) is an international private educational institution based in Barcelona, Spain. Esade runs two schools of the university, Esade Business School and Esade Law School, as well as a language centre, the Esade Executive Language Center. The school has also formed a strategic alliance with Ramon Llull University in its undergraduate programmes in Law and Business. ESADE is ranked among the world&#x27;s top business schools and law school programs by the Financial Times, The Economist, Forbes, QS World University Rankings and more.

== History ==

The Esade project was conceived in the spring of 1954 by a group of Spanish professionals and entrepreneurs who later founded the university. The school signed an agreement with the Jesuits (Societas Iesu) in October 1958 and started offering its first academic programs in a small building in the district of Sant Gervasi, Barcelona.

In 1958, Esade was ultimately founded. Two years later, in 1960, executive education programmes were introduced. In 1964 the college&#x27;s MBA programme was established. A year later, in 1965, ESADE&#x27;s Barcelona campus (Av. Pedralbes) opened (Building I), as well as the Executive Language Centre. In 1993, Esade Law School opened. In 2001, the school inaugurated its campus in Madrid (Chamartín). In 2009 Esade opened a new campus in Sant Cugat (Barcelona) as well as Esade Creapolis, a technology park based on open innovation and situated on the new Sant Cugat campus.

Today Esade&#x27;s campuses, if the premises in both Madrid and Barcelona are included, cover an area of 30,000m2.

==Esade Creapolis==

Esade Creapolis is a joint venture between Esade, a consortium of Spanish financial institutions, local government institutions and business associations. The organisation manages a technology and innovation park on the Esade campus in Sant Cugat, Barcelona. It is an open innovation centre promoted by Esade business school, where companies, students, the academic community and scientists come together intending to promote both creativity and innovation. Between 2005 and 2008 Esade Creapolis invested €70 Million in its facilities in Sant Cugat and has since become home to various startups.

<doc id="401419" wikidata="Q2356445" url="?curid=401419" title="Moorgate">
<text>Moorgate was one of the City of London, England&#x27;s northern gates in its defensive wall, the last to be built. The gate took its name from the Moorfields, an area of marshy land that lay immediately north of the wall.

The gate was demolished in 1762, but gave its name to a major street, &quot;Moorgate&quot;, laid out in 1834. The area around the street and around Moorgate station is informally also referred to as &quot;Moorgate&quot;. The Moorgate district is home to many financial institutions and has many notable historic and contemporary buildings.

Moorgate station was the site of the Moorgate tube crash of 1975, when a Northern City Line train failed to stop and hit a brick wall killing 43. This resulted in systems, known as Moorgate control, being installed on the Underground in order to stop trains at dead-ends.

==The gate==
The earliest descriptions of Moorgate date from the early 15th century, where it was described as only a postern in the London city wall. Located between Bishopsgate and Cripplegate and leading to a marshy open space known as Moorfields, it was not one of the larger or more important of the city gates.

In 1415 an ordinance enacted that the old postern be demolished. It was replaced with a newer and larger structure located farther to the west, which included a wooden gate to be shut at night. This gate was enlarged again in 1472 and 1511, and then damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Although the City gates had ceased to have any modern function apart from decoration, it was replaced along with Ludgate, Newgate, and Temple Bar with a stone gate in 1672.
Moorgate and the Wall originally formed the northern boundary of Coleman Street Ward. It appears that the area outside, the once very marshy Lower and Little Moorfields (now mostly occupied by Finsbury Circus and the surrounding buildings), previously part of the Manor of Finsbury were added in the 17th century, though it was not developed until 1817.

Moorgate was demolished with most of the other London city wall gates in 1761/2, and the resulting stone was sold for £166 to the City of London Corporation to support the starlings of the newly widened centre arch of the London Bridge.

Little Moorgate was a postern opposite Little Winchester Street leading into Moorfields. It had been demolished by 1755, but gave its name to a street that was later removed for the building of a railway.

==Moorgate Street and locality==
The area around the former gate, Moorgate Street and Moorgate station is referred to informally as the &quot;Moorgate&quot; area. This locale roughly approximates to the Coleman Street Ward of the City of London.

The contemporary street of Moorgate runs north from Princes Street and Lothbury at the back of the Bank of England, across the road named London Wall and the location of the old gate, and then continues north. After leaving the City of London in the direction of the London Borough of Islington, the street is known as Finsbury Pavement (which at one time was known as Moor Fields Pavement) and then City Road. The street was constructed around 1846 as one of the new approaches to London Bridge. While the street was formally known as &quot;Moorgate Street&quot;, the street part of the name eventually fell out of use.

The Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall, on Moorgate Place, is the home of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

The Guildhall is connected to Moorgate station via Bassishaw Highwalk. The Guildhall is the home of the City of London Corporation and the centre of City government since the Middle Ages. Adjacent and internally connected to the Guildhall is the Guildhall Art Gallery, which houses the art collection of the City of London. It occupies a stone building in a semi-Gothic style which was completed in 1999 to replace an earlier building destroyed in 1941.

The Moorfields were an extensive area of open land, partly in the City of London, partly in the Manor of Finsbury. The Lower Moorfields was home to the Bethlem Royal Hospital (also known as Bedlam, Europe&#x27;s oldest psychiatric hospital) from 1676 to 1815.
The Lower Moorfields was developed in 1817, with the building of Finsbury Circus. Finsbury Circus includes a number of classical buildings surrounding an oval-shaped circus. The gardens in the centre of the circus occupy a plot enclosed by railings, and include the lawn of the City of London Bowls Club.

Moorgate is also the birthplace of John Keats, one of the principal poets in the English Romantic movement. Keats was born in 1795 in the Swan and Hoop Inn at 199 Moorgate, where his father was an ostler. The pub is now called &quot;The John Keats at The Globe&quot;, having previously been known as &quot;The Moorgate Coffee House&quot;, &quot;The Moorgate&quot; and &quot;The John Keats at Moorgate&quot;, only a few yards from Moorgate station.

A new commercial development on Moorgate, known as Moor House, opened in 2005. The building is located at the corner of Moorgate and London Wall, and was designed by Foster and Partners. The building has of office space in 19 storeys, and is built in the location of a smaller office building built in the 1960s known as Moor House. A 36 m shaft under the building incorporates part of Crossrail&#x27;s new station and ticket hall serving Liverpool Street.

During the 1940s-60s, HM Customs and Excise investigation staff were based at Moorgate Hall, 153 Moorgate.

There is a campus of the London Metropolitan University, formerly a polytechnic, and part of the London Guildhall University, on Moorgate. The campus houses its business school, a library, and other administrative facilities.

A number of large buildings are being planned or already built in the neighbouring streets. These include a 43-storey, 140 m residential skyscraper at Milton Court (The Heron), that is taller than CityPoint, and a 90 m office tower at Ropemaker Place is also being developed by British Land, with construction already underway.

<text>Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (; abbreviated MOL) is a Japanese transport company headquartered in Toranomon, Minato, Tokyo, Japan. It is one of the largest shipping companies in the world.

MOL fleet includes dry cargo ships (bulk carriers), liquefied natural gas carriers, Ro-Ro Car Carrier ships, oil tankers, container ships (among which mv MOL Triumph is the 4th largest containership in the world), and container terminals. Its alligator logo can still be seen on containers in ports, roads, rails and barges around the world, despite the company&#x27;s focus on containers shipping having been reduced since April 2018.

Founded as a key part of the Mitsui &quot;zaibatsu&quot; (family-owned conglomerate) during the early industrialization of Japan, the company is now independent of the zaibatsu, but remains part of the Mitsui &quot;keiretsu&quot; (group of aligned companies).

Despite the international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, MOL has maintained its involvement in Russian energy projects. The company has signed long-term charter contracts with Russian operators, including the controversial Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, now under Russian state control. MOL has also faced challenges in delivering tankers for the Arctic LNG 2 project due to tougher sanctions but continues to engage in negotiations to modify contracts. These actions have drawn criticism for indirectly supporting Russia’s economy during its aggression against Ukraine, raising ethical questions about corporate responsibility and compliance with global efforts to isolate Russia economically.


==History==
MOL (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines) was launched in 1964, following the merger of created in 1878, and Mitsui Steamship Co., Ltd. founded in 1942, formerly known as Mitsui Line, under the Law Concerning the Reconstruction and Reorganization of the Shipping Industry. At that time the company was the largest shipping company in Japan, capitalized at ¥13.1 billion, with 83 vessels aggregating .

===1884–1950===

====OSK====
OSK was founded in 1884, when 55 ship owners, each of whom had only a small number of vessels, combined their operations. The chief representative of these ship owners was Hirose Saihei, senior manager of the Sumitomo zaibatsu, or conglomerate, and a prominent figure in Osaka financial circles. OSK was capitalized at ¥1.2 million, with 93 vessels totalling .
In the first few years its routes were limited to coastal services in the western area of Japan. In 1890, OSK inaugurated an Osaka-Pusan run followed in 1893 by the operation of an Osaka-Incheon route and Korean coastal services. The company was recapitalized at ¥1.8 million in 1893, rising to ¥2.5 million in 1894, to ¥5 million in 1896, when the government of Taiwan granted OSK subsidies for Osaka-Taiwan liner services, and to ¥10 million in 1898 when the company started to operate on the Yangtze River.

In 1898, Tokugoro Nakahashi became the company&#x27;s third president. He made a great effort to rationalize the internal organization of OSK, to penetrate the Chinese market, and also to inaugurate the first OSK ocean route, a Hong Kong to Tacoma, Washington service, in 1908. In 1911 OSK started a Kobe to Bombay service. The route was under the monopoly of the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC) of which Nippon Yusen K.K. (NYK) was the only Japanese member. OSK fought against the FEFC and was admitted to the conference in 1913. In 1918, the company opened a Bombay to Marseilles route and was admitted to full membership of the FEFC. Meanwhile, it opened a San Francisco route, an Australia route, and a South America route, offering a worldwide liner service. It began a New York City service in 1920 but operated at a deficit. In 1930 OSK made a huge investment in five new high-speed motor ships in order to start a New York express service. This service entirely transformed raw-silk transportation from Asia to America; raw silk began to be carried by water all the way to New York instead of going by land. OSK&#x27;s share of cargo shipped on this route grew, and its business performance improved in spite of unfavourable business conditions.
During the Great Depression, OSK and NYK made a cooperative agreement in 1931 whereby OSK abolished its Puget Sound route, which had called at Tacoma and Seattle, and in turn acquired a monopoly on the South American east coast route. OSK quickly recovered from the deficits of 1930 and 1931, and resumed paying dividends in 1932.

The company&#x27;s profits peaked in 1941, when OSK was capitalized at ¥87 million and had 112 vessels aggregating .

====Mitsui Bussan Kaisha====
The Mitsui Line was originally the shipping department of the trading company Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. Mitsui Bussan was established in 1876 and obtained exclusive rights to export and market the coal mined at the state-run Miike mines. It chartered boats and transported coal on its own account. In 1878 it bought a steamship, and in 1888 it bought the mines. Mitsui Bussan became an industrial carrier and the shipping section was established in 1898. The section expanded to become the Shipping Department and moved to Kobe in 1904. The company then owned 9 ships aggregating , and on the eve of World War I the fleet totalled 15 ships with , increasing to 30 ships totalling in 1919. The third general manager, Teijiro Kawamura, expanded the business of the department during World War I; in 1914 it began a tramp service carrying the company&#x27;s own cargo and that of other companies. In 1917 it constructed a shipyard and set up the shipbuilding department and in 1920 it opened a semi-liner service from Dalian via Kobe to Seattle, whereby a liner service operated on outbound voyages but on the return voyage, owing to insufficient cargo at Seattle, ships had to stop and collect cargo at other ports.

Mitsui Bussan&#x27;s Shipping Department built two sister ships in 1924. One was equipped with reciprocal oil-burners, the other had diesel engines and was the first ocean-going diesel ship in Japan. The department put these ships on the North American route and compared their performance. &quot;Akagisan Maru&quot;, the diesel ship, proved superior, and Mitsui concluded a manufacturing and marketing license agreement with Burmeister and Wain Co. (B &amp; W), who had manufactured the engine, in 1926. In 1928 Mitsui opened a Bangkok route, in 1931 a Philippines route, in 1932 a Dalien to New York route, and in 1935 a Persian Gulf route. From 1933 the Shipping Department became known as Mitsui Line. In 1937 it owned 35 ships aggregating . The shipbuilding department was separated off as the Mitsui Tama Shipyard in 1937, and in 1942 the former Shipping Department too became a separate company, Mitsui Steamship Co., Ltd. (MS). It was capitalized at ¥50 million, and Takaharu Mitsui was elected chairman.

====World War II====
During World War II OSK, like other Japanese shipping companies, was forced to be a mere ship owner. When the war ended it had only 55 vessels left, totalling , most of which were so-called wartime standard ships, of poor quality. All ships were under control of the Allied powers through the Civilian Merchant Marine Committee. In 1950, however, OSK returned to global service. By the end of 1957 the company had almost recovered the sailing rights it had been given by the FEFC before the war, and was making 18 voyages per month on 13 overseas liner routes. Competition was far more intense than before the war, as anyone who had money could construct ships under the government-sponsored shipbuilding program, started in 1947. Before the war, conference members had sought to exclude newcomers. OSK constructed 38 ships under the program. In 1953 OSK established an eastbound route to South America to transport emigrants from Japan. At first the service was profitable, but the number of emigrants fell to below 2,000 per year in 1962. In 1963 OSK established the Japan Emigration Ship Co., Ltd. (JES) to hive off this loss making business. Later, JES was reorganized into Mitsui OSK Passenger Co., Ltd. In this period most of OSK&#x27;s businesses were loss making. In 1964 it owned 41 vessels totalling . The company was capitalized at ¥7.6 billion and its debts totalled approximately ¥34.9 billion.

===1950–1964===
During World War II, and after the war, all MS ships were under the control of the government. When Japan lost the war in 1945, only 17 of MS&#x27;s vessels were left, increasing to 22 vessels totalling when MS re-acquired operations that had previously been chartered out to the Civilian Merchant Marine Committee (CMMC).

====Post-war====
MS then began a vigorous expansion of its fleet and routes to re-establish its pre-war network, and went so far as to apply to the FEFC. When its application was rejected, MS placed outsider—non-conference-member—ships on this route in 1953. After a long struggle, the conference attempted to resolve the issue politically and the British ambassador openly criticized Japan&#x27;s shipping policies in 1955. Japan joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) the same year, and Japan&#x27;s minister of transport was anxious to settle the issue without dispute. The final proposal of the conference, through the mediation of the minister of transport, contained extremely harsh conditions which MS had to accept, one of which was that MS could only join the FEFC if it operated under the management of NYK for several years. The 39-month battle was over, and MS began placing ships under the auspice of NYK in 1956. Five years later, MS at last joined the conference.

====Shipbuilding====
MS constructed 38 vessels between 1950 and its merger with OSK in 1964, and its operating tonnage was the largest in Japan. One of its ships, &quot;Kinkasan Maru&quot;, was the first bridge-controlled ship in the world. MS planned to rationalize its crews and at the same time improve the working conditions of engineers. It cooperated with Mitsui Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co., a direct successor of Mitsui Tama Shipyard, and designed innovatory bridge-controlled ships. The &quot;Kinkasan Maru&quot; was delivered in 1961 and MS placed it, along with another bridge-controlled ship, on the New York route, which was re-opened in 1951. Besides the New York route, MS operated westbound and eastbound routes around the world, a Central and South America route, a West Africa route, and a Great Lakes route. In 1964 MS owned 45 vessels aggregating . However, MS&#x27;s performance was disappointing from 1950 until the OSK merger in 1964, when it was capitalized at ¥5.5 billion and had debts of ¥26.7 billion.

==Mitsui-OSK merger==

Soon after the shipping industry reorganization of 1964, in which Japanese shipping companies were restructured into six groups, world shipping moved toward containerization. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL), formed by the merger of OSK and MS, began container services on the California route, joining a space-charter consortium of four Japanese operators.

Business results improved after the merger, and the loss brought forward was written off in 1966. The company was recapitalized at ¥20 billion in 1968, and at ¥30 billion in 1972. The owned fleet increased to 152 vessels, totalling in 1974, and the operating fleet—owned vessels and time-chartered vessels—numbered 291 vessels, totalling .

===Containerization===
The first container ship, MOL&#x27;s &quot;America Maru&quot;, sailed from Kobe to San Francisco in October 1969. Containerization spread to other routes, including the Australia route, with NYK and Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co., in 1970; the North Pacific route, with five other Japanese companies, in 1971; and the Europe route, as part of the TRIO Group consisting of MOL, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Overseas Container Line, Ben Line, and Hapag-Lloyd, in 1971. On the New York route and Mediterranean routes a container service began in 1972. In June 2013, one of its container ship, &quot;MOL Comfort&quot;, broke in two and sank off Yemen. The bow section caught fire before sinking. All 26 crew reported rescued by three other container ships that diverted to her, Hapag-Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Yantian Express&quot;, &quot;Hanjin Beijing&quot; of now defunct Hanjin Shipping and ZIM&#x27;s &quot;ZIM India&quot;. The crews of three ships found them in two raft and one lifeboat.

===Carrying ore===
The other trend was toward specialization. Both OSK and MS had ore carriers, and after the merger MOL held the largest share of the Japanese ore market. The &quot;Yachiyosan Maru&quot;, at , built in 1970 under a cargo guarantee from Nippon Steel Corporation, was the largest ore carrier in Japan at that time.

===Cars===
MOL built &quot;Oppama Maru&quot;, the first Car Carrier ship in Japan in 1965, under cargo guarantee from Nissan Motor Company. MOL could not carry cars at a low freight rate because it had to stick to the conference rate. Nissan therefore established the Nissan Motor Car Carrier Co. in 1970 to operate &quot;Oppama Maru&quot; and transport its cars. Based on this model, MOL and Honda Motor Co. established the Act Maritime Co. in 1973 to carry Honda cars to the United States.

MOL Ro-Ro Car Carrier division is named ACE (Auto Car Carrier Express), and majority of the Roll-on/roll-off vessels in the company fleet have the suffix &quot;Ace&quot; in their names.
The division specializes in maritime transport and distribution of brand new and used automobiles, trucks, trailers, Mafi roll trailers, heavy construction machineries and further types of rolling freight.

Since 1990, MOL has invested in the regional feeder line Euro Marine Logistics.

In July 2006, MOL-operated suffered one of the worst stability accident in the industry. In that occasion, despite all her cargo was a total loss, the ship was salvaged and still sails.

On 1 January 2019, MV &quot;Sincerity Ace&quot; caught fire when sailing northwest of Oahu, en route from Japan to Honolulu port.
Several vessels sailing close by were diverted by the US Coast Guard to rescue her crew, however 4 fatalities and 1 missing person were reported.

On 17 February 2022, &quot;Felicity Ace&quot; caught fire close to Azores islands, en route from Emden to Davisville in US. The ship was fully loaded with Porsche and Volkswagen cars. After sending a distress signal, the 22 crew members were airlifted, while a Portuguese navy ship and four cargo vessels went to rescue, waiting for salvage tugs to arrive. The ship sank on 2 March while under tow.

===Oil crisis===
The U.S. gold embargo in 1971 and the advent of a floating world monetary system was a severe blow for MOL. It changed its financial strategy, keeping more funds in U.S. dollars and in other currencies. More serious was the 1973 oil crisis. MOL immediately cancelled tankers under construction and recorded its best business performance since the merger; freight revenue topped ¥327.5 billion. Soon afterward, however, results deteriorated rapidly and the downslide continued until 1978.

MOL made great efforts to curtail costs, and simultaneously increased the size and number of container ships. Containerization increased on routes between industrially advanced and developing countries, and huge investment was needed to finance this expansion. The development of intermodal transportation on the North America route also began, and MOL introduced a Mini Land Bridge (MLB) service in 1972, using rail transport as well as shipping to reduce transit time, to compete with the U.S. shipping company Sea-Land, extending the service to IPI (Interior Point Intermodal) service in 1980.

Around the time that the MLB service started, the world trade structure began to change and in 1979 about 60% of general cargo from Asia to the United States came to be loaded at newly industrialized countries (NICs). MOL reorganized its routes, changing its starting ports for U.S. voyages from Japan to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other NICs, while shipping companies in the newly industrialized countries captured this new demand and branched out into the Pacific routes. The competition in sea transportation increased and MOL began a direct container service between the Far East and the west coast of North America in 1982. MOL invested huge capital to consolidate these services and to establish a service network in the United States.

As a countermeasure against rising oil costs MOL built energy-efficient ships, cooperating with Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding. &quot;Awobasan Maru&quot;, delivered in 1981, was the first ship incorporating innovations that reduced fuel consumption by 30%. In 1974 MOL established the Saudi Arabian Shipping Co., Ltd. (SASCO) and Arabian Marine Operation Co. Ltd. (AMOCO) as joint ventures with the prince of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. SASCO is the shipowner, while AMOCO manages tanker operations. MOL hoped that this joint venture would give it an advantageous status in any future nationalization of oil, but at first the performance of these companies was not good, and AMOCO acquired the rights to bunker supply in 1977. Two years later the second oil crisis occurred and MOL was able to get a stable bunker supply.

===Scaling back===

Personnel expenses increased after the first oil crisis, and the yen was revalued. These changes hit MOL heavily as a large part of its income was in U.S. dollars. To make itself more competitive, MOL reduced the number of its own vessels and increased the number of flag of convenience (FOC) ships; its own ships fell in number from 127 in 1975 to 82 in 1982, and the number of employees at sea from 3,127 to 2,233, while freight revenue increased from ¥282 billion to ¥476 billion over the same period. MOL also built highly rationalized ships in cooperation with MES, which would require a crew of only 18, the minimum number accepted by the Seamen&#x27;s Act, while other ships required 22 or 24. The first super-advanced ship was the &quot;Canberra Maru&quot;, delivered in 1979, which was put on the Australia route.

===Passenger service===
In 1970 MOL established Mitsui OSK Passenger Co., Ltd. (MOP), with the reorganization of JES. MOP has three passenger ships. The company was the only one in Japan to operate an ocean-going passenger service at that time, but later in the 1990s a few Japanese shipping companies entered this market to cope with the boom in travelling by sea.

===LNG===
In 1983 the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on Free on Board (FOB) conditions began as part of the diversification of Japan&#x27;s energy resources, and MOL, NYK, Kawasaki Steamship, Chubu Electric Power Company, Incorporated and other Japanese electricity and gas companies jointly established two specialized companies, Badak LNG Transport Inc. and Arun, to transport LNG from Indonesia. These two companies operated seven LNG ships, constructed by MOL and other shipping companies. MOL also took delivery in 1983 of the &quot;Kohzan Maru&quot;, Japan&#x27;s first large-sized methanol carrier, and transported methanol from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan&#x27;s exports of industrial plant grew at that time and modularization began. MOL was interested in the transportation of massive plants and took delivery of five specialized ships, including the &quot;Atlas Maru&quot;, equipped with a 600-ton capacity derrick, one of the largest in the world. Plant exports began to decline in the late 1980s and these special ships were mostly sold or changed their flags.

==Restructuring==
In 1984 the Maritime Act of the United States was revised and the mandatory independent action clause was introduced. This gave shipping companies the right to introduce a discount tariff if registered at the Federal Maritime Commission. The conferences on North American routes became extremely weak and freight rates on the routes dropped sharply. Every route between the Far East and the United States made losses and MOL&#x27;s business performance deteriorated again. Once more, MOL worked hard to curtail expenses and establish greater competitiveness on these routes. In the same year it decided to enlarge its container terminal facilities at Los Angeles, and also installed its own container terminals at Asian ports, including Kaohsiung.

MOL also made great efforts to reorganize operations on the Pacific routes, dissolving the consortium of six Japanese companies. In 1985 it began a two-company consortium with Kawasaki Steamship&#x27;s K Line service (KL) on the Japan/Pacific southwest route, and with East Asiatic Co. (EAC) on the Far East/Pacific southwest route. It also decided to start a three-company consortium with KL and EAC on the Pacific northwest route. On each route it began a weekly service with newly built large container ships. The first such ship, &quot;Asian Venture&quot;, was an FOC ship at 1,960 20 feet equivalent unit (TEU), indicating the number of containers loaded, and the main ships placed on this route became FOC ships after they were launched in 1984. Moreover, MOL began operating a double stack train service between Los Angeles, Chicago, and Columbus, Ohio in 1985 and extended it to New York in the following year.

The New York route became the most competitive because of this trend toward intermodal forms of transport. NYK, Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co.--later merged with Japan Line to establish Nippon Liner Systems for liner business and Navix Lines for tramp business—and MOL began a joint operation service in 1986 and put on it six high-speed large vessels including MOL&#x27;s Alligator series ships. To improve services, MOL introduced a computer booking system in 1984 and enlarged its online system to cover the United States and the Far East in 1986. This route, however, became lossmaking after 1986, seriously affecting the company&#x27;s performance; MOL did not pay dividends between 1987 and 1989.

===New ship orders===
In 2015 MOL announced its intention to order six new container ships that will be capable of carrying 20,150 20-foot containers. Other shipping groups have announced similar orders for ships of similar size, but when completed these ships will be among the largest container ships in the world. Four ships are to be constructed at Samsung Heavy Industries shipyards in Korea and a further two will be constructed by Imabari Shipbuilding in Japan. The six vessels are set to be launched starting in 2017 and will serve routes between Asia and Europe.

===2018 container activities merge===

On Monday 31 October 2016, Mitsui OSK Lines, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha agreed to merge their container shipping business via establishing a completely new joint venture company. The integration included their overseas terminal activities.

On 25 July 2020, MOL-operated MV &quot;Wakashio&quot; ran aground and spilled oil at the south of Mauritius.

===MOL blue bonds===
On December 18, 2023, Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) announced its plan to become the first shipping company in Japan to issue &quot;blue bonds&quot; in a public offering, aiming to raise JPY10 billion ($70.3 million) for environmental initiatives over five years. These bonds, which have received the highest rating from the Japan Credit Rating Agency, are part of MOL&#x27;s &quot;Blue Action 2035&quot; strategy, focusing on marine and global environmental conservation with an investment of $4.5 billion (JPY650 billion) from FY2023 to FY2025.

===2022 &quot;Mikage&quot; autonomous voyage and docking===
In August 2022, MV &quot;Mikage&quot; successfully completed the first crewless sea voyage and docking of an autonomous coastal container ship, sailing 161-nautical miles, from Tsuruga to Sakai, in a two-day trial.

===2023 dedication to 2050 net-zero emission and investment in off-shore wind turbines===
In April 2023 Mitsui OSK Lines has published a 51 page commitment paper detailing their long-term plans on their company&#x27;s sustainability management.

<doc id="401429" wikidata="Q2572630" url="?curid=401429" title="Moorfields">
<text>Moorfields was an open space, partly in the City of London, lying adjacent to – and outside – its northern wall, near the eponymous Moorgate. It was known for its marshy conditions, the result of the defensive wall acting as a dam, impeding the flow of the River Walbrook and its tributaries.

Moorfields gives its name to the Moorfields Eye Hospital which occupied a site on the former fields from 1822–1899, and is still based close by, in the St Luke&#x27;s area of the London Borough of Islington.

==Setting==
Moorfields is first recorded in the late 12th century, though not by name, as a &quot;great fen&quot;. The fen was larger than the area subsequently known as Moorfields.

Moorfields was contiguous with Finsbury Fields, Bunhill Fields and other open spaces, and until its eventual loss in the 19th century, was the innermost part of a green wedge of land which stretched from the wall, to the open countryside which lay close by. Moorfields separated the western and eastern growth of London beyond the city wall – with the eastern extension being better known as the East End.

The fields were divided into four areas; the &quot;Little Moorfields&quot;, &quot;Moorfields proper&quot;, &quot;Middle Moorfields&quot; and &quot;Upper Moorfields&quot;.
===Great Fen===
The origins of Moorfields lie in a wider area, described by William Fitzstephen as the &quot;great fen which washed against the northern wall of the City&quot;. The marshy conditions appear to have been caused by London&#x27;s Wall acting as a dam, restricting the flow of the river.

The fen covered much of the Manor of Finsbury, but its exact extent is not clear. It has been suggested that it extended west from the Walbrook which fed it, extending to the vicinity of Old Street in the north, and the road from Cripplegate in the west. Other commentators have suggested that the topography of the area means the marsh probably didn’t extend as far west due to higher ground there, but did extend further north and possibly, in places, further east.

===Little Moorfields and Moorfields Proper===
The &quot;Little Moorfields&quot; and &quot;Moorfields proper&quot; (also known as &quot;Lower Moorfields&quot;) were just north of London&#x27;s wall, and from 1676 to 1815 included the Bethlem Hospital. &quot;Little Moorfields&quot; was the element that was left lying just west of Moorgate Street after a gap had been made in the wall to create the Moorgate, and the associated road from the north, in the 15th and 16th century. These parts were inside the City boundaries, lying in the Coleman Street Ward.

It is thought that this open space was not included within the City’s administrative boundaries until the 17th century, prior to that being part of the Manor of Finsbury.
The Walbrook, known at this point as &quot;Deepditch&quot; and running on the line of modern Blomfield Street, seems to have formed the eastern boundary of &quot;Moorfields proper&quot;. It also formed an administrative boundary, with Coleman Street Ward to the west (including the open spaces of &quot;Little Moorfields&quot; and &quot;Moorfields proper&quot;); while on the East End side lay the urbanised extra-mural ward of Bishopsgate Without, and also the parish of Shoreditch.

This section of the Walbrook, around Blomfield Street, was the focal point of the Walbrook Skulls; the result of the deposit of large numbers of decapitated Roman-era human skulls into the water. These are still regularly uncovered during building work.

===Middle and Upper Moorfields===
&quot;Middle Moorfields&quot; and &quot;Upper Moorfields&quot; lay outside the City, to the north-west of &quot;Moorfields proper&quot;, in the Manor of Finsbury. The manor was coterminous with the parish of St Luke&#x27;s (a late sub-division of the parish of St Giles-without-Cripplegate).

===Neighbouring areas===
The Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch (which replaced the parish of Shoreditch, being based on the same boundaries), had an electoral ward named Moorfields, this was adjacent to the former Moorfields (and also the famous Moorfields Eye Hospital) with only a small part of the area ever having been part of Moorfields, and only at an early date.

==History==
An early name for &quot;Moorfields proper&quot; appears to have been &quot;Moor Mead&quot;. The Moor place-name element usually refers to fen environments, and the wet nature of the area persisted, though this was improved by a drainage scheme in 1572.

In the 15th century the monasteries of Charterhouse and St Bartholomews diverted the headwaters of the Walbrook to their sites in the River Fleet catchment. It has been suggested that this caused a significant reduction in the flow of the river, causing Moorfields to become drier, and allowing the Mayor to construct the new Moorgate.

Moorgate was built by upgrading a postern built in 1415, and enlarged in 1472 and 1511. The gate remained poorly connected as there was no direct approach road from the south until 1846, long after the gate and wall were demolished.

After the Great Fire of London in 1666, refugees from the fire evacuated to Moorfields and set up temporary camps there. King Charles II of England encouraged the dispossessed to move on and leave London, but it is unknown how many newly impoverished and displaced persons instead settled in the Moorfields area.

In the early 18th century, Moorfields was the site of sporadic open-air markets, shows, and vendors/auctions. Additionally, the homes near and within Moorfields were places of the poor, and the area had a reputation for harbouring highwaymen, as well as brothels. James Dalton and Jack Sheppard both retreated to Moorfields when in hiding from the law. Parts of the area were known as public cruising areas for gay men. A path in the Upper Moorfields, beside a wall that separated the Upper and Middle Moorfields, was known as &quot;Sodomites Walk&quot;: the wall was removed in 1752 but the path remains as the south side of Finsbury Square. 

In 1780 it was the site of some of the most violent rioting during the Gordon Riots.

The district was once the site of The Foundery, a former cannon foundry turned preaching house and an early centre of Wesleyan Methodism.

A fashionable carpet manufactory was established here by Thomas Moore (c. 1700–1788) in the mid-eighteenth century. Moore&#x27;s carpet manufactory at Moore Place made a number of fine carpets commissioned by the architect and interior designer, Robert Adam, for the grand rooms he designed for his wealthy clients. Thomas Moore lived at his home on Chiswell Street until his death. His Moore Park factory remained in operation until 1793, when his daughter, Jane, and her husband, Joseph Foskett, sold the lease to another carpet manufacturer.

==Demise and legacy==
Much of Moorfields was developed in 1777, when Finsbury Square was developed; the remainder succumbed within the next few decades, notably when Moorfields proper was replaced by the modern Finsbury Circus in 1817.

Today the name survives in the names of Moorfields Eye Hospital (since moved to another site); St Mary Moorfields; Moorfields the short street (on which stands the headquarters of the British Red Cross) parallel with Moorgate (and containing some entrances to Moorgate station); and Moorfields Highwalk, one of the pedestrian &quot;streets&quot; at high level in the Barbican Estate. Moorfields Highwalk is featured in the music video to Robbie Williams&#x27; song &quot;No Regrets&quot;.

<text>Brigadier-General Nicholas Herkimer (also known as Nikolaus Herchheimer; – August 16, 1777) was an American military officer who fought during the French and Indian War and Revolutionary War. He died in 1777 from wounds suffered during the Battle of Oriskany.

==Early life and career==

Herkimer was born in the vicinity of German Flatts in the Mohawk Valley of the Province of New York, and was the elder brother of Loyalist officer Johan Jost Herkimer. Their parents were Catherine Petri and Johann Jost Herchheimer, a son of the Palatine immigrant Georg Herchheimer or Hirchemer from Sandhausen in the parish of Leimen south of Heidelberg. Nicholas was of slender build, with a dark complexion and black hair; he was not quite six feet tall. He could speak German, English and Mohawk. 

During the attack on German Flatts in the French and Indian War, he was involved in its defense. He was made a captain in the New York Militia on January 5, 1758, and repelled a second attack on German Flatts in April of that year. He built his new house in 1764 on the south shore of the Mohawk River, near the falls and the present-day city of Little Falls; the estate was attended by Irish indentured servants and slaves. Herkimer joined the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, being initiated in the St. Patrick&#x27;s Lodge in Johnstown, New York.

==American Revolution==

In July and August 1775, Herkimer headed the Tryon County Committee of Safety, and became colonel of the Tryon County militia. After the split in which Loyalist militiamen from the area withdrew to Canada, he was commissioned a brigadier-general in the county militia by the Provincial Congress on September 5, 1776. In June 1776, he led 380 men of the Tryon County militia to meet with the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant at Unadilla, New York. Herkimer asked the Mohawk and five other Iroquois nations to remain neutral, while Brant countered that the Indians owed their loyalty to George III.

When Herkimer learned of the British siege of Fort Schuyler to the west in late July 1777, he ordered the Tryon County militia to assemble at Fort Dayton. He marched them out to Fort Schuyler, about 28 miles to the west. His force marching in column was ambushed on August 6 by a mixed force of Loyalist and Hessian regulars and Indian warriors in the Battle of Oriskany. Herkimer&#x27;s horse was shot, and he was seriously wounded in the leg. In spite of his injuries, he sat propped up against a tree, lit his pipe, and directed his men in the battle, rallying them to avoid two panicked retreats. When they withdrew, they carried him home.

The brigade surgeon, William Petrie, dressed Herkimer&#x27;s wound in the field and placed him on a litter. The wound quickly became infected, but the decision to amputate the leg was delayed for about ten days after the battle. The operation was performed by an inexperienced surgeon, Robert Johnson, because Petrie had also been wounded in the battle and was not available. The operation went poorly, the wound bled profusely, and Herkimer died of the injury on August 16, at around the age of 49.

==Legacy==

Herkimer&#x27;s home, in what is now Little Falls, New York, is preserved as the Herkimer Home State Historic Site. Herkimer County, New York was named in his honor. His nephew, John Herkimer, later became a U.S. Congressman. A street in the Bronx, New York City, is named in his honor (Herkimer Place).

==In popular culture==
* Roger Imhof portrays Herkimer in the 1939 film &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, directed by John Ford. It is based on the 1936 historical novel by Walter D. Edmonds of the same name, about the Colonial era, settlements in the valley, and the American Revolutionary War.

<doc id="401436" wikidata="Q464264" url="?curid=401436" title="Rosalía de Castro">
<text>María Rosalía Rita de Castro (; 23 February 1837 – 15 July 1885), was a Galician poet and novelist, considered one of the most important figures of the 19th-century Spanish literature and modern lyricism. Widely regarded as the greatest Galician cultural icon, she was a leading figure in the emergence of the literary Galician language. Through her work, she projected multiple emotions, including the yearning for the celebration of Galician identity and culture, and female empowerment. She is credited with challenging the traditional female writer archetype.
==Life==

Writing in Galician and Spanish, after the period known as the &quot;Séculos Escuros&quot; (lit. Dark Centuries), she became an important figure of the Galician Romantic movement, known today as the &quot;Rexurdimento&quot; (&quot;Renaissance&quot;), along with Manuel Curros Enríquez and Eduardo Pondal. Her poetry is marked by &quot;saudade&quot;, an almost ineffable combination of nostalgia, longing and melancholy.

She married Manuel Murguía, a member of the important literary group known as the Royal Galician Academy, historian, journalist and editor of Rosalía&#x27;s books. The couple had seven children: Alexandra (1859–1937), Aura (1868–1942), twins Gala (1871–1964) and Ovidio (1871–1900), Amara (1873–1921), Adriano (1875–1876) and Valentina (stillborn, 1877). Only two of Rosalía&#x27;s children married, Aura in 1897 and Gala in 1922; neither they nor their siblings left any children, and thus, today there are no living descendants of Rosalía de Castro and her husband. Their son Ovidio was a promising painter, his career cut short by early death.

Rosalía published her first collection of poetry in Galician, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Galician Songs&quot;), on 17 May 1863. This date, 17 May, is now known as the &quot;Día das Letras Galegas&quot; (&quot;Galician Literature Day&quot;), and commemorates Rosalía&#x27;s achievement by dedicating, every year, this special day to a different writer, who must also write in the Galician language, since 1963. Día das Letras Galegas is an official holiday in the Autonomous Community of Galicia.

Relative poverty and sadness marked Rosalía&#x27;s life, in spite of this, she had a strong sense of commitment to the poor and to the defenseless. She was a strong opponent of abuse of authority and an ardent defender of women&#x27;s rights. Rosalía suffered from uterine cancer and died in Padrón, province of A Coruña, Spain, on 15 July 1885.

She is buried in the &quot;Panteón de Galegos Ilustres&quot;, a pantheon (mausoleum) in the Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

==Legacy==
Rosalía de Castro is today one of the unquestionable poets laureate of Galicia. Highly educated, expected to speak and write in Spanish and Galician she took the bold, unconventional step of writing her early poems in the Galician language. Her defiance earned her the contempt and spite of many that deemed Galician as a Spanish dialect fit &quot;only for the illiterate and the churlish&quot;. However, Rosalía&#x27;s defiant gesture won her the love and admiration of the common folk, who spoke Galician at home or on a daily basis. Schools in Galicia, in Spain, in Russia and in Uruguay, libraries, cultural associations, awards, parks, folklore groups, choirs, compositions of her poems, a Galician traditional morning song adorned with the lyrics of one of her poems, a professional sports team, monuments at home and abroad, a theater, restaurants, a label of white wine, lodgings, a banknote formerly in circulation, a postage stamp, a FS98 Iberia Airbus A340, a sea-rescue plane, a school train and many streets have all taken her name.

==International translations==
Small Stations Press published Rosalía de Castro&#x27;s &quot;Galician Songs&quot; in English, translated by *Erín Moure, in 2013. The Moure translation of de Castro&#x27;s &quot;New Leaves&quot; was published by Small Stations in September 2016. In 2010 Edwin Mellen Press also published &quot;the most thorough and representative volume of poetry and prose from Rosalía de Castro (1837–1885) ever translated into English.&quot; In 2007, Shearsman Books published a paperback of selected poems translated by Michael Smith. In 2004, Louis J. Rodrigues wrote for the literary magazine &quot;Babel&quot; a translation and analysis of two Rosalían poems, &quot;Nasín cando as prantas nasen&quot; and &quot;Negra Sombra&quot;. In 1991, State University of New York Press launched an English anthology edited and translated by Anna-Marie Aldaz, Barbara N. Gantt and Anne C. Bromley. In 1977 Kathleen Kulp-Hill translated several Galician poems as part of her work entitled &quot;Rosalía de Castro&quot;; this book is still available from AllBookstores.com. In 1964 the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a selection of Galician poems translated into English by Charles David Ley; this book may be found in Spanish Rare Books libraries.

In Japan, the first volume of Rosalían poetry was translated in 2009 by Takekazu Asaka which is available from DTP Publishing (Tokyo). In the nineteen-nineties Katsuyo Ohata wrote two articles in the journal, &quot;The Review of Inquiry and Research&quot; at Kansai Gaidai University (Osaka, Japan) on the Galician poet: &quot;El inconsciente creativo de Rosalía de Castro&quot; and &quot;En las orillas del Sar: El mundo íntimo de Rosalía de Castro.&quot;

Editoria Crisálida, in 2008, published an anthology of Rosalía&#x27;s Galician poems in Portuguese, translated by . There is a statue in her honor in the Galicia Square in the city of Porto, Portugal, by the sculptor Barata Feyo (September 1954).

In the French-speaking world Folle Avoine in 2003 offered a French anthology of Galician poems translated by Jose-Carlos Gonzalez.

== Recognition ==
The name Rosalía de Castro has been used by several institutions, public spaces and/or parks, and on consumer goods, thus showing the social influence and impact this poet has had on the region. Today, it is possible to find schools and universities named after the writer in the Spanish Autonomous Region of Galicia as well as other parts of Spain, Russia, Venezuela (Teatro Rosalía de Castro) and Uruguay also have places that bear her name. Furthermore, there are numerous parks, plazas and streets, cultural associations, prizes granted to people that are intimately linked with the Galician and Spanish languages, libraries, folk groups, choirs, and even a wine with the name &quot;Rías Baixas.&quot; There is also a plane from the airline Iberia, as well as an aircraft belonging to the Maritime Safety and Rescue Society (&quot;Salvamento Marítimo&quot;), have been given the name of Rosalía de Castro. Moreover, there are a multitude of monuments, commemorative plaques and sculptures dedicated to her in many parts of the world.

On 23 October 1979, the last of the 500 peseta bills was printed, being that in 1987, this bill was to be substituted by a coin of the same value. The bill had the portrait of Rosalía de Castro displayed on the obverse side, created by Pablo Sampedro Moledo: on the reverse side were the House/Museum of Rosalía located in Padrón and a few handwritten verses from Rosalía de Castro&#x27;s work &quot;Follas Novas.&quot; With the printing of this bill, Rosalía de Castro became, excepting Isabella I of Castile, the only non-allegorical female to be placed on the obverse side of a Spanish bill.

In 2019, the International Astronomical Union named the star HD 149143 after de Castro, as part of the NameExoWorlds contest.

<doc id="401437" wikidata="Q2016239" url="?curid=401437" title="Junius (writer)">
<text>Junius was the pseudonym of an anonymous British writer who contributed a series of letters to the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, a London-based political newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall, from 21 January 1769 to 21 January 1772. The signature had been already used, apparently by the same writer, in a letter written on 21 November 1768. These works, along with numerous other personal letters, were included in his &quot;Letters of Junius&quot; collection that was published in 1772.

==Choice of &quot;Junius&quot; as a pseudonym==
The name may have been chosen because the same author had already signed Lucius and Brutus, and wished to exhaust the name of Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman patriot who led the overthrow of the Roman monarchy. Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Roman poet Juvenal, who was thought also to have had the nomen Junius. Some say that the author of the Junius letters had previously written under numerous other pseudonyms, and that he continued to do so, under different pseudonyms, after the 36-month period (January 1769 – January 1772) in which the Junius letters were published. He may, for example, have written as Philo-Junius, a character who came to the rescue of Junius when it was clear that the public was misinterpreting his messages. There is weak evidence that he also wrote as Veteran, Nemesis and other anonymous correspondents published in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;.

==Objectives, goals and achievements==
There is a marked distinction between the main Letters of Junius, intended for the erudite public, and his miscellaneous letters. The latter deal with a variety of subjects, some of a purely personal nature, such as the alleged injustice of the Viscount Barrington, the secretary at war, to the officials of his department.

The Letters of Junius had a definite objective:
* to inform the public of their historical and constitutional rights and liberties as Englishmen;
* to highlight where and how the government had infringed upon these rights.

Foremost in his sights was the ministry of Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, a fellow Whig whom Junius viewed as particularly corrupt. Grafton&#x27;s administration had been formed in October 1768, when William Pitt the Elder was compelled by ill health to retire from office, and was a reconstruction of his cabinet of July 1766. Junius fought for the return to power of Pitt, who had recovered and was not on good terms with his successors.

Amongst the letters&#x27; promotion of Whig causes (e.g. sympathy with the American colonists and with John Wilkes) is the recurrent Whig hostility towards Scots and a resentment of perceived Scottish political and Court influence. As with Wilkes&#x27;s satirically named publication The North Briton, Junius resented the King&#x27;s identity as a Briton, not an Englishman, claiming &quot;believe me, Sir, you were persuaded to pay a very ill-judged compliment to one part of your subjects at the expense of another&quot; and asserting that the Scots &quot;have no claim to your favour&quot;.

Junius&#x27; private correspondence has been preserved, written in his usual disguised handwriting. He communicated with Pitt, with George Grenville, with Wilkes (all opponents of the Duke of Grafton), and also with Henry Sampson Woodfall, printer and part owner of the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;.

The letters are of interest on three grounds:
* their political significance;
* their style; and
* the mystery which long surrounded their authorship.

The matter of his letters is considered by some to be invective, though close inspection of his writings reveals a principled man ahead of his time, exposing blatant corruption by the only means available (anonymity) in a country struggling with the idea of freedom of speech.

He began with a general attack on the ministry for their personal immorality. An ill-judged defence of John Manners, Marquess of Granby, the popular Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, by Sir William Draper gave Junius an easy victory over a vulnerable opponent with weak arguments. It was in this short tussle that Junius&#x27; style and wit first developed a reputation and public audience. Junius then realised the potential he had to influence public opinion.

Confidently, Junius then went on to expose the problems at their cause—the ministries of Grafton, Lord North (Grafton&#x27;s cousin) and the Duke of Bedford. The core of Junius&#x27; arguments were the arbitrary appointments made by Grafton, presumably to stay in favour with the Duke of Bedford and his party (also known as the Bedfordites or Bloomsbury Gang). Most notable was Col. Henry Lawes Luttrell (later 2nd Earl Carhampton), whom Grafton appointed MP for Middlesex (instead of the duly elected Wilkes), and Richard Rigby, whom Grafton made Paymaster of the Forces. Junius ended with an assault on Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, who Junius argued had set dangerous legal precedents regarding press freedom and political libel from the Wilkes affair.

Junius was highly disappointed not to have influenced King George III in his 19 December 1769 letter. He tried to encourage the King to overcome his resentments towards the petty Wilkes and also to relinquish his trust in corrupt officials. Junius was not a radical anti-royal Whig, as many texts suggest, though he did trouble himself with explaining to the public the real constitutional role of the royal prerogative, and (if engaged correctly) how it benefited the country.

Contrary to some opinions, the practical effect of the letters was highly significant—they made Grafton unpopular enough to end his ministry in January 1770. Junius could only have been disappointed by Grafton&#x27;s replacement, Lord North. Junius confessed himself beaten in his private letter to Woodfall of 19 January 1773 for not having achieved his goals. Despite this, Junius&#x27; letters were noticed and talked about for generations afterwards and spread throughout Europe in many languages. His concepts on democratic elections, freedom of the press, legal history and the constitutional rights of individuals are now common-place. Few in history have influenced so many and sparked an interest in such real concepts of liberty.

==Style==

Latin literature (such as the satires of Juvenal, and the speeches of Cicero against Verres and Catiline) was not only studied but imitated at that time, and supplied the inspiration for numerous writings. If Junius was doing what others did, he did it better than anybody else, a fact which sufficiently explains his rapid popularity. His superiority lay in his style. Here also he was by no means original, and he was uneven. There are passages in his writings which can be best described in the words which Burke applied to another writer: &quot;A mere mixture of vinegar and water, at once vapid and sour&quot;. But at his best Junius attains to a high degree of artificial elegance and vigour. He shows the influence of Bolingbroke, of Swift, and above all of Tacitus, who appears to have been his favourite author. The imitation is never slavish. Junius adapts, and does not only repeat. No single sentence will show the quality of a style which produces its effect by persistence and repetition, but a typical passage as follows displays at once the method and the spirit. It is taken from Letter XLIX to the Duke of Grafton, 22 June 1771:

&quot;The profound respect I bear to the gracious prince who governs this country with no less honour to himself than satisfaction to his subjects, and who restores you to your rank under his standard, will save you from a multitude of reproaches. The attention I should have paid to your failings is involuntarily attracted to the hand which rewards them; and though I am not so partial to the royal judgment as to affirm that the favour of a king can remove mountains of infamy, it serves to lessen at least, for undoubtedly it divides, the burden. While I remember how much is due to his sacred character, I cannot, with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the meanest and the basest fellow in the kingdom. I protest, my Lord, I do not think you so. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame to which you have hitherto so happily directed your ambition, as long as there is one man living who thinks you worthy of his confidence, and fit to be trusted with any share in his government... With any other prince, the shameful desertion of him in the midst of that distress, which you alone had created, in the very crisis of danger, when he fancied he saw the throne already surrounded by men of virtue and abilities, would have outweighed the memory of your former services. But his majesty is full of justice, and understands the doctrine of compensations; he remembers with gratitude how soon you had accommodated your morals to the necessities of his service, how cheerfully you had abandoned the engagements of private friendship, and renounced the most solemn professions to the public. The sacrifice of Lord Chatham was not lost on him. Even the cowardice and perfidy of deserting him may have done you no disservice in his esteem. The instance was painful, but the principle might please.&quot;
==Readership==
The pre-established harmony between Junius and his readers accounts for the rapidity of his success, and for the importance attributed to him by Burke and Johnson. Before 1772 there appeared at least twelve unauthorized republications of his letters, made by speculative printers. In that year he revised the collection titled &quot;Junius: Stat nominis umbra&quot;, with a dedication to the English people and a preface. Other independent editions followed in quick succession. In 1801 one was published with annotations by Robert Heron. In 1806 another appeared with notes by John Almon. The first new edition of real importance was issued by the Woodfall family in 1812. It contained the correspondence of Junius with Henry Sampson Woodfall, a selection of the miscellaneous letters attributed to Junius, facsimiles of his handwriting, and notes by John Mason Good. Curiosity as to the mystery of the authorship began to replace political and literary interest in the writings. Junius himself had been early aware of the advantage he secured by concealment. &quot;The mystery of Junius increases his importance&quot; is his confession in a letter to Wilkes dated 18 September 1771.

Woodfall felt assured that

when kings and ministers are forgotten, when the force and direction of personal satire is no longer understood, and when measures are only felt in their remotest consequences; this book will, I believe, be found to contain principles worthy to be transmitted to posterity.

==Identity of Junius==

The identity of Junius is open to question and debate, and may never be finally resolved unless documents are found which establish his identity. Some scholars support the identification of Philip Francis. William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne claimed to know the identity of Junius a fortnight before his death on 7 May 1805, but died without revealing what he thought he knew.

==More recent use of Junius==

Samuel Saenger, political editor of the Fischer publishing house&#x27;s journal Neue Rundschau from 1908 to 1934, signed several of his articles as &#x27;Junius&#x27;. Most of these were political chronicles that presented a critical left-liberal perspective on German politics. Many of these texts were titled &#x27;Aus Junius&#x27; Tagebuch&#x27; – &#x27;From Junius&#x27; Diary&#x27;.

Rosa Luxemburg published the &quot;Junius Pamphlet&quot; in Switzerland in April 1916, and it was secretly distributed in Germany. The text, also known as &quot;The crisis in German Social Democracy&quot;, had been started in prison in February 1915. It was adopted as the founding policy statement of the International Group, better known as the Spartacus League, which became one element of the Communist Party of Germany in January 1919.

The pseudonym was used as well by the great Italian economist Luigi Einaudi, who expressed his liberal beliefs in two series of letters signed &#x27;Junius&#x27;: the former published in 1920, the latter in 1944, while he was living as a refugee in Switzerland.
Irish novelist James Joyce satirised the style of Junius in the 14th episode of his 1922 novel Ulysses, known as &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot;, which takes place in a maternity hospital. The Junius passage is one of 32 parodies of English prose style that make up the episode, in which Joyce charts the development of literary style through history alongside a complex reflection on fecundity and human reproduction.

Robert Goddard&#x27;s 2005 suspense novel &quot;Sight Unseen&quot; is set in the present day; however, the identity of Junius is a major theme in the novel.

The Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; has carried the following legend on its editorial or front page for many years: &quot;The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. &quot;Junius&quot;&quot;.

A Boston, Massachusetts, indie-rock band has been performing and recording under the name Junius since around 2003.

In the third season of the HBO series &quot;True Detective&quot;, Junius is a central figure to the cover-up and mystery. The character had been identified earlier as &quot;Mr. June.&quot;

<text>Henry Sampson Woodfall (21 June 173912 December 1805) was an English printer and journalist. He was born and lived in London.

==Biography==
Woodfall&#x27;s grandfather Henry Woodfall (c. 1686–1747), was the author of the ballad &quot;Darby and Joan&quot;, for which John Darby and his wife were the originals: the elder Woodfall had been apprenticed in 1701 to Darby, a printer in Bartholomew Close in the Little Britain area of London, who died in 1730.

Woodfall&#x27;s grandfather printed many of the works of Alexander Pope. Woodfall&#x27;s uncle George was a bookseller in Charing Cross. His father, Henry Woodfall (1713–1769), was the printer of the newspaper the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, and Woodfall was apprenticed to his father. At the age of nineteen, Woodfall took over the control of the newspaper.

In it appeared, between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772, the famous letters of Junius. In December 1769 Woodfall published a &quot;Letter to the King&quot; by Junius that brought legal charges against Woodfall and five others for seditious libel; Woodfall&#x27;s case went before a jury in June 1770 but a verdict of mistrial was handed down by Lord Mansfield in November 1770. Woodfall sold his interest in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; in 1793.

His son George Woodfall (1767–1844) was also in the family printing business. Woodfall&#x27;s younger brother, William Woodfall (1746–1803), a journalist, established in 1789 a daily paper called the &quot;Diary, or Woodfall&#x27;s Register&quot;, in which, for the first time, reports of parliamentary debates were published on the morning after they had taken place. William Woodfall&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Memory&quot; Woodfall based on his ability to memorize Parliamentary speeches at a time when journalists were not allowed to take notes or write down speeches while they were being delivered.

<text>Stelleroidea is a junior synonym of Asterozoa.

==History==

In 1900, Stelleroidea was included as a class in F. A. Bather&#x27;s echinoderm taxonomy, which grouped Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea within it as subclasses due to their Paleozoic history. In 1966, the &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot; included Stelleroidea as the only class within the subphylum Asterozoa, with Somasteroidea, Asteroidea, and Ophiuroidea as subclasses. By a 1980 revision of the &quot;Treatise&quot;&#x27;s taxonomy, Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea had been promoted to classes in place of Stelleroidea.

<text>Outback Steakhouse is an American chain of Australian-themed casual dining restaurants, serving American cuisine, based in Tampa, Florida. The chain has over 1,000 locations in 23 countries throughout North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. It was founded on March 15, 1988, with its first location in Tampa by Bob Basham, Chris T. Sullivan, Trudy Cooper, and Tim Gannon. It was owned and operated in the United States by OSI Restaurant Partners until it was acquired by Bloomin&#x27; Brands, and by other franchise and venture agreements internationally.

==History==
The first Outback Steakhouse location was opened on March 15, 1988, in Tampa, Florida.

Canadian Outback Steakhouse restaurants began in 1996. In March 2009, Outback Steakhouse Canada abruptly closed all nine locations in the province of Ontario, citing poor economic conditions, but in June 2009, Outback Steakhouse opened a location in Niagara Falls, Ontario, with a second location later opening in the same city. these are the only Outback Steakhouse locations operating in Canada.

Outback locations in Hawaii began to open in the mid 1990s, as part of a massive expansion across the country. On February 17, 2024, Outback’s parent company, Bloomin’ Brands, announced the permanent closure of all remaining Hawaii locations, as part of financial restructuring, citing a significant decrease in profits. This was part of a larger, mass closure of over 41 locations. All three locations in Hawaii were permanently closed by February 18, 2024.

Outback Steakhouse opened in the UK with locations in Birmingham, Basildon, Enfield, Romford, Stevenage and Staines. By September 2011, only its Basildon and Romford stores remained and they closed down on September 13, ending Outback&#x27;s foray into the UK market.

In 2006, a new Outback logo was introduced, dropping the old kangaroo logo for a more simplistic and modern Outback mountain range logo. With this new logo, Outback then went on an aggressive remodeling campaign, starting in 2008, renovating most of their locations, along with opening brand new ones, for a fresher, more modern look to their business model. This included the removal of their iconic neon signs for more energy efficient LEDs, and the switch from a dark, rustic feel to a brighter, more vibrant look. Today, few original-style Outback locations remain, with most of them either abandoned for newer locations, or renovated.

On June 14, 2007, OSI Restaurant Partners completed a stock repurchase plan, and the company became privately held. In April 2012, Bloomin&#x27; Brands, the current owner of Outback Steakhouse, filed with the SEC to raise up to $300 million in an initial public offering. Bloomin&#x27; Brands, Inc. became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol &quot;BLMN.&quot;

Most Outback locations are corporately owned by Bloomin Brands, however locations in California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico are separately owned by a corporate franchisee, Out West Restaurant Group.

Outback Steakhouse currently operates over 1,000 locations worldwide, with 694 in the United States.

==Menu==

===Bloomin&#x27; Onion===
The Bloomin&#x27; Onion is a signature Outback item, though it is not an Australian item and is not typically sold in Australia apart from this chain. It is a onion cut to &#x27;bloom&#x27; open, breaded, deep-fried and served with mayonnaise-horseradish sauce. Other restaurants offer items similar to the Bloomin&#x27; Onion, as in Chili&#x27;s Awesome Blossom (discontinued), Texas Roadhouse&#x27;s Cactus Blossom, and Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon&#x27;s Texas Rose. Many of the Bloomin&#x27; Onions have come under fire for high-calorie counts, sometimes going over 1,500 calories.

==Involvements==
===Community===
Outback Steakhouse has a program to support the communities in which its restaurants are located. They have also joined GroupRaise, a platform where non-profits can book restaurant fundraisers in their locations. On a national level, Outback partners with Heineken USA and their Heineken with a Heart program to raise funds for various organizations in these communities.

===Political===

The company and its founders are major contributors, via the Outback Steakhouse PAC, to the Republican Party, contributing $303,015 and $334,197 for the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, respectively. The Outback Steakhouse PAC itself is one of the largest donors in the food and beverage sector, second only to the National Restaurant Association, which itself represents 300,000 restaurants.

==Advertising==
*The company owns two blimps: the &quot;Bloomin&#x27; Onions I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, both named after their appetizer.
* For several years, the company ran a media campaign with an Australian-themed variation of the Of Montreal composition &quot;Wraith Pinned to the Mist (And Other Games).&quot;
* General (Ret) Tommy Franks sits on the Board Of Directors for OSI Restaurant Partners, INC., which owns Outback Steakhouse.

===Sports===
Outback Steakhouse was the title sponsor of the Outback Champions Series tennis events and NCAA football&#x27;s Outback Bowl. The sponsorship lasted through 2020.

Outback is also a partner of the Tampa Bay Lightning and has a concession stand in Amalie Arena.

====Motorsports====
In 2012, Outback Steakhouse became a sponsor of Ryan Newman and the No. 39 Chevrolet for Stewart-Haas Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. In their first race as sponsor, Newman won the 2012 Goody&#x27;s Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway. One of the promotions the company had with Newman was a free Bloomin&#x27; Onion on the Monday after a race in which Newman would finish in the top ten. Kevin Harvick took over Outback&#x27;s sponsorship and promotion in 2014 for two races in their No. 4 after Newman left the team. The company was on Harvick&#x27;s car from 2014 until 2018, including his championship in 2014, and in 2019 and until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the steakhouse was a personal sponsor which kept the Blooming Monday promotion around still. It ended after 2020. The company also sponsored future four-time Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon&#x27;s No. 67 for the AC-Delco 200 in the Busch Series during the 1990 season.

In September 2023, Outback Steakhouse sponsored Stephen Mallozzi, who had previously worked as a server at the restaurant, for a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at Bristol Motor Speedway.
