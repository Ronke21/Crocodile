<text>Mihail Kogălniceanu (; also known as Mihail Cogâlniceanu, Michel de Kogalnitchan; September 6, 1817 – July 1, 1891) was a Romanian liberal statesman, lawyer, historian and publicist; he became Prime Minister of Romania on October 11, 1863, after the 1859 union of the Danubian Principalities under &quot;Domnitor&quot; Alexandru Ioan Cuza, and later served as Foreign Minister under Carol I. He was several times Interior Minister under Cuza and Carol. A polymath, Kogălniceanu was one of the most influential Romanian intellectuals of his generation. Siding with the moderate liberal current for most of his lifetime, he began his political career as a collaborator of Prince Mihail Sturdza, while serving as head of the Iași Theater and issuing several publications together with the poet Vasile Alecsandri and the activist Ion Ghica. After editing the highly influential magazine &quot;Dacia Literară&quot; and serving as a professor at &quot;Academia Mihăileană&quot;, Kogălniceanu came into conflict with the authorities over his Romantic nationalist inaugural speech of 1843. He was the ideologue of the abortive 1848 Moldavian revolution, authoring its main document, &quot;Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova&quot;.

Following the Crimean War (1853–1856), with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, Kogălniceanu was responsible for drafting legislation to abolish Roma slavery. Together with Alecsandri, he edited the unionist magazine &quot;Steaua Dunării&quot;, played a prominent part during the elections for the ad hoc Divan, and successfully promoted Cuza, his lifelong friend, to the throne. Kogălniceanu advanced legislation to revoke traditional ranks and titles, and to secularize the property of monasteries. His efforts at land reform resulted in a censure vote, leading Cuza to enforce them through a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in May 1864. However, Kogălniceanu resigned in 1865, following his own conflicts with the monarch.

A decade later, he helped create the National Liberal Party, before playing an important part in Romania&#x27;s decision to enter the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878—a choice which consecrated her independence. He was also instrumental in the acquisition, and later colonization, of the Northern Dobruja region. During his final years, he was a prominent member and one-time President of the Romanian Academy, and briefly served as Romanian representative to France.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Iași, he belonged to the Kogălniceanu family of Moldavian boyars, being the son of &quot;Vornic&quot; Ilie Kogălniceanu, and the great-grandson of Constantin Kogălniceanu (noted for having signed his name to a 1749 document issued by Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos, through which serfdom was disestablished in Moldavia). Mihail&#x27;s mother, Catinca née Stavilla (or Stavillă), was, according to Kogălniceanu&#x27;s own words, &quot;[from] a Romanian family in Bessarabia&quot;. The author took pride in noting that &quot;my family has never searched its origins in foreign countries or peoples&quot;. Nevertheless, in a speech he gave shortly before his death, Kogălniceanu commented that Catinca Stavilla had been the descendant of &quot;a Genoese family, settled for centuries in the Genoese colony of Cetatea Albă (Akerman), whence it then scattered throughout Bessarabia&quot;.

During Milhail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s lifetime, there was confusion regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; in his speech to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father. It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and was the mother of Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu&#x27;s would-be protector and foe).

Kogălniceanu was educated at Trei Ierarhi monastery in Iași, before being tutored by Gherman Vida, a monk who belonged to the Transylvanian School, and who was an associate of Gheorghe Șincai. He completed his primary education in Miroslava, where he attended the Cuénim boarding school. It was during this early period that he first met the poet Vasile Alecsandri (they studied under both Vida and Cuénim), Costache Negri and Cuza. At the time, Kogălniceanu became a passionate student of history, beginning his investigations into old Moldavian chronicles.

With support from Prince Sturdza, Kogălniceanu continued his studies abroad, originally in the French city of Lunéville (where he was cared for by Sturdza&#x27;s former tutor, the &quot;abbé&quot; Lhommé), and later at the University of Berlin. Among his colleagues was the future philosopher Grigore Sturdza, son of the Moldavian monarch. His stay in Lunéville was cut short by the intervention of Russian officials, who were supervising Moldavia under the provisions of the &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; regime, and who believed that, through the influence of Lhommé (a participant in the French Revolution), students were being infused with rebellious ideas; all Moldavian students, including Sturdza&#x27;s sons and other noblemen, were withdrawn from the school in late 1835, and reassigned to Prussian education institutions.
===In Berlin===

During his period in Berlin, he came in contact with and was greatly influenced by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Gans, and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke, whose ideas on the necessity for politicians to be acquainted with historical science he readily adopted. In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu&#x27;s stay. He commented that, in later years, the politician adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations.

Kogălniceanu later noted with pride that he had been the first of Ranke&#x27;s Romanian students, and claimed that, in conversations with Humboldt, he was the first person to use the modern equivalents French-language of the words &quot;Romanian&quot; and &quot;Romania&quot; (&quot;roumain&quot; and &quot;Roumanie&quot;)—replacing the references to &quot;Moldavia(n)&quot; and &quot;Wallachia(n)&quot;, as well as the antiquated versions used before him by the intellectual Gheorghe Asachi; historian Nicolae Iorga also noted the part Kogălniceanu played in popularizing these references as the standard ones.

Kogălniceanu was also introduced to Frederica, Duchess of Cumberland, and became relatively close to her son George of Cumberland and Teviotdale, the future ruler of Hanover. Initially hosted by a community of the Huguenot diaspora, he later became the guest of a Calvinist pastor named Jonas, in whose residence he witnessed gatherings of activists in favor of German unification (&quot;see Burschenschaft&quot;). According to his own recollections, his group of Moldavians was kept under close watch by Alexandru Sturdza, who, in addition, enlisted Kogălniceanu&#x27;s help in writing his work &quot;Études historiques, chrétiennes et morales&quot; (&quot;Historical, Christian and Moral Studies&quot;). During summer trips to the Pomeranian town of Heringsdorf, he met the novelist Willibald Alexis, whom he befriended, and who, as Kogălniceanu recalled, lectured him on the land reform carried out by Prussian King Frederick William III. Later, Kogălniceanu studied the effects of reform when on visit to Alt Schwerin, and saw the possibility for replicating its results in his native country.

Greatly expanding his familiarity with historical and social subjects, Kogălniceanu also began work on his first volumes: a pioneering study on the Romani people and the French-language &quot;Histoire de la Valachie, de la Moldavie et des Valaques transdanubiens&quot; (&quot;A History of Wallachia, Moldavia, and of Transdanubian Vlachs&quot;, the first volume in a synthesis of Romanian history), both of which were first published in 1837 inside the German Confederation. He was becoming repulsed by the existence of Roma slavery in his country, and in his study, cited the example of active abolitionists in Western countries.

In addition, he authored a series of studies on Romanian literature. He signed these first works with a Francized version of his name, &quot;Michel de Kogalnitchan&quot; (&quot;Michael of Kogalnitchan&quot;), which was slightly erroneous (it used the partitive case twice: once in the French particle &quot;de&quot;, and a second time in the Romanian-based suffix &quot;-an&quot;).

Raising the suspicions of Prince Sturdza after it became apparent that he sided with the reform-minded youth of his day in opposition to the &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; regime, Kogălniceanu was prevented from completing his doctorate, and instead returned to Iași, where he became a princely adjutant in 1838.

===In opposition to Prince Sturdza===

Over the following decade, he published a large number of works, including essays and articles, his first editions of the Moldavian chroniclers, as well as other books and articles, while founding a succession of short-lived periodicals: &quot;Alăuta Românească&quot; (1838), &quot;Foaea Sătească a Prințipatului Moldovei&quot; (1839), &quot;Dacia Literară&quot; (1840), &quot;Arhiva Românească&quot; (1840), &quot;Calendar pentru Poporul Românesc&quot; (1842), &quot;Propășirea&quot; (renamed &quot;Foaie Științifică și Literară&quot;, 1843), and several almanacs. In 1844, as a Moldavian law freed some slaves in Orthodox Church property, his articles announced a great triumph for &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;new ideas&quot;.

Both &quot;Dacia Literară&quot; and &quot;Foaie Științifică&quot;, which he edited together with Alecsandri, Ion Ghica, and Petre Balș, were suppressed by Moldavian authorities, who considered them suspect. Together with Costache Negruzzi, he printed all of Dimitrie Cantemir&#x27;s works available at the time, and, in time, acquired his own printing press, which planned to issue the complete editions of Moldavian chronicles, including those of Miron Costin and Grigore Ureche (after many disruptions associated with his political choices, the project was fulfilled in 1852). In this context, Kogălniceanu and Negruzzi sought to Westernize the Moldavian public, with interest ranging as far as Romanian culinary tastes: the almanacs published by them featured gourmet-themed aphorisms and recipes meant to educate local folk about the refinement and richness of European cuisine. Kogălniceanu would later claim that he and his friend were &quot;originators of the culinary art in Moldavia&quot;.

With &quot;Dacia Literară&quot;, Kogălniceanu began expanding his Romantic ideal of &quot;national specificity&quot;, which was to be a major influence on Alexandru Odobescu and other literary figures. One of the main goals his publications had was expanding the coverage of modern Romanian culture beyond its early stages, during which it had mainly relied on publishing translations of Western literature—according to Garabet Ibrăileanu, this was accompanied by a veiled attack on Gheorghe Asachi and his &quot;Albina Românească&quot;. Mihail Kogălniceanu later issued clear criticism of Asachi&#x27;s proposed version of literary Romanian, which relied on archaisms and Francized phonemes, notably pointing out that it was inconsistent. Additionally, he evidenced the influence foreign poetry had on Asachi&#x27;s own work, viewing it as excessive. Tensions also occurred between Kogălniceanu and Alecsandri, after the former began suspecting his collaborator of having reduced and toned down his contributions to &quot;Foaie Științifică&quot;. During this period, Kogălniceanu maintained close contacts with his former colleague Costache Negri and his sister Elena, becoming one of the main figures of the intellectual circle hosted by the Negris in Mânjina. He also became close to the French teacher and essayist Jean Alexandre Vaillant, who was himself involved in liberal causes while being interested in the work of Moldavian chroniclers. Intellectuals of the day speculated that Kogălniceanu later contributed several sections to Vaillant&#x27;s lengthy essay about Moldavia and Wallachia (&quot;La Roumanie&quot;).

In May 1840, while serving as Prince Sturdza&#x27;s private secretary, he became co-director (with Alecsandri and Negruzzi) of the National Theater Iași. This followed the monarch&#x27;s decision to unite the two existing theaters in the city, one of which hosted plays in French, into a single institution. In later years, this venue, which staged popular comedies based on the French repertory of its age and had become the most popular of its kind in the country, also hosted Alecsandri&#x27;s debut as a playwright. Progressively, it also became subject to Sturdza&#x27;s censorship.

In 1843, Kogălniceanu gave a celebrated inaugural lecture on national history at the newly founded &quot;Academia Mihăileană&quot; in Iași, a speech which greatly influenced ethnic Romanian students at the University of Paris and the 1848 generation (&quot;see Cuvânt pentru deschiderea cursului de istorie națională&quot;). Other professors at the &quot;Academia&quot;, originating in several historical regions, were Ion Ghica, Eftimie Murgu, and Ion Ionescu de la Brad. Kogălniceanu&#x27;s introductory speech was partly prompted by Sturdza&#x27;s refusal to give him &quot;imprimatur&quot;, and amounted to a revolutionary project. Among other things, it made explicit references to the common cause of Romanians living in the two states of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as in Austrian- and Russian-ruled areas:
&quot;I view as my country everywhere on earth where Romanian is spoken, and as national history the history of all of Moldavia, that of Wallachia, and that of our brothers in Transylvania.&quot;

===Revolution===
Around 1843, Kogălniceanu&#x27;s enthusiasm for change was making him a suspect to the Moldavian authorities, and his lectures on History were suspended in 1844. His passport was revoked while he was traveling to Vienna as the secret representative of the Moldavian political opposition (attempting to approach Metternich and discuss Sturdza&#x27;s ouster). Briefly imprisoned after returning to Iași, he soon after became involved in political agitation in Wallachia, assisting his friend Ion Ghica: in February, during a Romantic nationalist celebration, he traveled to Bucharest, where he met members of the secretive &quot;Frăția&quot; organization and of its legal front, &quot;Soțietatea Literară&quot; (including Ghica, Nicolae Bălcescu, August Treboniu Laurian, Alexandru G. Golescu, and C. A. Rosetti).

Having sold his personal library to &quot;Academia Mihăileană&quot;, Kogălniceanu was in Paris and other Western European cities from 1845 to 1847, joining the Romanian student association (&quot;Societatea Studenților Români&quot;) that included Ghica, Bălcescu, and Rosetti and was presided over by the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine. He also frequented &quot;La Bibliothèque roumaine&quot; (&quot;The Romanian Library&quot;), while affiliating to the Freemasonry and joining the Lodge known as &quot;L&#x27;Athénée des étrangers&quot; (&quot;Foreigners&#x27; Atheneum&quot;), as did most other reform-minded Romanians in Paris. In 1846, he visited Spain, wishing to witness the wedding of Isabella II and the Duke of Cádiz, but he was also curious to assess developments in Spanish culture. Upon the end of his trip, he authored &quot;Notes sur l&#x27;Espagne&quot; (&quot;Notes on Spain&quot;), a French-language volume combining memoir, travel writing and historiographic record.

For a while, he concentrated his activities on reviewing historical sources, expanding his series of printed and edited Moldavian chronicles. At the time, he renewed his contacts with Vaillant, who helped him publish articles in the &quot;Revue de l&#x27;Orient&quot;. He would later state: &quot;We did not come to Paris just to learn how to speak French like the French do, but also to borrow the ideas and useful things of a nation that is so enlightened and so free&quot;.

Following the onset of the European Revolutions, Kogălniceanu was present at the forefront of nationalist politics. Though, for a number of reasons, he failed to sign the March 1848 petition-proclamation which signaled the Moldavian revolution, he was seen as one of its instigators, and Prince Sturdza ordered his arrest during the police roundup that followed. While evading capture, Kogălniceanu authored some of the most vocal attacks on Sturdza, and, by July, a reward was offered for his apprehension &quot;dead or alive&quot;. During late summer, he crossed the Austrian border into Bukovina, where he took refuge on the Hurmuzachi brothers&#x27; property (in parallel, the &quot;Frăția&quot;-led Wallachian revolution managed to gain power in Bucharest).

Kogălniceanu became a member and chief ideologue of the Moldavian Central Revolutionary Committee in exile. His manifesto, &quot;Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova&quot; (&quot;The Wishes of the National Party in Moldavia&quot;, August 1848), was, in effect, a constitutional project listing the goals of Romanian revolutionaries. It contrasted with the earlier demands the revolutionaries had presented to Sturdza, which called for strict adherence to the &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; and an end to abuse. In its 10 sections and 120 articles, the manifesto called for, among other things, internal autonomy, civil and political liberties, separation of powers, abolition of privilege, an end to &quot;corvées&quot;, and a Moldo-Wallachian union. Referring to the latter ideal, Kogălniceanu stressed that it formed:
&quot;the keystone without which the national edifice would crumble&quot;.

At the same time, he published a more explicit &quot;Project for a Moldavian Constitution&quot;, which expanded on how &quot;Dorințele&quot; could be translated into reality. Kogălniceanu also contributed articles to the Bukovinian journal &quot;Bucovina&quot;, the voice of revolution in Romanian-inhabited Austrian lands. In January 1849, a cholera epidemic forced him to leave for the French Republic, where he carried on with his activities in support of the Romanian revolution.

===Prince Ghica&#x27;s reforms===
In April 1849, part of the goals of the 1848 Revolution were fulfilled by the Convention of Balta Liman, through which the two suzerain powers of the &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; regime—the Ottoman Empire and Russia—appointed Grigore Alexandru Ghica, a supporter of the liberal and unionist cause, as Prince of Moldova (while, on the other hand, confirming the defeat of revolutionary power in Wallachia). Ghica allowed the instigators of the 1848 events to return from exile, and appointed Kogălniceanu, as well as Costache Negri and Alexandru Ioan Cuza to administrative offices. The measures enforced by the prince, together with the fallout from the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War, were to bring by 1860 the introduction of virtually all liberal tenets comprised in &quot;Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova&quot;.

Kogălniceanu was consequently appointed to various high level government positions, while continuing his cultural contributions and becoming the main figure of the loose grouping &quot;Partida Națională&quot;, which sought the merger of the two Danubian Principalities under a single administration. In 1867, reflecting back on his role, he stated:
&quot;There is not a single reform, not a single national act, from which my name would be absent. All the major laws were made and countersigned by me.&quot;

He inaugurated his career as a legislator under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware that he was not going to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.

Prince Ghica also attempted to improve the peasant situation by outlawing quit-rents and regulating that peasants could no longer be removed from the land they were working on. This measure produced little lasting effects; according to Kogălniceanu, &quot;the cause [of this] should be sought in the all-mightiness of landowners, in the weakness of the government, who, through its very nature, was provisional, and thus powerless&quot;.

===Ad hoc Divan===

Interrupted by Russian and Austrian interventions during the Crimean War, his activity as &quot;Partida Națională&quot; representative was successful after the 1856 Treaty of Paris, when Moldavia and Wallachia came under the direct supervision of the European Powers (comprising, alongside Russia and Austria, the United Kingdom, the Second French Empire, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, and Prussia). As he later acknowledged, members of the Divan had begun to consider the Paris agreements, and especially the 1858 convention regarding the two countries, as a Constitution of Romania, in place until 1864.

In addition, Kogălniceanu began printing the magazine &quot;Steaua Dunării&quot; in Iași: a unionist mouthpiece, it enlisted support from Alecsandri and his &quot;România Literară&quot;. Kogălniceanu encouraged Nicolae Ionescu to issue the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Étoile de Danube&quot; in Brussels, as a French-language version of &quot;Steaua Dunării&quot; which would also serve to popularize &quot;Partida Națională&quot;&#x27;s views. By that time, he was in correspondence with Jean Henri Abdolonyme Ubicini, a French essayist and traveler who had played a minor part in the Wallachian uprising, and who supported the Romanian cause in his native country.

Elected by the College of landowners in Dorohoi County to the ad hoc Divan, a newly established assembly through which Moldavians had gained the right to decide their own future, he kept in line with the Wallachian representatives to their respective Divan, and resumed his campaign in favor of union and increased autonomy, as well as the principles of neutrality, representative government, and, as he said later, rule by &quot;a foreign prince&quot;. However, both Kogălniceanu and Alecsandri initially presented themselves as candidates for the regency title of &quot;Caimacam&quot;—Alecsandri, who was more popular, renounced first in order to back Costache Negri. Negri&#x27;s candidature was dismissed by the Ottomans, who preferred to appoint Teodor Balș (June 1856).

Following the elections of September 1857, the entire &quot;Partida Națională&quot; chose to support Cuza for the Moldavian throne. This came after Nicolae Vogoride, the new &quot;Caimaicam&quot;, carried out an anti-unionist electoral fraud—a suffrage annulled by the common verdict of Napoleon III and Queen Victoria (August 9, 1857, first announced to the world on August 26).

He played the decisive part in the Divan&#x27;s decision to abolish boyar ranks and privileges, thus nullifying pieces of legislation first imposed under Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos. The final proposal, effectively imposing one law for all, universal conscription and an end to rank-based tax exemptions, was made by a commission which included Kogălniceanu and Vasile Mălinescu, and was passed by the Divan on October 29, 1857, with 73 out of 77 votes (the remaining 4 were all abstentions). Kogălniceanu noted with pride that &quot;The entire nation has accepted this great reform, and everyone, former Princes, great boyars, low-ranking boyars, privileged strata, have received this equalitarian reform, discarding, even without special laws, all that derived from the old regime, and even all that resembled the old regime&quot;. He recorded that only two members of the boyar class had subsequently refused to abide by the new principles—the &quot;Vornics&quot; Iordache Beldiman (in Moldavia) and Ioan Manu (in Wallachia). In November, &quot;Partida Națională&quot; passed legislation forcing the end of religious discrimination against all non-Orthodox Christians in Moldavia (specifically, against Roman Catholics and Gregorian Armenians). The law had been initiated by Negri.

Many of Kogălniceanu&#x27;s efforts were centered on bringing about an end to the peasant question, but, as he admitted, his boyar electorate threatened to recall him if he was to pursue this path any further. Consequently, he signed his name to the more moderate proposal of Dimitrie Rallet, which prevented boyars from instituting new &quot;corvées&quot;, while leaving other matters to be discussed by a future permanent Assembly. This project was instantly rejected by a solid majority of the Assembly, which in Kogălniceanu&#x27;s view, led to the creation of two poles, &quot;national liberal&quot; and conservative, replacing the unionist-separatist divide and causing political conflicts inside the former unionist majority (thus forming the National Liberal and Conservative parties).

Outmaneuvering the opposition of Vogoride and his group of conservative followers during new elections for the Divan, Kogălniceanu was able to promote Cuza in Moldavia on January 17, 1859, leading to Cuza&#x27;s election for a similar position in Wallachia (February 5)—the de facto union of the two countries as the United Principalities. In October 1858, he made a clear proposal regarding the unification, which, as he noted, carried the vote with only two opposing voices (Alecu Balș and Nectarie Hermeziu, the Orthodox vicar of Roman Bishopric), being publicly acclaimed by Ion Roată, the peasant representative for Putna County. During 1859, Kogălniceanu again stood in the ad hoc Divan and rallied support for Cuza from all factions of the unionist camp, while promoting his candidature in Bucharest—thus profiting from ambiguities in the Paris Treaty. On the day Cuza took the throne, to begin his rule as &quot;Domnitor&quot;, Mihail Kogălniceanu welcomed him with an emotional speech.

===Secularization of monastery estates===
From 1859 to 1865, Kogălniceanu was on several occasions the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities, then Prime Minister of Romania, being responsible for most of the reforms associated with Cuza&#x27;s reign. His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860, when Kogălniceanu became involved in the scandal involving Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, who opposed Cuza&#x27;s secularization of the monastery estates. In 1863, secularization was imposed by Cuza, with the land thus freed being divided among peasants—the land reform of 1864, which came together with the universal abolition of &quot;corvées&quot;.

Although political opposition prevented him from pushing agrarian reform at the time that he proposed it, Mihail Kogălniceanu is seen as the person responsible for the manner in which it was eventually carried out by Cuza. The changes in legislation came at the end of a lengthy process, inaugurated in 1860, when the institution regulating legislative projects for the two principalities, the Conservative-dominated &quot;Common Commission&quot; of Focșani, refused to create the basis for land reform. Instead, it provided for an end to &quot;corvées&quot;, while allowing peasants on boyar estates control over their own houses and a parcel of pasture. Known as &quot;Legea Rurală&quot; (the &quot;Rural Law&quot;), the project received instant support from the then-Premier Barbu Catargiu, leader of the Conservatives, and the target of vocal criticism on Kogălniceanu&#x27;s part. On June 6, 1862, the project was first debated in parliament, causing a standstill between Cuza and the Conservatives. As noted by historian L. S. Stavrianos, the latter considered the project advantageous because, while preserving estates, it created a sizable group of landless and dependent peasants, who could provide affordable labor.

Late in the same month, Catargiu was mysteriously assassinated on Mitropoliei Hill, on his way back from Filaret, where he had attended a festivity commemorating the Wallachian revolution (he was succeeded by Nicolae Kretzulescu, after the interim premiership of Apostol Arsachi). On June 23, &quot;Legea Rurală&quot; was passed by Parliament, but Cuza would not promulgate it. According to Kogălniceanu, the Conservatives Arsachi and Kretzulescu were reluctant to propose the law for review by Cuza, knowing that it was destined to be rejected. Discussions then drifted toward the matter of confiscating land from the Greek Orthodox monasteries in Romania (their sizable properties and traditional tax exemptions had been the subject of controversy ever since the Phanariote period). In late 1862, their revenues were taken over by the state, and, during the summer of the following year, a sum of 80 million piasters was offered as compensation to the Greek monks, in exchange for all of the monasteries&#x27; land.

As the Ottoman Empire proposed international mediation, Cuza took the initiative, and, on October 23, 1863, deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet, nominating instead his own selection of men: Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister, Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs. In order to prevent further international tensions, they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates, Greek as well as those of the incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries. The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes. Later, the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation, which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients, including Patriarch Sophoronius III. Consequently, the Romanian state considered the matter closed. As a direct consequence, one third of the arable land in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made available for a future land reform (one fifth to one fourth of the total arable land in the state as a whole).

===Cuza&#x27;s personal regime===
In the spring of 1864, the cabinet introduced a bill providing for an extensive land reform, which proposed allocating land based on peasant status. The &quot;fruntași&quot; (&quot;foremost people&quot;), who owned 4 or more oxen, were to receive 5 &quot;fălci&quot; of land, or approx. 7.5 hectares; &quot;mijlocași&quot; (&quot;middle people&quot;), with two oxen—approx. 6 hectares; &quot;pălmași&quot; (&quot;manual laborers&quot;), with no oxen—approx. 3 hectares. Peasants were to own their plots after making 14 yearly payments to their respective landowner. This caused uproar in Parliament, which represented around 4,000 mostly boyar electors, and voices from among the Conservatives deemed it &quot;insane&quot;. The latter party prepared a censure vote, based on the fact that Kogălniceanu had publicized the project through &quot;Monitorul Oficial&quot; in contradiction with the one endorsed by the Focșani Commission, thus going against the letter of the law—he later justified himself saying: &quot;Publication was necessary in order to quell the rural population, agitated by the [alternative project]&quot;. The cabinet handed in its resignation, but Cuza refused to countersign it.

Tensions mounted and, on May 14, 1864, Cuza carried out a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, coinciding with the moment when Conservatives imposed a censure vote. Kogălniceanu read in Parliament the monarch&#x27;s decision to dissolve it, after which Cuza introduced a new constitution, titled &quot;Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris&quot; (&quot;Statute Expanding the Paris Convention&quot;). Together with a law virtually establishing a system of universal male suffrage, it was submitted to the 1864 plebiscite, gaining support from 682,621 voters out of 754,148.

The new regime passed its own version of &quot;Legea Rurală&quot;, thus effectively imposing land reform, as well as putting an end to &quot;corvées&quot;. This was accomplished through discussions in August 1864 by the newly established Council of State, where the law was advanced by, among others, Kogălniceanu, Bolintineanu, George D. Vernescu, Gheorghe Apostoleanu and Alexandru Papadopol-Callimachi. Kogălniceanu&#x27;s other measures as minister included: the establishment of Bucharest University, the introduction of identity papers, the establishment of a national police corps (comprising &quot;Dorobanți&quot; units), the unification of Border Police.

More reserved members of the Council asked for the land reform law not to be applied for a duration of three years, instead of the presumed April 1865 deadline, and Cuza agreed. Arguing that Cuza&#x27;s decision was &quot;the very condemnation and crushing of the law&quot;, Kogălniceanu worried that peasants, informed of their future, could no longer be persuaded to carry out &quot;corvées&quot;. He threatened Cuza with his resignation, and was ultimately able to persuade all parties involved, including the opposition leader Kretzulescu, to accept the law&#x27;s application as of spring 1865; a proclamation by Cuza, &quot;Către locuitorii sătești&quot; (&quot;To the Rural Inhabitants&quot;) accompanied the resolution, and was described by Kogălniceanu as &quot;the political testament of Cuza&quot;. Despite this measure, factors such as a growing population, the division of plots among descendants, peasant debts and enduring reliance on revenues from working on estates, together with the widespread speculation of estate leaseholders and instances where political corruption was detrimental to the allocation of land, made the reform almost completely ineffectual on the long term, and contributed to the countryside unrest which culminated in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1907.

With Kogălniceanu&#x27;s participation, the authoritarian regime established by Cuza succeeded in promulgating a series of reforms, notably introducing the Napoleonic code, public education, and state monopolies on alcohol and tobacco. At the same time, the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides, especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal. In early 1865, Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu, whom he dismissed soon after. Over the following months, the administration went into financial collapse, no longer able to provide state salaries, while Cuza came to rely on his own &quot;camarilla&quot; (courtiers).

After 1863, relations between Mihail Kogălniceanu and his friend Vasile Alecsandri soured dramatically, as the latter declared himself disgusted with politics. Alecsandri withdrew to his estate in Mircești, where he wrote pieces critical of the political developments.

===Carol&#x27;s ascent and Mazar Pașa Coalition===

&quot;Domnitor&quot; Cuza was ultimately ousted by a coalition of Conservatives and Liberals in February 1866; following a period of transition and maneuvers to avert international objections, a perpetually unified Principality of Romania was established under Carol of Hohenzollern, with the adoption of the 1866 Constitution. Two years later, in recognition of his scholarly contributions, Kogălniceanu became a member of the newly created Romanian Academy Historical Section.

In November 1868 – January 1870, he was again Minister of the Interior under Dimitrie Ghica. In this capacity, he regulated the design of police uniforms, and investigated the murder of Cuca-Măcăi peasants by rogue Gendarmes.

He was at the time involved in a new diplomatic effort: the Ghica government was aiming to receive formal recognition of the name &quot;Romania&quot;, as opposed to &quot;United Principalities&quot;. The bid was successful, after the Ottomans gave their approval, but marked a slump in Romania&#x27;s relationship with Prussia—its Minister President, Otto von Bismarck, abstained on the matter. Such tensions were only worsened when Prussian money was attracted by Ghica into the development of a Romanian Railways system: later Romanian governments confronted themselves with the &quot;Strousberg Affair&quot;, a volatile combination of investment scheme failure and anti-Prussian sentiment (&quot;see Republic of Ploiești&quot;). Although generally depicted as Prussian-friendly, the Conservatives were also opposed to such dealings, and their daily &quot;Térra&quot; referred to Kogălniceanu as the guilty party. Overall, however, the Francophile Ghica and his minister were not only hostile to Prussia, but also tried to help the national cause of Romanians living in Austria-Hungary (Transylvania, Bukovina, etc.). Reportedly, these pitted them against &quot;Domnitor&quot; Carol, the Prussian-born Germanophile.

Kogălniceanu&#x27;s term was confirmed by the 1869 election, after which he was able to persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without expressing his consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu&#x27;s main supporters in the chamber. Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party&#x27;s moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.

Even after Cuza left the country and settled in Baden, relations between him and Kogălniceanu remained respectful, but distant: in summer 1868, when both of them were visiting Vienna, they happened to meet, and, without exchanging words, raised their hats as a form of greeting. On May 27, 1873, Kogălniceanu, alongside Alecsandri, Costache Negri, Petre Poni and other public figures, attended Cuza&#x27;s funeral in Ruginoasa. Speaking later, he noted: &quot;Cuza has committed great errors, but [the 1864 &quot;Către locuitorii sătești&quot;] shall never fade out of the hearts of peasants, nor from Romania&#x27;s history&quot;.

Kogălniceanu carried on as leader of pragmatic-reformist liberalism in Romania; in loose opposition to the Conservative Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu (1875), he began talks with the radical faction of the liberal trend (most notably, Ion Brătianu, Dimitrie Sturdza, Ion Ghica, C. A. Rosetti, Dimitrie Brătianu, and Alexandru G. Golescu), which were carried at the Bucharest residence of Pasha Stephen Bartlett Lakeman. On May 24, 1875, negotiations resulted in the creation of the National Liberal Party—the so-called &quot;Coalition of Mazar Pașa&quot;.

Kogălniceanu also signed his name to the proclamation &quot;Alegătorul Liber&quot; (&quot;The Enfranchised Voter&quot;), which stated the main National Liberal goals. He was however an outspoken adversary of his former collaborator Nicolae Ionescu, who, as leader of the liberal splinter group &quot;Fracțiunea liberă și independentă&quot;, rejected National Liberal politics. In an 1876 speech in front of Parliament, Kogălniceanu attacked Ionescu and his supporters for their political and academic positions, approval from the conservative literary society &quot;Junimea&quot; and its anti-liberal gazette &quot;Timpul&quot;.

Like his political career, Kogălniceanu&#x27;s tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies. Also in 1875, he issued from Paris an anti-Austrian brochure about the Romanian cause in Bukovina. Called &quot;Rapt de la Bukovine d&#x27;après les documents authentiques&quot; (&quot;The Rape of Bukovina, from Genuine Documents&quot;), it reused old texts collected by the Hurmuzachis. The propaganda effort won support from across the floor: &quot;Junimea&quot; Conservatives (Titu Maiorescu, Theodor Rosetti, Ioan Slavici), National Liberals (D. Sturdza) and independents (Alexandru Odobescu) all signed up to the enterprise.

Kogălniceanu joined other National Liberals in expressing opposition to the trade convention Catargiu had signed with Austria-Hungary, which was advantageous to the latter&#x27;s exports, and which, they claimed, was leading Romanian industry to ruin. He accepted it while in office, but looked into adopting European-like patent laws, as a measure of encouraging local industries. A National Liberal government would repeal the agreement in 1886.

===Romanian independence===

Serving as Foreign Affairs Minister in the Ion Brătianu cabinet (spring-summer 1876, and again from April 1877 to November 1878), Mihail Kogălniceanu was responsible for Romania entering the War of 1877–1878 on the Russian side, which led the country to proclaim its independence (&quot;see Romanian War of Independence&quot;). He initially tried to obtain diplomatic recognition from various states, but the European states rejected the offer, and the Ottoman Porte ignored them. The Russian envoy Dimitri Stuart received instructions to &quot;halt&quot; Kogălniceanu&#x27;s initiatives, so as not to aggravate the &quot;Eastern Question&quot;.

Upon his return to office, Kogălniceanu personally organized conspiratorial meetings with the Russian diplomat Aleksandr Nelidov, and approved Russian demands in exchange for co-belligerency. With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu, he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance, contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council. He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic, who was still one of the powers supervising Romania; Louis, duc Decazes, the French Foreign Minister, declined to give him a reassuring answer, and pointed that, were Romania to join up with Russia, the other powers would cease offering their protection. Making note of this, Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment.

In the end, the Russian declaration of war came as a surprise to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not been informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country&#x27;s only choice.

On May 9, 1877, it was through Kogălniceanu&#x27;s speech in Parliament that Romania acknowledged she was discarding Ottoman suzerainty. He was rewarded by Carol, becoming one of the first three statesmen received into the Order of the Star of Romania. The Minister also negotiated the terms under which the Romanian Land Forces were to join the war effort in Bulgaria, specifically demanding Russian reparations and indemnities.

Over the following year, he coordinated efforts to have the act recognized by all European states, and stated that his government&#x27;s policies were centered on &quot;as rapid as possible, the transformation of foreign diplomatic agencies and consulates in Bucharest into legations&quot;. Late in 1877, he traveled to Austria-Hungary and met Austrian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy. He recorded a mood of opposition to the Romanian military effort, but received guarantees of border security. The main challenge was convincing Bismarck, who had since become Chancellor of the German Empire, and who was very reserved on the issue of Romanian independence.

===Congress of Berlin and Northern Dobruja===

Upon the war&#x27;s end, Mihail Kogălniceanu and Ion Brătianu headed the Romanian delegation to the Congress of Berlin. In this capacity, they protested Russia&#x27;s offer to exchange the previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja for Southern Bessarabia, a portion of Bessarabia that Romania had received under the 1856 Treaty of Paris. This came after months of tension between Romania and Russia, generated over the territorial issue and the Russian claim to be representing Romania at Berlin: Kogălniceanu&#x27;s envoy (Eraclie Arion) had even threatened the Russians with a Romanian denunciation of their alliance, and 60,000 Romanian soldiers were prepared for the defense of Southern Bessarabia. The Conference&#x27;s ultimate decision (Berlin Treaty) was in favor of Russia&#x27;s proposal, largely due to support from Andrássy and William Henry Waddington, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. Additional pressures came from Bismarck. The Russians themselves did register some setbacks by the end of the Conference. Their demands for Romania to allow indefinite military transit through Northern Dobruja were made ineffectual by the opposition of other European states, and Kogălniceanu was able to obtain the retrocession of Snake Island.

As an effect of Waddington&#x27;s intervention, Romania also agreed to resolve the issue of Jewish Emancipation. The government pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (&quot;see History of the Jews in Romania&quot;). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.

This outcome was the subject of controversy in Romania, where the territorial exchange was generally considered unfair, with some voices even arguing that the country could again accept Ottoman suzerainty as a means to overturn the state of affairs. Unbeknown to them, the cession of Southern Bessarabia had been secretly agreed upon with Nelidov in early 1877. Even then, against his subordinates in the diplomatic corps, but in consonance with the &quot;Domnitor&quot;, Kogălniceanu privately noted that he &quot;fully agreed&quot; with it, and that he regarded the new province as a &quot;splendid acquisition&quot;. However, in April 1877, Kogălniceanu had explicitly assured Parliament that no real threat loomed over Southern Bessarabia. By that point in time, both the Germans and the Austrians had begun suspecting that Kogălniceanu was in fact a favorite and agent of influence of the Russians, and, reportedly, he even encouraged the rumor to spread. Andrássy reportedly commented: &quot;Prince Carol is really unfortunate to have people like Mr. Kogălniceanu in his service&quot;.

Opposition came from both Conservative and National Liberal legislators, who viewed Northern Dobruja as an inhospitable, nonstrategic and non-Romanian territory. Contrarily, with his proclamation to the peoples of Northern Dobruja, Kogălniceanu enshrined the standard patriotic narrative of the events: he asserted that the region had been &quot;united&quot; with Romania, as a &quot;Romanian land&quot;, because of the people&#x27;s wishes and sacrifices. During the heated parliamentary sessions of late September 1878, he helped swing the vote in favor of the annexation, with speeches which also helped transform the public&#x27;s mood, and which promised a swift process of Romanianization. These addresses are credited with having first backdated the Romanian claim to ca. 1400, when Wallachia briefly held the Principality of Karvuna.

In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began organizing the administration of Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession played a part in the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (Mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Bessarabian homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the &quot;Muhajir Balkan&quot;, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (&quot;miriè&quot;). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.

===Final years===

Kogălniceanu subsequently represented his country in France (1880), being the first Romanian envoy to Paris, and having Alexandru Lahovary on his staff. The French state awarded him its Legion of Honour, with the rank of &quot;Grand Officier&quot;. In January 1880–1881, Kogălniceanu oversaw the first diplomatic contacts between Romania and Qing China, as an exchange of correspondence between the Romanian Embassy to France and Zeng Jize, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom.

Upon his return to the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania, Kogălniceanu played a prominent part in opposing further concessions for Austria, on the issue of international Danube navigation. By 1883, he was becoming known as the speaker of a liberal conservative faction of the National Liberal group. Kogălniceanu and his supporters criticized Rosetti and others who again pushed for universal (male) suffrage, and argued that Romania&#x27;s fragile international standing did not permit electoral divisiveness.

After withdrawing from political life, Kogălniceanu served as Romanian Academy President from 1887 to 1889 (or 1890). Having fallen severely ill in 1886, he spent his final years editing historical documents of the Eudoxiu Hurmuzaki fund, publicizing Ancient Greek and Roman archeological finds in Northern Dobruja, and collecting foreign documents related to Romanian history. One of his last speeches, held in front of the academy and witnessed by both Carol, who had since become King of Romania, and his wife Elisabeth of Wied, was a summary of his entire career as a politician, intellectual, and civil servant. In August 1890, while traveling through the Austrian region of Vorarlberg, he was troubled by news that Alecsandri had died at his home in Mircești. Writing to Alecsandri&#x27;s wife Paulina, he asked: &quot;I could not be present at his funeral, [therefore] you&#x27;ll allow me, my lady, since I have unable to kiss him either alive or dead, to at least kiss his grave!&quot;

Mihail Kogălniceanu died while undergoing surgery in Paris, and was succeeded in his seat at the academy by Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol. He was buried in his native Iași, at the Eternitatea cemetery.

===Liberalism and conservatism===
Mihail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s contributions as a leader of opinion and statesman have won acclaim for their role in shaping the development of modern Romania before and after 1848. Nicolae Iorga, a major historian of the 20th century, celebrated Kogălniceanu as &quot;the founder of modern Romanian culture, the thinker who has seen in clarity the free and complete Romania [...], the redeemer of peasants thrown into serfdom [a reference to &quot;corvées&quot;], the person understanding all the many, secretive, and indissoluble connections linking the life of a people to the moral quality and the energy of its soul&quot;.

Kogălniceanu was a democratic and nationalist politician who combined liberalism with the conservative principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from the policies of the Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. German statesmen were however disinclined to consider him one of their own: Bernhard von Bülow took for granted rumors that he was an agent of the Russians, and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham.

Supportive of constitutionalism, civil liberties, and other liberal positions, Kogălniceanu prioritized the nation over individualism, an approach with resonated with the tendencies of all his fellow Moldavian revolutionaries. In maturity, Kogălniceanu had become a skeptic with respect to the French Revolution and its Jacobin legacy, arguing: &quot;civilization stops when revolutions begin&quot;. At the same time, his connections within Freemasonry, mirroring the conviction and affiliation of most 1848 revolutionaries, were an important factor in ensuring the success of Romanian causes abroad, and arguably played a part in the election of Cuza, who was himself a member of the secretive organization.

Inside the Romanian liberal faction, and in contrast to his moderation on other topics, he was among the very few to tie together modernization, democracy, and the need to improve the situation of peasants (other notable politicians to do so were Nicolae Bălcescu, who died in late 1852, and Rosetti, who advocated a strict adherence to majoritarianism). Kogălniceanu praised Bălcescu&#x27;s manifestos and activism in favor of the peasantry, indicating that they formed a precedent for his own accomplishments, while deploring the Wallachian uprising&#x27;s failure to advance a definitive land reform. When faced with a negative response in the census-elected Parliament just prior to Cuza&#x27;s coup, he defended his land reform project with the words:
&quot;Two thousand boyars do not a nation make; that is an undeniable truth.&quot;

Late in his life, while crediting the University of Berlin and its notions of patriotism with having provided him with &quot;the love for the Romanian motherland and the &quot;liberal spirit&quot; [emphasis in original]&quot;, he stressed:
&quot;In my lengthy combats and actions, in the grim persecutions that have more than once been exercised as a means to crush me, I always had before my eyes those beautiful words which [...] Prince Hardenberg indicated as the strongest means to reawaken the character and manliness of the German people in order to liberate it from the foreign yoke, to raise and increase Germany: «Democratic principles as part of a monarchic government!»&quot;

===Antisemitism===
Like many of his fellow Romanian liberals, Kogălniceanu advocated a series of antisemitic policies. He used his position as Internal Affairs Minister in the Dimitrie Ghica executive to resume the expulsions of Jewish community members from the countryside (thus denying them various sources of income). When faced with the official protests of European states, he replied that the matter was nobody&#x27;s business but Romania&#x27;s. He usually referred to the Jewish community in general with the insulting term &quot;jidani&quot;, and accepted their presence on Romanian soil as a concession to their alleged &quot;too numerous and too powerful presence in Europe&quot;. During the 1930s, such attitudes, together with Kogălniceanu&#x27;s involvement in peasant causes, were cited as a precedent by politicians of the fascist National Christian Party and Iron Guard, who, while promoting rural traditionalism, advocated restricting civil rights for the Jewish community.

Nevertheless, Kogălniceanu&#x27;s antisemitic discourse was nuanced and less violent than that of some of his contemporaries. According to historian George Voicu, he stood for &quot;a complicated balance in dealing with the &#x27;Jewish question&#x27;&quot;, one between &quot;antisemitic intransigence&quot; and &quot;concessions&quot;. The more radical antisemite and National Liberal Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu expressed much criticism of this moderate stance (which he also believed was represented within the party by Rosetti and Ion Ghica), and he even claimed that Kogălniceanu was a secret &quot;faithful&quot; of the Talmud. In 1885, Kogălniceanu strongly objected to a National Liberal cabinet decision to expel Moses Gaster, a renowned Jewish scholar, stating that the latter was &quot;[the] only man who works in this country&quot; (he would later celebrate him as the man &quot;to whom Romanian literature owes so much&quot;). Five years later, as &quot;rapporteur&quot; on naturalization issues, he conferred citizenship upon Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who was a Russian-born Jewish immigrant. Shortly before his death, he reportedly endorsed a similar measure for Jewish scholar Lazăr Șăineanu, expressing condemnation for those antisemites within his own party who made efforts to block it.

===Cultural tenets===
In his polemical history tracing the development of literary criticism and its role in Romanian culture, the 20th century author Garabet Ibrăileanu made ample mention of Kogălniceanu&#x27;s role in combating nationalist excesses, in particular the post-1840 attempts by Transylvanian and Wallachian intellectuals to change the fabric of the Romanian language by introducing strong influences from Latin or other modern Romance languages. To illustrate this view, he cited Kogălniceanu&#x27;s &quot;Cuvânt pentru deschiderea cursului de istorie națională&quot;, which notably states:
&quot;In me you shall find a Romanian, but ever to the point where I would contribute in increasing Romanomania, that is to say the mania of calling ourselves Romans, a passion currently reigning foremost in Transylvania and among some of the writers in Wallachia.&quot;

Ibrăileanu additionally credited the Moldavian faction, Kogălniceanu included, with having helped introduce spoken Romanian into the literary language, at a time when both Ion Heliade Rădulescu and successors of the Transylvanian School made use of the dialect prevalent in Orthodox and Greek-Catholic religious culture. This was in connection with Kogălniceanu&#x27;s advocacy of pragmatic Westernization: &quot;Civilization never does banish the national ideas and habits, but rather improves them for the benefit of the nation in particular and of humanity in general&quot;. He was averse to fast cultural reforms, stressing that acclimatization was always required.

A generation younger than Ibrăileanu, George Călinescu also noted the contrast between Mihail Kogălniceanu and his predecessors, as two sets of &quot;Messianist&quot; intellectuals—in this contrast, Heliade Rădulescu was &quot;hazy and egotistic&quot;, whereas Kogălniceanu and others had &quot;a mission which they knew how to translate into positive terms&quot;. As a historian, Kogălniceanu notably introduced several more or less influential Romantic nationalist theses: after 1840, he was noted for stressing the image of the 17th-century Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave as a unifier of Romania, although this view had not been at all present in his earlier essays; he proposed that the Romanian folk was among the first European peoples to record history in their national language, although the earliest Romanian-language chronicles date back to the 17th century; additionally, he argued that the Second Bulgarian Empire was a Romanian state. In some of his works, he claimed that Romanians traditionally practiced endogamy to preserve their purity. His 1837 study of the Romani people (&quot;Esquisse sur l&#x27;histoire, les moeurs et la langue des Cigains&quot;, or &quot;Sketch of the History, Mores and Language of the &quot;Cigains&quot;&quot;) is however still seen as a groundbreaking work in its field. According to historian Viorel Achim, while it &quot;does not reach the standards of scientific research&quot;, the book is still &quot;a genuine contribution&quot; to &quot;Romology&quot;, and &quot;a work of reference&quot;.

As early as 1840, Mihail Kogălniceanu was urging writers to seek inspiration for their work in Romanian folklore in creating a &quot;cultured literature&quot;. In 1855, after the Wallachian revolution was defeated and most of its leaders went into exile, he noted that the lighter toll Russian intervention had in Moldavia contributed to the preservation of literature; alongside similar statements made by Vasile Alecsandri, this allowed Ibrăileanu to conclude that, after 1848, Moldavia played a bigger part in shaping the cultural landscape of Romania. Writing more than half a century after the critic, historian Lucian Boia also noted that, while Kogălniceanu stressed national unity, his discourse tended to place emphasis on Moldavian particularities. Also according to Ibrăileanu, Kogălniceanu and Alecu Russo have set the foundation for the local school of literary criticism, and, together, had announced the cultural professionalism advocated by &quot;Junimea&quot; after the 1860s. The latter conclusion was partly shared by Călinescu, Tudor Vianu and literary researcher Z. Ornea. Nevertheless, in its reaction against the 1848 generation, &quot;Junimea&quot;, and especially its main figure Titu Maiorescu, tended to ignore or outright dismiss Kogălniceanu&#x27;s causes and the attitudes he expressed.

While commenting on the differences between Moldavian and Wallachian literature, Paul Zarifopol gave a more reserved assessment of Kogălniceanu&#x27;s position, arguing that the emphasis he had placed on &quot;national taste&quot; would occasionally result in acclaim for mediocre writers such as Alexandru Hrisoverghi. Călinescu observed that much of Kogălniceanu&#x27;s own prose works imitated the style of his friend Costache Negruzzi, without carrying the same artistic weight, while noting that his few works of autobiography featured &quot;pages of gracious [and] good-natured melancholy&quot;, which he attributed to the author&#x27;s traditional upbringing. Also among Kogălniceanu&#x27;s anthumous writings was &quot;Fiziologia provincialului în Iași&quot; (&quot;The Physiology of the Parochial Man in Iași&quot;), closely based on a French model by Pierre Durand and, through it, echoing Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s &quot;Physiologie du goût&quot;. It was part of a series of such texts, popular in his generation and deemed &quot;the first age of Romanian realism&quot; by researcher Maria Protase. Among the other pieces were two comedy plays, both written in 1840, when he was co-director of the National Theater Iași: &quot;Două femei împotriva unui bărbat&quot; (&quot;Two Women against One Man&quot;) and &quot;Orbul fericit&quot; (&quot;The Happy Blind Man&quot;). Kogălniceanu&#x27;s &quot;Notes sur l&#x27;Espagne&quot; was published decades after his death, and received much critical acclaim.

In 1841, Kogălniceanu, together with Costache Negruzzi, printed the first cookbook in the Romanian language: &quot;200 Proven Recipes for Dishes, Pastries, and Other Household Works&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Descendants===
Mihail Kogălniceanu was married to Ecaterina Jora (1827–1907), the widow of Iorgu Scorțescu, a Moldavian Militia colonel; they had more than eight children together (three of whom were boys). The eldest son, Constantin, studied Law and had a career in diplomacy, being the author of an unfinished work on Romanian history. Ion, his brother, was born in 1859 and died in 1892, being the only one of Mihail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s male children to have heirs. His line was still surviving in 2001. Ion&#x27;s son, also named Mihail, established the &quot;Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation&quot; in 1935 (in 1939–1946, it published a magazine named &quot;Arhiva Românească&quot;, which aimed to be a new series of the one published during the 1840s; its other projects were rendered ineffectual by the outbreak of World War II).

Vasile Kogălniceanu, the youngest son, was noted for his involvement in agrarian and left-wing politics during the early 20th century. A founder of &quot;Partida Țărănească&quot; (which served as an inspiration for the Peasants&#x27; Party after 1918), he was a collaborator of Vintilă Rosetti in campaigning for the universal suffrage and legislating Sunday rest. A manifesto to the peasants, issued by him just before the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1907, was interpreted by the authorities as a call to rebellion, and led to Kogălniceanu&#x27;s imprisonment for a duration of five months. A member of the Chamber of Deputies for Ilfov County, he served as a &quot;rapporteur&quot; for the Alexandru Averescu executive during the 1921 debates regarding an extensive land reform.

Vasile&#x27;s sister Lucia (or Lucie) studied at a boarding school in Dresden during the late 1860s-early 1870s. Her third husband, Leon Bogdan, was a local leader of the Conservatives in Neamț County (according to the memoirist Constantin Argetoianu, Lucia was the one exercising real control over the organization&#x27;s branch). After the Conservative Party faded out of politics as a result of World War I, she came to support the People&#x27;s Party. Argetoianu later speculated that she was the most intelligent of the Kogălniceanu children, and claimed that Mihail Kogălniceanu had himself acknowledged this (quoting him as saying, &quot;too bad Lucie is not a boy&quot;). She was the mother of eight; one of her daughters, Manuela, married into the Ghica family.

Kogălniceanu&#x27;s nephew, Grigore, himself a local leader of the Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, a member of the Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large collection of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).

===Landmarks and portrayals===
Mihail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s residence in Iași is kept as a memorial house and public museum. His vacation house in the city, located in Copou area and known locally as &quot;Casa cu turn&quot; (&quot;The House with a Tower&quot;), was the residence of composer George Enescu for part of the Romanian Campaign, and, in 1930, was purchased by the novelist Mihail Sadoveanu (in 1980, it became a museum dedicated to Sadoveanu&#x27;s memory). The Kogălniceanu property in Râpile, Bacău County, was sold and divided during the early 20th century.

Chronicles edited by Kogălniceanu and Costache Negruzzi were the source of inspiration for several historical novelists, beginning with Alexandru Odobescu. His relationship with the peasant representative to the ad hoc Divan, Ion Roată, is briefly mentioned in an anecdote authored by Ion Creangă (&quot;Moș Ion Roată&quot;). He is also the subject of a short writing by Ion Luca Caragiale (first published by &quot;Vatra&quot; in 1894). Symbolist poet Dimitrie Anghel, whose father, the National Liberal parliamentarian Dimitrie A. Anghel, had been well acquainted with Kogălniceanu, authored a memoir detailing the fluctuating relationship between the two political figures, as well as detailing one of the former Premier&#x27;s last speeches.

Kogălniceanu is the subject of many paintings, and features prominently in Costin Petrescu&#x27;s fresco at the Romanian Athenaeum (where he is shown alongside Cuza, who is handing a deed to a peasant). In 1911, Iași became host to Kogălniceanu bronze statue by Raffaello Romanelli, purported to have been recast from one of the sculptor&#x27;s older works. In 1936, the &quot;Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation&quot; commissioned Oscar Han to create a monument dedicated to Kogălniceanu, which was erected in Bucharest during the same year. Actors have portrayed Kogălniceanu in several Romanian films—most notably, Ion Niculescu in the 1912 &quot;Independența României&quot;, and George Constantin in Sergiu Nicolaescu&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Războiul Independenței&quot;. During the latter stages of the Romanian Communist regime, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, Mihail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s image was present in official propaganda, alongside those of other historical figures who were considered progressive.

The historian&#x27;s name was given to several places and landmarks; these include downtown Bucharest&#x27;s Mihail Kogălniceanu Square (near the Izvor metro station, and housing Han&#x27;s sculpture) and Mihail Kogălniceanu Boulevard, the Mihail Kogălniceanu commune in Constanța County, the Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport (situated 26 km northwest of Constanța, and serving that city, the airport also houses a U.S. Military Forces base), and the Mihail Kogălniceanu University in Iași (the first private university in Moldavia, founded in 1990). In Lunéville, a plaque was dedicated to him by the French state.

<doc id="409512" wikidata="Q12684290" url="?curid=409512" title="Bridle Path, Toronto">
<text>The Bridle Path is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is characterized by large multimillion-dollar mansions and two to four acre (8,000 to 16,000 m2) lot sizes. It makes up part of Bridle Path–Sunnybrook–York Mills. Often referred to as &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot;, it is the most affluent neighbourhood in Canada, with an average household income of $936,137, as well as by property values with an average dwelling value of $2.24M.

Although &quot;The Bridle Path&quot; is in fact the name of a road in the area, the term generally applies to the neighbourhood as a whole. It is bounded by The Bridle Path on the north, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre on the south, Bayview Avenue on the west and Wilket Creek on the east. Few roads pass through the area, contributing to the area&#x27;s exclusivity. House prices in the Bridle Path are varied, but most are well in excess of a million dollars. It is a secluded neighbourhood, surrounded by the Don River Valley and lush parklands.

==History==

The Bridle Path was little more than farmland until 1929, when the Bayview Bridge was constructed across the steep (West Branch) Don River Valley. It was at that point that the area was first considered for residential development. Forsey Page, a Toronto-based land developer, envisioned the Bridle Path as an &quot;exclusive enclave of estate homes&quot; and he built the neighbourhood&#x27;s first home, a Cape Cod Colonial style home at 2 The Bridle Path. This house is credited as the catalyst for the development of the neighbourhood.

In 1937, developer E.P. Taylor, who designed the Don Mills community, purchased a large plot of land north of the Bridle Path. The estate, named &quot;Windfields&quot; by his wife, is occupied today by the Canadian Film Centre. The park through which Wilket Creek flows behind this parcel of land is known as &quot;Windfields Park&quot;. In the late forties, Taylor&#x27;s business partner George Montegu Black, Jr (father of Conrad Black) moved into the area and built a large mansion on Park Lane Circle. In an effort to control who his future neighbours would be, Black took over the company that owned the rolling farmland that was to become the Bridle Path, and set restrictions in place through the North York zoning by-law; only single-family dwellings could be built, and only on minimum lot sizes of . The area was subdivided into about 50 lots, each selling for $25,000 at the time, and through the Fifties it began to take shape.

In July 1948, Sunnybrook Military Hospital was opened to the south of the neighbourhood. The hospital was since reorganized into Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and has expanded to encompass much of Bridle Path&#x27;s southern boundary.

In the 1950s and 1960s, local architects such as James A. Murray, Jerome Markson, Brook and Banz, and Seligman &amp; Dick built many modern houses in the Bridle Path. Many of these have now been replaced with larger houses.

The Bridle Path has been home to prominent Toronto business people, celebrities, doctors, and engineers. Media mogul Moses Znaimer used to call the Bridle Path home, as did computer businessman Robert Herjavec. Former newspaper baron and convicted felon, businessman Conrad Black was owner of a familial residence until 2016 when he sold the 26 Park Lane Circle, North York for $16.5 million. Prince bought a house in the Bridle Path in the early 2000s. &quot;Casino King of Macau&quot; Stanley Ho bought a house in the Bridle Path in 1987 for a then-high $5.5 million. Rapper Drake had a house built there for him in the late 2010s, after an older building had been demolished.

A location in the Bridle Path was used in the movie &quot;Mean Girls&quot; as Regina George&#x27;s house and another house was used for the movie &quot;It Takes Two&quot;.

==Education==

Two public school boards operate elementary schools in Bridle Path, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). TCDSB operates St. Bonaventure Catholic School, and TDSB operates Park Lane Public School. Neither school board operates a secondary school in the neighbourhood; secondary schools for both TCDSB and TDSB are in adjacent neighbourhoods.

Two French first language public school boards also provides schooling for applicable residents of Bridle Path, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and the separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM). Neither operates a school in the neighbourhood, with CSV and CSCM students attending schools in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

The neighbourhood has one public post-secondary institution, Glendon College. The college is a federated campus of York University, operating as a bilingual liberal arts college.

In addition to public institutions, the neighbourhood is also home to several private schools, including Crescent School, an elementary and secondary private school, and the Toronto French School (TFS).

==Recreation==

The neighbourhood includes several municipal parks and green spaces, including Edwards Gardens, Sunnybrook Park, and Windfields Park. Edwards Gardens is a botanical garden located in the east of the neighbourhood. Many of these parks are situated near the Don Valley, which forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system. Municipal parks in Bridle Path are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.

==Transportation==
Several major roadways pass through the neighbourhood, including Bayview Avenue, a north–south thoroughfare, and Lawrence Avenue, an east–west thoroughfare. The neighbourhood&#x27;s namesake comes from a residential road, The Bridle Path. The actual &quot;Bridle Path&quot; name came about as early plans for the neighbourhood included an elaborate system of equestrian bridle paths, as most of the estate owners in the area preceding its development were horse-owners.

Public transit is provided by Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), operating bus routes around the neighbourhood.

== Popular culture ==

* The neighbourhood is the namesake for resident Drake&#x27;s song “7am On Bridle Path” off his 2021 studio album &quot;Certified Lover Boy&quot;.

* The area is shown on the artwork for Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s single “Not Like Us”.

<text>Shota Rustaveli (, – after c. 1220), mononymously known simply as Rustaveli, was a medieval Georgian poet. He is considered to be the pre-eminent poet of the Georgian Golden Age and one of the greatest contributors to Georgian literature. Rustaveli was the author of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;, a Georgian national epic poem.

== Biography ==
Little, if anything, is known about Rustaveli from contemporary sources. Shota Rustaveli was born in 1166. He started serving Queen Tamar as a Minister of Finance in 1191. His poem itself, namely the prologue, provides a clue to his identity: the poet identifies himself as &quot;a certain Rustveli.&quot; &quot;Rustveli&quot; is not a surname, but a territorial epithet that can be interpreted as &quot;of/from/holder of Rustavi&quot;; although a 10th century manuscript fragment found in 1975 in Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in Sinai attests to its use as a cognomen by a noble house of Ru(i)staveli. Later Georgian authors from the 15th through 18th centuries are more informative; they are almost unanimous in identifying him as Shota Rustaveli, a name that is preserved on a fresco and a document from the formerly Georgian Monastery of the Holy Cross at Jerusalem. The fresco was described by the Georgian pilgrim Timote Gabashvili in 1757/58 and rediscovered by a team of Georgian scholars in 1960. The same Jerusalem document speaks of Shota as a sponsor of the monastery and a &quot;mechurchletukhutsesi&quot; (&quot;high treasurer&quot;), echoing a popular legend that Rustaveli was a minister at Queen Tamar’s court and retired to the monastery at an advanced age.

Both a folk tradition and the 17th-century royal poet Archil identify Rustaveli as a native of the southern Georgian region of Meskheti, where his home village Rustavi was located (in modern-day Aspindza Municipality, not to be confused with the modern-day city of Rustavi near Tbilisi). He is assumed to have been born between 1160 and 1165. A legend states that Rustaveli was educated at the medieval Georgian academies of Gelati and Ikalto, and then in &quot;Greece&quot; (i.e., the Byzantine Empire). He must have produced his major work no earlier than the 1180s and no later than the first decade of the 13th century, most probably 1205-1207. Shota Rustaveli died between 1245 and 1250.

Rustaveli was well acquainted with Persian &quot;and was therefore able to read and appreciate its poetry without having to resort to faulty translations&quot;. Rustaveli may have composed Persian verse as well.

==&quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;==
&quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; has been translated into many languages. It was first printed in 1712 in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. The manuscripts of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; occupy an important place among the works produced in Georgia.

Two folios of this text, dating from the 16th century, are located in the Georgian National Center of Manuscripts in Tbilisi, and some lines of the poem from the 14th century are also held there. All other copies of the poem date from the 17th century.

==Rustaveli mural portrait in Jerusalem==

The only known contemporary portrait of Shota Rustaveli was painted on the eastern face of the southwest pillar of the church of the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem. It is set at the foot of two much larger images of saints and is accompanied by a Georgian-language inscription.

The portrait was vandalized in June 2004 by an unknown perpetrator, who scratched out Rustaveli&#x27;s face and part of the accompanying Georgian inscription with his name. Georgia officially complained to Israel after the priceless fresco was defaced. The portrait and inscription have been restored.

==Legacy==
The highest Georgian state prize in the fields of art and literature is the Shota Rustaveli State Prize. Tbilisi&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Rustaveli Avenue. In Tbilisi, one can also find the Rustaveli Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli Institute of Georgian Literature of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences, the Shota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport and the Rustaveli metro station, among many other landmarks bearing his name.

Rustaveli has been featured on the 100 Georgian lari bill since the introduction of the currency in 1995. In 2001 Israel and Georgia jointly issued postage stamps to honor Shota Rustaveli.

Streets in a number of cities in the former Soviet Union are named after Rustaveli, including in Moscow, Saint Petersburg (Russia), Kyiv, Lviv (Ukraine), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Yerevan, Gyumri (Armenia), and elsewhere, such as pathway in Jerusalem, which leads to the Monastery of the Cross.

Mihály Zichy, a 19th-century Hungarian painter, rose to the rank of &quot;national painter&quot; in Georgia as he produced the classic illustrations that have been frequently used in editions of Rustaveli&#x27;s poetry. A sculpture and a street commemorate Zichy&#x27;s work in Tbilisi. Georgian composer Tamara Vakhvakhishvili set Rustaveli&#x27;s poetry to music in her composition &quot;Citation&quot; for voice and orchestra.

In November 2014, Mehndi was invited to Nigeria for a performance to celebrate Diwali. This was the second time the musician has performed in the country.

== Artistry ==
Mehndi is credited for creating a genre called &quot;Rabbabi&quot;, a combination of Thumri, Sufi, and rock and creating an instrument called &quot;Swar Mandir&quot; that combines influences from the Rabab, Swarmandal, and Tanpura. The instrument was crafted by Sanjay Rikhi Ram from Delhi and was launched on 10 February 2012 by the Indian classical music maestro, Bharat Ratna awardee Pandit Ravi Shankar.

==Business ventures==
Mehndi launched his maiden Record Label &#x27;DRecords&#x27; in the year 2000. The record label has several artists under its banner including Hussain Baksh and Safri Boys.

==Pop culture==
Mehndi&#x27;s &quot;Tunak Tunak Tun&quot; has found popularity on the internet as a viral video, with the official YouTube video gaining over 200 million views as of November 2022. The video game company Blizzard Entertainment incorporated the Tunak Tunak Tun dance as a character animation in their multiplayer role playing game World of Warcraft. This dance is also included as an easter egg in the video game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault: Spearhead.

====Charitable causes====
Mehndi has performed for charity for Imran Khan&#x27;s Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust in Pakistan and helped raise $5 million. Mehndi supports charitable causes such as cancer, thalassemia, and AIDS, and has helped to bring up the homeless children of Kenya as well as famine-stricken families in Kalahandi in Orissa, India. He financially supported the families of Kargil martyrs by donating to the Indian government&#x27;s Kargil Victims&#x27; Relief Fund. Mehndi was one of the first celebrities to go and visit the soldiers at Kargil. Mehndi has constructed earthquake-resistant houses for the Gujarat earthquake victims; he donated money and performed to raise money for Gujarat cyclone and quake victims, and for police welfare funds. He has donated 10 million in Vadodara for the victims of the cyclone in the government aid fund. He took upon himself the reconstruction of a block devastated in the Gujarat quake in Doodhiya village.
Mehndi has set up a Daler Mehndi Food for Life Society in Chander Vihar, Delhi, where a 24-hour kitchen provides food to the destitute and the underprivileged. Mehndi has constructed a Gurudwara Dukh Bhanjani Sahib where every morning people from all castes and religions join together and offer service in the name of god. Mehndi is the only known Indian artist to be invited by the President of Pakistan as a state guest. He gifted his album &quot;Bismillah&quot; to the President Zardari of Pakistan and the funds generated from its sale were given to the President&#x27;s charitable fund.

Mehndi voiced his protest against the International Basketball Federation&#x27;s (FIBA) controversial ruling on the use of turbans while playing. The singer made a video to raise awareness about the issue and to have the policy changed.

===Politics===
He entered in politics by joining Bharatiya Janata Party on 26 April 2019.

==Human trafficking conviction==
Mehndi and six others were accused in 2003 of cheating people of large sums of money by falsely promising to take them to America. In March 2018, Mehndi was sentenced to two years in prison by Patiala court in a human trafficking case. The singer and his brother Shamsher were charged for illegally sending people abroad as a part of their dance troupes. Daler was arrested after registration of the case and released on bail after a few days. Mehndi said he will appeal against the conviction in a higher court.

The Patiala court dismissed his appeal in 2022 and upheld the two year imprisonment, but shortly thereafter his sentence was suspended by the Punjab and Haryana high court and Mehndi was granted bail in September 2022.

<text>The Brazilian Communist Party (), originally the Communist Party of Brazil (), is a communist party in Brazil, founded on 25 March 1922. Arguably the oldest active political party in Brazil, it played an important role in the country&#x27;s 20th-century history despite the relatively small number of members. A factional dispute led to the formation of PCdoB (Communist Party of Brazil) in the 1960s, though both communist parties were united in opposition to the Brazilian military government that ruled from 1964 to 1985. But with the fall of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism circa 1990, the party lost power and international support. An internal coup in 1992 divided the party and formed a new party, called Popular Socialist Party, using the former identification number of the PCB, 23. That party has since moved towards the centre and now goes by the name Cidadania.

The youth organization of the PCB is the Communist Youth Union and is a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

==History==
===Foundation===
The Brazilian Communist Party (in Portuguese, &quot;Partido Comunista Brasileiro&quot;), abbreviated as the PCB, was founded on 25 March 1922 in the city of Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. On that day, nine representatives of communist groups from the cities of São Paulo, Santos, Cruzeiro, Porto Alegre, Recife, Niterói, Juiz de Fora and Rio de Janeiro met and approved the party&#x27;s statutes and the twenty-one conditions for entering the Communist International, though the PCB was not recognized by the Comintern in its first years due to its eclectic ideological roots. The meeting ended with all seventy-three members of the party singing L&#x27;Internationale.

===Early years===
The PCB&#x27;s first years were marked by an effort to encourage socialist thinking in Brazil. There had been moderate socialist parties, newspapers and congresses, but much unlike the strong social-democratic parties that existed in many European countries. The radical anti-capitalist thinking had been dominated by anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists, who also dominated the labour movement, such as in the case of the 1917 anarchist actions in São Paulo. Inspired by the Russian Revolution, a group of former anarchist militants who were disappointed in the lack of unity and force of the movement, turned communist and started the PCB. At the same time, some other figures from Brazil&#x27;s early labour and socialist movements became inspired by forms of military and authoritarian populism, like the tenentes, that eventually led to the Vargas-revolution of 1930.

During the first years, the party was declared illegal by the government. On 1 May 1925, during the party&#x27;s Second Congress, its weekly newspaper &quot;A Classe Operária&quot; (&quot;The Working Class&quot;) was announced, with five thousand copies being sold on the factories. This number grew to nine thousand copies by the ninth edition, but the police shut the newspaper down shortly after the twelfth edition was published. The paper reappeared in 1928, after the Third Congress was held.

By 1930, after being recognized by the Communist International and with its Socialist Youth division formed, the PCB had nearly eleven hundred members. This marks the beginning of a long period of submission to, initially the Third International, and, after its dissolution, to the political leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This decade also marked two cycles on the party&#x27;s history: one of increasing influence, until 1935, and one of decline, until 1942. Both cycles are comprehensible when seen in the context of the Vargas era.

===Reorganization and growth===
In 1943, during the so-called &quot;Mantiqueira Conference&quot;, the party secretly met in the small city of Engenheiro Passos, Rio de Janeiro, and in an open letter to Vargas decided to support a declaration of war on the Axis. At the same time, Luís Carlos Prestes was elected to the party&#x27;s presidency. In 1945, after Vargas&#x27;s dictatorship ended, the PCB became legal once again. By 1947, it had nearly two hundred thousand members. In the 1947 legislative election, it received 480,000 votes or about 9% of total votes cast. However, this period of official tolerance did not last long, as President Dutra denounced the PCB as &quot;internationalist, and therefore not committed to Brazil&#x27;s own interests&quot; in 1948, an action supported by the American government.

In the 1950s, as the party was driven underground, it began supporting major workers&#x27; strikes around Brazil. However, this did not prevent the beginning of internal clashes between different factions within the PCB. This became more evident after the Soviet Communist Party&#x27;s 20th Congress, when Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin&#x27;s policies. The factionalization of the party accelerated after a new Manifesto was passed in 1958, proposing new ways of achieving communist goals. This Manifesto linked the establishment of socialism to the broadening of democracy. Some of its top leaders, dissatisfied with the new Soviet line, quit the PCB and formed a new party, Communist Party of Brazil (&quot;Partido Comunista do Brasil&quot; – PCdoB) in 1962.

In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the number of organized communists in Brazil to around 31,000.

===Military rule years===
With this new orientation, the PCB grew in size and exercised a much greater role in the Brazilian left. However, the alliance forged with the other parties did not survive the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état. PCB did play an important role against the dictatorship, by organizing the workers movement and participating in efforts to unite the opposition in its demands for democratic reforms. At that point in time the communists were a fraction of the democratic opposition front, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). It refused, for example, to engage in armed struggle, differently from other left wing organizations that decided to follow that path. The clandestine operations and the political disputes regarding the strategies to resist the military regime led to many important leaders leaving the party, while many others died in the hands of the military regime. To the end of the dictatorship, while the Communist Party in Brazil was involved in several internal clashes, the Worker&#x27;s Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores) was founded. Its creation was the project of a series of left wing groups independent from the PCB (Trotskyists, communist dissidents, ex-guerrillas, sectors of the Catholic Left, independent unionists and intellectuals). It was structured as an alternative to Communist-led unionism in Brazil. Forswearing the Popular Front strategy adopted by the PCB, the PT chose instead to take a more radical stance against the military regime and gained a strong presence in between high skilled workers and middle-class intellectuals. The growth of the PT accelerated the fragmentation process inside the PCB leading ultimately to a big split.

===Crisis and formation of the PPS===
After the 1979 amnesty, the PCB&#x27;s leaders began to restructure the party. The 1982 Congress confirmed its democratic agenda, declaring the PCB &quot;a party of the masses, linking socialist goals to true democracy, which will be constructed based on the values of freedom&quot;. Once again, internal clashes developed in the party, as it was passing through a process of renewal while its influence in society declined. The fall of the Eastern Bloc was also a strong blow to the party, turning the renewal process into one where Marxism began to be abandoned by party leaders. This crisis reached its high point in January 1992.

A group led by the then-President Roberto Freire called its 10th Congress despite a Congressional resolution which had been passed a year earlier that the party would not call a congress for that year and that determined that the party would be kept. Nevertheless, Freire managed to organize it and allow people who were not members of the party to vote. That congress voted to dissolve the PCB and refound it as the democratic socialist Socialist People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Partido Popular Socialista&quot; – PPS), in a way similar to what had transpired in Italy.

However a small group, led by Ivan Pinheiro, questioning the legality of the 10th Congress, decided to keep the party Marxist–Leninist.

===Refoundation and reorganization===
After the dissolution of the PCB, decided by the 10th Congress, the Central Committee minority that was opposed to this action organized an &quot;Extraordinary Reorganization Conference&quot;, where it decided to rebuild the party with the maintaining of its identity and by reviewing the path that it had followed in the precedent years. The party then started a battle in order to gain the rights to use the name Brazilian Communist Party and the acronym PCB (which was contested by the members of the PPS) and to legalize the party. In 1996, the PCB would be officially registered.

The party has realized four congresses since then: the 10th (1993), 11th (1996), 12th (2000), and the 13th (2006). It remains small, in spite of some recent growth during the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the crisis of PT (it should be noticed that the main result of this process was the Socialism and Liberty Party). Although competing in elections and participating in wider electoral fronts, its electoral results were insignificant.

In 2006, the PCB agreed on a nationwide alliance with two other left-wing parties, PSOL and PSTU. Putting aside some significant ideological differences, the three parties built a common agenda to try to break the polarity between presidential candidates Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) and Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB). The coalition also extended to gubernatorial and parliament elections to take place at the same time all over the country. The PCB elected a state deputy (Jorge Souza, in the state of Amapá) and has about 20 local representatives.

The party&#x27;s union branch currently builds the central Intersindical and is growing greatly in the union movement. The student movement is responsibility of the Young Communist Union, which is also growing in size.

The last party&#x27;s Congress, the 13th, in 2005, voted to abolish the post of &quot;president&quot; and use only the traditional position of &quot;General Secretary&quot;.

==Electoral results==

===Presidential elections===
===Parliamentary elections===

 The 1947 elections had just a complementary character at the federal level (since the deputies elected in 1945 had mandates until 1950) and elected the State Chambers according to the new Constitution. The PCB elected 46 state deputies and become a major party in the Federal District (at this time, the city of Rio de Janeiro).
 The party didn&#x27;t launch any candidates to the Senate, choosing to support other parties&#x27; candidates, following the party tactics of a &quot;democratic front&quot;.

<text>Harbhajan Singh (born 3 July 1980), also known by his nickname Bhajji, is a former Indian cricketer. He later became a politician, serving as a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. He is also a film actor, a television celebrity and a cricket commentator.

Harbhajan played for India from 1998 to 2016 as an off spin bowler. In domestic cricket, he played for Punjab cricket team; and in the Indian Premier League for Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, and Kolkata Knight Riders. Considered one of the best Indian spin bowlers of his era, he was in the Indian teams that won the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and also their team that were joint-winners with Sri Lanka of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy . He was also a handy lower order batter, even scoring 2 centuries in tests with a top score of 115.

==Early years and personal life==
Harbhajan is the only son of Sardar Sardev Singh Plaha, a Sikh Freedom Fighter who owned a ball bearing and valve factory. Growing up with five sisters, Harbhajan was in line to inherit the family business, but his father insisted that he concentrate on his cricket career and represent India.

Harbhajan was trained as a batsman by his first coach Charanjit Singh Bhullar, but converted to spin bowling after his coach&#x27;s untimely death saw him turn to the tutelage of Davinder Arora. Arora credits Harbhajan&#x27;s success to a work ethic that included a three-hour training session in the morning, followed by an afternoon session lasting from 3 pm until after sunset.

Following the death of his father in 2000, Harbhajan became the family head, and by 2001 had organised marriages for three of his sisters. In 2002 he ruled out his own marriage until at least 2008. In 2005 he again fended off marriage rumours linking him to a Bangalore-based bride, stating that he would only make a decision &quot;after a couple of years&quot;, and that he would be seeking a Punjabi bride selected by his family. In a country where cricketers are idolised, Harbhajan&#x27;s performances have brought him government accolades and lucrative sponsorships. Following his performance against Australia in 2001, the Government of Punjab awarded him , a plot of land, and an offer to become a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab Police, which he did not comply (accept) later.

Despite having a job offer with the constabulary, Harbhajan sustained minor injuries in March 2002 in an altercation with police outside the team hotel in Guwahati. The scuffle broke out when Harbhajan remonstrated with officers after they refused to allow a photographer into the hotel. Harbhajan cut his bowling arm and injured his elbow when he was struck by the police. Extensive negotiations from local officials and organisers were required to dissuade Harbhajan and captain Sourav Ganguly from leaving the area after Ganguly said that the Indian team would abandon the scheduled match against Zimbabwe.

Harbhajan was caught at Auckland airport for failing to declare that he had filthy boots in his luggage. His only excuse was that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered&quot; complying with New Zealand quarantine laws. He was fined $200 on the spot.

One of his common nicknames, outside India, is &quot;The Turbanator&quot;, deriving from his skill as a bowler in terminating the innings of the opposing team, and the fact that, as a Sikh, he wears a turban whenever he plays. Among Indians, Harbhajan is more commonly known as &quot;bhajji&quot;. It was estimated in 2005 that Harbhajan was the most recognised and commercially viable Indian cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar, in part due to his colourful personality and iconic turban, as well as his reputation for enjoying the celebrity social scene. His signing for English county team Surrey in 2005, based at The Oval in London, was partly attributed to his marketability. Harbhajan had generated a large personal following in the western London suburb of Southall, which boasts a majority Punjabi Sikh population, when he lived there in 1998 while training under Fred Titmus.
In 2006 Harbhajan&#x27;s endorsements generated controversy when he appeared without his turban in an advertisement for Royal Stag whisky. This angered many orthodox Sikhs, leading to anti-Harbhajan protests in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, with effigies of Harbhajan being burnt. The Sikh clergy and Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee demanded an apology from him and asked Seagram&#x27;s to withdraw the advert, on the basis that it had &quot;hurt the feelings of Sikhs&quot;. Harbhajan quickly issued an apology, but he was also unhappy at the clergy&#x27;s interference, stating &quot;If they were unhappy, they should have called me and talked to me like a son&quot;. Harbhajan was also a brand ambassador for eBikeGo.

Harbhajan married his longtime girlfriend, actress Geeta Basra, on 29 October 2015 in Jalandhar. They have a daughter, born on 27 July 2016, and a son, born on 10 July 2021.

==Domestic career==
Harbhajan broke into the Punjab Under-16s at the age of 15 years and 4 months in November of the 1995–96 season, and took 7/46 and 5/138 on debut against Haryana, setting up a nine-wicket win. He scored 56 in his next match against Delhi and then took 11/79 in his third match against Himachal Pradesh, orchestrating an innings win. He ended with 32 wickets at 15.15 and 96 runs at 48.00 in four matches. He was rewarded with selection for North Zone Under-16s, a team that represents all of northern India for a one-day series, in which he took two wickets at 43.50 in four matches and scored 18 runs. At the end of the season, he was called into the national Under-19 team at the age of 15 years and 9 months for a youth One Day International against South Africa. He took 1/19 from seven overs in an Indian win.

In 1996–97, Harbhajan was promoted to the Punjab Under-19s and he took 15 wickets at 20.20 in three matches, although he managed only two runs with the bat. This included match figures of 8/54 in an innings win over Jammu and Kashmir.

Harbhajan made his first-class cricket debut in late 1997 against Services, during the 1997–98 Ranji Trophy season. He took a total of 3/35 in an innings win but was dropped back to the Under-19s the following week. He then took 5/75 and 7/44 in two matches to earn a recall to the senior team. He then took a total of 7/123 in the next two matches for Punjab to earn selection for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy.

Harbhajan&#x27;s season was interrupted when he represented India at the Under-19 World Cup in January 1998. He played in six matches, taking eight wickets at 24.75 with a best of 3/5 against Kenya.

After returning to India, he played in three more Ranji Trophy matches, and from a total of six matches, he took 18 wickets at an average of 22.50, ranking outside the top 20 in wicket taking. He took a total of 5/131 as North lost to East Zone by five wickets.

Harbhajan played the full 2009 Indian Premier League season in South Africa, taking 12 wickets at 21.33 and an economy rate of 5.81 in 13 matches. He was one of the most economical bowlers in the competition, and took 1/9 in four overs against Punjab to win the man of the match award. He ended the season with 4/17 against Delhi, but it was not enough to prevent a four-wicket defeat.

During the 2010 IPL season, he finished as the Mumbai Indian&#x27;s leading wicket taker with 17 victims at an average of 22.17 helping his team to reach the final. Harbhajan opened the bowling during the final vs Chennai Super Kings but went wicketless and was promoted as a pinch hitter to number 4 in the batting order but could only contribute 1 run in the defeat.

Harbhajan had a largely successful 2011 IPL as part of an effective Mumbai Indians bowling attack. He took 5 for 18 against Chennai Super Kings during the round robin part of the tournament which are the best bowling figures of any player at the Wankhede Stadium in the IPL However, the team&#x27;s form faltered during the playoffs as they lost back to back matches to Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings to miss out on the final.

After injuries, he returned to competitive cricket to lead the Mumbai Indians to 2011 Champions League Twenty20 title, but fell out of favor with the national selectors. He was not chosen in the home series squad against England in October and West Indies in November and December. Mumbai Indians won their first ever championship under his captaincy, winning the Champions League by 31 runs. Harbhajan was man of the match for his contribution.

He went on to play the 2012 IPL which was not that successful for him, but took his team to the semi-final while being captain. Harbhajan went to play for Essex in England but is not selected for the Sri Lankan tour before the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In his debut match for Essex against Gloucestershire, Harbhajan did not take any wicket on 12 July 2012, conceding 33 runs in his 12 overs. He was bought by Chennai Super Kings in 2018 after 10 years with Mumbai Indians. On 20 January 2021 Harbajan announced his contract ended with Chennai Super Kings. He was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders during the 2021 IPL auction for a sum of 2 crore

Harbhajan Singh is the captain of Manipal Tigers team in Legends League Cricket, who also won the 2023 title.

===Doorstep to international arena===
After taking eight wickets in his next two Ranji matches, Harbhajan was selected to tour Australia in 1999–2000, as the second spinner. He did not play in the Tests, with India opting to field only Anil Kumble in the team. Australia whitewashed India 3–0, and Harbhajan struggled in his only first-class outing against Tasmania, taking 0/141, a portent of future unsuccessful tours to Australia.

Harbhajan was not part of the ODI squad for the Australian tour and upon returning to India in early 2000 needed strong first-class results to maintain his Test position. He went wicketless against Hyderabad, and was selected for the Board President&#x27;s XI match against the touring South Africans. He took 2/88 and 2/59 and scored 38 and 39 to prevent the hosts being bowled out and defeated, but was dropped as the second slow bowler, as Murali Kartik became Kumble&#x27;s spinning partner. Harbhajan returned to domestic action, taking 24 wickets in Punjab&#x27;s remaining four first-class matches. He ended the Indian season with 46 first-class wickets at 26.23.

In mid-2000 an opportunity arose when Harbhajan was selected in the first group of trainees sent to the National Cricket Academy to study under Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, two off spin bowlers from the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s. However, his behaviour did not conform to requirements, and he was expelled on disciplinary grounds. His sponsorship job with Indian Airlines was also reviewed as a result of his indiscipline. Harbhajan later admitted that he had been at fault earlier in his career.

Following his run-ins with Indian cricket administrators, there was nothing to indicate that Harbhajan&#x27;s chances of national selection had improved at the start of 2000–01. Despite Kumble being injured, Harbhajan was again overlooked as Kartik, Sunil Joshi, and debutant Sarandeep Singh were entrusted with the spin bowling duties in Test matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the subcontinent.

During the first half of the season, still in international exile, Harbhajan continued to pick up wickets on the domestic circuit. In five Ranji Trophy matches, he claimed 28 wickets at 13.96. He claimed 3/29 and 3/39 against Himachal Pradesh, 2/53 and 5/88 against Jammu and Kashmir, 4/77 and 2/33 against Haryana and 5/40 against Services in the first four matches, all of which ended in innings wins for Punjab. He then took a total of 4/32 in a 199-run win over Delhi. Harbhajan&#x27;s batting, which had rarely been productive up to this point in his career, also improved. He scored a career-best 84 against Haryana and added 52 against Services, aggregating 207 runs at 51.75. After taking eight wickets at 21.12 in six one-dayers, Harbhajan was selected for North in the Duleep Trophy, but his early-season form deserted him. He took five wickets at 39.00 in two matches, although he did continue his productive run with the bat, scoring 130 runs at 32.50 with three scores above 35. In October 2019, Harbhajan drafted his name into the Hundred at a base price of $100,000, risking his international retirement.

==International career==
===Debut days===
Despite the superior statistics of other bowlers in domestic cricket, Harbhajan was the selected for the Indian Board President&#x27;s XI to play the touring Australian cricket team ahead of the Tests. He managed only 1/127, and was ignored for the first two Tests before being selected to make his Test debut in the Third Test against Australia in Bangalore, where he scored 4 not out and a duck, and recorded the modest match figures of 2/136 as Australia won the match by eight wickets. He was subsequently overlooked for the triangular ODI tournament in India that followed the Tests, involving Zimbabwe in addition to Australia, but was selected for all group matches in the triangular tournament that followed soon after in Sharjah, where he made his ODI debut against New Zealand. He took 1/32 from ten overs on debut as India narrowly won by 15 runs. He then took 3/41 in the next match, a defeat against Australia, but then struggled in the second qualifying match against the same team, taking 1/63 in eight overs. He was subsequently dropped for the final against Australia, which India won, and ended the series with five wickets at 33.20 at an economy rate of 4.36.

===1997– Struggling form===
Having made little success in this phase of his international career, averaging 37.75 per Test wicket to date, and overlooked by selectors, Harbhajan faced a difficult decision. His father had recently died; as the family&#x27;s only son, Harbhajan was now obliged to support his mother and unmarried sisters. He contemplated quitting cricket and moving to the United States to drive trucks for a living. After being out of the team for more than 12 months, there was little overt indication of the sudden rise that would occur in his cricketing career only a few months later.

Harbhajan was then omitted from the team during a home triangular ODI tournament against Bangladesh and Kenya, after taking 0/18 from four overs in his only match of the tournament against the former opponent, but was recalled for the Singer Trophy in Sri Lanka and also involving New Zealand. Playing in all five matches, Harbhajan claimed eight wickets at an average of 24.12 and economy of 4.38 in this tournament, taking at least one scalp in each match. Harbhajan was retained for the final and took 1/57, his worst return for the series, in an Indian win. After being omitted for the Sahara Cup series against Pakistan in Toronto, Harbhajan played in a weakened Indian team at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The matches were not given ODI status by the ICC, and India chose to send their better players to the Sahara Cup instead. India won their first two matches against Antigua and Canada, but Harbhajan managed only a total of 1/48 from 11 overs. The Indians then needed to beat a full-strength Australian outfit to win their group and progress to the semi-finals. Harbhajan was punished and went wicketless, conceding 50 runs in eight overs as Australia won by 146 runs, knocking India out of contention.

===Recall to the team===
Harbhajan was then recalled to the first-choice team and took five wickets at an average of 22.60 at 3.89 runs an over from three matches on a tour to Zimbabwe, in what would prove to be his last ODI appearances for India for more than two years. In all, he took 18 ODI wickets at an average of 27.2 during the 1998.

After taking 2/38 and 3/60 in an innings win in a tour match, Harbhajan was retained in the Test team, taking 2/42 and 3/63 in the only Test on the Zimbabwe tour. He was unbeaten on 15 in the second innings as the final wicket fell and India succumbed to a 51-run defeat.

Returning to India, Harbhajan started the 1998–99 domestic season well, taking 3/54 and 5/39 in an innings win over Services, before following up with 6/69 and 1/93 in the next match against Delhi, claiming his first five-wicket innings haul. He then took 6/63 and scored 31 in the first innings of a match for the Board PResident&#x27;s XI against a touring West Indies A, and was taken on the tour of New Zealand in December. In a tour match against Central Districts, Harbhajan struggled, aggregating 2/112. He only played in one Test during the tour, and went wicketless, conceding 72 runs. Upon returning to India, he took a total of 3/158 for India A in a match against the touring Pakistanis ahead of the Tests. After being omitted for the First Test lost in Chennai, he was recalled for the latter two matches against Pakistan, and took five wickets at 34.60 as the matches were split. He then took 3/127 in a high-scoring draw against Sri Lanka. In all, he claimed 13 wickets at an average of 36.8 in five Tests for the season. When he was free of international fixtures for the season, he played in the Ranji Trophy matches, claiming 27 wickets at an average of 24.59 in five matches, including his first five-wicket haul at first-class level. He also registered his maiden first-class fifty, scoring an unbeaten 67 against Tamil Nadu cricket team.

Harbhajan took four wickets at 33.00 during the one-dayers during the season and was overlooked for the ODI team for the whole season and missed selection for the 1999 Cricket World Cup. In September 2003, he played for India A in a one-day series against their Australian counterparts in Los Angeles. Harbhajan took eight wickets at 17.00 at 3.77 runs an over in the five matches, with a best of 3/38.

After taking 4/91 against the touring team for the Board President&#x27;s XI at the start of the season, Harbhajan managed to retain his Test position for the late 1999 home series against New Zealand, as India fielded a three-pronged spin attack on dusty tracks, taking six wickets at an average of 32.66 as the hosts prevailed 1–0 in the two Tests.

===2001 Border-Gavaskar Trophy===

With Kumble injured before the home series in March 2001 against the visiting Australians, Harbhajan, whose previous best Test figures were only 3/30, was the only capped spinner in the Indian team for the First Test. He had been recalled after captain Sourav Ganguly publicly called for his inclusion in the team. He was to lead the spin attack against an Australian team which had set a world record with 16 consecutive Test victories, and was searching for its first series victory on Indian soil since 1969. In a warm-up match for India A, Harbhajan had taken 2/63 and 3/81 against the tourists. Harbhajan started well in the First Test in Mumbai, taking three quick wickets in a spell of 3/8, to reduce Australia to 99/5 in response to India&#x27;s first innings of 176. However, a counter-attacking 197-run partnership between Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist in just 32 overs, saw Harbhajan concede 103 runs from his last 17 overs, to end with 4/121. Despite being struck for many sixes into the crowd, it was still Harbhajan&#x27;s best statistical analysis at Test level. Australia eventually proceeded to a crushing 10-wicket victory, their sixteenth consecutive Test victory in succession. This test match has been called by many the greatest that has ever been played, in light of the nature of India&#x27;s win under difficult circumstances.

With leading paceman Javagal Srinath ruled out of the series with a finger injury during the First Test, the teams met for the Second Test in Kolkata, with an even bigger burden on Harbhajan. Public opinion was skeptical about India&#x27;s chances of stopping Australia&#x27;s winning streak, with former captain Bishan Bedi lamenting the demise of Indian cricket. Australia were again in control on the first day, having scored 193/1, with Hayden having struck Harbhajan out of the attack. Harbhajan fought back to reduce Australia to 252/7, taking five wickets in the final session, including Ricky Ponting, Gilchrist and Shane Warne in successive balls to become the first Indian to claim a Test hat-trick. After a prolonged wait for the third umpire to adjudicate whether Sadagoppan Ramesh had managed to catch Warne before the ball hit the ground, the near-capacity crowd at Eden Gardens erupted when he was given out. Harbhajan eventually finished with 7/123 as Australia were bowled out for 445. India batted poorly and were forced to follow-on, but a 376-run partnership between V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid, who batted together for an entire day, allowed India to set Australia an imposing target of 384 to win on the final day. Australia appeared to be safely batting out the match for a draw, until losing 7/56 in the final session, collapsing from 166/3 to be bowled out for 212. Harbhajan claimed four of the wickets, to finish with 6/73 for the innings and a match tally of 13/196. India ended Australia&#x27;s 16-match world record winning streak, and became only the third team to win a Test after being forced to follow on (Australia having lost all three of those matches).

The teams arrived in Chennai for the deciding Third Test, and Australia&#x27;s batsmen again seized control after winning the toss, reaching 340/3 on the second morning. Then, Australian captain Steve Waugh padded away a delivery from Harbhajan. The ball spun back into Waugh&#x27;s stumps, who pushed the ball away with his glove, becoming only the sixth batsman in Tests to be given out &quot;handled the ball&quot;. Waugh&#x27;s dismissal instigated another Australian batting collapse, losing 6 wickets for 51 runs to be bowled out for 391, with Harbhajan taking all six in a spell of 6/26, to finish with 7/133. After India&#x27;s batsmen gained a first-innings lead of 110, the Australian batsmen were again unable to cope with Harbhajan in the second innings, who took 8/84 to end with match figures of 15/217. India appeared to be heading for an easy victory at 101/2 chasing 155, before losing 6/50 to be 151/8. Harbhajan walked to the crease, and struck the winning runs.

He was named man of the match and man of the series, having taken 32 wickets at 17.03 for the series, when none of his teammates managed more than three. The Wisden 100 study conducted by Wisden in 2002 rated all four of Harbhajan&#x27;s efforts in the Second and Third Tests in the top 100 bowling performances of all time, the most for any bowler. He paid tribute to his father, who had died just six months earlier. His performance led to him usurping Anil Kumble&#x27;s position as India&#x27;s first-choice spinner.

===Poor form and returning===
Harbhajan&#x27;s Test success saw him recalled to the ODI team after more than two years. He was unable to reproduce his Test form against Australia, managing only four wickets at an average of 59.25 and economy rate of 5.04. His best performance was a 3/37 in a 118-run win in the third match, and a cameo batting performance of 46 runs from 34 balls, including three sixes, in a losing run chase in the fourth fixture. He was dropped from the ODI team during a subsequent triangular tournament in Zimbabwe in 2001 after only managing two wickets at 69.00 in four matches although he had been economical at 3.63 runs an over. Harbhajan was also unable to maintain his form in the Test series against Zimbabwe. Harbhajan began the tour well with 13 wickets in two warm-up matches, including a match haul of 10/80 against the CFX Academy, but could not repeat such performances in the Tests. He took eight wickets at 29.12 in the two-Test series, which was drawn 1–1, but did manage to post his first Test half-century, reaching 66 in the First Test in Bulawayo, before scoring 31 in the first innings of the Second Test as the Indian batsmen struggled and ceded their series lead. The Indians subsequently toured Sri Lanka in mid-2001, enjoying spinning wickets similar to those in India. Harbhajan managed to establish himself in the ODI team with eleven wickets at 21.18 at the low economy rate of 3.42 in seven matches in the ODI tournament with the hosts and New Zealand. Ironically however, his best performances, in which he conceded less than 30 runs in his ten overs three times, all ended in Indian defeats. In contrast to his ODI improvement, Harbhajan&#x27;s Test form deteriorated further, yielding only four wickets at 73.00 in three Tests, while Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was named man of the series with 23 wickets, in what was billed as a contest between the world&#x27;s two leading off-spinners. With the Tests locked at 1–1 Harbhajan managed only 2/185 in the Third Test as the hosts accumulated 6/610 declared and won by an innings. He scored 79 runs at 15.80 for the series.

Harbhajan was omitted from the Indian team in favour of Kumble as the first-choice spinner on the following tour of South Africa, only playing in the later matches when India fielded two spinners. Nevertheless, Harbhajan continued to do well in the ODIs, taking nine wickets at 20.44 in six matches at an economy rate of 3.53, winning his first man of the match award in the ODI form in an ODI against South Africa in Bloemfontein after taking 3/27 from his ten overs. He scored 62 runs at 15.50, including a rearguard 37 that was not enough to prevent an embarrassing 70-run loss to Kenya. After being omitted for the First Test, which India lost, his disciplinary problems continued when he was one of four Indian players fined and given a suspended one match suspension for dissent and attempting to intimidate the umpire by over-appealing in the Second Test. India managed to draw the match, but Harbhajan struggled and took 1/89 and 2/79. The off spinner continued his poor overseas Test form in what would have been the Third Test. However, India defied the ICC by playing banned batsman Virender Sehwag, while Mike Denness, the match referee who handed down the penalties, was locked out of the stadium, so the match was stripped of Test status. Harbhajan continued to be ineffective, taking only 1/104, although he showed resistance with the bat, scoring 29 and 30 when many specialist batsmen failed, as India slumped to an innings defeat.

Harbhajan&#x27;s Test fortunes improved immediately upon the start of the 2001–02 international season in India. Playing in his first international match at his home ground in Mohali, Punjab, Harbhajan took match figures of 7/110, including 5/51 in the first innings, to help India win the First Test by ten wickets against the touring English team. He continued his steady form throughout the series with another five wicket haul in the Second Test in Ahmedabad, to end with thirteen wickets at 24.53 for the series, although he went wicketless in 27.1 overs in the Third and final Test. Harbhajan&#x27;s good home form persisted in the Test matches against Zimbabwe, taking twelve wickets at 19.66 in two games. In the First Test, he took 4/46 in the second innings to seal an innings victory after going wicketless in the second innings. His 2/70 and 6/62 in the Second Test in Delhi saw him named man of the match in a Test for the second time in his career. As in the first instance, he hit the winning runs, a straight-driven six, after India had lost six wickets and threatened to collapse in pursuit of a modest 122 for victory. He also performed strongly in the ODIs during the Indian season, taking twenty wickets at 19.75 in ten matches and taking his first five wicket haul in ODIs. In the five matches against England, he took ten wickets at 20.10 at an economy rate of 4.27. His best result was a 5/43 in the last of these matches, but a late collapse handed the tourists a five-run win. He did better against the Zimbabweans, taking 10 wickets in five matches at an average of 19.40 and an economy rate of 4.06. This included a 4/33 in the final match. He also scored 39 runs without defeat for the series, including a 24 not out as India were skittled for 191 in one match. As Harbhajan was ensconced in the Indian team for the first team, he only played in two Ranji Trophy matches for Punjab, taking 13 wickets at 20.01 and scoring 71 runs at 17.75.

Harbhajan&#x27;s overseas difficulties returned during the tour of the West Indies in mid-2002. He injured his shoulder while fielding in a tour match in which he started well with a total of 5/70, and was forced to miss the First Test in Guyana. After taking only six wickets at 38 upon his return to the team for the Second and Third Tests, he was dropped for the Fourth Test, but was recalled again for the Fifth Test at Sabina Park, after Kumble was injured. Despite taking improved match figures of 8/180, including 5/138 in the first innings, Harbhajan was unable to prevent an Indian defeat after the batting collapsed in the first innings. He claimed three wickets in the three match ODI series at 33.00, conceding 4.71 runs per over.

Despite his performance at Sabina Park, Harbhajan was dropped again when Kumble returned for the First Test on the tour to England at Lord&#x27;s, where the hosts prevailed. India&#x27;s coach John Wright later admitted that Harbhajan&#x27;s omission had been a mistake. Harbhajan returned for the final three Tests with moderate success, taking 12 wickets at 34.16, improving as the English summer wore on. After claiming 3/175 in the drawn Second Test, he struck form in the tour match against Essex, taking 7/83 and 1/23. He then took 3/40 and 1/56 as India levelled the series in the Third Test at Headingley, before taking 5/115 in the first innings of the Fourth Test at The Oval, as well as managing his second Test half-century of 54 at Trent Bridge in the Second Test. He ended the series with 90 runs at 22.50. for the entire tour, Harbhajan aggregated 28 wickets at 27.60. Harbhajan had modest results in the Natwest Trophy. After being dropped after one wicketless match, he was dropped and then took 4/46 against Sri Lanka in the last match before the final to ensure his retention, but went wicketless in the decider, which India won. He played in three ODIs and took four wickets at 37.25 at 4.96.

===2002 Champions Trophy===
The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour brought moderate results with six wickets at 30.66 at an economy rate of only 3.68, and a best of 3/27 from ten overs in the firstwashed out final against the host nation. Harbhajan helped restrict Sri Lanka to 5/244, but rain ended proceedings with India at 0/14. He then took 1/34 the next day during a replay of the final. This time the hosts made 7/222 and a downpour again thwarted the players, with India at 1/38 when play was called off and the trophy shared.

As was the case in the previous season, Harbhajan&#x27;s return to Indian soil coincided with an improvement in results. He took 1/37 and 7/48 in an innings victory at Mumbai in the First Test against the West Indies, and then contributed match figures of 3/56, 4/79 and 37 in an eight-wicket victory in Chennai which saw him named man of the match. A haul of 5/115 in the Third Test at Calcutta was the best in a high scoring match, and with 20 wickets at 16.75 and 69 runs at 17.25, Harbhajan was named as the man of the series. He was unable to transfer his performances to the ODI format, taking only five wickets at 49.00 against the same team at an economy rate of 5.44. Harbhajan took only five wickets at 18.80 in the subsequent Test tour to New Zealand, in a series where five pace bowlers averaged less than 20 on green, seaming tracks. India lost the series 2–0 and Harbhajan&#x27;s 20 and 18 in the Second Test amounted for more than 15% of India&#x27;s match total. The off spinner then took 1/56 in one ODI before heading for his World Cup debut in South Africa.

===2003 World Cup===
Harbhajan had a mixed tournament at the 2003 Cricket World Cup, taking 11 wickets at 30.45 with an economy rate of 3.92 in ten matches. He was the first-choice spinner and played in all matches but one, being dropped for the victory against arch-rivals Pakistan in the group phase. His counterpart, Kumble, played in only three matches. Harbhajan was steady throughout the tournament, never taking more than two wickets in a match, and never conceding more than 42 runs from his quota of ten overs, except in the two matches against Australia, who went through the tournament without defeat. In the group match, Harbhajan was the second highest score, with a counter-attacking 28 as India collapsed for 125, but when it was his turn to bowl, the Australians attacked him and scored 49 runs from his 44 balls without losing a wicket in a decisive nine-wicket win. In the final, Ganguly elected to field and Harbhajan was the only Indian bowler to take a wicket, taking 2/49 from eight overs. In contrast, the Australians scored at 7.38 runs per over from the other bowlers to reach 2/359, the highest total in a World Cup final, and win by 125 runs. He was the fourth leading wicket taker for India overall and his tournament bowling average was worse than those of Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Javagal Srinath. He finished the season with six wickets at 14.00 at 3.65 runs per over in three matches in an ODI tournament in Bangladesh, where he was fined for abusing an umpire.

===Finger injury===
After experiencing pains in his spinning finger during the World Cup, Harbhajan was scheduled to undergo surgery in mid-2003 in Australia, but the surgery was delayed as he sought to play through the pain. He underwent physiotherapy in lieu of surgery and was declared fit for a two-match Test series at home against New Zealand in late 2003. His performance was substantially worse than his previous displays on Indian soil, taking only six wickets at an average of 50.00 as both matches ended in high-scoring draws. Aside from his debut series, it was his worst series bowling average on Indian soil. Despite a triangular ODI series against New Zealand and Australia in which he managed only four wickets at 40.50 in four matches and spent time in the sidelines, the Indian team attempted to manage his injury rather than have his finger operated on, and took him on the 2003–04 tour of Australia. As with his previous visit four years earlier, Harbhajan had an unhappy time, taking 2/159 in a tour match against Victoria. After an ineffective 1/169 in the First Test at Brisbane, his injury deteriorated and he underwent major finger surgery, sidelining him for a predicted five months. Kumble replaced him and took 24 wickets in the remaining three Tests in strak contrast of Harbhajan&#x27;s struggles in Australia. Kumble bowled India to victory in the following Test against Pakistan in Multan, taking 6/71 to reclaim his position as the No. 1 spinner.

After a seven-month layoff, Harbhajan returned to represent India in ODIs in the Asia Cup in July 2004, where he took four wickets at 39.75 in four matches at 3.97 runs per over. His performance improved on the tour to England for an ODI series against England and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, taking eight wickets at 14.00, conceding only 2.80 runs an over, including 3/28 against England and 3/33 against Kenya and hitting as an unbeaten 41 against England at The Oval as India&#x27;s batting collapsed to a substantial defeat.

Harbhajan made his Test return against Australia, who were again seeking their first series win on Indian soil since 1969 in the late 2004 home series. Harbhajan took 5/146 in the first innings and 6/78 in the second innings in addition to making a run out to reduce Australia from 103/3 to 228 all out. Despite this, India required 457 in their second innings to win, slumping to 125/8 before Harbhajan (42) and Irfan Pathan helped India to reach 239 after a rearguard counter-attack, still a 217-run loss. Harbhajan was less effective in the drawn Second Test in Chennai, with match figures of 5/198, which was washed out with India still needing 210 more runs on the last day with all ten wickets in hand. Harbhajan then withdrew from the Third Test in Nagpur due to illness. Australia won the match easily, clinching the series. Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai. After failing to take a wicket in the first innings, he claimed 5/29 in the second to help India bowl Australia out for 93 and claim a dramatic 14-run victory. Harbhajan ended the series with 21 wickets at 24.00 and 69 runs at 13.80.

A Test series in India against South Africa followed, with Harbhajan taking match figures of 4/166 in the drawn First Test in Kanpur, before producing a man of the match performance in the Second Test in Calcutta to lead India to a 1–0 series win. After taking 2/54 in the first innings, he took 6/78 in the second, including South Africa&#x27;s first five batsman to help dismiss the tourists for 222. This set up a run-chase of 117, which India reached with eight wickets in hand. Harbhajan was the leading wicket-taker for the series, with 13 victims at an average of 23.61. He ended 2004 with a quiet tour of Bangladesh, scoring a 47 in the Second Test and taking four wickets at 41.75 in two Tests and one wicket at 94 at an economy rate of 5.22 in two ODIs. He had a relatively light workload, bowling only 47.4 overs in the Tests, as Irfan Pathan frequently scythed through the Bangladeshi batsmen with the new ball, taking three five wicket hauls. He then returned to India and took a total of 6/172 in North Zone&#x27;s seven-wicket win over South.

His performance in Bangladesh saw him dropped for the First Test in the early 2005 series against Pakistan on his home ground in Mohali, with Kumble being the only spinner selected on the pace-friendly surface. India were in control of the match for four days, and needed only four wickets on day five, but were unable to break the Pakistani lower-order until play was almost over and the tourists had taken a lead, and the match ended in a draw. Harbhajan was recalled for the Second Test in Calcutta and took match figures of 4/145 in an Indian victory. Despite taking 6/152 in a marathon 51-over spell in the first innings of the Third Test in Bangalore, Pakistan won the match to level the series after India collapsed on the final day. Harbhajan finished the series with 10 wickets at 33.20. His performance in the subsequent ODI series was even worse, managing only three wickets at 73.66 in five matches at an economy rate of 4.80. In spite of the poor end to the season, his performance in the year since finger surgery in the long form of the game saw him nominated for the 2005 ICC Test Player of the Year. Harbhajan spent the international off-season playing for Surrey in English county cricket, citing the improvement that other international players had gained from such an experience. It was his first stint in county cricket, after a planned season at Lancashire in 2003 was cancelled due to injury. After taking six wickets in his opening two first-class fixtures, he struck form against Hampshire, taking 6/36 and 2/47 in an innings triumph. In is fourth and final first-class match, against Gloucestershire, Harbhajan took a total of 6/193 and equalled his previous first-class best of 84. He ended with 20 wickets at 25.85 and 124 runs at 31.00. In the Twenty20 competition, he had less success in the new format, taking four wickets at 38.00 at an economy rate of 6.60 in eight matches. In all he spent six weeks with the county.

===Chappell era===
Harbhajan&#x27;s first outings under newly appointed coach Greg Chappell came at the Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August 2005. He took five wickets at 31.40, conceding 4.02 runs per over in four matches, but was wicketless in the final, which was won by the host nation. This was followed by a tour of Zimbabwe, which was marred by tension between the new coach and Indian captain Ganguly. This broke into the public arena when Ganguly claimed that he was asked to resign as captain. Harbhajan played in all five matches in the Videocon Tri-Series involving Zimbabwe and New Zealand with little success, managing only two wickets at 99.00 at an economy rate of 4.77, both of them against an inexperienced Zimbabwe team crippled by a mass exodus of white players from the Mugabe regime. Harbhajan had a quiet Test series against Zimbabwe, taking six wickets at 31.00. He was only required to bowl 58 overs, as the majority of the Zimbabwean batsmen were removed after being unable to cope with Pathan&#x27;s swing which was likened to &quot;Frisbees at high speed&quot;, leaving little work for the spinners. He managed to claim his 200th Test wicket in the First Test, and in doing so became the second youngest player to reach the mark after Kapil Dev. Harbhajan&#x27;s batting was notable for an exceptionally aggressive 18-ball innings in the First Test in Bulawayo, where he struck four fours and three sixes in a cameo innings of 37.

Harbhajan&#x27;s difficulties were compounded when he earned the ire of cricket authorities by publicly attacking Chappell and defending Ganguly after the team returned to India. He claimed that Chappell had used &quot;double standards&quot; and instilled &quot;fear and insecurity&quot; into the team. The Punjab Cricket Association called him to explain his actions, but he was not punished after offering an apology. In early 2006, Harbhajan changed his stance publicly, praising Chappell for the team&#x27;s improved form, stating &quot;He has great knowledge about the game and it has been a very successful year for us under him. He has lifted our team to great heights&quot;.

Harbhajan was under pressure to perform when Sri Lanka toured India in late 2005 following his attack on Chappell and the replacement of Ganguly, who had frequently supported him during previous career difficulties, with new captain Rahul Dravid. In addition, his home ODI form had been poor in the previous three years, managing only 12 wickets at 56 in 16 matches, with an economy rate of 4.8. In the three Challenger Trophy matches at the start of the season, he took five wickets at 24.20 at an economy rate of 4.25. He responded by claiming 3/35 in the first ODI in Nagpur after Sri Lanka had raced to 50 in just 6.3 overs. The Sri Lankan batsmen hit the Indian fast bowlers out of the attack, scoring 74 runs in the first 10 overs and forcing Dravid to delay the Power Play and introduce Harbhajan. This sparked a collapse, with 4 wickets taken for 14 runs, resulting in a 152-run Indian victory. Harbhajan took 2/19 in the next match, and aggregated six wickets at 26 in the first four matches, at a low economy rate of 3.43, with a series of performances noted for skilful variations in pace and flight, helping India gain an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He was subsequently rested for the fifth ODI, and ended the series as the most economical bowler, conceding only 3.62 runs per over.

He put on another strong personal performance in the first ODI of the following series against South Africa in Hyderabad, where he struck an aggressive unbeaten 37 from 17 balls, including two sixes, to help India recover to 249/9, before taking 1/35 from his 10 overs. He was unable to prevent an Indian loss, and was fined after pointing Ashwell Prince to the pavilion after dismissing him. Harbhajan ended the series with five wickets at 27.40, and was again India&#x27;s most economical bowler, conceding 3.92 runs per over.

The year ended with a three Test series against Sri Lanka. After the first match in Chennai was washed out by monsoonal rains, Harbhajan took match figures of 4/137 as India took a 1–0 series lead in Delhi. He finished the calendar year with a man of the match performance in Ahmedabad, which saw India seal a 2–0 series victory with a 259 run victory. He took 7/62 in the first innings, including six of Sri Lanka&#x27;s top eight batsmen. He precipitated a middle-order batting collapse, with 6 wickets falling for 82 runs, which allowed India to take a 193-run first innings lead. Harbhajan later contributed an aggressive innings of 40 not out from 51 balls, in an unbroken 49-run final-wicket partnership with Kumble in the second innings, their display of unorthodox hitting stretching India&#x27;s lead to 508 runs. His prospects of a half century were cut short by a declaration from acting captain Virender Sehwag, but he was compensated with opening the bowling, as Sehwag employed a novel tactic of assigning the new ball to a spinner. He took 3/79 to finish with match figures of 10/141, ending the year on a high note after he had been embroiled in the leadership struggle only three months earlier.

===Test decline===

2006 began with Harbhajan&#x27;s first tour to arch-rivals Pakistan. The First Test was a high scoring draw held in Lahore, where Harbhajan recorded his worst ever Test figures of 0/176, conceding more than five runs an over in a match where 1,089 runs were scored for the loss of just eight wickets. In a match in which many batting records fell, Harbhajan was hit for 27 runs in one over by Shahid Afridi, just one short of the world record. The second Test in Faisalabad was another high scoring draw, with the aggregate runs being the fourth highest in Test history. Harbhajan took 0/101 and 0/78. His 81 overs in the series were the fourth highest number of overs in any Test series without taking a wicket. When he was given the opportunity to make use of the batting surface in India&#x27;s only innings in Faisalabad, he managed a brisk 38, including two sixes. Harbhajan was dropped for the Third Test in Karachi, where a green pitch promised to favour seam bowling, and Kumble was the only spinner used. After sustaining an injury, Harbhajan was sent home during the subsequent ODI series without playing a match, ending his tour without taking a wicket.
A return to Indian soil for the Test series against England failed to ease Harbhajan&#x27;s wicket-taking difficulties. He managed match figures of 2/172 in the drawn First Test in Nagpur, and 1/83 in the Second Test in Mohali, where his main contribution was to hit 36 runs, helping India to a first innings lead. Despite taking 3/89 and 2/40 in the Third Test in Mumbai, Harbhajan ended the series with eight wickets at an average of 48.00, nearly twice his career average on Indian soil. Despite his difficulties in Test cricket, Harbhajan&#x27;s ODI form remained strong, as he top-scored with a rearguard 37 out of 203 and then took 5/31 in a man of the match performance in the first ODI against England in Delhi, sparking a collapse of 7/47 which secured a 39-run victory. He ended the series with 12 wickets at 15.58 at an economy rate of 3.74 from five matches, and topped the wicket-taking list despite being rested for the last match, as well as having the best bowling average and economy rate. India took the series 5–1, Harbhajan taking 3/30 in their only loss.

Harbhajan was unable to maintain his ODI form on the tour to the West Indies, where he managed three wickets at 64 in five matches, although he continued to be economical, conceding 3.91 runs per over. He was omitted from the Test team for the opening two Tests as India opted to use three pace bowlers and Anil Kumble, scrapping the five bowler strategy used since early 2006. The reasons for the return to the four-man attack were unclear, with performance, fatigue and injury variously offered as explanations. Harbhajan was recalled for the Third Test in St Kitts after the pace attack was unable to dismiss the West Indian batsmen, with local captain Brian Lara stating that his team, who had three wickets in hand at the end of play, would have been lucky to draw the Second Test had Harbhajan been playing. In a drawn match, Harbhajan claimed the leading match figures of 6/186, as well as contributing an unbeaten 38 in the first innings. Harbhajan&#x27;s 5/13 in 27 balls in the first innings in the Fourth Test saw the hosts lose their last six wickets for 23, to give India a 97 run first innings lead. India went on secure a victory in a low scoring match in three days and win the series 1–0, although Harbhajan was punished in the second innings, conceding 65 runs in 16 overs without taking a wicket. It was India&#x27;s first series victory in the Caribbean in 35 years, with Harbhajan contributing 11 wickets at 24.00.

The 2006–07 season began with the DLF Cup in Malaysia, where Harbhajan made a good start to the season, taking six wickets at 19.16 at an economy rate of 3.59 in four matches. He was man of the match against the West Indies, scoring 37 in a 78-run partnership to push India to 162, before taking 3/35 to secure a 16-run victory. India failed to reach the final, contested by Australia and the West Indies. Harbhajan was unable to maintain his form in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India, managing only two wickets at 51.50 and saving his worst performance of 0/49 in the final group match against Australia on his home ground in Punjab. India won only one of their three matches and were eliminated, although Harbhajan continued to be tidy, conceding 3.67 runs per over. The tour of South Africa in late 2006 saw even less success, taking only one wicket in three ODI matches while conceding 161 runs at the expensive economy rate of 5.75. He finished the year watching from the sidelines as India fielded Kumble as the only spinner in the three Test series, which India lost 2–1. Apart from the injury hit 2003, it was Harbhajan&#x27;s least productive year in Test cricket since he became a regular team member in 2001, managing only 19 wickets at 52.78.

Harbhajan returned for the early 2007 ODI series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in India, taking seven wickets at 36.00 in seven matches at an economy rate of 4.27. Despite criticism that he was afraid to toss the ball up, and was concentrating on bowling flat in a defensive run-saving style, Harbhajan was selected as the off spin bowler in the Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, while Ramesh Powar, who had been more expensive but had taken more wickets in recent times, was omitted. A statistical study showed that since the start of 2006, Harbhajan has been the second most economical bowler in the final 10 overs of ODIs.

During the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Harbhajan started as India&#x27;s first-choice spinner and played in their first match against Bangladesh. He took 0/30 from his ten overs, but India lost the match as their batsmen collapsed and Bangladesh had no need to take risks against the bowling. Harbhajan was dropped in favour of Kumble for the second match against Bermuda, which India won easily. Harbhajan was recalled for the final group match against Sri Lanka, and had little effect, taking 0/53 from his ten overs as India were set 255 for victory. Harbhajan made an unbeaten 17 as India collapsed to 185 to lose the match and be eliminated in the group phase. Following the failed campaign, the Indian selectors made multiple changes to the national team and Harbhajan was dropped for the tours of Bangladesh and England. Rajesh Pawar, Piyush Chawla and Powar were the spinners selected to partner Kumble. Harbhajan&#x27;s waning wicket-taking and his lack of flight were again perceived to be the cause of his problems.

In the meantime, Harbhajan played in two ODIs for the Asian Cricket Council against a combined African team, taking 1/53 and 3/48 as the Asians won both matches. He then returned to Surrey for a second season of county cricket in an attempt to rediscover his form while his compatriots were touring England, staying throughout July and August. After easing into the season with six wickets in the first two first-class matches, Harbhajan found a rich vein of form, taking 4/64 and 5/64 against Worcestershire, before following up with 5/34 and 6/57 against Kent, finishing off by scoring 29 to help guide Surrey home by four wickets after they had stumbled in pursuit of 107. He ended the first-class campaign with five and six wickets against Durham and Hampshire respectively and totalled 37 wickets at 18.54 in only six outings. He was not so successful in the one-dayers, taking six wickets at 29.50 and an economy rate of 4.65 in five matches.

===2007 recall to the team===
Harbhajan returned to international cricket as part of India&#x27;s squad for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa in September 2007, which India won, having been rank outsiders at the start of the tournament with many senior players opting out of the competition. He played in all six of India&#x27;s matches and totalled seven wickets at 26.00 and an economy rate of 7.91. In the opening pool match against Pakistan, Harbhajan hit the stumps in a bowl-out after scores were tied; India won 3–0 after three rounds. In the semi-final against Australia, Harbhajan bowled Michael Clarke and conceded only three runs in his final over, the 18th of the match, to turn the match towards India. The final against Pakistan was the only match in which Harbhajan did not bowl his full quota of four overs, after being struck for three sixes in his third over by Misbah-ul-Haq, who led a late charge towards the target. India prevailed by five runs in the final over, Misbah being the last man to fall.

Harbhajan was recalled to the ODI squad during India&#x27;s home season in 2006–07, which comprised series against Australia and Pakistan. In ten ODIs, he took seven wickets at 61.71 125 and an economy rate of 4.59, much higher than his career average. He scored 101 runs at 33.66 in these matches, including an unbeaten 38 in one match against Pakistan. He was then recalled to the Test squad, and with India fielding two spinners in its home series against Pakistan, Harbhajan accompanied Kumble in all three Tests. Playing in Tests for the first time in 16 months, he took 10 wickets at 44.10, much higher than his career average in India. His best result was 5/122 in the first innings of the Second Test at Eden Gardens. 

He toured Australia and played in three of the four Tests—India persisted with two spinners in all venues except for the Third Test at the pace-friendly WACA Ground. He was centre of the controversy in the Second Test, 2007–08 Border–Gavaskar Trophy, accused of calling Andrew Symonds, a monkey. As he was during his previous visits to Australia, Harbhajan was ineffective with the ball. In the First Test in Melbourne, he took match figures of 3/162, before taking 4/200 in the Second Test in Sydney. Upon his recall in Adelaide, he took 1/128 in Australia&#x27;s only innings on a placid surface, ending the series with eight wickets at 61.25. However, he did manage to take Ponting&#x27;s wicket for three consecutive innings in the first two Tests, leading to much speculation about the Australian captain&#x27;s difficulties against the off spinner. After the third dismissal in the Sydney Test, Harbhajan celebrated by running a distance before twice rolling over on the ground. Harbhajan&#x27;s most noted contribution with the bat came in the Second Test when he came to the crease with India at 345/7, still 118 runs behind Australia, after a middle-order collapse of 4/52. He made 63 runs in a 129-run partnership with Tendulkar, which enabled India to gain a first-innings lead. In the Fourth Test, he came to the crease at 7/359 and scored 63 in a 107-run rearguard partnership with captain Kumble, allowing India to reach 529. He failed to reach double figures in his four other innings and ended with 142 runs at 23.66.

===Revival===
Harbhajan returned to international cricket for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August. In the First Test at Colombo, he took 2/149 as Sri Lanka amassed 600/6 declared and won by an innings. In the Second Test in Galle, he took 6/102 to help India take a first innings lead of 37 and then took 4/51 in the second innings to help India level the series with a 170-run win. It was his fifth ten-wicket match haul and his first outside India. He was again India&#x27;s leading wicket-taker in the Third Test defeat, with 3/104 and 1/44. He was India&#x27;s leading wicket-taker with 16 scalps at 28.12, twice as many the second most-prolific Indian. In the subsequent ODI series, he played in the first four matches, taking six wickets at 18.83 at an economy rate of 3.80, including 3/40 in the win in the fourth match, which sealed the series. He was rested from the final dead rubber.

At the start of the Indian season, Harbhajan took 2/32 and 4/31 as the Rest of India defeated Delhi in the Irani Trophy. This was followed by the First Test against Australia in Bangalore. Harbhajan took Ponting&#x27;s wicket in taking 1/103 in the first innings, but not before the Australian captain had scored 123. In reply to Australia&#x27;s 430, India were in trouble at 195/6 when Harbhajan came in to bat. He scored a rearguard 54, putting on 80 with fellow bowler Zaheer Khan, to reduce India&#x27;s deficit to 70. He then took 2/76 in the second innings as the match ended in a draw. Ponting later cited Harbhajan and Zaheer&#x27;s partnership as the passage of play that prevented an Australian win. In the Second Test at his home ground in Mohali, Harbhajan took 2/60 in the first innings as India took a 201-run first innings lead. In the second innings Australia were chasing 516 for victory and had started aggressively, reaching 49/0 after seven overs. Harbhajan was introduced into the attack and removed Hayden and Simon Katich in his first over and then Mike Hussey in his next. This triggered Australia&#x27;s collapse to 58/5 and their eventual defeat by 320 runs. Harbhajan was unable to find a fourth wicket, which would have seen him reach 300 Test wickets on his home ground, and ended with 3/36. He was then ruled out of the drawn Third Test because of a toe injury. Harbhajan returned for the Fourth Test in Nagpur and dismissed Ponting for the tenth time in Tests in the first innings to register his 300th wicket. He ended with 3/94 as India took an 86-run lead. However, a batting collapse meant that India were 6/166 at tea on day four, only 252 runs ahead and facing possible defeat if Australia could clean up the tail quickly. Harbhajan then scored 52, combining in a 107-run partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to guide India out of trouble. India then successfully defended the target of 380 to win by 172 runs, with Harbhajan taking 4/64 including top-scorer Hayden and the final wicket.

Harbhajan was the equal-leading wicket-taker for the series along with Ishant Sharma, taking 15 wickets at 28.86. He also scored 125 runs at 41.66, helping to prevent two defeats. The series also saw the end of Harbhajan&#x27;s partnership with Kumble, who missed the Second Test due to injury and then retired after suffering another wound in the next match. As a result, Harbhajan started a new pairing with leg spinner Amit Mishra.

In the five-match home ODI series against England, Harbhajan took seven wickets at 30.29 and an economy rate of 5.04 as India won 5–0. He took one wicket in each of the matches, except the third match in Kanpur. In that match, he took 3/31, registered his 200th ODI wicket and was named man-of-the match. During the two Tests, Harbhajan was the equal-leading wicket-taker with eight wickets at 35.00 and he also scored 69 runs at 34.50. This included a 40 in the first innings of the First Test to help India reach 241 after a top-order collapse, keeping India&#x27;s deficit to 75; they went on to win the match. Harbhajan ended the year as the third-highest wicket-taker in the world, and the highest among Indian players. He was named by &quot;Wisden&quot; in their selection of the Test team of the year.

Harbhajan then missed the ODI tour of Sri Lanka at the beginning of the year with a hamstring injury. He recovered in time to be recalled for the tour of New Zealand. Harbhajan was the leading wicket-taker from both sides in both ODIs and Tests. Harbhajan was India&#x27;s most economical bowler in the two T20 internationals at the start of the tour, taking a total of 2/34 from eight overs and scoring 21 in the first match; the hosts prevailed in both games. In series that saw four of the five ODIs truncated by rain, Harbhajan took five wickets at 29.60 at an economy rate of 5.69. He took 3/27 in the opening match, and then took 2/56 from ten overs in the third game, in which both teams passed 330, helping India to wins in both matches. In the First Test, Harbhajan took 1/57 and 6/63 to help set up a ten-wicket win. It was only the second time that he had taken five wickets in an innings outside the subcontinent. However, he was disappointing in a high-scoring draw in the Second Test, taking 2/120 as the hosts amassed 9/619 declared. In the Third Test, India suffered a middle-order collapse on the first afternoon, and a counter-attacking 60 by Harbhajan helped them to 379. He then took 3/43 and 4/59; New Zealand had only two wickets in hand when rain caused the match to end in a draw with more than a day&#x27;s playing time lost. Harbhajan ended with 16 wickets at 21.37 and 94 runs at 23.50. India won both series, their first series win in New Zealand since 1981 and 1968 for ODIs and Tests respectively.

===2009 ICC tournaments===
Harbhajan was part of the Indian team that attempted to defend their crown at the 2009 World Twenty20. However they lost all three of their matches in the Super 8s round and were eliminated. Harbhajan took 3/30 in one of those matches against England, and ended the tournament with five wickets at 26.20 and an economy rate of 6.55. During the tour of the West Indies that followed, Harbhajan took three wickets at 45.33, conceding almost a run a ball in three ODIs as India prevailed 2–1.

In September, Harbhajan took 5/56 in the final of the Compaq Cup to help secure a 46-run Indian win over the hosts Sri Lanka. It was his first five-wicket haul in three years and capped off a tournament in which he took six wickets at 22.00 in three matches. He then struggled at the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, taking 1/71 from ten overs against Pakistan and 0/54 from nine overs against Australia. India lost to Pakistan and the latter match was washed out. He then took 2/14 from eight overs against the West Indies, but it was not enough to prevent India from being eliminated in the first round, despite winning the match.

===2010 season===
After his travails in South Africa, Harbhajan started the Indian season with eight wickets at 12.87 in three Challenger Trophy one-dayers for India Blue. He then played in a home ODI series against Australia taking eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.51 in six games. This included a best of 2/23 in the sixth match, but he made a more influential contribution in the first match with the bat, striking 49 at the death as India came within striking distance of their target before he fell in the last over and the hosts ended five runs adrift of the target. He scored a similarly rapid 31 in the fourth match, but India fell 24 runs short. Harbhajan ended the series with 81 runs at 20.25.

In the three home Tests against Sri Lanka, Harbhajan was the highest wicket-taker with 13 scalps, but these came at an average cost of 41.00. After taking 2/189 in the drawn First Test, he aggregated 5/152 and 6/192 as India took the next two fixtures by an innings. In the subsequent ODI series, he took six wickets at 35.00 at an economy rate of 4.88 as India won 3–1. He took 2/58 from his ten overs in the first match, which proved to be tidy in the context of a match in which both teams passed 410 and India prevailed by three runs.

During the tri-series in Bangladesh in January 2010, Harbhajan took six wickets at 24.00 in three matches. He missed the First Test due to neck pain but returned to take a total of 2/123 as India completed a clean sweep with a ten-wicket win in the Second Test.

During New Zealand&#x27;s tour of India in November 2010, Harbhajan scored his maiden Test century during the First Test in Ahmedabad. This was the 100th century by an Indian in the second innings and he reached triple figures with a six. His 115, along with Laxman&#x27;s 91 saved the game for India after they had collapsed to 5/15. Harbhajan was named man of the match. He followed on in the next test with 111* in India&#x27;s 1st innings, becoming the first no. 8 batsman to score back-to-back test centuries.

After an ordinary performance with the ball in the 5-match ODI series in West Indies in June 2011 (where he was the vice captain to skipper Suresh Raina) (took 4 wickets from 3 matches, best of 3/32), he helped his team revive from dire straits in the 1st Test in Sabina Park at Kingston, Jamaica. With India struggling at 85/6, he along with Suresh Raina initiated a counter-attack to string an aggressive 146-run partnership with Suresh Raina(82 off 115 balls, 15 fours) to help India reach 246. Harbhajan scored 70 from 74 balls (10 fours, 1 six).

===2011 removal from squad===
Following a few poor performances, Harbhajan was injured in India&#x27;s tour of England in the summer/monsoon of 2011 and was ruled out of the rest of the series. Harbhajan was also not selected for the Australian tour and the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He was, however, included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament held in Sri Lanka in September 2012. He was recalled to the Test squad after a gap of more than a year against New Zealand at the end of August 2012. Harbhajan was dropped from the test team after the 2013 series against Australia. He was called back to the test team after two years for a solitary test against Bangladesh.

===2015–2016 inclusion===
Following performances in IPL for Mumbai Indians in 2014 and 2015, he was included in the test team captained by Virat Kohli against Bangladesh for the one-off test match in Fatullah. He took 3 wickets in that test to overtake Wasim Akram in the list of most test match wickets to become the ninth highest wicket-taker in Tests. He was then called up for the ODI and T20I teams when a second-string Indian side toured Zimbabwe to play three One-day and two Twenty-20 matches. Though he did not take many wickets in that tour, he was impressive maintaining a tight line and stopping the flow of runs.

Harbhajan returned with figures of 2/29 in his first T20 international over two and a half years. He was in the squad for the 3 test away series against Sri Lanka led by Virat Kohli. He replaced injured Ashwin in series against South Africa. He was also part of the team that played 3 T20I matches against Australia, home series against Sri Lanka, Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He played only one match in the Asia Cup against UAE. He was also part of the T20 World Cup that took place in India but did not play any of the matches.

===2017 Champions Trophy exclusion===
Harbhajan was again excluded from the Indian squad for the 2017 Champions Trophy in England. After hearing of his exclusion, Harbhajan claimed he did not receive the same &quot;privileges&quot; other veteran cricketers, namely MS Dhoni, have been afforded by the national selectors. After the media pounced on this comment, Harbhajan claimed the media frenzy took his statement out of proportion.

==Playing style==
Harbhajan was an attacking bowler who was regarded for his ball control and ability to vary his length and pace, although he was often criticised for his flat trajectory. His main wicket-taking ball climbs wickedly on the unsuspecting batsman from a good length, forcing him to alter his stroke at the last second. With a whippy bowling action, he was reported for throwing in November 1998. Although forced to travel to England for tests, his action was cleared by former English player Fred Titmus.

He has developed an ability to bowl the doosra, which was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad, on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson, and TV umpire Mahbubur Rahman after the Second Test between India and Bangladesh at Chittagong, Bangladesh in December 2004. The ICC cleared his action in May 2005, saying that the straightening of his elbow fell within the permitted limits.

Among off spinners, Harbhajan is the third highest wicket-taker in Test history, behind only Muttiah Muralitharan and Ravichandran Ashwin. He is the third-highest Test wicket-taker among all Indians. Harbhajan average with the ball in home Test matches hovers in the mid-20s. All five of his man of the match awards and both of his man of the series awards have been obtained in India. Outside India, his bowling average climbs to around 40. Statistically, his bowling in Test matches is most effective against the West Indies and Australia. As of May 2008, his most productive hunting grounds have been Eden Gardens in Calcutta, where he has taken 38 wickets at 23.10 in six Tests, while the Chepauk in Chennai, where he has claimed two-man of the match awards, has yield 34 wickets at 24.25 in five Tests. Harbhajan has claimed his wickets most cheaply at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, where he has taken 22 wickets at 19.45. Compared to Muralitharan, Harbhajan is less reliant on targeting the stumps for his dismissals; he captures more than 60% of his wickets via catches and less than 25% by bowling or trapping batsmen leg before wicket, whereas the corresponding figures for Muralitharan are in the 40s. Harbhajan&#x27;s off spin complements Kumble&#x27;s leg spin. While Harbhajan is known for his emotional and extroverted celebrations, which are part of a deliberate strategy of aggression, Kumble is known for his undemonstrative and composed approach. Both spinners have opined that they bowl more effectively in tandem via persistent application of pressure to batsmen, but statistics have shown that while Kumble has performed better when paired with Harbhajan, Harbhajan has been more effective in Kumble&#x27;s absence.

Harbhajan has been particularly successful against Australian batsman Ricky Ponting, taking his wicket on ten occasions in Test cricket.

In an interview in 2001, Harbhajan stated his ambition to become an all-rounder. Although he had recorded a few half-centuries at Test level, his batting average hovered around 15 in both Tests and ODIs. However, in the span of four years starting from 2003, he has shown improved performance, averaging around 20 with the bat. His style is frequently described as unorthodox, with pundits agreeing with his self-assessment attributing his batting achievements to his hand-eye coordination, rather than his footwork or technique. The aggression in Harbhajan&#x27;s bowling also extends to his batting, with a Test strike rate in the 60s, placing him in the ten highest strike rates among players who have scored more than 1000 runs in Test cricket.

==Controversies==
===1998 suspension===
Harbhajan was fined and given a suspended ban for one ODI by the match referee in his first international series, when his on-field behaviour was adjudged to breach the ICC Code of Conduct. The incident in question was his altercation with Ricky Ponting after dismissing him.

===Altercations with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth===
While Harbhajan was batting during his 63 on the third day of the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he became involved in an altercation with Australia&#x27;s Andrew Symonds. As a result of this, he was charged with a Level 3 offence of racially abusing Symonds by calling the Australian—of Afro-Caribbean descent—a &quot;monkey&quot;. Harbhajan and Tendulkar, his batting partner at the time of the incident, denied this. At a hearing after the conclusion of the Test, match referee Mike Procter found Harbhajan guilty and banned him for three Tests. This decision generated controversy because no audio or video evidence was available, and the conviction relied on the testimony of the Australian players. The Indian team initially threatened to withdraw from the series pending an appeal against Harbhajan&#x27;s suspension, however BCCI president Sharad Pawar later claimed that the tour would proceed even if the second hearing was unsuccessful.

On 29 January, following the Fourth Test, the appeal hearing was conducted in Adelaide by ICC Appeals Commissioner Justice John Hansen. The result was that the racism charge was not proved, resulting in the revocation of the three-Test ban imposed by Procter. However, Harbhajan was found guilty of using abusive language and fined 50% of his match fee. Hansen later admitted he &quot;could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler&#x27;s previous transgressions&quot;—including a suspended one-Test ban. It was reported that senior players from both sides had written a letter to Hansen requesting that the charge be downgraded. According to this report, the letter was signed by Tendulkar and Ponting and counter-signed by Michael Clarke, Hayden, and Symonds himself.

In the aftermath of the hearing, Hayden called Harbhajan an &quot;obnoxious weed&quot; during a radio interview, which earned him a code of conduct violation charge from Cricket Australia.
Harbhajan was involved in further controversy after a 2008 Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab at Mohali in April 2008. While the teams were shaking hands, he slapped Kerala paceman and Indian teammate Sreesanth in the face. Harbhajan, who had stood in as the Mumbai captain for the first three matches of the tournament to that point, all of which were lost, had apparently been angered by Sreesanth&#x27;s aggressive sending-off of his batsmen as Punjab coasted to a decisive victory. The Kings XI Punjab lodged an official complaint to the IPL. The match referee Farokh Engineer found Harbhajan guilty of a level 4.2 offence, banning him from the remainder of the IPL and preventing him from claiming his entire season&#x27;s salary. Harbhajan made up with Sreesanth, and said that &quot;I have been punished for the wrong I did&quot;. Harbhajan had taken five wickets at 16.40 at an economy rate of 8.20 and scored 30 runs at 15.00 in the three matches before his ban. On 14 May, the BCCI disciplinary committee found Harbhajan guilty under Rule 3.2.1 of their regulations and handed down the maximum punishment of five-match ban from ODIs. Harbhajan faces the prospect of a life ban if he commits significant disciplinary breaches in the future. As a result, Harbhajan missed the tri-series in Bangladesh and the 2008 Asia Cup in Pakistan, and India went down in the final of both tournaments after qualifying first on both occasions. He would have been eligible for selection after the first two matches of the Asia Cup, but the selectors omitted him entirely.

In 2021, he tendered an unconditional apology for sharing a social media post with a picture of Khalistani militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to pay homage to those who died in &#x27;Operation Blue Star&#x27; of 1984. Facing backlash from all quarters, Harbhajan said he posted a WhatsApp forward on the 37th anniversary of the operation without realizing that the man in the picture was Bhindranwale.

===Twitter fight with Mohammad Amir===
On 27 October 2021, Harbhajan was involved in an ugly spat with Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Amir on Twitter following India&#x27;s loss to Pakistan in 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

==Political career==
In March 2022, Singh was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the Aam Aadmi Party as one of their five candidates from the state of Punjab. He won unopposed and was officially elected as Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha.

On 18 July 2022, Harbhajan took oath as a member of the Rajya Sabha from Punjab on the first day of the Monsoon session of Parliament.

<doc id="409525" wikidata="Q2455196" url="?curid=409525" title="Acura TSX">
<text>The Acura TSX is a compact executive car manufactured by Honda and sold through its Acura division from 2003 to 2014. The TSX spanned two generations, both derived from the corresponding Japanese/European versions of the Honda Accord, which were more compact and sporting-oriented than their larger North American counterpart. The latter Accord platform was also used for the Acura TL, which slotted above the TSX in Acura&#x27;s lineup. All TSXs were built in Sayama, Saitama, Japan.

The first-generation TSX was introduced as a 2004 model in April 2003 as a rebadged version of the Japanese domestic market (JDM) Honda Accord 2.4 Type-S, with the exception of its interior, borrowed from the JDM fourth-generation Honda Inspire. It was succeeded by the second-generation TSX, introduced in March 2008 as a 2009 model and based on the eighth-generation JDM Accord. Notably, the final generation of the TSX would introduce a V6 option for 2010, and a wagon for 2011.

It was sold in North America under the Acura luxury marque as the replacement for the Integra sedan which was discontinued in 2001 (1996 in Canada since the EL was the Integra sedan&#x27;s replacement there), and would become Acura&#x27;s entry-level vehicle after the Acura RSX got discontinued in 2006. From the 2007 model year until 2012, the TSX was the smallest vehicle in the Acura model line, other than the Civic-based CSX and the preceding Acura 1.6 and 1.7 EL sold only in Canada. In 2013, the smaller ILX was introduced in both the United States and Canada, based upon the Civic platform (replacing the CSX in Canada). 

Honda discontinued the TSX and the larger TL during 2014 with the introduction of the TLX, which replaced both vehicles, although the TLX is close in size to the TL. The recently-introduced ILX succeeded the TSX as Acura&#x27;s entry-level offering.

== First generation (CL9; 2003) ==


===Overview===
The Acura TSX was introduced at the 2003 North American International Auto Show as a production model. The 2004 model year TSX&#x27;s powertrain consisted of a 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder K24A2 engine which produced 200 horsepower, a six-speed manual transmission (which featured a magnesium casing, to reduce weight), and a front wheel drive layout. A five-speed automatic transmission was a no-cost option in the U.S. based on MSRP; however, such was not the case in Canada.

In 2006, the TSX was updated with slight tweaks to the engine (adding 5 hp with an increase from 200 hp to 205 hp); a sportier exterior styling featuring a slightly new front and rear treatment, standard side skirts, and standard, integral fog lights; and restyled wheels.

In 2007, Tire Pressure Monitoring System and an improved electronic rear view mirror were added, and the 2008 model year brought a new color option.

===Interior===
2005 was the second year of the TSX and Acura updated it with XM Satellite Radio, a four-way power passenger seat and illuminated the steering wheel-mounted audio and cruise controls. Along with the slight tweaks to the engine in 2006, interior tech features were also added, including a Multi-information Display (MID) in the instrument panel, and luxury features such as a two-position memory for the driver&#x27;s seat adjustments which adjusted according to which of two keys were being used, auxiliary MP3 player input and Bluetooth-compatible &quot;HandsFreeLink&quot; (for cellular phones). The Bluetooth &quot;HandsFreeLink&quot; system operates through voice control, where the user speaks when the HandsFreeLink button is pressed. Six different phones can be paired up to the HandsFreeLink system.

===Safety===
In testing conducted by the United States-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the Acura TSX received an overall rating of &quot;Good&quot; for frontal offset testing, an overall rating of &quot;Poor&quot; rear crash protection, and an overall rating of &quot;Acceptable&quot; for side impact testing.

===Engine===
The K24A2 engine used in the TSX was related to the engine in the Honda Accord (7th generation), the Honda CR-V, and the Honda Element. The K24A2 featured intelligent variable valve timing (i-VTEC) and produced in this iteration. Another feature of the i-VTEC system on the TSX and RSX-s was that, unlike other Honda K-series motors, variable timing was used on both the intake and exhaust cams in its three rocker design.

In 2005, for the 2006 model year, the K24A2 was updated to produce 205 hp (153 kW). The diameter of the throttle body and intake valves were slightly increased, along with the cam duration and valve lift.
== Second generation (CU2; 2008) ==


===Overview===
The redesigned 2009 Acura TSX made its debut at the New York International Auto Show on March 20, 2008 before going on sale on April 24. In terms of size, the TSX was larger than its predecessor with greater width, a wider track and a longer wheelbase, and the length grew by . Curb weight increased by approximately .

Making its debut on the new TSX was Honda&#x27;s Advanced Compatibility Engineering body structure, which was designed to reduce accident impact on occupants. In the United States, the TSX came standard with luxury features like leather seat upholstery, dual-zone climate control, power driver&#x27;s seat with memory, sunroof, Xenon headlights, and added a USB port music interface; in Canada this configuration was known as the &quot;Premium Package&quot; as there was a base trim available with the four-cylinder TSX that has cloth seats and halogen headlights, and without the USB connector, memory seat function, and fog lamps. The TSX had an optional technology package, which included a navigation system, real-time traffic and weather, and a 10-speaker premium sound system with DVD-audio capabilities.

For the United States, Acura also added a &quot;Sport Wagon&quot; body style of the TSX in late 2010 for the 2011 model year. The wagon was available with the I4 engine and 5-speed automatic.

In 2009, the 2010 model year TSX added an optional 3.5L 280 hp V6 engine, shared with the Acura TL, and which was not available for the CL-series Accord sold in Europe. It came standard with the five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and 18-inch alloy wheels, and was available in either Premium or Technology trims.

In 2010, for the 2011 model year, the TSX received a facelifted upper grille with horizontal slots, a thin chrome molding surround replaced the wide silver surround, a redesigned front bumper cover with body-colored sections between the upper grille and each headlight, wider body-colored &quot;verticals&quot; in the lower grille separating revised foglamp areas, and a chrome trim piece added to the trunk lid between updated taillights. Inside included more LED lighting, new LED/VGA navigation screen and system functions with Technology Package, center console HVAC vents for rear occupants, and new trim colors, woodgrain, and metal finishes.

In 2011, for the 2012 model year, Acura introduced an all new Special Edition model. The exterior featured a more aggressive front spoiler giving it a sporty look, reminiscent of their old sports coupe, the RSX. Other cosmetic upgrades included a rear bumper fascia, side sills, and a &quot;Special Edition&quot; badge on the trunklid. In the cabin, Acura made sport-minded appointments including suede seat inserts with red backing. There was red stitching on the shift knob, seats, and steering wheel, along with red ambient lighting featured on the gauge cluster, overhead lighting, and footwell lighting. The pedals were also upgraded to aluminum.

In late 2013 Honda announced that the TSX would be replaced with the Acura TLX sedan and that they would discontinue sales of the TSX model in 2014.

===Engine===
The second-generation TSX uses a base engine similar to that of the first-generation TSX. The engine is a 2.4-liter in-line 4-cylinder engine reaching 201 hp (150 kW) and torque. While the rated power of the new TSX engine is lower than that of the 2008 model, Acura says the new engine distributes power across a much wider rpm range, which along with the increased torque, provides an increased feeling of power for the driver. The transmission choices remain 5-speed automatic and 6-speed manual, though the automatic version now comes with steering-wheel paddle shifters for optional manual shifting.

In 2009, for the 2010 model year, the Acura TSX has an optional 280 hp 3.5-liter V6, shared with the larger Acura TL, and which was not available for the CL-series Accord sold in Europe. The V6 engine is only available with the 5-speed automatic transmission.

The Acura TSX was slated to receive a high-performance 2.2-liter i-DTEC clean turbodiesel engine in the 2010 model year, after having already offered it for the CL-series Accord sold in Europe. However, it was later announced that Honda had abandoned its plans to bring diesel engines to the U.S. and Japan in favor of hybrid gasoline-electric powertrains.

===TSX Sport Wagon===
The Acura TSX Sport Wagon is a badge-engineered version of CL-series Honda Accord Tourer station wagon. The Sport Wagon was unveiled in the 2010 New York Auto Show. The TSX Sportwagon is mechanically identical to the TSX Sedan, sharing the 201-horsepower Honda K engine 2.4L DOHC inline four-cylinder engine, Sequential SportShift 5-speed automatic transmission, and four-wheel independent sports suspension, however unlike the sedan the Sport Wagon is not offered with the 6-speed manual transmission nor the V6 engine.
 The Sport Wagon offers 60.5 cu-ft of rear cargo area (with rear seats folded down; 25.8 cu-ft with the seats up), rear seats with 60/40 fold-down design.

For the United States market, the 2011 Acura TSX Sport Wagon went on sale starting on December 21, 2010 with a base price of US$30,960 (US$34,610 with Technology Package). Acura Canada said that they would eventually sell the TSX Sport Wagon, citing market conditions as the reason for the delay, but ultimately never marketed it there. While the CL-series Honda Accord Tourer was quite successful in its market of Europe, station wagons were less popular in the United States. The competing Volkswagen Passat wagon and Mercedes C-Class wagons were withdrawn around the same time the TSX Sport Wagon was unveiled, leaving the BMW 3 Series Touring as the only wagon available in the entry-level luxury car category.

Changes for the 2012 TSX Sport Wagon include a compact tire repair kit that allows for a significantly larger underfloor storage area.
===2012 TSX Special Edition===
The 2012 TSX Special Edition is a version of the TSX commemorating the 25th anniversary of Acura, with a 6-speed manual or Sequential SportShift 5-speed automatic transmission, a more aggressive front spoiler, rear bumper fascia and side sills, 17x7.5-inch 5-spoke aluminum wheels with a dark grey finish, a &quot;Special Edition&quot; badge on the trunklid, perforated black Lux Suede inserts and red backing upholstery, unique red stitching and red-lighting throughout the interior, aluminum pedal covers and a black headliner material replaces the standard grey headliner used on other TSX models.

The Technology package includes ELS audio system and hard-drive based navigation system.

The TSX Special Edition was unveiled in 2011 Orange County International Auto Show.

In Canada, a very similar model to the US model SE, was also released. It shared the same features as the American model, but was officially called an A Spec trim. It had an A Spec badge on each fender, and came with unique 18” multi spoke alloy wheels were both silver and dark grey

===Safety===
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found the 2009-11 TSX to have an overall driver death of 7 deaths per million registered years, the 2nd lowest of midsize four-door cars, and both single-vehicle crash death rate and rollover death rate of 0.

<doc id="409526" wikidata="Q1617812" url="?curid=409526" title="High Park">
<text>High Park is a municipal park in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. High Park is a mixed recreational and natural park, with sporting facilities, cultural facilities, educational facilities, gardens, playgrounds and a zoo. One-third of the park remains in a natural state, with a rare oak savannah ecology. High Park was opened to the public in 1876 and is based on a bequest of land from John George Howard to the City of Toronto. It spans and is one of the largest parks in Toronto.

High Park is located to the west of downtown Toronto, north of Humber Bay, and is maintained by the City of Toronto Parks Department. It stretches south from Bloor Street West to The Queensway, just north of Lake Ontario. It is bounded on the west by Ellis Park Road and Grenadier Pond and on the east by Parkside Drive.
==Description==
The landscape in the park is hilly, with two deep ravines extending the full north–south distance of the park. Significant natural parts of the park are classified as a provincial Area of Natural and Scientific Interest.

===Eastern ravine===

The eastern ravine is a north–south ravine occupying the eastern half of the park along a small creek and several ponds. A forested area begins at the north-east corner of the park, at Bloor Street and Parkside Drive. The creek begins at spring-fed ponds, Howard Pond, and Ridout Pond and flows south through the ravine along Spring Creek Road. Halfway to the southern boundary of the park, the ravine is less forested with picnic areas, the adventure playground, and the zoo. Upper Duck Pond, just to the west of the adventure playground, often has several species of ducks, including wood ducks to be seen. The pond was one of the first locations where bird banding was done, marked by a plaque. Great blue herons can sometimes be seen there and at Lower Duck Pond, just north of The Queensway, where the water drains in pipes south to Lake Ontario.

The eastern ravine lies over a buried river. In 2003, city workers found strong evidence of the pre-ice-age Laurentian River when capping two artesian wells at the pond at the north-east corner of the Park. The wells began spewing a plume of water, sand, shale and gravel 15 metres into the air. With this discovery, geologists finally pinpointed the southern terminus of this ancient river system whose southerly flow begins near Georgian Bay. The watercourse, flowing below the surface in pure bedrock, has remained undisturbed for thousands of years.

===Central plain and savannah===

The central section is a large plain encompassing most of the northern boundary, slowly narrowing to a point overlooking the lake, which is the location of Colborne Lodge. While most of the plain is developed for picnicking, gardens and sports fields, it has a stretch of open habitat called oak savannah, of which there are few other examples in Ontario. The towering black oak trees found throughout High Park are a characteristic of this habitat. Many of the trees are over 150 years old. The savannah is under the special care of the City and volunteer conservationists. Forested areas of High Park are maintained to mimic natural conditions, with downed trees left to decay. Regular controlled burns are done to mimic forest fires and their beneficial effects for oaks. Non-native plants outside the ornamental gardens are weeded out by volunteers. There is, however, no shortage of non-native trees including Colorado spruce, Scots pine and Northern catalpa.

===Grenadier Pond===

Grenadier Pond is a large body of water in size, located on the western edge of the park. It is named after the local Town of York garrison of the 1800s and their use of the pond for fishing. There are two local myths circulating about the pond. One is that British Grenadiers fell through its thin ice when crossing to defend the city in the War of 1812. However the Grenadier Guards were not stationed at Fort York at this time, but rather the 8th (The King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot which are not linked to the Grenadier name. Most British infantry regiments grouped the largest and strongest men together during this period to form units of &#x27;Grenadiers&#x27;, who would form on the right flank of their parent regiment. Other myths include that the pond is &#x27;bottomless&#x27;, that is, its depth cannot be measured due to the amount of mud. Fishing remains a popular pastime. Largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, bluegill, brown bullhead and carp sport fish are present in the pond. Fish caught in the pond are safe to eat, and fishing derbies and casting contests have been held there.

Initiatives have been made to improve the pond&#x27;s health and environment. Grenadier Pond receives some of its water from Wendigo Creek (a small creek that began near Dundas Street West and Law Street and ran down to a sandbar to Lake Ontario) to Wendigo Pond and underground streams feeding it from the north. The northern end of the Pond was naturalized, building a wetland to filter the waters the Pond receives from the stream. The southern and south-western shore of the pond was also naturalized, removing the manicured lawn and concrete bank to improve the Pond&#x27;s health and discourage Canada geese. Signs now ask people not to feed the waterfowl. Grenadier Pond is home to multiple species of bird and marsh wildlife. The pond exits out to Lake Ontario via pipes near Sir Casimir Gzowski Park, replacing the natural sandbar that existed for Wendigo Creek. Alongside its eastern shore are to be found High Park&#x27;s hillside gardens and a grove of cherry trees.

At its northern end is a remnant of Wendigo Creek, Wendigo Pond and a children&#x27;s playground. The creek, pond and Wendigo Way are likely named after the wendigo, mythical cannibalistic creatures of Algonquian mythology. Algonquins did not have a settlement in the park, but are believed to have used it for hunting and fishing and cultivating corn on the sandy uplands of the park. The ravine extending north along the creek at one time extended north of the park, past Bloor Street. The ravine was filled in to provide for an extension of Bloor Street, and for housing development north of the park.
==History==
In 1836, John George Howard purchased a property in the County of York, to the west of Toronto, for a sheep farm, at the cost of $1,000. It was here that Howard designed and built Colborne Lodge, a Regency-style cottage in 1837 to complement its natural surroundings as the residence for himself and his wife Jemima Frances Meikle. The name &#x27;High Park&#x27; is attributed to Jemima, as Colborne Lodge is situated on the highest point of the Humber Bay shoreline.

In 1854, the railway first came to the south of the Howard estate. Howard sold a strip of land approximately along the southern edge of the property to Hamilton and Toronto Railway Company (Great Western Railway) for . The sand bar separating Grenadier Pond from Lake Ontario was filled in to support the rails. An outlet weir was installed to control water levels. In 1891, a further strip was sold to the Grand Trunk Railway for .

After a successful career as architect, engineer and land surveyor to the City of Toronto, Howard retired here in 1855. In 1873, Howard and his wife agreed to convey their country property of to the City of Toronto. There were several conditions to the conveyance, including that the Howards continue to live at their residence, no alcohol ever be served in the park, and that the city hold the park &quot;for the free use, benefit and enjoyment of the Citizens of Toronto for ever and to be called and designated at all times thereafter High Park&quot;. The City also had to pay a down payment and an annual pension to the Howards as long as either of them lived. The city council voted 13 to 2 to accept the Howard&#x27;s conditions. The two dissenters felt the park was too far away from the city to be of any use to its citizens. At the time, direct access to the Howard property was only by boat, the railway line to the south or a toll road. Soon afterward the &quot;Road to High Park&quot; was built from the Lake Road to the park lands, today&#x27;s Spring Road and Centre Road.
In 1876, a portion of the Howard&#x27;s property formed the original park, along with bought from Percival Ridout east of the Howard farm. The remaining southern of Howard&#x27;s property, including Colborne Lodge, passed to the city after John Howard&#x27;s death in 1890. The Howards are buried in High Park, under a stone monument that is fronted by a portion of ornate fencing from St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, England, across the street from Colborne Lodge. Today, Colborne Lodge is a museum containing many of the original Howard furnishings and a collection of Howard&#x27;s watercolours of early Toronto. The museum is open year-round.

The western section of High Park, including Grenadier Pond was privately owned by the Ellis family (headed by John Ellis), after which Ellis Avenue is named. The Ellis family sold the land to the Chapman family, which used Grenadier Pond for ice-making under the brand name of the Grenadier Ice Company from the 1880s. After the development of artificial ice-making and modern refrigerators, ice-making from Grenadier Pond ceased around 1920 (operations moved to a Lake Simcoe location under Alfred H. Chapman, Toronto architect who inherited the family business after his father&#x27;s death) The Grenadier Ice Company was located south of Grenadier Pond, east of Ellis Avenue. In 1930, the Chapmans sold , including the pond, to the City for .


The High Park Forest School was opened in 1915 on two acres at Colborne Lodge Road at Spring Road. The public school was for children of &quot;low vitality&quot; and emphasized physical activity over academics and often held classes outdoors. After the 1960s, the building was used by various organizations and was vacated in 2013. In 2015, High Park Nature Centre moved into the building.

In 1921, graves were found northwest of Grenadier Pond on the sandy ridge, during the course of road construction near Harcroft and Olympus Avenue, then the Harcroft Bird Sanctuary of architect J. A. Harvey. Eight skeletons were found in the sitting position in red sand below a huge stump. Other, smaller skeletons were found nearby. The human remains were dated to between 2,500 BC to 800 AD, indicating some sort of indigenous peoples&#x27; presence at High Park. The remains were coated in hematite red powdery substance in the custom of the Red Paint People who lived in New England and Atlantic Canada. The site is also similar to the Red Ocher people indigenous people who made burials in sandy ridges.

 of High Park was later given to Metro Transportation when The Queensway was built in the early 1950s. This was in contravention of stipulations by original High Park owner John Howard that the lands be used for parkland only. Metro officials searched for descendants of Howard to obtain their consent.

The park was known as a location for clandestine meetings of homosexuals in the days before the decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada in the 1960s. Its reputation as a meeting place persisted for decades afterward. In 1985, a group of five young teenage boys from Toronto suburbs went to High Park and beat to death a 40-year-old male librarian.

In 1993, the High Park Citizens&#x27; Advisory Committee was founded as a volunteer group to aid the City of Toronto in the stewardship of the park. The group was renamed the High Park Community Advisory Council in 2003. The group and its offshoots have developed various programs and initiatives for the park, including the Volunteer Stewardship Program, which is involved in preserving and protecting the environment of the park. The group is active in promoting the natural plant species in the park, and volunteers regularly remove invasive non-native species.

According to the Taiaiako&#x27;n Historical Preservation Society, there are 57 ancient indigenous peoples&#x27; burial mounds in the park. In May 2011, one such location was occupied by the Society. The site, a small hill known as &quot;Snake Mound&quot; on the west bank of Lower Duck Pond, had been eroded by illegal BMX bike use. The society, in cooperation with the City of Toronto, cordoned off the location and worked to restore the site, fixing the erosion, and removing the bike ramps present. At first, a replacement BMX bike park was suggested for the parking lot at the south end of Spring Road, but public opposition led the bike facility to be built south of the railway, on land that was infilled in the 1920s as part of the Sunnyside park development. A mound north of Grenadier Restaurant, known as &quot;Bear Mound&quot;, is believed by the Society to also be an ancient burial mound, although an assessment done for the City concluded otherwise.

In 2012, Toronto City Council, in a round of cuts to city services, voted to discontinue supporting the High Park Zoo and seek alternative funding. The zoo cost over annually to operate and was operated by the city&#x27;s Park and Recreations Department. An organization, &quot;Friends of the High Park Zoo&quot;, was formed to fund-raise and seek other sponsors for the zoo. In April 2012, the organization was successful in finding a sponsor (the Honey Family Foundation) while the organization developed a permanent source of funding. The sponsor matched public donations for the next three years. The City restored operational funding in 2014. The Friends fund-raises for improvements to the zoo.

==Points of interest==

The park includes several points of interest, including Colborne Lodge historical museum, the hillside gardens, the zoo, the Grenadier Cafe and the amphitheatre. The park also has sports fields, a hockey rink, a pool, tennis courts, playgrounds, nature trails and picnic areas.

From spring to fall, a &quot;trackless train&quot;—a tractor that tows several wagons decorated to look like a red and white train—is operated, making a tour of the park every 30 minutes. The train stops near Bloor Street, the north-western playground, west of the Grenadier Cafe, at Grenadier Pond, south of Colborne Lodge and at the Bell playground. Tickets for the train are purchased from the train&#x27;s conductor.

===Colborne Lodge===

Colborne Lodge is a historical museum located in an 1836 home built by John George Howard, an architect, engineer, and prominent Toronto citizen who was the first land-owner of High Park. Howard built this house, to house himself and his wife Jemima Frances Meikle. The lodge became the property of the city following his death in 1890. It is perched on the top of a hill overlooking Lake Ontario.
Across the street from the lodge is Howard&#x27;s tomb, a cairn monument of Howard and his wife. The fence gate for the cairn is originally from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, England. It dates from 1714, designed by Christopher Wren. Howard had it shipped from London in 1875.

===Gardens===

On the hill to the east of Grenadier Pond, extending up to Colborne Lodge Road, is a landscaped ornamental garden area known as &quot;Hillside Gardens&quot;. There is a rock garden extending from the top of the hill near Grenadier Cafe, extending south-west nearly to the pond shore. Along Colborne Lodge Road is a hanging garden and ornamental garden with fountains, the &#x27;sunken gardens.&#x27; At the bottom of the hill, nearly at the shoreline is a large maple leaf-shaped flower bed, visible from the top of the hill. The area was a tobogganing area in the early 1900s. Toboggan-runs were constructed from the top of the hill extending down to the pond&#x27;s ice surface. Wedding photography is no longer permitted in the hillside gardens area.

North of Colborne Lodge is the High Park Children&#x27;s Garden. It offers programs for schools in the fall and spring, and day camps during the summer for children to learn about growing plants and Toronto parks. The Children&#x27;s Garden and Colborne Lodge hold an annual &#x27;Harvest Festival&#x27; in the fall. It includes craft activities, pumpkin-decorating, gardening displays, traditional games, and rides on horse-drawn wagons.

North-east of the Grenadier Cafe are High Park&#x27;s 109 allotment gardens. To the east, south of Centre Road, are the High Park greenhouses. Since 1956, the High Park greenhouses have produced millions of annuals and perennials for Toronto&#x27;s park system. The nine interconnected greenhouses provide a view into the way the plants are grown and distributed across the city. The greenhouses are not normally open to the public, but are occasionally opened to tours.

Further north, around the High Park Forest School, are several examples of outdoor sculpture in the former sculpture garden. The sculptures were commissioned and placed around the area for a 1967 international symposium. Several of the sculptures are placed within the forested area. Since the symposium, several sculptures were relocated to other Toronto locations. One was relocated to Corktown Common and another to Iceboat Terrace, west of Spadina Avenue.

===Cherry trees===
There are several plantings of Japanese cherry trees in the park, attracting thousands of visitors every year from late April to early May. The main planting is a grove of trees along a roadway originating near Grenadier Cafe, leading down to Grenadier Pond. The other plantings are along West Road, the shore of the pond and west of the Jamie Bell playground. In 1959, the first Japanese Somei-Yoshino Cherry Tree was planted in High Park, a gift from the citizens of Tokyo. A plaque marks the spot in 1959 where the trees were presented by the Japanese ambassador to Toronto mayor Nathan Phillips. In all, over 2000 cherry trees were donated to Toronto.

Another 34 cherry trees were donated to High Park in 2001 from the Sakura project. These were planted around the Maple Leaf garden on the eastern shore of the pond. In 2006, a further 16 were planted in the park. In March 2019, Sakura in High Park indicated that following a brutal winter season, some trees showed signs of damage, however, many showed healthy, growing buds. The amount of visitors has necessitated the closure of the park to automobile traffic during the blooming period.

===Grenadier Cafe===

A 300-seat restaurant and outdoor patio area is located in the centre of the park at the intersection of West Road and Colborne Lodge Road. The restaurant opened in May 1958 as a dining room and coffee shop, known as &quot;The Grenadier&quot;. The outdoor patio area was added later. Due to the condition in the Howards&#x27; conveyance forbidding the consumption of alcohol in the park, High Park is the last &quot;dry&quot; area of the City of Toronto, and the Cafe restaurant and banquet hall is not licensed to serve alcohol. The restaurant is owned by the City of Toronto, and privately operated under contract by the Grenadier Group.

An outdoor organic produce market operates during the summer weekends. Twice a year, plant sales are held at the Cafe of plants native to the park to raise money for conservation activities. The plants are native to High Park and Ontario and cultivation of the plants is encouraged to preserve the species. The Cafe is also used for community meetings.

A labyrinth, based on the Chartres pattern, is located north of the cafe, marked onto a concrete circle formerly used for a picnic shelter. It was installed in 2004.

===High Park Nature Centre===

The High Park Nature Centre, located in the Forest School building, offers year-round outdoor and indoor programming to learn about nature. It has programs for parents and babies, school-aged children as well as family walks and adult workshops and lectures. A number of programmes with volunteers undertake stewardship activities in High Park to preserve native plant species, including the yearly removal of invasive species such as buckthorn. The Centre also organizes nature walks in the park. In 2016, over 12,000 visitors people took part in High Park Nature Centre programming.

The Centre is operated by High Park Initiatives, a registered non-profit organization. The High Park Nature Centre was awarded an Ontario Trillium Foundation grant in 2014, allowing for the purchase of furnishings to equip the much larger Forest School space and also to expand programming. Recently, an Outdoor Urban Restoration Space (OURSpace) was developed with the assistance of a Weston Parks Challenge Grant. The Centre was established in 1999.

===High Park Zoo===

High Park Zoo is a small collection of animals along Deer Pen Road, which rises from the eastern ravine up to the plateau near the Grenadier Restaurant. The zoo keeps American bison, Barbary sheep, capybaras, emus, Highland cattle, llamas, mouflon, peacocks, reindeer, wallabies and yaks in eleven paddocks. The zoo is open year-round from 7:00 a.m. to dusk. On weekends from March to October, the llama pen is open for visitors to feed and pet the llamas. Chickens and rabbits are also kept for children to interact with at the same time as the llama visits.

The zoo animals are cared for by Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division staff and Friends of High Park Zoo volunteers. The zoo&#x27;s budget is partly paid for by volunteer donations to donation boxes located along the zoo and online donations that are matched by charitable foundations. Friends of High Park Zoo was formed after Toronto City Council voted to cancel funding for the zoo in 2012. The organization has announced a master plan of improvements it hopes to make to the zoo.

The practice of keeping animals in the park originated in 1893, with the keeping of deer. The zoo received international media coverage in 2015 when a peacock escaped and was at large in the surrounding neighbourhood for several weeks before returning on its own to the zoo.

====Capybaras====
A pair of capybaras kept at the zoo escaped in May 2016. After initial efforts to capture them were unsuccessful, sightings of capybaras were reported all over the city. On June 6, the capybaras were still at large, and a Twitter account was created in their honour. On June 12, one was re-captured. On June 28, the second capybara was re-captured. Due to their exploits, the two were nicknamed Bonnie and Clyde. The month-long search cost the city $15,000 in services and overtime work paid to approximately 30 park staff under Toronto&#x27;s Parks, Forestry and Recreation department. In 2017, the pair became parents to three baby pups. The three pups were named Geddy, Alex and Neil, after the members of the Toronto rock group Rush.

===Shakespeare in High Park===
During the summer months, the Canadian Stage Company puts on selected Shakespearean plays in the park&#x27;s amphitheatre. The amphitheatre is on the hill side directly to the east of the Grenadier Cafe and seats a few hundred people. The annual event is called &quot;Shakespeare in High Park&quot; and is popular with Torontonians.

==Recreation==

There are two main children&#x27;s playgrounds in High Park. There is a playground in the northwest quadrant with a wading pool, picnic areas and snack bar. In a hollow in the south-east corner of the park, an &#x27;adventure playground&#x27; for children was assembled by volunteers in 1999. It consists of wooden play structures with a &quot;castle&quot; theme, plus some swings. The playground is named after Jamie Bell, a volunteer who initially pioneered the idea. In March 2012, a portion of the wooden play structures was burned down in an act of arson. A new castle, created by Mike Holmes and landscape architect Janet Rosenberg, was rebuilt on the weekend of July 7–8, 2012 by volunteers. Another small play area is in the ravine just north of Grenadier Pond.

Dogs are welcome in the park. There is a large &quot;off-leash&quot; area to the north-east of the Grenadier Cafe. In the rest of the park, dogs must remain on-leash.

There are unpaved dirt trails throughout High Park that are for hikers and walkers only. Cycling is prohibited (by law) on unpaved trails and roads in the park to prevent erosion and disturbance. Several of the former roadways within the park have been closed to automotive traffic, but are still accessible to pedestrians and cyclists. In the winter, the hiking paths are maintained for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.

A municipal swimming complex is open during the summertime, with a water slide, a splash pad and a shallow wading area. , there is no admittance fee for its use. The pool is supervised by lifeguards.

Skating on Grenadier Pond was banned by the Toronto Parks Department starting in 2001, but it remained a favourite skating location for Torontonians in the west end of the city for skating and shinny. In the past, the &quot;old&quot; City of Toronto flooded the surface from holes drilled in the ice and cleared areas for rinks. In 2015, Toronto City Council voted to fund a $25,000 ice monitoring program and legalize skating again. A record cold winter in 2015 had seen many people skating on the ice despite bylaw officers attempting to write $125 tickets. Ice conditions are now monitored annually by the City of Toronto Parks and Recreation staff and the ice condition posted on the City of Toronto&#x27;s website. Grenadier Pond is the only open body of water on which skating is permitted by the City of Toronto.

Tobogganing used to be a popular pastime in the park. It is only done now at the hill at Howard Park Avenue and Parkside Drive. Several toboggan runs existed in the past in the hillside gardens area, and the &quot;bowl&quot; at the bottom of an old toboggan run still exists just east of Grenadier Pond, to the north-west of Grenadier Cafe, for a run that started at West Road and ended at the bowl next to the pond. The run is no longer used and trees block the run.

===Sports facilities===
In the central area of the park, there are two soccer fields and three baseball diamonds available for organized play. One of the baseball diamonds is home to the High Park baseball organization, providing &quot;Little League&quot; organized baseball programs for children. The smallest diamond is for T-Ball play and the larger field behind the little league diamond is for older players. Next to the little league diamond is the High Park swimming pool. In the winter, an ice hockey ice rink is operated to the north of High Park Pool. The rink was refurbished in 2009 after donations by the Toronto Maple Leafs and retailer The Home Depot.

There are several tennis courts in two separate locations. There are concrete courts along Colborne Lodge Road, to the north of the Pool, operated by the High Park Tennis Club. Along Parkside Drive, between Howard Park Avenue and Bloor Street, is a set of tennis courts and a club house, operated by the Howard Park Tennis Club.

High Park was used for cycling events for the 2017 Invictus Games, replacing Toronto Islands which was still recovering from flooding during the spring and summer.

==Friends of the Park==
The Volunteer Stewardship Program (VSP) is a volunteer group working with City of Toronto Urban Forestry and Horticulture staff, to protect and restore the remaining natural areas of High Park including large areas of Savannah with Black Oak trees and related flora and fauna. Spring, summer and fall activities include planting, collecting seeds, and removing invasive species from restoration sites. There are educational presentations and some greenhouse work in winter. The High Park Natural Environment Committee volunteer committee advises the city on environmental issues in the park. The groups have developed a web site &quot;highparknature.org&quot; with extensive information about High Park.

==Surrounding neighbourhoods==

High Park also lends its name to two neighbourhood names used by the City of Toronto, &quot;High Park–Swansea&quot; and &quot;High Park North&quot; adjoining the Park. High Park-Swansea encompasses the area west of Roncesvalles Avenue, to Bloor Street on the north, and the Humber River on the west, which includes High Park itself. High Park North encompasses the area to the east of Runnymede Road, north of Bloor Street, north to Annette Street and Humberside Avenue, and east to the CNR/CPR railway lines east of Dundas Street.

High Park North is within the boundaries of the former town of West Toronto Junction. These areas were developed in the decades following 1900 and are mainly detached or semi-detached homes. North of High Park, the area has seen extensive developer activity, including several large apartment towers. Residents to the north and east of the park normally call their neighbourhood High Park.

To the west is Swansea, which was once a village based around a metal works. To the south of High Park is the Sunnyside shoreline on Lake Ontario. Along the lake are beaches, several playgrounds, wading pools, Gus Ryder Pool and Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion. The area east of High Park, and south of Bloor Street, is also known as Roncesvalles.

==Monuments and sculptures==

* Monument to John G. and Jemima Howard, benefactors of the park
* Lesya Ukrainka monument, Mykhailo Chereshniovsky, 1975
* Portuguese stone cross (padrão), 25th Anniversary of the Portuguese Community in Canada 1953 to 1978, 1978

In 1967, an area east of Colborne Lodge Road, south of Bloor Street, was the site of the Toronto International Sculpture Symposium and had numerous sculptures installed. Five of the original ten permanent pieces remain in High Park:

* &quot;The Hippie&quot;, William Koochin, 1967
* &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Wessel Couzijn, 1967
* &quot;November Pyramid&quot;, Bernard Schottlander, 1967
* &quot;The Temple&quot;, Hubert Dalwood, 1967
* &quot;Three Discs&quot;, Menashe Kadishman, 1967

==In popular media==
High Park is one of the central settings in the 2015 prize-winning novel &quot;Fifteen Dogs&quot; by Canadian novelist, André Alexis.

==Access==

High Park is accessible by TTC:
* The High Park and Keele subway stations on the Bloor–Danforth subway line
* The 501 streetcar, 506 streetcar and 80 Queensway bus routes
* The 203 High Park bus loops inside the park from Victoria Day to Labour Day

Automobile access is allowed to most of the park, although several roads are closed to vehicular traffic. Parking lots exist at the Bell playground and zoo, at Colborne Lodge, at Grenadier Cafe, High Park pool and the north-western children&#x27;s playground, as well as along some roads. On Sundays in summer, the roads are closed to traffic. Colborne Lodge Road does not allow through traffic from The Queensway beyond the parking lot for the lodge.

People can walk or bicycle to the park along roads and streets and enter from the neighbourhood. They can take the Martin Goodman Trail along Lake Ontario to points south of the park.

<text>Spontaneous fission (SF) is a form of radioactive decay in which a heavy atomic nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei. In contrast to induced fission, there is no inciting particle to trigger the decay; it is a purely probabilistic process.

Spontaneous fission is a dominant decay mode for superheavy elements, with nuclear stability generally falling as nuclear mass increases. It thus forms a practical limit to heavy element nucleon number. Heavier nuclides may be created instantaneously by physical processes, both natural (via the &quot;r&quot;-process) and artificial, though rapidly decay to more stable nuclides. As such, apart from minor decay branches in primordial radionuclides, spontaneous fission is not observed in nature.

Observed fission half-lives range from 60 nanoseconds () to greater than the current age of the universe ().

==History==

Following the discovery of induced fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, Soviet physicists Georgy Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak began conducting experiments to explore the effects of incident neutron energy on uranium nuclei. Their equipment recorded fission fragments even when no neutrons were present to induce the decay, and the effect persisted even after the equipment was moved 60 meters underground into the tunnels of the Moscow Metro&#x27;s Dinamo station in an effort to insulate it from the effects of cosmic rays. The discovery of induced fission itself had come as a surprise, and no other mechanism was known that could account for the observed decays. Such an effect could only be explained by spontaneous fission of the uranium nuclei without external influence.

==Mechanism==
Spontaneous fission arises as a result of competition between the attractive properties of the strong nuclear force and the mutual coulombic repulsion of the constituent protons. Nuclear binding energy increases in proportion to atomic mass number (A), while coulombic repulsion increases with the square of the proton number (Z). Thus, at high mass and proton numbers, coulombic repulsion overpowers the nuclear binding forces, and the nucleus is energetically more stable as two separate fragments than as a single bound system.

Spontaneous fission is usually a slow process, as the nucleus cannot simply jump to the lower energy (divided) state. Instead it must tunnel through a potential barrier, with a probability determined by the height of the barrier. Such a barrier is energetically possible for all &quot;A&quot; ≥ 93, though its height generally decreases with increasing Z, and fission is only practically observed for &quot;A&quot; ≥ 232.

The stability of a nuclide against fission is expressed as the ratio of the Coulomb energy to the surface energy, which can be empirically estimated as the fissility parameter, x: 
formula_1 
with formula_2 and formula_3. For light nuclei, &quot;x&quot; is small and a sizeable fission barrier exists. As nuclear mass increases, so too does the fissility parameter, eventually approaching and exceeding unity, where stability against fission is lost altogether.

Shell effects and nucleon pairing effects may further affect observed half-lives. Decays of odd-A nuclides are hindered by 3–5 orders of magnitude compared to even–even nuclides. The barrier to fission is expected to be zero around &quot;A&quot; = 300, though an island of stability may exist centred around &quot;Z&quot; = 114, &quot;N&quot; = 184.

To date, true ab initio models describing the complete fission process are not possible. Computational theories based on Hartree–Fock or density-functional theory approaches have been developed, however computational complexity makes it difficult to reproduce the full behaviour. The semi-classical liquid-drop model provides a primarily qualitative description of the phenomenology by treating the nucleus as a classical drop of liquid to which quantum corrections can be applied, which provides a useful conceptual picture that matches in part with experimental data, but ignores much of the quantum nature of the system and fails at more rigorous predictions.

In this model, as with a classical liquid drop, a &quot;surface tension&quot; term is introduced which promotes the spherical shape of the nucleus. Acting in opposition is coulombic repulsion term, which acts to increase the distance between repelling proton pairs and thus promotes elongation of the nucleus into an oval shape. As the deformation of the nucleus increases, and particularly for large nuclei due to their stronger coulombic repulsion, the nucleus may find itself in a state where a thin &#x27;neck&#x27; develops, forming a bridge between two clusters of nuclear matter which may exceed the ability of the surface tension to restore the undeformed shape, eventually breaking into two fragments at the &quot;scission point&quot;. Introducing the effects of quantum tunnelling, the nucleus always has a chance to scission which increases with increasing deformation, and may do so even if the deformation is insufficient to trigger rupture of the neck. After separation, both fragments are highly positively charged and therefore gain significant kinetic energy via their mutual repulsion as they accelerate away from each other.

Shape isomers (also called &quot;fission isomers&quot;) are excited nuclear states existing before scission which may deviate from the spherical geometry, increasing nuclear deformation compared to the ground state without undergoing full fission. These states are &#x27;metastable&#x27; – a nucleus is this state may, on timescales between nanoseconds and microseconds, either decay back to the ground state via gamma-emission, or tunnel through the scission barrier and break apart. Should the nucleus find itself in this state, either through quantum tunnelling or via random statistical fluctuation, the barrier for fission is much reduced, as shape isomers are always at a higher energy level than the ground sate and therefore are no longer required to tunnel through the entire barrier. The resulting increased probability for fission reduces the effective half-life of the nuclide. Triple-humped barriers have been suggested for some nuclear species such as , further reducing its observed half-life.

===Products===
Fission fragments are usually neutron-rich and always generated in excited states. Thus, daughter decays occur rapidly after scission. Decays occurring within 10−13 s of scission are termed &quot;prompt&quot; and are initially dominated by a series of neutron emissions which remain the dominant decay mode until the fragment energy is reduced to the same order of magnitude as the neutron separation energy (approximately ), when photon emission becomes competitive. Below the neutron separation energy, gamma emission is dominant, characterised by a disordered spectrum of gamma energies with characteristic low-energy peaks corresponding to specific decays as the daughter descends the yrast line, each decay carrying away excess angular momentum. Average total prompt gamma emission is 30% higher from the lighter fragment compared to the heavier, implying the heavier fragment is created with higher initial angular momentum. Finally, internal conversion and x-ray emission complete the prompt emissions. Daughter products created by prompt decays are often unstable against beta-decay, and further photon and neutron emissions are also expected. Such emissions are termed &#x27;delayed emissions&#x27; and take place with half-lives ranging from picoseconds to years.

As a result of the large number of decay pathways presented to a fissioning nucleus, there is a large variation in the final products. Fragment masses are normally distributed about two peaks centred at &quot;A&quot; ≈ 95 and &quot;A&quot; ≈ 140. Spontaneous fission does not favour equal-mass fragments, and no convincing explanation has been found to explain this. In rare instances (0.3%), three or more fission fragments may be created. Ternary products are usually alpha-particles, though can be as massive as oxygen nuclei.

Total energy release across all products is approximately , mostly observed as kinetic energy of the fission fragments, with the lighter fragment receiving the larger proportion of energy. For a given decay path, the number of emitted neutrons is not consistent, and instead follows a gaussian distribution. The distribution about the average, however, is consistent across all decay paths. Prompt neutrons are emitted with energies approximated by (but not precisely fitting) a Maxwell distribution, peaking between 0.5 and 1 MeV, with an average energy of and maximum energy of approximately . Prompt gamma emission constitutes a further 8 MeV, while beta decay and delayed-gammas contribute a further and respectively. Less than 1% of emitted neutrons are emitted as delayed neutrons.

==Applications==
The most common application for spontaneous fission is as neutron source for further use. These neutrons may be used for applications such as neutron imaging, or may drive additional nuclear reactions, including initiating induced fission of a target as is common in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.

In crystals containing high proportions of uranium, fission products generated via spontaneous fission produce damage trails as the fragments recoil through the crystal structure. The number of trails, or fission tracks, may be used to estimate the age of a sample via fission track dating.

<text>The Primitive Advent Christian Church is a small body of Adventist Christians which separated from the Advent Christian Church. They have a common early history. Adventists who had adopted the &quot;conditional immortality&quot; views of Charles F. Hudson and George Storrs formed the &quot;Advent Christian Association&quot; in Salem, Massachusetts in 1860.

Like Primitive Baptists, and Primitive Methodists the &quot;Primitive Advent Christian Church&quot; uses the modifier Primitive to signify the idea that they represent the original teachings of the church. They differ from the parent body mainly in two points. They observe feet washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as &quot;rebaptism&quot;.

Officers in the &quot;Primitive Advent Christian Church&quot; are pastors, elders and deacons. A conference for church business is conducted annually.

The church had 427 members in 9 congregations in 1990, all of which were located in central West Virginia.

<doc id="409538" wikidata="Q5182676" url="?curid=409538" title="Crato Formation">
<text>The Crato Formation is a geologic formation of Early Cretaceous (Aptian) age in northeastern Brazil&#x27;s Araripe Basin. It is an important Lagerstätte (undisturbed fossil accumulation) for palaeontologists. The strata were laid down mostly during the Aptian age, about 113 million years ago. It thought to have been deposited in a semi-arid lacustrine wetland environment.

The Crato Formation earns the designation of Lagerstätte due to an exceedingly well preserved and diverse fossil faunal assemblage. Some 25 species of fossil fishes are often found with stomach contents preserved, enabling paleontologists to study predator-prey relationships in this ecosystem. There are also fine examples of pterosaurs, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates (particularly insects), and plants. Even dinosaurs are represented: a new maniraptor was described in 1996. The unusual taphonomy of the site resulted in limestone accretions that formed nodules around dead organisms, preserving even soft parts of their anatomy.

== History ==

Fish fossils in the area were noted in 1823. When they were first methodically published, in 1993, the Crato Formation limestones provided a new site for pterosaurs, one that also preserved insects that fell into a brackish lagoon and semionotid fish preserved in phosphatized nodules. The fossils are usually compacted and preserved in layers of limestone. Fossil Odonata (dragonflies) and damselflies are especially rich in the Crato lagerstätte: currently 384 specimens have been recovered, 264 adults and 120 larvae. Hemiptera (true bugs) and Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets) are also abundant in number of species and in number of specimens. There are also plant remains.

Local mining activities for cement and construction damage the sites. Trade in illegally collected fossils has sprung up in the last decade, driven by the remarkable state of preservation and beauty of these fossils and amounting to a considerable local industry. An urgent preservation program is being called for by paleontologists.
In addition, the weathering of Crato and Santana Formation rocks has contributed soil conditions unlike elsewhere in the region. The Araripe manakin (&quot;Antilophia bokermanni&quot;) is a very rare bird that was discovered only in the late 20th century; it is not known from anywhere outside the characteristic forest that grows on the Chapada do Araripe soils formed ultimately from Crato and Santana Formation rocks.

=== Definition ===
The Crato Formation has often historically been considered the lowest member of the Santana Formation (or, alternatively, the Araripina Formation) of the Araripe Group, later redefined as the Romualdo Formation of the Santana Group. The Crato Member is the product of a single phase, where complicated sequence of sediment strata reflect changeable conditions in the opening sea. The age of this strata has been controversial, though most workers have agreed that it lies on or near the Aptian-Albian boundary, about 112 million years ago.

The extent of the Crato unit and its relationship to the Romualdo Formation had long been ill-defined. It was not until a 2007 volume on the unit by Martill, Bechly and Loveridge that the Crato Formation was given a formal type locality, and was formally made a distinct formation separate from the Santana, which is about 10 Ma younger. The Crato Formation is considered time equivalent with the Paracuru Formation.

<text>The national flag of Libya () was originally introduced in 1951, following the creation of the Kingdom of Libya. It was designed by Omar Faiek Shennib and approved by King Idris Al Senussi who comprised the UN delegation representing the three regions of Cyrenaica, Fezzan, and Tripolitania at UN unification discussions. 

The flag was abolished following the fall of the Kingdom in 1969, and the leader Muammar al-Gaddafi had implemented a few other different flags since then, but it was ultimately readopted by the National Transitional Council following the fall of Gaddafi on 3 August 2011.

The flag consists of a triband red-black-green design, the central black band being twice the width of the outer bands. A white star and crescent is located in the center of the flag.

==History==
The first Libyan flag design was based on the banner of the Senussi dynasty from Cyrenaica, which consisted of a black field and star and crescent design, and was later used as the flag of the region.

Omar Faiek Shennib, Chief of the Royal Diwans, Vice President of the National Assembly and Minister of Defense under King Idris Al Senussi is credited in the memoirs of Adrian Pelt, UN commissioner for Libya (1949 to 1951) for the design of the original flag of Libya.
According to Pelt:
&quot;during deliberations of the Libyan National Constitutional Convention, a paper drawing of a proposed national flag was presented to the convention by Omar Faiek Shennib (distinguished member of the delegation from Cyrenaica). The design was composed of three colours: red, black and green, with a white crescent and star centered in the middle black stripe. Mr. Shennib informed the delegates that this design had met the approval of His Highness Emir of Cyrenaica, King Idris Al Senussi (later to become King of Libya). The assembly subsequently approved that design.&quot;

This flag represented Libya from its independence in 1951 until the 1969 Libyan coup d&#x27;état. The symbolism of the star and crescent in the flag of the Kingdom of Libya was explained in an English language booklet, &quot;The Libyan Flag &amp; The National Anthem&quot;, issued by the Ministry of Information and Guidance of the Kingdom of Libya (year unknown) as follows: &quot;The crescent is symbolic of the beginning of the lunar month according to the Muslim calendar. It brings back to our minds the story of Hijra [migration] of our Prophet Mohammed from his home in order to spread Islam and teach the principles of right and virtue. The Star represents our smiling hope, the beauty of aim and object and the light of our belief in God, in our country, its dignity and honour which illuminate our way and puts an end to darkness.&quot;
In 2011, interviews with Ibtisam Shennib and Amal Omar Shennib, Omar Faeik Shennib&#x27;s only two remaining children, were cited as confirming Pelt&#x27;s account of the origin of the flag. 
Ibtisam Shennib recalled the morning her father brought a draft of the flag to the breakfast table and showed it to her and her siblings, explaining the original intent behind the selection of the flag&#x27;s colours and symbols. According to Omar Faiek Shennib, &quot;red was selected for the blood sacrificed for the freedom of Libya, black to remember the dark days that Libyans lived under the occupation of the Italians and green to represent its primary wealth, agriculture, [Libya once being referred to as the &#x27;agricultural basket&#x27; or &#x27;breadbasket&#x27; of the Ottoman Empire] and the future prosperity of the country. The star and crescent were placed within the black central strip of the flag as a reference to the Senussi flag and the role of King Idris in leading the country to independence&quot;. The flag&#x27;s colours also echo the colours of the flags of the three regions of Libya: Fezzan (red), Cyrenaica (black), and Tripolitania (green).

Under Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s leadership, Libya had a red-white-black flag from 1969 to 1977, and it was replaced by the all-green flag from 1977 to 2011, during which it was the only national flag in the world to have one colour and no design. 

During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad.
The National Transitional Council, formed on 27 February 2011, adopted the flag previously used in the Kingdom of Libya between 1951 and 1969 as the &quot;emblem of the Libyan Republic&quot;. The flag was officially defined in article three of the Libyan Draft Constitutional Charter for the Transitional Stage:

The national flag shall have the following shape and dimensions:

Its length shall be double its width, its shall be divided into three parallel coloured stripes, the uppermost being red, the centre black and lowest green, the black stripe shall be equal in area to the other two stripes together and shall bear in its centre a white crescent, between the two extremities of which there shall be a five-pointed white star.
On 10 March 2011, France was the first country to recognise the council as the official government of Libya, as well as the first to allow the Libyan embassy staff to raise the flag. On 21 March, the flag was flown by the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations and appeared on their official website, and thereafter in late August by the Arab League and by Libya&#x27;s own telecommunications authority, the Libya Telecom &amp; Technology, on its own website. In the following months many other Libyan embassies replaced the green flag of Gaddafi with the tricolour flag.

This original flag of Libya is now the only flag used by the United Nations to represent Libya, according to the following UN statement: 
&quot;Following the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 66/1, the Permanent Mission of Libya to the United Nations formally notified the United Nations of a Declaration by the National Transitional Council of 3 August 2011 changing the official name of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to &#x27;Libya&#x27; as well as a decision to change Libya&#x27;s national flag to the original.&quot; All Libyan diplomatic posts, such as embassies and consulates, use the original flag of Libya. 

==Legal basis and construction==
The flag of Libya is described in Article 7 of the Constitution of 7 October 1951. It was officially adopted on 24 December 1951. The passage from the constitution reads:

Both the precise shade and legal construction is described in a booklet issued by the Ministry of Information and Guidance of the Kingdom of Libya in 1951. The passage reads:

<text>The New Communist Party of Britain is an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party in Britain. The origins of the NCP lie in the Communist Party of Great Britain from which it split in 1977. Opposed to Eurocommunism, the party was one of two original British signatories to the Pyongyang Declaration in 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union. It publishes a newspaper named &quot;The New Worker&quot;.

==Formation==
The driving force behind the formation of the New Communist Party in 1977 was Sid French, who had been the CPGB&#x27;s Surrey district secretary for many years. French was born into a class-conscious working class family in 1920 and joined the Young Communist League in 1934, at the age of 14. In 1941, during the Second World War, he was called up and served in the Royal Air Force. Promoted to sergeant in 1942, French was posted to Gibraltar and later to North Africa and Italy. While on active service he wrote an article for &quot;Labour Monthly&quot; about the problems facing the Gibraltarians under war conditions. In Algiers he met Henri Alleg, a French Communist journalist, who later joined the Algerian resistance against French colonialism and spent five years in prison for his activities. After postwar demobilisation French&#x27;s commitment to the Communist movement led to his appointment as Secretary of the newly formed Surrey District Committee of the CPGB in 1950. He remained in that position until he resigned, together with other supporters, to establish the New Communist Party on 15 July 1977. Sid French was a member of the General and Municipal Workers Union (G&amp;MWU) and an active co-operator. He was elected to the Political Purposes Committee of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS) in 1967 and elected to the RACS Members&#x27; Council in 1968.

==Divisions within the CPGB==
Divisions within the CPGB had emerged following the Soviet intervention to quell the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and the subsequent moves by the Nikita Khrushchev leadership in the USSR to denounce Joseph Stalin. The split within the international communist movement that eventually polarised between the positions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was not a major contributing factor and the groups that supported the CCP position had little support within the CPGB. French remained staunchly loyal to the Soviet Union though privately he opposed the Khrushchev line. What he did have in common with those who eventually left to form their own organisations was a common belief that the CPGB&#x27;s policy, known as the &quot;British Road to Socialism&quot; (BRS), was a major revision of Marxist–Leninist principles and was essentially a left social democratic and reformist programme.

In the eyes of French and like-minded observers, the CPGB leadership under John Gollan used the Hungarian crisis and the denunciation of what Khrushchev called Stalin&#x27;s &quot;cult of personality&quot; to weaken and divide the party as a whole. The &quot;British Road to Socialism&quot;, was first revised in 1957 - the start of a process culmination in 1977 which, for French, deprived it of all revolutionary content.

In 1966, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was re-launched as &quot;The Morning Star&quot; - French had been among those who had campaigned against this change. The CPGB leadership&#x27;s decision to support the Dubček leadership in Czechoslovakia and oppose the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact intervention in 1968 that led to Dubček&#x27;s removal widened the divisions within the CPGB.

In 1964 Labour returned to power after 13 years of Conservative rule but the new government under Harold Wilson pursued policies seen by many leftists as anti-union (including an attempt to introduce &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; compulsory arbitration), while in Northern Ireland the government was seen by many in the Catholic community as supporting its oppression following the collapse of the civil rights campaign. The Tories, under Edward Heath, returned to power in 1970 with policies even more unpopular with the British left, contributing to the largest number of strikes involving the greatest number of workers in British history. Miners&#x27; strikes in 1972 and 1974 featured widespread participation from the working class and other sectors. Heath was defeated in 1974 and in the eyes of many on the British left, the second Wilson government continued where it left off.

French and like-minded British communists saw the Wilson/Callaghan government of 1974–79 as implementing &quot;class collaborationist&quot; policies and felt this was becoming more obvious to the working class, but believed the CPGB was incapable of presenting a clear revolutionary perspective, and had no capacity to rally workers on a mass scale against the capitalist offensive. French and others believed that at a moment of profound crisis for social democracy, their party was impotent and unable to wage a struggle for communist policies.

It was during this period of struggle and change that the CPGB declined at an alarming rate. It became more isolated from the people than at any other time in its history. The decline in membership and &quot;Morning Star&quot; circulation accelerated. The Young Communist League collapsed, while the growing crisis in the party also affected the credibility of its leadership as formerly senior and influential members left its ranks. In 1976, four of the party&#x27;s top engineering activists resigned: Bernard Panter, Cyril Morton, Jimmy Reid and John Tocher, who had all been members of the Political Committee. At the base of the party the crisis in organisation was even more clear. Thousands of members were no longer organised and many did not even pay their nominal 25p monthly dues.

Warring camps emerged within the party. Since the 1960s a secret faction known as the &quot;Smith Group&quot; and later as the &quot;Party Group&quot; had operated within the CPGB based around the theories of the Italian communist leader Antonio Gramsci. This provided the political base for the emergence of an open Eurocommunist faction in the early 1970s. The Gollan leadership sought to prop itself up by aligning itself with the Eurocommunist forces further to their right. Within that camp was an active faction that called itself the &quot;Revolutionary Democratic Current&quot;.

On the other side, a group led by former CPGB student organiser Fergus Nicholson was emerging that later became &quot;Straight Left&quot;; while French&#x27;s Surrey District committee refrained from faction fighting which would have led to disciplinary action.

But the crisis came to a head the following year in the run-up to the Congress in November. The Gollan leadership had redrawn the British Road to Socialism aimed at - according to its detractors - adopting a social-democratic platform that sought the respectability and acceptance of academic and intellectual circles. The hardliners claimed it was the party&#x27;s entrance fee into the reformist and social democratic traditions of the official labour movement. The publication of the draft and the beginning of the pre-Congress discussion period led to furious arguments within the party - with the majority saying that the new programme was about building a broad alliance for revolutionary social change, though implicitly or explicitly agreeing that the proposals broke with the Leninist tradition.

The Nicholson group argued that all the opposition should focus on making a stand at the November 1977 Congress. French led discussions with Nicholson and he was ready to go along with this strategy. But when it became clear that the party leadership was going to strike the first blow by expelling Sid French and a number of others in the Surrey district the formation of a new party became inevitable. On 15 July 1977 the New Communist Party was established at an emergency meeting in London called by French and other members of the Surrey district committee.

Support came largely from French&#x27;s Surrey district stronghold though other supporters of his position, who had been contacted during the campaign against the new draft of the BRS, also joined immediately. But the decision to form the party in July had been made at the last moment. It took a further six weeks to organise the production of a party weekly, &quot;The New Worker&quot;, and issue the first pamphlet arguing the case for the new party.

The NCP failed to take many members in key districts of the CPGB, such as London, Scotland and South Wales in the run-up to the November CPGB Congress. There, Nicholson&#x27;s supporters were overwhelmingly defeated and the new draft BRS adopted. The Nicholson group continued to oppose the CPGB leadership in an increasingly factional way while claiming that French&#x27;s move had undermined the overall opposition at Congress. But the opposition had no chance of defeating the draft. Even if French&#x27;s supporters had been at Congress their numbers together with Nicholson&#x27;s group were still not enough to defeat the leadership bloc&#x27;s support.

Some 6,000 members had left the CPGB by the end of 1977 in a membership decline that would accelerate throughout the 1980s. But only a fraction of them, put at around 700, joined the NCP.

==The New Communist Party==
Sid French became the first General Secretary of the NCP and Surrey became its strongest area. The first national chairman was Joe Parker, a full-time official in the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Coppersmiths (NUSMWC) until he retired in 1982. Joe Parker stepped down as Party Chairman soon after but remained an active NCP member until his death in 2004.

French died in 1979 and was succeeded by Eric Trevett. Trevett retired from full-time Party work in 1995 but remained on the Politburo of the Central Committee of the NCP as Party President, a post created in that year, until his death in September 2014.

Like the rest of the British communist movement the NCP from the beginning had to deal with what they saw as ultra-leftism and right-wing deviation. All were defeated at congresses over the years and many were expelled for factionalism. In the early 1980s an extreme pro-Soviet faction called &quot;Proletarian&quot; was expelled. In the early 1990s another small group was expelled which later formed the Communist Action Group.

The party&#x27;s &#x27;Vote Labour Everywhere&#x27; strategy was changed in 2000 to support Ken Livingstone for London Mayor and this ultimately led to the biggest purge in the party&#x27;s history. A vote at the central committee with a one-vote majority led to nine expulsions from the party of those opposed to the Livingstone decision for factionalism, and some subsequent resignations, including nine members of the central committee. The North West District was dissolved and altogether around 25 members were either expelled for factionalism or resigned from the party.

One of the NCP&#x27;s better-known members was Ernie Trory (1913–2000), who founded the Crabtree Press to publish his political and historical writings. Three volumes, &quot;Between the Wars, Imperialist War&quot; and &quot;War of Liberation&quot;, all sub-titled &quot;Recollections of a Communist Organiser&quot;, cover unfolding political events from the Depression to the end of the Second World War.

The General Secretary is Andy Brooks, a founder member of the NCP and a member of the Central Committee since 1979. He had previously been international secretary, editor of &quot;The New Worker&quot; and deputy general secretary.

The NCP has never stood candidates in general or local elections and calls for support for the Labour candidates. This policy was amended in 2000 to permit support for independent Labour candidates with mass support and the NCP backed Ken Livingstone&#x27;s successful bid for the London Mayorship.

The NCP is also a supporter of the Liaison Committee for the Defence of Trade Unions, a rank and file union committee supported by a number of left-leaning trade union leaders.

The NCP has been opposed to the European Union and the Treaty of Rome, and while the UK was still a member state it called on its supporters to boycott elections to the European Parliament.

The organisational structure of the NCP consists of Fractions, Cells, District Committees, Central Committee, and Political Bureau (Politburo). The highest body of the party is the National Congress, which determines policy and elects the Central Committee.

It produces a weekly newspaper called &quot;The New Worker&quot;. For the first two years the paper was commercially printed but in 1979 production became entirely in-house with the purchase of an off-set litho press. Content is written either internally, or comes from other sources, particularly organs of fraternal parties. It no longer has a theoretical journal, having ended publication of the &quot;New Communist Review&quot; in the mid-1990s following the death of its editor George Woolley. In the 1980s and early 1990s the NCP also published an &quot;Industrial Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Economic Bulletin&quot;. It produces &quot;Internal Bulletin&quot; for members and supporters, as well as various pamphlets on different subjects.

The New Communist Party of Britain gave its endorsement to the Labour Party for the 2019 United Kingdom general election.

==Ideology==
The NCP began internally to criticise Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s leadership of the Soviet Union in 1988 and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union established relations with communist and workers&#x27; parties globally. In the 1990s Party Congresses adopted resolutions repudiating and denouncing Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s anti-Stalin 20th Congress speech (Secret Speech) and defining its ideology around the &quot;great revolutionary teachers of humanity, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin&quot; and the &quot;great revolutionary leaders of the struggling masses, Mao Zedong, Kim Il Sung, Fidel Castro and Ho Chi Minh&quot;.

In April 1992 the NCP was one of the initial signatories of the Pyongyang Declaration, along with 77 other communist, workers, socialist and progressive parties worldwide. Entitled &quot;Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism&quot;, this was the first statement made by the international communist movement since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and by 2007 has been signed by 300 parties.

In 2003 the NCP adopted an entirely new rule book with the aim of building a monolithic party and based on the principles of the old Communist International.

The party is politically closest to undiluted, orthodox or anti-revisionist communists who see the Soviet leadership from Nikita Khrushchev onwards as stepping away from socialism. Internationally it broadly supports Cuba, China, Vietnam, Laos and North Korea.

The NCP regularly attends the international conferences organised by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), and May Day events organised by the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium (PTB/PvdA).

In the UK the NCP has very close relations with the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist), despite having major programmatic differences on the question of the Labour Party and how to engage with North Korea.

The NCP supports the Stop the War Coalition and has taken part in its demonstrations.

<text>Lord Havelock Vetinari (, ), Lord Patrician (Primus inter pares) of the city-state of Ankh-Morpork, is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series. Vetinari has written an unpublished manuscript known as &quot;The Servant&quot;, the Discworld version of &quot;The Prince&quot; by the Italian statesman and diplomat Niccolò Machiavelli.

== Fictional biography ==

=== Early years ===
Lord Vetinari was born into the extremely powerful Vetinari family (a pun on the real-life family of the Medici and on the word &quot;veterinary&quot;) and raised by his aunt, Lady Roberta Meserole.

As a youth, he enrolled in the Assassins&#x27; Guild which, apart from teaching its students how to kill other people for money, also gives them an excellent academic education. Lord Vetinari was particularly interested in the classical arts and, in flagrant defiance of the Guild&#x27;s conventions of style, camouflage, though he failed his stealth examination (due to the examiner&#x27;s belief that he had never attended any of his classes). However, Lord Vetinari claimed that he religiously attended his classes, pointing out that in a class on an inherently discreet occupation, he was the only student that &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot; visibly present. Because of the similarity his name bore to &quot;veterinary&quot;, he endured the nickname of &quot;Dog-botherer&quot; (cf. &quot;god-botherer&quot;). Vetinari graduated from the Guild with exceptional marks, scoring disconcertingly high in attention to detail. It is also mentioned that he studied languages; in &quot;Jingo&quot; he translates Klatchian for Sergeant Colon, although he flatly denies being able to speak it.

In his late teens, Vetinari was involved in the &quot;Glorious 25th of May&quot; (&quot;Night Watch&quot;), to which his most notable contribution was the non-assassination of the then-Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, Homicidal Lord Winder, at a crowded party. Vetinari was present at Winder&#x27;s death, but although he certainly &quot;intended&quot; to assassinate Winder, his mere arrival was enough to frighten Winder to death. Vetinari was able to drop his bloodless sword beside Winder&#x27;s corpse, unused, and leave – all seemingly unobserved by anyone in the room, save Winder (though it was hinted that the party was arranged for the very purpose of facilitating the occasion of Winder&#x27;s assassination). Vetinari appeared in full Assassin regalia, which Winder regarded as something out of a nightmare. When asked (as was traditional) about who he is and who sent him, he replies, respectively, &quot;Think of me as... your future&quot; and &quot;I come from the city&quot; showing that he already has the concern for the city&#x27;s welfare he later shows.

Later, he fought alongside the remnants of the Night Watch commanded, for want of better, by Sergeant-at-Arms Samuel Vimes (who had travelled backwards through time and was at time going by the name &quot;John Keel&quot;, having to serve as mentor to his younger self, who was already serving as a probationary Constable; the real John Keel had been murdered by Carcer Dunn, a criminal who was also thrust backwards through time along with Vimes) against the remnants of the Cable Street Particulars (colloquially known as the Unmentionables), the late Lord Winder&#x27;s secret police. The effect &quot;Keel&quot; has on Vetinari and the events of 25 May clearly shape Vetinari&#x27;s views on the effective way of running the city (which had helped shape Vimes&#x27;).

Vetinari later journeyed to Überwald on what is known as the Grand Sneer (a parody of Grand Tour); travels of the younger members of rich families to backward areas to see at first hand how inferior they are. There he met the vampire Lady Margolotta. It is implied that the two had some kind of relationship, and stated more clearly that he taught her a lot of what she knows, and vice versa. It was also there that he learnt about the nature of evil after witnessing a mother otter and its pups feeding on a salmon and its roes (&quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;).

=== Rise to power ===
Lord Vetinari succeeded Mad Lord Snapcase, who had been as mad as the name suggests. One of Vetinari&#x27;s earliest actions and a sample of his way of running the city was to legalize Guilds such as those of the Thieves and the &quot;Seamstresses&quot;, which had been active-but-outlawed for years. Their leaders became esteemed members of society and their members insured and licensed. Vetinari also made it clear to them that he knew everything about them, right down to where their wives had their hair done, and where their children played. Therefore, the Guilds did what he asked of them, and eventually, crime was not so much &quot;eliminated&quot; as &quot;organized&quot;. Nowadays, for a modest fee, an Ankh-Morpork citizen may walk the streets confident that he will not be mugged more than a few times per year, and will always receive a receipt.

=== Vetinari&#x27;s golden rule ===
Lord Vetinari&#x27;s political philosophy can be summed up by his belief that what people wish for most is not good government, or even justice, but merely for things to stay the same; the Vetinari family motto is, after all, &quot;Si non confectus, non reficiat&quot; (&quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot;). This does not mean that there are absolutely no changes; however, things that don&#x27;t work are fixed very quickly, even if it does not look like they are at first. In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Mr. Clete expresses a belief that &quot;things that didn&#x27;t work ... got broken&quot;. Perhaps in conjunction with this, Vetinari has an interest in keeping things in smooth, simple working order. For example, Vetinari still maintains an ancient department of the Ankh-Morpork government responsible for ensuring all figures of speech have a basis in fact, on the basis that people who seek this kind of employment must be kept busy, or else they just might do &quot;anything&quot;.

Despite being technically a dictator, Lord Vetinari does not exercise the despotic rule that characterised some of his predecessors. Vetinari is the archetype of a benevolent dictator, in a chilly, inscrutable way. In &quot;The Truth&quot;, he permits the emergence of a free press, and has rarely, if ever, been known to have innocent people just dragged off to dungeons without a trial: The notable exception to this rule are mime artists, whom Vetinari despises. Vetinari banned all mime performances from Ankh-Morpork shortly after taking power. Mime artists who violate the ban usually find themselves hanging upside down in Vetinari&#x27;s scorpion pit while reading a sign saying, &quot;Learn the Words&quot;. This tyrannical &quot;quirk&quot; has been met with either indifference or approval by average Ankh-Morpork citizens.

Morporkians are in no doubt that Vetinari is firmly in charge of the city; the political system of Ankh-Morpork is described as &quot;One Man, One Vote,&quot; in which Vetinari alone is the Man, and he has the Vote. In &quot;Going Postal&quot;, while Vetinari could have ordered an investigation of the Grand Trunk company and their financial endeavours at any time, he did not do so until public opinion allowed it, and only then did he proclaim his right as a &quot;tyrant&quot; to launch such an inquiry. Also, in &quot;Making Money&quot;, he first appears to avoid meddling in the affairs of private business, but suddenly exercises his executive power in closing several prominent banks for audit at the end of the novel. Vetinari is broadly tolerant of individual rights, but highly intolerant of people who place their own interests above those of the city. Beyond this, he arranges for useful but problematical people to &quot;vanish&quot; in one fashion or another. Leonard of Quirm (the Discworld&#x27;s Leonardo da Vinci) &quot;vanished&quot; and spends his time in an airy attic of the palace, quite happy to continue to invent in solitude and occasionally assisting when the City requires his genius (e.g. during the events of &quot;Jingo&quot; and &quot;The Last Hero&quot;). He also recruits condemned criminals with useful skills and traits, arranging for their hanging by an expert hangman who knows exactly how much rope to give a man for them to survive and be enlisted for the good of the city. These are generally offered the choice to work for the city using their unique skills or the &quot;Freedom to take the Consequences&quot;. In &quot;Going Postal&quot;, both Moist von Lipwig and Reacher Gilt were offered the chance to work for the city, but while von Lipwig accepted and was tasked with resurrecting the Postal Service, Reacher Gilt decided to choose the &quot;freedom&quot; of a door which turned out, when chosen, to open into a deep pit. In &quot;Making Money&quot;, Vetinari similarly enlists the services of a remarkably skilled forger Owlswick Jenkins in the designing of unforgeable banknotes, although this was complicated when von Lipwig broke Jenkins out of prison for the same purpose.

=== Staying in power ===
While he is just as unpopular as those that came before him, Lord Vetinari is very much sane, of sound mind and judgment, and very much still alive. He has achieved this by ensuring that even though all power-wielding groups in the city dislike him, they dislike each other even more. He also carefully arranges matters so that a reality which includes him as Patrician is slightly better than one which does not, with the result being that there are only two people who may potentially &quot;benefit&quot; from his death: Carrot Ironfoundersson and Samuel Vimes who are claimants to the extant throne of Ankh along with their associates, on the grounds that they would be &#x27;on top of the pile&#x27; if the city collapsed, as the city&#x27;s rightful heir to the throne and the highest ranking noble respectively. Carrot Ironfoundersson and Samuel Vimes are the captain and commander of the City Watch, and hence are opposed to any kind of coup as part of their dedication to the rule of law. Ironfoundersson is noted by Vimes to be one of the few people who actually &quot;likes&quot; the Patrician, and Vimes, while adamant that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot;, shares the dedication to the city felt by Vetinari and Ironfoundersson. The Assassins&#x27; Guild no longer accepts contracts on the Patrician – he is the only person besides Samuel Vimes to have been taken off the register. He had the highest &quot;official&quot; price for a living being ever: 1 Million Ankh-Morpork Dollars (&quot;Men at Arms&quot;).

In &quot;Thud!&quot;, his rule of the city is likened to a room full of tension, with people bickering and shouting at one another, and &quot;in the middle of it all, one man, quietly doing his own thing&quot;.

Other reasons for the Patrician&#x27;s continued rule include his mastery of diplomacy and manipulation, his distant and menacing air, his ever-present calmness and composure (which, ironically, make other people ill at ease), and his skills as an Assassin; in &quot;The Truth&quot;, another character relates that &quot;Vetinari moved like a snake&quot;.

Additionally, Vetinari organizes grassroots resistance to himself, enabling him to ensure that all plots against him fail, and that the various groups are constantly quarrelling with each other.

Vetinari has created (or at least continued, though he denies it) the use of a team of clerks, sometimes called the &#x27;Dark Clerks&#x27;, who bring him information on just about everything; they serve, among other functions, as accountants, forensic auditors, and a domestic intelligence service.

Vetinari&#x27;s rule over the city seems to be cemented by the general acknowledgement that very little goes on in the city that Vetinari does not know about. Thus, when a visitor stands in audience with the Patrician, they can be assured that &quot;Vetinari&quot; knows exactly why they&#x27;re there, even if the &quot;visitor&quot; does not.

==== Deposition and restoration ====
Several attempts have been made on Vetinari&#x27;s life or position; strangely enough, he seems to be involved in most of them. Shortly after his ascent to office, he was briefly turned into a lizard by a wizard under the influence of a Sourcerer. He was deposed for a time in favour of a pretender king and subsequently a summoned dragon (&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;) and locked up in his own dungeons from which he is able to escape at his leisure.

As seen by Vimes, the door to his cell is very large and heavy, and is absolutely covered in bars, bolts and locks – &quot;on the inside&quot;. All that is found on the outside is a single lock, a key to which Vetinari had hidden in the cell. He has two mottos a ruler should remember when building dungeons: &quot;Never build a dungeon you wouldn&#x27;t want to spend the night in yourself&quot;, and, &quot;Never build a dungeon you can&#x27;t get out of&quot;.

The collection of sentient, loyal rats with access to the dungeons, and much of the palace itself, provides a well-secured backup escape plan; during a conflict with the palace&#x27;s snake and scorpion populations Vetinari provided them with military advice, allowing them to become the palace&#x27;s dominant vermin.

He is shot in the leg with a gonne and walks with an ebony cane (&quot;Men at Arms&quot;). It is rumoured that the cane held a sword that was made of iron from the blood of a thousand men, but this is revealed to be false (&quot;Making Money&quot;); as he says to Moist; &quot;Oh, really. Do I look like a &#x27;sword made of the blood of a thousand men&#x27; ruler?&quot;

A year after the events of &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, he is poisoned with arsenic, which he inhales from the smoke of poisoned candles (&quot;Feet of Clay&quot;). Characteristically, he had caught-on to the ploy, but continued to fake both the symptoms and the evidence of it until the City Watch found out, cutting up the candle to give the impression that it had been burning all night, thus exposing the conspiracy behind the method.

During the brief war with Klatch, Vetinari unexpectedly surrenders unconditionally to martial law. When the island which is both the cause of controversy and the location set for the signing of the surrender treaty sinks into the ocean (again), all the terms of surrender are called off and the Klatchian leader loses face (and his throne), which was Vetinari&#x27;s plan all along. He ends up being congratulated instead of being deposed and exiled (&quot;Jingo&quot;).

Some time later, Vetinari is framed for assault (on Drumknott) and theft from the city treasury. Again, he comes a hair&#x27;s breadth from being deposed (&quot;The Truth&quot;). He is &quot;arrested&quot; by his own Commander of the Watch (Samuel Vimes) for attempted murder, and spends part of the book incarcerated (although it is implied that this was done to keep Vetinari safe until the ultimate culprit was found, Commander Vimes suspecting something suspicious about the entire scenario), feigning unconsciousness throughout the main events, only to &quot;come to&quot; once the mystery was solved. William de Worde works out that it was a plot using a body double for Vetinari. He first becomes suspicious when it occurs to him that if Vetinari had wanted Drumknott dead, Drumknott would undoubtedly be dead.

There have also been numerous attempts on his life by assassins retained by other parties; the universal failure of these attempts (as well as the insight that the city ruled by him is slightly better than it is without him) leads to the Assassins Guild&#x27;s refusal to accept further contracts on Vetinari (&quot;Night Watch&quot;).

=== Notable events during Vetinari&#x27;s rule ===
Vetinari has seen Ankh-Morpork through many unusual events, including the appearance of a Sourcerer (&quot;Sourcery&quot;), a dragon (&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;), a near-civil war (&quot;Men at Arms&quot;), plus one actual war (&quot;Jingo&quot;) and an attempt to destroy the Discworld (&quot;The Last Hero&quot;), as well as the metaphysical crises of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, Music With Rocks In (&quot;Soul Music&quot;), superfluous life force and belief (&quot;Reaper Man&quot;, &quot;Hogfather&quot;), and one major temporal shatter (&quot;Thief of Time&quot;). It is unclear whether even the well-informed Vetinari was aware of the last.

Vetinari has encouraged the growth of the Guilds and public services. The Ankh-Morpork City Watch in particular has flourished, and is an excellent example of the adaptability which has kept Vetinari in office. At the time he rises to power, the Night Watch consists of three incompetents led by a drunk, just how he then wanted it (incapable of fighting crime, which was being efficiently controlled by the government-approved Thieves and Assassins Guilds). The group evolves into a large, efficient, well-oiled machine that facilitates the smooth operation of the city, and that appears to be just how he wants it. It is observed to him on one occasion that if Vimes (and presumably Vimes&#x27; Guards) did not exist, he would have had to invent him; to which he responds &quot;You know... I rather think I did&quot; (&quot;Feet of Clay&quot;).

Ankh-Morpork has given birth to the first newspaper, the &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; (&quot;The Truth&quot;), while the Grand Trunk Clacks Company established the first efficient international communication service from its headquarters there (&quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;).

More recently, he has put into place Moist von Lipwig, who revamps the postal service without costing the taxpayers anything (&quot;Going Postal&quot;). During this, he invents stamps, which are the closest thing Ankh-Morpork had to banknotes until said form of currency makes its debut in &quot;Making Money&quot; (again by von Lipwig).

At some point between &quot;Thud!&quot; and &quot;Making Money&quot;, Vetinari begins planning for a phenomenal redevelopment project of Ankh Morpork titled &quot;The Undertaking&quot; – this seems to have been inspired by the discovery in &quot;Thud!&quot; of an ancient perpetual motion engine – a twin of one which according to Carrot Ironfoundersson powers all of the machinery in one of the largest mines in Uberwald. Rumours around the Undertaking include mention of &quot;underground streets&quot;, &quot;waterproof tunnels&quot; and &quot;new docks&quot;.

== Appearance, habits and miscellaneous ==

Currently in his late forties/early fifties (Sam Vimes noted in &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; that the Patrician was about the same age as he was, and it is shown in &quot;Night Watch&quot; that he was a licensed student Assassin, making him 17 at the time of the main events of the book, when Vimes was 16), Lord Vetinari is tall, thin and dresses all in dusty black, including a black skullcap. In &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, Mustrum Ridcully likens his appearance to a predatory flamingo, if one existed.

His family coat of arms is a plain, simple sable shield, and therefore does not show up against the black coach in which Vetinari travels – black on black (upon which Moist von Lipwig in &quot;Going Postal&quot; comments that &quot;&quot;you had to admit that the bastard had style&quot;). His family motto is &quot;Si non confectus, non reficiat&quot; (If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it).

Lord Vetinari lives and works in the Patrician&#x27;s Palace, which used to be the Royal Winter Palace. He sits on a plain wooden chair at the feet of the Golden Throne of Ankh (much like the Steward of Gondor in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). The Throne remains untouched despite being allegedly made of gold, but Vetinari reveals to Captain Carrot that it is actually merely gold foil over rotten-through wood.

He accepts interviews in the Oblong Office (a reference to the White House&#x27;s Oval Office). Notably he does not request, or even demand the presence of any of his citizens, but merely has them informed that they &quot;have an appointment with him&quot;, and they are promptly escorted to said appointment. When Vetinari considers the meeting ended, he usually dismisses his visitors with the phrase &quot;don&#x27;t let me detain you&quot;&quot;, the inherent implication being that he just might if they let him.

He holds meetings in the Rats Chamber, so named because of its fresco of dancing rats on the ceiling (a play on the Star Chamber and the German &quot;Ratskammer&quot;, which translates as &quot;council chamber&quot;). Occupants report that spending any time in the room makes one want to leave and go have a good long bath.

His bedroom is spartan; containing little more than a narrow bed and a few battered cupboards. He apparently requires so little sleep and gets up so early that going to bed is merely an excuse to change his clothes (&quot;&quot;He has a bedroom. He presumably sleeps&quot; The New Discworld Companion). He is known to always be in his office at very late (or perhaps early) hours, apparently just coinciding with when someone wishes to see him and he wishes to see them. He is not often described as sleeping (exceptions are in &quot;Jingo&quot; and &quot;The Truth&quot;), although he has been unconscious several times.

He has one known relative (Lady Roberta &quot;Bobbi&quot; Meserole, his aunt) who may come from Genua and lives in Pseudopolis. She appears to share his forté for subtle politics. His father apparently died while Havelock was still young, and, according to his aunt, took things much less seriously than his son does.

Vetinari has no lust for power; though he freely admits that he is a tyrant like his predecessors, he has skilfully arranged matters to ensure that the public prefers his particular form of tyranny over any other. The sole reason for his ruling the city is that he is fiercely loyal to it, although it is also at times been implied that he does it because it amuses him to do so, in the sense that he enjoys outwitting all the people who try to oppose him. He also has no exploitable vices, barring a strange fondness for candied jellyfish – mentioned in the early books but believed by some to be referring to a previous Patrician (see Bibliography). Compared to the previous Patricians of the city, Vetinari appears to be remarkably normal. The only exception to this is his pathological hatred of street mime artists, but this is largely seen as an acceptable quirk.

It was established in &quot;Guards!, Guards!&quot; that Vetinari can communicate with the palace rats. These rats have sentience because of the magic emanating from Unseen University. The rats are loyal to him because he provided them with military advice that, after a conflict with the snakes and scorpions that also inhabited the dungeons, allowed them to become the dominant vermin of the palace. During his imprisonment, as seen in the book, the rats have trouble with specific wording and Vetinari ends up with a book on lace-making in place of the one he desires. He takes the opportunity to learn lace construction anyway, on the principle that one never knows when such a thing may be useful.

Though he excels at the Discworld&#x27;s equivalent of sudoku, &quot;Jikan no Muda&quot; (の; literally, &quot;Waste of Time&quot;&quot; in Japanese), and can solve them after glancing at any grid for a few seconds, he finds them unsatisfying, as numbers are too easy to outwit. He enjoys crosswords far more, as one needs to comprehend how another person&#x27;s mind works when actively trying to mislead. He has found great pleasure in the work of &quot;The Blind Letter Office&quot; at the Post Office, helping to decipher the nigh-illegible gibberish that some of Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s less educated citizenry address their letters with – for example working out casually that &quot;Duzbuns Hopsit pfarmarrsc&quot; equals &quot;K. Whistler, Baker, 3 Pigsty Hill&quot; (Does Buns Opposite the Pharmacy). The men employed for this job are successful in &#x27;translating&#x27; five addresses out of every six, and view Vetinari&#x27;s casual skill at it with something approaching awe. He is also very good at Thud, also known in the books by its Dwarvish name &quot;Hnaflbaflsniflwhifltafl&quot; (a reference to the Germanic-Scandinavian Tafl games, specifically Hnefatafl), and plays it to find his own weaknesses unlike other people (Reacher Gilt, &quot;Going Postal&quot;) who play Thud to find the opponent&#x27;s weaknesses. The &quot;New Discworld Companion&quot; also mentions his mastery of Stealth Chess, a game commonly played by assassins&#x27; guild students and alumni. In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Vetinari is mentioned as preferring to read sheet music rather than listen to music, because the idea of it being performed by people, with all the sweat and saliva involved, strikes him as distasteful.

Lord Vetinari also has a strange clock in his waiting-room. While it does keep completely accurate time overall, it sometimes ticks and tocks out of sync (example: &quot;tick, tock ... ticktocktick, tock ...&quot;) and occasionally misses a tick or tock altogether, which has the net effect of turning one&#x27;s brain &quot;into a sort of porridge&quot;. (&quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, &quot;Going Postal&quot;). In &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; Vimes observes that it must have cost him quite a lot of money.

It has been suggested that Vetinari may not be entirely human, though this is primarily because of his methods and personality, as opposed to any sort of physical proof (although in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, Lady Margolotta was surprised at his lack of aging). Vetinari admits to being &quot;drunk as a skunk&quot; after a banquet at Unseen University, but continues to be startlingly lucid and eloquent, although Drumknott describes him as seeming &quot;unusually talkative&quot;. The only discernible manifestation of his drunkenness: It takes him 15 seconds longer to solve the &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot;″ daily crossword (&quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;).

=== Pets ===
He did keep a pet, a sixteen-year-old wire-haired terrier called Wuffles. It is said that Wuffles is the only living creature Lord Vetinari actually cares about (unless Ankh-Morpork is considered a living creature, to be thought of as &quot;Morporkia&quot;, a nod to &quot;Britannia&quot;). Wuffles has been described as very elderly in two books that take place many years apart. In the novel &quot;Making Money&quot;, it is shown that Wuffles has, at some recent point, died; reinforcing Vetinari&#x27;s affection for the dog is the rumour that every week he makes a short (and via a different path) walk to Wuffles&#x27; small grave in the palace grounds, every time leaving a dog biscuit, though this may be entirely untrue, or may simply be done to add a layer of apparent human weakness to those seeking one.

As of &quot;Making Money&quot; he is now caring for another dog – &quot;Mr. Fusspot&quot;, the former pet of the late Topsy Lavish (née Turvy), Chairwoman of the Royal Bank and Mint. Thanks to an unusual will and Topsy&#x27;s contempt for her in-laws; the rest of the Lavish family, Mr. Fusspot is formally and legally the current chairman. This leads to the debate whether this gives Vetinari control of the bank and mint, since Topsy&#x27;s will states the person caring for Mr. Fusspot is also the executor of &quot;the chairman&#x27;s&quot; wishes for both concerns. The authority rested in Moist von Lipwig, the current Master of the Mint and temporary caretaker of Mr. Fusspot before Vetinari adopted/seized/confiscated the dog. There has been concern over the quality of Vetinari&#x27;s care of the dog, though no one wishes to risk raising the issue with him.

== Bibliography ==
Lord Vetinari makes featured appearances in the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels &quot;Sourcery&quot;, &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, &quot;Jingo&quot;, &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, &quot;The Truth&quot;, &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, &quot;Going Postal&quot;, &quot;Thud!&quot;, &quot;Making Money&quot;, &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, &quot;Snuff&quot; and &quot;Raising Steam&quot;. &quot;Night Watch&quot; features him in his youth.

In &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, Rincewind is brought before &quot;the Patrician&quot; but it is not clear whether this Patrician is Vetinari or his predecessor, Mad Lord Snapcase, or possibly even Homicidal Lord Winder, although the description of this Patrician does not seem to tally with that of Vetinari, as the Patrician in question is, for example, described as obese – a trait his two predecessors did possess, but which he lacks. Pratchett has stated on Usenet that the Patrician in this case is indeed Vetinari, and that he simply lost weight due to the stress of his job. Upon being pressed, he admitted that the only real difference is that he has become a better writer since that time. It is also a reflection of the fact that the Discworld timeline is extremely uncertain.

=== Other media ===
Vetinari was played by Crawford Logan in the 1992 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;. In television adaptations, the character has been portrayed by several actors: Jeremy Irons in TV movie adaptation of &quot;Colour of Magic&quot;, Charles Dance in the TV movie adaptation of &quot;Going Postal&quot;, and Anna Chancellor in the television series &quot;The Watch&quot;. In the video game &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;, his voice was performed by Rob Brydon.

Pratchett&#x27;s own choice of actor to play Vetinari was Alan Rickman.

VLC media player version 3.0 was given the codename Vetinari.

==Reception==
Vetinari was included in a list of the top ten Discworld characters by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2013; Tim Martin describes the character as &quot;The kind of benign despot who would make Machiavelli faint with fear and envy&quot;.

Matthew Sangster, in an article in &quot;Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts&quot;, describes the character&#x27;s &quot;fantastical hypercompetence&quot; as giving Pratchett a means to &quot;skip over certain intricacies to imagine effects, affects, and consequences&quot;. Andrew Rayment, in a wide-ranging article on postmodernity, politics and fantasy in the journal &quot;Postmodern Studies&quot;, characterises Vetinari&#x27;s decision to legalise the Guild of Thieves as a device for Pratchett to parody the fact that &quot;official law is supported by the unwritten supplement that guarantees its functioning&quot;. He discusses Vetinari&#x27;s attitude to journalistic truth and the freedom of the press in &quot;The Truth&quot;, stating that &quot;he understands that part of the ideological role of newspapers is to reproduce already existing values about what the world &quot;is&quot; so that people can recognise&quot; themselves in their world, formulated in the form of news versus Vetinari&#x27;s coinage &quot;olds&quot;, and concluding that &quot;Vetinari, as always, is right&quot;. Rayment goes on to highlight Vetinari&#x27;s use of language, commenting on a scene in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, that the character &quot;change[s] the world with a flick (through) of a thesaurus&quot;.

Gideon Haberkorn, in an article in &quot;Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts&quot;, describes Vetinari as a &quot;realist&quot; who is &quot;no hero&quot;, and who provides a complementary viewpoint to Sam Vimes&#x27;s cynicism and Carrot Ironfoundersson&#x27;s idealism. In a review of &quot;Thud!&quot; for &quot;The Times&quot;, the novelist A. S. Byatt also compares the three characters, describing Vetinari&#x27;s &quot;chess-playing ordering of imperfect social beings&quot; as being, as the series goes on, &quot;ever more subtly&quot; distinguished from Vimes&#x27;s &quot;sense of responsibility for his patch&quot; and Carrot&#x27;s &quot;natural authority and courage&quot;.

<text>The Scott Trust Limited is the British company that owns Guardian Media Group and thus &quot;The Guardian&quot; as well as various other media businesses in the UK. In 2008, it replaced the Scott Trust, which had owned &quot;The Guardian&quot; since 1936. 
In December 2024, the company confirmed the sale of &quot;The Observer&quot; to Tortoise Media. 

The company is responsible for appointing the editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; (and those of the group&#x27;s other main newspapers) but, apart from enjoining them to continue the paper&#x27;s editorial policy on &quot;the same lines and in the same spirit as heretofore&quot;, it has a policy of not interfering in their decisions. The arrangement tends to give editors a long tenure: for example, the last incumbent, Alan Rusbridger, held the position from 1995 until 2015.

The current chairman of the Scott Trust Board is Ole Jacob Sunde, who replaced Alex Graham in 2021. Others on the eleven member board include the current editor-in-chief Katharine Viner, Guardian legal affairs correspondent Haroon Siddique who is the journalist director of the board, and one member of the Scott family.

The Scott Trust is a limited partner in GMG Ventures LP, founded in 2017, according to the GMG 2018 annual report, &quot;this £42m venture capital fund is designed to contribute financial returns and to support GMG’s strategy by investing in early stage businesses focused on developing the next generation of media technology&quot;.

==History==
===1936–1948===
The Trust was established in 1936 by John Russell Scott, owner of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; (as it then was) and the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;. After the deaths in quick succession of his father C. P. Scott and brother Edward, and consequent threat of death duties, John Scott wished to prevent future death duties forcing the closure or sale of the newspapers, and to protect the liberal editorial line of the &quot;Guardian&quot; from interference by future proprietors. The first and only chairman of the first Trust was John Scott.

===1948–2008===
The Trust was dissolved and reformed in 1948, as it was thought that the Trust, under the terms of the original Trust Deed, had become liable to tax due to changes in the law. At this time John Scott also gave up his exclusive right to appoint trustees; the trustees would henceforth appoint new members themselves. Five months after the signing of the new Trust Deed, John Scott died. After three years of legal argument, the Inland Revenue gave up its claim for death duty.

The eight initial trustees of the 1948 Trust were all connected with the Manchester Guardian and Evening News, Ltd., and included four of C. P. Scott&#x27;s grandsons as well as the then editor of the &quot;Guardian&quot;, A. P. Wadsworth. It has become normal practice for a &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist to be a member of the trust, though they are not considered to be a &quot;representative&quot; of the staff, as this may result in a conflict of interests.

In 1992, the Trust identified its central objective:
:&quot;To secure the financial and editorial independence of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition; as a profit-seeking enterprise managed in an efficient and cost-effective manner.&quot;

The Trust saw its main functions as being the following:
*&quot;To secure the Trust&#x27;s own continuity by renewing its membership and by dealing with threats to its existence
*To monitor the organisation, financial management and overall strategy of the Group, holding the Board accountable for its performance
*To appoint and &#x27;in extreme circumstances&#x27; to dismiss the editors of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; (and &quot;The Observer&quot; after its acquisition in 1993)
*To act as a &#x27;court of appeal&#x27; in the event of any dispute between the editorial and managerial sides of the operation.&quot;

The second Trust had five Chairmen over its 60 years: Alfred Powell Wadsworth (1948–56), Richard Farquhar Scott (1956–84), Alastair Hetherington (1984–89), Hugo Young (1990–2003) and Liz Forgan.

===The Scott Trust Limited: 2008–present===
In October 2008, it was announced that the trust was being wound up and its assets transferred to a new limited company named &quot;The Scott Trust Limited&quot; to &quot;strengthen the protection it offers to the Guardian&quot; and because &quot;[l]ike all non-charitable trusts, and unlike limited companies, the Scott Trust has a finite lifespan&quot;. The core purpose of the Trust was enshrined in the constitution of the Limited company and &quot;cannot be altered or amended.&quot;
The new company is barred from paying dividends, and &quot;its constitution has been carefully drafted to ensure that no individual can ever personally benefit from the arrangements.&quot;

In February 2010, the company announced the sale of its GMG Regional Media arm and its regional print titles to the Trinity Mirror Group. The regional titles comprised the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and 31 others in the North West and South of England. The sale was finalised on 28 March 2010 and ended the Scott Trust&#x27;s association with regional newspapers.

In 2012 the Scott Trust Limited became a co-founder of the European Press Prize.

Guardian News and Media, a subsidiary of the Scott Trust Limited, reported a loss of £30.9 million for the year to the end of April 2013.

The company via the Guardian Media Group (GMG, a subsidiary company) completed the sale for £619 million of its 50.1% stake in &quot;Auto Trader&quot; on 4 March 2014. Apax Partners, a venture capital firm, increased its share to become the sole shareholder in the business. The £619 million earned from the sale of &quot;Auto Trader&quot; added to the £253.7 million of cash and investments which GMG published in its 2013 annual report. This left an investment fund which was likely to be in excess of £850 million to underwrite &quot;Guardian&quot; losses.

In December 2014, it was announced that Alan Rusbridger, then &quot;Guardian&quot; editor-in-chief, would succeed Forgan as the chairman of the company in 2016 but he unexpectedly announced on 13 May 2016 his resignation as a director.

As of January 2016, the company&#x27;s funds were £740 million, down from £838.3 million in July 2015.

As of 1 April 2018, the value of the Scott Trust Endowment Fund was £1.01 billion, down slightly from £1.03 billion in 2017.

In 2023, following independent academic research commissioned in 2020 reporting, the trust apologised for the newspaper&#x27;s founders involvement in transatlantic slavery principally through the cotton trade. It announced a £10 million ten-year programme of restorative justice.

In November 2024, Jonathan Paine was appointed to the board of the Scott Trust. Paine is a former managing director and senior adviser at Rothschild &amp; Co.

In early December 2024, the company announced the sale of &quot;The Observer&quot; to Tortoise Media. Two weeks later the company confirmed the deal, and that it had taken a stock position in the purchaser.

==Governance==
Scott Trust Limited was incorporated on 24 September 2008 as &quot;Scott Place 1001 Limited&quot;, and adopted its current name on 3 October 2008; its number is 06706464 and it is a company limited by shares. The Scott Trust Limited is governed according to the articles of association, set up in 2008 and filed at Companies House. The articles say that the board of directors must guard editorial independence. The board appoints itself under article 63, through an appointments committee. Neither workers at the newspapers nor readers participate in voting for board members. Such voting could be allowed with 75% approval of the existing board of directors under article 7.

<doc id="409549" wikidata="Q2317277" url="?curid=409549" title="Talaromyces marneffei">
<text>Talaromyces marneffei, formerly called &quot;Penicillium marneffei&quot;, was identified in 1956. The organism is endemic to southeast Asia, where it is an important cause of opportunistic infections in those with HIV/AIDS-related immunodeficiency. Incidence of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; infections has increased due to a rise in HIV infection rates in the region.

When it was classified as a &quot;Penicillium&quot;, it was the only known thermally dimorphic species of that genus that caused a lethal systemic infection (talaromycosis), with fever and anaemia similar to disseminated cryptococcosis. This contrasted with related &quot;Penicillium&quot; species that are usually regarded as unimportant in terms of causing human disease.

==Epidemiology==
There is a high incidence of talaromycosis in AIDS patients in SE Asia; 10% of patients in Hong Kong get talaromycosis as an AIDS-related illness. Cases of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; human infections (talaromycosis) have also been reported in HIV-positive patients in Australia, Europe, Japan, the UK and the U.S. All the patients, except one, had visited Southeast Asia previously. The disease is considered an AIDS-defining illness.

Discovered in bamboo rats (&quot;Rhizomys&quot;) in Vietnam, it is associated with these rats and the tropical Southeast Asia area. &quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot; is endemic in Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Southern China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.

Although both the immunocompetent and the immunocompromised can be infected, it is extremely rare to find systemic infections in HIV-negative patients. The incidence of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; is increasing as HIV spreads throughout Asia. An increase in global travel and migration means it will be of increased importance as an infection in AIDS sufferers.

&quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot; has been found in bamboo rat faeces, liver, lungs and spleen. It has been suggested that these animals serve as a reservoir for the fungus. It is not clear whether the rats are affected by &quot;T. marneffei&quot; or are merely asymptomatic carriers of the disease.

One study of 550 AIDS patients showed that the incidence was higher during the rainy season, which is when the rats breed. But this season also has conditions that are more favorable for production of fungal spores (conidia), which can become airborne and be inhaled by susceptible individuals.

Another study could not establish contact with bamboo rats as a risk factor, but exposure to the soil was the critical risk factor. However, soil samples failed to yield much of the fungus.

It is not known whether people get the disease by eating infected rats, or by inhaling fungi from their faeces.

One HIV-positive physician is known to have been infected while attending a course on tropical microbiology. He did not handle the organism, though students in the same laboratory did. It is presumed he contracted the infection by inhaling aerosol containing &quot;T. marneffei&quot; conidia. This shows that airborne infections are possible.

==Clinical presentation==
Patients commonly present with symptoms and signs of infection of the reticuloendothelial system, including generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The respiratory system is commonly involved as well; cough, fever, dyspnea, and chest pain may be present, reflecting the probable inhalational route of acquisition. Approximately one-third of patients may also exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea.

==Laboratory diagnosis==
The fact that &quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot; is thermally dimorphic is a relevant clue when trying to identify it. However, it should be kept in mind that other human-pathogenic fungi are thermally dimorphic as well. Cultures should be done from bone marrow, skin, blood and sputum samples.

Plating samples out onto two Sabouraud agar plates, then incubating one at 30 °C and the other at 37 °C, should result in two different morphologies. A mold-form will grow at 30 °C, and a yeast-form at 37 °C.

Mycelial colonies will be visible on the 30 °C plate after two days. Growth is initially fluffy and white and eventually turns green and granular after sporulation has occurred. A soluble red pigment is produced, which diffuses into the agar, causing the reverse side of the plate to appear red or pink. The periphery of the mold may appear orange-coloured, and radial sulcate folds will develop.

Under the microscope, the mold phase will look like a typical &quot;Penicillium&quot;, with hyaline, septate and branched hyphae; the conidiophores are located both laterally and terminally. Each conidiophore gives rise to three to five phialides, where chains of lemon-shaped conidia are formed.

On the 37 °C plate, the colonies grow as yeasts. These colonies can be cerebriform, convoluted, or smooth. There is a decreased production in pigment, the colonies appearing cream/light-tan/light-pink in colour. Microscopically, sausage-shaped cells are mixed with hyphae-like structures. As the culture ages, segments begin to form. The cells divide by binary fission, rather than budding. The cells are not yeast cells, but rather arthroconidia.
Culturing isn&#x27;t the only method of diagnosis. A skin scraping can be prepared, and stained with Wright&#x27;s stain. Many intracellular and extracellular yeast cells with crosswalls are suggestive of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; infection. Smears from bone marrow aspirates may also be taken; this is regarded as the most sensitive method. These samples can be stained with the Giemsa stain. Histological examination can also be done on skin, bone marrow or lymph nodes.

The patient&#x27;s history also is a diagnostic help. If they have traveled to Southeast Asia and are HIV-positive, then there is an increased risk of them having talaromycosis.

Antigen testing of urine and serum, and PCR amplification of specific nucleotide sequences have been tried, with high sensitivity and specificity.
Rapid identification of talaromycosis is sought, as prompt treatment is critical. Treatment should be provided as soon as talaromycosis is suspected.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of talaromycosis depends on the degree of immunosuppression and organ involvement, but most isolates of &quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot; display low MIC&#x27;s to amphotericin B as well as itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole.

== Research ==

===Genomics===

===Sexual reproduction===
&quot;T. marneffei&quot; had been assumed to reproduce exclusively by asexual means based on the highly clonal population structure of this species. However, studies by Henk et al. (2012) revealed that the genes required for meiosis are present in &quot;T. marneffei&quot;. In addition, they obtained evidence for mating and genetic recombination in this species. Henk et al. concluded that &quot;T. marneffei&quot; is sexually reproducing, but recombination in natural populations is most likely to occur across spatially and genetically limited distances resulting in a highly clonal population structure. It appears that sex can be maintained in this species even though very little genetic variability is produced.

=== Mycovirology ===
The study by Lau &quot;et al&quot; (2018) described the first evidence of a mycovirus in a thermally dimorphic fungus. &quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot; &quot;partitivirus&quot;-1 (TmPV1), a dsRNA mycovirus, was detected in 12.7% (7 out of 55) of clinical &quot;T. marneffei&quot; isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TmPV1 occupied a distinct clade among the members of the genus &quot;Gammapartitivirus&quot;. Two virus-free isolates were successfully infected by purified TmPV1 using protoplast transfection. Mice challenged with TmPV1-infected &quot;T. marneffei&quot; isolates showed significantly shortened survival time and higher fungal burden in organs than mice challenged with isogenic TmPV1-free isolates. Transcriptomic analysis showed that TmPV1 causes aberrant expression of various genes in &quot;T. marneffei&quot;, with upregulation of potential virulence factors and suppression of RNA interference (RNAi)-related genes.

=== MicroRNA-like RNAs ===
&quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot; dicer-dependent microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) were identified and these milRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in different growth phases of &quot;T. marneffei.&quot; Furthermore, the phylogeny of RNAi genes of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; were also described in the same study. Phylogenetic analysis of both ITS and &quot;dcl-1&quot; gene showed that the corresponding sequences in &quot;T. marneffei&quot; were most closely related to &quot;Penicillium emmonsii&quot;, &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp. However, phylogenetic analysis of &quot;dcl-2&quot; and &quot;qde-2&quot; genes showed a different evolutionary topology. The &quot;dcl-2&quot; of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; and its homologue in &quot;T. stipitatus&quot; are more closely related to those of the thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi, &quot;Histoplasma capsulatum&quot;, &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot;, &quot;Paracoccidioides brasiliensis&quot; and &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot; than to &quot;P. chrysogenum&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp., suggesting the co-evolution of &quot;dcl-2&quot; among the thermal dimorphic fungi. On the other hand, &quot;qde-2&quot; of &quot;T. marneffei&quot; is most closely related to its homologues in other thermal dimorphic fungi than to that in &quot;T. stipitatus&quot;, &quot;P. chrysogenum&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; spp.

<doc id="409558" wikidata="Q2059989" url="?curid=409558" title="Walk Among Us">
<text>Walk Among Us is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Misfits, released in March 1982 by Ruby Records and its parent label Slash Records. It was the first full-length album to be released by the band, although it was the third to be recorded, after &quot;Static Age&quot; and &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot;. The recording sessions for &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; took place at multiple studios between June 1981 and January 1982, and the album also includes the track &quot;Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight?&quot;, which was recorded live at the Ritz in New York City. The album features a re-recording of the single &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, which was released on October 31, 1979.

&quot;Walk Among Us&quot; was first pressed with cover artwork featuring a pink background, with the band&#x27;s logo in pink. The second pressing introduced a purple background on the cover, though the pink logo remained unchanged. When the album was reissued in 1988 by Ruby Records, the purple cover was retained, but the band&#x27;s logo was changed to a green color. Until 2018, all official vinyl or CD releases of the album in the United States were issued through Ruby, Slash, or Warner Records/Rhino. The album was reissued again on November 30, 2018, by Earache Records, with six limited-run variant colored pressings.

==Recording==
Prior to &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;, the Misfits had recorded and shelved two full-length albums: &quot;Static Age&quot;, which was recorded in 1978 but would remain unreleased in its entirety until 1996, and &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot;, which was recorded in 1980 and has never received an official wide release. The recording sessions for &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; took place at multiple studios. The majority of the songs were recorded at Mix-O-Lydian Studio in Boonton, New Jersey no later than August 1981, and these sessions also produced the recordings for the group&#x27;s single &quot;Halloween&quot;.

The album&#x27;s sixth track, &quot;Hate Breeders&quot;, was recorded at Newfound Sound in Fair Lawn, New Jersey in June 1981. The seventh and only live track on the album, &quot;Mommy, Can I Go Out &amp; Kill Tonight&quot;, was recorded on December 17, 1981, at the Ritz in New York City. As the track fades out, the band can be heard beginning to play the song &quot;London Dungeon&quot;, which was not included on the album in its entirety. In January 1982, overdubbing took place at Quad Teck in Los Angeles, California, where Misfits vocalist Glenn Danzig would also mix the tracks with both Chris Desjardins of the Flesh Eaters and Pat Burnette.

The track &quot;Astro Zombies&quot; takes its name from the title of the 1968 film &quot;The Astro-Zombies&quot;. Additionally, the album title was inspired by the 1956 film &quot;The Creature Walks Among Us&quot;.

==Cover artwork==
The cover for &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; features flying saucers from the 1956 film &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot;, as well as the &quot;Rat-Bat-Spider&quot; creature from the 1959 film &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;. The first pressing of the album in the United States (as well as the Italian-issued import) featured cover artwork with a pink background and logo, whereas the second pressing of the album introduced a purple background, though the pink logo was retained. When the album was reissued in 1988, the cover artwork once again featured a purple background, but the band&#x27;s logo was changed from pink to green. Reissues since 1988 in all formats have varied in usage of either the pink or purple covers. When the album was reissued in 2018 by Earache Records, the colors of the cover artwork were changed again, this time with a pink background and a green logo.

In a 2009 interview with Joe Matera, Danzig expressed his displeasure with the album&#x27;s cover artwork, stating that &quot;I remember I flipped out on our label because it was supposed to be in all these different colors such as red, black and orange but the way it came out was truly awful. But they had already printed them anyway, though they had not shown us any proofs beforehand&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;Walk Among Us&quot; was originally slated for release in 1981 on the band&#x27;s own label, Plan 9 Records, but was neither pressed nor released due to a lack of financing. After several independent labels on the West Coast took interest in releasing the album, and it was released in the United States on 12&quot; LP by Ruby Records, an imprint of Slash Records, in March 1982. The first pressing of &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; featured a pink background and logo, while the second pressing featured a purple background. Danzig began claiming as early as 1983 that &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; had sold over 20,000 copies, and that it sold even greater numbers in overseas markets. Chris Desjardins, who helped mix the album and who operated Ruby Records, has considered Danzig&#x27;s claims about the album&#x27;s sales figures to be most likely inaccurate, as the label&#x27;s most successful releases at the time generally sold between 2,500 and 5,000 copies.

The album was reissued in 1988 on CD and cassette, this time with a green logo, and Warner Bros. circulated promotional copies of the album in approximately 3,000 custom Misfits Halloween bags that year. The album was released in Canada on LP by Slash/London Records in 1996. Until 2018, all official releases of &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; on vinyl or CD in the U.S. were issued through Ruby, Slash, or Warner Records/Rhino.

The album was reissued on November 30, 2018, by Earache Records with six limited-run variant colored pressings, identified by the catalog number MOSH666. The cover artwork for the Earache reissue features a pink background and a green logo, and the vinyl records within were available in a total of six colored variants, limited to 300 each: &quot;&#x27;20 Eyes&#x27; Clear&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Martian&#x27; Green&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Devil&#x27;s&#x27; Purple&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Hatebreeder&#x27; Red&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Hell&#x27; Orange&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;Skull&#x27; White&quot;. Pre-orders for the reissued variants were first announced no later than October 2, 2018, and both the green and purple variants sold out by October 10, 2018.

==Critical reception==

In his book &quot;This Music Leaves Stains: The Complete Story of the Misfits&quot;, author James, Jr. writes that &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; was considered &quot;an instant triumph&quot; among Misfits fans upon its release, and that it was &quot;the record everyone had patiently been waiting for since &quot;Beware&quot; and &#x27;Horror Business&#x27;.&quot; In a May 1982 issue of &quot;Sounds&quot;, music journalist Tim Sommer described it as &quot;a truly awesome album&quot;. &quot;Forced Exposure&quot;″s review of the album stated: &quot;Just [buy] this fuckin&#x27; record&quot;.

Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album a rating of 4.5 out of 5, writing that &quot;Nearly every song on the album – 13 total, delivered in a light-speed 25 minutes – is a twisted classic, with the band&#x27;s trademark &#x27;50s/&#x27;60s melodies run through a punk/metal meatgrinder on full display&quot;. Raggett also wrote that the album &quot;became a legendary effort of U.S. punk, the more so because it so willfully violated many [of punk&#x27;s] rules&quot; at the time of its release, noting that the album is &quot;[u]tterly devoid of political confrontation or social uplift&quot;.

Jason Heller of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a rating of 9.4 out of 10, praising the &quot;insidiously catchy&quot; nature of the songs and writing: &quot;This album is a work of feverish imagination, but it&#x27;s in no way escapist [... Danzig] sings of butchering people and keeping their body parts even as the names Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy sent chills down the spine of a nation. [...] Neither glorifying nor condemning, Misfits simply distilled the anxieties of the early &#x27;80s into a putrid elixir.&quot; Doug Brod of &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing that the album&#x27;s tracks &quot;perfectly capture [the Misfits&#x27;] &quot;danse macabre&quot; before the tempos quickened and the choruses became scarce on 1983&#x27;s &quot;Earth A.D.&quot;&quot;. In his book &quot;The Complete Misfits Discography&quot;, author Robert Michael &quot;Bobb&quot; Cotter calls &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; &quot;one of the greatest officially released punk albums of all time.&quot;

Guitarist Jay Yuenger of the heavy metal band White Zombie called &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; &quot;the definitive statement&quot; from the Misfits, noting its &quot;dangerous sound with sweet melodies [...] it&#x27;s just so unique, and so uniquely American. It made a huge impact on everyone I knew.&quot; Vocalist Dave Brockie of the heavy metal band Gwar called &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; a &quot;nearly perfect album&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album Number 32 on its list of the 40 greatest punk rock albums of all time.

<text>Jason Neil Gillespie (born 19 April 1975) is an Australian cricket coach and former cricketer who played all three formats of the game. Jason Gillespie was appointed as the head coach for Pakistan&#x27;s red-ball (Test) cricket team on April 28, 2024. However, his tenure was short-lived; he resigned in December 2024.

A right-arm fast bowler, he was also a competent lower-order batsman whose unbeaten 201 in his last Test match is the highest score by a night-watchman in international cricket. He was a part of the Australian squad which won the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

Gillespie made his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka at Colombo in the Singer World Series in August 1996, and his Test debut against the West Indies at Sydney in November 1996. He also played for South Australia, Yorkshire and Glamorgan at first-class level, and was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1995.

Gillespie announced his retirement from first-class cricket in Australia in February 2008. He then played in the unauthorised Indian Cricket League for the Ahmedabad Rockets. At the end of the 2008 English domestic season he retired from all first-class cricket.

Jason Gillespie is a descendant on his father&#x27;s side of the Kamilaroi people of Indigenous Australians, and is the first acknowledged Aboriginal male to become a Test cricketer. His mother has Greek heritage and Jason is the eldest of the three children. He attended Cabra Dominican College in Adelaide, South Australia. Gillespie married Anna (née McEvoy) in 2003. The couple have four children.
Gillespie has another daughter from a previous relationship.

Gillespie is a vegan and has criticised dairy farming and the use of leather balls. While coaching Yorkshire, Gillespie said of the club being sponsored by a dairy: &quot;Yes, they are a sponsor but it doesn&#x27;t mean I agree with what they do. It&#x27;s out of my control, just like the fact that cricket balls are made of leather&quot;.

==International career==
=== Bowling ===
Gillespie took 259 wickets in 71 Tests (at an average of 26.13) making him Australia&#x27;s sixth-highest wicket-taker and giving him the 14th best bowling average for Australian bowlers who have taken more than a hundred wickets.

Gillespie seldom dominated a Test series (the most wickets he took in a series is 20), but he was a reliable support bowler over several years for his more famous teammates Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne. For his performances in 2004, he was named both in the World Test XI and ODI XI by the ICC.

=== Batting ===
Glenn McGrath (61) and Gillespie (54*) shared a last-wicket stand of 114 against New Zealand in 2004 at the Gabba to the hilarity and acclaim of their teammates. It was the first time that either of them had made a 50 in either Test or ODI versions of the game.

In the second Test against Bangladesh at Chittagong on 19 April 2006, Gillespie (201 not out) set the world record (on his 31st birthday) for the highest individual score by a nightwatchman. This was his maiden first-class century. He also shared a fourth-wicket partnership of 320 runs with Michael Hussey. Gillespie was awarded man-of-the-match honours for his double century in the first innings and he was also named man of the series for his efforts that included eight wickets, at an average of 11.3. Due to injury, it was his final match in international cricket. As of 2024, Gillespie is the only nightwatchman to score a double century in a Test match.

=== Injuries ===

He played only 52 from a possible 92 Tests following his debut to his axing during the 2005 Ashes series. Despite these problems, he was both accurate and economical.

In Australia&#x27;s 1999 tour of Sri Lanka, he was involved in a sickening outfield collision when both he and Steve Waugh were running to take a catch. Waugh was running from the infield towards the outfield, while Gillespie was running in. Waugh dived for the ball resulting in his nose and Gillespie&#x27;s right leg being broken. The catch was not taken. Gillespie&#x27;s career was cut short by a shoulder injury while fielding for South Australia, leading to his retirement.

==Coaching career==
Gillespie became a coach in Zimbabwe in August 2010. He worked primarily with the MidWest Rhinos, but also on &quot;grassroots&quot; activities to improve the performance of young players in Zimbabwe.

Gillespie was drafted in as the bowling coach of Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab after their opening match against Pune Warriors in April 2011.

In November 2011, he was named first-team coach of Yorkshire after a shake up in the club&#x27;s coaching system. In his first season with Yorkshire, they were promoted from Division Two of the County Championship; in the second they were runners-up in the first division; and they won the title in 2014 and 2015, when he was one of the candidates to coach England. He returned to Australia after Yorkshire narrowly missed out on a third successive title in 2016.

In April 2015, Gillespie was named as the coach of the Adelaide Strikers team in the Big Bash League.

In July 2017, Gillespie was appointed as the interim head coach for the Papua New Guinea national team replacing former New Zealand Test player, Dipak Patel.

In 2018, Gillespie took up the position of head coach of Sussex.

In August 2020, Gillespie was appointed the new coach of South Australia.

In 2021, Gillespie was named an Australia Post Legend of Cricket.

===Pakistan (2024)===
In April 2024, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced Gillespie as the head coach of the Pakistan men&#x27;s team in the test cricket for a two-year period.
In October 2024, Gillespie was appointed coach of the white ball team on an interim basis following the departure of South Africa&#x27;s Gary Kirsten. He subsequently led a white-ball tour to Australia in Kirsten&#x27;s absence, securing victory in the one-day series but losing the T20 series. Aqib Javed replaced him for the following tour to Zimbabwe.

On 12th December 2024, He resigned as head coach of Pakistan&#x27;s Test side.

<doc id="409562" wikidata="Q627173" url="?curid=409562" title="Worker-communist Party of Iran">
<text>The Worker-communist Party of Iran () is a political party founded in 1991 that seeks the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the establishment of a Socialist Republic in its place. The party&#x27;s primary slogans are &quot;Liberty, Equality, Workers&#x27; Rule&quot;, &quot;Down with the Islamic Republic&quot;, &quot;For a Socialist Republic&quot; and &quot;The Basis of Socialism is the Human Being&quot;.

WPI owns a 24-hour TV station called New Channel, which broadcasts mainly in Persian, but includes some programming in English, Kurdish and Azeri Turkish. The Communist Youth Organization is the youth wing of WPI. The organization&#x27;s current leader is Hamid Taqvaee.

==Status==
WPI is banned in Iran, as are other parties opposed to the Islamic Republic. It nevertheless boasts members in worker, student, women and other sections of Iranian society. The party maintains a presence in Western countries; having official organizations in Germany, the UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, France, Finland, Denmark ,USA, Canada, Turkey and Australia. Using these countries as a base, the WPI works with the Iranian community to further its immediate aims to overthrow the Islamic Republic.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
WPI was formed in 1991 after some members of the Communist Party of Iran left to form a new party. The main founder and leader of the party was Mansoor Hekmat, who died on July 4th, 2002. The founding declaration of the party has four signatures: Mansoor Hekmat, Koorosh Modarresi, Reza Moghadam and Iraj Azarin. The latter three individuals have since left the party.

=== Debate on leadership ===
After the death of Mansoor Hekmat in 2002, there was a debate in the party over whether a new leader should be announced or not. This led to the formation of two factions, one centred on Hamid Taqvaee, who was defending &quot;Collective Leadership&quot;, the other around Koroosh Modaressi who believed that party should choose a leader immediately. The Central Committee subsequently voted for immediate election of a leader. Taqvaee and Modaressi nominated themselves and Koroosh Modaressi was chosen.

During the 4th Congress of Party, Modaressi did not nominate himself for leadership again saying that he would like stand down in favor of Hamid Taqvaee who, as the only candidate, was then appointed automatically.

=== Major split in August 2004 ===
The leadership debates eventually led to the exodus of more than half of the members of Central Committee and most of the Kurdistan Committee in August 2004. The defectors chose the leadership of Koroosh Modaressi, who was then Chairperson of the Political Bureau. This move was supported by the leadership of the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq. Together they formed a new party called the Worker-Communist Party of Iran-Hekmatist. They claim to be closer to the ideas of Mansoor Hekmat, though this is denied by the leadership of the WPI, who declared themselves to be the real followers of Hekmat&#x27;s ideas.

The conflict between the two parties is still ongoing and the WPI leadership sometimes sarcastically refer to the WPI-H as &#x27;anti-Hekmatist&#x27;. In return the WPI-H claim that WPI represents a retreat to the &quot;traditional left&quot; and is a &quot;populist&quot; party.

== Publications and papers ==
The WPI&#x27;s main newspaper is &quot;Anternasional&quot; (in Persian, &quot;International&quot;), an eight-page Persian publication which is published every Friday. However, the party is also responsible for the following publications: https://anternasional.com/wp/
*&quot;Javânân-e Kommunist&quot; (in Persian:Communist Youth), it used to being published every Tuesday (in Persian) this is the official paper of the Communist Youth Organisation;
*&quot;WPI Briefing&quot;, an official publication in English. Similar papers are also published in German and Dutch.
*&quot;Kârgar-e Kommunist&quot; (The Communist Worker), which mainly covers workers&#x27; issues. 
*&quot;Workers in Iran&quot;, an English newsletter concerning the latest news from the workers&#x27; movement in Iran.
*&quot;Iskraa&quot;, a Persian paper published by the WPI Kurdistan Committee.http://iskraa.net

In March 2006 the WPI started a theoretical journal named &quot;Be Su-ye Sosialism&quot; (in Persian: به سوی سوسیالیسم &quot;Toward Socialism&quot;). The first issue was published in October 2008.
In 2022 Keyva Javid started a daily publication named Journal in Farsi.https://journalfarsi.com/

== Participation in allied groups and campaigns ==
Since the establishment of the party, WPI members and cadres have created and joined many organisations and campaigns on different issues. Such organisations are usually very close to the party. These are as follows:

*The Communist Youth Organisation.
*The International Federation of Iranian Refugees, known as &quot;Hambastegi&quot; (solidarity) is a vast organisation that was formed before the establishment of WPI but today is close to party. IFIR is struggling for refugees&#x27; rights, especially those who come from Iran. IFIR has a weekly paper in Persian named &quot;Hambastegi Haftegi&quot; (Weekly Solidarity) and a monthly paper (also in Persian) named &quot;Hambastegi Mahane&quot; (Monthly Solidarity).
*Children First Now emerged from Children First (which was formed by Mansoor Hekmat and Soraya Shahabi) and is a campaign for children&#x27;s rights in Iran. It publishes a Persian paper called &quot;Koodakan Moqadamand&quot; (Children are Precedent).
*The Marx Society of London was formed By Mansoor Hekmat and Koroosh Modarresi after a long series of debates following the major split in the WPI in August 2004. It is working closely with WPI. The Society concentrates on theoretical issues in Marxism. Other Marx Societies (also close to WPI) have been formed in other countries, such as Canada.
*Anjomane Zede din (Anti-Religion Society) is a secularist group formed in August 2005. it is very close to WPI and has its own paper, called in Persian, &quot;Sekolar&quot;.

== Sister parties ==
The Leftist Worker-Communist Party of Iraq (LWPI) which was formed in 2004 after the major split in the WPI. It is a sister party to WPI. The LWPI&#x27;s Current Leader, Osam Shukri, is a member of Central Committee and politburo of WPI.
