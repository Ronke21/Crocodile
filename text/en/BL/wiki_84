<text>Gidon Kremer (; born 27 February 1947) is a Latvian classical violinist, artistic director, and founder of Kremerata Baltica.

==Life and career==
Gidon Kremer was born in Riga. His father was Jewish and had survived the Holocaust. His mother had German-Swedish origins. His grandfather was a well-known musicologist and violinist in Riga. The boy began playing the violin at the age of four, receiving instruction from his father and his grandfather, who were both professional violinists. He went on to study at the Riga School of Music, where his teacher was mainly Voldemar Sturestep (Voldemārs Stūresteps). From 1965, Kremer studied with David Oistrakh at the Moscow Conservatory. In 1967, he won third prize at the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels. In 1969, he won second prize at the Montreal International Violin Competition (shared with Oleh Krysa), followed by first prize at the Paganini Competition in Genoa, and finally first prize again in 1970 at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.

Kremer&#x27;s first concert in the West was in Vienna&#x27;s Musikverein in 1970, where he played with Thomas Schippers and the Vienna Philharmonic. He debuted in Germany at the festival Bachwoche Ansbach and in the Berlin Philharmonie in 1975 and in London under André Previn in 1976, followed by appearances at the Salzburg Festival in 1976 and in New York City and in Japan in 1977. In 1980, he left the USSR and settled in Germany. In 1981, Kremer founded a chamber music festival in Lockenhaus, Austria, with a focus on new and unconventional programming, serving as artistic director for 30 years until 2011. In 1997, Kremer founded the Kremerata Baltica chamber orchestra, composed of young players from the Baltic region. He was also among the artistic directors of the festival &quot;Art Projekt 92&quot; in Munich and is director of the &quot;Musiksommer&quot; Gstaad festival (1996/97) and Basel (&quot;les musiques&quot;) in Switzerland. In 2007–2008, he and Kremerata Baltica toured with the classical musical comedy duo Igudesman &amp; Joo. He also made regular appearances at the Verbier Festival until the summer of 2011, when he publicly criticised the perceived &#x27;star culture&#x27; aspect of the festival and withdrew from the festival.

He has performed works by Astor Piazzolla (in the Hommage à Piazzolla recordings), George Enescu, Alban Berg, Dmitri Shostakovich, Béla Bartók, Philip Glass, Alfred Schnittke, Victor Kissine, Mieczysław Weinberg, Arthur Lourié and John Adams. He also performed works by Leonid Desyatnikov, Alexander Raskatov, Alexander Vustin, Lera Auerbach, Pēteris Vasks, Arvo Pärt, Victoria Poleva, Valentyn Sylvestrov, Stevan Kovacs Tickmayer. Among the many composers who have dedicated works to him are Sofia Gubaidulina (&quot;Offertorium&quot;) and Luigi Nono (&quot;La lontananza nostalgica utopica futura&quot;), Alfred Schnittke, Giya Kancheli, Victor Kissine.

His partners in performance include Valery Afanassiev, Martha Argerich, Mikhail Pletnev, Oleg Maisenberg, Vadim Sakharov, Mischa Maisky, Yo-Yo Ma, Clemens Hagen, Giedrė Dirvanauskaitė, Yuri Bashmet, Kim Kashkashian, Thomas Zehetmair, Tatiana Grindenko and Per Arne Glorvigen.
He has a large discography on the Deutsche Grammophon label, for which he has recorded since 1978. He has also recorded for Philips Records, EMI, Decca Records, ECM and Nonesuch Records. Celebrating the 70th birthday (27 February 2017) of Gidon Kremer, on 14 October 2016 Deutsche Grammophon released an original jackets box set &quot;GIDON KREMER Complete Concerto Recordings on Deutsche Grammophon&quot;. ECM Records marked the occasion with a new album of all Mieczysław Weinberg&#x27;s chamber symphonies, released in January 2017, recorded together with Kremerata Baltica.

In other media, Kremer played the role of Paganini in Peter Schamoni&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Frühlingssinfonie&quot; (&quot;Spring Symphony&quot;) and was the music director of the film &quot;Le joueur de violon&quot; by Charles Van Damme.

Kremer is the author of four books on music, including &quot;Fragments of Childhood&quot; (&quot;Kindheitsplitter&quot;) and &quot;Letters to a Young Pianist&quot; (2013).

<doc id="408472" wikidata="Q870196" url="?curid=408472" title="Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790)">
<text>The Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790 was fought between Sweden and Russia from June 1788 to August 1790. The war was ended by the Treaty of Värälä on 14 August 1790 and took place concomitantly with both the Austro-Turkish War (1788–1791), Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) and Theatre War. The war was, overall, mostly insignificant for the parties involved.

King Gustav III of Sweden initiated the war for domestic political reasons, hoping to gain support from the opposition. Despite forming an alliance with the Ottoman Empire, Sweden failed to secure support from Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, and Prussia. Sweden&#x27;s initial plan to attack Saint Petersburg and instigate a coup to depose Empress Catherine II did not materialize. The war led to Denmark–Norway declaring war on Sweden, but peace was eventually signed on 9 July 1789 after diplomatic intervention by Great Britain and Prussia.

During the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790, Sweden attempted to prevent Russian ships from cutting off coastal sea routes by building fortifications at Hangö and on its surrounding islands. Both Swedish and Russian navies engaged in multiple indecisive battles throughout the conflict, such as the Battle of Öland and the First and Second Battle of Svensksund. The last-mentioned naval battle was the biggest success of the Swedes in this war, whereas the highest Russian success at sea was the Battle of Reval. The war on land was marked by numerous skirmishes and shifting front lines but ultimately remained a stalemate. King Gustav III of Sweden, realizing the difficulty of defeating Russia and facing mounting war expenses, sought peace. Empress Catherine II of Russia, distracted by other conflicts and concerns, also desired peace. Overall, the war did not provide any lasting solutions to their respective domestic issues.

==Background==
The conflict was initiated by King Gustav III of Sweden for domestic political reasons, as he believed that a short war would leave the opposition with no recourse but to support him. Despite establishing himself as an autocrat in a bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that ended parliamentary rule in 1772, his political powers did not give him the right to start a war. He was also becoming increasingly unpopular, an issue which became obvious during the parliament session of 1786. This unpopularity was also encouraged by Russia, which believed an autocratic king to be a threat to its interests. However, Russian support for his opposition did not go unnoticed by Gustav III, and was one of the reasons why he thought of the war as inevitable. The Western powers — such as Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Prussia — were alarmed by a string of Russian victories in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) and lobbied for the war in the north, which would have diverted the attention of Catherine II of Russia from the Southern theatre. It was at their instigation that Gustav concluded an alliance with the Ottoman Empire in the summer of 1788. However, only the Ottoman Empire was willing to ally with Sweden while Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, and Prussia rejected efforts to form an alliance.

Before the grand opening of the Riksdag in 1789, King Gustav III had the Riksdag Music commissioned. The Parliament then decided on the creation of a National Debt Office to raise funds and finance the war, a move that gave rise to a wave of inflation of the Swedish riksdaler.

==Preparations for the war==
The Swedes initially planned a naval assault on Saint Petersburg. One Swedish army was to advance through Finland; a second army, accompanied by the Swedish coastal flotilla, was to advance along the Finnish coast into the Gulf of Finland; while a third army sailed with the Swedish battlefleet in order to land at Oranienbaum to advance on Saint Petersburg. The goal was to instigate a &quot;coup de état&quot; in Russia and depose Empress Catherine II. Sveaborg was set as the forward base of operations for the campaign. However, the whole concept was based on the assumption that the Swedish open sea fleet would be able to decisively defeat its Russian counterpart. Incidentally, Russian forces were not totally unprepared for the war since the bulk of the Russian Baltic Fleet was planned to be transferred against the Ottoman Empire and had made preparations of its own for war.

War was far from popular, even less so in the eastern part of Sweden (Finland). Even senior military leaders voiced their opposition to the plans to go to war. Especially amongst the officers of the army, unrest spread widely. This could partly be explained by the still remaining supporters of Georg Magnus Sprengtporten&#x27;s plans for Finnish independence.

In 1788, a head tailor of the Royal Swedish Opera received an order to sew a number of Russian military uniforms that later were used in an exchange of gunfire at Puumala, a Swedish outpost on the Russo-Swedish border, on 27 June 1788. The staged attack, which caused outrage in Stockholm, was to convince the Riksdag of the Estates and to provide Gustav with an excuse to declare a &quot;defensive war&quot; on Russia. This was important since Gustav III did not have the constitutional right to start an offensive war without the agreement of the estates, who had already made clear that their acceptance would not be forthcoming.

==The war==

===1788===
The Swedish open sea fleet sailed from Karlskrona on 9 June 1788, with Duke Charles of Södermanland as its commander. On 21 June the fleet met a Russian squadron off Saaremaa island and after chasing the Russians down tried to provoke a conflict by demanding Russians render honours to the Swedes from which Russians had been exempted in the previous peace treaties. Vice Admiral Wilhelm von Dessin who commanded the small Russian squadron agreed to render honours to Duke Charles but not to the Swedish flag and managed to dissolve the threatening situation and continue towards Copenhagen. Since the Swedish wanted to avoid initiating the conflict they had lost their chance to provoke the Russians into war and were left empty-handed.

On 7 July the Swedish fleet was notified that a state of war with Russia was in effect, and already on 8 July surprised two unprepared Russian frigates – 32-gun &quot;Jaroslavets&quot; (&quot;Jarislawits&quot;) and 24-gun &quot;Hektor&quot; (&quot;Gektor&quot;) – which were promptly captured together with their crew of 450 men. The Swedish fleet met a Russian fleet sailing under the command of Admiral Samuel Greig and fought an engagement, the Battle of Hogland, in which neither side managed to gain advantage. Upon return to Sveaborg to repair and resupply Duke Charles&#x27; fleet, the Swedes found that Sveaborg had been stocked only with coastal fleet in mind, which amongst other things meant that it did not store ammunition for the heavy cannons of the open sea fleet and lacked suitable stocks of equipment required to repair large sailing ships.

The coastal fleet&#x27;s Stockholm&#x27;s squadron departed for Finland on 25 June, carrying over 9,000 troops. It reached its destination of Sveaborg on 2 July and started constructing an encampment on the island of Sandhamn, next to Helsingfors. The coastal fleet&#x27;s Sveaborg squadron under Colonel Michael Anckarsvärd had been readied for action already by mid-June. On 26 July, the coastal fleet under Colonel Anckarsvärd departed for Frederikshamn, carrying 6,000 men, while a 4,000-strong unit advanced on land under General Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. The Swedish coastal fleet clashed briefly with a group of Russian galleys outside Frederikshamn on 28 July, and forced them to retire within the protection of the fortifications. Initial Swedish landing attempts began on 2 August but bad weather prevented the main force from landing and a Russian counterattack forced the 300-man Swedish landing party to return to their ships. On 3 August, landings were successful, some 10 km south-east of the town, and by the evening Swedish forces were advancing towards Frederikshamn. However, inspired Russian resistance in the early hours of 4 August convinced the Swedish landing force to return to its ships. Attempts to swiftly capture Frederikshamn ended in total failure for several reasons, one of the most glaring being the increasing unrest against the king amongst the officers.

Attempts by Colonel &#x27;s 1,700-man-strong to storm Nyslott by surprise on 2 July ended in a siege which, given the besiegers&#x27; total lack of siege artillery, caused the Swedish advance to bog down. The siege had to be abandoned on 21 August. General &#x27;s 4,000 men were to support the coastal fleet&#x27;s capture of Frederikshamn and crossed the border on 18 July, reaching its staging ground just north of Frederikshamn on 20 July. A further 1,100 men were under the command of Colonel Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. When the failure at Frederikshamn became apparent, the Swedish troops were pulled back to the border. The war being perceived illegal as it did not have the support of the estates, along with its lack of success, contributed to rising unrest. Already on 9 August, a group of officers had pleaded for peace with Russia, and on 12 August had signed what became known as the Anjala declaration, with the whole matter being later known as the Anjala conspiracy. King Gustav III&#x27;s position, surrounded by rebellious officers, was greatly improved when news of a threat of war from Denmark–Norway became known and he could head back to Sweden on 25 August without being accused of deserting his troops.

The Swedish attack on Russia caused Denmark–Norway to declare war on Sweden in August, in accordance with its treaty obligations to Russia. A Norwegian army briefly invaded Sweden and won the Battle of Kvistrum Bridge, before peace was signed on 9 July 1789, following the diplomatic intervention of Great Britain and Prussia. Under their pressure, Denmark–Norway declared itself neutral in the conflict, bringing the Theatre War to an end.
The Russian fleet had already in early August, soon after the Battle of Hogland, moved to blockade the Swedish open sea fleet in Sveaborg, as the Swedes were unable to get their fleet ready for battle. A small detachment, under command of James Travene, from the Russian fleet cut the safe coastal sea route past Hangö in late August 1788. This caused severe supply troubles for the Swedish fleets and armies, which were mostly east of the cape. A small coastal fleet detachment under Lieutenant-Colonel sortied to drive off the Russians, but lacked the strength to do so. After receiving reinforcements, the Swedes managed on 17 October to engage large Russian units for long enough for the small gunboats to slip past the blockade and protect the transports west of the cape, which probably saved the transports containing army and fleet supplies from capture. A few days later, the Russians abandoned their position, allowing Swedish transports to deliver supplies unhindered. Since Sveaborg could not repair and refit the ships of the open sea fleet, it had to set sail for Karlskrona. However, preparations and unsuitable weather delayed departure until 20 November, when the sea at Sveaborg was already frozen over and some ships had to be freed by sawing the ice open for them. The fleet, however, reached Karlskrona one week later without any losses, just days before that port also froze over.

===1789===

In an attempt to prevent Russian ships from cutting off coastal sea routes, the Swedes built several fortifications at Hangö and on its surrounding islands during the winter of 1788/1789. Additional fortifications were constructed west of Hangö, near Korpo. However, Porkala cape was left without fortifications. The bulk of the Swedish army in Finland, consisting of 13,000 men under General Johan August Meijerfeldt the Younger, was placed at the Kymmene river, with a further 5,000 men in Savolax. While the troops still lacked supplies, their discipline and morale had been greatly improved from what it had been in 1788. On the naval front, Sweden had not been so lucky; the crews of the open sea fleet based at Karlskrona suffered heavily from fever, making both fitting and manning the ships very difficult, and it took until 6 July before the fleet was able to set sail, under command of Duke Charles of Södermanland, who had the experienced naval officer Admiral as his flag-captain.


In stark contrast to Swedish troubles, the Russian open sea fleet had set sail already in mid-May; by 22 May a few ships reconnoitered the Swedish defences at Hangö, but after a short engagement the Russian ships chose to break off. The main body of the Russian fleet under Admiral Vasily Chichagov met the Swedish fleet on 26 July, and engaged it in what became known as the Battle of Öland. As in the previous year, the battle was indecisive, with the Swedes heading to Karlskrona and the Russian fleet joining up with a Russian squadron from Danish waters. The raging epidemic then confined the Swedish fleet to Karlskrona for most of the year.

The Swedish coastal fleet had been unable to sail for Sweden for the winter and had to be fitted out in Finland. In addition to the problems, the commander of the coastal fleet Colonel Anckarsvärd was arrested for being involved with the Anjala conspiracy and replaced with Admiral Carl August Ehrensvärd. The Swedish coastal fleet was able to sail from Sveaborg in late May and moved to the vicinity of Frederikshamn. However, after Hangö had been fortified, the Russians had moved in to blockade the coastal sea route at Porkala on 10 June. This effectively split the Swedish coastal fleet, as reinforcements from Sweden were unable to join with the main body, putting the coastal fleet at a severe disadvantage against the Russian coastal fleet.

In mid-June 1789, the Russians attacked Savolax from three different directions, with total forces of roughly 10,000 men against 4,000 Swedish defenders. Despite a clear victory at the Battle of Porrassalmi, the Swedish army was forced to withdraw, leaving the important Puumala straits to the Russians. Meanwhile, King Gustav III had assumed control of the main body of the Swedish army and started an offensive towards Villmanstrand on 25 June. The Swedes won a resounding victory at Utti on 28 June, but instead of advancing to Villmanstrand, the king headed for Frederikshamn. Once again, however, the Swedish offensive was bogged down. It took until 18 July for Russian defences outside Frederikshamn to be cleared, and during this time the Russian army had kept moving its forces south from Savolax. Small detachments (roughly 2,000 men) sent to stop the Russians were defeated at Kaipiainen and the Swedish army had to withdraw to the border once again. The Russian departure from Savolax enabled Swedish units in the area under the command of Colonel Curt von Stedingk to go onto the offensive. His forces advanced towards Nyslott and won several engagements against the Russians, first at Parkuinmäki Hill and later at Laitaatsilta. When forces moved to their winter encampments, very little had changed from the spring, with the Savolax Brigade having recaptured lost land, and only Puumala had remaining in Russian control.

The Russian coastal fleet under Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen started attacking the Swedish coastal fleet on 15 August, by driving away the Swedish squadron which was scouting the area near Frederikshamn. This was followed by an attack against the main staging ground of the Swedish coastal fleet at Svensksund, leading to the first Battle of Svensksund. The Russians tried to take advantage of their victory over the Swedes with a co-ordinated offensive of both the coastal fleet and the army, which managed to drive the remaining Swedes beyond the Kymmene river. The battered Swedish coastal fleet was soon reinforced with ships from Sveaborg, while its commander Admiral Carl August Ehrensvärd was replaced, first by Colonel , who oversaw the repairs, and later by Lieutenant-Colonel .

The Russian blockade caused considerable trouble to the Swedes. Starting already in early July, Swedish gunboats engaged the much larger Russians on a daily basis, under the command of Admiral Salomon von Rajalin, who was in overall command of the Swedish coastal fleet in the Porkala region. Since von Rajalin&#x27;s forces lacked the strength to overpower the Russian blockade, they instead covered the Swedish transports in their passage through the Barösund strait. The Swedish forces were repeatedly reinforced during the summer and already in mid-July consisted of 2 frigates, 10 galleys and several gunboats. Several artillery batteries were constructed to protect the area. Fighting at sea near Porkala cape continued until September. The Russian blockade at Porkala was after 24 August 1789 under the command of Captain James Trevenen, who started the effort to break the Swedish hold on Barösund. The Russian attack against Barösund started on 18 September. The attacking force consisted of 4 ships of the line, 1 frigate and 6 cutters. Fighting continued for two hours and cost the Swedes a single galley and the Russians one ship of the line (&quot;Severny Oryol&quot;) and several others damaged, but it gained the Russians the control of the Barösund strait. Sporadic fighting in the archipelago near Porkala continued and on 23 September the Russians captured the island of Älgsjön from the Swedes, but lost it on 30 September when Swedish reinforcements under Colonel Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt arrived. The Russian fleet left the area suddenly on 23 October, possibly due to the news that the Swedish open sea fleet had set sail, which it had done on 13 October, only to return to Karlskrona on 22 October. The Russian departure opened the safe coastal sea route to Swedish transports.

===1790===

In 1790, King Gustav III revived the plan for a landing close to Saint Petersburg, this time near Vyborg. In addition, a determined effort was made to bolster the strength of the fleets as much as possible so as to be able to get them under sail as soon as possible. The coastal fleet especially was being reinforced with new and stronger ships, some of them donated by the various Swedish towns. The first action took place on 17 March 1790, when two Swedish frigates plundered the Russian-controlled port of Rågersvik (Baltiyskiy Port). Swedish squadrons from Stockholm started towards Sveaborg on 21 April and also from Pommern on 3 May. Even though the Swedish main effort was on the sea, they attacked also on land, where Swedes led by Colonel Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt defeated Russian defenders on 15 April in southern Savolax, while the army led by King Gustav III and Colonel Gustaf Wachtmeister won another victory in the Battle of Valkeala. A Russian attack on 5 May close to the Kymmene river gained some success, capturing Anjala, but was thrown back before the end of the month. Fighting on land, however, reached stalemate, and already in June had turned into static warfare.

The Swedish open sea fleet under Duke Charles arrived on 10 May at Hangö and moved on 12 May to the vicinity of Reval. As some ships of the fleet were still separated from the main body, Duke Charles refused to carry out the attack on 12 May, when favourable winds still existed, and instead chose to attack on 13 May, leading to the Swedish failure at the Battle of Reval. The Swedish fleet stayed near Reval until late May, when it set sail to protect the flank of the coastal fleet; this led to another naval engagement, at the Battle of Kronstadt. Failing to inflict a decisive defeat on the Russians, or to prevent separate Russian squadrons from joining, the open sea fleet sailed to Vyborg Bay.

The coastal fleet started its offensive on 8 May, under command of King Gustav III with de Frese as his flag-captain, without waiting for the coastal fleet&#x27;s squadrons from Sweden or Pommern. The Swedish coastal fleet attacked the Russian fleet at Frederikshamn on 15 May, winning a clear victory over the defenders in the Battle of Fredrikshamn. However, attempts to capture the town and its fortifications failed. Instead of blockading the town, the Swedes chose to continue further towards Vyborg while raiding Russian supplies along the coast, and reached the Beryozovye Islands on 2 June, from where it attempted to support the open sea fleet in the Battle of Kronstadt.
The Russian fleet, under command of Admiral Vasily Chichagov, blockaded the Swedish fleets with their 30,000 men in Vyborg Bay. The blockade continued for a month and on 21–23 June, with supplies running out, the Swedes chose to attempt a breakout as soon as favorable winds would allow it. The Swedish coastal squadron under Lieutenant-Colonel Carl Olof Cronstedt arrived at Svensksund on 19 June and supported the ground forces of General Meijerfeldt in driving away Russian forces from its vicinity. However, Cronstedt&#x27;s squadron could not get past a Russian frigate detachment under Captain Rowan Crown (orig. Robert Cronin) blocking the coastal sea route near modern-day Virolahti and had to return to Svensksund. The Swedish escape from Vyborg Bay started on 3 July and lost several ships when they ran aground due to bad visibility in the treacherous waters. The Swedish battle fleet retired to Sveaborg for repairs while the Swedish coastal fleet made for a strong defensive position at Svensksund. The Russian coastal fleet, led by Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen started its attack against the Swedes on 9 July 1790, in what became known as the second Battle of Svensksund, which ended in a decisive Swedish victory.

Despite recent success, King Gustav III believed that his chances of successfully continuing the war were low. His government was also rapidly suffering from ever-increasing debt caused by the war expenses. On the other hand, Empress Catherine II became convinced that the Swedes would not be easily defeated and was anxious for peace in a war which was not important for her. The Russian Vice-Chancellor Alexander Bezborodko immediately agreed to negotiations, and the war was ended by the Treaty of Värälä on 14 August.

==Aftermath==

The Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790 was, overall, mostly insignificant for the parties involved. Catherine II regarded the war against her Swedish cousin as a substantial distraction, as her land troops were tied up in the war against Turkey, and she was likewise concerned with revolutionary events unfolding in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (the Constitution of 3 May 1791) and in France (the French Revolution). The Swedish attack foiled the Russian plans of sending its navy into the Mediterranean Sea to support its forces fighting the Ottomans, as it was needed to protect the capital, Saint Petersburg. The war solved Gustav III&#x27;s domestic problems only briefly, as he was assassinated at the opera in Stockholm, in 1792.

<text>The Chain Gang is a 1930 Mickey Mouse animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions for Columbia Pictures, as part of the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; film series. It was the twenty-first Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the sixth of that year. It is one of a group of shorts of strikingly uneven quality produced by Disney immediately after Ub Iwerks left the studio.

The cartoon was primarily drawn by Norm Ferguson, and featured a pair of bloodhounds, who helped to track down Mickey after his prison escape. Although these dogs were not named, the style in which they were drawn makes them clear forerunners of Pluto, who first officially appeared a few months later in &quot;The Picnic&quot;. The animation for one of the bloodhound scenes in &quot;The Chain Gang&quot; was recycled as Pluto in four later cartoons. Additionally, a few scenes contain reused animation from the Oswald The Lucky Rabbit cartoon &quot;Sagebrush Sadie&quot;.

Due to being published in 1930, the cartoon will enter the public domain on January 1, 2026.

== Plot ==
Mickey Mouse is in prison, connected with a chain to six other prisoners as they are led out to the yard for hard labor. He keeps a cheery grin, banging on the iron ball and singing, until the prison guard, Peg-Leg Pete, tells him to shut up. The prisoners break rocks, but when the guard falls asleep at his post, Mickey plays Vernon Dalhart&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner&#x27;s Song&quot; on his harmonica. The other prisoners join in with the song, singing and using their implements as instruments.

One of the inmates dances to the tune of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Spring Song&quot;, but when he spits on the guard, Pete wakes up and whistles for help. This starts a prison riot, and the guards shoot at the prisoners. Mickey uses a seesaw to fly over the prison wall, and escapes into the nearby woods.

Mickey is chased into a swamp by a guard accompanied by two bloodhounds, and tries to get away by riding a pair of horses. With the horses out of control, Mickey flies off a cliff, which happens to be right above the prison. He falls through the roof into a cell, where two inmates happily sing &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot;. Mickey joins in for the final iris out.

== Legacy ==
In a scene animated by Norm Ferguson, Mickey is chased by two bloodhounds after his prison break, and we see each hound approach and sniff, then bark directly into the camera. According to Gijs Grob in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Movies&quot;: &quot;These hounds are possibly the most elaborately designed and most naturally behaving animals in any theatrical cartoon hitherto, and would become the prototype of Pluto&quot;. In 1932, Disney&#x27;s in-house art instructor Don Graham said: &quot;The dogs were alive, real. They seemed to breathe. They moved like dogs, not drawings of dogs. The drawings explained not so much what a real dog looked like, but what a real dog did&quot;.

== Voice cast ==
* Bloodhounds: Lee Millar

== Reception ==
&quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;One of the most amusing cartoons released. Has to do with animal prison. &#x27;Volga Boatman&#x27; and &#x27;Prison Song&#x27; theming. Usual method of using each other&#x27;s tails or hoofs for instruments. A jailbreak is used effectively&quot;.

== Home media ==
The short was released on December 2, 2002, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black and White&quot; and on December 7, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Pluto: 1930–1947&quot;.

<doc id="408475" wikidata="Q250036" url="?curid=408475" title="Justice League (TV series)">
<text>Justice League is an American animated television series which ran from November 17, 2001, to May 29, 2004, on Cartoon Network. The show was produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It is based on the Justice League of America and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics. It serves as a sequel to &quot;&quot; (including &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;) and &quot;&quot;, as well as a prequel to &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, and is the seventh series of the DC Animated Universe. The series ended after two seasons, but was followed by &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, a successor series which aired for three seasons.

== Overview ==
Bruce Timm, who co-produced &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in the 1990s, became producer on an animated series focusing on the Justice League. The roster consisted of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), The Flash (Wally West), Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl.

According to audio commentary on the DVD release of Season 2, the second-season finale &quot;Starcrossed&quot; was expected to be the final episode of the series. However, in February 2004, Cartoon Network announced a follow-up series, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, which premiered on July 31, 2004, and featured a larger roster of characters.

It is the first series in the DC Animated Universe to fully use digital ink and paint, also the first to be produced in widescreen starting in Season 2.

===Production===
Kevin Conroy reprised his voice role as Batman from &quot;&quot; (1992–1995), &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997–1999), and &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001). Batman&#x27;s costume was redesigned, but this time, his costume was a combination of his last three costumes. The same costume from &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; is retained, but with the blue highlights from the &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; costume and the long-ears from the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; costume are added to the costume. Tim Daly, who voiced Superman in &quot;&quot; (1996–2000), was initially involved, but was unable to continue his role due to involvement with &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. He was replaced by George Newbern. Both Newbern and Daly have voiced the character in different DC projects outside the DCAU, with Newbern becoming the longest-running actor to portray Superman.

Alongside Kevin Conroy and George Newbern as Superman, joining the rest of the main cast is Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Maria Canals-Barrera as Hawkgirl, Phil LaMarr as John Stewart, Michael Rosenbaum as the Flash, and Carl Lumbly as Martian Manhunter.

Several actors in previous DCAU media also reprise their roles, including Dana Delany as Lois Lane, David Kaufman as Jimmy Olsen, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred Pennyworth, Shelley Fabares and Mike Farrell as Jonathan and Martha Kent, Mark Hamill as the Joker, Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor, Corey Burton as Brainiac, Ron Perlman as Clayface, Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn, Peri Gilpin as Volcana, Diane Pershing as Poison Ivy, Mark Rolston as Firefly, Ted Levine as Sinestro, Brian George as Parasite, Michael Ironside as Darkseid, Michael Dorn as Kalibak, Lisa Edelstein as Mercy Graves, and Brad Garrett as Lobo. In the episode &quot;Hereafter&quot;, Maria Canals-Barrera voiced Livewire and Corey Burton voiced Toyman and Metallo, replacing their respective original actors Lori Petty, Bud Cort, and Malcolm McDowell.

==Home media==
From 2006 to 2011, Warner Home Video (via DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released the entire series of &quot;Justice League&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray, and presented in original broadcast version and story arc continuity order.

Season releases

Warner Home Video also released another DVD set titled &quot;Justice League: The Complete Series.&quot; It contained all 91 episodes of &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; on a 15-disc set with the 15th disc containing a bonus documentary. This was later re-packaged and sold as a 10-disc set without the bonus documentary.

;Individual releases
;Boxsets 
==Soundtrack==
A 4-disc soundtrack of musical highlights from both seasons of Justice League was released by La-La Land Records in July 2016. It is a limited edition of 3000 units and can be ordered at the La-La Land Records website. The set includes tracks from fan-favorite episodes like A Better World, Hereafter, Wild Cards and Starcrossed.

La-La Land are hoping to release a soundtrack for &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; as well, provided that sales of the Justice League soundtrack improve significantly and that there is sufficient demand from fans. A second Justice League volume may also follow if fans support the existing release.

==Broadcast history==

The series premiere on November 17, 2001, set a Cartoon Network record with over 4.114 million viewers. This made it the channel&#x27;s highest rated premiere ever, a record it would keep until September 13, 2009, when the world premiere of &quot;Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins&quot; gathered over 6.108 million viewers.

The show was aired in the Republic of Ireland on TG4 in both Irish and English from 6 September 2002 to 2007.

== Reception==
&quot;Justice League&quot; Season 1 received acclaim for its portrayal of the superhero team and its engaging storytelling. &quot;WhatCulture&quot; praised the season for its exceptional execution, and highlighted the series&#x27; mature handling of themes such as relationships, trauma, and loss, which contributed to its broad appeal across different age groups. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; highlighted the show’s effective team dynamics, drawing a favorable comparison to &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; for its exploration of character relationships. &quot;The Young Folks&quot; admired the show’s versatility, noting its ability to seamlessly shift between emotional, humorous, and epic moments. &quot;io9.com&quot; also appreciated the charm of the heroes’ initial team-up, benefiting from their backgrounds in previous animated series.

Despite its strengths, the season faced some criticism. &quot;CBR&quot; noted that the storytelling in Season 1 often felt superficial, with deeper narratives and character development emerging in later seasons. Filip Vukcevic of IGN agreed, pointing out uneven character development as a drawback but still finding the show entertaining overall. Oliver Sava of &quot;the AV Club&quot; countered this view by praising the expansive nature of the series and its multi-part episodes, which he felt contributed to a strong iteration of the Justice League. Indiewire ranked the show overall as the 20th best animated show of all time. 

The second season of &quot;Justice League&quot; however, is considered to be one of the best seasons of the entire DC Animated Universe, with Oliver Sava from The A.V. Club writing &quot;good enough isn&#x27;t good enough.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s the philosophy for &quot;Justice League&quot; season two, according to producer Bruce Timm on the DVD commentary, and this two-part season opener is the perfect example of that new attitude in action. Just as &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; set a new standard for solo superhero cartoon excellence, Justice League season two is only eclipsed by &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; as the strongest superhero-team series. Everything is of higher quality this season: the direction, animation, music, sound effects, and most importantly, the stories.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
== Cancelled film ==
Circa 2004, Bruce Timm announced that a direct-to-video &quot;Justice League&quot; feature film was being produced to bridge the second season of &quot;Justice League&quot; and the first season of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. It was planned to reveal how Wonder Woman acquired her Invisible Plane and feature the Crime Syndicate as the main antagonists, an idea that was originally conceived for the episode &quot;A Better World&quot; until the Syndicate was replaced by the Justice Lords. Dwayne McDuffie wrote the script and Andrea Romano assembled the cast, but Warner Bros. finally scrapped the project. In 2010, the film was repurposed and released as &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot;, a standalone film unconnected to the DCAU.

==Adaptations==
===&quot;Justice League Adventures&quot;===
DC Comics published a series of 34-issue numbered comics based on the television series, between 2002 and 2004. However, while the comic would use the style of the animated show, it would often ignore its continuity and use backstories and personalities for characters based on the mainstream DC comics instead. 
* #34 (2004-08-04): Guardians Against Darkness!

====Compilations====
* &quot;Justice League Adventures: The Magnificent Seven&quot; (2004-01-01): Includes #3, 6, 10–12.

<text>The Justice League is a team of comic book superheroes in the . Over the years they have featured many characters in a variety of combinations.

The JLA members are listed here in order of their first joining the team, and none are listed twice. No retconned members are listed (except where they historically took part in the stories). No associates and unofficial members, or members of the Super Friends (except when they are also Justice League members in the mainstream comics) are listed.

Non-full members and staff are also listed below.

Characters in bold are current Justice League active members.

==Pre-New 52/Rebirth==
DC Comics had the first fictional universe of superheroes, with the Justice Society of America forming in the Golden Age of Comic Books in the 1940s. This shared continuity became increasingly complex with multiple worlds, including a similar team of all-star superheroes formed in the 1960s named the Justice League of America, debuting in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; Volume 1 #28. This universe included several reboots and retcons starting with &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; in 1986 and culminating in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline, leading to the New 52 in 2011.

<text>Amy Louise Sedaris (; born March 29, 1961) is an American actress, comedian, and writer. She played Jerri Blank in the Comedy Central comedy series &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; (1999–2000) and the prequel film &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; (2005), which she also wrote.

Sedaris appeared as Hurshe Heartshe in the Adult Swim comedy series &quot;The Heart, She Holler&quot; (2013–2014), as Princess Carolyn in the Netflix animated comedy-drama series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; (2014–2020), and as Mimi Kanasis in the Netflix sitcom &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; (2015–2020). She received further critical acclaim as the creator and star of the TruTV surreal comedy series &quot;At Home with Amy Sedaris&quot; (2017–2020) which earned her two nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series. She appeared in both &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–2023) and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2022) as Peli Motto. 

Sedaris has appeared in various films, including &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), &quot;Bewitched&quot; (2005), &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005), &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007), &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; (2009), &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011), &quot;Chef&quot; (2014), &quot;Ghost Team&quot; (2016), &quot;Handsome&quot; (2017), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Boss Baby: Family Business&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Amy Sedaris was born in Endicott, New York, the fourth of six children in a Greek Orthodox family. Her parents were Sharon Elizabeth (née Leonard), a homemaker, and Louis Harry &quot;Lou&quot; Sedaris, an IBM engineer. Her father was born in Cortland, New York to immigrants from Apidea in Greece, and her mother was Anglo-American from Binghamton, New York. Sedaris&#x27; mother was Protestant and her father was Greek Orthodox. Her paternal grandmother did not speak English and owned a shoe shining store in New York. Sedaris&#x27; mother died of lung cancer in 1991, while her father died in 2021.

When she was four, her family moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where she grew up with her five siblings: Lisa, David, Gretchen, Tiffany, and Paul. Her sister Tiffany died by suicide in 2013. She recalled feeling weird in that new environment, as her family was not southern and followed Greek traditions. As a child, Sedaris liked playing dress-up and putting on plays for her family. In her brother David&#x27;s book &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;, he noted that she would often assume characters to play pranks on her family. As a teenager, Sedaris&#x27; first job was at the local Winn-Dixie supermarket where she would make fake announcements over the loudspeaker; for a while, she was determined to work at the local women&#x27;s prison in Raleigh. She attended Jesse O. Sanderson High School and was a Girl Scout until she graduated.

At the age of 20, she and her mother worked together making and selling spanakopita. During that time, she was dating a man from Greece, and one evening after coming home from cooking, she found him unconscious on the kitchen floor. He had a brain aneurysm, and Sedaris spent the next three years caring for him. When they eventually broke up, Sedaris moved to Chicago with her brother David, and took classes at Second City and Annoyance Theatre. There she also worked as a waitress at Zanies Comedy Club.

==Career==

===Television===
In the late 1980s, she was hired to perform with Second City&#x27;s touring company. It was there she met Paul Dinello and Stephen Colbert with whom she often collaborated later in her career. She and Dinello did not get along with Colbert at first, but they became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility. Sedaris left Second City in 1993, and moved to New York City. Sedaris&#x27;s first major foray into television began in 1995 on the Comedy Central sketch series &quot;Exit 57&quot;; alongside Colbert and Dinello. For her performance she was nominated for the 17th CableACE Award for Best Comedy Actress and the series was nominated for Best Comedy Series. It ran for a total of two seasons.

Beginning in 1999 Sedaris played Jerri Blank, a middle-aged woman who goes back to high school in the Comedy Central comedy series &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;. The series, which she co-wrote with Dinello and Colbert was based on Sedaris&#x27;s impression of 1970s-era motivational speaker Florrie Fisher. The show ran for three seasons. In 2005, a film adaptation was released, acting as a prequel to the series.

Sedaris went on to make numerous guest appearances on television programs, including &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (2001), &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2002–2003), &quot;Monk&quot; (2002–2003), &quot;Wonder Showzen&quot; (2005), &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; (2006), &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (2006), &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (2007), &quot;The Closer&quot; (2009), &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot; (2009), &quot;The Middle&quot; (2010), &quot;Raising Hope&quot; (2011–2014), and &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012). She also hosted the series &quot;Film Fanatic&quot; on Trio.

Sedaris&#x27;s talk show appearances include &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, and &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;. During an appearance on &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;, she gave host Chelsea Handler a presentation on vaginal hygiene using a plush vagina created by fashion designer Todd Oldham.

In 2008, Sedaris starred as Principal Abby Hofman in the Nickelodeon television film &quot;Gym Teacher: The Movie&quot;, which was directed by her &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; co-star and frequent collaborator Paul Dinello.

In early 2010, she had a supporting character in the Canadian comedy series &quot;The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour&quot;. Later in 2010 she appeared alongside Paul Dinello in the episode &quot;Mummified Hand&quot;, of the Discovery/Science Channel documentary series &quot;Oddities&quot;.

In 2011, she appeared in a series of commercials for Downy (Lenor UK) Unstoppables, a fabric softener product. Grey Global Group designed the commercials as &quot;kicking the old &#x27;mom&#x27; image with spots featuring &#x27;laundry expert&#x27; (and accomplished lifestyle guru) Amy Sedaris&quot;.

In 2013, she replaced Kristen Schaal as the sex-crazed Hurshe Heartshe, in the second season of the Adult Swim comedy series &quot;The Heart, She Holler&quot;. She also appeared in third and final season. That same year, Sedaris appeared in a major recurring role in the Amazon Prime Video political satire series &quot;Alpha House&quot;, which was written by &quot;Doonesbury&quot; creator Garry Trudeau. Sedaris played Louise Laffer, the Mormon wife of Nevada Senator Louis Laffer who lives with three other Republican senators in a town house on Capitol Hill.

Sedaris later had a recurring role as Pam in the Comedy Central sitcom &quot;Broad City&quot; (2014–2019), as Rita in the Hulu dark comedy series &quot;Difficult People&quot; (2015–2017). From 2015 to 2020, she portrayed Mimi Kanasis in the Netflix comedy series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;, for which she earned a nomination for the Gold Derby Award for Best Comedy Guest Actress.

In 2016, Sedaris appeared in the tragicomedy series &quot;Horace and Pete&quot;, as a character named Mara looking for a job at Horace and Pete&#x27;s. She also co-starred with Chris Elliott in the Sony Crackle family comedy series &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;.

In 2017, Sedaris created the TruTV surreal comedy series &quot;At Home with Amy Sedaris&quot;, which she also wrote and executive produced. The series focused on the comedian&#x27;s love of entertaining, crafts, and cooking. She played numerous characters, including herself, Patty Hogg, Ronnie Vino, and Nutmeg. The series was met with critical acclaim upon its premiere, garnering two consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series, and ran for three seasons.

Sedaris had a starring role as Janice Delongpre, a dispatch officer, in the CBS All Access comedy series &quot;No Activity&quot; from 2017 to 2019. She had guest-starring roles as Cathy in the HBO comedy-drama series &quot;Divorce&quot; (2018).

Sedaris voiced characters in numerous animated series. From 2014 to 2020, she provided the voice for Princess Carolyn in the Netflix adult animated comedy series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, a role which some critics consider her best work.

In 2022, Sedaris voiced Suzanne in Meet Cute&#x27;s holiday rom-com, &quot;Christmasuzannukkah&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved holiday movies. They&#x27;re like comfort food and they never get old,&quot; said Sedaris. &quot;Christmasuzannukkah really brings together the joy, drama and heart of the season, and it was so much fun to be able to do this in a podcast form.&quot;

=== Film ===
Throughout her career, Sedaris had supporting roles in a number of feature films. She appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), the musical comedy &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), the Christmas comedy &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), and the fantasy comedy &quot;Bewitched&quot; (2005).

Her first leading film role came in the 2005 film adaptation &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;, which she also co-wrote. She followed this with supporting roles in the comedy-drama film &quot;Full Grown Men&quot; (2006), the drama film &quot;Snow Angels&quot; (2007), and the ensemble comedy film &quot;Old Dogs&quot; (2009).

In 2003, Sedaris co-authored the text-and-picture novel &quot;Wigfield&quot; alongside collaborators Paul Dinello and Stephen Colbert.

Sedaris has contributed several articles for &quot;The Believer&quot; magazine since 2005. In a 2006 interview with the magazine, she answered part of a Q&amp;A section with, &quot;TURN-OFFS: The beach, having to pay for things, racist people, Orientals.&quot;

In 2006, she released &quot;I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence&quot;, a guide to entertaining, which stayed on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for more than 12 weeks. In 2007, she was working with Dinello on a show for HBO, loosely based on the book, but the project never came to fruition.

In 2010, she released the crafting book &quot;Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People!&quot;. While promoting her book on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in October 2010, she demonstrated how the cover can easily be made into a hat.

The pair&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Liz&quot; (2002) focussed on cheese balls as a metaphor for &quot;the cliches we all live by&quot;, according to Ben Brantley.

She played a role as the Stage Manager in Paul Rudnick&#x27;s play &quot;The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told&quot; (1998) and as Froggy in Douglas Carter Beane&#x27;s play &quot;The Country Club&quot; (1998), the latter of which earned her a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play.

In support of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)&#x27;s anti-fur campaign, Sedaris appeared as her &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; character in an ad that reads, &quot;When you wear fur, people laugh &quot;at&quot; you, not &quot;with&quot; you.&quot;

In 2007, Sedaris was featured in Dolly Parton&#x27;s first mainstream country music video in fourteen years, &quot;Better Get to Livin&#x27;.

She was the emcee for Microsoft&#x27;s 2010 annual employee meeting in Seattle on September 28, 2010.

==Personal life==
Sedaris has run a cupcake and cheeseball business, Dusty Food Cupcakes, out of her home kitchen. Dusty was the name of her pet rabbit. She lives in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City.

Sedaris was in an eight-year relationship with actor/writer Paul Dinello. After their breakup they have remained close friends, with Sedaris being godmother to his two children. Sedaris has said in several interviews that she has never desired to marry or have children.

<text>Jean Stapleton (born Jeanne Murray; January 19, 1923 – May 31, 2013) was an American character actress of stage, television and film. Stapleton is best known for her portrayal of Edith Bunker, the perpetually optimistic and devoted wife of Archie Bunker, on the 1970s sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot;. The role earned her three Emmys and two Golden Globes for Best Actress in a comedy series. 

==Early life==
Stapleton was born on January 19, 1923 in Manhattan. She was the daughter of Marie A. Stapleton, an opera singer, and Joseph E. Murray, a billboard advertising salesman. She had an elder brother, Jack. Her uncle was a vaudevillian performer, and her brother was a stage actor who inspired her to pursue acting.

==Career==
Stapleton began her career in 1942 aged 18 in summer stock theatre and made her New York debut in the Off-Broadway play &quot;American Gothic&quot;. She was featured on Broadway in several hit musicals, such as &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, &quot;Juno&quot;, &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, recreating her parts from the latter two musicals in the film versions of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1958) (her film debut) and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1960).

Stapleton&#x27;s early television roles included parts in &quot;Starlight Theatre&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theater&quot;, &quot;Woman with a Past&quot;, &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, and as Rosa Criley in a 1963 episode of NBC&#x27;s medical drama about psychiatry, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, entitled &quot;The Bride Wore Pink&quot;. In 1962, Stapleton guest-starred as Mrs. Larsen in &quot;The Hidden Jungle&quot;, an episode of the TV series &quot;The Defenders&quot; (broadcast on December 1 that year), alongside her future &quot;All in the Family&quot; co-star Carroll O&#x27;Connor.

Stapleton also appeared in the feature films &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1961), &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; (1967), &quot;Klute&quot; (1971) and the Norman Lear comedy &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (also 1971).

Stapleton bested both Mary Tyler Moore and Marlo Thomas for the &quot;Best Actress in a Comedy&quot; Primetime Emmy award on May 9, 1971. She was offered the role of Mrs. Teevee in the feature film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), but declined because it coincided with the production of the &quot;All in the Family&quot; pilot (the role ultimately went to Nora Denney).

===&quot;All in the Family&quot;===

Stapleton played the role of Edith in &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which premiered in 1971. The show was originally broadcast on the CBS network for nine seasons from January 12, 1971, to April 8, 1979, for a total of 205 episodes. The role earned her three Emmys and two Golden Globes.

Feeling her character had run its course, Stapleton continued the role of Edith for only five more episodes in the follow-up series &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; to help the transition, and then Edith was written out via stroke, offscreen, in the first episode of season two.

===Other works===
Stapleton appeared in the Emmy Award–winning TV movie &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot; (1977), dramatizing the life of U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and later guest-starred in the sixth episode of the third season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (broadcast on September 30, 1978).

In 1979, she featured in the original Canadian production of the musical &quot;Something&#x27;s Afoot&quot;, which was later broadcast on Showtime. She played the title role in the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; TV movie, &quot;Aunt Mary&quot; (also 1979), which detailed the true story of Baltimore children&#x27;s advocate Mary Dobkin. In 1982, Stapleton portrayed Eleanor Roosevelt in the TV movie &quot;Eleanor, First Lady of the World&quot;, focusing on the subject&#x27;s later life. The role earned her Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress.

She continued to guest-star in a number of television series during the 1980s including two episodes of &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; — in 1983 and 1985 editions entitled &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; as the Giant&#x27;s Wife and &quot;Cinderella&quot; as the Fairy Godmother — &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. Stapleton also co-starred in the film &quot;The Buddy System&quot; (1984), alongside Susan Sarandon and Richard Dreyfuss, and played Ariadne Oliver in the 1986 television adaptation of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;, opposite Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. She declined the role of Jessica Fletcher in the TV series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, which went to Angela Lansbury.

From 1990 to 1991, Stapleton co-starred with Whoopi Goldberg in 15 episodes of &quot;Bagdad Cafe&quot;, the television series based on the movie of the same name.

In 1994, Stapleton played the role of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle in a children&#x27;s series of the same name based on the books by Betty MacDonald.

In 1996, Stapleton appeared in the educational series &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot; as Beakman&#x27;s mother, Beakmom, and also appeared on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; playing Ray&#x27;s imperious aunt. The same year, she appeared in the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; episode &quot;All in the Family&quot; playing Miles&#x27;s grandmother, Nana Silverberg, and also played opposite John Travolta in Nora Ephron&#x27;s hit film &quot;Michael&quot; as the eccentric rooming house owner, Pansy Milbank.

Making a debut in the world of video games, Stapleton was the voice of Grandma Ollie on KinderActive, Turner Pictures, and New Line Cinema&#x27;s venture &quot;Grandma Ollie&#x27;s Morphabet Soup&quot;. The game won a Teacher&#x27;s Choice Award from &quot;Learning&quot; Magazine.

On January 26, 1998, Stapleton guest-starred on the Jean Smart sitcom &quot;Style &amp; Substance&quot; in the episode &quot;A Recipe for Disaster&quot;, playing a former television chef who has an alcohol problem. She voiced John Rolfe&#x27;s maid, Mrs. Jenkins, in Disney&#x27;s 1998 direct-to-video animated film &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; as a close co-worker in whom Meg Ryan&#x27;s character confides. From 1998, Stapleton took her &quot;Eleanor&quot; characterization to live theaters, now adapted as a one-woman show.

In May 2000, Stapleton appeared in &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, an episode of the TV series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, portraying an angel named Emma who came to help Celine who was taking care of her late best friend&#x27;s mother.

Stapleton&#x27;s final film role was as Irene Silverman in the 2001 fact-based TV movie, &quot;Like Mother, Like Son: The Strange Story of Sante and Kenny Kimes&quot;, starring Mary Tyler Moore as convicted criminal Sante Kimes. while her final acting role was in Horton Foote&#x27;s The Carpetbaggers Children at Lincoln Center in NY., March 7th 2002.). 

Stapleton was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 2002. She was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame that same year.

==Personal life==
Stapleton was married to William Putch from 1957 until his death in 1983. The couple had two children: actor/writer/director John Putch and television producer Pamela Putch.
For 30 years, William Putch directed a summer stock theater, Totem Pole Playhouse, at Caledonia State Park in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania. Stapleton performed regularly at the theatre with the resident company. When William Putch died of a heart attack during the run of a production Stapleton had been appearing in at the playhouse, Stapleton insisted on performing that night.

Stapleton&#x27;s brother, Jack Stapleton, was a stage actor. Her cousin was actress Betty Jane Watson. Stapleton was active in the Christian Science church. She was unrelated to actress Maureen Stapleton, contrary to a common misconception.

Stapleton supported Walter Mondale&#x27;s campaign in the 1984 presidential election, was a vocal supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, and took an active role in the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference.

Stapleton rarely appeared on talk shows, but reunited on-camera with Carroll O&#x27;Connor on Donny and Marie Osmond&#x27;s show on April 24, 2000, a little over a year before O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death. When the Osmonds asked her to perform in Edith Bunker&#x27;s voice, she declined to do so, and jokingly told them that she only does so &quot;for pay&quot;. 
Stapleton admitted that she seldom watched &quot;All in the Family&quot;, but by 2000 she reconsidered, she told the Archive of American Television.

==Death and reaction==
Stapleton died at her apartment in Manhattan, on May 31, 2013, at age 90.

Norman Lear said, &quot;No one gave more profound &#x27;how to be a human being&#x27; lessons than Jean Stapleton.&quot; Co-star Rob Reiner said, &quot;Working with her was one of the greatest experiences of my life.&quot; Sally Struthers said, &quot;Jean lived so in the present. She was a Christian Scientist who didn&#x27;t say or think a negative thing ... She was just a walking, living angel&quot;.

The marquee lights on Broadway were dimmed for two minutes on June 5, 2013, at 8 p.m. EDT, to honor the memory of Stapleton. She was cremated by Neptune Society in Paramus, New Jersey. Manhattan&#x27;s Andrett Funeral Home directed this service. Her cenotaph lies at Lincoln Cemetery in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.

<text>Ronald Barnabas Schill (born 23 November 1958) is a former German judge, the founder of the German political parties Party for a Rule of Law Offensive (&quot;Partei Rechtsstaatlicher Offensive&quot;; also called PRO or &quot;Schill party&quot;) and &quot;Pro DM/Schill&quot;. He served as the Senator of the Interior and Second Mayor (deputy chief of government) in the government of Hamburg from 2001 to 2003.

He now lives in Brazil. Since 2014, Schill has appeared in inexpensively produced TV reality shows on German cable channels.

==Political career==
Schill started his career as a judge at an Amtsgericht in Hamburg from 1993 to 2001. Due to his controversial rulings as a judge, which frequently involved the maximum penalty, he was given the nickname &quot;Richter Gnadenlos&quot; (&quot;Judge Merciless&quot;); most of these rulings were overruled by higher courts later on.

His new-found right-conservative party managed to gain 19.4% of all votes in the elections for Hamburg&#x27;s parliament, the &quot;Bürgerschaft&quot;, on 23 September 2001.
Following the elections, his party entered into a coalition government with the CDU led by Ole von Beust. Schill became second mayor of Hamburg and senator (equivalent of minister) of the interior; among other things, he announced that he would lower crime rates by 50% within 100 days, an undertaking which remained unsuccessful.

==Controversies==
As a politician, Schill managed to get considerable media attention with his radical positions; among other things, he spoke out for the legalization of cannabis, demanded that sex offenders who did not respond to therapy be castrated, and stated that parents who failed to bring up their children &quot;the right way&quot; should be jailed. Furthermore, following the Moscow theater hostage crisis in October 2002, where 129 of 800 hostages were killed by an unknown chemical agent employed by the authorities to incapacitate the hostage-takers, he proposed that similar gas should also be used by German police to fight terrorism.

Shortly after assuming office, Schill was anonymously accused of cocaine abuse. He voluntarily underwent hair analysis which did not yield any evidence of cocaine consumption, and after the findings had been made public, the prosecution authorities stopped their proceedings against Schill.

===2002 Bundestag speech===
Schill managed to cause a stir and a wave of indignation throughout the whole of Germany when he spoke in front of the Bundestag, Germany&#x27;s federal parliament, in the final session of the 14th Bundestag on 29 August 2002. Though he was not a Member of the Bundestag, he was a Member of the Bundesrat as a Hamburg Senator. Members of the Bundesrat have the right to address the Bundestag at any time. In his speech, he said that the victims of the Elbe flood would not be able to be compensated due to too much money being given to foreign countries; he also berated politicians of all parties, his speech culminating in the words &quot;We (in Germany) without doubt [...] have the most capable people, but the most incompetent politicians&quot; (&quot;Wir haben (in Deutschland) ohne Zweifel die tüchtigsten Menschen, aber [...] die unfähigsten Politiker&quot;).

He further reviled politicians by stating that they wasted money, went through the world with a &quot;goblet of charity&quot; to give away German tax money, brought refugees into the country and build &quot;glamorous solitary cells&quot; for prisoners; after accusing the parliament&#x27;s vice president Anke Fuchs of violating the constitution, already over his time quota, he first was warned, then asked to finish his speech, and finally had the microphone turned off 15 minutes after the end of his timeshare.

==Removal as senator==
In the summer of 2003 he made headlines again when another government official, Walter Wellinghausen, who held the office of a &quot;Staatsrat&quot; and was supported by Schill, was accused of illegally having a second employment; finally, Schill was removed from office by first mayor Ole von Beust (CDU) on 19 August 2003, due to &quot;not being qualified (for the position) with regard to his character&quot; (&quot;charakterlich nicht geeignet&quot;).

This was preceded by a private discussion between von Beust and Schill, in which von Beust announced his intent to remove Wellinghausen from office. According to von Beust, Schill then threatened to make public an alleged love affair between von Beust and judiciary senator Roger Kusch (CDU), which would have resulted in a conflict of interests on von Beust&#x27;s side.

Schill, on the other hand, told the press that he only had appealed to von Beust to not apply double standards, claiming that he mentioned the case of his fellow party member Mario Mettbach, who cancelled his decision to hire his significant other as an abstractor; he further stated that this collided with von Beust&#x27;s making Kusch a senator and that the public had a right to be informed about these issues. Kusch publicly came out as gay soon afterwards; von Beust, however, did not comment further on his sexuality, pointing out that his sexual orientation was a private issue alone.

Schill&#x27;s removal from office was appreciated by many organizations, including the churches and the police union, even though Schill continued to be a member of Hamburg&#x27;s &quot;Bürgerschaft&quot;.

On 6 December 2003, the federal executive board of the Party for a Rule of Law Offensive, led by Mario Mettbach, removed Schill from his office as the party&#x27;s chairman for Hamburg and denied him the right to assume further offices in the party. In response, Schill publicly ridiculed the party&#x27;s executive board, stating that he could just as well have been removed from office by his haircutter.

Three days later, von Beust declared the coalition of CDU, FDP and Schill Party to be terminated and asked the parliament to order new elections. Another week later, on 16 December 2003, the Schill Party&#x27;s federal executive board decided to expel Schill from the party.

On 18 December 2003, Schill, together with five former members of the Schill Party faction in the Hamburg state parliament, formed a new faction; his former partner, Katrin Freund, was elected chairwoman. He announced that if he did not manage to get 5% of all votes in the forthcoming parliamentary elections (and thus not be present in the new parliament), he would emigrate from Germany.

In the elections, on 29 February 2004, his group won only 3.1% of the votes. He confirmed that he would emigrate, &quot;probably to South America.&quot;

==Since 2004==
In fall 2004, Schill emigrated to Cuba.

In late 2006, Hamburg Police issued a search warrant for him, as he is to testify as a witness in front of a Hamburg state parliament board of inquiry. As of December 2006, Schill was thought to be in the Rio de Janeiro area. In December 2007 he appeared in Itzehoe and was ordered to testify in front of the aforementioned board.

In March 2008, the German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; reported that they were in possession of a video showing Schill consuming cocaine in Brazil. In the video he stated that as a judge he had regularly meted out harsher punishments to blacks, whom he disliked intensely. He also stated that his first cocaine test in 2001 yielded a positive result, but a retest with a less sensitive method then gave the desired negative result. Excerpts of this video were made available on YouTube.

Since 2014, Schill has appeared in inexpensively produced TV reality shows on German cable channels.

<doc id="408483" wikidata="Q632503" url="?curid=408483" title="USS John Marshall">
<text>USS &quot;John Marshall&quot; (SSBN-611) was an , the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for John Marshall (1755–1835), the fourth Chief Justice of the United States. Originally a fleet ballistic missile submarine designated SSBN-611, she later was reclassified as an attack submarine and re-designated SSN-611.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;John Marshall&quot;″s keel was laid down on 4 April 1960 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 15 July 1961 sponsored by Ethel (Skakel) Kennedy, wife of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and commissioned on 21 May 1962 with Commander Robert W. Stecher commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Robert D. Donavan commanding the Gold Crew.

== Service as a fleet ballistic missile submarine, 1962 – 1980 ==

&quot;John Marshall&quot; began her sea trials on 8 April 1962. On 21 May, &quot;John Marshall&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet as a unit of Submarine Squadron 14 (SUBRON14). On 31 May, she began her shakedown cruise, which culminated on 12 July with the successful firing of two Polaris A-2 missiles by the Blue crew and followed by the launch of three more by the Gold crew within days
off Cape Canaveral, Florida. In October, with a port call in İzmir, Turkey, she became the first U.S. FBM to visit a foreign port.
On 31 December, &quot;John Marshall&quot; sailed for her first Polaris patrol. Manned by the Blue crew, she became the ninth operational fleet ballistic missile submarine.

From 4 April 1963 to 30 November 1966, the Blue and Gold crews conducted a total of seventeen deterrent patrols from Holy Loch, Scotland.

On 13 December 1966, &quot;John Marshall&quot; started her first major overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding. The overhaul was completed in April 1968. After the post-overhaul shakedown, she loaded ballistic missiles at Charleston, South Carolina, and in September 1968 began her eighteenth deterrent patrol. She conducted her 19th through 25th deterrent patrols from Holy Loch between October 1968 and June 1970. In June 1970, she became a unit of Submarine Squadron 16 and began operations from Rota, Spain.

She conducted her 26th through 37th deterrent patrols from Rota. She was awarded her first Meritorious Unit Commendation as a result of an operation conducted in March 1971 that demonstrated the effectiveness and dependability of the fleet ballistic missile system. In June 1973, she returned to New London, Connecticut, for a dependents cruise, then conducted two deterrent patrols from Charleston, South Carolina.

On 1 November 1974, &quot;John Marshall&quot; began her second refueling overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California. During this overhaul, the missile systems were converted to support the Polaris A-3 missile. The overhaul was completed in May 1976 and &quot;John Marshall&quot; commenced strategic deterrent patrols in February 1977 as a unit of Submarine Squadron 15. she conducted her 40th through 54th deterrent patrols from Apra Harbor, Guam. Her final deterrent patrol concluded with her arrival at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 28 December 1980.

== Service as an attack submarine, 1981 – 1992 ==

On 12 January 1981, &quot;John Marshall&quot; was reclassified as an attack submarine and given hull number SSN-611. She began operations as an attack submarine from Pearl Harbor. Her last Polaris missile was removed in Bangor, Washington, on 1 June 1981.

&quot;John Marshall&quot; arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, on 20 July 1981 and began operations as a unit of Submarine Squadron 4. On 28 December 1981, she departed for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. The deployment included several major fleet exercises and visits to La Maddalena, Italy; Naples, Italy; Tangiers, Morocco; and Lisbon, Portugal. She returned to Charleston on 21 May 1982, twenty years to the day after she was commissioned.

In September 1983, &quot;John Marshall&quot; again transferred to the Pacific Fleet and arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, on 29 September to start her third overhaul. She (along with her sister, )
was modified to support operations. This included the installation of additional troop berthing, the removal of some ballistic missile tube bases, and the conversion of other ballistic missile tubes into air locks and stowage for equipment. She was fitted with two Dry Deck Shelters (DDSs) abaft her sail. These, which house SEAL team Swimmer Delivery Vehicles, allow her to act as a SEAL mother ship. Post-overhaul sea trials were conducted in September 1985 and &quot;John Marshall&quot; joined Submarine Squadron 6 in Norfolk, Virginia, in November 1985.

On 15 December 1986, &quot;John Marshall&quot; began her transit for her second deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. The deployment included several exercises and a demonstration of her unique special warfare capability and visits to Toulon, France; and La Maddalena, Italy. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 May 1987.

In September 1987, &quot;John Marshall&quot; conducted a special operational demonstration near Puerto Rico with SEAL Team Two. Aircraft carrier battlegroup exercises, special acoustic trials, and dry deck shelter operations continued through 1988. She made her 1,000th dive on 25 October 1988, off Puerto Rico.

On 1 May 1989, after conducting a variety of exercises with aircraft carrier battlegroups and other submarines, &quot;John Marshall&quot; departed for her third Mediterranean deployment. It was the first time a submarine had deployed anywhere in the world with two dry deck shelters on board, adding a unique flexibility and endurance to the fleet commander for special warfare operations. Embarked when &quot;John Marshall&quot; departed Norfolk was the largest special warfare detachment in the Atlantic or Mediterranean. During the 1989 deployment, &quot;John Marshall&quot;″s response to contingency operations, providing forward area support of a unique nature on extremely short notice, as well as her success in antisubmarine warfare operations, was recognized in the award to &quot;John Marshall&quot; of the Meritorious Unit Commendation. &quot;John Marshall&quot; returned to Norfolk in September 1989.

&quot;John Marshall&quot; conducted three special warfare training exercises in the Caribbean Sea in 1990, including a highly successful exercise that featured the employment of submarine-launched mobile mines.

On 26 January 1991, &quot;John Marshall&quot; departed Norfolk for her fourth and final deployment to the Mediterranean. Equipped once again with two dry deck shelters, she operated in direct support of Operation Desert Storm and provided significant capability options to the United States Sixth Fleet commander. She visited Toulon, Gibraltar, and La Maddalena, returning to Norfolk on 22 June 1991.

In September 1991, &quot;John Marshall&quot; served as flagship for the largest submarine special warfare exercise since World War II. Over 191 personnel, including three flag officers, U.S. Navy SEALs, and United States Army special forces, embarked to conduct joint special operations during Exercise Phantom Shadow.

&quot;John Marshall&quot; transited to the Pacific in early 1992 to begin deactivation at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where she was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 July 1992. She was disposed of through the Nuclear Power Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 29 March 1993.

==Commemoration==
&quot;John Marshall&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell is on display at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia.

In 2012, BIC issued a series of lighters commemorating the United States Armed Forces, with proceeds benefiting the USO. A photograph of the &quot;John Marshall&quot; sail taken while the boat was cruising on the surface was used for one depiction of the United States Navy.

<text>Russian formalism was a school of literary theory in Russia from the 1910s to the 1930s. It includes the work of a number of highly influential Russian and Soviet scholars such as Viktor Shklovsky, Yuri Tynianov, Vladimir Propp, Boris Eichenbaum, Roman Jakobson, Boris Tomashevsky, Grigory Gukovsky who revolutionised literary criticism between 1914 and the 1930s by establishing the specificity and autonomy of poetic language and literature. Russian formalism exerted a major influence on thinkers like Mikhail Bakhtin and Juri Lotman, and on structuralism as a whole. The movement&#x27;s members had a relevant influence on modern literary criticism, as it developed in the structuralist and post-structuralist periods. Under Stalin it became a pejorative term for elitist art.

Russian formalism was a diverse movement, producing no unified doctrine, and no consensus amongst its proponents on a central aim to their endeavours. In fact, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; describes two distinct movements: the OPOJAZ (&quot;Obshchestvo Izucheniia Poeticheskogo Yazyka&quot;, Society for the Study of Poetic Language) in St. Petersburg and the Moscow Linguistic Circle. Therefore, it is more precise to refer to the &quot;Russian Formalists&quot;, rather than to use the more encompassing and abstract term of &quot;Formalism&quot;.

The term &quot;formalism&quot; was first used by the adversaries of the movement, and as such it conveys a meaning explicitly rejected by the Formalists themselves. In the words of one of the foremost Formalists, Boris Eikhenbaum: &quot;It is difficult to recall who coined this name, but it was not a very felicitous coinage. It might have been convenient as a simplified battle cry but it fails, as an objective term, to delimit the activities of the &#x27;Society for the Study of Poetic Language&#x27;.&quot; Russian Formalism is the name now given to a mode of criticism which emerged from two different groups, The Moscow Linguistic Circle (1915) and the Opojaz group (1916). Although Russian Formalism is often linked to American New Criticism because of their similar emphasis on close reading, the Russian Formalists regarded themselves as developers of a science of criticism and are more interested in a discovery of systematic method for the analysis of poetic text.

==Distinctive ideas==

Russian formalism is distinctive for its emphasis on the functional role of literary devices and its original conception of literary history. Russian Formalists advocated a &quot;scientific&quot; method for studying poetic language, to the exclusion of traditional psychological and cultural-historical approaches. As Erlich points out, &quot;It was intent upon delimiting literary scholarship from contiguous disciplines such as psychology, sociology, intellectual history, and the list theoreticians focused on the &#x27;distinguishing features&#x27; of literature, on the artistic devices peculiar to imaginative writing&quot; (&quot;The New Princeton Encyclopedia&quot; 1101).

Two general principles underlie the Formalist study of literature: first, literature itself, or rather, those of its features that distinguish it from other human activities, must constitute the object of inquiry of literary theory; second, &quot;literary facts&quot; have to be prioritized over the metaphysical commitments of literary criticism, whether philosophical, aesthetic or psychological (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 16). To achieve these objectives several models were developed.

The formalists agreed on the autonomous nature of poetic language and its specificity as an object of study for literary criticism. Their main endeavor consisted in defining a set of properties specific to poetic language, be it poetry or prose, recognizable by their &quot;artfulness&quot; and consequently analyzing them as such.

==Types==
===Mechanistic===

The OPOJAZ, the Society for the Study of Poetic Language group, headed by Viktor Shklovsky was primarily concerned with the Formal method and focused on technique and device. &quot;Literary works, according to this model, resemble machines: they are the result of an intentional human activity in which a specific skill transforms raw material into a complex mechanism suitable for a particular purpose&quot; (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 18). This approach strips the literary artifact from its connection with the author, reader, and historical background.

A clear illustration of this may be provided by the main argument of one of Viktor Shklovsky&#x27;s early texts, &quot;Art as Device&quot; (&quot;Iskússtvo kak priyóm&quot;, 1916): art is a sum of literary and artistic devices that the artist manipulates to craft his work.

Shklovsky&#x27;s main objective in &quot;Art as Device&quot; is to dispute the conception of literature and literary criticism common in Russia at that time. Broadly speaking, literature was considered, on the one hand, to be a social or political product, whereby it was then interpreted in the tradition of the great critic Belinsky as an integral part of social and political history. On the other hand, literature was considered to be the personal expression of an author&#x27;s world vision, expressed by means of images and symbols. In both cases, literature is not considered as such, but evaluated on a broad socio-political or a vague psychologico-impressionistic background. The aim of Shklovsky is therefore to isolate and define something specific to literature or &quot;poetic language&quot;: these, as we saw, are the &quot;devices&quot; which make up the &quot;artfulness&quot; of literature.

Formalists do not agree with one another on exactly what a device or &quot;priyom&quot; is, nor how these devices are used or how they are to be analyzed in a given text. The central idea is that more general: poetic language possesses specific properties, which can be analyzed as such.

Some OPOJAZ members argued that poetic language was the major artistic device. Shklovsky insisted that not all artistic texts defamiliarize language, and that some of them achieve defamiliarization (&quot;ostranenie&quot;) by manipulating composition and narrative.

The Formalist movement attempted to discriminate systematically between art and non-art. Therefore, its notions are organized in terms of polar oppositions. One of the most famous dichotomies introduced by the mechanistic Formalists is a distinction between story and plot, or fabula and &quot;sjuzhet&quot;. Story, fabula, is a chronological sequence of events, whereas plot, sjuzhet, can unfold in non-chronological order. The events can be artistically arranged by means of such devices as repetition, parallelism, gradation, and retardation.

The mechanistic methodology reduced literature to a variation and combination of techniques and devices devoid of a temporal, psychological, or philosophical element. Shklovsky very soon realized that this model had to be expanded to embrace, for example, contemporaneous and diachronic literary traditions (Garson 403).

===Organic===
Disappointed by the constraints of the mechanistic method some Russian Formalists adopted the organic model. &quot;They utilized the similarity between organic bodies and literary phenomena in two different ways: as it applied to individual works and to literary genres&quot; (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 19).

An artefact, like a biological organism, is not an unstructured whole; its parts are hierarchically integrated. Hence the definition of the device has been extended to its function in text. &quot;Since the binary opposition – material vs. device – cannot account for the organic unity of the work, Zhirmunsky augmented it in 1919 with a third term, the teleological concept of style as the unity of devices&quot; (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 19).

The analogy between biology and literary theory provided the frame of reference for genre studies and genre criticism. &quot;Just as each individual organism shares certain features with other organisms of its type, and species that resemble each other belong to the same genus, the individual work is similar to other works of its form and homologous literary forms belong to the same genre&quot; (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 19). The most widely known work carried out in this tradition is Vladimir Propp&#x27;s &quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot; (1928).

Having shifted the focus of study from an isolated technique to a hierarchically structured whole, the organic Formalists overcame the main shortcoming of the mechanists. Still, both groups failed to account for the literary changes which affect not only devices and their functions but genres as well.

===Systemic===

The diachronic dimension was incorporated into the work of the systemic Formalists. The main proponent of the &quot;systemo-functional&quot; model was Yury Tynyanov. &quot;In light of his concept of literary evolution as a struggle among competing elements, the method of parody, &#x27;the dialectic play of devices,&#x27; become an important vehicle of change&quot; (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 21).

Since literature constitutes part of the overall cultural system, the literary dialectic participates in cultural evolution. As such, it interacts with other human activities, for instance, linguistic communication. The communicative domain enriches literature with new constructive principles. In response to these extra-literary factors the self-regulating literary system is compelled to rejuvenate itself constantly. Even though the systemic Formalists incorporated the social dimension into literary theory and acknowledged the analogy between language and literature the figures of author and reader were pushed to the margins of this paradigm.

===Linguistic===

The figures of author and reader were likewise downplayed by the linguistic Formalists Lev Jakubinsky and Roman Jakobson. The adherents of this model placed poetic language at the center of their inquiry. As Warner remarks, &quot;Jakobson makes it clear that he rejects completely any notion of emotion as the touchstone of literature. For Jakobson, the emotional qualities of a literary work are secondary to and dependent on purely verbal, linguistic facts&quot; (71).

As Ashima Shrawan explains, &quot;The theoreticians of OPOJAZ distinguished between practical and poetic language . . . . Practical language is used in day-to-day communication to convey information. . . . In poetic language, according to Lev Jakubinsky, &#x27;the practical goal retreats into background and linguistic combinations acquire a value in themselves. When this happens, language becomes de-familiarized and utterances become poetic (&quot;The Language of Literature and Its Meaning&quot;, 68).

Eichenbaum criticised Shklovsky and Jakubinsky for not disengaging poetry from the outside world completely, since they used the emotional connotations of sound as a criterion for word choice. This recourse to psychology threatened the ultimate goal of formalism to investigate literature in isolation.

A definitive example of focus on poetic language is the study of Russian versification by Osip Brik. Apart from the most obvious devices such as rhyme, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and assonance, Brik explores various types of sound repetitions, e.g. the ring (kol&#x27;co), the juncture (styk), the fastening (), and the tail-piece (koncovka) (&quot;Zvukovye povtory&quot; (Sound Repetitions); 1917). He ranks phones according to their contribution to the &quot;sound background&quot; (zvukovoj fon) attaching the greatest importance to stressed vowels and the least to reduced vowels. As Mandelker indicates, &quot;his methodological restraint and his conception of an artistic &#x27;unity&#x27; wherein no element is superfluous or disengaged, … serves well as an ultimate model for the Formalist approach to versification study&quot; (335).

====Textual analysis====

In &quot;A Postscript to the Discussion on Grammar of Poetry,&quot; Jakobson redefines poetics as &quot;the linguistic scrutiny of the poetic function within the context of verbal messages in general, and within poetry in particular&quot; (23). He fervently defends linguists&#x27; right to contribute to the study of poetry and demonstrates the aptitude of the modern linguistics to the most insightful investigation of a poetic message. The legitimacy of &quot;studies devoted to questions of metrics or strophics, alliterations or rhymes, or to questions of poets&#x27; vocabulary&quot; is hence undeniable (23). Linguistic devices that transform a verbal act into poetry range &quot;from the network of distinctive features to the arrangement of the entire text&quot; (Jakobson 23).

Jakobson opposes the view that &quot;an average reader&quot; uninitiated into the science of language is presumably insensitive to verbal distinctions: &quot;Speakers employ a complex system of grammatical relations inherent to their language even though they are not capable of fully abstracting and defining them&quot; (30). A systematic inquiry into the poetic problems of grammar and the grammatical problems of poetry is therefore justifiable; moreover, the linguistic conception of poetics reveals the ties between form and content indiscernible to the literary critic (Jakobson 34).

==Literature definition attempts==
Roman Jakobson described literature as &quot;organized violence committed on ordinary speech.&quot; Literature constitutes a deviation from average speech that intensifies, invigorates, and estranges the mundane speech patterns. In other words, for the Formalists, literature is set apart because it is just that: set apart. The use of devices such as imagery, rhythm, and meter is what separates &quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns (Nabokov &quot;Lolita&quot; 9)&quot;, from &quot;the assignment for next week is on page eighty four.&quot;

This estrangement serves literature by forcing the reader to think about what might have been an ordinary piece of writing about a common life experience in a more thoughtful way. A piece of writing in a novel versus a piece of writing in a fishing magazine. At the very least, literature should encourage readers to stop and look closer at scenes and happenings they otherwise might have skimmed through uncaring. The reader is not meant to be able to skim through literature. When addressed in a language of estrangement, speech cannot be skimmed through. &quot;In the routines of everyday speech, our perceptions of and responses to reality become stale, blunted, and as the Formalists would say &#x27;automatized&#x27;. By forcing us into a dramatic awareness of language, literature refreshes these habitual responses and renders objects more perceptible&quot; (Eagleton 3).

==Political offense==
One of the sharpest critiques of the Formalist project was Leon Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;Literature and Revolution&quot; (1924). Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that &quot;the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient&quot; because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: &quot;The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions&quot; (180, 171).

The leaders of the movement began to be politically persecuted in the 1920s, when Stalin came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. In the Soviet period under Joseph Stalin, the authorities further developed the term&#x27;s pejorative associations to cover any art which used complex techniques and forms accessible only to the elite, rather than being simplified for &quot;the people&quot; (as in socialist realism).

==Legacy==

Russian formalism was not a uniform movement; it comprised diverse theoreticians whose views were shaped through methodological debate that proceeded from the distinction between poetic and practical language to the overarching problem of the historical-literary study. It is mainly with this theoretical focus that the Formalist School is credited even by its adversaries such as Yefimov:

:The contribution of our literary scholarship lies in the fact that it has focused sharply on the basic problems of literary criticism and literary study, first of all on the specificity of its object, that it modified our conception of the literary work and broke it down into its component parts, that it opened up new areas of inquiry, vastly enriched our knowledge of literary technology, raised the standards of our literary research and of our theorizing about literature effected, in a sense, a Europeanization of our literary scholarship…. Poetics, once a sphere of unbridled impressionism, became an object of scientific analysis, a concrete problem of literary scholarship (&quot;Formalism V Russkom Literaturovedenii&quot;, quoted in Erlich, &quot;Russian Formalism: In Perspective&quot; 225).

The diverging and converging forces of Russian formalism gave rise to the Prague school of structuralism in the mid-1920s and provided a model for the literary wing of French structuralism in the 1960s and 1970s. &quot;And, insofar as the literary-theoretical paradigms which Russian Formalism inaugurated are still with us, it stands not as a historical curiosity but a vital presence in the theoretical discourse of our day&quot; (Steiner, &quot;Russian Formalism&quot; 29).

There is no direct historical relationship between New Criticism and Russian Formalism, each having developed at around the same time (RF: 1910-20s and NC: 1940s-50s) but independently of the other. Despite this, there are several similarities: for example, both movements showed an interest in considering literature on its own terms, instead of focusing on its relationship to political, cultural or historical externalities, a focus on the literary devices and the craft of the author, and a critical focus on poetry.

<text>Sally Anne Struthers (born July 28, 1947) is an American actress and activist. She played Gloria Stivic, the daughter of Archie and Edith Bunker in &quot;All in the Family&quot;, for which she won two Emmy Awards, and Babette on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. She was also the voice of Charlene Sinclair on the ABC sitcom &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, Pebbles Flintstone on &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot;, and Rebecca Cunningham on the Disney animated series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;.

==Early life==

Sally Anne Struthers was born on July 28, 1947, in Portland, Oregon, the second of two daughters born to Margaret Caroline (née Jernes) and Robert Alden Struthers, a surgeon. She has an older sister, Sue. Her maternal grandparents were Norwegian immigrants.

Her father abandoned the family when Struthers was approximately nine years old, after which she was raised by her single mother in the Concordia neighborhood of northeast Portland. Her mother, who supported herself and her two daughters working at Bonneville Power Administration, suffered from significant depression during Struthers&#x27; childhood.

==Career==
In &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970) Struthers was cast opposite Jack Nicholson. She appeared as a restless wife of a veterinarian in &quot;The Getaway&quot; starring Steve McQueen (1972). Around that time, Struthers debuted as Gloria Stivic on the 1970s sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot;; producer Norman Lear had found the actress dancing on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

According to a WPTT radio interview with Doug Hoerth in 2003, Struthers thought that Rob Reiner&#x27;s then-fiancée and later wife, Penny Marshall, would get the role of Gloria, as Marshall more resembled Jean Stapleton, who played Edith Bunker. Actress Candice Azzara had played the role of Gloria in a pilot episode, but was soon dropped. After a shaky start, the series became a hit beginning with its summer reruns, giving tens of millions of viewers the chance to see Gloria defending her viewpoints about negative stereotypes and inequality. Struthers won two Emmy Awards (in 1972 and 1979) for her work on the show. In 2012, Struthers recalled the serendipity that helped her land the role: 

In 1977 she portrayed a housewife who was physically abused by her husband (portrayed by Dennis Weaver) in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot;, one of the first network features to depict domestic violence.
On the short-lived &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; spin-off &quot;Gloria&quot; (1982–1983), Struthers reprised Gloria as a new divorcée (she became an &quot;exchange student,&quot; when husband Mike exchanged her for one of his students). The series co-starred Burgess Meredith as the doctor of an animal clinic with Gloria as his assistant. From 1985 to 1986 Struthers starred as Florence Ungar in the female version of &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot; Struthers later stated in an interview on &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast,&quot; that it was an unpleasant experience until Rita Moreno, who was mean-spirited towards Struthers, left the play and was replaced by Brenda Vaccaro.

She was a semi-regular panelist on the 1990 revival of &quot;Match Game&quot; and an occasional guest on &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; (even filling in for Vicki Lawrence as host for a week). She also had a recurring role as Bill Miller&#x27;s manipulative mother, Louise, on &quot;Still Standing&quot; and regularly appeared on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Babette Dell. She also provided voices for a number of animated series such as &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; (as a teenage Pebbles Flintstone), &quot;TaleSpin&quot; (as Rebecca Cunningham) and was one of the voice stars on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; produced by Walt Disney and Henson Productions (as Charlene Sinclair).

Struthers starred in the stage production of &quot;Annie&quot; at the Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, and in the national tour of the production in the late 1990s. She has been a regular since the early 2000s at the Ogunquit Playhouse, in Ogunquit, Maine.

In 2014, Struthers toured in the 50th-anniversary production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, playing Dolly Levi.

In 2024, Struthers played Virgina Foldau in the Netflix series &quot;Man on The Inside&quot;, starring Ted Danson.
In January 2025, &quot;The Life and Times of Norman Lear&quot; author Tripp Whetsell revealed that Struthers had a tense relationship with Norman Lear and tried to leave &quot;All In The Family&quot; after the fifth season, spending $40,000 in legal fees in an unsuccessful effort to get out of her contract.

==Activism==
Struthers was a spokesperson for Christian Children&#x27;s Fund (later renamed ChildFund), advocating on behalf of impoverished children in developing countries.

==Business interests==
Struthers has been a spokesperson for International Correspondence School (ICS) in television ads, pitching the famous line &quot;Do you want to make more money? Sure, we all do!&quot; ICS was a school with a diverse curriculum that, at the time, had fields of study going from brick laying to personal computers.

==Personal life==
Struthers married psychiatrist William C. Rader on December 18, 1977, in Los Angeles. After having one child, daughter Samantha, the couple divorced on January 19, 1983.

<doc id="408490" wikidata="Q312467" url="?curid=408490" title="Viktor Shklovsky">
<text>Viktor Borisovich Shklovsky (; – 6 December 1984) was a Russian and Soviet literary theorist, critic, writer, and pamphleteer. He is one of the major figures associated with Russian formalism.

Viktor Shklovsky&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Prose&quot; was published in 1925. Shklovsky himself is still praised as &quot;one of the most important literary and cultural theorists of the twentieth century&quot; (Modern Language Association Prize Committee); &quot;one of the most lively and irreverent minds of the last century&quot; (David Bellos); &quot;one of the most fascinating figures of Russian cultural life in the twentieth century&quot; (Tzvetan Todorov)

==Life==
Shklovsky was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. His father was a Lithuanian Jewish mathematician (with ancestors from Shklov) who converted to Russian Orthodoxy and his mother was of German-Russian origin. He attended St. Petersburg University.

During the First World War, he volunteered for the Russian Army and eventually became a driving trainer in an armoured car unit in St. Petersburg. There, in 1916, he founded OPOYAZ (Obshchestvo izucheniya POeticheskogo YAZyka—Society for the Study of Poetic Language), one of the two groups (with the Moscow Linguistic Circle) that developed the critical theories and techniques of Russian Formalism.

Shklovsky participated in the February Revolution of 1917. Subsequently, the Russian Provisional Government sent him as an assistant Commissar to the Southwestern Front where he was wounded and got an award for bravery. After that he was an assistant Commissar of the Russian Expeditionary Corps in Persia (see Persian Campaign).

Shklovsky returned to St. Petersburg in early 1918, after the October Revolution. During the Civil War he opposed Bolshevism and took part in an anti-Bolshevik plot organised by members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. After the conspiracy was discovered by the Cheka, Shklovsky went into hiding, traveling in Russia and Ukraine, but was eventually pardoned in 1919 due to his connections with Maxim Gorky, and decided to abstain from political activity. His two brothers were executed by the Soviet regime (one in 1918, the other in 1937) and his sister died from hunger in St. Petersburg in 1919.

Shklovsky integrated into Soviet society and even took part in the Russian Civil War, serving in the Red Army. However, in 1922, he had to go into hiding once again, as he was threatened with arrest and possible execution for his former political activities, and he fled via Finland to Germany. In Berlin, in 1923, he published his memoirs about the period 1917–22 under the title &#x27; (&#x27;, &quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot;), alluding to &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot; by Laurence Sterne, an author he much admired and whose digressive style had a powerful influence on Shklovsky&#x27;s writing. In the same year he was allowed to return to the Soviet Union, not least because of an appeal to Soviet authorities that he included in the last pages of his epistolary novel &quot;Zoo, or Letters Not About Love&quot;.

The Yugoslav scholar Mihajlo Mihajlov visited Shklovsky in 1963 and wrote: &quot;I was much impressed by Shklovsky&#x27;s liveliness of spirit, his varied interests and his enormous culture. When we said goodbye to Viktor Borisovich and started for Moscow, I felt that I had met one of the most cultured, most intelligent and best-educated men of our century.&quot;

He died in Moscow in 1984.

==Writer and theorist==
In addition to literary criticism and biographies about such authors as Laurence Sterne, Maxim Gorky, Leo Tolstoy, and Vladimir Mayakovsky, he wrote a number of semi-autobiographical works disguised as fiction, which also served as experiments in his developing theories of literature.

Shklovsky is perhaps best known for developing the concept of &quot;ostranenie&quot; or defamiliarization (also translated as &quot;estrangement&quot;) in literature. He explained the concept in 1917 in the important essay &quot;Art as Technique&quot; (also translated as &quot;Art as Device&quot;) which comprised the first chapter of his seminal &quot;Theory of Prose&quot;, first published in 1925. He argued for the need to turn something that has become over-familiar, like a cliché in the literary canon, into something revitalized:

Among other things, Shklovsky also contributed the plot/story distinction (syuzhet/fabula), which separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the plot) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the story).

Shklovsky&#x27;s work pushes Russian Formalism towards understanding literary activity as integral parts of social practice, an idea that becomes important in the work of Mikhail Bakhtin and Russian and Prague School scholars of semiotics. Shklovsky&#x27;s thought also influenced western thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov&#x27;s translations of the works of Russian formalists in the 1960s and 1970s, including Tzvetan Todorov himself, Gerard Genette and Hans Robert Jauss.

==Film==
Shklovsky was one of the very early serious writers on film. A collection of his essays and articles on film was published in 1923 (&quot;Literature and Cinematography&quot;, first English edition 2008). He was a close friend of director Sergei Eisenstein and published an extensive critical assessment of his life and works (Moscow 1976, no English translation).

Beginning in the 1920s and well into the 1970s Shklovsky worked as a screenwriter on numerous Soviet films (see &quot;Select Filmography&quot; below), a part of his life and work that, thus far, has seen very limited attention. In his book &quot;Third Factory&quot; Shklovsky reflects on his work in film, writing: &quot;First of all, I have a job at the third factory of Goskino.

<doc id="408491" wikidata="Q965458" url="?curid=408491" title="Alien Breed (video game)">
<text>Alien Breed is a top down run and gun video game released in 1991 by Team17 for the Amiga and later in 1993 by MicroLeague for MS-DOS. The game is the first in the &quot;Alien Breed&quot; series&quot;.

&quot;Alien Breed&quot; is based on the &quot;Alien&quot; films, specifically &quot;Aliens&quot;, and also on the 8-bit-era games &quot;Laser Squad&quot; and &quot;Paradroid&quot; as well as the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; arcade game.

== Gameplay ==
Players must find the lift down to the next level, occasionally setting the self-destruct sequence to blow up the level above them. The players collect or purchase a variety of weapons from the space station&#x27;s computer terminals. In some versions of the game, these so-called &quot;Intex&quot; terminals provide additional features such as a clone of the classic video game &quot;Pong&quot;. Credits found on the ground have to be saved for these weapons and other enhancements, each giving the players an edge over the gradually more and more powerful alien forces. In advanced levels, players are occasionally trapped in enclosed spaces with huge boss aliens.

== Release ==
Team17 made an &quot;intro disk&quot; available, containing a short animated introductory sequence with on-screen narration which follows events leading into the start of the game. After the introduction is finished, the player is prompted for disk one of the game, effectively making the introduction disk &quot;disk zero&quot;. Team17 produced a similar introduction disk for &quot;Superfrog&quot;, animated by Eric W. Schwartz, although this was included with the retail edition of the game.

== Reception ==
=== Amiga ===
&quot;Alien Breed&quot; was released to generally favorable reviews. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; wrote that &quot;Team17 have come up with a winner&quot;.

=== MS-DOS ===
The MS-DOS port&#x27;s reception was mixed. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; described the gameplay&#x27;s variety as lacking and the sound effects as &quot;shallow and tinny&quot;, with problems using the Pro Audio Spectrum sound card to be expected, but favorably compared it to Sega Genesis games and called it a &quot;solid shooter [with] plenty of high-octane fun.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; criticized the &quot;asinine&quot; copy protection, but said that it is still a good action title for those who like their play quick and simple&quot;. The magazine stated in the next issue that while &quot;right at home at the local arcade or any cartridge game machine&quot;, the DOS version of &quot;Alien Breed&quot; &quot;has fallen behind in the tech race&quot;. Citing the &quot;European&quot; use of mission codes instead of save games and &quot;pretty&quot; but shallow gameplay, the reviewer unfavorably compared it to &quot;Doom&quot;, with &quot;an almost identical (somewhat tired) premise&quot; but of which &quot;the execution makes all the difference&quot;. Despite the good graphics and &quot;fast-paced&quot; action, he concluded that &quot;Alien Breed&quot; was &quot;not suitable for the average computer gamer on this continent&quot;, but might be for the &quot;less demanding player&quot; or one who wanted a Nintendo.

In a critical review, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; pointed to the port&#x27;s bugs such as the screen flickering. The more serious bugs included not being able to buy weapons from any &quot;Intex&quot; terminal and the game crashing nearly a quarter of an hour into it. The reviewer concluded that the bugs overshadowed what was otherwise a faithful conversion of an Amiga classic.

James V. Trunzo reviewed &quot;Alien Breed&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #45 (July, 1994), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Good&quot; and stated that &quot;&quot;Alien Breed&quot; isn&#x27;t the cutting edge of science fiction action gaming, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s trying to be. It&#x27;s like a watered-down version of EA&#x27;s superior &quot;Space Hulk&quot;. For the money, it&#x27;s a fun beer &#x27;n&#x27; pretzels game that lets you vent hostilities on nasty critters - and you can even do it with a friend!&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Alien Breed Special Edition &#x27;92&quot; was an expanded version, published in 1992, at budget price. It was hugely popular, staying in the British software charts for more than a year. It also featured a film trailer-style advert for Team17&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Superfrog&quot;, which was unusual at the time. As well as being released on the Amiga, this version of the game was also released on the Amiga CD32 in a double-pack with &quot;Qwak&quot;.

Both the original and the &quot;Special Edition&quot; did well enough to merit further sequels, almost all of which have been commercial and critical successes.

The player characters in this game and its sequel were named Johnson and Stone. By the third game (&quot;Alien Breed: Tower Assault&quot;), the player characters were named John and Nash. In keeping with the &quot;Aliens&quot; theme, a female voiceover (the voice of Lynette Reade) provided warnings and other messages to the players.

In 2012, a port of &quot;Alien Breed&quot; for smartphones and tablets was released for iOS and Android, to very favourable reviews.

<text>Ealdorman ( , ) was an office in the government of Anglo-Saxon England. During the 11th century, it evolved into the title of earl.

==Early use==
The Old English word &quot;ealdorman&quot; was applied to high-ranking men. It was equated with several Latin titles, including , , , and . The title could be applied to kings of weaker territories who had submitted to a greater power. For example, a charter of King Offa of Mercia described Ealdred of Hwicce as &quot;&quot;subregulus&quot;... &quot;et dux&quot; ().&quot;

In Wessex, the king appointed ealdormen to lead individual shires. Under Alfred the Great (), there were nine or ten ealdormen. Each West Saxon shire had one, and Kent had two (one for East Kent and one for West Kent).

==10th century==
In the 10th century, the kings of Wessex successfully unified England into one kingdom, and ealdormen became the local representatives of the monarch. The ealdorman commanded the shire&#x27;s fyrd (army), co-presided with the bishop over the shire court, and enforced royal orders. He had a right to the &quot;third penny&quot;: one-third of the income from the shire court and one-third of the revenue from tolls and dues levied in the boroughs. The king could remove ealdormen.

Starting with Edward the Elder (), it became customary for one ealdorman to administer three or four shires together as an ealdormanry. One ealdormanry covered Wessex east of Selwood and another covered Wessex west of Selwood. By 965, Mercia had four or five ealdormen and Northumbria only one. The boundaries of the ealdormanries are unknown, and they may not have covered the entire kingdom. It is possible that the king kept some areas under his personal jurisdiction.

In the 11th century, the term &quot;eorl&quot;, today&#x27;s earl, replaced that of ealdorman, but this reflected a change in terminology under Danish influence rather than a change in function.

==Notable ealdormen==
* Æthelmund, Ealdorman of the Hwicce
* Ælfhere, ealdorman of Mercia (d. 983)
* Ælfhelm, ealdorman of southern Northumbria (d. &quot;c&quot;. 1006)
* Ælfric, ealdorman of Hampshire
* Æthelweard the Chronicler
* Byrhtnoth, ealdorman of Essex (d. 991)
* Eadric Streona, ealdorman of the Mercians (d. 1017)
* Odda, Ealdorman of Devon (fl. 878)
* Wulfhere, Ealdorman of Wiltshire (fl. &quot;c&quot;. 855–877)
* Wulfstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire (d. 802)

<text>USS &quot;Will Rogers&quot; (SSBN-659) (referred to as Willy R by her crews) was a ballistic missile submarine – the last of the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; Polaris submarines. She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for humorist Will Rogers (1879–1935).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to construct &quot;Will Rogers&quot; was awarded on 29 July 1963, and her keel was laid down on 20 March 1965 at Groton, Connecticut, by the General Dynamics Corporation&#x27;s Electric Boat Division. She was launched on 21 July 1966 sponsored by Muriel Buck Humphrey, the wife of Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey, and commissioned on 1 April 1967 with Captain R. Y. Kaufman in command of the Blue Crew and Commander W. J. Cowhill in command of the Gold crew.

==Service history==

Following shakedown, &quot;Will Rogers&quot; culminated her initial training and work-up by conducting a successful Polaris ballistic missile launch on the Atlantic Missile Range off Cape Kennedy, Florida, on 31 July 1967. In October 1967, she began her first strategic deterrent patrol.

&quot;Will Rogers&quot; was based at Groton until 1974 when she shifted to a forward deployment at Naval Station Rota, Spain. Around this time, she was converted to carry Poseidon ballistic missiles, and her nuclear reactor was modified to use an S3G core 3. She conducted additional deterrent deployments from Rota into 1978, bringing the total number of patrols she had conducted to 35.

From the latter half of 1978 until November 1991 &quot;Will Rogers&quot; was forward deployed at Site One in Holy Loch, Scotland. On 9 November 1991, &quot;Will Rogers&quot; departed Site One, the last submarine to leave Holy Loch before Submarine Squadron 14, which had been based there, was deactivated.

==Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal==
Deactivated while still in commission, &quot;Will Rogers&quot; entered the U.S Navy″s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington on 2 November 1992. She was formally both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 April 1993. Scrapping via the recycling program was completed on 12 August 1994.

<doc id="408517" wikidata="Q232235" url="?curid=408517" title="Barbara Strozzi">
<text>Barbara Strozzi (also called Barbara Valle; baptised 6 August 1619  – 11 November 1677) was an Italian composer and singer of the Baroque Period. During her lifetime, Strozzi published eight volumes of her own music, and had more secular music in print than any other composer of the era. This was achieved without support from the Church or consistent patronage from the nobility.

==Personal life==

=== Early life and childhood ===
Barbara Strozzi (at birth, Barbara Valle) was born in Venice in 1619 to a woman known as &quot;La Greghetta&quot; (in other sources she is also referred to as Isabella Griega or Isabella Garzoni). She was baptized in the church of Santa Sofia in the Cannaregio district of Venice. Although her birth certificate does not state her father&#x27;s identity, it is assumed that her biological father was Giulio Strozzi, a poet and librettist, and a very influential figure in seventeenth-century Venice. He was a member of the &quot;Accademia degli Incogniti&quot;, one of the largest and most prestigious intellectual academies in Europe and a major political and social force in the Republic of Venice and beyond. He wrote in many literary media, for example, poetry, operas, prose, plays and lyrics for songs. Little is known about Barbara&#x27;s mother, but historians suspect that Isabella was a servant of Giulio, as both Barbara and her mother lived in Giulio&#x27;s household and were listed in his will. Although Barbara was an illegitimate child, her father Giulio referred to her as his &quot;adoptive daughter&quot; and was instrumental in helping her establish her career as a musician later in her life. Barbara grew up in a household frequented by the greatest literary and musical minds of the age.

More detailed accounts of Barbara&#x27;s life concern the end of her childhood and early adolescence. Throughout her childhood, Venice had suffered plagues that killed much of its population. Barbara and her mother survived. She reached the age of 12 by the first Festa della Salute in 1631. By this time, she had begun to develop as a musician and to demonstrate virtuosic vocal talent. Alongside this, she developed the ability to accompany herself on the lute or theorbo. In her book &quot;Sounds and Sweet Airs&quot;, historian Anna Beer states that Strozzi&#x27;s musical gifts became more evident in her early adolescence, which led Giulio to arrange lessons in composition for her with one of the leading composers, Francesco Cavalli. By the age of 15, Barbara was described as &quot;la virtuosissima cantatrice di Giulio Strozzi&quot; (Giulio Strozzi&#x27;s extremely virtuosic singer). Around Barbara&#x27;s 16th birthday, Giulio started to publicise her talents, ensuring dedications of works for her. Giulio subsequently established the &quot;Accademia degli Unisoni&quot;, a subsidiary of the &quot;Incogniti&quot;, which welcomed musicians into the privileged social circle. &quot;Unisoni&quot;, operating from the Strozzi household, ensured Barbara opportunities of performing as a singer, as well as semi-public performances of her own works. In 1637, at the age of 18, Barbara took her father&#x27;s last name, Strozzi, keeping it until her death.

=== Later life, children and death ===
Little is known of Strozzi&#x27;s life during the 1640s. However, it is assumed that she was the concubine of a Venetian nobleman, Giovanni Paolo Vidman. He was a patron of the arts and an associate of Giulio Strozzi. Although Strozzi never married him (or anyone), the relationship led to three or, possibly four children. Vidman was the father of her son Giulio, then of two daughters, Isabella in 1642 and Laura in 1644, and possibly of a further son, Massimo. Her two daughters joined a convent and one of her sons became a monk. A letter written after Strozzi&#x27;s death reports she &quot;was raped by Count Vidman, a Venetian nobleman. She had a son who also [that is, like her father] bears the name Giulio Strozzi.&quot; It has been suggested that the rape allegation may have been a story circulated to protect Strozzi&#x27;s reputation, as she had children out of wedlock. However, there is evidence to suggest that she was coerced into the relationship.

During this time, there were financial dealings between Strozzi and Vidman. It is believed that she gave him a loan that would have to be repaid after his death. The near 10% interest might have been a way of ensuring some support for Strozzi and her children after his death.

Strozzi died in Padua in 1677 aged 58. She is believed to have been buried at Eremitani. She did not leave a will so, on her death, her son Giulio Pietro claimed her inheritance in full.

== Professional life ==

=== Life as a young musician ===
By her late teens, Strozzi had started to gain a reputation for her singing. In 1635 and 1636, two volumes of songs were published by Nicole Fontei, called the &quot;Bizzarrie poetiche&quot; (poetic oddities), full of praise for Strozzi&#x27;s singing ability. The performance experience that she had at &quot;Unisoni&quot; equipped her with the vocal expertise that also manifested itself in her later publications, signifying her compositional talent.

As a young musician, Strozzi sought out patronage, but was not always successful. Her opus 2, dedicated to Ferdinand III of Austria and Eleanora of Mantua on the occasion of their marriage, went unnoticed. Other notable dedicatees include Anne de&#x27; Medici, the Archduchess of Austria, Nicolò Sagredo, later Doge of Venice, for whom she dedicated her opus 7, and Sophia, Duchess of Brunswick and Lüneburg. She is also assumed to have composed several songs for the Duke of Mantua in 1665, a year after her last known published works.

=== Professional career ===

Strozzi was said to be &quot;the most prolific composer – man or woman – of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the middle of the [17th] century.&quot; Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs. She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.

=== Compositional style ===
Like many of her contemporary composers, Strozzi mostly utilized texts from the poet Marino. These Marinist texts would serve as a vehicle to express herself as well as to challenge the gender roles of her time. &quot;Il primo libro di madrigali&quot;, per 2–5 voci e basso continuo, op. 1 (1644), was dedicated to Vittoria della Rovere, the Venetian-born Grand Duchess of Tuscany. The text is a poem by her father, Giulio Strozzi. Strozzi published one known work of religious pieces. Her opus 5, written in 1655, was dedicated to the Archduchess of Innsbruck, Anna de Medici. Her motet &quot;Mater Anna&quot; paid homage not only to the Catholic saint/mother of the virgin Mary but also to the archduchess. Strozzi was highly sensitive to the subliminal meaning in her texts, and, as is the case with Arcangela Tarabotti, the texts she set often hinted at underlying issues regarding gender.

<doc id="408523" wikidata="Q944287" url="?curid=408523" title="The Little Mermaid (TV series)">
<text>The Little Mermaid is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation based on the 1989 animated feature film of the same name. It features the adventures of Ariel as a mermaid prior to the events of the film. This series is the third Disney television series to be spun off from a major animated film. Some of the voice actors of the film reprise their roles in the series, among them Jodi Benson as Ariel, Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian, Kenneth Mars as King Triton, and Pat Carroll as Ursula. Other voice actors include Edan Gross as Flounder, and Jeff Bennett as Prince Eric.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; premiered on September 11, 1992, with the animated prime time special called &quot;A Whale of a Tale,&quot; then moved to Saturday mornings. This series originally appeared on CBS, with an original run from September 11, 1992, to November 26, 1994. Some of the episodes contain musical segments, featuring original songs written for the series. The opening theme to the show is an instrumental combination of the songs &quot;Part of Your World,&quot; &quot;Under the Sea,&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girl.&quot; The overture for the 2007 stage musical of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is similar to this.

==Premise==
&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is a prequel to the movie of the same name. The story is set between the 2008 prequel film &quot;The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot; and Disney&#x27;s 1989 animated feature film, and follows Ariel&#x27;s adventures as a mermaid still living under the sea with her father King Triton, Sebastian the crab and Flounder the fish. Various episodes highlight her relationships with her friends, father and sisters, and usually involve Ariel foiling the attempts of various enemies that intend ill harm to her, her family and friends, or her kingdom. &quot;Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot; contains events that contradict the television series (such as Ariel&#x27;s youth and first meeting with Flounder), making the TV series and the prequel independent continuities.

==Characters==
==Production and development==
After the success of Disney&#x27;s 1989 animated feature film, The Walt Disney Company planned to produce a children&#x27;s television series for its Disney Channel cable outlet called &quot;The Little Mermaid&#x27;s Island&quot;. The proposed series would feature puppets from Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop interacting with a &quot;live&quot; Ariel. But after Jim Henson&#x27;s untimely death along with production difficulties and as the video release of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; soared in sales during 1990 and early 1991, Disney quietly dropped plans for &quot;The Little Mermaid&#x27;s Island&quot; in favor of a more ambitious plan: an animated weekly series for CBS. The new show would be about the adventures of Ariel and her friends before the events in the film.

Jamie Mitchell, an artist and graphic designer who worked on &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, was named the producer and director of the new series. Patsy Cameron and Tedd Anasti were the story editors and wrote almost all of the episodes for the show&#x27;s second and third seasons. Their previous joint work included Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, the animated &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;DuckTales&quot;. Some of the artists and technicians on the feature film also contributed to the TV series. Mark Dindal, chief of special animated effects for the film, was a consultant for special effects on the TV show. Robby Merkin, who worked with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman on arranging the songs for the film, worked as the arranger and music producer for the first season of the TV show.

Disney Animation Japan and Wang Film Productions in Taiwan both contributed animation to the series.

== Release ==

=== Broadcast ===
The show&#x27;s broadcast debut in September 1992 was in the form of a half-hour prime-time special, &quot;The Little Mermaid: A Whale of a Tale&quot;. Its Saturday morning debut came the very next day. The show&#x27;s time slot was 8:30 a.m., following another new animated series, &quot;Fievel&#x27;s American Tails&quot;, based on the animated film &quot;An American Tail&quot;. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; series drew a fair bit of media attention, including more than one spot on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, because it was the first series based directly on a Disney animated feature and was a rare (at the time) television cartoon concerning a strong female character. The show kept its time slot the following year with its second season.

For the series&#x27; third season, the show was moved to the 8 a.m. time period and was the lead-in for a new Disney animated series, &quot;Aladdin&quot;. The third season was the final season to be produced; CBS elected not to buy another batch of episodes. On October 2, 1995, Disney Channel began rerunning the show seven days a week.

Disney Channel reran the series from October 2, 1995, to September 29, 2002, and again from September 5, 2006, to July 4, 2010. It was also shown on Toon Disney until January 25, 2008. The series then aired on Disney Junior from the channel&#x27;s launch in 2012 until 2014. However, in Russia, Disney Channel continued to air the series until the channel closed in 2022.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Caroline Siede of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the development of Ariel across the show, calling the character relatable and compelling, and said, &quot;&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; TV show finally gave Ariel the kind of adventure stories she deserves.&quot; Katerina Dailey of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; in their &quot;10 Best Disney TV Shows That Started As Movies&quot; list, stating, &quot;The film is a great watch even 30 years later. The same can be said, too, for the 1992 to 1994 animated series.&quot;

KJ Dell Antonia of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the series a grade of two out of five stars, writing, &quot;Spin-off sinks for everyone except besotted fans.&quot;

Following the casting of Halle Bailey as Ariel in the 2023 live-action remake of the 1989 &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; film, several journalists highlighted the character of Gabriella, a deaf mermaid of color appearing in the show. Sarah Kepins of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; asserted, &quot;Gabriella was loved and accepted. There was no negative backlash over her addition to the animated show, and her inclusion meant something very important to many people.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
==Spin-off==
The series received a spin-off entitled &quot;Sebastian the Crab&quot;, which aired as a segment of the TV series &quot;Marsupilami&quot;. The segments star Sebastian, and are set outside of the sea, taking place after the wedding between Ariel and Eric in the film.

<doc id="408529" wikidata="Q946606" url="?curid=408529" title="Raúl Grijalva">
<text>Raúl Manuel Grijalva ( ; born February 19, 1948) is an American politician and activist who has served as the United States representative for since 2023 and from 2003 to 2023. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district was numbered as the 7th from 2003 to 2013 and includes the western third of Tucson, part of Yuma and Nogales, and some peripheral parts of metro Phoenix. As of , Grijalva is the dean of Arizona&#x27;s congressional delegation.

In October 2024, Grijalva said he would not run for re-election in 2026.

==Early life, education and career==
Raúl Grijalva&#x27;s father was a migrant worker from Mexico who entered the United States in 1945 through the Bracero Program and labored on southern Arizona ranches. Grijalva was born on Canoa Ranch, 30 miles south of Tucson. He graduated from Sunnyside High School in 1967 and is a 2004 inductee to the Sunnyside High School Alumni Hall of Fame. He attended the University of Arizona and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology.

Grijalva was an Arizona leader of the Raza Unida Party. According to Armando Navarro&#x27;s history of the party, &quot;Grijalva was so militant that he alienated some members of Tucson&#x27;s Mexican-American community. After losing his first bid for elective office, a 1972 run for a seat on the school board, he began cultivating a less radical image.&quot;

In 1974, Grijalva was elected to the Tucson Unified School District board and served until 1986. Grijalva Elementary School in Tucson was named for him in 1987. From 1975 to 1986, Grijalva was the director of the El Pueblo Neighborhood Center, and in 1987, he was Assistant Dean for Hispanic Student Affairs at the University of Arizona. Grijalva was a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors from 1989 to 2002 and served as chair from 2000 to 2002. He resigned as a supervisor in 2002 to run for Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Tenure===

==== 108th Congress (2003-05) ====
Grijalva was elected as a Democrat to the 108th Congress in 2002, representing Arizona&#x27;s seventh congressional district. As a freshman congressman, the first bill he sponsored was H.R. 731, the Tohono O&#x27;odham Citizenship Act of 2003. Although the bill was not passed into law, it sought to grant American citizenship to all members of the Tohono Oʼodham. This federally recognized tribe has land that stretches from their reservation in Arizona across the U.S.–Mexico border into the Mexican state of Sonora, resulting in some of its members not being U.S. citizens.

====114th Congress (2015–17)====
In 2015, Grijalva settled a complaint accusing him of drunkenness and a &quot;hostile workplace environment&quot; with a female staffer who had been at her job for three months. The $48,000 payment was made from House of Representatives funds.

==== 116th Congress (2019–2021) ====
For his tenure as the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee in the 116th Congress, Grijalva earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the nonpartisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

In 2019, Grijalva was the subject of an Ethics Committee probe relating to his alcoholism and creating a &quot;hostile workplace.&quot; He has repeatedly come under fire for alcohol use, but has denied alcoholism.

====117th Congress (2021–23)====
Grijalva was at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, to certify the 2020 presidential electoral college votes when the Capitol was attacked by Donald Trump supporters. Moments after Grijalva finished speaking in support of certifying Arizona&#x27;s votes, insurrectionists started banging on the doors of the House chambers. He called the attack &quot;one of the darkest and most shameful days of our republic&quot; and the perpetrators &quot;domestic terrorists.&quot; Grijalva blamed President Donald Trump for inciting the attack and called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove Trump from office. After the 25th Amendment was not invoked, Grijalva supported impeaching Trump a second time. He voted to impeach Trump again on January 13, 2021.

In February, Grijalva voted in support of the American Rescue Plan, which included a nationwide $15 federal minimum wage increase. However, the Senate Parliamentarian removed the increase from the bill. As a result, Grijalva joined a group of progressive Democrats in calling to overturn the Parliamentarian&#x27;s ruling.

Grijalva voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Education and the Workforce
** Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education
** Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development
* Committee on Natural Resources (Ranking Member)
** In addition to the below, Rep. Grijalva is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in all subcommittee meetings per the committee rules.
** Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources

===Caucus memberships===
Grijalva is a member of several dozen caucuses. A full list is available at his website.
* Congressional Progressive Caucus
* Congressional Hispanic Caucus
* Congressional Equality Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Congressional Voting Rights Caucus
* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus
* Blue Collar Caucus
* House Pro-Choice Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
* Rare Disease Caucus

==Political positions==

Grijalva formerly co-chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus with Mark Pocan, having been replaced by Pramila Jayapal after stepping down in order to chair the House Committee on Natural Resources. In 2008, he was among 12 members rated by &quot;National Journal&quot; as tied for most liberal overall. On the ideological map of all House members at GovTrack&#x27;s website, Grijalva is ranked farthest to the left. Liberal and progressive activist groups routinely give him high marks for his voting record. Grijalva has received a 100% score from Americans for Democratic Action, Peace Action, the League of Conservation Voters, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Arab American Institute, and several other notable groups. At the start of the 114th Congress, Grijalva became the ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources.

Grijalva is an advocate of mining law reform and many other environmental causes. From his position on the House Committee on Natural Resources—where he has been the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands since 2007—he has led Democratic efforts to strengthen federal offshore oil drilling oversight since before the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and introduced a successful bill to create a permanent National Landscape Conservation System at the Bureau of Land Management. He was a leading candidate for Secretary of the Interior when President Barack Obama was elected, but the job eventually went to Ken Salazar; according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Obama made the decision in part because of Grijalva&#x27;s stated preference for more environmental analysis before approving offshore drilling projects.

Grijalva has been a vocal opponent of Arizona&#x27;s SB 1070 law, which mandates police checks of citizenship documentation for anyone subjected to a legitimate law enforcement stop, detention or arrest as long as the officer does not consider race, color or national origin during the stop, detention or arrest. Shortly after Arizona governor Jan Brewer signed the measure, Grijalva called on legal, political, activist and business groups not to hold their conventions or conferences in Arizona, a position he said quickly became misconstrued as a call for a general boycott of Arizona&#x27;s economy. In response, the Arizona Republican Party handed out bumper stickers reading &quot;Boycott Grijalva, Not Arizona&quot;. After a federal judge stopped implementation of most of SB 1070, Grijalva withdrew the boycott, saying that he had reacted to it &quot;very personally&quot;. In an interview, he said, &quot;to all of a sudden have a law that separates me from the whole I found very offensive and demeaning.&quot;

Grijalva criticized the 2010 deployment of 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.–Mexico border as &quot;political symbolism&quot; that he believed would not adequately address the issues of immigration and border security.

Grijalva often called for a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, and supports the wider implementation of the National Solidarity Program as a way to improve Afghans&#x27; economic and educational infrastructure. The group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America gave him an &quot;A&quot; rating for the 2007–08 congressional session.

Grijalva has a pro-choice voting record and voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. He was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which sought to place limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the Affordable Health Care for America Act. Grijalva opposed the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;about control&quot; and &quot;mostly men forcing women to carry a child against their will. It is about trapping women in our society in cycles of poverty, so that they cannot easily rise to challenge these men who fear their success.&quot;

===Budget proposals===
As co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Grijalva took a leading role in shaping CPC &quot;alternative budgets&quot;—budget bills offered by various groups and caucuses in Congress other than the official majority or minority party plan. In 2011 the CPC introduced what it called the People&#x27;s Budget, which reached budget balance in 10 years according to an assessment by the Economic Policy Institute based on nonpartisan government data. The proposal was noted approvingly by some of the world&#x27;s leading economists, including Jeffrey Sachs—who called it &quot;a bolt of hope ... humane, responsible, and most of all sensible&quot;—and Paul Krugman, who called it &quot;genuinely courageous&quot; for achieving budget balance &quot;without dismantling the legacy of the New Deal&quot;.

In 2012, again with Grijalva as co-chair, the Progressive Caucus introduced the Budget for All, which is similar to the People&#x27;s Budget and includes several new features, including a novel proposal to institute a small personal wealth tax above $10 million in net worth phased in over a period of five years. The proposal received 78 votes, all from Democrats, when the House considered it on March 29, 2012.

Grijalva was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

===Deepwater Horizon and oil rig safety===
On February 24, 2010, Grijalva wrote a letter signed by 18 other representatives calling for an investigation of the BP Atlantis offshore drilling platform due to whistleblower allegations that it was operating without approved safety documents. He has called for Atlantis to be shut down. Since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on April 20, 2010, Grijalva has written letters to the Minerals Management Service and the Department of the Interior questioning current offshore drilling regulations and calling for stronger oversight of the oil industry.

Grijalva has gained prominence as an outspoken critic of what he calls lax federal oversight of the oil drilling industry, and in late 2010 launched an investigation of the White House&#x27;s handling of the Horizon spill and its aftermath. That investigation revealed that scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and elsewhere in the federal government had voiced concerns about drafts of an official government report on the cause and scope of the spill, but were overruled because the report was meant as a &quot;communications document&quot;.

In 2010, Grijalva introduced H.R. 5355 to eliminate the cap on oil company liability for the cost of environmental cleanups of spills.

===Education===
Grijalva has sponsored numerous education bills, including the Success in the Middle Act and the Graduation for All Act. He has longstanding ties to the educational community from his time on the board of the Tucson Unified School District and his current position on the House Education and the Workforce Committee.

===Environment===
As a member and chair of the Pima County Board of Supervisors, Grijalva was widely regarded as a central figure behind the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, an ambitious county program for planned land-use and biodiversity conservation. He consistently supported endangered species and wilderness conservation on the Board of Supervisors and has continued to do so in Congress, introducing a bill in 2009 to make permanent the National Landscape Conservation System within the Bureau of Land Management. In 2008, Grijalva released a report, &quot;The Bush Administration&#x27;s Assaults on Our National Parks, Forests and Public Lands&quot;, that accused the Bush administration of mismanaging public land and reducing barriers to commercial access.

The Trump administration proposed changes to &quot;the way it enforces the Endangered Species Act&quot; in 2018. Among other things, the proposal would facilitate delisting endangered species and &quot;streamline interagency consultations&quot;. A ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee at the time, Grijalva called the proposal &quot;a favor to industry&quot; and said the administration &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to know any other way to handle the environment&quot; than &quot;as an obstacle to industry profits&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
In 2011, Grijalva and representatives Barbara Lee, Mike Honda, and Lynn Woolsey criticized Obama for failing to seek congressional authorization for military intervention in Libya, and was one of the 70 Democrats to vote to defund the Libyan war. In 2013, he opposed intervening in Syria.

On April 25, 2018, 57 U.S. representatives, including Grijalva, released a condemnation of Holocaust distortion in Poland and Ukraine. They criticized Poland&#x27;s new Holocaust law, which would criminalize accusing Poland of complicity in the Holocaust, and Ukraine&#x27;s 2015 memory laws glorifying Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and its leaders, such as Roman Shukhevych.

In July 2019, Grijalva voted against a House resolution condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed 398–17.

In 2021, Grijalva was one of eight Democrats to vote against the funding of the Iron Dome in Israel.

===Fossil fuel industry funding of climate change studies===
On February 24, 2015, as the ranking Democratic member of the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, Grijalva sent letters to seven institutions employing scientists who disagree with most other climate scientists on manmade climate change. The letters requested information on any funding from fossil fuel companies as well as copies of all emails about the content of their congressional testimony. One of the recipients, University of Colorado Professor Roger Pielke Jr., responded that he had already testified to Grijalva&#x27;s committee that he has received no funding from fossil fuel interests, and characterized the letter as part of a politically motivated &quot;witch-hunt&quot;.

The heads of some mainstream scientific organizations criticized Grijalva&#x27;s letters. Margaret Leinen, the president of the American Geophysical Union, posted on her AGU blog that in requiring information of only a few scientists, based only on their scientific views, Grivalja&#x27;s action was contrary to academic freedom: &quot;We view the singling out of any individual or group of scientists by any entity – governmental, corporate or other – based solely on their interpretations of scientific research as a threat to that freedom.&quot; The executive director of the American Meteorological Society wrote to Grijalva that his action &quot;sends a chilling message to all academic researchers&quot; and &quot;impinges on the free pursuit of ideas that is central to the concept of academic freedom&quot;.

In response to criticism that requesting communications was counter to principles of academic freedom, Grijalva said he was willing to eliminate that part of the request.

===Gun control===
Grijalva supports increasing restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns and increasing enforcement of existing restrictions on gun purchase and possession. He was one of the 67 co-sponsors of the 2007 Assault Weapons Ban, HR 1022. Grijalva has an F rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.

=== Health care ===
As co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, Grijalva was a prominent supporter of a public option throughout the debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The House-approved Affordable Health Care for America Act included a public option, but the Senate version did not, and it was ultimately not a part of the final package. Grijalva has largely been supportive of the ACA since its passage and argued the Supreme Court should not overturn it during a segment with Representative Peter Roskam, who opposed the law, on the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; on March 28, 2012.

Grijalva has a long history in community health activism as an early supporter of Tucson&#x27;s El Rio Community Health Center. He supports single-payer health care, but voted for the ACA because he felt it was a major improvement over the status quo.

=== Immigration ===
Grijalva supports the DREAM Act and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America&#x27;s Security and Prosperity Act (CIR ASAP) and has come to prominence because of his role in promoting immigration reform. He opposed the expansion of a border fence, citing cost effectiveness concerns and potential damage to sensitive wildlife habitats. The CIR ASAP bill includes his Border Security and Responsibility Act of 2009, which prioritizes remote cameras and other border monitoring techniques with a relatively slight environmental impact. The Immigrant Justice Advocacy Campaign gave him a 100% score for the first session of the 111th Congress. In previous years he voted against H.R. 4437 and the Secure Fence Act, and opposed Arizona Proposition 200 in 2004.

Grijalva has criticized armed civilian groups that patrol the Mexican border, accusing them of racism, and has reportedly used demeaning language to describe them. In return, some supporters of the armed patrols have called him &quot;MEChA boy&quot; in retaliation.

On July 26, 2019, Grijalva, whose district runs along the U.S.–Mexico border, called Trump&#x27;s emergency declaration a &quot;pathetic attempt to circumvent Congress&quot;.

===Israel===
Grijalva voted to support Israel following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

=== Native Americans ===
When elected in 2002, Grijalva&#x27;s seventh Congressional district included seven sovereign Native American tribes: the Tohono O’odham Nation, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Gila River Indian Community, Ak-Chin Indian Community, Cocopah Tribe, Colorado River Indian Tribes and the Quechan Tribe. After the redistricting based on the 2020 census, the seventh district includes the Tohono O’odham Nation, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Cocopah Tribe, and Quechan Tribe. Grijalva supports the sovereignty of Native American governments and advocates for a strong government-to-government relationship between Tribal Nations and the United States. He believes that Tribal Nations should receive the respect and authority they deserve in managing their lands and protecting their sacred and cultural sites. 

In April 2010, Grijalva introduced the &quot;Requirements, Expectations, and Standard Procedures in Effective Consultation with Tribes Act,&quot; known as the RESPECT Act, which ultimately did not pass into law. The bill aimed to establish into law a Clinton-era executive order that lacked the force of law. It would require the federal government to consult with tribal governments before initiating any proposed federal activities or finalizing regulatory actions that could impact tribal communities. Additionally, the Act mandated consultations for all activities that may affect federal land adjacent to Indian land.

=== SB 1070 and the boycott controversy ===
After the passage in April 2010 of Arizona&#x27;s controversial SB 1070 law, which Grijalva saw as opening the door to racial profiling and granting traditionally federal immigration enforcement powers to local authorities, he suggested that civic, religious, labor, Latino, and other like-minded organizations refrain from using Arizona as a convention site until the law was repealed. His opposition to SB 1070 and his suggestion of a boycott of Arizona were widely viewed as the reason for multiple subsequent death threats against him and his staff, which led to several office closures in 2010.

When Judge Susan Bolton of the Arizona District Court enjoined major parts of the law in July 2010, Grijalva ended his call for economic sanctions. As he told the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot;, the largest paper in Tucson:

He subsequently said that his economic strategy was not as effective as he hoped in changing other state lawmakers&#x27; minds, and that he would focus on legal remedies in the future. The issue became a focal point in the 2010 election, in which Grijalva defeated Republican challenger Ruth McClung by less than 10,000 votes.

=== Presidential election objections ===
Concerned about allegations of voting irregularities purportedly leading to disenfranchisement, in 2004 Grijalva joined Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson and several other House Democrats in requesting that the United Nations observe and certify elections in the United States. After the general election, Grijalva was one of 31 representatives to vote not to count Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes. President George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Grijalva objected to North Carolina&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2016 presidential election, which Donald Trump won by over 150,000 votes. Because no senator joined his objection, it was dismissed.

=== Giffords shooting ===

After the shooting of Gabby Giffords, Grijalva called it a consequence of the violent rhetoric that had been used by Tea Party members. He singled out Sarah Palin&#x27;s rhetoric as &quot;contributing to this toxic climate&quot; and said she needed to monitor her words and actions.

=== Puerto Rico statehood ===
In June 2023, Raul Grijalva traveled to Puerto Rico to discuss the prospects for statehood and energy issues in Puerto Rico with Governor of Puerto Rico Pedro Pierluisi.

=== Biden 2024 campaign ===
On July 3, 2024, Grijalva became the second House Democrat to publicly call for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.

==Political campaigns==
After the 2000 United States census, Arizona gained two congressional districts. The 2nd district, which had long been represented by Mo Udall, was renumbered as the 7th district. Ed Pastor, a Phoenix Democrat who succeeded Udall in 1991, had his home drawn into the newly created 4th district and opted to run for election there, making the 7th district an open seat. Grijalva won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, which was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. Before the 2010 election, he was reelected three times with no substantial Republican opposition. In 2008, he defeated Republican challenger Joseph Sweeney.

During the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Grijalva endorsed Obama for president, but Hillary Clinton won his district.

During the 2010 midterms, Grijalva faced his toughest reelection campaign yet, against Republican Ruth McClung. It was reported that although Grijalva had decades of experience and McClung had none, and although there were twice as many Democrats in the district as there were Republicans, the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls. The main reason was Grijalva&#x27;s call for a boycott of Arizona in response to the state&#x27;s new immigration law, SB 1070. Grijalva won, 50–44%, his smallest margin of victory since being elected, and the first close election in what is now the 7th since 1978, when Udall was held to 52% of the vote.

Grijalva&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 3rd district after the 2010 census, and made somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor even though it lost some of its share of Tucson to the 2nd district (the reconfigured 8th). Co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Grijalva broke from many of his colleagues and announced his support for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on October 9, 2015, at a rally for Sanders in Tucson.

==Electoral history==


==Personal life==
Grijalva and his wife, Ramona, have three daughters, including Tucson Unified School District board member Adelita Grijalva, who was reelected to the post in 2018. Grijalva identifies as Catholic.

Grijalva is a hiker and a fan of the University of Arizona&#x27;s basketball team.

On April 2, 2024, Grijalva announced that he had been diagnosed with unspecified cancer initially diagnosed as pneumonia, and was beginning a &quot;vigorous course of treatment&quot;.

<text>IEEE 802.20 or Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) was a specification by the standard association of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for mobile broadband networks. The main standard was published in 2008. MBWA is no longer being actively developed.

This wireless broadband technology is also known and promoted as iBurst (or HC-SDMA, High Capacity Spatial Division Multiple Access). It was originally developed by ArrayComm and optimizes the use of its bandwidth with the help of smart antennas. Kyocera is the manufacturer of iBurst devices.

== Description ==
iBurst is a mobile broadband wireless access system that was first developed by ArrayComm, and announced with partner Sony in April 2000.
It was adopted as the High Capacity – Spatial Division Multiple Access (HC-SDMA) radio interface standard (ATIS-0700004-2005) by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS).
The standard was prepared by ATIS’ Wireless Technology and Systems Committee&#x27;s Wireless Wideband Internet Access subcommittee and accepted as an American National Standard in 2005.

HC-SDMA was announced as considered by ISO TC204 WG16 for the continuous communications standards architecture, known as Communications, Air-interface, Long and Medium range (CALM), which ISO is developing for intelligent transport systems (ITS). ITS may include applications for public safety, network congestion management during traffic incidents, automatic toll booths, and more. An official liaison was established between WTSC and ISO TC204 WG16 for this in 2005.

The HC-SDMA interface provides wide-area broadband wireless data-connectivity for fixed, portable and mobile computing devices and appliances. The protocol is designed to be implemented with smart antenna array techniques (called MIMO for multiple-input multiple-output) to substantially improve the radio frequency (RF) coverage, capacity and performance for the system.
In January 2006, the IEEE 802.20 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Working Group adopted a technology proposal that included the use of the HC-SDMA standard for the 625kHz Multi-Carrier time-division duplex (TDD) mode of the standard. One Canadian vendor operates at 1.8 GHz.

== Technical description ==
The HC-SDMA interface operates on a similar premise as cellular phones, with hand-offs between HC-SDMA cells repeatedly providing the user with a seamless wireless Internet access even when moving at the speed of a car or train.

The standard&#x27;s proposed benefits:
*IP roaming &amp; handoff (at more than 1 Mbit/s)
*New MAC and PHY with IP and adaptive antennas
*Optimized for full mobility up to vehicular speeds of 250 km/h
*Operates in Licensed Bands (below 3.5 GHz)
*Uses Packet Architecture
*Low Latency

Some technical details were:
*Bandwidths of 5, 10, and 20 MHz.
*Peak data rates of 80 Mbit/s.
*Spectral efficiency above 1 bit/sec/Hz using multiple input/multiple output technology (MIMO).
*Layered frequency hopping allocates OFDM carriers to near, middle, and far-away handsets, improving SNR (works best for SISO handsets.)
*Supports low-bit rates efficiently, carrying up to 100 phone calls per MHz.
*Hybrid ARQ with up to 6 transmissions and several choices for interleaving.
*Basic slot period of 913 microseconds carrying 8 OFDM symbols.
*One of the first standards to support both TDM (FL, RL) and separate-frequency (FL, RL) deployments.

The protocol:
* specifies base station and client device RF characteristics, including output power levels, transmit frequencies and timing error, pulse shaping, in-band and out-of band spurious emissions, receiver sensitivity and selectivity;
* defines associated frame structures for the various burst types including standard uplink and downlink traffic, paging and broadcast burst types;
* specifies the modulation, forward error correction, interleaving and scrambling for various burst types;
* describes the various logical channels (broadcast, paging, random access, configuration and traffic channels) and their roles in establishing communication over the radio link; and
* specifies procedures for error recovery and retry.
The protocol also supports Layer 3 (L3) mechanisms for creating and controlling logical connections (sessions) between client device and base including registration, stream start, power control, handover, link adaptation, and stream closure, as well as L3 mechanisms for client device authentication and secure transmission on the data links.
Currently deployed iBurst systems allow connectivity up to 2 Mbit/s for each subscriber equipment. Apparently there will be future firmware upgrade possibilities to increase these speeds up to 5 Mbit/s, consistent with HC-SDMA protocol.

== History ==
The 802.20 working group was proposed in response to products using technology originally developed by ArrayComm marketed under the iBurst brand name. The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions adopted iBurst as ATIS-0700004-2005.
The Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) Working Group was approved by IEEE Standards Board on December 11, 2002, to prepare a formal specification for a packet-based air interface designed for Internet Protocol-based services. 
At its height, the group had 175 participants.

On June 8, 2006, the IEEE-SA Standards Board directed that all activities of the 802.20 Working Group be temporarily suspended until October 1, 2006.
The decision came from complaints of a lack of transparency, and that the group&#x27;s chair, Jerry Upton, was favoring Qualcomm.
The unprecedented step came after other working groups had also been subject to related allegations of large companies undermining the standard process.
Intel and Motorola had filed appeals, claiming they were not given time to prepare proposals.
These claims were cited in a 2007 lawsuit filed by Broadcom against Qualcomm.

On September 15, 2006, the IEEE-SA Standards Board approved a plan to enable the working group to move towards completion and approval by reorganizing.
The chair at the November 2006 meeting was Arnold Greenspan.
On July 17, 2007, the IEEE 802 Executive Committee along with its 802.20 Oversight Committee approved a change to voting in the 802.20 working group. Instead of a vote per attending individual, each entity would have a single vote.
On June 12, 2008, the IEEE approved the base standard to be published.
Additional supporting standards included IEEE 802.20.2-2010, a protocol conformance statement, 802.20.3-2010, minimum performance characteristics, an amendment 802.20a-2010 for a Management Information Base and some corrections, and amendment 802.20b-2010 to support bridging.

802.20 standard was put to hibernation in March 2011 due to lack of activity.

In 2004 another wireless standard group had been formed as IEEE 802.22, for wireless regional networks using unused television station frequencies.
Trials such as those in the Netherlands by T-Mobile International in 2004 were announced as &quot;Pre-standard 802.20&quot;. These were based on an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing technology known as FLASH-OFDM developed by Flarion (since 2006 owned by Qualcomm).
However, other service providers soon adopted 802.16e (the mobile version of WiMAX).

In September 2008, the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses in Japan adopted the 802.20-2008 standard as ARIB STD-T97.
Kyocera markets products supporting the standard under the iBurst name. , Kyocera claimed 15 operators offered service in 12 countries.

== Commercial use ==
Various options are already commercially available using:
* Desktop modem with USB and Ethernet ports (with external power supply)
* Portable USB modem (using USB power supply)
* Laptop modem (PC card)
* Wireless Residential Gateway
* Mobile Broadband Router

iBurst was commercially available in twelve countries in 2011 including Azerbaijan, Lebanon, and United States.

iBurst (Pty) Ltd started operation in South Africa in 2005.

iBurst Africa International provided the service in Ghana in 2007, and then later in Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya.

MoBif Wireless Broadband Sdn Bhd, started service in Malaysia in 2007, changing its name to iZZinet. The provider ceased operations in March 2011.

In Australia, Veritel and Personal Broadband Australia (a subsidiary of Commander Australia Limited), offered iBurst services however both have since been shut down after the increase of 3.5G and 4G mobile data services. BigAir acquired Veritel&#x27;s iBurst customers in 2006, and shut down the service in 2009.
Personal Broadband Australia&#x27;s iBurst service was shut down in December 2008.

iBurst South Africa officially shut down on August 31, 2017. Users were given a choice to keep their @iburst.co.za or @wbs.co.za. iBurst still keeps support staff available, however this is also expected to be shut down by the end of 2017 (no information about support remaining for the email addresses from iBurst has been given).

<text>Vila is a site at the southern end of Kolombangara in the nation of Solomon Islands, originally the location of the Vila Stanmore coconut plantation.

During World War II, Japanese forces built an airstrip in order to stage aircraft from Rabaul down to Guadalcanal, and on several occasions, beginning on 24 January 1943 the US attempted to put the airstrip out of operation by bombing it. However, it remained in use until the Japanese evacuated Kolombangara in September and early October 1943.

The airstrip survives today, and is occasionally visited by tourists interested in its history.

<text>Antoine Brumel (c. 1460 – 1512 or 1513) was a French composer. He was one of the first renowned French members of the Franco-Flemish school of the Renaissance, and, after Josquin des Prez, was one of the most influential composers of his generation.

==Life==
Little is known about his early life, but he was probably born west of Chartres, perhaps in the town of Brunelles, near to Nogent-le-Rotrou, making him one of the first of the Netherlandish composers who was actually French. He sang at Notre-Dame de Chartres from 9 August 1483 until 1486, and subsequently held posts at St Peter&#x27;s in Geneva (until 1492) and Laon (around 1497) before becoming choirmaster to the boys at Notre-Dame de Paris from 1498 to 1500, and choirmaster to Alfonso I d&#x27;Este at Ferrara from 1506, replacing the famous composer Jacob Obrecht who had died of the plague there the previous year. The chapel there was disbanded in 1510, after which he evidently stayed in Italy; several documents connect him with churches in Faenza and Mantua, where he probably died in 1512 or shortly after. He is known to have written at least one work after his dismissal from Ferrara (the &quot;Missa de beata virgine&quot;), and he may still have been alive in 1513 since there is a mention in a treatise of Vincenzo Galilei that Brumel was one of a group of composers who met with Pope Leo X in that year; however since Vincenzo was writing more than a generation later and reporting second-hand, and no other corroborating evidence has been found, this account is not considered to be certain. Then again, Heinrich Glarean, writing later about Brumel, indicated that he lived to a &quot;ripe old age&quot;, so it remains possible that he lived longer, but records have not survived.

A Jachet Brumel was organist for the Ferrara court in 1543, and is presumed to be Antoine&#x27;s son.

==Music==
Brumel was at the center of the changes that were taking place in European music around 1500, in which the previous style of highly differentiated voice parts, composed one after another, was giving way to smoothly flowing, equal parts, composed simultaneously. These changes can be seen in his music, with some of his earlier work conforming to the older style, and his later compositions showing the polyphonic fluidity which became the stylistic norm of the Josquin generation.

===Masses===
Brumel is best known for his masses, the most famous of which is the twelve-voice &quot;Missa Et ecce terræ motus&quot;. Techniques of composition varied throughout his life: he sometimes used the cantus firmus technique, already archaic by the end of the 15th century, and also the paraphrase technique, in which the source material appears elaborated, and in other voices than the tenor, often in imitation. He used paired imitation, like Josquin, but often in a freer manner than the more famous composer. A relatively unusual technique he used in an untitled mass was to use different source material for each of the sections (mass titles are taken from the pre-existing composition used as their basis: usually a plainchant, motet or chanson: hence the mass is without title). Brumel wrote a &quot;Missa l&#x27;homme armé&quot;, as did so many other composers of the Renaissance: appropriately, he set it as a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; mass, with the popular song in long notes in the tenor, to make it easier to hear. All of his masses, with the exception of the highly unusual twelve-voice &quot;Missa Et ecce terræ motus&quot;, are for four voices.

During the 16th century the most famous of Brumel&#x27;s masses was his &quot;Missa de beata virgine&quot;, a paraphrase mass using elaborations of various plainchant melodies. According to Heinrich Glarean, writing in 1547, it was written in competition with Josquin, who simultaneously wrote his own &quot;Missa de Beata Virgine&quot;, and the two works are similar in style.

Brumel&#x27;s &quot;Missa pro defunctis&quot; for four voices, a late work, is notable for being the first polyphonic requiem setting to include the &quot;Dies Irae&quot;. Brumel&#x27;s setting uses alternatim polyphony (sections of plainchant alternate with sections in polyphony). In addition, this is one of the earliest polyphonic requiems to survive: only Johannes Ockeghem&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; is earlier.

===Motets, chansons, and instrumental music===

Brumel also wrote numerous motets, chansons, and some instrumental music. His style in these also evolved throughout his life, with his earlier works showing the irregular lines and rhythmic complexity of the Ockeghem generation, while the later ones used the smooth imitative polyphony of the Josquin style as well as the homophonic textures of the current Italian composers of popular songs (for example Tromboncino, who was in Ferrara at the same time as Brumel). One peculiar feature of Brumel&#x27;s style is that sometimes he uses very quick syllabic declamation in chordal writing, anticipating the madrigalian fashion of later in the 16th century. This appears sometimes in the &quot;Credo&quot; sections of his masses – logically, since that section has the longest text, and if set similarly to the other sections to the mass, it can be disproportionately long.

After Josquin des Prez, Brumel is considered one of the greatest composers of his generation. During his life, Ottaviano Petrucci published a book of his masses, and a number of other composers wrote pieces commemorating him after his death. His impressive 12-voice &quot;Missa et ecce terræ motus&quot; survives from a part-book in Munich of 1570, long after his death, evidently used for performances by Lassus.

<text>Robert Marion Berry (August 27, 1942 – May 19, 2023) was an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2011. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life, family and education==
Born in Stuttgart, Arkansas, Berry was raised in nearby Bayou Meto, Arkansas County in the Arkansas Delta. The son of a rice farmer, he was encouraged by his parents to work towards a career outside the farm. Moving to Little Rock, he earned a pharmacy degree at the University of Arkansas and then ran a pharmacy for two years.

==Career==
In 1967, Berry returned to the family business and became a farmer, harvesting soybeans and rice, establishing a business that he carried on until his death in 2023. The family farm holdings have a reported net worth in excess of $1 million.

Berry was elected to a position as a city alderman in Gillett, Arkansas, in 1976. He was appointed a member of the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission by Governor Bill Clinton in 1986, and continued in that role until 1994. In 1993, then US President Bill Clinton went on to appoint Berry as a member of the White House Domestic Policy Council (1993–1996) and special assistant to the President for Agricultural Trade and Food Assistance (1993–1996).

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development
**Subcommittee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
*Committee on the Budget

===Caucuses===
*House Democratic Health Care Task Force (Co-Chair)
*House Affordable Medicine Task Force (Co-Chair)
*Congressional Soybean Caucus (Co-Chair)
*New Madrid Working Group (Co-Chair)

Berry was appointed to the House Appropriations Committee and served on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and Transportation subcommittees. He was also chosen by Democratic Leadership to serve as Vice-Chair of the Steering and Policy Committees of the United States House of Representatives and as a member of the Leader&#x27;s Senior Whip Team.

Berry was a self-described Blue Dog Democrat, and voted against the 2001 tax cuts.

Berry had a seat on the House Appropriations Committee. He co-founded the Democrats&#x27; Prescription Drug Task Force and pursued his interests in health care policy while in the Congress. As one of the three House Democrats that sat on the House–Senate conference committee on the Medicare/prescription drug bill in 2003, he voiced many complaints about the administration&#x27;s healthcare policies. Berry voted for the Democratic health care reform bill, HR 3962, during its first House floor vote. He also voted for the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Berry visited Cuba with Blanche Lincoln to promote the removal of the trade embargo to create more markets for Arkansas agricultural products. He drew some controversy when he supported the dumping of nuclear waste from Entergy Corporation reactors into the Arkansas River. Berry also made headlines when he called Rep. Adam Putnam (R-Florida) a &quot;Howdy Doody looking nimrod&quot; while on the House floor.

On October 10, 2002, Marion Berry was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

Berry was the only Democrat to vote against the GIVE Act, an act which could expand the AmeriCorps program.

On March 21, 2010, Berry joined 33 other Democrats and 178 Republicans and voted no on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Berry was one of four Democrats to vote against the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, joining 155 of 159 Republicans, blocking the vote (which needed a 2/3 majority to pass, as it was brought to vote under a motion to suspend rules).

==Political campaigns==
Returning to Arkansas in 1996, Berry announced his intention to run for the 1st District seat being vacated by Blanche Lincoln. With tough opposition from more progressive candidates, Berry narrowly won the primary with 52% of the vote, thanks to aggressive campaigning in the rural areas north of the Mississippi Delta region. In a district that had up to that time never elected a Republican, and with Berry outspending his opponent two-to-one in the general election, attorney Warren Dupwe, he claimed a modest victory (53%–44%) that November. He declined to run for statewide office, citing health, family responsibilities, and unspecified social issues. However, he enjoyed easy re-election from 1996 on, carrying the district 67%–33% in 2004, and then running unopposed in 2008, while receiving support from donors and groups also opposing the Barack Obama presidential campaign that year. He decided not to stand for re-election in 2010.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, like most Arkansas Democrats, Berry endorsed U.S. Senator and former First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Clinton for President.

==Personal life and death==
Berry resided in Gillett, Arkansas, with his wife Carolyn. He identified as a Methodist.

Berry died in Little Rock on May 19, 2023, at age 80.

Boozman was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, where his father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force, but the family eventually returned to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he was raised. He is the brother of the late state senator Fay Boozman. He attended the University of Arkansas, where he played football for the Arkansas Razorbacks, and later graduated from the Southern College of Optometry. He co-founded a private optometry clinic in 1977 and worked as a volunteer optometrist for low-income families. He won a special election in 2001 to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served as assistant majority whip and sat on the Republican Policy Committee. He was an advocate for drug policy issues and chaired the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, where he led the passage of bills expanding services for unemployed veterans.

Boozman was elected to the United States Senate in 2010, defeating Democratic incumbent Blanche Lincoln by a 21-point margin and becoming only the second Republican to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Arkansas since Reconstruction. He took office in January 2011 and is the ranking Republican on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade and the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies. He is also a senior member of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs. Boozman became the senior senator from Arkansas in 2015 when Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor left the Senate after his defeat by Tom Cotton. Boozman was reelected in 2016 and 2022.

==Early life, education and career==
Boozman was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Marie E. ( Nichols) and Fay Winford Boozman, Jr. (1923–1991). Boozman&#x27;s father, whose last address was in Rogers, Arkansas, was a Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. His elder brother, Fay Boozman (1946–2005), was also a politician. After graduating from Northside High School in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Boozman played football for the Arkansas Razorbacks at the University of Arkansas, which he attended from 1969 to 1973, while completing his pre-optometry requirements. He did not graduate from the University of Arkansas. He graduated from the Southern College of Optometry in 1977 and entered private practice that same year as co-founder of BoozmanHof Regional Eye Clinic in Rogers, which has become a major provider of eye care to Northwest Arkansas. He established the low vision program at the Arkansas School for the Blind in Little Rock and worked as a volunteer optometrist at an area clinic that provides medical services to low-income families.

Before his election to Congress, Boozman served two terms on the Rogers Public School Board, which governs one of Arkansas&#x27;s largest school districts.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Boozman was elected to Congress in a special election after his predecessor, Asa Hutchinson, resigned to become the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Boozman was unopposed in 2002, defeated Democratic State Representative Jan Judy 59%-38% in 2004, and defeated Democratic nominee Woodrow Anderson III in 2006. The Democrats did not field a candidate against him in 2008, and he won with over 78% of the vote against token opposition from a Green Party candidate.

===Tenure===
In October 2002, Boozman voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution that led to the Iraq War. In 2011, after 4,500 Americans and hundreds of thousands of civilians had died, he said: &quot;Right now, Iraq has a stable police force, a stable military. And hopefully that will continue, and they’ll be successful in having a form of democracy that is not a safe haven for terrorism in the future.”

Starting during the 108th Congress, Boozman served as an Assistant Whip, making him responsible for helping House Republican Whips Roy Blunt and Eric Cantor secure the votes for or against major legislation.

Boozman was also named to the Speaker&#x27;s Task Force for a Drug-Free America in 2003. The task force advised House Speaker Dennis Hastert on major drug policy issues and helped author legislation regarding recreational drugs, including anti-methamphetamine legislation. Boozman was the lead author of the Stop Marketing Illegal Drugs to Minors Act, a bill that would increase penalties on criminals who design and market drugs such as candy-flavored meth for kids. He was praised by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, earning the organization&#x27;s Congressional Leadership Award in 2009. In 2006, Congress passed a Boozman-authored provision promoting an expanded role for drug courts in efforts to reduce drug abuse and recidivism.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Boozman endorsed former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee for president.

In the 109th Congress, Boozman chaired the Veterans Affairs Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, which focuses on ensuring veterans have a smooth transition to civilian life. He has used his seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee to pass legislation honoring the service and sacrifice of United States military veterans and increasing benefits to them and their families. In the 111th Congress, Boozman introduced and the House of Representatives passed the Veterans Retraining Act of 2009, which provides resources and training opportunities for unemployed veterans. The House also passed several other Boozman-authored bills, including one that creates grants to help disabled veterans adapt their homes and vehicles to meet their needs.

In May 2004, Boozman was appointed to the House Policy Committee, a committee of Republicans who vet issues and formulate legislation to address them.

Boozman was also a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Assembly (NATO PA), an inter-parliamentary organization of legislators from the 19 member countries of NATO and 20 associate countries. He was also appointed vice-chairman of the British American Parliamentary Group, a group of American and British lawmakers who meet to discuss issues of concern and fortify the already strong alliance between the two nations.

Boozman was a member of numerous House caucuses, including the Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamine, the National Guard and Reserve Components Caucus, the Congressional Rural Caucus and the Congressional Sportsman&#x27;s Caucus. He was also one of the founding members of the Congressional I-49 Caucus to promote completion of Interstate 49, and chaired the Congressional Caucus on the Ivory Coast and West Africa Caucus.

Congress.org&#x27;s power rankings rated Boozman&#x27;s power rating at 7.31, making him the 386th most powerful member out of 435.

According to the April 28, 2007, &quot;Washington Post,&quot; Boozman was told by officials in the White House about its intention to fire Bud Cummins, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and replace him with Tim Griffin, an aide to Karl Rove. According to the &quot;Post,&quot; none of the Democrats in Arkansas&#x27; congressional delegation were told that Cummins was to be one of eight U.S. Attorneys to be fired. Although Boozman did not represent any counties in the Eastern District, he was informed because he was the only Republican in the state&#x27;s congressional delegation.

Boozman told the &quot;Post&quot; and the Associated Press that White House officials had promised him that Griffin would be subject to Senate confirmation. Instead, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appointed Griffin as interim U.S. Attorney, using a provision of the Patriot Act that has since been repealed due to the controversy. Boozman also said that he did not think Cummins should have been fired because he was &quot;very well respected and has served the president well.&quot;

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
====2010====

In 2010, Boozman did not run for reelection to the House and instead ran for the Senate seat held by incumbent two-term Democrat Blanche Lincoln, who had defeated Boozman&#x27;s brother, Fay, in her first run for the seat in 1998. He won the May 2010 Republican primary and defeated Lincoln in the general election with nearly 58% of the vote.

====2016====

Boozman won a second term in 2016, defeating former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge with 59.8% of the vote. He became the first Republican to be popularly elected to a second term in the Senate from Arkansas.

====2022====
On March 6, 2021, Boozman announced he would seek a third term as Senator. He won his third term in 2022, defeating Democrat Natalie James with 65.8% of the vote.

===Term===
Boozman began his term in the Senate in January 2011.

Boozman and Tom Cotton initially objected to the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count. After the 2021 United States Capitol attack, they voted to support it. Boozman said: &quot;The events that transpired in Washington were not only shocking and unlawful, but represent a dark moment in our country&#x27;s history that we must reckon with today and in the days to come.&quot;

In 2024, Boozman led a bipartisan Congressional delegation to France to honor the 80th anniversary of D-Day.

The Zionist Organization of America has praised Boozman for his opposition to federal aid to Hamas.

Boozman received an 85.48% Lifetime Score from the American Conservative Union.

===Abortion===
Boozman opposes abortion. After &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; in June 2022, he wrote: &quot;The Supreme Court’s decision to affirm there is no constitutional right to indiscriminately sacrifice the lives of children in their mothers&#x27; wombs is the culmination of decades of work to correct the tragic, deadly lie that unborn babies are expendable and undeserving of protection.&quot;

===Arkansas history===
Boozman introduced legislation in the 110th Congress calling for a study of the historic Butterfield Overland Mail Trail for the potential addition to the National Trails System. This legislation passed as part of an omnibus bill (P.L. 111-11), and was signed by Obama on March 30, 2009.

In addition to preserving the historical significance of the Butterfield Trail, Boozman supported an effort to secure the home of the U.S. Marshals Museum in Fort Smith; in January 2007, it was announced that Fort Smith would be the museum&#x27;s permanent home. In the 111th Congress, Boozman introduced legislation to recognize the 225th Anniversary of the U.S. Marshals Service with a commemorative coin to be minted in 2014.

Boozman has penned three bills, each enacted into law, to name certain U.S. Post Offices in Arkansas, including naming The Harrison Post Office after former Arkansas Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt.

===Health care reform===
Boozman voted against the Affordable Care Act on November 7, 2009, later writing: &quot;I am for health care reform, unfortunately, this bill does more harm than good.&quot;

=== Donald Trump ===
Boozman supported Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. He voted with Trump&#x27;s stated position 91.5% of the time, and voted to acquit Trump in both of his impeachment trials.

===Gun violence and firearm laws===
Boozman has an A rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund for his support of gun rights. In May 2011, he voted to table an amendment that prohibited usage of the Patriot Act to access firearm records. In April 2013, in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Boozman was one of 46 senators to vote against a bill that would have extended background checks to all firearm transfers. He voted with 40 Republicans and five Democrats to stop the bill.

Boozman voted against the proposed Feinstein Amendment, in 2016, that sought to ban the sale of firearms to known and/or suspected terrorists, claiming that it would deprive Americans of due process.

===Employment discrimination===
In November 2013, Boozman was one of 32 senators (all Republican) to vote against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill prohibiting discrimination in organizations of 15 or more employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In April 2014, Boozman voted against a cloture motion for the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that establishes additional penalties for violations of equal pay requirements in the Fair Labor Standards Act, including a prohibition on an employer from paying a wage rate to employees of a particular sex that is lower than the rate paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work unless such payment is made due to certain factors including but not limited to &quot;a bona fide factor other than sex&quot;. Some groups characterized the legislation as redundant, citing the 1963 Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as existing protections against wage discrimination based on gender or race. The Senate Republican Conference called it &quot;the latest ploy in the Democrats&#x27; election-year playbook&quot;.

===Civil rights===
In September 2004, Boozman voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The amendment did not pass.

In July 2006, Boozman co-introduced and voted for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. The amendment did not pass.

In April 2009, Boozman voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which sought to define crimes committed against a person because of their sexual orientation or gender identity as hate crimes: &quot;I opposed this legislation because it creates a new federal offense for so-called hate crimes, and adds a special class crimes potentially motivated by the victims sexual orientation, &#x27;gender identity&#x27;, or the perceived thoughts of the alleged criminal.&quot; The act passed the House.

In December 2010, Boozman voted against repealing Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell, claiming that the &quot;current policy has worked well&quot; and that &quot;we haven&#x27;t had any significant problems with it.&quot; The vote passed by a margin of 250-175, and Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell was repealed.

In December 2012, Boozman voted against ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, an international human rights treaty of the United Nations intended to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sought to &quot;promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity,&quot; but the convention only reached 61 of the 66 votes required for passage.

In February 2013, Boozman voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. The bill passed by a 78–22 margin. He cited concerns &quot;about the constitutionality of allowing tribal courts jurisdiction over non-Native Americans who are accused of committing an act of domestic violence on tribal lands or against Native Americans” as part of his opposition to the measure.

===Veteran employment===
In September 2012, Boozman voted to block advancement of the Veterans Job Corps Act of 2012, even though he partially authored the bill. The bill, which would have established a $1 billion Veterans Jobs Corps at a time when the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans was 10.9%, fell two votes shy (58–40) of the 60 needed for passage. The legislation underwent changes related to how it would offset spending, which led Boozman to vote against it.

===Environment===
In 2017, Boozman was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Boozman has received nearly $150,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012. He claimed that EPA regulations are creating a dirtier climate abroad and providing no gain to the United States.

Boozman wrote: &quot;I commend President Trump for taking the appropriate steps to make a clean exit from it so we can continue to pursue an &#x27;all-of-the-above&#x27; approach to meeting our energy needs free of the significant litigation risk created by the agreement.&quot; He added: &quot;It is important to stress that a clean exit from the Paris climate accord will not take away the United States&#x27; seat at the table in future discussions, nor will it detract from our efforts to pursue renewable energy solutions.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
In March 2017, Boozman co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which made it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In January 2019, Boozman was one of eleven Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to block Trump&#x27;s intent to lift sanctions against three Russian companies.

=== January 6 commission ===
On May 28, 2021, Boozman voted against creating a January 6 commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

<doc id="408554" wikidata="Q715362" url="?curid=408554" title="Mike Ross (politician)">
<text>Michael Avery Ross (born August 2, 1961) is an American businessman and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2013 and was his party&#x27;s nominee for governor of Arkansas in 2014. He is currently the last Democrat to have represented Arkansas in the House of Representatives. He was also a member of the Arkansas Senate from 1991 to 2001, a member of the Nevada County Quorum Court from 1983 to 1985, and a small business owner.

On July 25, 2011, Ross announced that he would not seek reelection to the House in 2012. He instead became the Democratic nominee for governor of Arkansas in the general election scheduled for November 4, 2014. He faced the Republican nominee, former U.S. Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, who had previously lost the 2006 gubernatorial election to Democrat Mike Beebe. Ross lost to Hutchinson, ending his undefeated electoral streak.

Ross is an officer and senior vice president at Little Rock-based Southwest Power Pool, which manages the electric grid and operates the wholesale electric market for all or parts of 14 states.

==Early life, education, and career==

Ross was born in Texarkana, Arkansas. A fifth-generation Arkansan, he lived for many years in Prescott until relocating in 2013 to the capital city of Little Rock. The grandson of farmers and a nurse and the son of two public school educators, he graduated from high school in Hope, Arkansas and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, working his way through college as a local radio announcer.

Along with his wife Holly (divorced 2021), who is a pharmacist, they owned and operated a pharmacy and home medical equipment business in his hometown of Prescott, from 1993 until they sold it in 2007.

By the age of 20, Ross was driving and staffing then former governor Bill Clinton as he successfully waged his &quot;come back&quot; campaign for a second term as Governor of Arkansas. During the 1980s, Ross was also vice president for colleges for the Young Democrats of Arkansas and served for many years on the Democratic Party of Arkansas&#x27;s state committee and its executive committee.

Ross previously served on the Nevada County Quorum Court from 1983 to 1985 and as chief of staff to then-lieutenant governor Winston Bryant from 1985 to 1989.

Ross was a member of the Arkansas State Senate for ten years (1991–2001), before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Arkansas&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 2000. Ross left Congress on January 3, 2013, after choosing not to seek a seventh term and after a brief stint in the private sector as an officer and senior vice president at the Little Rock-based non-profit Southwest Power Pool, he announced his candidacy for Governor of Arkansas on April 17, 2013. After an unsuccessful bid for governor, he returned to Southwest Power Pool, a regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid and operates the wholesale electric market for all or part of 14 states, where he currently serves as an officer and senior Vice President.

==Arkansas State Senate==
In 1990, Ross was elected to the Arkansas State Senate becoming the legislature&#x27;s youngest member at that time, where he served as chair of the Senate Children and Youth Committee. During his tenure, Ross worked alongside future governor Mike Beebe to help pass the Arkansas Academic Challenge scholarship program.

Ross served in the state senate ten years, until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000.

==Political positions==

===Health care===
Ross has consistently voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. He was one of three Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to vote to repeal Obamacare and continued to vote to repeal the law throughout his tenure in Congress.

In a statement after his vote in January 2011, Mike Ross said: &quot;I have said from the beginning that I believe we absolutely need health care reform, but we need commonsense health care reform that reflects Arkansas values. This law was more than 2,000 pages, cut Medicare by half a trillion dollars, placed huge unfunded mandates on our states and authorized the IRS to fine people who can&#x27;t afford to buy health insurance. An overwhelming majority of my constituents continue to oppose this health care reform law and I believe we should repeal it, start over and listen to the majority of the American people—not the special interests and party leaders in Washington.&quot;

Ross supports Arkansas&#x27;s bipartisan Medicaid expansion known as the &quot;private option&quot; – the state&#x27;s plan to use federal Medicaid money to pay for private insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Ross said that &quot;although he voted against the Affordable Care Act, he supports the private option, which he called an &#x27;Arkansas-specific, bipartisan and market-based solution&#x27; that helps working families. Arkansas&#x27; private option is a great example of what we can accomplish when we listen to one another and work together in a bipartisan way, and, as governor, I will support the law and its continued funding.&quot;

===The Blue Dogs and health care===
On June 19, 2009, Ross made clear that he and a group of other fiscally conservative, moderate Democrats, known as the Blue Dog Coalition, were increasingly unhappy with the direction that health-care legislation was taking in the House. They claimed the health care reform bill was being written behind closed doors without their input and that the proposals being consider fall short in reducing costs and increasing efficiency, outlining only a fraction of what will be required to achieve a product that does not add to the deficit.

Ross was thrust into the national spotlight on July 21 when he and a group of seven Blue Dog Democrats on Energy &amp; Commerce bucked their party&#x27;s leaders and brought the committee mark up process of H.R. 3200, America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, to a halt. (This piece of legislation would eventually die and never receive a vote on the House floor. H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, is the House health care reform bill that would eventually be considered by the House of Representatives, and Ross voted against that bill.) House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman postponed meeting publicly to discuss the health-care legislation to negotiate with the Blue Dogs, meeting privately with Ross and other members of the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, conservative Democrats who sit on the committee and could join Republicans and vote down a bill they don&#x27;t like since the panel has 36 Democrats and 23 Republicans.

After days of back-to-back meetings and intense negotiations into the night, four of the seven Blue Dog Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Ross, said they resolved their differences with Chairman Henry Waxman of California and were able to force House leadership to agree on several provisions, namely that the full House would not vote on the legislation until at least September so lawmakers would have time to read the bill and listen to constituents.

Other concessions won by Blue Dogs, which drew immediate opposition from liberals in the chamber, would shave about 10 percent from the health care overhaul&#x27;s $1 trillion, 10-year price tag, in part by limiting subsidies to people who are not insured. The exemption for small businesses would be doubled so that only businesses with payrolls greater than $500,000 a year would be required to offer insurance or pay a tax equivalent to 8 percent of their payroll.

Because many Blue Dogs, especially Ross, had serious concerns about the bill&#x27;s potential harmful effects on rural doctors and rural hospitals, the group forced House leadership to accept that the government would negotiate rates with health care providers instead of using Medicare rates in any so-called public option.

However, some of the concessions to Ross set off a revolt among members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who said they feared that the public insurance plan was being weakened. &quot;We do not support this,&quot; said Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, co-chairwoman of the progressive caucus. &quot;It&#x27;s a nonstarter.&quot;

After Congress&#x27; August recess, Ross announced that he could not support a bill with a Public Option. In a letter to constituents, he claimed that &quot;An overwhelming number of you oppose a government-run health insurance option, and it is your feedback that has led me to oppose the public option as well.&quot; However, a Research 2000 poll, commissioned by the left-leaning group Daily Kos, found that a majority of his district actually supported a Public Option. While a poll from the University of Arkansas only found support for the public option at 39 percent. Ross ultimately voted against the health care reform bill that passed the House on November 7, 2009. In January 2011, Ross was one of three Democrats to vote with the unified Republican caucus for the repeal of the recent health care reform law.

===Other issues===
Ross co-sponsored and voted for the Federal Reserve Transparency Act to audit the Federal Reserve System.

Ross is against gun control and is one of the few Democratic members of Congress to consistently earn an A+ rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.

Throughout his time in the U.S. House of Representatives, Ross was consistently ranked as one of the most independent and moderate members of Congress by &quot;National Journal&quot;. When Ross left Congress in 2013, he was ranked as the sixth most conservative Democrat in the entire U.S. House of Representatives.

==Political campaigns==
Ross won a narrow victory against incumbent Republican Jay Dickey in 2000 by portraying himself as a moderate, like the political tendencies of his district. In contrast, Dickey was seen as controversial because of his comments on stem cell research and homosexuality. Additionally, he had voted to impeach Bill Clinton, which was a highly unpopular move in Clinton&#x27;s home district. Clinton, who had won the district by wide margins in both of his presidential bids, campaigned on behalf of Ross. Ross was the only Democratic House challenger outside of California to defeat a Republican incumbent in 2000.

Ross easily defeated Dickey in a 2002 rematch, then ran unopposed in 2004. He picked up an easy victory in the 2006 election, defeating the similarly named Republican, real estate executive Joe Ross, 75 percent–25 percent.

In terms of a possible ballot initiative in Arkansas to allow the use of doctor-prescribed medical marijuana, Ross&#x27; campaign said &quot;over the next several months, many issues will try to get on the 2014 ballot, and, like every other Arkansan, Mike Ross will carefully review each measure once it&#x27;s certified and placed on the ballot.&quot;

===2008===

Ross had no Republican opponent but did face Hot Springs lawyer and Green Party candidate Joshua Drake, whom he beat with a decisive 87% of the vote.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, like most Arkansas Democrats, Ross endorsed former U.S. Senator and former First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton (D-New York) for president.

===2010===

Winning 58% of the vote, Ross handily defeated Republican nominee Beth Anne Rankin (40%) and Green Party nominee Josh Drake (2%), despite that year&#x27;s Republican wave. Ross was the only U.S. House member from Arkansas who sought reelection in 2010, as Democrats Robert Marion Berry and Vic Snyder retired, while Republican John Boozman ran successfully for the U.S. Senate. Ross became the only Democrat in Arkansas&#x27; House Delegation, as all three open seats were won by Republicans.

===2014 gubernatorial campaign===

On July 25, 2011, Ross announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of 2012. As for possibly running for Governor of Arkansas in 2014, he said: &quot;Whether I run for Governor in 2014 is a decision I have not yet made and won&#x27;t make until sometime after my term in this Congress ends. But I do know if I was re-elected to the U.S. Congress next year, my term in the Congress would overlap with the Governor&#x27;s race. I believe it would be impossible to successfully run for Governor here at home, while effectively carrying out my congressional duties in Washington.&quot;

On May 14, 2012, Ross announced that he would not run for governor in 2014. Instead, he became senior vice president for government affairs and public relations at the Little Rock-based, nonprofit Southwest Power Pool.

However, Ross resigned his position as an officer and senior vice president with Southwest Power Pool on April 2, 2013, to &quot;pursue another opportunity in public service.&quot; Ross said he received numerous calls and e-mails from all over the state to reconsider his decision not to run for governor and on April 17, 2013, Ross formally announced his campaign for governor in his hometown of Prescott.

On April 29, 2013, Ross tweeted that he had raised more than half a million dollars in the first ten days of the campaign.

During his campaign for governor, Ross made access to quality pre-kindergarten education a centerpiece of his campaign, introducing a plan to make pre-kindergarten accessible to every 4-year-old in Arkansas by 2025.

Ross also made reducing domestic violence and child abuse priorities in his crime reduction plan, which included increased support for shelters, more investigative money for child abuse and more training of police officers in coping with domestic situations. One key initiative in Ross&#x27; plan would have changed the way police respond to domestic violence calls. Under Ross&#x27;s plan, Arkansas police would have been trained to screen victims for risk level by asking a series of research-based questions. If the victim was determined to be at high risk, police would have been required to inform her about the danger she is in, encourage her to seek help and connect her with key resources. Ross&#x27; plan also included the creation of a confidential address program to help survivors of sexual assault, rape, stalking or domestic violence keep their location secret from abusers; changing the law so it&#x27;s easier for domestic violence survivors to terminate a housing lease without penalty; and directing the state to publish a comprehensive report on domestic violence every two years.

Ross also proposed a major overhaul of the state&#x27;s personal income tax structure and said the plan would have to be phased in over time as allowed by the state&#x27;s finances. The total price tag of the restructuring would cost an estimated $574.5 million, according to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. Ross said his tax cut plan, when fully implemented, would cut income taxes by as much as $465 for incomes at $30,000; $665 at $40,000; $880 at $50,000; and, $1,148 at $75,000 and up. He proposed mimicking Gov. Mike Beebe&#x27;s phase-out of the sales tax on groceries as his blueprint for restructuring the tax code. Ross said, &quot;I want to modernize our income tax code in a way that means lower, fairer taxes for working families and small businesses in Arkansas, and I want to do so in a fiscally responsible way that maintains our balanced budget and protects vital state services like education, Medicaid and public safety,&quot; Ross said. &quot;Just like Governor Beebe did with the sales tax on groceries, I will also gradually phase in my tax cut plan as the state can afford to do so.&quot; The crux of Ross&#x27; plan would be to retroactively index Arkansas income tax brackets taking a 1997 state law and applying it to the 1971 realignment of the tax code. Act 328 of 1997 tied state income tax brackets to inflation on a forward-going basis.

Ross also announced a plan to create a &quot;senior bill of rights,&quot; which would result in services for seniors centered on seven policy areas, including healthcare, food security and more simple access to information about government programs.

<doc id="408555" wikidata="Q1371530" url="?curid=408555" title="Kissing number">
<text>In geometry, the kissing number of a mathematical space is defined as the greatest number of non-overlapping unit spheres that can be arranged in that space such that they each touch a common unit sphere. For a given sphere packing (arrangement of spheres) in a given space, a kissing number can also be defined for each individual sphere as the number of spheres it touches. For a lattice packing the kissing number is the same for every sphere, but for an arbitrary sphere packing the kissing number may vary from one sphere to another. 

Other names for kissing number that have been used are Newton number (after the originator of the problem), and contact number.

In general, the kissing number problem seeks the maximum possible kissing number for &quot;n&quot;-dimensional spheres in (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space. Ordinary spheres correspond to two-dimensional closed surfaces in three-dimensional space.

Finding the kissing number when centers of spheres are confined to a line (the one-dimensional case) or a plane (two-dimensional case) is trivial. Proving a solution to the three-dimensional case, despite being easy to conceptualise and model in the physical world, eluded mathematicians until the mid-20th century. Solutions in higher dimensions are considerably more challenging, and only a handful of cases have been solved exactly. For others, investigations have determined upper and lower bounds, but not exact solutions.

==Known greatest kissing numbers==
===One dimension===
In one dimension, the kissing number is 2:
===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, the kissing number is 6:

Proof: Consider a circle with center &quot;C&quot; that is touched by circles with centers &quot;C&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2, ... Consider the rays &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot;. These rays all emanate from the same center &quot;C&quot;, so the sum of angles between adjacent rays is 360°.

Assume by contradiction that there are more than six touching circles. Then at least two adjacent rays, say &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot;2, are separated by an angle of less than 60°. The segments &quot;C Ci&quot; have the same length – 2&quot;r&quot; – for all &quot;i&quot;. Therefore, the triangle &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot;1 &quot;C&quot;2 is isosceles, and its third side – &quot;C&quot;1 &quot;C&quot;2 – has a side length of less than 2&quot;r&quot;. Therefore, the circles 1 and 2 intersect – a contradiction.

===Three dimensions===
In three dimensions, the kissing number is 12, but the correct value was much more difficult to establish than in dimensions one and two. It is easy to arrange 12 spheres so that each touches a central sphere, with a lot of space left over, and it is not obvious that there is no way to pack in a 13th sphere. (In fact, there is so much extra space that any two of the 12 outer spheres can exchange places through a continuous movement without any of the outer spheres losing contact with the center one.) This was the subject of a famous disagreement between mathematicians Isaac Newton and David Gregory. Newton correctly thought that the limit was 12; Gregory thought that a 13th could fit. Some incomplete proofs that Newton was correct were offered in the nineteenth century, most notably one by Reinhold Hoppe, but the first correct proof (according to Brass, Moser, and Pach) did not appear until 1953.

The twelve neighbors of the central sphere correspond to the maximum bulk coordination number of an atom in a crystal lattice in which all atoms have the same size (as in a chemical element). A coordination number of 12 is found in a cubic close-packed or a hexagonal close-packed structure.

===Larger dimensions===
In four dimensions, the kissing number is 24. This was proven in 2003 by Oleg Musin. Previously, the answer was thought to be either 24 or 25: it is straightforward to produce a packing of 24 spheres around a central sphere (one can place the spheres at the vertices of a suitably scaled 24-cell centered at the origin), but, as in the three-dimensional case, there is a lot of space left over — even more, in fact, than for &quot;n&quot; = 3 — so the situation was even less clear.

The existence of the highly symmetrical &quot;E&quot;8 lattice and Leech lattice has allowed known results for &quot;n&quot; = 8 (where the kissing number is 240), and &quot;n&quot; = 24 (where it is 196,560).
The kissing number in &quot;n&quot; dimensions is unknown for other dimensions.

If arrangements are restricted to &quot;lattice&quot; arrangements, in which the centres of the spheres all lie on points in a lattice, then this restricted kissing number is known for &quot;n&quot; = 1 to 9 and &quot;n&quot; = 24 dimensions. For 5, 6, and 7 dimensions the arrangement with the highest known kissing number found so far is the optimal lattice arrangement, but the existence of a non-lattice arrangement with a higher kissing number has not been excluded.

==Some known bounds==

The following table lists some known bounds on the kissing number in various dimensions. The dimensions in which the kissing number is known are listed in boldface.


==Generalization==
The kissing number problem can be generalized to the problem of finding the maximum number of non-overlapping congruent copies of any convex body that touch a given copy of the body. There are different versions of the problem depending on whether the copies are only required to be congruent to the original body, translates of the original body, or translated by a lattice. For the regular tetrahedron, for example, it is known that both the lattice kissing number and the translative kissing number are equal to 18, whereas the congruent kissing number is at least 56.

==Algorithms==
There are several approximation algorithms on intersection graphs where the approximation ratio depends on the kissing number. For example, there is 
a polynomial-time 10-approximation algorithm to find a maximum non-intersecting subset of a set of rotated unit squares.

==Mathematical statement==
The kissing number problem can be stated as the existence of a solution to a set of inequalities. Let formula_1 be a set of &quot;N&quot; &quot;D&quot;-dimensional position vectors of the centres of the spheres. The condition that this set of spheres can lie round the centre sphere without overlapping is:
formula_2

Thus the problem for each dimension can be expressed in the existential theory of the reals. However, general methods of solving problems in this form take at least exponential time which is why this problem has only been solved up to four dimensions. By adding additional variables, formula_3 this can be converted to a single quartic equation in &quot;N&quot;(&quot;N&quot; − 1)/2 + &quot;DN&quot; variables:
formula_4

Therefore, to solve the case in &quot;D&quot; = 5 dimensions and &quot;N&quot; = 40 + 1 vectors would be equivalent to determining the existence of real solutions to a quartic polynomial in 1025 variables. For the &quot;D&quot; = 24 dimensions and &quot;N&quot; = 196560 + 1, the quartic would have 19,322,732,544 variables. An alternative statement in terms of distance geometry is given by the distances squared formula_5 between the &quot;m&quot;th and &quot;n&quot;th sphere:
formula_6

This must be supplemented with the condition that the Cayley–Menger determinant is zero for any set of points which forms a (&quot;D&quot; + 1) simplex in &quot;D&quot; dimensions, since that volume must be zero. Setting formula_7 gives a set of simultaneous polynomial equations in just &quot;y&quot; which must be solved for real values only. The two methods, being entirely equivalent, have various different uses. For example, in the second case one can randomly alter the values of the &quot;y&quot; by small amounts to try to minimise the polynomial in terms of the &quot;y&quot;.

<doc id="408559" wikidata="Q933328" url="?curid=408559" title="DuckTales (video game)">
<text>DuckTales is a platform game developed and published by Capcom and based on the Disney animated TV series of the same name. It was first released in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989 and was later ported to the Game Boy in 1990. The story involves Scrooge McDuck traveling around the globe collecting treasure and outwitting his rival Flintheart Glomgold to become the world&#x27;s richest duck.

Produced by key personnel from the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, &quot;DuckTales&quot; sold over a million copies worldwide on each system, becoming Capcom&#x27;s best-selling title for both platforms. The game was praised for its controls, unique and open-ended gameplay and bright presentation, and is often regarded as one of the best titles for the NES, appearing on numerous &quot;Best of&quot; lists.

&quot;DuckTales&quot; was followed by a sequel, &quot;DuckTales 2&quot;, in 1993. A remastered version of &quot;DuckTales&quot; developed by WayForward Technologies, featuring high resolution graphics and performances by the surviving members of the show&#x27;s voice cast, named &quot;&quot;, was released in 2013 for PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii U. The original 8-bit version of the game was also included in &quot;The Disney Afternoon Collection&quot; compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

==Gameplay==
Players control Scrooge McDuck as he travels around the world and in outer space in search of five treasures to further increase his fortune. Scrooge is able to attack enemies and get around using his cane. On the ground, Scrooge can swing his cane to attack enemies and to break open or throw certain objects. While jumping, Scrooge can bounce on his cane similarly to a pogo stick and attack enemies from above. This also allows him to reach higher areas as well as bounce across hazardous areas that hurt his palmate. Along the way, Scrooge can find various diamonds, hidden inside treasure chests or appearing in certain areas, to increase his fortune and ice cream that can restore his health. Scrooge will also encounter various characters from the series who have a variety of roles, such as providing hints, offering useful items, opening access to new areas, or attempting to stop Scrooge&#x27;s progress. Hidden in the game is a secret life-restoring cheat, accessed by pressing the select button while standing still, that will refill Scrooge&#x27;s heart points for $3,000,000.

The game features five levels: African mines, The Amazon, The Himalayas, Transylvania, and the Moon. The player can visit any of the destinations to pursue the treasures in any order. However, The African mines and Transylvania must be revisited to acquire certain essential items. Two secret treasures are scattered between all five destinations. Each destination&#x27;s treasure is protected by a boss that Scrooge must defeat to retrieve. When all five main treasures are collected, the player returns to Transylvania for a final boss fight against Dracula Duck. After defeating him, the player must contend with Flintheart Glomgold and Magica DeSpell for the final treasure.

Upon completing the game, players can receive one of three endings based on their performance: a regular ending for simply clearing the game, a great ending for clearing the game with at least $10,000,000, and a bad ending for clearing the game with $0. As the player is given $1,000,000 for each level&#x27;s treasure, the bad ending is only achievable by spending all accumulated money on the life-restore cheat before the player ends the game. In order to do that, the player has to collect exactly $1,000,000 to get a total money of $6,000,000 because one gets a total of $5,000,000 from the bosses. Then, the player has to apply the life-restore cheat two times to end up with $0.

==Development==
Although Capcom had previously worked with Disney by publishing the Hudson-produced &quot;Mickey Mousecapade&quot; in North America in 1988, &quot;DuckTales&quot; became the first licensed game that the company developed, and shared many key personnel with the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series including producer Tokuro Fujiwara, character designer Keiji Inafune, and sound programmer Yoshihiro Sakaguchi.

Revisions to the game included the removal of crosses from the coffins in the Transylvania stage, replacing them with the letters &quot;RIP&quot;, replacing hamburgers as power-ups with ice cream, and the omission of an option for Scrooge to give his money up, an action deemed too &quot;un-Scrooge-like&quot;. Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s shirt sprite was changed from blue to red to make him stand out and pop more against the blue and dark backgrounds. A leaked prototype cartridge from a private collector reveals several differences between the original, unfinished version and the final release, such as different level names, unused music for the Transylvania stage, slower tempo on the music for the Moon stage, unused or altered text, and the character Gizmoduck going by his Japanese name &quot;RoboDuck&quot;. Despite the changes, images of the unfinished beta version could be seen in the 1990 books &quot;Consumer Guide: Hot Tips for the Coolest Nintendo Games&quot; and the &quot;NES Game Atlas&quot; by Nintendo.

&quot;DuckTales&quot; was later ported to the Game Boy in late 1990. This version features the same gameplay, music and levels of the original console release, though the layout of each level was changed to accommodate the handheld&#x27;s lower resolution screen.

==Reception==

&quot;DuckTales&quot; was a commercial success, with the NES and Game Boy versions selling approximately 1.67 million and 1.43 million copies worldwide respectively, each becoming Capcom&#x27;s highest-selling titles for their respective platforms. It was released to generally positive reviews, with &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praising the NES version for its gameplay and colorful graphics, calling it &quot;a prime example of very good game design&quot;. The magazine additionally commented that the title was probably made &quot;with younger players in mind&quot; due to its short length and relative lack of difficulty or complexity, declaring that &quot;you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this game but find it beaten after the first day of play&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Mean Machines&quot; magazine called the game &quot;very tough and challenging&quot;, elaborating that &quot;it requires plenty of skill to get all the way through the game in one go&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; later called the Game Boy port &quot;a faithful translation from the NES version&quot;.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed &quot;DuckTales&quot; as the 13th best Nintendo Entertainment System game in 2008, praising it as fun in spite of being a licensed product. The magazine later placed the game 44th in its list of the &quot;285 Greatest Games of All Time&quot; in 2012. In 2009, website IGN ranked the title 10th on its list of the 100 greatest NES games, remarking that &quot;out of all of the games built on Capcom&#x27;s famous &quot;Mega Man&quot; architecture (but wasn&#x27;t an actual &quot;Mega Man&quot; game), Duck Tales is perhaps the best of the bunch&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; also included the game at number 85 on their own list of the &quot;100 Best Nintendo Games&quot; that same year, and 9th in its &quot;Top Ten Best NES Games&quot; list in 2013. It also placed 9th on 1UP.com&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 NES Games&quot; feature in 2010, 2nd in GamesRadar&#x27;s own &quot;Top 7 Disney Games&quot; list in 2009, and 12th in GamesRadar&#x27;s &quot;Best NES Games of All Time&quot; list in 2012.

Creative director of &quot;DuckTales Remastered&quot;, Matt Bozon, called the music of &quot;DuckTales&quot; &quot;some of the best 8-bit music [he&#x27;s] ever heard&quot;, with his developer team citing themes as that of the Transylvania and Himalayas stages as memorable. &quot;Polygon&quot; cites the &quot;Moon Theme&quot; as the most famous piece of music from the title, with Geekparty calling it &quot;the most perfect piece of 8-bit music ever written&quot;. The &quot;Moon Theme&quot; appears in the 2017 animated series reboot during scenes set on the moon, most prominently as the basis for a lullaby that Della Duck sings in the second-season episode &quot;What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!&quot;

==&quot;DuckTales: Remastered&quot;==

A remake of the game, titled &quot;DuckTales: Remastered&quot;, was released in 2013 for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U and in 2015 for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Developed by WayForward Technologies, &quot;Remastered&quot; features updated graphics and music, expanded story content, and full voice-acting for the characters, including the surviving members of the animated series&#x27; cast. The original game&#x27;s levels are included, but expanded with new areas and new boss patterns, along with two new levels exclusive to &quot;Remastered&quot;.

<doc id="408561" wikidata="Q955996" url="?curid=408561" title="Todd Tiahrt">
<text>William Todd Tiahrt ( ; born June 15, 1951) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1995 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected as part of the historic Republican Wave of 1994, defeating 18-year incumbent U.S. Representative Dan Glickman. He ran in 2010 for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Sam Brownback. He lost to fellow Republican U.S. Representative Jerry Moran of Hays, Kansas, 50%–45%.

Tiahrt twice sought to regain the 4th District House seat, representing a district which encompasses eleven counties in the south central region of the state, including the City of Wichita. In 2014, he ran against incumbent Mike Pompeo in the Republican primary but was defeated. Then, in 2017, after Pompeo vacated the seat to become President Donald Trump&#x27;s CIA Director, Tiahrt sought the Republican nomination for the special election to fill it, but came in third, losing to Kansas state treasurer Ron Estes.

==Early life, education and career==
Tiahrt was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, the son of Marcine (née Steele) and Wilbur E. Tiahrt. He attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where he played football as a running back. He went on to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Evangel College in 1975, and received a M.B.A. from Southwest Missouri State University in 1989. He was a teacher at Kansas Newman College and Evangel College and worked for Boeing as a proposal manager.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Tiahrt was elected to the Kansas State Senate in 1992. After only one term, in 1994, he won the Republican nomination for the 4th Congressional District and was elected in an upset over 18-year Democratic incumbent Dan Glickman. Over 1,800 people volunteered for Tiahrt&#x27;s campaign which spent only $200,000, less than a quarter of Glickman&#x27;s expenditures.

One factor in the win was the 1990s reapportionment, in which Hutchinson and surrounding Reno County were shifted to the &quot;Big 1st&quot; District. Hutchinson was replaced with more reliably Republican Montgomery County. After a tough reelection bid in 1996, Tiahrt was reelected to the U.S. House six more times with little difficulty, before his unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid in 2010.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and General Government
**Subcommittee on District of Columbia
**Subcommittee on Military Construction
**Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch
*House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence

===Leadership roles and caucus memberships===
* Dean of Kansas&#x27; delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives
* Founder and chairman of the House Economic Competitiveness Caucus
*Deputy Majority Whip

===Impeachment of Bill Clinton===

In November 1997, Tiahrt was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Tiahrt voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Tiahrt voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).

===Tiahrt Amendment===

Tiahrt is the author of the Tiahrt Amendment which prohibits the National Tracing Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) from releasing information from its firearms trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement agency or prosecutor in connection with a criminal investigation.

This precludes gun trace data from being used in academic research of gun use in crime. Additionally, the law blocks any data legally released from being admissible in civil lawsuits against gun sellers or manufacturers. Some groups, including the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, believe that having further access to the ATF database would help municipal police departments track down sellers of illegal guns and curb crime. These groups are trying to undo the Tiahrt Amendment.

Numerous police organizations oppose the Tiahrt Amendment, such as the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). Conversely, the Tiahrt Amendment is supported by the National Rifle Association of America, and the Fraternal Order of Police (although it allows municipal police departments only limited access to ATF trace data in any criminal investigation). The NRA has claimed that undoing the Tiahrt Amendment would lead to a rash of lawsuits against gun dealers.

In their 2010 letter of appreciation on behalf of the NRA Political Victory Fund and the 50,000 NRA members in Kansas, Tiahrt was honored with a 4th consecutive congressional race A+ rating for his contributions to the pro-gun efforts.

Tiahrt had earned the highest rating, by &quot;voting for every pro-gun bill.&quot; This included &quot;critical pro-gun reforms&quot; like the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA); &quot;legislation to expand Right-to-Carry to national parks and wildlife refuges&quot;, the Tiahrt Amendment to reform the ATF, and &quot;legislation to restore&quot; Second Amendment rights to Washington, DC. The A+ ranking took into consideration the letter he submitted to court briefs that he signed as a &quot;critical friend of the court briefs&quot; in the 2008 landmark case District of Columbia v. Heller, in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual&#x27;s right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home, and that Washington, D.C.&#x27;s handgun ban and requirement that lawfully-owned rifles and shotguns be kept &quot;unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock&quot; violated this guarantee. and the 2010 SC case McDonald v. Chicago which found that the right of an individual to &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against the states, clearing up any uncertainty left in the wake of the Heller case.

===Tiahrt-Bilbray Bill Fairness for American Students Act===
A bill was introduced by Tiahrt and Congressman Brian Bilbray (R-CA) called the Fairness for American Students Act that would close a loophole in current law that several states have used to provide lower-cost college tuition to illegal immigrants compared to tuition rates U.S. citizens from neighboring states have to pay. Kansas and Nebraska are two of the states that currently offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.

=== Former Tiahrt congressional staff ===
Matt Schlapp is chairman of the American Conservative Union and a Fox News political commentator. Schlapp began his political career as a campaign volunteer for Tiahrt in 1994 and following Tiahrt&#x27;s election in November 1994, Schlapp moved to Washington, D.C. to serve as Tiahrt&#x27;s communications director and eventually chief of staff for five years. He later served as White House Political Director for President George W. Bush.

Matthew Stroia serves as chief of staff to U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA). He served as a legislative counsel for Tiahrt from 2008 to 2011.

Joel Katz currently serves as district director for U.S. Representative Andrew Clyde (R-GA). He served as legislative correspondent for Tiahrt from 2009 to 2011, and then went on to serve as legislative assistant for U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and chief of staff to U.S. Representative Doug Collins (R-GA).

Jeff Kahrs began as an intern for Tiahrt in the Kansas State Senate from 1993 to 1994 and later served as Tiahrt&#x27;s legislative director and chief of staff from 1995 to 2010. Kahrs currently serves as senior advisor to U.S. Representative Jake LaTurner (R-KS).

Josh Bell served as a legislative correspondent and aide for Tiahrt from 2002 to 2011. He currently serve as chief of staff to U.S. Representative Ron Estes (R-KS).

Robert Noland was the only employee of Tiahrt&#x27;s congressional campaign in 1994 and worked for Tiahrt throughout his tenure in the U.S. House, mostly as his district director in Wichita. Noland later served as executive director of the Kansas Family Policy Council.

==Political positions==
===Abortion and family planning===
Tiahrt opposed government-funded abortions. While serving in Congress, he spoke at the annual March for Life.

The &quot;Tiahrt Amendment&quot; of 1998, which was most recently included in the FY2020 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, ensures that no government funding is used in connection with forcible sterilizations in foreign countries. The amendment ensures that in foreign countries where the U.S. government funds voluntary family planning projects, women are not denied the right to participate in any general welfare program or denied the right of access to health care. Further, the amendment requires that any experimental contraceptive drugs and devices and medical procedures are provided only in the context of a scientific study in which participants are advised of potential risks and benefits.

Concern that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was possibly funding a forced sterilization campaign in Peru led Tiahrt to enact the Amendment.

===Government funding for needles===
Tiahrt was cited as responsible for preventing the City of Washington D.C., from spending federal or District funding on &quot;needle exchange programs&quot; for drug users from 1998 through 2007.

===Comments on the TSA===
On November 23, 2010, Tiahrt spoke in Wichita against recent TSA security measures and how they affect citizens&#x27; privacy. In 2009, along with Kansas&#x27; then-U.S. Senators, he co-authored a letter to the Homeland Security Secretary expressing concerns over new rules for privately owned aircraft over 12,500 pounds, which critics feared would further burden the already hurting private aviation industry and in turn the local communities where the small aircraft are manufactured in Kansas.

===Stimulus spending===
Tiahrt voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and spoke against the stimulus in the House, planning to introduce an act to repeal the stimulus.

==Personal life==
Tiahrt and his wife Vicki met while attending Evangel University. They have three children, Jessica, John and Luke, and five grandchildren. Jessica Tiahrt Healy graduated from George Mason University School of Law and is an attorney at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. John Tiahrt graduated from Wichita State University. On July 24, 2004, the Tiahrts&#x27; youngest child, sixteen year-old Luke, died of an apparent suicide at the family home in Virginia. The family established the Luke Tiahrt Memorial Fund to provide grants to organizations that benefits teenagers.

<doc id="408566" wikidata="Q1110294" url="?curid=408566" title="Martin Atkins">
<text>Martin Clive Atkins (born 3 August 1959) is an English drummer, best known for his work in post-punk and industrial groups including Public Image Ltd, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Pigface, and Killing Joke. He also works as a consultant, has written multiple books on the music industry, and is the music industry studies coordinator at Millikin University in Decatur, IL. Atkins is the owner and operator of the Museum of Post Punk and Industrial Music in Chicago, is an honorary board member of the Chicago-based nonprofit organization Rock For Kids, and a fellow of In Place of War.

== Early life ==
Atkins was born in Coventry, England.

== Career ==

=== 1979–1985 ===
Atkins&#x27; first major exposure as a drummer was with John Lydon&#x27;s post-Sex Pistols band, Public Image Ltd. He joined in 1979, just in time to contribute to the song &quot;Bad Baby&quot; on the album &quot;Metal Box&quot;. Atkins&#x27; first live show with PiL was recorded and released as a live album &quot;Paris au Printemps&quot; and his first year with the band included appearances on The John Peel Sessions for the BBC, &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s live &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;.

In 1980, Atkins left Public Image Ltd to concentrate on his band Brian Brain with Pete Jones (who also played with Public Image Ltd in 1982 and 1983) on bass (in 1983 replaced by original Go-Gos&#x27; bassist Margot Olavarria) and Bobby Surgeoner on guitar (later replaced by Olavarria&#x27;s husband, Geoff Smyth). Named after the Worcestershire and Gloucestershire seam bowler Brian Brain, the band released six singles and one LP (&quot;Unexpected Noises&quot;) on Secret Records, and continued to release singles and LPs on Atkins&#x27; own Plaid Records throughout the 1980s. The band had a minor indie chart hit in 1980 with &quot;They&#x27;ve Got Me in the Bottle&quot; (#39), and club hits with the singles &quot;Jive Jive&quot; (1981) and &quot;Funky Zoo&quot; (1982).

Atkins was hired in late 1980 by Public Image Ltd to perform on &quot;The Flowers of Romance&quot;, drumming on four tracks. In 1982 he re-joined as a full-time band member, co-producing and co-writing the album &quot;This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get&quot;. Atkins left PiL for the last time in 1985.

=== 1985–2005 ===
After leaving Public Image Ltd, Atkins revived his Brian Brain project and recorded an EP at Planet Sound Studios in New York for his own, short-lived label &quot;Plaid Records&quot;, which was released in July 1985. Throughout the late 1980s, the 1990s and early 2000s, Atkins performed with many bands, including Nine Inch Nails (appearing in the video for &quot;Head Like A Hole&quot;), as well as Ministry. The dual-drumming of Atkins and Bill Rieflin appears on the live Ministry album/video &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot;. Atkins later joined Killing Joke, performing on 1990s &quot;Extremities, Dirt, and Other Repressed Emotions&quot;. He also managed the band for that time, and designed their live show scenery and some merchandise.

Atkins formed his industrial supergroup, Pigface, during a Ministry tour in 1989–1990. After joining Killing Joke for their 1990 recording, &quot;Extremities, Dirt and Various Repressed Emotions&quot;, he went on to form Murder, Inc., a new band featuring Geordie Walker and Paul Raven from Killing Joke, and Chris Connelly, in 1992. During this time, he played with the Revolting Cocks and is credited alongside Chris Vrenna in Nine Inch Nails for performing extra drums on &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Gave Up,&quot; tracks two and six of the &quot;Broken&quot; EP (as well as the aforementioned &quot;Head Like A Hole&quot;).

In between creating albums and touring with Pigface he also formed The Damage Manual with Jah Wobble, Walker, and Connelly. Atkins later produced and released a collaborative album with Skinny Puppy&#x27;s Nivek Ogre, the latter&#x27;s first project outside of Skinny Puppy, under the moniker Rx. The resulting album was entitled &quot;Bedside Toxicology&quot;.

Between 2000 and 2002 he released four albums as Opium Jukebox featuring instrumental cover tunes done in a Bhangra style.

=== 2006–present ===
In October 2006, Atkins visited Beijing to discover the emerging Chinese music scene. During his stay, Atkins recorded and signed a handful of Chinese bands to Invisible Records and recorded material for a new Pigface album.

Atkins has taught at Columbia College in Chicago where he instructed the course &quot;The Business of Touring&quot;. He is also an active guest lecturer, speaking at such institutions as the University of Southern California, the Midi School in Beijing and Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pennsylvania. Atkins has since become an instructor at the Madison Media Institute in Madison, Wisconsin. Atkins has announced plans to take his lecturing further by eventually opening a school of his own. He is also a former department chairman for a music business program he designed at SAE Chicago. He now is the acting Music Business program coordinator at Millikin University in Decatur, IL.

Atkins has held a number of seminars at Tech Music Schools (Drumtech, Vocaltech, Guitar-X and Keyboardtech) in London, with more planned for the future.

Atkins has written what he calls &quot;the first real book on touring&quot;. The book &quot;Tour:Smart&quot;, featured contributions from Henry Rollins, Cynthia Plastercaster, The Enigma, the Suicide Girls, Zim Zum (formerly of Marilyn Manson), Kevin Lyman, Curse Mackey, CPA Lisa Malina and various other managers, journalists, venues, agents, sponsors, and radio personalities.

Atkins was on the tenth annual Independent Music Awards judging panel, and was also a judge for the seventh annual season of Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

Starting in 2015, Atkins has written and performed several podcast stories for The Martin Atkins Minute, included with the NPR All Songs Considered podcast.

In 2018 Martin released &quot;Band:Smart&quot;, the follow-up to his &quot;Tour:Smart&quot; book. This book covers record labels, book agents, crafting a stage show, band names, social media and lots more.

In 2021, Martin opened Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Museum of Post Punk and Industrial Music&quot; documenting the history of the two movements with over 3000 items and ephemera. Displays include handwritten lyrics by Trent Reznor for Pigface, Martin&#x27;s drum set, vintage rarities from Skinny Puppy, and a myriad of other rare items from the history of Industrial music. 

In 2022, Martin was also inducted by Brian Eno as a fellow of In Place of War, a global organization that uses creativity in places of conflict as a tool for positive change.

<doc id="408567" wikidata="Q2630920" url="?curid=408567" title="DuckTales 2">
<text>DuckTales 2 is a platform video game developed and published by Capcom. It is a sequel to the original &quot;DuckTales&quot; based on the Disney animated series of the same name. It was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in early 1993. The title was ported to the Game Boy handheld system in Japan and North America at the end of the year.

The game was included in &quot;The Disney Afternoon Collection&quot; compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One released in April 2017.

== Gameplay ==

Like its predecessor, &quot;DuckTales 2&quot; is non-linear and allows the player to choose and complete all levels in any particular order. The controls are the same as the previous game, albeit the cane jump is easier to perform. Scrooge can now use his cane to interact with various objects, such as pulling levers, firing cannons and using springy flowers to cross large gaps. Other new mechanics include hooks that Scrooge can hang from and rafts that can move Scrooge across water.

Unlike the first game, the player can return to a level that has already been completed to collect more money and items. In addition, upgrades for Scrooge&#x27;s cane can be obtained from Gyro Gearloose to grant the player access to new and hidden areas in each level. When a level is completed, the player can visit a store to buy recovery items, extra lives, and other such items using any money the player has collected.

In addition to the unique treasures, each stage has a piece of the map that is hidden in a treasure chest. Locating all of the map pieces is not required to complete the game, but collecting all of them opens up an optional sixth stage in which the lost treasure of McDuck can be found.

== Plot ==
As the game opens, Huey runs to his uncle Scrooge McDuck with a torn piece of paper, which is a piece of a treasure map drawn by Fergus McDuck. Inspired to discover the hidden treasure left by Fergus, Scrooge starts an expedition to find the missing pieces, unaware that his archenemy Flintheart Glomgold is also after the lost treasure of McDuck.

Scrooge travels to Niagara Falls, a pirate ship in the Bermuda Triangle, Mu, Egypt and Scotland. Each area has its own unique treasure that is guarded by a boss. After all five main stages are cleared, Webby is kidnapped by Glomgold and held for ransom on the pirate ship in the Bermuda Triangle. Scrooge arrives and gives Glomgold the treasures, only to discover that this &quot;Glomgold&quot; is actually a shapeshifting robot called the D-1000 programmed to destroy him. After the D-1000 is defeated, Glomgold sinks the ship and tries to take Scrooge and the treasures with it.

Scrooge and Webby escape the ship, but the treasures go down with the vessel. Despite the loss, Scrooge admits that at least he and his family are safe and that their friendship is what truly matters. The treasures are recovered by Launchpad, cheering everybody up. If the lost treasure of McDuck was found, Scrooge reveals that he hid it from Glomgold by putting it under his hat. However, if the player has no money left at all, a bad ending plays in which Glomgold finds the lost treasure and is named the greatest adventurer in the world, which infuriates Scrooge.

== Reception ==
&quot;DuckTales 2&quot;″s limited production run and relatively late release in June 1993, near the end of the Nintendo Entertainment System&#x27;s life cycle, led to lower sales than its predecessor, and has become a rarity amongst collectors. The console version was generally well-received, with &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praising the title&#x27;s &quot;great play control and graphics&quot;, but remarked that it was &quot;more of the same&quot; when compared to the original. &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly felt that &quot;if it&#x27;s more of the same you want, &quot;DuckTales 2&quot; delivers&quot;, adding that the game &quot;is fun while it lasts, but it&#x27;s too short&quot;, nonetheless recommending it to new players.

The Game Boy version was panned by editors of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, remarking that it only had &quot;so-so&quot; graphics and &quot;OK&quot; control, and didn&#x27;t live up to Capcom&#x27;s previous handheld titles such as the &quot;Mega Man&quot; games. &quot;GamePro&quot;, however, felt that the game was a faithful port of the console version, applauding its &quot;sharp, clean graphics, innovative gameplay and engrossing storyline&quot;.

<doc id="408571" wikidata="Q954893" url="?curid=408571" title="Dennis Moore (politician)">
<text>Dennis Moore (November 8, 1945 – November 2, 2021) was an American politician and lawyer, a &quot;Blue Dog&quot; centrist who served for six terms as a U.S. Representative for , from 1999 until 2011. He was a member of the Kansas Democratic Party.

He and Sharice Davids have been the only two Kansas Democrats to serve in Congress since January 2009.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born in 1945 in Anthony in southcentral Harper County, Kansas. He attended the University of Kansas, from which he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and was briefly enrolled at Southern Methodist University. He received a Juris Doctor degree from Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas.

==Career==
Moore served in the United States Army before becoming Assistant Kansas Attorney General. After a period in private practice, he was elected District Attorney in northeast Johnson County, serving in that capacity from 1977 to 1989. While a defense attorney at the practice of Moriarty, Erker &amp; Moore, he represented Debora Green when she was charged with murder in 1995. The case ended in 1996 with Green pleading no contest to the charges.

Moore was first elected to the United States House in 1998, defeating the Republican incumbent, Vince Snowbarger. The district had traditionally elected moderate Republicans, but Snowbarger&#x27;s unyielding conservatism caused many voters to shift to Moore. He thus became the first Democrat to represent the district in 37 years, after Democrat Newell A. George lost re-election to Republican Robert Fred Ellsworth, when it was the 2nd District. (It was renumbered the 3rd District by 1963.)

Moore faced Republican conservative Phill Kline in 2000. He narrowly held his seat, taking 50% of the vote. His margin of victory was fairly close believed to be due to George W. Bush&#x27;s strong performance in the district. In 2002, he won another close race, this time against moderate Republican Adam Taff, an airline pilot. In 2004, Moore defeated law professor Kris Kobach, another conservative, in the general election, with 55% of the vote.

In the 2006 Congressional election, Moore successfully defended his seat against Republican Chuck Ahner, winning with 64% of the vote, a much larger margin than he had in the past.

In August 2007, Republican State Senator Nick Jordan of Shawnee announced he would challenge Moore for the 3rd District seat in 2008. Moore defeated Jordan by a vote of 56% to 40%.

On November 23, 2009, it was reported that after six terms, Dennis Moore would not seek re-election in 2010, when he would turn 65 years old. Moore&#x27;s wife, Stephene Moore, became the Democratic nominee. She lost the election to Republican State Representative Kevin Yoder. The district was not represented by a Democrat again until 2019 after it was taken by Native American attorney Sharice Davids.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
While in office Moore represented Kansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, the state&#x27;s smallest and most affluent, which includes most of the Kansas side of the Kansas City metropolitan area, including Kansas City, Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, Lenexa and De Soto. During his early tenure the university town of Lawrence was located in the third district but was later redistricted to the 2nd District.

<doc id="408574" wikidata="Q10832464" url="?curid=408574" title="Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City">
<text>Venustiano Carranza is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City, Mexico. Venustiano Carranza extends from the far eastern portion of the historic center of Mexico City eastward to the Peñón de los Baños and the border dividing the then Federal District from the State of Mexico. Historically, most of the territory was under Lake Texcoco, but over the colonial period into the 20th century, the lake dried up and today the area is completely urbanized. The borough is home to three of Mexico City&#x27;s major traditional markets, including La Merced, the National Archives of Mexico, the Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro, the TAPO intercity bus terminal and the Mexico City Airport.

==Geography==
The borough is located in the center-east of Mexico City. It borders Gustavo A. Madero, Cuauhtémoc and Iztacalco with the State of Mexico to the east. The territory measures which is 2.24% of the total of Mexico City. The borough has 2,290 blocks and eighty officially designated neighborhoods.

It has an average altitude of above sea level with most of the surface flat. The territory is mostly the bed of the former Lake Texcoco with soils of compressed clay over sand, with the exception of the Peñón de los Baños at above sea level, made of basalt. Because it is mostly former lakebed, flooding (especially during the rainy season from June to October) and hailstorms in winter, are not uncommon. Flooding is often caused or exacerbated by the deteriorated drainage system. Aside from the one elevation, the far west of the borough corresponds to the far east of the former Tenochtitlan island. For this reason, about one quarter of the historic center of Mexico City belongs to the borough. It has a semi dry, temperate climate with an average annual temperature of and an average rainfall of .

In the parks and other green spaces of the borough, trees such as ash, white cedar, cypress, fig and Indian laurel, various scrubs and grasses can be found. Wildlife is limited to birds, rodents, lizards and insects. In 2011, reforestation efforts took place in four areas of the borough, planting 15,000 trees.

==Neighborhoods==
One of the notable neighborhoods of the borough is Magdalena Mixhuca. The community was a small island in Lake Texcoco in the pre Hispanic period and eventually became physically connected to the surrounding areas as the lake dried up. However, the area is still marked by the existence of small one-story houses with look very similar often painted some shade of orange, making it look like a small town. The kiosk in the community center is also painted the same color. Next to the plaza it is on is the church of Santa María Magdalena Mixhuca with an image of Mary Magdalene inside. The name Mixhuca comes from Nahuatl and means place of childbirth. The area is dedicated to Mary Magdalene because the first-born daughter of Moctezuma II requested such from Hernán Cortés .

Other notable neighborhoods include Colonia Balbuena, named after poet Bernardo de Balbuena, La Candelaria de los Patos, which gets its name from the large flocks of ducks that used to live here when the area was still lake, El Parque, Jamaica, Zaragoza, Romero Rubio and Gómez Fárias.

==Landmarks==

The borough is home to forty two traditional markets, with over 14,000 individual vendors. This includes three of Mexico City&#x27;s large traditional markets, La Merced Market, Mercado de Sonora and Mercado Jamaica. La Merced is historically and culturally part of the historic center of Mexico City and is the largest retail food market in the city. The main building is 400 meters long with 3,205 stands mostly selling produce and groceries, meats and fish. There is a smaller section devoted to baskets, rope and handcrafts with another building selling leather, storage containers, ornamental plants and prepared food. This market is located in an area which has been a major market and receiving area since the colonial period. The entire neighborhood was filled in informal stands until the first building was constructed in 1860. Until the mid 20th century, La Merced was the main wholesale market, but this function was moved to the new Central de Abastos market in Iztapalapa. Mercado Jamaica is located in the neighborhood of the same name, next to the metro station named after it. It is known for the sale flowers and ornamental plants, but it also sells produce, groceries, meats and a selection of handcrafts. Mercado Sonora was opened in 1957. It is best known for the section dedicated to herbal medicine and the occult such as items associated with Santa Muerte. This section in located in the back. Other items include live animals, dishes, party favors and plastic items.

The National Archives or Archivo General de la Nación (formerly known as the Palacio Negro de Lecumberri) contain a significant part of Mexico&#x27;s written history. Lecumberri was begun in 1885 as a prison when then San Lázaro area was at the city&#x27;s periphery. Construction took 15 years and 2.5 million pesos and was inaugurated in 1900 as the most modern prison in Latin America. The prison was the scene of the incarceration and execution of Francisco I. Madero and José María Pino Suárez in 1913. By the 1970s, the prison had as many as 5,000 prisoners in 1,000 cells. The prison was closed by the end of the decade and renovated to its current use.

The Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro was constructed on the former site of the San Lázaro Railroad Station by José López Portillo in the 1970s, opened in 1981. It was constructed to move the legislative body away from the Donceles Legislative Palace in the historic center of Mexico City. The building was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1989 but was restored in 1992. The façade is of red tezontle stone with white marble in the center with the seal of the country prominently displayed. The vestibule contains a collection of murals depicting Mexico&#x27;s history done by Adolfo Mexiac. The main chamber can seat up to 2000 spectators. When the legislative building was restored, a museum called “Sentimientos de la nación” Legislative Museum was installed. This museum is dedicated to the history of Mexico&#x27;s government and history up to the present.
The main governmental building for the borough is located at Avenida Francisco del Paso y Troncoso in Jardín Balbuena. These offices were opened in 1974 on the site of the former Balbuena military airfield. The building has four murals painted by Montury such as &quot;El canto del cisne&quot;, &quot;Quienes somos&quot;, &quot;América en llamas&quot; y &quot;Dame una palanca y destruiré el mundo&quot;.

Major churches in the area include the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de San Juan de los Lagos in Colonia 20 de Noviembre, Temple of La Soledad y la Santa Cruz in Colonia Merced Balbuena, the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe y La Santísima Hostia Sangrante in Colonia El Parque and the Temple of San Antonio Tomatlán in Colonia Morelos. La Soledad de la Santa Cruz Church was built by Augustine monks. This church was expanded between 1750 and 1789 to three naves supported by pilasters and a new main altar was installed. To the south of this church, the Temple of San Jeronimito was constructed in the La Candelaria de los Patos neighborhood.

The oldest sports facility of Mexico City was built in the Balbuena area with the name of Venustiano Carranza, inaugurated in 1929. Other sports facilities include Centro Deportivo Moctezuma, Centro Deportivo Ramón López Velarde, Centro Deportivo Felipe &quot;Tibio Muñoz,” Centro Deportivo Ing. Eduardo Molina, Centro deportivo José Ma. Pino Suárez, Centro Deportivo Velódromo Olímpico, Centro Deportivo Plutarco Elías Calles and Centro Deportivo Oceanía.

The Centro Cultural Carranza was inaugurated in 2011 in Colonia Jardín Balbuena with the aim of making it the most important recreational and cultural center in the center east of the Federal District.

In addition, the borough contains about one hundred statues, plazas, buildings and gardens which function as monuments to the history of the borough and of Mexico. These include the monument to General Carranza in front of the borough hall, a monument to Simón Bolívar in Jardín Simón Bolívar, a plaque and medallions marking the place where Francisco I. Madero and José María Pino Suárez were executed, and one to Mahatma Gandhi .

The super-regional mall Encuentro Oceanía, including Mexico&#x27;s first IKEA store, opened in the borough in 2021.

==Reenactment of the Battle of Puebla==
The Battle of Puebla has been reenacted each year at the Peñón de los Baños since 1930. Residents of this area dress as the Mexican forces, called Zacapoaxtlas and the French army and even includes the firing of cannons with blanks for effect. The reenactment is performed by hundreds of residents of three neighborhoods around Peñón de los Baños, with the event occurring in the neighborhood of that name. The divide to represent the French army and the band of peasants called Zacapoaxtlas along with Mexican soldiers which won the historical battle. The event begins early in the morning on May 5 with a salute to the Mexican flag and a parade to the Peñón de los Baños mountain. The first act occurs in Barrio del Carmen, then another act to commemorate the Treaty of Loreto and the Treaty of Guadalupe on Hidalgo and Chihualcan Streets. After this, there is a large shared banquet with food provided by area residents to the mock soldiers. Then there is an inspection of the troops by one playing General Zaragoza, with a tradition of cutting the hair of a new member of the troops for “lice.” The last battle occurs in the evening with the French troops climbing on airport side and the Mexican troops on the Río Consulado side. It is at this time that cannons with blanks are fired. When the French are defeated, they run down the mountain and through the Barrio del Carmen where they are chased and then “executed” at the area cemetery. After the day&#x27;s events, there is a festival, dance and carnival.

==History==

===Pre Hispanic era===
The emblem of the borough is the former Aztec glyph used to mark a village name Xochicán as it appears in the Mendocino Codex. The flower image means “place of fragrant flowers.”

Except for the far west which was part of the island of Tenochtitlan, the Peñón de los Baños and a couple of very small islands in-between, the territory of the borough was covered by Lake Texcoco from the pre Hispanic period into the colonial period. The oldest human settlements in the area were located in the Mixuhca and Peñón de los Baños, which were both originally islands in Lake Texcoco. The eastern end of Tenochtitlan was associated with docks and markets that handled the produce and other items that came over the Lake&#x27;s waters into the city from other parts of the Valley of Mexico such as Texcoco, Chalco and Xochimilco. The lake in this area also contained part of the Nezahualcoyotl Dike, built to separate the shallow waters.

The small islands on the lake were also inhabited. One of these was Mexicaltzingo, where the leader of Culhuacán allowed the Mexica to live for a while in exchange for military service. Today this area is at the intersection of Calzada de la Viga and Ermita Iztapalapa. Another area, Mixuhca, was a very small island in the lake and where it is said that one of the sons of Moctezuma II was born. The name is derived from Mixiuhtlán, which means “place of birth” for this reason. The Cerro el Peñón de los Baños was a recreational area for Aztec emperors. It contained a number of hot springs with high mineral content believed to be curative.

===Colonial era===

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish laid out their own capital over the ruins of Tenochtitlán. The eastern end of this city corresponds to the La Merced, San Lázaro and Candelario de los Patos neighborhoods. However, these areas were overpopulated and un-hygienic because of the low, muddy condition of the lands here next to the lake, constantly subject to flooding.

In the 17th century, the San Lazaro dike continued to define the border of Lake Texcoco with firm land. However, the process of the lake&#x27;s desiccation was already evident, expanding the island to allow Mexico City to grow eastward. The drying of the lake lead to the creation of a network of canals, of which the Jamaica and La Viga Canals were most important from the colonial period to the early 20th century. The La Viga Canal linked the La Merced market area to agricultural area southeast of the city, with docks for the canoes called “trajineras” right next to the market.

In the 18th century, the San Antonio Tomatlán and La Candelaria churches were built in the neighborhoods of San Lázaro and Candelaria de los Patos.

===Independence to the present===
During the 19th century, the lake continued to dry up, expanding Mexico City east. One of the roads built on this “new” land was Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza, which today leads to the highway to Puebla and Veracruz. Whether covered in lake or not, the territory of the borough became part of the Federal District when it was created in 1824 and has remained since. In the latter part of the century, a number of Mexico&#x27;s new rail lines terminated at the San Lázaro station, connecting Mexico City with Cuautla and Cuernavaca . The urbanized area extended to what is now the Avenida Congreso de la Unión, with the formation of neighborhoods such as San Lázaro, Santo Tómas, Manzanares, La Soledad, Morelos and Moctezuma. However, much of the land in the 19th century was still swampy with the exception of the far west and the Peñón de los Baños. By 1885, the area was drier but was sparsely populated. A prison was also built in a neighborhood called Lecumberri between 1885 and 1900.

At the end of the 19th century, Mexico City grew east with the establishment of Colonia Morelos, Colonia Penitenciaría and Romero Rubio. Most of the development was working class housing and industrial facilities. Most of the industries were initially connected with food processing and other activities related to the La Merced and Jamaica markets. This would bring the city&#x27;s limits to Eduardo Molina and Avenida Congreso de la Unión by the beginning of the 20th century. Avenida Circunvalación, next to the La Merced Market, still connected to the La Viga Canal. What is now the borough then belonged to two districts: Mexico City proper and the municipality of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

Francisco I. Madero and Pino Suárez were executed next to Lecumberri prison in 1913.

In the 1920s, Calzada Ignacio Zarragoza was built to connect to the city center to the Puebla highway. This main road spurred the development of more subdivisions expanding the urban sprawl east. A large amount of land in this area belonged to a man named Alberto Braniff, who provided it to establish Mexico City&#x27;s first private airstrip in 1909, which became the Aeropuerto Central de la Ciudad de México in 1943. In 1954, the airport relocated, expanded and was reconditioned for international flights to become the Mexico City International Airport. This airport prompted the development of warehouses, hotels, and offices in the area.

In the 1950s Viaducto Miguel Alemán was constructed after encasing the Tacubaya, Piedadad and Becerra rivers in concrete. The La Merced market was expanded and the Mercado Sonora was built. In the mid 20th century, the process of lake drying and new subdivisions was still ongoing, with Colonia Cuatro Arboles begun in 1945, only five years after the lake in this area disappeared.

The modern borough was created in 1970, when the center of Mexico City was split into a four boroughs with the other three being Benito Juárez, Cuauhtémoc and Miguel Hidalgo . The borough was named to honor Mexican Revolution General Venustiano Carranza . By the end of the decade, the entire territory of the borough was urbanized with the exception of the Peñón de los Baños and a reservoir area called the Bordo de Xochiaca, which is now mostly green space.

By 1982, informal stalls around the La Merced Market had invaded over and was threatening to increase indefinitely. This prompted the end of the market as the city&#x27;s main retail center in favor of a new market, Central de Abastos in Iztapalapa. La Merced remains the largest retail market for foodstuffs in Mexico City.

In 2011, the borough broke the record for the world&#x27;s largest torta sandwich, which measured fifty meters long, weighed and was put together in three minutes 57 seconds with seventy different ingredients. The sandwich was created as part of the annual Feria de la Torta.

==Demographics==
Since the 1990s, the borough has had a decrease in population, down from 462,806 from 2000. The borough&#x27;s population accounted for 10.4% of the District&#x27;s total in 1970. It accounted for 5.4% in 2000. One main reason for the decrease is the conversion of land from residential to commercial use.

The dominant religion is Roman Catholicism with over 90% of the population professing this faith. As of 2005, 4,489 people spoke an indigenous language, 1.1% of the total.

==Education==
There are 456 schools in the borough: 156 preschools, 200 primary schools, 73 secondary schools, 8 vocational high schools and 19 high schools. However, About eighty percent of the population has an education of less than high school level.

Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
*Escuela Preparatoria Venustiano Carranza &quot;José Revueltas Sánchez&quot;

==Socioeconomics==
About 54% of the total population twelve or over is economically active. Most workers are between 35 and 39 years of age. As of 2000, over 98% of the working population was employed in either the formal or informal economies. Just under 80% are employed in commerce, 17.5% are employed in manufacturing and construction and .1% in agriculture.

The number of housing units in the borough has risen from 112200 units with an average occupancy of 3.3 in 1950 to 117800 units with 4.4 occupants in 1990. As of 1995, the average residential building was fifty years old. From 1990 to 2005, the numbers changed only slightly with 118400 units and 3.9 people per household. The improvement has much to with the decreasing population. Sewerage and electricity is available in over 97% of residential units but running water exists in just under 87%. Those without running water in the apartment have shared source of supply.

==Transportation==

===TAPO===

The Terminal de Autobuses de Pasajeros de Oriente, better known as TAPO is the main bus terminal for interstate travel to the east and southeast. It is located next to Metro San Lázaro and marked by its very large dome covering the structure. It was constructed by architect Juan José Díaz Infance and inaugurated in 1978. The outer rim of the circular interior contains ticket counters and boarding areas for bus lines such as Autobuses Unidos. The center contains a food court and other businesses.

===Mexico City airport===
Mexico City International Airport, known officially as Aeropuerto Internacional de Benito Juárez, is the main airport for Mexico City. It was formally named after the 19th century president Benito Juárez in 2006. The airport is owned by Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de México and operated by Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, the government-owned corporation, who also operates 21 others airports through Mexico. It is the country&#x27;s busiest airport with 32 domestic and international airlines and offers direct flights to more than 100 destinations worldwide. In 2010, the airport served 24,130,535 passengers.

Next in importance are Fray Servando Teresa de Mier, Eje 1 Oriente, Eje 2 Oriente (Avenida Congreso de la Unión ), Eje 3 Oriente, Eje 3 Sur, Eje 2 Sur, Eje 1 Norte, and Eje 2 Norte.

The high concentration of people and businesses has resulted in an extensive public transportation network which includes the Mexico City Metro, trolleybuses and various bus lines. The Metro lines that cross the borough are Line 1, Line 4, Line 5, Line 9, and Line B, with thirty six stations within borough limits.

<text>Misantla is a city in the Mexican state of Veracruz, the administrative seat of the municipality &quot;(municipio)&quot; of the same name. The municipality is bordered by Martínez de la Torre, Colipa and Papantla.

Misantla is located in the valley of the Misantla River in the Sierra de Chiconquiaco.

Travelwise, Misantla is about from the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico; however, the roads to the coast are not reliable. Misantla is located two hours north of Xalapa (the capital of the state) on Veracruz State Highway 65, a most scenic mountain route, well-paved. Federal Highways 180 and 129 are on either side of it. Misantla has Pre-Columbian pyramid, located northwest of town.

It is the municipal seat of several different communities such as Morelos, Guerrero, el Pozón, Buenos Aires, Arroyo Hondo, etc. In the local Native American Totonac language it means &quot;place of the deer&quot;, although there are no longer deer in the wild. Misantla is over 450 years old, it was founded by the Spanish conquistadors and the Native population. Weather in Misantla is very hot and humid. The main crops are coffee beans, oranges and corn. Misantla is not only an agricultural community but also people raise cattle for a living. In the city, vendors invaded the pretty streets with street commerce, thus street commerce is another very common activity.

Misantla is also known as &quot;La Tierra del Cachichin&quot; (&quot;land of Cachichin&quot;). Cachichin is a very sour, unpleasant nut which used to be abundant; nowadays, however, the nut is steadily disappearing.

==History==
The region was originally populated by people of the Tajin or Totonaca culture. The Chiconquiaco Codex that records in 1542 the settlement was founded to concentrate and evangelize the natives. On August 25, 1544, the tax that Misantla had to pay in the town of Xalapa was fixed. On January 20, 1564, the day of San Sebastián, the population of San Juan Misantla moved, by decision of the Franciscans who evangelized the region, from the old place to the new one, at the junction of the Palchán and Misantla rivers. Two of the first Catholic evangelists in the region were Toribio de Benavente Motolinia and Fray Buenaventura de Fuenlabrada, who lived in the town of Chapultepec. The new foundation was called Santa María de la Asunción Misantla, although the first church built was dedicated to San Sebastián, being destroyed by a fire in 1565.

Totonacs in the Misantla area as leading growers of high-quality vanilla pods dates from the eighteenth century. 

The body of Baruch Pérez León, commander of the municipal police department, was found near the Martínez de la Torre garbage dump on January 29, 2021. Pérez León had been reported missing the night before, and there were indications he had been tortured before he was shot. Police commanders in San Juan Evangelista and Huatusco had been assassinated in February 2019 and May 2020, respectively.

<doc id="408579" wikidata="Q1452695" url="?curid=408579" title="Long Duration Exposure Facility">
<text>NASA&#x27;s Long Duration Exposure Facility, or LDEF (pronounced &quot;eldef&quot;), was a cylindrical facility designed to provide long-term experimental data on the outer space environment and its effects on space systems, materials, operations and selected spores&#x27; survival. It was placed in low Earth orbit by in April 1984. The original plan called for the LDEF to be retrieved in March 1985, but after a series of delays it was eventually returned to Earth by in January 1990.

It successfully carried science and technology experiments for about 5.7 years that have revealed a broad and detailed collection of space environmental data. LDEF&#x27;s 69 months in space provided scientific data on the long-term effects of space exposure on materials, components and systems that has benefited NASA spacecraft designers to this day.

==History==
Researchers identified the potential of the planned Space Shuttle to deliver a payload to space, leave it there for a long-term exposure to the harsh outer space environment, and retrieve it for analysis on a separate mission. The LDEF concept evolved from a spacecraft proposed by NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center in 1970 to study the meteoroid environment, the Meteoroid and Exposure Module (MEM). The project was approved in 1974 and LDEF was built at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center.

LDEF was intended to be reused, and redeployed with new experiments, perhaps every 18 months. but after the unintended extension of mission 1 the structure itself was treated as an experiment and intensively studied before being placed into storage.

==Launch and deployment==
The STS-41-C crew of deployed LDEF on April 7, 1984, into a nearly circular orbit at an altitude of 257 nautical miles.

==Design and structure==
The LDEF structure shape was a 12 sided prism (to fit the shuttle orbiter payload bay), and made entirely from stainless steel. There were 5 or 6 experiments on each of the 12 long sides and a few more on the ends. It was designed to fly with one end facing earth and the other away from earth. 
Attitude control of LDEF was achieved with gravity-gradient stabilization and inertial distribution to maintain three-axis stability in orbit. Therefore, propulsion or other attitude control systems were not required, making LDEF free of acceleration forces and contaminants from jet firings. There was also a magnetic/viscous damper to stop any initial oscillation after deployment.

It had two grapple fixtures. An FRGF and an active (rigidize sensing) grapple used to send an electronic signal to initiate the 19 experiments that had electrical systems. This activated the Experiment Initiate System (EIS) which sent 24 initiation signals to the 20 active experiments. There were six initiation indications which were visible to the deploying astronauts next to the active grapple fixture.

Engineers originally intended that the first mission would last about one year, and that several long-duration exposure missions would use the same frame. The exposure facility was actually used for a single 5.7-year mission.

== Experiments ==
The LDEF facility was designed to glean information vital to the development of the Space Station Freedom (that was eventually built as the International Space Station) and other spacecraft, especially the reactions of various space building materials to radiation, extreme temperature changes and collisions with space matter.

Some of the experiments had a cover that opened after deployment and was designed to close after about a year, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Space Environment Effects (M0006).

There was no telemetry, but some active experiments recorded data on a magnetic tape recorder that was powered by a lithium sulfur dioxide battery, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the Advanced Photovoltaic Experiment (S0014), which recorded data once a day, the German Solar cell study (S1002), and the Space Environment Effects on Fiber Optics Systems (M004).

Six of the seven active experiments that needed to record data used one or two &quot;Experiment Power and Data System&quot; (EPDS) modules. Each EPDS contained a processing and control module, a magnetic tape recorder and two LiSO2 batteries. One experiment (S0069) used a 4-track magnetic tape module not as part of an EPDS.

Fifty-seven science and technology experiments — involving government and university investigators from the United States, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom — flew on the LDEF mission. Interstellar gases also would be trapped in an attempt to find clues into the formation of the Milky Way and the evolution of heavier elements. Some examples are investigation of exposure effects on:
* materials, coatings, and thermal systems
* power and spacecraft propulsion
* optical fibers and pure crystals for use in electronics
* electronics and optics
* survival of tomato seeds and bacterial spores
and physics in low gravity – e.g. crystal growth.

At least one of the on-board experiments, the Thermal Control Surfaces Experiment (TCSE), used the RCA 1802 microprocessor.

==Experiment results==

===EXOSTACK===
In the German experiment EXOSTACK, 30% of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; spores survived the nearly 6 years exposure to outer space when embedded in salt crystals, whereas 80% survived in the presence of glucose, which stabilize the structure of the cellular macromolecules, especially during vacuum-induced dehydration.

If shielded against solar UV, spores of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data may support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, the so-called lithopanspermia hypothesis.

=== SEEDS ===
The Space Exposed Experiment Developed for Students (SEEDS) allowed students the opportunity to grow control and experimental tomato seeds that had been exposed on LDEF comparing and reporting the results. 12.5 million seeds were flown, and students from elementary to graduate school returned 8000 reports to NASA. The L.A. Times misreported that a DNA mutation from space exposure could yield a poisonous fruit. While incorrect, the report served to raise awareness of the experiment and generate discussion. Space seeds germinated sooner and grew faster than the control seeds. Space seeds were more porous than terrestrial seeds.

==Retrieval==
At LDEF&#x27;s launch, retrieval was scheduled for March 19, 1985, eleven months after deployment. Schedules slipped, postponing the retrieval mission first to 1986, then indefinitely due to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. After 5.7 years its orbit had decayed to about and it was likely to burn up on reentry in a little over a month.

It was finally recovered by on mission STS-32 on January 12, 1990. &quot;Columbia&quot; approached LDEF in such a way as to minimize possible contamination to LDEF from thruster exhaust. While LDEF was still attached to the RMS arm, an extensive 4.5 hour survey photographed each individual experiment tray, as well as larger areas. Nevertheless, shuttle operations did contaminate experiments when concerns for human comfort out-weighed important LDEF mission goals.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base on January 20, 1990. With LDEF still in its bay, &quot;Columbia&quot; was ferried back on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to the Kennedy Space Center on January 26. Special efforts were taken to ensure protection against contamination of the payload bay during the ferry flight.

Between January 30 and 31, LDEF was removed from &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s payload bay in KSC&#x27;s Orbiter Processing Facility, placed in a special payload canister, and transported to the Operations and Checkout Building. On February 1, 1990, LDEF was transported in the LDEF Assembly and Transportation System to the Spacecraft Assembly and Encapsulation Facility – 2, where the LDEF project team led deintegration activities.

<text>Gerald Wesley Moran ( ; born May 29, 1954) is an American lawyer and politician who is the senior United States senator from Kansas, a seat he has held since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he was chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 113th U.S. Congress, during which he led successful Republican efforts in the 2014 election, producing the first Republican Senate majority since 2006. Previously, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing .

Raised in Plainville, Kansas, Moran graduated from the University of Kansas and the University of Kansas School of Law. He worked in private law and was the state special assistant attorney general (1982–1985) and deputy attorney of Rooks County (1987–1995). He served in the Kansas Senate from 1989 to 1997 and was majority leader for his last two years. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1996 and spent seven terms there with little electoral opposition. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010 after defeating fellow U.S. representative Todd Tiahrt in a contentious primary. He was reelected to the Senate in 2016 and 2022.

Moran is the dean of the Kansas congressional delegation.

== Early life, education, and career ==
Moran was born in Great Bend, Kansas, the son of Madeline Eleanor (née Fletcher) and Raymond Edwin &quot;Ray&quot; Moran. He was raised in Plainville. He attended Fort Hays State University before enrolling at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1976. While attending the University of Kansas, he worked as a summer intern for U.S. representative Keith Sebelius in 1974, when impeachment proceedings were being prepared against President Richard Nixon.

Moran worked as a banker before receiving his Juris Doctor from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1982. He practiced law at Stinson, Mag &amp; Fizzell in Kansas City, and later joined Jeter &amp; Larson Law Firm in Hays, where he practiced for 15 years. In addition to his law practice, he served as the state special assistant attorney general (1982–1985) and deputy county attorney of Rooks County (1987–1995). He also served as an adjunct professor of political science at Fort Hays State University.

== Kansas Senate ==
Moran served eight years (1989–1997) in the Kansas Senate. He served two years as the vice president and his last two years as majority leader.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
Moran was elected to Congress in 1996 and reelected six times, never facing serious opposition in the conservative 1st district. In 2006, his opponent was John Doll, against whom he received almost 79% of the vote—one of the highest totals for a Republican congressional incumbent in that election.

=== Tenure ===
During his time in the House of Representatives, Moran conducted an annual town hall meeting in each of the 69 counties in Kansas&#x27;s &quot;Big First&quot; Congressional District. He continues the tradition in the U.S. Senate for all 105 counties.

As a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee, Moran worked with colleagues to craft legislation to aid Kansas farms and ranches. He was also an active member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, where he served as chair of the Subcommittee on Health.

&quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s David Weigel wrote that, despite his insistence that earmarks are a way to get members of Congress to vote for spending &quot;we can&#x27;t afford&quot;, Moran requested $19.4 million in earmarks in the 2010 budget.

== U.S. Senate ==

=== Elections ===
Moran became the Republican nominee for the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Kansas after defeating Representative Todd Tiahrt in the Republican primary, 50% to 45%. In the general election, Moran defeated Democrat Lisa Johnston, Libertarian Michael Dann, and Reform Party candidate Joe Bellis, with 70% of the vote.

===Tenure===

Moran was elected chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 113th U.S. Congress on November 14, 2012. He oversaw the Republican gain of nine Senate seats in the 2014 United States Senate elections, resulting in the first Republican Senate majority since 2006.

On January 5, 2021, Moran announced that he would vote to certify the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, which was to take place the following day. He was participating in the certification when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. During the attack, Moran tweeted that he condemned &quot;the violence and destruction at the U.S. Capitol in the strongest possible terms. It is completely unacceptable and unpatriotic.&quot;

For his tenure as the chairman of the Senate Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee in the 116th Congress, Moran earned an &quot;F&quot; grade from the nonpartisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index. In 2025, amid attempts by Elon Musk&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency&#x27;s attempts to fire probationary workers in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Moran said he was asking whether the firing of VA workers would affect services for veterans. He said, &quot;We’ve been reassured that it doesn’t affect direct care, but we’re looking for more information.&quot;

=== Agriculture ===

In March 2019, Moran was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to United States secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers &quot;have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices&quot; and urging his department to &quot;strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program.&quot;

In May 2019, Moran was a cosponsor of the Transporting Livestock Across America Safely Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Ben Sasse and Jon Tester intended to reform hours of service for livestock haulers by authorizing drivers to have the flexibility to rest at any point during their trip without it being counted against their hours of service and exempting loading and unloading times from the hours of service calculation of driving time.

=== Health care ===
Moran opposed the Medicare reform package of 2003, unlike most congressmen from rural districts. He also opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

In May 2011, Moran sponsored S. 1058, the Pharmacy Competition and Consumer Choice Act of 2011. In the House, he served as co-chair of the House Rural Health Care Coalition and co-founder of the Congressional Community Pharmacy Coalition.

Moran voted against the July 2017 Senate health care bill. He criticized the closed-door process for developing the bill and criticized the legislation for not repealing the entire ACA.

=== National security and military ===

Since 2014, Moran has served on the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors.

In the early 2000s, Moran opposed a timetable for military withdrawal from Iraq.

Since entering Congress, Moran has traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to visit deployed American forces and meet with foreign leaders. His most recent trip to the region was in August 2017 to the northern regions of Afghanistan.In March 2018, Moran was one of five Republican senators to vote against tabling a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required President Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda. In October 2018, Moran was one of seven senators to sign a letter to United States secretary of state Mike Pompeo expressing that they found it &quot;difficult to reconcile known facts with at least two&quot; of the Trump administration&#x27;s certifications that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were attempting to protect Yemen civilians and were in compliance with U.S. laws on arms sales, citing their lack of understanding for &quot;a certification that the Saudi and Emirati governments are complying with applicable agreements and laws regulating defense articles when the [memo] explicitly states that, in certain instances, they have not done so.&quot; In June 2019, Moran was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump&#x27;s Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales.

In January 2019, Moran was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to block Trump&#x27;s intent to lift sanctions against three Russian companies.

In February 2019, amid a report by the Commerce Department that ZTE had been caught illegally shipping goods of American origin to Iran and North Korea, Moran was one of seven senators to sponsor a bill reimposing sanctions on ZTE in the event that ZTE did not honor both American laws and its agreement with the Trump administration.

In July 2019, Moran was one of 16 Republican senators to send a letter to acting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director Russell Vought, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin encouraging them to work with them to prevent a continuing resolution &quot;for FY 2020 that would delay the implementation of the President&#x27;s National Defense Strategy (NDS) and increase costs&quot; and writing that the yearlong continuing resolution suggested by administration officials would render the Defense Department &quot;incapable of increasing readiness, recapitalizing our force, or rationalizing funding to align with the National Defense Strategy (NDS).&quot;

===Immigration and refugees===
Moran critiqued Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order imposing a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, &quot;While I support thorough vetting, I do not support restricting the rights of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Furthermore, far-reaching national security policy should always be devised in consultation with Congress and relevant government agencies.&quot;

In March 2019, Moran was one of 12 Republican senators to vote to block Trump&#x27;s national emergency declaration that would have granted him access to $3.6 billion in military construction funding to build border barriers.

=== Economy ===
In May 2019, Moran was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Global Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing Act, a bill that would develop new institutes that supported American manufacturing in technology and grant more federal investment in the national network such as preexisting institutes being made to compete globally as well as continue American economic and national security.

=== Education ===
Moran supports accountability metrics for public schools, but believes federal initiatives need to provide flexibility to states. In 2001, Moran voted against the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) because he felt it did not afford sufficient flexibility to schools. In 2017, Moran voted to confirm Betsy DeVos as United States Secretary of Education.

===Gun policy===
Moran has an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) for his consistent support of pro-gun policies. The NRA endorsed him in his 2010 Senate run. NRA-Political Victory Fund chair Chris W. Cox called Moran a &quot;steadfast supporter of our freedom&quot;. Since 1998, the NRA has donated $23,850 to Moran&#x27;s political efforts.

In 2013, Moran joined other Republicans in saying they would filibuster any Democrat&#x27;s proposals that Republicans considered a threat to the Second Amendment. In April, he voted against the Manchin-Toomey proposal for universal background checks for gun purchases.

Moran supports the concept of eliminating gun-free zones on military installations and recruitment centers. He said that they are an &quot;infringement on the constitutional rights of our service members&quot; and that gun-free zones make military sites &quot;increasingly vulnerable to those who wish to do harm.&quot;

In 2016, Moran voted against the Feinstein Amendment, which would have banned suspected terrorists from acquiring guns.

Moran responded to the 2017 Olathe, Kansas shooting: &quot;I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia.&quot;

In January 2019, Moran was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state&#x27;s laws.

===Environment and climate change===
As of 2017, based on his environment-related votes, Moran had a lifetime score of 8% from the League of Conservation Voters, and a 0% score for 2016.

In 2015 Moran voted against a Senate amendment acknowledging that human activity contributes to climate change. In 2016, Moran and several other Senate Republicans signed a letter calling upon the U.S. to withdraw funding from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In 2009, Moran voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), which would have established a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

Moran is a strong supporter of the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. During the consideration of the Keystone XL pipeline legislation, he introduced an amendment to remove the lesser prairie chicken from the list of threatened species. The amendment failed on a 54–44 vote, having failed to get the required 60 votes.

===Entrepreneurship and startups===
Moran is &quot;one of the most active members of Congress when it comes to reaching out to Silicon Valley.&quot; In 2014, Consumer Electronics Association President and CEO Gary J. Shapiro dubbed Moran &quot;Mr. Innovation&quot; and described him as &quot;one of the biggest tech entrepreneurship leaders in the U.S. Senate.&quot; Moran is the lead sponsor of Startup Act 3.0 legislation, which includes several provisions that would reform the American visa system for high-skilled, American-educated, and entrepreneurial immigrants. Moran also sponsored the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, also known as the JOBS Act, legislation to expand crowdfunding options for startups. Since its 2012 passage, he has criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s JOBS Act rule-making as drawn out and potentially counterproductive to the legislation&#x27;s intent. Moran is an advocate of increased engagement between Washington and the Startup community and has spoken on the issue at events like South by Southwest (SXSW) and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).

===Internet issues===
Moran opposed the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). In November 2011, Moran, senators Rand Paul, Ron Wyden and Maria Cantwell sent a letter to Senate leadership indicating they would place a Senate hold on PIPA, citing the threats PIPA (and SOPA) posed to liberty and innovation.

In 2017, Moran voted to repeal FCC Internet privacy rules that blocked internet providers from sharing or selling data on customers&#x27; private data (such as browsing history) without the customer&#x27;s permission.

=== Abortion ===
Moran opposes abortion. He has cosponsored legislation to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. He voted in favor of making harming a fetus a crime. Moran supported the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, agreeing that the Constitution does not ensure right to an abortion.

=== LGBT rights ===
The Human Rights Campaign has rated his voting record on LGBT rights as zero in five separate scorecards.

=== Opioids ===
In September 2018, Moran voted for a package of 70 Senate bills that cost $8.4 billion and altered programs across multiple agencies, as part of a bipartisan effort to prevent opioids from being shipped through the U.S. Postal Service and to grant doctors the ability to prescribe medications designed to wean opioid addictions.

===SafeSport===
In February 2022, on a &quot;Nightline&quot; program about criticisms of the United States Center for SafeSport titled &quot;Sports misconduct watchdog faces crisis of confidence&quot;, Moran said that every athlete-victim he visited with &quot;had little or no confidence in SafeSport.&quot; He and Senator Richard Blumenthal said that they believe that more transparency is required from SafeSport, which does not make public its investigative findings or arbitration decisions, to protect young athletes, and that SafeSport must make its work public.

===January 6 commission===
On May 28, 2021, Moran voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

== Personal life ==
Moran lived in Hays for most of his political career. In 2012, he moved to Manhattan to be closer to a major airport in order to cut down on his drive time back to Kansas each weekend. The nearest airport to Hays is Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, three hours southeast; Manhattan is two hours from Wichita and Kansas City. Additionally, Manhattan Regional Airport has direct jet service daily to and from Chicago and Dallas.

At Kansas State University, he was initiated into Alpha Tau Omega on September 28, 2013.

Moran volunteers his time with several community organizations.

The borough was created in 1928, centered on and named after a formerly independent municipality within the then Federal District, which already had governing authority over a number of surrounding communities. The modern borough is made up of 15 “barrios” or neighborhoods, considered to be part of city of Iztapalapa, and 18 other “pueblos” or communities outside of it. To distinguish the original city of Iztapalapa from the rest of the borough, it was officially named Iztapalapa de Cuitláhuac in 2006 in honor of the tenth Aztec emperor. However, eight of the barrios are considered to be the historic center of the city of Iztapalapa, which are La Asunción, San Ignacio, Santa Barbara, San Lucas, San Pablo, San Miguel, San Pedro and San José. 

Records of the “eight barrios of Iztapalapa” go back at least until 1898. Borough authorities have sought “Barrios Mágicos Turísticos” (Magical Tourism Neighborhoods) status for these, for a program similar to the “Pueblos Mágicos” tourism program run by the federal government. The goal is to attract visitors to these neighborhoods as well as other landmarks of the borough such as the Cerro de la Estrella, Pueblo Culhuacán, the Churubusco Gardens, La Magdalena Atlazolpa, Los Reyes, San Antonio Culhuacán, Mexicalzingo, the San Lorenzo Cemetery, San Andrés Tetepilco and San José Aculco.

==Elevation and climate==

The borough has an average elevation of asl and extends over firm land and what was former lake bed of Lake Texcoco. Some of the firm land is alluvial plain but most of it are elevations such as the Cerro de la Estrella ( asl), Peñón Viejo or Peñon del Marqués ( asl), and the Sierra de Santa Catalina, which contains the Cerro Tecuatzi ( asl), Cerro Tetecón ( asl), and the Guadalupe Borrego ( asl), Xaltepec ( asl); and Yuhualixqui ( asl) volcanoes. These are recent geological formations, with evidence of lava flow still existent and none extend over above the valley floor. Culturally, the most important of these elevations is the Cerro de la Estrella, which was the site of the New Fire ceremony. Since the pre-Hispanic period, Lake Texcoco has been drained, leaving behind only two natural river called the Churubusco and La Piedad, which unite to form the Unido River, and a few canals. However, the rivers are confined to large pipes as is one of the canals, and most of the Canal Nacional which forms part of the border of the borough has been filled in to create Calzada La Viga road. For this reason, there are no longer any naturally occurring surface water. 

The climate of the area is divided into four zones. One consists of a warm wet climate with temperatures above in the coldest months. Another is a temperate wet climate with temperatures between in the coldest months. One has a relatively dry climate with a range of temperatures, and the last consists of a cold climate with average temperature not exceeding . Most of the area falls into the temperate category and all receive most of their rainfall in the summer and early fall.

==Urbanization==

Uncontrolled population growth in the area has nearly wiped out all forms of wildlife in the borough, although as late as the 1960s, there were still a number of waterfowl to be found. Animals found here now are pets or the few cases in which families still raise domestic fowl, rabbits and others for food. Almost all of the borough (90%) is urbanized, with only six percent designated as ecological reserve, concentrated in two parks, the Cerro de la Estrella National Park and the Sierra de Santa Catarina, declared a reserve in 1994. However, both of these areas are under pressure by the continued urbanization and population growth of the area.

Iztapalapa and most of the east side of the Federal District was historically rural and poor up until the mid-20th century. Large-scale urbanization and industrialization began in the 1950s, along with high rates of migration into the borough in the 1970s. Today, it has high population density, limited infrastructure and high levels of socio economic marginalization. Social problems include homelessness, unregulated street vending, illegal building and crimes associated with the sex trade. Many live in rundown housing with deficient municipal services. The exception to this are the areas that border the boroughs of Benito Juárez, Coyoacán and Iztacalco. As of 2010, about 30% of the borough&#x27;s buildings still have damage from the 1985 earthquake. Most are located in the Peñon Viejo, Ermita Zaragoza, Santa Martha Acatitla, Santa Cruz Meyehualco, El Molino, San Lorenzo and La Hera areas, with about 150,000 damaged homes. Over 95% of the homes in the borough have electricity, running water and sewerage, and the borough provides sufficient educational services and other services such as sports facilities; however, the high population density means that the five or less percent equals a large number of people without sufficient services.

===Crime===
Primary problems facing the borough include crime, especially drug trafficking and sale of stolen auto parts, and also lack of water supply. Iztapalpa has the highest rates of rape, violence against women, and domestic violence in Mexico City. Most crime is connected with small scale drug trafficking, which is becoming more frequent on the borough&#x27;s streets. Between 2008 and 2010, there were 470 murders in the borough, two out of ten for all of Mexico City, with one occurring every two days. It also has one of the highest rates of muggings and robberies of taxi drivers and public buses. Most of the crime problems are concentrated into a group of neighborhoods, such as Santa Martha Acatitla Norte, Desarrollo Urbano Quetzalcoatl, Tenorios, La Polvorilla, Santa Cruz Meyehualco, San Miguel Teotongo, Xalpa, Lomas Estrella, Lonas de Zaragoza and Achualtepec. This area has over 100 known points where drugs are sold. Its proximity to municipalities such as Nezahualcoyotl in the State of Mexico allows criminals to escape jurisdiction easily. However, the borough reports that crime rates diminished 5.41% from 2009 to 2010. Basic services, especially potable water, is lacking in many of these same areas, which are close to the Sierra de Santa Catalina where there is no piped water service; rather it is delivered in trucks to home storage tanks. Sometimes the wait for these trucks can last hours, and there have been hijackings of water delivery trucks. About 96% of homes in the borough do have piped-in water, but about 500,000 residents have insufficient supplies, low pressure and in many places the water quality is visibly poor. Visibly dirty water is locally called “agua de tamarindo” (tamarind water) because of its brown color.


==Landmarks==

The borough is home to a number of historic churches, many of which were built in the colonial era. The Franciscans built monasteries and churches in communities such as Huitzilopohco, San Marcos Mexicaltzingo, Santa Marta, and Nativitas Tepetlacingo. Most of these churches, especially those of San Lucas Evangelista, San Marcos Mexicaltzingo, San Juan Evangelista and the chapels of Calvario and Santa Martha Acatitla were built over foundations of pre Hispanic temples, which had been destroyed in the Conquest. The main parish church building of the city of Iztapalapa dates from at least 1664. Its main entrance contains various indigenous symbols. Some churches, however, were built later, such as the Asunción de María parish church built in 1890, and the current San Juan Evangelista church built between 1880 and 1897.

The two most important religious establishments have been Señor de la Cuevita Sanctuary and the former monastery of Culhuacán. The Señor de la Cuevita Sanctuary is located on Avenida Morelos and 16 de Septiembre in the city of Iztapalapa. It was built to house an image of Christ made of cornstalks which is called the “Señor de la Cuevita” (Lord of the Small Cave). According to legend, this image was taken from here to Etla, Oaxaca, but it mysteriously disappeared from there to reappear in a small cave back in Iztapalapa. However, its importance stems from a miracle attributed to it. In 1833, the area was hit by the 1826–1837 cholera pandemic. People appealed to this image and when the plague dissipated, this image was given credit. Yearly rites of gratitude to this image eventually developed into the borough&#x27;s annual Passion Play. Since 1853, this church has been the center of most indigenous dance held. This is because in that year the archbishop of Mexico forbade “pagan” dances and to avoid confrontation, the dances began to be held here in the main atrium. In 1875, the church was painted by Anacleto Escutia.

The most important monastery founded in the area in the colonial period was in Culhuacán by the Augustinians. This monastery was begun in 1552 and dedicated to John the Baptist. The Augustinians founded a school to teach indigenous languages which operated for over 100 years. It was also a center of paper making, taking advantage of springs and canals for water. The original church of the monastery was demolished a long time ago, but parts of the original complex still remain. The original church was replaced in the late 19th century by the San Juan Evangelista parish church, built between 1880 and 1897. The rest of the complex has been secularized since the 19th century and declared a national monument in 1944. From 1960 to 1984, it was occupied by INAH, which renovated it. Today, this complex is home to the Museo del Exconvento de Culhuacán (Museum of the Former Monastery of Culhuacán), inaugurated in 1987. The grounds around it are referred to as the Parque Historico y Centro comunitario Culhuacán (Culhuacán Historic Park and Community Center). The park contains an artificial pond and areas planted with native trees such as ahuejotes. The monastery complex itself still contains a number of frescos on its walls, and its library is still an important cultural and research center. A number of the old monks’ cells now contain exhibits related to the institution.
The Cerro de la Estrella National Park was established in 1938 and is considered to be the most important natural area in the eastern part of the Valley of Mexico. The park covers over and was established for recreational and cultural purposes. The hill (cerro) was the site of the Aztec New Fire ceremony, last performed in 1507. The park is also culturally important due to the annual Passion Play which is partially conducted on the summit of the cerro each year. The area is managed by the Secretaría de Agricultura y Recursos Hidráulicos, but it lost its original forest cover due to over-cutting of trees. The ecosystem now on the site consists only of planted eucalyptus and Pinus patula trees, along with insects and rodents. There are also problems with illegal building and farming in areas.

The Museo Fuego Nuevo (New Fire Museum) was built by architect David Peña and inaugurated in 1998. The museum is dedicated to the history of the site, especially as related by the Fuego Nuevo Codex. There is evidence of the hill&#x27;s ritual use going back 4,000 years; however, the New Fire Ceremony was Aztec. Every 52 years ended one cycle and began another. The worry, however, was that the sun would not return and the ceremony was designed to ensure the sun&#x27;s return in the morning. Excavation of this site and others in the borough was begun in 1974 by INAH. This work has also uncovered fossilized human and mammoth remains in neighborhoods such as Santa María Aztahuacán and Santa Marta Acatitlán.
The Museo Cabeza de Juárez was constructed in 1976. This museum in Colonia Agua Prieta is an enormous multicolored monument of Benito Juárez’s head that measures in height and weighs six tons. It was decorated by David Alfaro Siqueiros but he died before he could finish the work. His brother-in-law, Luis Arenal Bastar completed it. The work is considered to be a fusion of painting, sculpting, engineering and architecture. Today, it contains a number of abstract murals, a permanent collection of lithographs and a large auditorium. The monument is a symbol of the eastern part of the city.

The Central de Abasto (Groceries Center) is Mexico City&#x27;s main wholesale market for produce and other foodstuffs. It was constructed to be the meeting point for producers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers for the entire country. The site accommodates more than 250,000 people each day and provides foodstuffs for most of the people of Mexico City area. The facility extends over and is the most important commercial center for the city. It is the largest such market in Latin America. It was established in the 1970s, over what were the remaining chinampa farming plots in the borough, effectively eliminating this tradition in this part of the city. The main building was inaugurated in 1982, built by Abraham Zabludovesky, as a slightly deformed hexagon measuring across. It was built to take over from the La Merced Market, which was no longer large enough to meet the city&#x27;s needs for the wholesale distribution of produce and other foodstuffs.

The borough is also home to Mexico City and Mexico&#x27;s largest fish market, called La Nueva Viga, in Colonia San José Aculco on Prologación Eje 6 Sur. With 202 wholesalers and 165 retail outlets, it distributes about 60% of the country&#x27;s seafood production along with much of what is imported. The market begins business at 4:00 a.m., when delivery trucks bring in fresh fish from all over Mexico to the vendors. This daily delivery is about 500 tons and includes all kinds of seafood from shrimp to fish to shellfish to small sharks and manta rays. The main fish market is here due to Mexico City&#x27;s role as economic center since the pre Hispanic period.

The twice-weekly El Salado tianguis or street market offers everything from the cheapest used items to luxury items can be found.
The Fábrica de Artes y Oficios Oriente was inaugurated in 2000, located between the two largest apartment complexes of the borough, the Iztapalapa and the Unidad Vicente Guerrero. It contains a forum for 800 people, lobby with two wings for expositions and workshops. Classes are given in guitar, dance, candlemaking, ceramics, and sewing. There is also an area for major event which can hold 1,500 people.

The community museum of San Miguel Teotongo on the highway to Puebla contains finds related to the ancient inhabitants of the area. Most relate to the pre-Hispanic period and include utensils, ceremonial objects, ceramics, obsidian blades and arrowheads and jewelry.

The Museo de Hidrobiologia (Hydrobiology Museum) mostly contains preserved example of the various species found in the different types of water found in Mexico. These include rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, beach areas as well as reefs offshore.

The current borough government building, or “palacio delegacional” were inaugurated in 1989. It contains a mural by Francisco Cárdenas done in 2003 called “Iztapalapa: Ayer, Hoy y Siempre” (Iztapalapa: Yesterday, Today and Always).

The borough contains two large penal institutions called the Centro de Ejecución de Sanciones Penales Varonil Oriente and the Centro de Readaptación Social Varonil Santa Martha Acatitla. The Centro de Ejecución de Sanciones Penales Varonil Oriente (Center for the Execution of Penal Sanctions for Men East), more commonly called the Reclusorio Oriente (East Prison) was inaugurated in 1987 for adult males. The building extends over a surface in colonial San Lorenzo Tezonco. It contains five dormitories, intake center, workshops, sports facilities and classrooms. The Centro de Readaptación Social Varonil Santa Martha Acatitla (Center for Male Social Readaptation Santa Martha Acatitla) is for juvenile males which was inaugurated in 2003. It has a maximum population of 672 housed in four buildings with basketball court, dining hall, workshops, classrooms and computer room. A new building is under construction to bring the capacity up to 900 inmates.

==Transportation==

For most of the borough&#x27;s history, most transportation of people and freight was done on the waters of the lake and through canals. However, these began to dry up starting in the 19th century. They remained important up until the early 20th century, with even steamships passing through at one time. In the 1930s, many of the barrios of Iztapalapa were still marked by canals and still grew vegetables, fruits and flowers. Eventually, major traffic was confined mostly to the Canal Nacional. As the canals dried up, newer modes of transportation were introduced. In 1903, mule-drawn trolleys were introduced into the municipality to link it Mexico City via Jamaica. These trolleys would be used to bring Mexican president Francisco I. Madero to celebrate his inauguration in 1912. Several train lines linked the area to other parts of Mexico by 1922. The first bus services between the center of Mexico City and the large market was begun in 1952.

Today, most transportation in the borough is on various roadways via public or private vehicle. Main avenues include Calzada Ermita-Iztapalapa, Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza, Calzada Benito Juárez, Calzada La Viga, Anillo Periférico Norte, Circuito Interior, Avenida Tláhuac, Avenida Plutarco Elias Calles. The “Eje” road system in the area includes Eje 3 Sur, Eje 4 Sur, Eje 5 Sur, Eje 6 Sur, Eje7 Sur, Eje 8 Sur, Eje 2 Oriente, Eje 3 Oriente, Eje 4 Oriente and Eje 5 Oriente. The main highway leaving Mexico City towards Puebla cuts through the borough. Each day about 80,000 vehicles pass through, making it the second busiest highway section in Mexico City. Many of these are local and intercity buses which can block two out of the three lanes. Construction work has been done to widen the highway, but political disputes have kept new lanes from opening as of early 2011. Public transportation includes several trolleybus lines, busses, taxis and bicitaxis. Line 8 and Line A of the Metro also pass through the borough.

==Demographics==
With a population of 1,815,768 as of the 2010 census, Iztapalapa is the most populous and fastest growing borough in Mexico City. It is also the most populous locality (&quot;localidad&quot;) in Mexico, larger than Ecatepec de Morelos or Guadalajara. Until the mid-20th century, the area was rural, but migration into the borough began in the 1970s as this is the only area with significant land that could be developed. From 1970 to 1980, it accounted for 54.3% of the city&#x27;s population increase. From 1980 to 1990, Iztapalapa gained 341,988, more than 1.6 times that of the rest of the city. Most of the migration came from families leaving the center of the city, but more importantly many migrants from other parts of Mexico into the city settled in the relatively cheap Iztapalapa. In the last decades, the population increase of the borough has accounted for 83% of the population growth of Mexico City. Today, the population of the borough accounts for over 20.5% of Federal District’s total. The population growth has slowed somewhat, but at its peak in the 1990s, it was over 100%. This population growth has spurred the location of most of the city&#x27;s housing projects of the last decades in this area. The borough&#x27;s population is still expected to increase at a rate of 0.77%. While migration into the borough is significant, there is very little migration out into other parts of Mexico or abroad.

Most of the borough&#x27;s residents are poor to middle class, with a very large percentage of youth. Just over 42% of the population is considered to be socioeconomically marginalized, meaning there are fully or partially excluded from social and/or municipal services of one type or another. While this is not the highest level of all the boroughs, since Iztapalapa has the highest population by a significant margin, most of the city&#x27;s marginalized are here with just under 9% of Mexico City&#x27;s total. The population between 0 and 19 years of age represents about 40% of the total. Next are those between 20 and 34, who account for about 29% of the total. A large percentage of the population of the borough is under 15 at 36.4%, with only 7.6% over 50.

===Languages===
During the colonial period into the 19th century, Iztapalapa was mostly indigenous, with small population of European descent and mestizos. Migration into the area eventually would change the ethnic composition to primarily mestizo and the Nahuatl language would essentially disappear. As of 2005, only about two percent of the population speaks an indigenous language, with 94.8% bilingual in Spanish as well. This is about equal to the city average. However, the borough contains about 25% of the total ethnic indigenous of the city. Most of the indigenous languages found in the borough are those associated with the state of Oaxaca, such as Zapotec, Mixteca and Chatina. Oaxacan languages account for 34.9% of the total. Uto-Aztecan languages account for 23.32% which include Tarahumara, Mayo, Yaqui, Cora and Huichol. Another significant percentage are those of the Oto-Pamean languages which include Otomi, Mazahua and Matlatzinca.The only language which has been spoken in Mexico not represented in Iztapalapa is Kickapoo.

===Religion===
The overwhelming majority of the population is Catholic, although this has declined by 1.9% since the 1990s. Protestant and Evangelical sects have grown to about 6% of the population, with less than 2% professing no faith.

===Education===
The first public primary school classes in Iztapalapa were established in 1914 under the government of Venustiano Carranza at Escuela Enrique Laubscher and in the San Lucas Church. However, during the government of Lázaro Cárdenas, many in the borough refused to send their children to school, afraid that they would be indoctrinated against the Catholic faith. Today, the borough has sufficient educational infrastructure, with most schools belonging to the primary level. There are a number of institutions of higher education such as UAM, and the Facultad de Estudios Superiores Zaragoza of UNAM. There are 452 preschools, 612 primary schools, 191 middle schools, 21 vocational schools, 35 high schools, and two teachers’ colleges. Ninety-five percent of children between five and nine years of age attend school, with 96% of those between 10 and 14. Only 62% of those between 15 and 19 attend school and 27% of those between 20 and 24. About 4% of the population above the age of six is illiterate with 63% of this number being female. The highest rates of illiteracy are in the 65 and older age group.

Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
*Escuela Preparatoria Iztapalapa I
*Escuela Preparatoria Iztapalapa II &quot;Benito Juárez&quot;
*Escuela Preparatoria Iztapalapa III &quot;Miravalles&quot;
*Escuela Preparatoria Iztapalapa IV

The Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana was established in 1974 with three campuses in Azcapotzalco, Xochimilco and Iztapalapa. Iztapalapa was constructed first and covers an area of . Most of the institution&#x27;s research work is conducted at the Iztapalapa campus. Other institutions include the University Autónoma dela Ciudad de México, San Lorenzo Campus and the Instituto Tecnológico de Iztapalapa.

==Economy==
The two most important economic activities in the borough are manufacturing and commerce. Sixty-three percent of all business establishments are dedicated to commerce, which employ 42% of the people and accounts for 45% of the borough&#x27;s GDP. Commerce and services together employ 63.3% of the population. Twenty-four percent of this commerce is wholesale, much of which is tied to the Central de Abasto and the La Nueva Viga markets. However, wholesale businesses have declined 2.8% while retail establishment have increased 8.1%. This has a positive effect on employment, but this activity adds less to the GDP. The largest sector of retail sales is in street markets called tianguis, followed by public markets, street peddlers and lastly through the Central de Abasto.

A total of 32.5% is employed in industry, minerals and construction. Industry includes food processing, bottling, tobacco products, metals, machinery, surgical equipment, paper and printing and textiles. Only 0.3% is now employed in agriculture or livestock.

==Culture==

===Passion Play===

The Passion Play of Iztapalapa has its origin in an outbreak of cholera in 1833, which left many dead and many children orphaned. A procession was performed to an image of Christ called the “Señor de la Cuevita” (Lord of the Little Cave) to end the epidemic. When it subsided, it was considered a miracle and various cults to this Christ figure appeared. Expressions of gratitude to this figure eventually consolidated into two annual events. The first is a Mass in honor of these images, now known as the Fiesta de Solteras de Septiembre. The second is the annual Passion Play.

The Passion Play is considered to be part of “folk religion,” supported by clergy but not considered to be liturgy. The Passion Play has antecedents in the plays put on by evangelizers to teach the Catholic faith and to get the indigenous to renounce their former beliefs. However, the passion play incorporates areas which were special or sacred to the pre Hispanic world, including the gardens that once belonged to the emperor Cuitláhuac and the hill on which the New Fire ceremony was performed. The Passion Play started as a number of reenactment events held in a number of places in the borough during Lent and Holy Week, including a procession with the Señor de la Cuevita on the fifth Friday of Lent. However, by the early 20th century, one main passion play for the borough had come into existence. According to one local legend, Emiliano Zapata lent his horses for the 1914 version of the play.

Since that time, this Passion Play has become a major event with the participation of 450 actors and attended by 2 million people over the course of the week and 2,000 police to provide security. This includes people from other parts of Mexico, from abroad and from the media. It is the most crowded and best known of its type in Mexico. The most crowded day is Good Friday, but as many as 40,000 are expected on Palm Sunday at the start of the event. The reenactments start on Palm Sunday and last until Easter Sunday with various Biblical scenes related to the life and death of Jesus played out. The most important episodes include the blessing of the palms on Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday in the Cuitláhuac Garden, and Good Friday, with the sentencing, the crown of thorns and the crucifixion. At the Señor de la Cuevita Sanctuary, the scene of the expulsion of the money changers from the temple is re enacted. The Palm Sunday procession proceeds then to the Casa de la Mayordomía in the San Miguel barrio followed by hundreds dressed as Nazarenes and thousands more spectators. After the death of Jesus is played out, the “body” is lowered and taken to the Cuitláhuac Plaza where it is “buried” and “guarded” by people playing Roman soldiers. In 2010, the Passion Play was submitted to UNESCO to become an intangible cultural heritage.

Most Iztapalapa residents seek roles but not all are selected. The most coveted role is that of Jesus, which is selected each year by the Comité Organizador de Iztapalapa. Next is the role of the Virgin Mary. These are reserved for single young people, who do not have children, addictions, tattoos and can demonstrate their Catholic faith. The role of Jesus requires physical conditioning to carry the cross, which weight about 198 pounds. For a year, the chosen Jesus exercises daily as well as prays to prepare physically and spiritually. The Passion and Death are played out at the Cerro de la Estrella, emulating Calvary. The man playing Jesus must carry the cross from the center of Iztapalapa to the summit of the Cerro de las Estrellas to be crucified. The day after Easter Sunday the selection committee meets to choose the next Jesus and Mary.

While this Passion Play is the best known, events related to Holy Week take place in all parts and parishes of the borough including other re-enactments done by children as well as smaller events in Santiago Acahualtepec and Culhuacán which are more recent. Prisoners at the hold their own Passion Play with the involvement of about 80 people.

===Nuevo Fuego Festival===
The Festival del Fuego Nuevo (New Fire Festival) is an annual event held in November/December with events such as music, dance, theatre, cinema and art exhibitions. This event is named after the Aztec New Fire ceremony, which was celebrated every 52 years at the summit of the Cerro de la Estrella hill. This was a solemn ceremony when all fires were extinguished with a “new fire” ignited at night to provoke the return of the sun in the morning as well as the mark the beginning of a new 52-year cycle on the Aztec calendar. This “new fire” would then be distributed among the populace. The last ancient ceremony was held in 1507. While named for the ancient New Fire ceremony, the modern version is a cultural festival dedicated to the area&#x27;s culture past and present. The festival is divided into four “axis” called “Traditions of the Ancient Mexicans,” “The Footsteps of Zapata,” “Sounds of the Underworld” and New Fire and Mexican Contemporary Cinema.”

===Carnivals===
Various neighborhoods hold celebrations for Carnival, which mostly consists of costumed groups, dance, live music and parades. These communities come together to hold a finale at the end of Carnival.

===Other events===
To celebrate the Christmas season, the borough sponsors various activities such as Christmas plays, processions “posadas” as well as cultural events such as dance recitals.

==History==
=== Pre-colonial period ===
The borough is named after a city which was founded here in the pre-Hispanic period. &quot;Iztapalapa&quot; comes from Nahuatl and means &quot;in the waters of the banks,&quot; referring to its position along the lakeshore, situated partly on dry land and partly over water

Like the pre-Hispanic villages of Xochimilco and Tláhuac, Iztapalapa began as a village on the shores of the lake system and dedicated to farming on chinampas. The first settlements on this side of Lake Texcoco were formed by refugees from the fall of Teotihuacan at the base of the Cerro de Culhuacán hill. These people were led by a chief named Mixcoatl and would become known as the Culhuas. At that time, the area was a peninsula jutting onto the lake formed by the Sierra de Santa Catarina. The first city on this peninsula was Culhuacán on the south side next to the Cerro de la Estrella, which grew to contain various neighborhoods surrounded by chinampas, or artificial islands in the lake used to grow food. These and the exploitation of lake resources was the basis of the city&#x27;s economy.

Chinampa agriculture would be important in many areas of the Valley of Mexico, including the area of Iztapalapa. Chinampas here were made from reeds, tree branches and lake mud, growing corn, beans and wide variety of vegetables. These chinampas, now known as neighborhoods called Tezontitla, El Bordo, El Moral, Las Largas, Las Cuadradas, Tecorrales, Zapotla and others were separated by small canals and some of them had docks. They were also an ecosystem home to wide variety of land and aquatic flora and fauna, including storks, flowers, trees, reeds, quetzals, frogs, and fish. The chinampas remained in private hands until 1970, when they were expropriated to construct the Central de Abasto, which eliminated them.
Culhuacan was moved to a site called Tollantzingo in the 950s, and shortly after that migrants from Tula came into the area to settle as well, bringing with them the worship of Quetzalcoatl. Other pre-Hispanic settlements in the Iztapalapa area were established and grew as well, including Hitzilopochco (Churubusco), Mexicaltzingo and Iztapalapa. These would be the four main settlements of the area, with close relations that would last into the colonial era, when they were part of the Mexicaltzingo corregimiento. The village of Iztapalapa has its origins in the fall of Teotihuacan in the 8th century. Ancient Iztapalapa has alliances and disputes mostly with the other dominions with economies based on chinampas, such as Xochimilco, Chalco and Mixquic. 

By the 11th century, the Toltec descendants had become dominant with the area with Culhuacán becoming the capital of a dominion in 1114. The main rulers of this city included Nauhyotl, Cuauhtexpetlatzin, Huetzin, Nonoalcatle and Cuauhtonal who ruled between 1120 and 1251. In the middle of the 13th century, the Toltecs were displaced by the Chichimecas, who ruled it from 1250 to 1400 under various rulers.

One of the tribes that moved into the Valley of Mexico in the 14th century were the Mexica, at a time when the city of Culhuacán was powerful. However, the area was divided into a number of dominions around the lake system of the valley, which vied among themselves for dominance. As late arrivals, the Mexica wandered among the various dominions and were granted permission to settle in Culhuacán territory. They lived together mostly peacefully. However, records indicate that the Mexicas were forced into servitude as punishment for raids by young warriors to carry off women from neighboring settlements. One legend states that problems between the two peoples began when the Mexica asked for and received a Culhua princess, Achitómetla, to become a goddess of war. The ceremony required the woman to be sacrificed, angering Culhuacán. The Mexica were eventually forced off Culhua lands and forced to settle on an island on the west side of the lake, although the stronger city of Culhuacán maintained relations with them. This new settlement, called Tenochtitlan, would begin rising and dominating since its establishment in 1325. The Aztec Triple Alliance would be formed in the early 15th century, as part of the process of uniting the Nahuatl-speaking peoples of the valley.

Part of this process included legitimizing the lineage Tenochtitlan&#x27;s rulers. These Mexica rulers used the time they spent in Culhuacán territory, and the links formed from it for this purpose. The ruling family could trace its ancestors back to Culhuacán ruler Nahuyotl. This and various marital ties from the past would make these new rulers descendants from the old. This was formalized with the government of Acamapichtli, who was granted the title of “culhua tecuhtli” (Lord of the Culhuas) . The Alliance came to include thirty dominions, with Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan, with Texcoco dominating the formerly powerful city of Culhuacán as well as Iztapalapa. As Tenochtitlan&#x27;s power grew, it eventually ruled the new empire alone.

As one of the first members of the Alliance, Iztapalapa was not conquered. It was indirectly ruled by Tenochtitlan as part of a confederation of four city-states (along with Mexicaltzingo, Huitzilopochco and Culhuacán) allied with the Mexica. Later, Itzcoatl’s son, Huehua Cuitlahuatzin would be made ruler of Iztapalapa. Under this arrangement, Iztapalapa did not pay tribute to Tenochtitlan, they did have to supply labor for major projects as well as military service. Iztapalapa was important in pre Hispanic times militarily and religiously as the side of the Huixachtécatl, today called the Cerro de la Estrella. This was the site of the New Fire ceremony, held once every 52 years, beginning anew cycle of years. The ceremony also required the destruction of all household goods to be replaced by new. Women and children would stay at home while the men participated in the distribution of the “new fire.” It was celebrated a total of nine times, with the last one in 1507 (2 acatl by the Aztec calendar). For this last celebration, Moctezuma had a temple construction on the summit called the Ayauhcalli, later named “the church of the New Fire” by the Spanish.

=== Colonial period ===
By the time the Spanish arrived, Culhuacán was no longer an important city; rather it had been eclipsed by Iztapalapa as one of the Aztec royal towns, chosen as such due to its defensive position. At that time, the area has about 10,000 inhabitants dedicated to chinampa agriculture and the raising of fish and birds. A causeway linking Iztapalapa and Tenochtitlan was one of the most important roads in the area. The construction of this causeway began in 1429 under Itzcoatl, using labor from peoples from the south of the valley such as the Xochimilcas. It consisted of artificial land built up from the shallow lake bottom, rising about a meter and a half over the lake&#x27;s surface and extending for about . It was wide enough for horses to cross in pairs. The causeway was divided by a fort called Xoloc, made of stone with towers, merlons and gates to control entrance and exit. This causeway also had a branch leading to Coyoacán. Its ruler was Cuitláhuac, born in 1476 as younger brother of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina and son of Axayacatl. Cuitláhuac received the Spanish in Iztapalapa before they went onto Tenochtitlan. They met in a garden which most Aztec lords had as a refuge and to demonstrate culture. In the center of the garden was a large palace made of sandstone and fine woods such as cedar.

In 1519, the Spanish took Moctezuma, Cacamatzin (ruler of Texcoco), Cuitlahuac and other nobles as prisoners. Cortés was then forced to return to Veracruz to face Spanish authorities, leaving Pedro de Alvarado in charge. Alvarado had hundreds of Aztec nobles killed. After Cortés returned, he liberated Cuitláhuac in exchange for supplies, allowing the lord to organize an army against the Spanish. Cuitlahuac succeeded Moctezuma as Aztec emperor and forced the Spanish to flee during the Noche Triste. However, Cuitlahuac was ruler only somewhere between 40 and 80 days according to various records. He spent that time repairing the city of Tenochtitlan as the Spanish regrouped in Tlaxcala. Cuitlahuac died of smallpox in December 1520, with Cuauhtémoc succeeding him.

After the Spanish and their allies regrouped in Tlaxcala, Cortés decided to attack Iztapalapa before besieging the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, in part to secure supplies. The city of Iztapalapa had about 10,000 people with about two-thirds of its structures built over water. Eight thousand Aztecs defended the city on land and on water. Cortés and his indigenous allied burned, massacred and destroyed the city completely, killing 6,000 of the city&#x27;s residents. But after the battle, when the Spanish let down their guard, Iztapalapa opened water channels to flood the city and drown the invaders. Most of the Spanish survived, but many of their Indian allies did not and were drowned. The Spanish lost all of their gunpowder.
After the Conquest, the pre-Hispanic temples of the area were destroyed, the Iztapalapa and surrounding cities were subjugated by Gonzalo de Sandoval. The process was brutal, as the area was highly loyal to Tenochtitlan, with more than 5,000 people killed by both war and epidemics. By the first census of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1552, Culhuacan was down to 817 inhabitants, and 260 in Mexicaltzingo.

Following the destruction of the temples, Augustinians and Franciscans moved in to build churches and monasteries. The Augustinians began construction of the Culhuacán monastery in 1552, built in various stages. It was dedicated to John the Baptist. They founded a school to teach indigenous languages which operated for 100 years. The Franciscans built a monastery in Huitzilopochco as well as small churches in San Marcos Mexicaltzingo and in Santa Marta and Nativitas Tepetlacingo. The churches of San Lucas Evangelista, San Marcos Mexicaltzingo, San Juan Evangelista and the chapels of Calvario and Santa Martha Acatitla were all built over foundations of pre-Hispanic temples which the Spanish had destroyed. These were built with much of the material from the destroyed temples. However, by the end of the 18th century, all of these would be in the hands of normal clergy.

Iztapalapa and several other nearby communities were under the direct control of Mexico City, but shortly after only Iztapalapa would remain so. Mexicaltzingo belonged to the Spanish Empire from early on. Iztapalapa became a tributary of Mexico City, required to provide food, manual labor and more. At the end of the 16th century, it too became property of the Spanish Crown. Other areas of the modern borough were made into encomiendas. Culhuacan came under the control of Cristóbal de Oñate, which remained in the family until the system was abolished. Later in the colonial period, the area would become a corregimiento headed by Mexicaltzingo and later an “alcaldia mayor” as it grew to include areas such as Los Reyes and Santa Marta.

During the colonial period, Iztapalapa was very rural, notable only as one of the primary providers of produce and flowers to Mexico City and its lake and canal transportation. Culhuacán had eighteen villages surrounding it in the pre Hispanic era, butby the 18th century, only San Lorenzo Tezonco and Santiago Acahualtepec remained. In the middle of the 18th century, there were still only 80 families in Iztapalapa, with 31 of them being Spanish. By the end of the same century, that would become 130 indigenous families distributed into nine barrios and three villages. At the end of the colonial period Iztapalapa would also include three haciendas and two ranches. During much of this time, Iztapalapa was also a stopover for travelers between Mexico City and Puebla or Veracruz. There were two main canals through here that connected the area with Chalco and Xochimilco. One of these was the Canal de la Viga, which was an important means of transporting corn, beans, vegetables and more into the capital These canals had control and customs checkpoints which divided Mexico City from rural areas. The most important of these was the La Viga control point due to the merchandise that passed through.

=== Independence ===
After the Mexican War of Independence, the Federal District of Mexico City was established as the new nation&#x27;s capital in 1824. The village of Iztapalapa became part of this district at the same time, but the borough had not yet been established. It would remain an autonomous settlement. In 1828, it was one of the municipalities outside of Mexico City proper. The rest of the 19th century would be concerned with disease and the status of the area&#x27;s water transportation.

A cholera epidemic in 1833 prompted the first passion play to be performed in this area, which has been performed since. In the middle of the 19th century, the town of Iztapalapa had 3,416 inhabitants. Drainage of the lakes in the Valley of Mexico would have an effect on the size and arrangement of water transportation. According to records, the ancient “Calzada de los Indios” (Indian Causeway) that linked Iztapalapa and the Villa Guadalupe was destroyed in 1835. Much of what is now the borough was lake or crisscrossed by various canals, which carried barge, canoe and even steamship traffic until the late 19th century. New canals were dug to connect Mexico City with Peñón Viejo, Chalco and San Isidro as well as the villages of Ayotla, Tlapicahua and Tlapacoya. By the end of this century, much of the lake and many of the small canals had dried. The main ones were the Mexicaltzingo canal and those near the Churubusco River. The Mexicalcingo canal was widened for steamships.

The canals would remain a part of the borough until the mid-20th century. Efforts to preserve the system began in 1920, when ejido owners turned over land to construct new ones. In the 1930s, many of the barrios of Iztapalapa were still marked by canals and still grew vegetables, fruits and flowers. Major traffic was confined mostly to the Canal Nacional on the borough&#x27;s border. However, groundwater pumping started in the 1950s lowered water tables and began the process of destroying the rest of the canals, and most of the chinampas along with them.

Industrialization began in the area in the 1890s but agriculture remained the most important economic activity. Most of the population in the area still lived in poor huts. In 1916, the haciendas and ranches of Iztapalapa were broken up and divided into ejidos; however the area remained extremely poor and there were disputes between Iztapalapa and neighboring Zapotitlán over ejido land. In 1920, the population was over 20,000 Iztapalapa would remain rural and poor until the 1950s, when its population and its urbanization began in earnest. In the 1940s, the urban sprawl of Mexico City had reached sections of the borough and furthering this was promoted by the federal government which favored industry over agriculture. In 1940, the chinampas suffered when the Canal de la Viga was drained, and only runoff from the Cerro de la Estrella was still available. Groundwater pumping dried swamps, allowing for more urbanization.

Iztapalapa had been semi-independent of Mexico City since the colonial era, but politically organized in various ways. It has been part of the Federal District since it was created, but this District was an unstable entity in the Reform War as Liberals, who favored a federalist government, fought with Conservatives, who favored a more centralized regime. Thus much of the borough would either be part of the Federal District or the State/Department of Mexico, depending on who was in power during the first half of the 19th century. The Federal District, including Iztapalapa, would be permanently restored in 1848, and then enlarged to its current dimensions between 1853 and 1854. Since that time, the Federal District has been reorganized several times, usually separating the Mexico City and making the other areas of the District either districts or municipalities. 

==== Modern history (1923-present) ====
The current borough was established in 1928, which created the current borough of Iztapalapa, centered on and named over the former municipality of Iztapalapa. This borough&#x27;s government was appointed by the Mexican federal government until 1970, when borough presidents began to be democratically elected.
From the 1950s to the present, the borough&#x27;s history has been dominated by its population growth and urbanization, along with the problems that come with it. Before 1970, the area still had various types of flora including forested hills, ponds and other surface water, grasslands and more. Chinampas and other farmland still existed as well. In the 1970s, waves of migrants from other parts of the country began to move into the borough. This prompted the building of a number of large apartment complexes including Unidad Vicente Guerrero, Unidad Ejército de Oriente, Unidad Santa Cruz Meyehualco, Conjunto Urbano Popular Ermita Zaragoza and Unidad Habitacional Ejército Constitucionalista. By 1980, all of the land that could be developed legally was, but the population continued to grow. 

In the 1990s, the borough had growth rates of over 100% according to INEGI. By 2000, the population of the borough accounted for over 20% of the total of the Federal District, the largest in population. Now almost all of the land in the borough has been urbanized, with only the highest elevations and a few family farm plots without buildings. The only green spaces are parks controlled by local or federal authorities, where various types of trees can still be found.

In 2006, there was a dispute in the election for borough president between activist , better known as “Juanito”, and Clara Brugada, then a former federal deputy. Juanito and supporters blocked the main entrance to the borough offices, but allowed employees access through other entrances. The protest was to have him declared the winner of borough president elections. In the end, Brugada retained the position.

During the 2010s, Iztapalapa was affected by severe water shortages in September 2017 following the 2017 Puebla earthquake, and in October and November of 2018. In 2020, Iztapalapa was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Iztapalapa as the &#x27;epicenter&#x27; of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, with the borough&#x27;s density and high rates of poverty cited as reasons why.

<text>Tlalpan ( , &#x27;place on the earth&#x27;) is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. It is the largest borough, with over 80% under conservation as forest and other ecologically sensitive area. The rest, almost all of it on the northern edge, has been urban since the mid-20th century. When it was created in 1928, it was named after the most important settlement of the area, Tlalpan, which is referred to as “Tlalpan center” (Tlalpan centro) to distinguish it from the borough.

This center, despite being in the urbanized zone, still retains much of its provincial atmosphere with colonial era mansions and cobblestone streets. Much of the borough&#x27;s importance stems from its forested conservation areas, as it functions to provide oxygen to the Valley of Mexico and serves for aquifer recharge. Seventy per cent of Mexico City&#x27;s water comes from wells in this borough.

However, the area is under pressure as its mountainous isolated location has attracted illegal loggers, drug traffickers, and kidnappers; the most serious problem is illegal building of homes and communities on conservation land, mostly by very poor people. , the government recognizes the existence of 191 of the settlements, which cause severe ecological damage with the disappearance of trees, advance of urban sprawl, and in some areas, the digging of septic pits. The borough is home to one of the oldest Mesoamerican sites in the valley, Cuicuilco, as well as several major parks and ecological reserves. It is also home to a number of semi-independent “pueblos” that have limited self-rule rights under a legal provision known as “usos y costumbres” (lit. uses and customs).

==Tlalpan center==

What is now called “Tlalpan center” or sometimes “the historic center of Tlalpan” began as a pre-Hispanic village located at the intersection of a number of roads that connected Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) with points south. This village was renamed Villa de San Agustín de las Cuevas in 1645, with the last part “de las Cuevas” referring to the many small caves in the area. During the colonial period, the village was a modest farming village, known for its fruit orchards. However, the forests of the area made it attractive to the elite of Mexico City who built country homes and haciendas here, much as they did in other areas south of the city such as Chimalistac, San Ángel and Coyoacán .

Many of these homes and manor houses of the former haciendas still remain in and round Tlalpan center. As the urban sprawl of Mexico City only began to reach this area starting in the mid-twentieth century, much of the former village has retained its provincial streets, older homes and other buildings with façades of reds, whites, blues and other colors, although a number have been converted into other uses such as cafes, restaurants and museums. This makes the area similar to neighboring Coyoacán, and like this neighbor, Tlalpan center is popular with visitors, especially on weekends as people come to see its provincial main square/garden, mansions, narrow winding cobblestone streets lined with large trees, eat in its restaurants and cafes and visit its many nearby parks and other green areas. One popular area with cafes and restaurants is La Portada, on one side of the main plaza.

Tlalpan center has eighty structures from the 16th to the 20th centuries that have been classified by INAH as having historic value. Some of these include old Tlalpan Hacienda, the former home of the Marquis de Vivanco and the San Agustin parish church. The borough of Tlalpan has sought World Heritage Site status for the area because of these structures, the area&#x27;s history and the nearby site of Cuicuilco.

The center of this former village is the main square or garden officially called the “Plaza de la Constitución” but better known as the “Jardín Principal” (Main Garden). Visually, what stands out is the large kiosk in the center, but historically more important is the “Arbol de los colgaldos” (Tree of the Hanged). This tree, still alive, was used to hang political enemies and bandits, including those opposed to the invading French Army during the French Intervention in Mexico. On weekends, vendors set up stalls selling handcrafts and other items. To one side of the plaza, there is a cantina called La Jalisciense, one of the oldest in Mexico City, having been in operation for over 135 years.

Facing the Jardín Principal, there is the “Palacio de Gobierno” (Government Palace), which was the site of the government of the State of Mexico, when Tlalpan served as state capital for six years in the early 19th century. Since then, it was used as a barracks for Benito Juárez’s soldiers, a jail, a residence for the Empress Carlota and the site of the Instituto Literario (today the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México) . Today, it serves as the headquarters of the borough, although it is also commonly referred to as the “ex palacio municipal” (former municipal palace) referring to the time when Tlalpan was an independent municipality in the State of Mexico. The current structure was built between 1889 and 1900 in Neoclassical style.

On another side of the main square, there is the San Agustin Church. The village church was established here in 1547 by the Dominicans, but the current structure on the site dates from the 18th century. It has an austere façade and faces the main square. Around it is an atrium, some simple gardens and a patios shaded by fruit trees. A fire at the end of the 19th century destroyed the Baroque altar, replaced with the sober one seen today. This parish is the site of the annual San Agustin de las Cuevas Festival, which is the largest religious event in the borough.

Casa Frissac is located just off the main square. It was built in the 19th century in French style as the residence of Jesús Pliego Frissac. According to local legend, bandit Chucho el Roto lived here at one time. In the 20th century, it belonged to Adolfo López Mateos then it became the site of the Lancaster School, which closed in the 1980s. In the 1950s, it was used as a set for the film &quot;Los Olvidados&quot;, by Luis Buñuel. Today, the house is still the protagonist for a number of local ghost stories; however, its official function is that of a cultural center called the Instituto Javier Barros Sierra. This center began operations in 2001 after 21,800,000 pesos worth of remodeling, which restored the structure to much of its 19th-century look. The center has hosted art exhibits by photographers, graffiti artists, and more—many with a political message. While the center&#x27;s authorities insist the center is non-political, members of Mexico&#x27;s PAN party raised objections to the content in the center&#x27;s first year.

The Museo de Historia de Tlalpan (Museum of the History of Tlalpan, is housed in a building known as “La Casona” (The Mansion), which dates to 1874. In addition to its age, one of its claims to fame is that it is the site of the first long distance telephone call in Mexico, calling a telephone in the then-separate Mexico City. This call was made on 20 March 1878 and the telephone used to make the call is on display here. The mansion was classified as a historic monument by 1986, and it was converted into the current museum in 2003 after extensive remodeling, which included restoration of the original murals. The museum explores the culture and history of the Tlalpan borough. It also has a permanent collection of art work by Gilberto Aceves Navarro, Alberto Castro Leñero, Isabel Leñero, Javier Anzure Joëlle Rapp and Jorge Hernandez.

The museum was opened to be part of a “cultural circuit” integrated with other facilities such as Casa Frissac. Prior to the opening of this museum, the only other museum (as opposed to a cultural center focused on classes) was the Museo Soumaya, which is private. Much of the museum&#x27;s collection of historic items was donated by over one hundred individual residents and include documents, photographs, artworks and more. These donations cover the eight rural “pueblos” in the Ajusco area, traditional barrios and the major apartment complexes in Coapa and San Lorenzo Huipulco as well as Tlalpan center. An organization called the Centro de Documentacion Historica de la Delegacion now accepts, organizes and cares for the borough collection of historic items.

Twenty blocks of Tlalpan center have been designated at the “Museo Público de Arte Contémporaneo de Tlalpan (MUPACT), an “open-air” museum of art, which opened in 2006 with eighteen works. The works are displayed on walls, trees, sidewalks and even streets. The borough offers a nominal fee for works selected to be displayed and requires that said works have a “strong social content.” One of the works that has been displayed was when artist Georgina Toussaint convinced the inmates of a Centro de Tratamiento de Varones to draw images of their identity and then displayed the works on the façade of the facility.

A major attraction of the center, not far from the square, is a manor house that belonged to the former Tlalpan Hacienda. The manor was constructed in 1737 around a central courtyard. Although the hacienda no longer exists, the structure is still surrounded by large gardens. The manor house is currently used as a luxury hotel and restaurant, although there are various salons available as well for events. When it was converted to its present use, it was remodeled in “Neo-Mexican” look with touches of Art Nouveau. The main restaurant offers traditional Mexican dishes with chiles en nogada, cabrito (roast goat), escamoles and duck as specialties. It has large gardens filled with peacocks. Much of the interior décor has been modeled in styles from the 19th century and earlier to evoke the grandeur of the area&#x27;s upper class of that time.

Scattered among the cobblestone streets of the old village are a number of other notable houses and structure from various centuries. The Casa Chata is on the corner of Hidalgo and Matamoros Streets. It was built in the 18th century, with one corner cut off, creating a small façade around the main entrance. The name refers to this feature as “chata” mean flattened, or pushed in. As Tlalpan was the capital of the State of Mexico for six years, a number of constructions related to this function, such as the Casa de Moneda (coin mint) and a government print shop were built and still remain. In the latter, Cuban writer José María Heredia published poems about his stay in Mexico.

Other religious institutions include the Convent of the Capuchinas (the Capuchin Poor Clares), which still functions as a convent, where one can buy cookies made by the resident nuns. There is also the Capilla del Calvario, which was built in the 17th century. The former house of the Count De Regla is found on Congreso Street, and on San Fernando Street, there is a house where José María Morelos y Pavón was held prisoner. Another house on this street was occupied by Antonio López de Santa Anna. A notable market in the area is the Mercado de la Paz, which was built in 1900.

This historic center was designated as a &quot;Barrio Mágico&quot; by the city in 2011.

==The borough==

===Political divisions===
Tlalpan is the largest of Mexico City&#x27;s sixteen boroughs, and vastly larger than the traditional village of Tlalpan. It has a surface of 310 km2 and accounts for 20.6% of Mexico City, and a total population of 650,567 inhabitants. It lies at the far south of Mexico City bordering the boroughs of Coyoacán, Xochimilco and Milpa Alta with the state of Morelos to the south and the State of Mexico to the southwest.

Administratively, the borough is divided into five zones: Centro de Tlalpan (pop. 163,209), Villa Coapa (118,291), Padierna Miguel Hidalgo (148,582), Ajusco Medio (59,905), and Pueblos Rurales (99,447). All of these are divided into neighborhoods variously called “colonias”, “barrios”, “fraccionamientos” or “unidades habitacionales” with the exception of the Pueblo Rurales area, which also contains eight semi independent villages. The far northern zones such as Tlalpan Center, Villa Coapa, and Padierna Miguel Hidalgo are urbanized areas where the sprawl of the city has reach, which the southern sections are still rural. The urbanized areas account for only about 15% of the borough, with the rest belonging to conservation areas or ejido communal lands. Pueblos Rurales is the largest zone, but 83% of the borough population is concentrated in the other four.

===Urban areas===

The urban sprawl of Mexico City reached the borough of Tlalpan in the mid-20th century, but only the far north of the borough is urbanized. This area accounts for over 80% of the borough population, who live in a mix of middle class residential areas and large apartment complexes for the lower classes. This northern area is crossed by a number of major road arteries such as the Anillo Periférico, Calzada de Tlalpan, Viaducto-Tlalpan, Acoxpa, Division del Norte/Miramontes, which experience extremely heavy traffic during rush hour. The highway connecting Mexico City with Cuernavaca also passes through the borough. Intersections of these major roads have large commercial and retail complexes such as that of Avenida Insurgentes and Anillo Periferico, which has several of these complexes, as this is a major highway connection for the south of the city.

Traffic and parking are the most serious issues for the areas in the urban areas, as the borough struggles to keep up with the demand but also keep areas such as Tlalpan Centro at least somewhat provincial. Parking problems are greatest in Ajusco Medio, Padiernoa, Pedregales and Colonia Miguel Hidalgo. Traffic problems are worst in Tlalpan center where the narrow streets get jammed by the vehicles of both residents and visitors, especially around the main plaza. The increasing popularity of this area with visitors makes the situation worse on weekends. In the urban areas, problems are similar to that in other parts of Mexico City and include carjacking, illegal firearms, muggings, graffiti, deterioration of infrastructure. Most crime is reported in the Villa Coapa with Tlalpan center coming in second.

===Rural communities===

The rest of the borough is filled with forested areas, rugged mountains and small communities, some of which have had a way of life little changed since colonial times. The Pueblos Rurales Zone contains only about one sixth of the borough&#x27;s population, with the most important concentrations of people being the eight semi-independent communities. These villages are San Miguel Topilejo, San Pedro Mártir, San Andrés Totoltepec, San Miguel Xicalco, San Miguel Ajusco, Santo Tomás Ajusco, Magdalena Petlacalco, and Parres El Guarda.

These “pueblos” govern much of their local affairs through “usos y costumbres,” modern legal recognition of the old village governing structures still in place, many of which use some form of direct democracy. This is in stark contrast to areas such as Villa Coapa, where almost all local decisions are made by representatives. Because of the rugged terrain, few roads and little police protection, these settlements are isolated. While protected from some of crime problems that affect their urban counterparts, this isolation has made the area attractive for drug runners bringing their merchandise into Mexico City, for kidnappers, illegal logging and more, which has led to a number of murders in the area.

Many of high peaks between the borough and the State of Mexico are used as lookouts for criminal organizations. Because of this, the borough ranks ninth in criminal activity. The largest problem is illegal settlements. An estimated 191 forested and other areas have been taken over by about 8,000 families. Some of these communities are over twenty years old. Although some of the illegal construction represents individuals trying to claim a large tract, most of it is shantytowns for the poor with few or no services.

===Geography and ecology===

Tlalpan is located between the mountains that separate Mexico City from the states of Morelos and Mexico and the rocky areas of San Angel, Ciudad Universitaria and the delegation of Coyoacán. The south of the borough consists of the mountain ranges of Chichinautzin and Ajusco, which preserve most of the forested areas remaining in Mexico City. Fifteen of mountains in this area reach at least 3,000 masl, which include the two highest: Cruz del Marqués (3,930masl) and Pico del Aguila (3,880masl) . The borough, like the rest of the Valley of Mexico, lies on central part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt .

Much of the geology of the area formed when the Xitle volcano erupted in 100 CE, which created numerous caves and formed the basis of the volcanic soil that, 600 years later, makes the area&#x27;s agriculture so productive. The borough has two types of soil: rocky in higher elevations and—in lower areas—less solid and containing more groundwater, making it somewhat spongy. The area experiences regular seismic activity, mostly of low intensity, which is believed mostly from small ancient faults reactivated by regional stresses, or by the sinking of the Valley of Mexico. The south of the Valley, including Tlalpan, is also affected by the underground movement of magma, especially when such contacts the waterlogged regions of the former Lake Xochimilco. Most of these tremors go unnoticed except for those that occur close to the surface such as the one centered 5 km south of the Ciudad Universitaria on 16 October 2005 (mag. 3.1). However, even this one was not felt far from its epicenter. Three areas in the borough are susceptible to seismic activity over 7.5 on the Richter scale: Colonia Isidro Fabela, Villa Coapa, and Tlalpan Centro. These areas are subject to special building inspections and annual earthquake drills. The borough has a warmer and more humid climate than the rest of Mexico City. 

, 83.5% of the borough was officially defined as conservation space; however, the increase in illegal settlements and logging has been eroding this percentage. The forests are important to the Valley of Mexico/Mexico City as they not only release oxygen into the air, they are an important area for the recharge of the valley&#x27;s aquifers. Wells from this borough provide 70% of Mexico City&#x27;s potable water. The borough has 120 wells for potable water (out of a total of 450 in the city), which extract about 60 liters each second from each well. However, water shortages are relatively common in the borough proper. Most of this is due to the lack of wells, drilling equipment and pipelines to serve local residents, with the city authorities only reserving less than a fifth of its infrastructure budget for works in Tlalpan. One serious outage of water occurred in 2001 when thirty nine of the borough&#x27;s colonias were without dependable water for two weeks because of the lack of water reserves. Deforestation and other ecological damage make a number of areas susceptible to flooding during the rainy season from June to October. These include Anillo Periférico, Renato Leduc, Boulevard de la Luz and the Picacho Highway. Forest fires are a common problem not only in the Bosque de Tlalpan but also in Parque Fuentes Brotantes, Parque Ciudad de Mexico and the Cerro de Zacatepetl.

==Forests and green areas==

===Degradation of forest areas===
Tlalpan has some of the largest forested lands within the Mexico City limits, with over 80% of this borough officially declared to be in conservation. However, only 4% of the borough is considered to be unharmed ecologically. The areas most affected by human activity are at the foot of the Xitle and Xictontle volcanos. The forest under protection in the borough equals 30,000 hectares but it is protected by only thirty-eight forest rangers, each with a territory of about 1,000 hectares of forest, canyons and volcanic areas. Three are provided by the Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente, fifteen from the Comisión de Recursos Naturales of Mexico City and twenty by the borough itself. These rangers work against illegal loggers, settlers and drug traffickers, who are often armed. The three main problems in the protected areas is illegal logging, the dumping of trash and rubble, squatting, and the theft of volcanic rock (for building materials). Most of the time, all the rangers can do is report the illegal activity to federal authorities but response is spotty.

The major problem is illegal settlements. In all of Mexico City there are over 800 illegal settlements which have some official recognition and occupy almost 60% of lands considered to be protected. These areas may hold as many as 180,000 residents who lack basic services, and cause grave ecological damage. These settlement make trees disappear and furthers urban sprawl. Erosion in conservation areas impedes aquifer recharge and disrupts the flow of surface water.

In Tlalpan, settlements are in Ajusco Medio, Pedregales and Padierna, where the mountainous terrain and/or volcanic rock severely limits the ability to provide services, often leading to residents creating septic pits. Since 2003, illegal settlements in Tlalpan have grown from 148(peligra), to 191 settlements that the government recognizes the existence of. Many settlements have occurred because communal owners of ejidos have illegally sold parts of their land at cheap prices to settlers on the outskirts of the city proper. Most illegal building is done by the very poor but there are also cases in which those which money illegally take over large sections of land for their own use. Illegal settlements have been made by individual families but increasingly developers are working to build illegal settlements in protected areas as well, by buying land and creating subdivisions with services, hoping to fix things with authorities later. In the early 2000s, the borough conducted over 125 operations to evict illegal settlements, dismantling over 440 housing units, but since 2005, the borough no longer has the authority to do this. Many of these illegal settlements seek and then get court orders prohibiting their removal and demanding services, first potable water then drainage.

To moderate the damage, there have been both public and private reforestation efforts. In 2005, forty families worked to plant 1,000 new trees in the Bosque de Tlalpan as part of an annual event sponsored by ecological associations such as Cultura Integral Forestal and Ciencia Cultura y Bosques. This annual event takes place in early July during the beginning of the rainy season and has been repeated for over twenty years. The event was initially sponsored by the Cultura Integral Forestal, made up of principally ex employees of the Loreto y Peña Pobre paper factory. Replanting efforts are focused on the main mountains of the Bosque de Tlalpan as well as the Tenantongo Valley in the same forest, planting mostly holm oak and ash trees. The annual effort has reforested over 1,500 hectares, using seeds encased in a clay ball designed to protect the seed and allow its germination. However, reforestation efforts have not been able to keep up with the deforestation of much of the borough.

===Parque Nacional Cumbres del Ajusco===

This is a national forest which covers much of the Sierra de Ajusco and Chichinautzin mountain ranges that separate Mexico City from the states of Morelos and the State of Mexico. A portion of this forest is located in the borough of Tlalpan, as well as Milpa Alta and Xochimilco. Much of the range consists of volcanic cones, almost all dormant, with the most prominent being Xitle. Depending on altitude, the climate ranges from temperate to cold, with all but the highest elevations covered in mostly pine forests. In winter, the highest peaks occasionally are covered in snow.

===Bosque de Tlalpan===
The Bosque de Tlalpan, also called the Parque Nacional Bosque de Pedregal, is fully surrounded by urban area, just south of the Anillo Periférico and between the highways heading to Cuernavaca and to Picacho-Ajusco. The Bosque de Tlalpan is filled with pines, oyamel fir, cedars, oaks and eucalyptus trees, which grow on a solidified lava bed. Wildlife includes eagles, falcons, squirrels and the Mexican mouse opossum. It has been open to the public since 1968. It has parking, restaurants and food stalls in cabins, playgrounds its own Casa de Cultura or cultural center.

One of the attractions in the park is the Tenantono Pyramid, which is located in a remote area of the park. Better known is the old Casa de la Bombas. This is an early 20th-century structure originally built in Colonia Condesa, Tlalpan to house a pump used to extract water from the ground. It ceased being a pump station in 1940 and laid vacant until 1975, when it was disassembled and moved to the Bosque. However, it was not reassembled until 1986 as part of a larger structure which now serves as a “Casa de Cultura” or cultural center. The façade of the center is made of volcanic stone called “chiluca” in French style, which was popular when it was originally built. The additions combine modern and Neoclassical elements but the interior is completely modern. The main areas are the gallery and the forum which host exhibitions and other events. There are also a number of workshops for dance, drama, music, literature and other arts. It is also the home of the Orquesta Juvenil de Tlalpan (Youth Orchestra of Tlalpan) .

===Other parks===
Fuentes Brotantes de Tlalpan is a national park with an area of about one km2 running alongside a small canyon. It has a small lake and its own Casa de Cultura (cultural center). It has problems with trash and its ecosystem is heavily damaged, although there a number of large Moctezuma cypress trees.

The Parque Ecológico Loreto y Peña Pobre is located on what were the lands of a former paper factory and extends over 21,000m2. This factory, called Loreto y Peña Pobre, was built in the late 19th century (a time called the Porfiriato in Mexico) when many factories and other infrastructure was built in this area. The paper factory shut down in the 20th century, and its main building eventually became a mall, called the Plaza Inbursa (formerly Plaza Cuicuilco), which is known for its various entertainment options such as restaurants and movie theaters. In 1989, the rest of the lands were converted into this ecological park. It contains a model house showing alternative technologies designed to avoid environmental damage. Workshops are offered for children at the site, as well as restaurants serving organic food.

The Parque Juana de Asbaje was established in 1999, on the site of a former psychiatric hospital on land measuring 17,000m2. It has green areas along with a bookstore selling coloring books of pre-Hispanic deities for children and replicas of archeological objects. In 2005, the area generated controversy as the borough sought to relocate the Luis Cabrera Library. Residents initially objected, stating that it would develop too much of what is legally public space. However, later studies found that the land was not originally part of the public land grant, and the expanded library would be beneficial to the community. It was then built and has a collection of 11,000 books.

The Parque Ecologico Ejidal San Nicolás Totolapan is located by the semi-independent rural village of the same name covering over 2,000 hectares. It contains an important reserves of tree species such as pine, oyamel fir, white cedar and holm oak, as well as meadows. It is home to eighty-two species of animals, many of which are migratory species from the United States and Canada. It is open to the public for hiking, skiing, camping, mountain biking and horseback riding.

==History==

The first major population center in this part of the Valley of Mexico was Cuicuilco, which was populated as early as 1000 BCE. The current site contains an unusual circular pyramid, and is believed to mimic one of the volcanoes in the area. Cuicuilco was destroyed by a volcanic eruption from Xitle in 100 CE, whose lava flow eventually covered much of the south of the Valley of Mexico, creating what is now called the Pedregales del Sur as well as numerous caves and caverns. This also created areas with rich volcanic soil which would allow for agriculture and repopulation 600 years later.

However, the area would not have another major city state, and eventually it was dominated by the Aztecs from Tenochtitlan by the 15th century. It is from their language, Nahuatl, that the name of Tlalpan, would come to be used for the largest village in the area. It means “over the earth” and refers to roads that converged here, linking Tenochtitlan with points south. The borough&#x27;s glyph or symbol is the one given to the historic center by the Aztecs, a footprint over a symbol for clay soil.

The area come under control of the Spanish after the fall of Tenochtitlan, and the village&#x27;s name was changed from Tlapan to Villa de San Agustin de las Cuevas in 1645. San Agustin is the area&#x27;s patron saint, and the name of the parish church built by the Dominicans in the early 16th century. The last part means “of the caves,” referring to the many caves and caverns formed in the area by an eruption of the Xitle volcano in 100 CE. Initially, this area south of the Valley of Mexico was part of lands administered by authorities in Coyoacán. During the colonial period, the old village of Tlalpan was a modest farming village, known for its orchards and extensive forests. The latter made it attractive as a retreat for the wealthy of Mexico City. These elite established country homes and haciendas, which eventually became the economic base of the area. By the 18th century, the village of Tlalpan was large enough to be an ecclesiastical center.

After Independence, the Constitution of 1824, divided Mexico into states, with the area around Mexico City separated as a Federal District. However, the Tlalpan area was initially part of the then very large State of Mexico, which surrounded Mexico City. Tlalpan became the capital of the State of Mexico from 1837 until 1855, when the area was incorporated into the Federal District. U.S. troops passed this way in 1847 on the road to Coyoacán where they fought Mexican troops at the Battle of Churubusco .

After this war, President Antonio López de Santa Anna, expanded the Federal District south over Tlalpan to the southern mountains to make the Federal District more defensible. The village of Tlalpan became the head of what was then called the Southern Prefecture. Foreign troops passed through here again during the French Intervention in Mexico. Mexican opponents of this invasion in the village were hung at the “Arbol de los colgados” in the central plaza or square.

The latter decades are marked by industrialization. In the 1860s and 1870s varies types of modern infrastructure was introduced including telegraph (1866), railroad (1869) and the first long distance telephone in Mexico in 1878. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, (known as the Porfirato), various factories were established in the area including the then well known paper factory called Loreto y Peña Pobre. Today, the site of this factory is an ecological park. However, the village itself remained relatively untouched, filled with cobblestone streets and haciendas owned by the wealthy and filled with orchards growing apples, plums and more. No battle of the Mexican Revolution occurred here, but Zapatista troops passed through, allowing for a historic meeting between Emiliano Zapata and Francisco Villa in Tlalpan.

The borough of Tlalpan was created in 1928, when the Federal District of Mexico City was reorganized into 16 administrative parts called &quot;delegaciones&quot; (boroughs). At that time, the area was still very rural showing little influence from then-fast growing Mexico City. One reason for this was the area called the Pedregal, the old hardened lava flow from the Xitle volcano on much of the north end of the borough. This made development of much of the borough impossible until the mid-20th century. With the construction of the Jardines de Pedregal by Luis Barragán and the Ciudad Universitaria by Mario Pani, the city began to grow in that direction. The urban sprawl of Mexico City began to reach Tlalpan centero in the middle of the 20th century.

For the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, two facilities were constructed in the delegation. Both were housing facilities for athletes called Villa Olimpica and Villa Coapa, which were turned into permanent houses after the games ended. In the 1990s, borough authorities warned that there was no more space in Tlalpan suitable for development and that preservation of the ecological areas needed to be primary as most of the territory is mountainous, with delicate forests and meadows. However, illegal settlements in conservation areas have continued the advance of urban sprawl into ecologically sensitive and protected areas. Most of these families are poor and the lack of living space pushes them into these areas where there are no services.(mancah) The advance of urbanization means the loss of protected areas and the loss of environmental services provided by the city government. It also increased the demand for borough services such as water, sewerage and roads, despite environmental regulations.

==Culture and recreation==

The Festival Ollin Jazz Tlalpan Internacional is a series of concerts which has hosted artists such as Enrique Neri, Eugenio Toussaint, Agustín Bernal, Bill McHenry, Brian Allen and Héctor Infanzón. The annual event takes place at the Multiforo Ollin Kan and other venues in the borough.

Six Flags México, the largest theme park in Latin América, is located in Tlalpan. This park is the most popular recreation center in the city and has numerous roller coasters, rides and shows.

Just outside the archeological zone of Cuicuilco is the Centro Cultural Ollin Yoliztli (Movement and Life), where professional classes in music and dance are offered. Its concert hall is one of the sites of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Mexico City. There is another smaller hall dedicated to chamber music as well as galleries for exhibitions.

In the Torre de Telmex (Telmex Tower) the Soumaya Museum was inaugurated in 1998, which features a collection of 19th century sculpture including works by Antonio Rosseti, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Auguste Rodin and Dominico Morone. Soumaya also holds temporary exhibits such as one called “Sanctuarios de lo intimo” which featured more than 600 miniature portraits and reliquaries in 2005. Nearby is the Mercado de Muebles Vasco de Quiroga furniture market where items such as bedroom sets, armoires, bookcases, tables and more are both made and sold.

The borough has sponsored graffiti artists to paint certain public areas such as on and under bridges. The goal is to divert said artists away from illegally defacing property and creating murals and encouraging more talented prospects to more formal training. These graffiti murals have had themes such as the war in Iraq and can be seen at intersections as Insurgentes/Renato Leduc and Calzada Tlalpan/Viaducto Tlalpan as well as on the highway leading to Cuernavaca. The borough has also encouraged the creation of formal graffiti “guilds” to work with authorities on projects.

In 2006, the borough constructed a public pool facility in Colonia Heroes de Padierna. The semi-Olympic sized pool is part of a sports facility that promotes sustainable development; the pool is solar heated. Heroes de Padierna is a lower-class neighborhood and the pool is aimed at attracting children and youths, charging only a small fee, in order to provide alternative recreation and sporting opportunities for families with few resources. The pool was built at a cost of 10,500,000 pesos with another million spent creating a soccer field alongside.

==Education==

===Post-secondary education===

Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City is physically small, densely packed campus that is divided into two parts. In one are the academic and administrative facilities, and in the other are the sports facilities. The design of its buildings reflect the various architectural styles that exist in Mexico City from the 17th to the 20th centuries., and is designed to reflect the historic center of this city. The campus offers programs and degrees from the high school/preparatory level to the doctorate level. Most university and graduate school programs focus on the sciences and technology, with a number of business and legal programs. The campus also sponsors research programs in the applied sciences as well as recreational and counseling programs for its students.(campus p19) The campus was founded in 1973 and was originally located in downtown Mexico City.

When the campus had grown sufficiently, land in the southern part of the city was purchases and a new campus built there in 1990. Since then the campus has grown with new programs and new installations. In 2004, the campus and borough authorities signed an agreement to provide online preparatory education open to the public run as a joint venture between ITESM and the borough. The online program is meant to solve some of the problems with providing educational opportunities to the more rural areas of the borough such the communities of Ajusco Medio and Ajusco Alto. In addition, to the online resources, students from the campus can also complete their social service requirement for graduation by tutoring in rural schools in the borough.

One of the most successful of Universidad del Valle de Mexico’s campuses is in the borough. In 2004, UVM expanded its campus and accommodates over 8,000 students. It offers over 25 bachelor&#x27;s degrees in areas such as law, education, architecture, mechanical engineering and accounting as well as seven master&#x27;s degrees. The campus contains 154 classrooms, 2 large lecture halls, over 12 computer labs, and a central library with book and digital divisions. The campus also offers sports and other recreational facilities for students.

===Primary and secondary schools===

Of the 619 schools in the borough, 475 are pre-schools and primary schools. Ninety-seven are technical schools, and forty-seven are academic high schools or preparatory. Only 2.8% of the population over the age of fifteen is illiterate. Educationally, there are as many as ten areas of the borough where the lack of education is considered to be critical, mostly in the very rural isolated areas such as Ajusco Medio and Ajusco Alto areas. One effort to provide better education to the rural area is the first Preparatoria de los Pueblos of Tlalpan. It is public preparatory school was constructed in the Topilejo on a site donated by the village. The borough signed agreements with various universities such as UNAM, UAM and IPN to help provide teaching staff.

National public high schools of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) &quot;Escuela Nacional Preparatoria&quot; include:

==Economy==
Tlalpan accounts for 6.8% of Mexico City&#x27;s workforce. Most are employed in services (48.5%), followed by commerce (25.1%) and manufacturing (15.8%). The borough accounts for 4.4% of Mexico City&#x27;s GDP, mostly from services (68.6% of the borough GDP), transportation and commerce. The borough accounts for 13.3% of Mexico City&#x27;s rural economy (agriculture, forestry etc.) producing staple crops such as corn and beans as well as fruits (apples, peaches, etc.) and cut and uncut flowers. Livestock percentages of higher producing 28% of cattle, 23.2% of pigs and 66.9%.
There have been efforts by the city tourism agency to bring more tourism to the borough, especially to Tlalpan center. One proposal is to have the Turibus tour bus system include a stop in the area. However, studies and neighborhood groups have express concerns about the possibility of this leading to deterioration of the area.

==Cuicuilco==
Cuicuilco is the site of the first large-scale ceremonial center in the Mexican Plateau and one of oldest of any size in the Americas, with occupation starting around 1000 BCE. Cuicuilco means “place of hieroglyphics” in Nahuatl. The most important structure of the site is the Gran Basamento Circular or “Great Circular Base” which has characteristics typical for the Pre-Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology (800BCE to 150AC). There are two access ramps on the east and west sides aligned with the sun on the equinoxes. Today, still on these days, many visitors come dressed in white. Eruptions from the nearby Xitle volcanos destroyed the center and its population relocating to other parts of the Valley of Mexico. These same eruptions covered much of the south of the Valley of Mexico, created the rock bed known as the Pedregales del Sur, which cover parts of Tlalpan. There is a site museum which features small anthropomorphic figures.

==Villa Olimpica==
Near Cuiculco there is the Villa Olímpica which was constructed in 1968, and a zone with sculptures called the Ruta de la Amistad (Friendship Route), created for the Cultural Olympics of 1968. The Villa Olímpica, along with Villa Coapa, were housing complexes for athletes curing the 1968 Olympic Games, which were subsequently converted into lower class housing afterwards. The Villa Olímpica also contains sporting facilities built at the same time, which currently serve 1,500 visitors per day. In 2003, these faculties were rehabilitated by the Federaciones Mexicanas de Atletismo y de Deportes en Silla de Ruedas and the borough. Some of these include the Olympic track and the indoor gymnasium.

The area also hosts one of Mexico City&#x27;s artificial beaches, called the Playa Villa Olímpica. On busy days, this beach can receive as many as 5,000 visitors, requiring workers to go through the beach area every two hours just to pick up garbage. However, water quality in the various pools tends to suffer greatly during peak times.

==The Pueblos area==
The origins of the pueblos comes from the colonial period, when authorities worked to group dispersed bands of indigenous into villages centered around a church. This allowed them more control over the population and to regulate the economy. The pueblos in Tlalpan were mostly founded in the 16th century. In the most rural areas of Mexico City, some of these pueblos still exist intact. In Tlalpan, these include San Pedro Mártir, San Andrés Totoltepec, San Miguel Topilejo, San Miguel Xicalco, Parres el Guarda, Magdalena Petlacalco, San Miguel Ajusco and Santo Tomás Ajusco. The last two are often referred to together as “the two Ajuscos.”

The name Petlacalco means “house of palm mats.” It was one of the first villages established on the slopes of the Ajusco Mountain. It took the prefix of Magdalena to honor Mary Magdalene, as patron saint. The town is centered on a church built in 1725. It has one nave divided into three sections and a presbytery with a Neoclassical altar. On this altar is an image of Mary Magdalene which dates from the 18th century. The wooden main doors of the church were constructed much later, 1968. The town&#x27;s saint&#x27;s days are 1 January and 22 July. It also has a patron an image of the Señor de la Columna, an image of Jesus as he was tied to a post for flogging. This image is brought out for procession and other honors on the first Friday of Lent. The village is surrounded by communal lands in which there are forests, surface water and landscapes that the residents are tasked with conserving. It is the site of El Arenal, a sand dune formed by the ash of the Xitle volcano. The area attracts families and other visitors who climb dunes.

Parres el Guarda was founded in the middle of the 19th century as a rail town, when the line connecting Mexico City and Cuernavaca was built. Parres was an important stop for both passengers and freight along this line. The community was founded on lands that belonged to the Juan de las Fuentes Parres Hacienda, giving the town its name. Today, one can still see the ruins of the old hacienda main house. Its economy currently is based on the cultivation of animal feed and is an important producer of this product. It is also known for the sheep meat which is most often used in the preparation of barbacoa in the Mexico City area. Its patron saint is the Virgin of Guadalupe, celebrated on 12 December traditionally with the Chinelos dance, fireworks, cockfights and more.

San Andrés Totoltepec was founded in 1548, when the lands in this area were taken from their indigenous owners and the residents moved to the new village, with its church whose current structure was built in the 18th century. In 1560, the lands were returned for communal possession of the village. The name Nahuatl name Totoltepec mean “turkey hill.” Over half of the village&#x27;s residents today are dedicated to commerce, one fifth to industry and only a tenth to agriculture and livestock. Of the land surrounding it, 40% is unsuitable for farming due to volcanic rock. The center of the town is its church, dedicated to the Apostle Andrew. It has one nave, choir and presbytery with an altarpiece from the 18th century. This altarpiece has paintings of Christ receiving baptism and the appearances of the Virgin of Guadalupe. At the top, there is an image of Andrew, sculpted in wood. The east wall has a paintings from the 18th century with an image of Saint Isadore the Laborer, along with an image of the Virgin Mary in wood and an image of Christ in cornstalk paste.

San Miguel Ajusco was founded in 1531 by an indigenous leader named Tecpanécatl under the auspices of the Spanish. The center of the village then and now is church founded in dedicated to the Archangel Michael. According to local tradition, this angel has appeared to the village three times. The church&#x27;s current structure dates to 1707, with an 18th-century wood sculpture of the Archangel in the presbytery. The main portal is made of sandstone with a high relief of Saint James the Greater which as has an inscription in Nahuatl. The archangel is commemorated on 8 May and 29 September, with Chinelos, rodeo and other traditional events. Near the village, there is an area called Las Calaveras at the foot of the Mesontepec Hill, which has a small pyramid called Tequipa.

San Miguel Topilejo was founded by Franciscan friars under Martín de Valencia. Topilejo is from Nahuatl and means “he who wields the precious scepter of command”. One of the main attractions is the San Miguel Arcangel Church on the town&#x27;s main square. This church was built in 1560, with the cupola redone in the 18th century and the tower finished in 1812. The atrium is built over what probably was a pre-Hispanic platform. It was declared a historic monument by the federal government in 1932. The town&#x27;s economy is mostly based on farming, producing crops such as vegetables, houseplants, oats and corn, with 40% of the population dedicated to this. The town and church is dedicated to the Archangel Michael who is honored each 29 September with Aztec dance, Chinelos, wind band and other folk and popular dance. The town also hosts the annual Feria del Elote (Corn Fair) which began in 1985.

San Miguel Xicalco is located just off the Mexico City-Cuernavaca highway. Xicalco comes from Nahuatl and means “house of grass” or “house of plants.” San Miguel is in honor of the Archangel Michael, the patron saint, who is said to have appeared here. The center of the small community is a chapel from the 17th century, which has one nave, of three sections and a presbytery. The image of Michael inside is made of cornstalk paste. Michael is honored twice a year here, on 8 May, when he is said to have appeared and on 29 September, his usual feast day. These days are traditionally celebrated with mole rojo (red mole sauce), tamales, Chinelos, other indigenous and folk dance as well as traditional music. Another story from the area is that during the Mexican Revolution, Zapatista troops took control of the small church to use as a headquarters. Today, there is a small cannon which is said to have been left by these troops.

San Pedro Mártir is believed to have been founded by Franciscan friars during the early colonial period, with its chapel around the end of the 17th or early 18th century. This chapel has a simple portal with little decoration. The entrance arch has a niche with a sculpture of Saint Peter of Verona, the patron saint, with a cross at the crest. This chapel has a single nave with a vault covering it. Above the choir area, there is an Austrian eagle and a medallion with an image of the Archangel Michael. There is also an 18th-century sculpture of Saint Peter of Verona. The main altar contains a crucifix which also dates from the 18th century. The feast day of the patron saint is celebrated on 29 April with traditional dances such as Santiagos, Pastores, Arreiros and Chinelos. Many residents sustain themselves on ejido lands which they gained after the Mexican Revolution, growing staple crops such as corn and beans.

Santo Tomás Ajusco was founded in the early colonial period. Ajusco refers to the many fresh water springs which flow on the side of the Ajusco Mountain. The center of the town has a single nave church with a sculpture of Saint Thomas sculpted in wood, a crucifix made of ivory and an 18th-century sculpture of Saint James on horseback inside. The façade has three portals in sandstone with the center one decorated in plant motifs. The face also has three low reliefs. The atrium is paved with rock taken from the Tequipa pyramid. The feast day of the patron saint is 3 July.

In 2010, the city incorporated 175 hectares of forest in the borough as areas protected by the city in the areas around San Miguel Ajusco and Santo Tómas Ajusco. One reason for this was to put an end to territorial disputes between these two communities as well as with the neighboring community of Xalatlco in the State of Mexico for seventy years. Another reason is to combat continuing illegal logging and settlements.

<text>Xochimilco (; ) is a borough () of Mexico City. The borough is centered on the formerly independent city of Xochimilco, which was established on what was the southern shore of Lake Xochimilco in the precolonial period.

Today, the borough consists of the 18 , or neighborhoods, of this city along with 14 , or villages, that surround it, covering an area of . The borough is in the southeastern part of the city and has an identity that is separate from the historic center of Mexico City, due to its historic separation from that city during most of its history.

Xochimilco is best known for its canals, which are left from what was an extensive lake and canal system that connected most of the settlements of the Valley of Mexico. These canals, along with artificial islands called chinampas, attract tourists and other city residents to ride on colorful gondola-like boats called around the of canals. This canal and chinampa system, as a vestige of the area&#x27;s precolonial past, has made Xochimilco a World Heritage Site. In 1950, Paramahansa Yogananda, in his &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, wrote that if there were a scenic beauty contest, Xochimilco would get the first prize.

==The city and borough==

The borough of Xochimilco was created in 1928, when the federal government reorganized the Federal District of Mexico City into sixteen boroughs. The Xochimilco borough was centered on what was the city of Xochimilco, which had been an independent settlement from the pre-Hispanic period to the 20th century. The area&#x27;s historic separation from Mexico City proper remains in its culture. While officially part of the city, its identity is more like a suburb. This historic center was designated as a &quot;Barrio Mágico&quot; by the city in 2011. The borough is center-south of the historic center of Mexico City, and bordered by the boroughs of Tlalpan, Coyoacán, Tláhuac and Milpa Alta. It extends over , accounting for 8.4% of the Federal District&#x27;s territory. It is the third largest borough, after Tlalpan, and Milpa Alta. The borough has an emblem, also known as an &quot;Aztec glyph&quot;, which is a representation of the area&#x27;s spongy soil from which two flowering plants emerge. In spite of the serious environmental issues, 77.9% of the territory is designated as ecological reserve, 15.2% as residential and 4.6 as commercial and industrial.

The borough is divided into eighteen “barrios,” which make up the old city of Xochimilco and fourteen communities outside the traditional city called “pueblos.” The barrios are El Rosario, Santa Crucita, Caltongo, San Lorenzo, San Diego, La Asunción, San Juan, San Antonio, Belem, San Cristóbal, San Esteban, La Santísima, La Guadalupita, La Concepción Tlacoapa, San Marcos and Xaltocan, The fourteen pueblos are Santa María Tepepan, Santiago Tepalcatlalpan, San Mateo Xalpa, San Lorenzo Atemoaya, Santa Cruz Xochitepec, San Lucas Xochimanca, San Francisco Tlalnepantla, Santa María Nativitas, San Gregorio Atlapulco, Santiago Tulyehualco, San Luis Tlaxialtemalco, San Andrés Ahuayucan, Santa Cecilia Tepetlapa and San Cruz Acalpixca. There are also 45 smaller divisions called “colonias” and twenty major apartment complexes. The city acts as the local government for all the communities of the borough, whether part of the city or not. These offices are located on Calle Guadalupe I. Ramirez 4, in the El Rosario area. The borough has of primary roadway and of paved surface. Major thoroughfares include the Xochimilco-Tulyehualco road, Nuevo León, Periférico Sur, Avenida Guadalupe and Calzada México-Xochimilco. However, many of the areas of the borough are still semi-rural, with communities that still retain many old traditions and economic activities. For example, San Antonio Molotlán is noted for textiles and its Chinelos dancers. San Lorenzo Tlaltecpan is known for the production of milk and there are still a large number of stables in the area.

The most notable neighborhoods/communities include Xaltocan, Ejidos de Tepepan, La Noria, Las Cruces, Ejidos de Xochimilco and San Gregorio Atlapulco. San Francisco Caltongo is one of the oldest neighborhoods of the borough. Xaltocán began as a ranch or hacienda that belonged to the indigenous caciques. It was later donated to the San Bernardino de Siena monastery. After the monastery was secularized, it became hacienda land again, but over time, parts were sold and it became the current area of Xochimilco. The church for this community was built in 1751 as the hacienda chapel. Originally, it was dedicated to Jesus, then Candlemas and finally the Virgin of the Sorrows (Virgen de los Dolores). It officially became a sanctuary in 1951, declared by the archbishop of Mexico. In 1964, Xaltocán became a parish and in 1976, this church became the official parish church. The main celebration of the church is to an image of the Virgin Mary, which is said to have miraculously appeared in the pen of a turkey kept by an old woman.

In 2005, the borough had a population of 404,458, 4.6% of the total population of the Federal District. The growth rate is 1.8% for the past decade, lower than the decade previous. However, a large percentage of the borough&#x27;s population lives in poverty and many live illegally on ecological reserves, lacking basic services such as running water and drainage. In the past, houses in the area were constructed from adobe and wood from juniper trees, but today, most constructions are boxy cinderblock constructions, many of which are not painted. By the 2010 census its population had grown to 415,007 inhabitants, or 4.69% of Mexico City&#x27;s total.

What was the city of Xochimilco, now sometimes called the historic center of the borough, began as a pre-Hispanic city on the southern shore of Lake Xochimilco. After the Conquest, the Spanish built the San Bernardino de Siena monastery and church, which is still the center of the borough. The main street through the center of town, Guadalupe I.Ramirez, was originally a land bridge connecting this area, then on an island, to the causeway that led to Tenochtitlan (Mexico City). As the lake dried, the bridge became road, and it was called the Puente de Axomulco in the colonial era. It received its current name in the 1970s to honor a delegate of the borough. This town center also has a large plaza and to the side of this, a large area filled with street vendors, many selling ice cream. There is also a “Tianguis de Comida” or market filled with food stalls. This center underwent renovations in 2002 at a cost of sixty million pesos. Drainage and sidewalks were improved and security cameras installed. To improve the area&#x27;s look for tourists, businesses in the center agreed with the borough and INAH to change their façades to certain colors.

Much of the borough&#x27;s land is former lakebed. Its main elevations include Xochitepec and Tlacualleli mountains along with two volcanoes named Teutli and Tzompol. It contains two natural rivers called Santiago and Tepapantla along with the various canals, which is what is left of the lake. The elevated areas of the borough contain small forests of ocotes, strawberry trees, cedars, Montezuma cypress and a tree called a “tepozan.”

Xochimilco, along with other southern boroughs such as Milpa Alta and Tlalpan, have lower crime statistics than most other areas of the Federal District. However, crime, especially that related to kidnapping and drug trafficking has been on the rise, and more rural communities have taken to vigilante justice. Residents state that this is necessary because there is insufficient police protection. Xochimilco has only one policeman for each 550 residents on average, and there have been complaints that police have taken over 30 minutes to respond to calls. The borough has a population of 368,798, but only 670 police and 40 police cars. There was one case of vigilante justice in 1999, when a youth accused of robbery was caught and beaten by residents before handed over to police. But the police did not pursue the charge.

The Xochimilco Light Rail line, locally known as &quot;El Tren Ligero&quot;, of STE, provides light rail service connecting the borough to the Mexico City Metro system. Also home to carp and tilapia.

==Canals, chinampas and trajineras==

===Lake Xochimilco and the canal system===

Xochimilco is characterized by a system of canals, which measure about a total of 170 km2. These canals, and the small colorful boats that float on them among artificially created land called chinampas, are internationally famous. These canals are popular with Mexico City residents as well, especially on Sundays. These canals are all of what is left of what used to be a vast lake and canal system that extended over most parts of the Valley of Mexico, restricting cities such as Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) and Xochimilco to small islands. This system of waterways was the main transportation venue, especially for goods from the pre-Hispanic period until the 20th century. In the pre-Hispanic period, parts of the shallow lakes were filled in, creating canals. Starting in the early colonial period, the interconnected lakes of the valley, including Lake Xochimilco, were drained. By the 20th century, the lakes had shrunk to a system of canals that still connected Xochimilco with the center of Mexico City. However, with the pumping of underground aquifers since the early 20th century, water tables have dropped, drying canals, and all that are left are the ones in Xochimilco. The canals are fed by fresh water springs, which is artificially supplemented by treated water. This is because water tables are still dropping and human expansion and filling in of canals is still occurring, threatening to have the last of these canals disappear despite their importance to tourism.
These remaining canals and their ecosystem was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, with the purpose of saving them. An important part of this ecosystem is a willow tree called a “ahuejote” that is native to the shallow waters of the lake/canals. These stem erosion, act as wind breakers and favor the reproduction of a variety of aquatic species. Some of these endemic species include a freshwater crayfish called an acocil, and the Montezuma frog. However, the most representative animal from these waters is the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). This amphibian was used as a medicine, food and ceremonial object during the Aztec Empire. It was considered to be an incarnation of the god Xolotl, brother of Quetzalcoatl. It has been studied due to its abilities to regenerate limbs and other body parts. It can also reach sexual maturity as a larva, which no other amphibian can do. While mostly aquatic, it does have limited ability to breathe air. As of 2003, there were only 600 axolotls known to exist in the wild. Most of the threat to the species is loss of habitat and pollution, but the introduction of non-native fish such as tilapia has also had disastrous effects on the population of this and other species. Conservation efforts include research and environmental education. The Grupo de Investigación del Ajolote en Xochimilco (GIA-X) is a nonprofit research group dedicated to the preservation of the axolotl, which is in danger of extinction. It works to better understand the creature as well as with the local community to protect what is left of its habitat. In addition to species that live in the area year round, the wetlands here host about forty percent of the migratory bird species that arrive to Mexico, roughly 350, use the wet areas around Xochimilco for nesting. Many of these come from the United States and Canada. However, much of this habitat has been urbanized. About 700 species have been found in the area overall. Some of the migratory species include pelicans, storks, buzzards and falcons.
The destruction of the last of these canals began in the 1950s. At that time, groundwater pumping under the city center was causing severe subsidence. These wells were closed and new ones dug in Xochimilco and other southern boroughs. High rates of extraction have had the same effect on water tables and canals began to dry. Since then reclaimed wastewater has been recycled to flow into the Xochimilco canals to supplement water from natural sources. However, this water is not potable, containing bacteria and heavy metals and the canals still receive untreated wastewater and other pollution Another major problem, especially in the past two decades has been the population explosion of Mexico City, pushing urban sprawl further south into formerly rural areas of the Federal District. This prompted authorities to seek World Heritage Site status for the canals and the pre-Hispanic chinampa fields to provide them with more environmental protection.

 This was granted in 1987, but these same major environmental problems still exist. A 2006 study by UNESCO and Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana has shown that there are still very high levels of pollution (both garbage and fecal matter) in the canals and there still a rapid rate of deterioration 2,000 hectares of protected area. UNESCO has placed the most blame for the problems on the proliferation of illegal human settlements in the protected zone. Each year the borough loses six hectares of former lakebed to illegal settlements. According to the borough, about 90,000 people in Xochimilco live in illegal settlements, such as those in ecological zones, and 33,804 families live illegally on the chinampas. The most problematic are those closest to the canals, which cause the most pollution. The area is also sinking per year due to over pumping of groundwater, and canals are being filled in illegally. The deterioration is happening so fast, that UNESCO has threatened to pull Xochimilco World Heritage Site status.

Other major problems facing the canal system is the damage by introduced species and disease destroying native ones. Water lilies were introduced to the canals from Brazil in the 1940s. Since then, they have become a serious problem as their overgrowth depletes minerals and oxygen from the water. Up to 400 tons of the plant has been extracted from the canals monthly. In 2006, a Brazilian insect (Anthonomus grandis) was introduced to the canals to help control the plant. However, some need to be maintained because the axolotls are using them for reproduction purposes. Introduced species include carp and tilapia, which were introduced in the 1960s. However, these have been very detrimental to the native ecosystem, especially the axolotl, whose eggs they eat. Despite tons of the fish being caught in the canals, they are still a serious problem. Another major problem is the loss of trees, especially junipers in the ecological zone. Over sixty percent of the area is considered to be serious deforested and eighty percent of the junipers have the parasitic plant mistletoe.

Since being declared a World Heritage Site, there have been attempts to rescue the canal system. The first major effort occurred between 1989 and 1994, which was called the “Rescate Ecológico.” It had the goal of constructing a large artificial lake for tourism and sports covering 360 hectares, ten times the size of the lake in Chapultepec Park. These would be divided into two parts called the Ciénega Grande and Ciénega Chica on the side of the Periférico Sur. It would also include the creation of a chinampa zone and areas for culture and commerce and elevated buildings over the two sides of the Periférico Sur similar to those in the San Jerónimo area. However, this plan was stopped by agricultural communities in the area, which have a long history of defending their rights. However, since then, the area has been urbanized. It was replaced by a much smaller lake, with ecological area and plant market. In 2008, borough authorities began a reforestation program over 5,000 hectares of chinampas and forested areas at a cost of 20 million pesos. This program includes the cutting of non native species such as eucalyptus and certain pines and cedars to eradicate plagues associated with them. However, residents near forests such as in Nativitas oppose the cutting of healthy trees. These will be replaced by native species, especially junipers in the chinampa areas. However, it is still estimated that because of the continuance of urban sprawl, the remaining canals and protected land will disappear within fifty years.

===Chinampas===
The canals of Lake Xochimilco were initially created along with artificial agricultural plots called chinampas. Chinampas were invented by the pre-Hispanic peoples of the region around 1,000 years ago as a way to increase agricultural production. On the shallow waters of the lakes, rafts were constructed of juniper branches. Onto these rafts floating on the water, lakebed mud and soil were heaped and crops planted. These rafts, tied to juniper trees, would eventually sink and a new one be built to replace it. Over time, these sunken rafts would form square or rectangular islands, held in place in part by the juniper trees. As these chinampa islands propagated, areas of the lake were reduced to canals. These “floating gardens” were an important part of the economy of the Aztec Empire by the time the Spanish arrived.
Today, only about 5,000 chinampas, all affixed to the lake bottom, still exist in their original form, surrounded by canals and used for agriculture. The rest have become solid ground and urbanized. In the center of Xochimilco, there are about 200 chinampas, covering an area of 1,800 hectares. However, one reason the number has decreased is that smaller chinampas have been combined to create larger ones. While there are still those who maintain chinampas traditionally, and use them for agriculture, the chinampa culture is fading in the borough, with many being urbanized or turned into soccer fields and sites for housing and businesses. The deterioration of many of these chinampas can be seen as their edges erode into the dark, polluted water of the canals. The most deteriorated chinampas are located in the communities of Santa María Nativitas, Santa Cruz Acalpixca, San Gregoria Atlapulco, and Ejido de Xochimilco. Together, these have a total of thirty eight illegal settlements. To repair a number of chinampas, the borough, along with federal authorities, has reinforced of shoreline, of the that exist in the lake area. This involves the planting of juniper trees and the sinking of tezontle pylons into the lakebed.
These remaining chinampas are part of the Xochimilco World Heritage Site. Have since changed use and become residences and businesses. Those that remain agricultural are mostly used as nurseries, growing ornamental plants such as bougainvilleas, cactuses, dahlias, day lilies, and even bonsai. As they can produce up to eight times the amount of conventional land, they are still an important part of the borough&#x27;s agricultural production. There have been various attempts to save the remaining chinampas, including their cataloging by UNESCO, UAM, and INAH in 2005, and various reforestation efforts, especially of juniper trees.

===Island of the Dolls===

About an hour long canal ride from an embarcadero lies Isla de las Muñecas, or the Island of the Dolls. It is the best-known &quot;chinampa&quot;, or floating garden, in Xochimilco. It belonged to a man named Don Julián Santana Barrera, a native of the La Asunción neighborhood. Santana Barrera was a loner, who was rarely seen in most of Xochimilco. According to the legend, one early morning a young girl and her sisters went swimming in the canal but the current was too strong. The sisters got separated and the current pulled one of the sisters all the way down the canal when Santana Barrera discovered the young girl while she was drowning. When Santana finally got to her she was already dead. He also found a doll floating nearby and, assuming it belonged to the deceased girl, hung it from a tree as a sign of respect. After this, he began to hear whispers, footsteps, and anguished wails in the darkness even though his hut—hidden deep inside the woods of Xochimilco—was miles away from civilization. Driven by fear, he spent the next fifty years hanging more and more dolls, some missing body parts, all over the island in an attempt to appease what he believed to be the drowned girl&#x27;s spirit.

After Barrera&#x27;s death in 2001—his body reportedly found in the exact spot where he found the girl&#x27;s body fifty years before—the area became a popular tourist attraction where visitors bring more dolls. The locals describe it as &quot;charmed&quot;—not haunted—even though travelers claim the dolls whisper to them. The dolls are still on the island, which is accessible by boat. The island was featured on the Travel Channel show &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; and the Amazon Prime show &quot;Lore&quot;. It was also featured in &quot;BuzzfeedUnsolved&quot; where Ryan and Shane visited the island with a guide, who lead them around the island during the night. It was also featured on the show Expedition X in season 1 episode 3, where Phil Torres &amp; Jessica Chobot explore the mysteries of the island &amp; the dolls.

==History==

The name &quot;Xochimilco&quot; comes from Nahuatl and means &quot;flower field.&quot; This referred to the many flowers and other crops that were grown here on chinampas since the pre-Hispanic period.

The first human presence in the area was of hunter gatherers, who eventually settled into farming communities. The first settlements in the Xochimilco area were associated with the Cuicuilco, Copilco and Tlatilco settlements during the Classic period. The Xochimilca people, considered one of the seven Nahua tribes that migrated into the Valley of Mexico, first settled around 900 BC in Cuahilama, near what is now Santa Cruz Acalpixca. They worshipped sixteen deities, with Chantico, goddess of the hearth; Cihuacoatl, an earth goddess; and Amimitl, god of chinampas, the most important.

The Xochimilcas were farmers and founded their first dominion under a leader named Acatonallo. He is credited with inventing the chinampa system of agriculture to increase production. These chinampas eventually became the main producer, with crops such as corn, beans, chili peppers, squash, and more. The city of Xochimilco was founded in 919. Over time, it grew and began to dominate other areas on the south side of the lakes such as Mixquic, Tláhuac, Culhuacan and even parts of what is now the State of Morelos. Xochimilco had one woman ruler, which did not happen anywhere else in Mesoamerica in the pre-Hispanic period. She is credited with adding a number of distinctive dishes to the area&#x27;s cuisine, with inclusions such as necuatolli, chileatolli (atole with chili pepper), esquites and tlapiques.

In 1352, then emperor Caxtoltzin moved the city from the mainland to the island of Tlilan. In this respect it was like another island city in the area, Tenochtitlan. Although no longer an island, the city center is still in the same spot. In 1376, Tenochtitlan attacked Xochimilco, forcing the city to appeal to Azcapotzalco for help. The conquest was unsuccessful, but Xochimilco was then forced to pay tribute to Azcapotzalco. Tenochtitlan succeeded in conquering Xochimilco in 1430, while it was ruled by Tzalpoyotzin. Shortly thereafter, Aztec emperor Itzcoatl built the causeway or calzada that would connect the two cities over the lake. During the reign of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, the Xochimilcas contributed materials and manpower to construct a temple to Huitzilopochtli. They also participated in the further conquests of the Aztec Empire such as in Cuauhnáhuac (Cuernavaca), Xalisco and the Metztitlán and Oaxaca valleys. For their service, Ahuizotl, granted the Xochimilcas autonomy in their lands, and the two cities coexisted peacefully. Aztec emperors would pass by here on royal barges on their way to Chalco/Xico, then an island in Lake Chalco. For centuries Xochimilco remained relatively separate from Mexico City but provided much of the larger city&#x27;s produce.

Aztec emperor Moctezuma Xocoyotzin imposed a new governor, Omácatl, onto Xochimilco due to the arrival of the Spanish, but this governor was forced to return to Tenochtitlan, when the emperor was taken prisoner. He was then succeeded by Macuilxochitecuhtli, but eighty days later he too went to Tenochtitlan to fight the Spanish alongside Cuitláhuac. He was followed by Apochquiyautzin, who remained loyal to Tenochtitlan. For this reason, Hernán Cortés decided to send armies to subdue Xochimilco before taking Tenochtitlan. This occurred on 16 April 1521. During the battle, Cortés was almost killed when he fell off his horse, but he was saved by a soldier named Cristóbal de Olea. The battle was fierce and left few Xochimilca warriors alive. The invaders later raped and pillaged the city. According to legend, it was after this battle that Cuauhtémoc came to Xochimilco and planted a juniper tree in the San Juan neighborhood to commemorate the event.

Pre-Hispanic Xochimilco was an island connected to the mainland by three causeways. One of these still exists in the form of Avenida Guadalupe I.Ramirez, one of the city&#x27;s main streets. This causeway led to the main ceremonial center of the town, which was called the Quilaztli. The Spanish destroyed the Quilaztli during the Conquest, and replaced it with the San Bernardino de Siena Church, which would become the social and political center of the colonial city. The city in turn, was the most important settlement in the south of the Valley of Mexico in the colonial era. It became a settlement of Spanish, criollos and mestizos, with the indigenous living in rural communities outside of the city proper.

During the Siege of Tenochtitlan, Hernán Cortés attacked the city and the &quot;great number of warriors&quot; in it. During the battle, Cortes was knocked from his horse, and almost captured by the Mexicans. The following day, Guatemoc sent ten thousand warriors by land and two thousand by canoe to attack the Spaniards, followed by ten thousand reinforcements. The Mexicans were defeated, and Cortes was able to capture five Mexican captains. Cortes then proceeded with his march.

After the Conquest, Apochquiyauhtzin, the last lord of Xochimilco, was baptized with the name of Luís Cortés Cerón de Alvarado in 1522 and he was allowed to continue governing under the Spanish. Evangelization was undertaken here by Martín de Valencia with a number of others who are known as the first twelve Franciscans in Mexico. Their monastery was built between 1534 and 1579, along with many chapels and churches in the Xochimilco area, a hospital in Tlacoapa and a school. Xochimilco was made an encomienda of Pedro de Alvarado in 1521 and remained such until 1541.

The Spanish used the lakes and canals of the Valley of Mexico much as the indigenous did, at least at first. Xochimilco remained an important agricultural area, shipping its produce to Mexico City in the same ways. However, problems with flooding, especially the Great Flood of 1609 in Mexico City and Xochimilco, spurred the Spanish to begin projects to drain the lakes. As a result, these lakes, including Lake Xochimilco, has suffered one of the most radical transformations in the history of urbanization. Five hundred years ago, the lake extended and contained of chinampas and of canals. Today, there are only of chinampas and of canals, and they are still disappearing.

Xochimilco was granted the title of city by Felipe II in 1559. Through much of the colonial era, the city&#x27;s native population was decimated by epidemics, especially typhoid. Despite this, and because of the apparent acceptance of Christianity, the Xochimilcas were permitted to retain a number of their traditions and their identity as a people. The area remained mostly indigenous for much of the colonial period. Its importance as an agricultural center with easy access to Mexico City meant that in the 17th century, about two thousand barges a day still traveled on the waters that separated the two areas.

In 1749, Xochimilco became a &quot;corregimiento&quot; or semi-autonomous area from Mexico City and would remain so until Independence. It would also increase in importance as a stopover for those traveling between Mexico City and Cuernavaca. Also during this time, Xochimila Martín de la Cruz, wrote Xihuipahtli mecéhual amato, better known as the Aztec Herbal Book or the Cruz-Badiano Codex. It is the oldest book on medicine written on the American continent. It was translated into Latin by Juan Badiano. The original is in the Vatican.

After Independence, Xochimilco became a municipality in what was then the State of Mexico. It would later become a part of the Federal District of Mexico City after the Mexican–American War, when this district was expanded.

Manuel Payno in his novel &quot;Los bandidos del río Frio&quot; related a journey through here between San Lázaro and Chalco. In 1850, the first steam-powered boat traveled through here, connecting Mexico City with Chalco. Steam powered ships remained in Xochimilco waters from then until the 1880s, when they faded from use. Before, during and after, Xochimilco continued to make more traditional rafts, canoes and trajineras, pushed along the shallow waters by a pole.

Up through the centuries, the valley lakes continued to shrink but there were still canals that linked Xochimilco to the center of Mexico City. In the late 19th century, Mexico City had outgrown its traditional water supplies and began to take water from the springs and underground aquifers of Xochimilco. Degradation of the lakes was fastest in the early 20th century, when projects such as the Canal del Desagüe were built to further drain the valley. This and excessive aquifer pumping lowered water tables and canals near Mexico City center dried up and cut off an inexpensive way to get goods to market for Xochimilco. This had a major effect on the area&#x27;s economy, along with the effects of the loss of fishing for communities such as Santa Cruz Acalpixca, San Gregorio Atlapulco and San Luis Tlaxialtemalco.(rescartarlo) In 1908, an electric tram serves was inaugurated that was supposed to reach Tulyehualco, but never did.

During the Mexican Revolution, the first Zapatistas came into the borough through Milpa Alta. They burned areas in Nativitas and San Lucas in 1911 and then stayed without further attacks. They then took the city of Xochimilco in 1912, burning the southern part. The Zapatistas then controlled most of what is now the borough. On 23 April 1913, 39 youths were shot to death in a small alley in San Lucas Xochimanca. A plaque commemorates the site. When the Zapatistas were confronted by troops loyal to Venustiano Carranza in Cuemanco, they damaged pumps and set the center of Xochimilco and the original municipal palace on fire. In 1914, Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata met in San Gregorio and signed an alliance called the Pact of Xochimilco.

After the war, Xochimilco became a borough when the Federal District was reorganized, including the communities of Mixquic, San Juan Ixtayopan and Tetelco. These and other territories would be lost and its final dimensions attained in 1931.

In the 1920s, Xochimilco lost control of most of its water supply, taken by the city for its needs. The urban sprawl of Mexico City reached Xochimilco in the mid 20th century and it still affects the borough today. In the 1970s, the federal government began to replace the lost supply to the canals with treated water from the nearby Cerro de la Estrella. This is most of the water that now flows in the canals. The treated water is clear, but not potable due to bacteria and heavy metals. However, it is used to irrigate crops grown on the chinampas, even though the canals are further polluted by untreated sewage and garbage. The biggest threat to the canals and their ecosystem is uncontrolled sprawl, mostly due to illegal building on conservation land. These settlements are polluting canals with untreated garbage and waste, and filling in canals to make &quot;new land.&quot; There are thirty-one illegal settlements in the historic center, with 2,700 constructions. Ten of these are in the chinampas of San Gregorio Atlapulco, San Luis Tlaxialtemalco, Santa Cruz Acalpixca, and Santa María Nativitas. The borough and UNESCO are at odds over what to do about the 450 hectares of illegal settlements. UNESCO demands their eviction, but the borough says this would be too difficult and better to legalize the settlements, putting efforts into preventing more.

==Religion==

From the pre-Hispanic period to the present, religion has pervaded the life of people in this region. Since it was imposed in the early 16th century, the Catholic religion has permeated and molded popular culture. As in other parts of Mexico, indigenous beliefs and practices, such as those of the Xochimilca, were not completely eradicated. Instead, many were integrated and readapted to Catholicism. One example of this is the building of churches over former temples and other sacred sites. These churches&#x27; decorations often have indigenous elements as well. Despite the fact that 91% of the population self identifies as Catholic, there are still many indigenous traditions related to the agricultural cycle. A more important syncretism has been the many religious festivals that occur through the year, and the means by which these festivals are sponsored and organized. Much of religious practice in the borough is through symbolic processes that work to produce a kind of social cohesion. The most visible of these are the large civic/religious festivals.

There is some religious plurality in the borough although they represent a very small minority of the population. There are thirty six non-Catholic congregations in the borough with about seventy places of worship. Almost all are Protestant or Evangelical groups established by missionaries, mostly from the United States. The first was established 120 years ago, but most have been established in the last twenty years, with a small but growing number of followers. However, since almost all social activity is related to this popular Catholic festival calendar, intolerance of religious minorities generally takes the subtle form of being excluded from events, although a number of non-Catholics participate in festivities anyway.

These mostly religious festivals and other traditions have been maintain despite the urbanization of the borough. The calendar of celebrations here is extensive. Some are civic or political events such as Independence Day or local celebrations such as the birth of poet Fernando Celada, the birth of Quirino Mendoza y Cortés, composer of “Cielito Lindo,” and the commemoration of the meeting of Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata on December 4 in this area. However, most events are tied to religious activity and tradition, organized by volunteers called mayordomos. The mayordomia system is the most important social structure in the borough. The primary task of these volunteers is to sponsor and organized any many religious festivals and celebrations that occur through the year, as well as other duties. This may be paid for by collecting donations or paid for directly by the mayordomo. There are 422 officially recognized festivals during the year, including those local to specific communities. One of these more localized festivals is on May 3, Day of the Holy Cross, which has been celebrated in communities such as Santa Cruz Xochitepec (or Magdalena Xochitepec), Santa Cruz Acalpixcan and the center of Xochimilco for over 400 years.

However, the best known mayordomo position is not for a festival, but rather for the care of an image of the child Jesus called the Niñopa. The image is over 435 years old and has a following of about 25,000 in the Xochimilco area. It measures and weighs less than a kilo. The name “Niñopa” comes from the Spanish word “niño” (child) and the Nahuatl suffix “-pan” (place) to mean “child of the place.” The image was thought to have been made of orange tree wood, but this was proven false when the image was dropped and a finger damaged, allowing for the taking of a small sample. The analysis showed that it was made in the local area of a tree called a chocolín, in the 16th or 17th century. The prestige for becoming a mayordomo for the Niñopa is so great, that the waiting time to become one is decades long. The mayordomo receives nothing for the care of the image and pays all expenses out of pocket, which includes building rooms for the image to stay, and sponsoring the nearly daily events dedicated to this image. The annual cycle begin on February 2, when the image is received by a new mayordomo. During the year, the image visits homes and hospitals, accompanied by Chinelos dancers. In addition to the Niñopan, other important child Jesus figures include the Niño Dormidito in the Xaltocan neighborhood, the Niño de Belen at the Salitre Embarcadero, the Niño Tamalerito, and the Niño de San Juan. These images, along with the Niñopan, are celebrated together on April 30, at an event called the Niños Sagrados. There are various replicas of the Niñopa, which are owned by former mayordomos.

Fifteen of the eighteen pueblos of Xochimilco hold major events for Day of the Dead, including costume parades, exhibitions, especially of altars, in cemeteries, museums, plazas and more. The Dolores Olmedo Museum has an annual monumental altar to the dead for the occasion As per traditions, the cemeteries of smaller communities such as San Francisco Tlalnepantla, Santa Cruz Xochitepec and Santa María Nativitas are lit with the glow of numerous candles and loved ones sit vigil over the graves. The best known event associated with Day of the Dead is the “la Cihuacoatle, Leyenda de la Llorona,” which is a spectacle based on the La Llorona spectre, which runs from late October to mid November. It takes place on the waters of the old Tlilac Lake. Spectators watch the event from trajineras that depart from the Cuemanco docks and travel the canals to reach the lake. Another similar performance is called “Retorno al Mictlan “or Return to Mictlan, the Aztec land of the Dead, which is performed in the historic center of Xochimilco.

After the Conquest, Spaniards began to build churches and monasteries in the various villages in what is now the borough. Typical of these is the monastery at Santa María Tepepan, constructed between 1525 and 1590. Today, Xochimilco has nine parishes and five rectories. The most important of this is also the first church established in the area, the San Bernardino de Siena church and former monastery founded by Martín de Valencia. The current church building was constructed between 1535 and 1590 under the direction of Francisco de Soto, but the cloister and monastery area were not finished until the early 17th century. In 1609, a monastery school was founded at the site with classes in rhetoric, theology and arts and letters. Most of the funding of the project came from indigenous leaders of the area, especially Martín Cerónde de Álvaro. In 1538, the Church wanted to bring the complex&#x27;s Franciscans into Mexico City, but the local people opposed and won. However, in 1569, there were still only four monks serving over 5,000 native people. Soon after, the indigenous population was organized into neighborhoods for indoctrination and census purposes: Santiago Tepalcatlalpan, San Lucas Xochimanca, San Mateo Pochtla, San Miguel Topilejo, San Francisco Tlalnepantla, San Salvador Cuautenco, Santa Cecilia Ahuautla, San Andrés Ocoyoacac, San Lorenzo Tlatecpan, San Martín Tiatilpan, Santa Maria Nativitas Zacapan y Santa Cruz Acalpixcan. Major restoration work was done on the church in its decorative elements in the 1970s. This also included removing two schools that had been established on the large atrium area as well as banning commercial activities from the same.

The church maintains is very large atrium, which was common to monasteries during the evangelization efforts of the very early colonial period. These atriums were meant to hold large congregations of indigenous peoples, who were ministered to by very few monks. The side gate of the atrium has a mixture of Plateresque, Gothic and indigenous feature. The west gate has three arches, which represent the Spanish, indigenous and mestizo peoples of the area. This was the space where the first baptisms of the indigenous were done. The church/monastery complex is tall and has a fortress appearance, again something common for the time period.

The church interior conserves its original 16th-century main altar, with four stories tall, contains indigenous, Italian, Flemish and Spanish influence and is covered in 24karat gold leaf. It contains a relief of San Bernardino surrounded by two groups of indigenous sculptures, who are helping to build the church. Above San Bernardino, there is a depiction of the Virgin of the Assumption and the Virgin of Xochimilco. The paintings represent episodes from the life of Jesus and have been attributed to Simon Pereyns and Andrés de la Concha. This is one of the few 16th-century altarpieces to have survived and the only one similar to it in size and construction is located in the monastery in Huejotzingo, Puebla.

There are seven other altarpieces, which date from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The one dedicated to Christ on the north side is from the 16th century, but it is incomplete at its base and sides. The one dedicated to the Holy Family dates from either the 17th or 18th century. Another dedicated to Christ on the south side is from the 16th or 17th century. One dedicated to Martin de Porres is notable because it has no columns.

The church&#x27;s only chapel serves as a tabernacle. This room contains a large painting of Calvary. There are also a large number of notable paintings by names such as Echave Orio, Simón Pereyns, Sánchez Salmerón Caravaggio, Francisco Martínez, Luis Arciniegas and Juan Martínez Monteñés. The baptismal fonts are decorated in acanthus leaves, among which is a pre-Hispanic style skull. The organ is Baroque from the 17th century. The pews are made of red cedar as are the two pulpits, all made by Juan Rojas in the 18th century.

The San Pedro Tlalnahuac Church was one of the first “poza” chapels (used for processions) built in Xochimilco, dating from 1533. The main church has a masonry façade. In front, a small paved yard contains a cross sculpted in wood and sandstone. A significant number of pre-Hispanic artifacts have been found on the grounds. It is located on Calle Pedro Ramírez del Castillo.

The La Asunción Colhuacatzinco Church is Neoclassical with arches serving as buttresses. It main altar is modern, from the end of the 20th century. This church is important due to its association with a number of traditions including the Burning of Judas on Easter Sunday and fireworks on frames called toritos. Good Friday is dedicated to the Holy Burial, with mayordomos sponsoring breakfast. It is located in the La Asunción neighborhood.

The Santa Crucita de Analco Church was first built in 1687 then rebuilt in Neoclassical style in 1860. Its main altar is modern. It has a chapel in which a number of films have been shot including one called María Candelaria.

The San Juan Bautista Tlateuhchi Church is fronted by a large juniper tree said to have been planted by Cuauhtémoc to commemorate the alliance of the Xochimilas with the Aztecs to fight the Spanish. The church has been through a number of restorations. It is located in the historic center of Xochimilco.

The Santa María de los Dolores Xaltocan Church is a Neoclassical building but its main altar is Plateresque and Baroque. This church is hosts a 20-day celebration of Carnival long with the surrounding neighborhoods and markets.

The Belem Church in the historic center dates from 1758. It has been renovated several times, with the last time in 1932.

The La Concepción de María Tlacoapa Church was originally part of a hospital, built by the Franciscans in the 17th century.

The El Rosario Nepantlatlaca is a chapel unique to the area, as its façade is decorated with tiles. It contains a notable painting of Saint Christopher from the 17th century. Originally, the chapel was dedicated to Saint Margaret. It was declared a Historic Monument in 1932.

The Francisco Caltongo Church is one of the farthest from the historic center of the borough in the Caltongo neighborhood. Its façade has a number of pre-Hispanic elements even though it was built in 1969.

The La Santisima Trinidad Chililico Church is noted for its equestrian statue of Saint James as well as its collection of documents related to Xochimilco&#x27;s history. It is located in the La Santisima neighborhood.

The San Esteban Tecpanpan Church was built on the site of a pre-Hispanic palace and ceremonial center. The current building was constructed in the middle of the 19th century. This building lost its original vault, but it was rebuilt in 1959 along with the bell tower. It is located in the San Esteban neighborhood.

The San Cristóbal Xalan Church is located in the San Cristóbal neighborhood, which is known for floriculture, including poppies that were brought from Europe. Since it blooms in spring, there was a day dedicated to the red poppy called the “Lunes de amapolas,“ which is the day after Easter Sunday. However, this tradition ended when poppy cultivation was banned in 1940.

The San Lorenzo Tlaltecpan Church is located in the San Lorenzo neighborhood, once known for its fishermen. They still specialize in a tamale with fish.

==Non-religious festivals==

There are forty nine important mostly secular festivals through the year, with the most important being the Feria de la Nieve, Feria de la Alegría y el Olivo, and the Flor más Bellas del Ejido. The “Flor más Bella del Ejido” (Most Beautiful Flower of the Ejido or Field) pageant is a borough-wide event dedicated to the beauty of Mexican indigenous women. The origins of this event are traced back over 220 years with symbolism that is based on the pre-Hispanic notion of a “flower-woman” representative of Mother Earth and fertility. This flower-woman is based on the goddess Xochiquetzal, the goddess of flowers and love, robbed from her husband Tlaloc by Tezcatlipoca. After the Conquest, this “flower-woman” symbol survived and would appear at certain Catholic festivals such as the Viernes de Dolores, or the Friday before Palm Sunday. An official pageant dedicated to this was established in 1786. Originally, its purpose was religious but it eventually became secularized. For this reason, the event was moved to a week before the Viernes de Dolores and then called the Viernes de las Amapolas. The event existed in this form for 170 years, with dancing, food, pulque, charros and pageants featuring china poblanas. In 1902, the tradition diminished as the last of the canals connecting the area with the Jamaica market closed. In 1921, the El Universal newspaper held a beauty pageant for the 100th anniversary of the end of the Mexican War of Independence, calling it “La India Bonita” dedicated to indigenous women. The first winner was María Bibiana Uribe. In 1936, another pageant was created for mestizo women called “la Flor Más Bella del Ejido” or the Most Beautiful Flower of the Ejido, which occurred each year on the Viernes de Dolores in the Santa Anita area. This event was moved to San Andres Mixquic in the 1950s, but the lack of crowds had it move again in 1955 to Xochimilco, where it remains.

The Feria de Nieve (Ices and Ice cream Fair) takes place in Santiago Tulyehualco each April. Flavored snow was consumed in the pre Hispanic period, eaten by the rich and made from snow from the nearby mountains and transported through this area. The consumption of this flavored snow continued into the colonial era and the first fair dedicated to it was established in 1529 by Martín de Valencia. The fair was celebrated sporadically until 1885 when there was renewed interest in it, making it an annual event. In 2009, the event had its 124th anniversary. During this time, new flavors and types of frozen confections have been invented. Some of the flavors are uncommon, such as rose petal, pulque, mole, spearmint, lettuce, shrimp and tequila. Many of these were developed by local resident Faustino Cicilia Mora.

The community of Santiago Tepalcatlalpan holds an annual corn festival, as it is still a significant producer of this crop. This event is called the Feria del Maiz y la Tortilla (Corn and Tortilla Fair) in May. It focuses on the traditional methods of preparing and eating the grain, such as in tortillas, gorditas, sopes, quesadillas, tlacoyos with various fillings and atole, especially a version flavored with chili peppers.

The Feria de la Alegría y el Olivo (“Alegria” and Olive Fair) has been an annual event since the 1970s in Santiago Tulyehualco. It is mostly based on a grain native to Mexico called amaranth. An “alegria” is a sweet made with this grain, honey with dried fruits and nuts sometimes added. However, the term is also used to refer to the plant that produces amaranth. An “olivo” is an olive tree. Amaranth was an important part of the pre-Hispanic diet, due to its nutritive qualities and its use in various ceremonies. This annual fair is dedicated to elaboration of this sweet along with olive products from the area. Over 250 producers of the grain offer their products in various preparations. There are also cultural events such as concerts.

The Feria Nacional del Dulce Cristalizado (National Crystallized Candy Fair) takes place each year in the Santa Cruz Acalpixca community at the Plaza Civica. This fair is dedicated to a traditional sweet of various fruits and sometimes plants, which are conserved in a sugar solution until they crystallize. These include squash, pineapple, nopal cactus, tomatoes, chili peppers, figs and more. These traditional sweets are often sold alongside others such as coconut confections, palanquetas de cacahuate (similar to peanut brittle), and nuez con leche (a nut-milk confection). These candies are the result of a blending of pre-Hispanic and European sweet traditions. The main European contributions are sugar and milk products, which are often mixed with native or other introduced ingredients. Originally, fruits and other foods were crystallized this way for conservation. Many in the community of Santa Cruz Acalpixca specialize in the making of one or more of these sweets, which began in 1927 with two shops belonging to Santiago Ramírez Olvera and Aurelio Mendoza in the Tepetitla neighborhood. In the 1980s, the town decided to hold an annual fair to promote their products, which originally was held in conjunction with the festival to the local patron saint. The event includes prizes for the best confections in several categories and the introduction of new types of candies.

Other events include the Carnival of Xochimilco, which was begun in 2004, to rescue the carnival tradition in the area. It consists of a series of musical concerts of various types, art exhibits, food and crafts displays and plays for children. There are also fairs dedicated to rabbits and poinsettias, as well as local civic celebrations to honor events such as the birth of poet Fernando Celada, the birth of Quirino Mendoza y Cortés, composer of “Cielito Lindo,” and the commemoration of the meeting of Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata on December 4 in this area.

Xochimilco has also traditionally held the Oktoberfest at the Club Alemán, which is located in the borough.

In Xochimilco was made film &quot;Sin Azul&quot;. Úrsula Murayama appeared in that film as Laura.

==Economy==
Since the pre-Hispanic period, Xochimilco&#x27;s economy has traditionally been based on agriculture, mostly by supplying to the needs of Mexico City. This not only dominated the economy but also the area&#x27;s religious practices, some of which can still be seen to the present day. Agriculture still remains important in the borough, but most of the focus has shifted to flowers and ornamental plants. One major reason for this is the poor quality of the area&#x27;s water supply. Xochimilco has four major markets dedicated to the sale of plants and flowers: Cuemanco, Palacio de la Flor, Mercado de Madre Selva and the historic market at San Luis Tlaxialtemalco. Cuemanco is the largest in Xochimilco and the largest of its kind in Latin America, covering thirteen hectares, with its own cactus garden and forms part of the ecological preserve of Cuemanco. The borough produces 2.5 million poinsettias each year, accounting for most of the 3.5 million sold each year in Mexico City. This represents an income for the borough of about 25 to 30 million pesos annually, grown by about 10,000 growers.

However, starting in the later 20th century, most of area&#x27;s economy has shifted away from agriculture. One reason for this is the deterioration of the area&#x27;s environment. Plagues and poor planning have gravely affected the conservation area in Xochimilco, to the extent that many fruit trees traditionally grown here have disappeared, including capulins and peaches. Over the last forty years, the percentage of people in the borough working in agriculture has dropped from forty percent to three percent.

Xochimilco still has 3,562 units of agricultural production, accounting for 17.7% of the total of the Federal District. These cover 2,741.4 hectares of land or 11.4% of the District. 2741.4 hectares is farmland, with a much smaller amount dedicated to fishing and forestry. Xochimilco accounts for 90.8 percent of the flower production of the District, 76.9% of poinsettias, and all of the geraniums and roses grown here. It also grows about 40% of the District&#x27;s spinach crop, 24.6 of the figs, 8.7 of pears, 13.2 of pears and 9% of plums. As a producer of livestock, Xochimilco accounts for 36% of the cattle, 29.8% of the pig, 17.2 of sheep and 27.8% of the domestic fowl production of the District.

Most of the employed are in manufacturing (23.5%) commerce (39,7%) and services (33.3%). Over 91% of all businesses in the borough are related to commerce and services. However, manufacturing contributes to 61.8% of the borough GDP, with commerce at 18.9% and services at 18%. After agriculture, the most visible economic activity is tourism, which is considered part of commerce and services. The canals, chinampas and trajineras are the borough&#x27;s main tourist attraction. In February 2011, trajinera operators protested the existence of “clandestine” tour operators supposedly tolerated by authorities. There are supposedly as many as twenty five or thirty of these who pay bribes of 500 pesos a month to operate away from the six embarcaderos authorized by the borough. Relative to the rest of the city, Xochimilco has a negligible amount of hotel infrastructure. There are no five star hotels. There are 183 four-star and 98 three-star hotels, but they represent only two percent and one percent respectively of the total for the city.

==Other landmarks==

Aside from the canals and trajineras, the best-known attraction in Xochimilco is the Dolores Olmedo Museum. This museum was once the home of socialite Dolores Olmedo. Before this, it was the main house of the La Noria Hacienda, established in the 17th century. Before she died, Ms. Olmedo decided to donate her house, much of what was in it and her art collection to the public as a museum. The buildings are surrounded by gardens planted with native Mexican species, around which wander peacocks. Another area houses a number of xoloitzcuintle dog. The museum&#x27;s collection includes about 600 pre Hispanic pieces, the largest collection of works by Diego Rivera at 140 pieces, as well as a number of works by Frida Kahlo and Angelina Beloff. It also contains rooms filled with furniture, items from many parts of the world and everyday items used by Olmedo and her family. In November, the museum set up a monumental altar to the dead.

The Museo Arqueológico de Xochimilco (Archeological Museum of Xochimilco) began as a collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts such as ceramics, stone items, bones, and more that had been found in the area, often during construction projects. In 1965, the museum began to display these items to the public. In 1974, the collection moved permanently to a late 19th-century house, which was restored in the 1980s and inaugurated under its current name. This collection contains 2,441 pieces, mostly ceramic and stone objects, including figures, cooking utensils, arrowheads. It is located on Avenida Tenochtitlán in Santa Cruz Acalpixca. Located to one side is one of the fresh water springs that feed the canals. On the other sides are gardens.

Near the archeological museum is a site called Cuahilama. It is a hill that rises about fifty meters above the lakebed. The site consists of terraces and twelve petroglyphs that date to about 1500. The most important of these is called the Nahualapa, a map that contains the locations of 56 sources of water, Lake Xochimilco, eight buildings and a large quantity of roads and paths.
As much of the borough is still classified as an ecological reserve, there are a number of green areas open to the public. These include several “forests” such as the Bosque de Nativitas, the Xochimilco Ecological Reserve, the Centro Acuexcomatl, and Michmani Ecotourism Park. There are several parks designated as forests such as the Bosque de Nativitas and the Bosque de San Luis Tlaxialtemaco. These are considered “areas of environmental value” by the city and established to counter some of the damage caused by urban sprawl in Xochimilco. These areas are open to the public but with minimal services such as picnic tables and horseback riding. The largest ecological area is the Xochimilco Ecological Reserve, inaugurated in 1993. It covers over 200 hectares and is filled with numerous plant and animal species that live or migrate here. The park also contains a bike path, thirty five athletic fields, a flower market and a visitor center. It is second in size only to Chapultepec Park. It is also possible to travel in some of the canals here by trajinera. The Centro de Educación Ambiental Acuexcomatl (Acuexcomatl Environmental Education Center) is located on the road between Xochimilco center and Tulyehualco. It contains fish farms, beekeeping, plant nurseries and greenhouses as well as sports facilities, classrooms, workshops, an auditorium, an open-air theatre and a cafeteria. It is in Colonia Quirino Mendoza. Michmani is an ecotourism program sponsored by the borough, which is situated on fifty hectares of chinampas. The site offers kayaking, recreational fishing, a temazcal, cabin rentals and environmental education.

The crater of the Teoca volcano has a sports facility with jai alai, gymnasiums and a soccer field.

The Virgilio Uribe rowing course was built for the 1968 Olympics in one of the canals. It measures 2,000m long and wide. It is still used for canoeing, kayaking, and rowing.

==Education==

The borough contains 116 preschools, 128 primary schools, 48 middle schools, four technical high schools and 15 high schools that serve a student population of over 100,000 students. 4.6 percent of the population is illiterate, lower than the city average. The highest percentage of illiterate people consists of those over sixty years of age. The lowest is in the 15-19-year-old bracket.

===Post-secondary education===
The Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana was established in 1974 in Xochimilco under Mexican president Luis Echeverría to meet the growing demand for public university education in the city. Currently, the institution has three campuses in the Federal District, in Azcapotzalco, Iztapalapa and Xochimilco and it is composed of several academic divisions. These divisions include the División de Ciencias y Artes para el Diseño, División de Ciencias Biológicas y de la Salud and the División de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades. The institution offers about twenty bachelor&#x27;s degrees, an equal number of master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees as well as a number of certificate programs.

The Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (National School of Fine Arts) was originally established as the San Carlos Academy in the historic center of Mexico City during the late colonial era in 1781. The school became the most prestigious art academy in Mexico after Independence in the 19th century. In 1910, the school was incorporated into the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. In the 1970s, the school divided into an undergraduate and graduate division and in 1979, the undergraduate division moved to a new campus in Xochimilco, leaving the graduate studies at the traditional site in the historic center. ENAP remains as the country&#x27;s largest and most prestigious art education institution.

===Primary and secondary schools===
National public high schools of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) &quot;Escuela Nacional Preparatoria&quot; include:
* &quot;Escuela Nacional Preparatoria Plantel 1 &quot;Gabino Barreda&quot;&quot;

Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
* &quot;Escuela Preparatoria Xochimilco &quot;Bernardino de Sahagún&quot;&quot;

The Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt has its Campus Sur/Campus Süd (formerly Campus Xochimilco) in the district. The Kindergarten and primary levels occupy the Plantel Tepepan in Colonia Tepepan and the secondary and preparatory levels occupy the Plantel La Noria in Colonia Huichapan (La Noria).

<text>A (, ; , ) is generally any lyric-driven French song. The term is most commonly used in English to refer either to the secular polyphonic French songs of late medieval and Renaissance music or to a specific style of French pop music which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. The genre had origins in the monophonic songs of troubadours and trouvères, though the only polyphonic precedents were 16 works by Adam de la Halle and one by Jehan de Lescurel. Not until the &quot;ars nova&quot; composer Guillaume de Machaut did any composer write a significant number of polyphonic chansons.

A broad term, the word &quot;chanson&quot; literally means &quot;song&quot; in French and can thus less commonly refer to a variety of (usually secular) French genres throughout history. This includes the songs of chansonnier, &quot;chanson de geste&quot; and Grand chant; court songs of the late Renaissance and early Baroque music periods, &quot;air de cour&quot;; popular songs from the 17th to 19th century, &quot;bergerette&quot;, &quot;brunette&quot;, &quot;chanson pour boire&quot;, &quot;pastourelle&quot;, and vaudeville; art song of the romantic era, &quot;mélodie&quot;; and folk music, &#x27;. Since the 1990s, the term may be used forNouvelle Chanson, a French song that often contains poetic or political content.

== High medieval precedents ==
=== &quot;Chanson de geste&quot; ===

The earliest &quot;chansons&quot; were the epic poems performed to simple monophonic melodies by a professional class of &quot;jongleurs&quot; or &quot;ménestrels&quot;. These usually recounted the famous deeds (&quot;geste&quot;) of past heroes, legendary and semi-historical. The &quot;Song of Roland&quot; is the most famous of these, but in general the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; are studied as literature since very little of their music survives.

=== &quot;Chanson courtoise&quot; ===

The &quot;chanson courtoise&quot; or &quot;grand chant&quot; was an early form of monophonic &quot;chanson&quot;, the chief lyric poetic genre of the trouvères. It was an adaptation to Old French of the Occitan &quot;canso&quot;. It was practised in the 12th and 13th centuries. Thematically, as its name implies, it was a song of courtly love, written usually by a man to his noble lover. Some later &quot;chansons&quot; were polyphonic and some had refrains and were called &quot;chansons avec des refrains&quot;.

==Late medieval and early Renaissance==
=== &quot;Formes fixes&quot; ===

In its typical specialized usage, the word &quot;chanson&quot; refers to a polyphonic French song of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Early &quot;chansons&quot; tended to be in one of the &quot;formes fixes&quot;—ballade, rondeau or virelai (formerly the &quot;chanson baladée&quot;)—though some composers later set popular poetry in a variety of forms. The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, with first three becoming the norm, expanding to four voices by the 16th century. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by instruments.

The first important composer of &quot;chansons&quot; was Guillaume de Machaut, who composed three-voice works in the &quot;formes fixes&quot; during the 14th century.

=== Burgundian &quot;chanson&quot; ===
Two composers from Burgundy, Guillaume Du Fay and Gilles Binchois, who wrote so-called Burgundian &quot;chansons&quot;, dominated the subsequent generation of chanson composers (). Their chansons, while somewhat simple in style, are also generally in three voices with a structural tenor. These works are typically still 3 voices, with an active upper voice (discantus) pitched above two lower voices (tenor and altus) usually sharing the same range. Musicologist David Fallows includes the Burgundian repertoire in &quot;A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs 1415–1480.&quot;

==Mid-late Renaissance &quot;chanson&quot;==
Later 15th- and early 16th-century figures in the genre included Johannes Ockeghem and Josquin des Prez, whose works cease to be constrained by &quot;formes fixes&quot; and begin to feature a pervading imitation (all voices sharing material and moving at similar speeds), similar to that found in contemporary motets and liturgical music. The first book of music printed from movable type was &quot;Harmonice Musices Odhecaton&quot;, a collection of ninety-six chansons by many composers, published in Venice in 1501 by Ottaviano Petrucci.

=== Parisian &quot;chanson&quot; ===
Beginning in the late 1520s through mid-century, Claudin de Sermisy, Pierre Certon, Clément Janequin, and Philippe Verdelot were composers of so-called Parisian &quot;chansons&quot;, which also abandoned the &quot;formes fixes&quot;, often featured four voices, and were in a simpler, more homophonic style. This genre sometimes featured music that was meant to be evocative of certain imagery such as birds or the marketplace. Many of these Parisian works were published by Pierre Attaingnant. Composers of their generation, as well as later composers, such as Orlando de Lassus, were influenced by the Italian madrigal.

==Modern &quot;chanson&quot;==
French solo song developed in the late 16th century, probably from the aforementioned Parisian works. During the 17th century, the &quot;air de cour&quot;, &quot;chanson pour boire&quot; and other like genres, generally accompanied by lute or keyboard, flourished, with contributions by such composers as Antoine Boesset, Denis Gaultier, Michel Lambert and Michel-Richard de Lalande. This still affects today&#x27;s chanson as many French musicians still employ harp and keyboard.

During the 18th century, vocal music in France was dominated by opera, but solo song underwent a renaissance in the 19th century, first with salon melodies and then by mid-century with highly sophisticated works influenced by the German Lieder, which had been introduced into the country. Louis Niedermeyer, under the particular spell of Schubert, was a pivotal figure in this movement, followed by Édouard Lalo, Felicien David and many others.

Another offshoot of &quot;chanson&quot;, called &quot;chanson réaliste&quot; (realist song), was a popular musical genre in France, primarily from the 1880s until the end of World War II. Born of the &quot;cafés-concerts&quot; and cabarets of the Montmartre district of Paris and influenced by literary realism and the naturalist movements in literature and theatre, &quot;chanson réaliste&quot; was a musical style which was mainly performed by women and dealt with the lives of Paris&#x27;s poor and working class. Among the better-known performers of the genre are Damia, Fréhel, and Édith Piaf.

Later 19th-century composers of French art songs, known as mélodie and not chanson, included Ernest Chausson, Emmanuel Chabrier, Gabriel Fauré, and Claude Debussy, while many 20th-century and current French composers have continued this strong tradition.

=== Revival ===
In the 20th century, French composers revived the genre. Claude Debussy composed Trois Chansons for choir a capella, completed in 1908. Maurice Ravel wrote &quot;Trois Chansons&quot; for choir a cappella after the outbreak of World War I as a return to French tradition, published in 1916.

=== &quot;Nouvelle chanson&quot; ===

In France today &quot;chanson&quot; or &quot;chanson française&quot; is distinguished from the rest of French &quot;pop&quot; music by following the rhythms of French language, rather than those of English, and a higher standard for lyrics.

=== Museum ===
In La Planche, Loire-Atlantique, the Musée de la chanson française was established in 1992. The museum has the goal to remember the artists that have established the heritage of the &quot;chanson&quot;.

<text>The Billy DeFrank LGBTQ+ Community Center (formerly the Billy DeFrank Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center) is a non-profit organization that promotes services for and about the LGBT community of San Jose and Santa Clara County, California. The mission statement of the DeFrank Center is to provide &quot;community, leadership, advocacy, services and support to the Silicon Valley’s LGBTQ+ People and their Allies.&quot;

==Name==
The Billy DeFrank LGBTQ+ Community Center is named after Billy DeFrank, the stage name of William Price (1936–1980), an African-American and prominent 1970s gay rights activist and a member of the Bay Area&#x27;s drag community. In 2021, to commemorate the DeFrank Center&#x27;s 40th anniversary, artist Serge Gay Jr. painted a mural on the side of the DeFrank Center that features a portrait of DeFrank.
==History==
The Billy DeFrank Lesbian and Gay Community Center opened on March 1, 1981, in a two-room storefront on Keyes St. in south downtown San Jose, a year after Santa Clara County residents voted to repeal ordinances extending housing and employment protections to lesbians and gay men. The new DeFrank Center emerged from a desire to respond to that setback.

The DeFrank Center was the meeting place for several activist groups, include High Tech Gays, which brought the &quot;High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office&quot; suit in 1984 arguing that the U.S. Department of Defense should not deny security clearances to applicants who were known or thought to be homosexual. 
The DeFrank Center was also one of the original meeting places of Bay Area Municipal Elections Committee (BAYMEC), a PAC that advocates for the civil rights of LGBTQ people.
In subsequent years, the DeFrank Center expanded to serve a large and diverse community. It moved location several times within San Jose before landing at its current location on The Alameda in San Jose&#x27;s gay-friendly St Leo neighborhood. In 2016, the street in front of the center became the site of San Jose&#x27;s first rainbow-striped crosswalk.

To commemorate World AIDS Day on December 1, 2023, the DeFrank Center displayed several panels of the AIDS Memorial Quilt.

==Services==
From all around the nine counties of the Bay Area, the DeFrank Center provides resources to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people of all ages and backgrounds. Each month more than a thousand people visit the DeFrank Center. Their online newsletter has over 6,000 subscribers. The DeFrank Center has events, activities, and support groups every week. They also provide HIV testing, a cyber center, a library, and art exhibits.

<doc id="408598" wikidata="Q408181" url="?curid=408598" title="Tláhuac">
<text>Tláhuac is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in the Mexico City, located in the southeastern edge of the entity. Though Tláhuac still contains rural communities within its borders, mostly in the southern and eastern portions, the borough has undergone a massive shift from urbanization, especially in its northwest. Tláhuac has experienced the fastest rate of population growth in Mexico City since the 1960s.

Much of the area is former lakebed where Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco met, with the town of San Pedro Tláhuac originally on an island. There are still some lake areas along with four major canals and wetlands, also under conservation status. The urbanization has led to serious traffic and transportation problems as well as the completion of Line 12 of the Mexico City Metro in 2012, which a terminal in the borough.
==Geography==


The borough of Tláhuac is located in the southeastern part of the Mexico City, about 60 km from the historic center of Mexico City . It is bordered by the boroughs of Iztapalapa, Milpa Alta and Xochimilco as well as the municipality of Valle de Chalco Solidaridad in the State of Mexico . The borough extends over 89.5.km2 of territory, accounting for 5.75% of the Mexico City. The borough is part of the Valley of Mexico, in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that extends across central Mexico. The borough expands over much of the former Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco where the two connected, which were drained over the centuries since the Spanish conquest. The territory is classified into three zones, flat lakebed, transitional areas and hills with accumulated volcanic materials. The main elevations include the Guadalupe Volcano, the Xaltepec Volcano, Tecuautzi, Tetecón, the Sierra de Santa Catarina and Teuhtli Volcano. The Sierra de Santa Catarina is a small volcanic belt which has elevations of up to 2,800 meters above sea level. It serves as an important aquifer recharge area as well as a barrier to urban sprawl from Iztapalapa on the other side. On the south end is the Tehuitli Volcano with an altitude of 2,700 meters above sea level.

The borough contains a number of towns and localities. Those considered by the government to be urban (with 2010 population figures in parentheses) are: Tláhuac (305,076), San Juan Ixtayopan (24,120), San Andrés Mixquic (13,310), Santa Catarina Yecahuitzotl (9,563), and San Nicolás Tetelco (4,246). In addition, there are approximately 50 rural settlements with populations each of less than 1,000.

The predominant climate of the borough is semi moist and temperate with an average annual temperature of 15.7C varying between a low of 8.3C and a high of 22.8C. The average annual rainfall is 533.8mm with most rain falling from June to August.

Much of the area is former shallow lake with remaining open water, wetlands and canals. Much of the surface water is saline due to the high mineral content of the soil and lack of natural outflow. The Lago de los Reyes Aztecas (Lake of the Aztec Kings) is a lake that covers 1.9 hectares and connects to the large network of canals and chinampas of the borough. It hosts about twenty five species of migratory birds including ducks and storks along with various fish, amphibians and reptiles. It is the most important tourist attraction of the borough with docks and trajinera boats. The main docks in Tlahuac do not have a large number of boats or restaurants as in Xochimilco. It is still possible to see small natural islands as well as natural vegetation in much of the area with chinampas still growing foodstuffs such as broccoli, chard, beets, chili peppers, peas, fava beans and corn. There are four main canals: Chalco, Guadalupano, Atecuyuac and Amecameca. The first two are important as sources of water for the chinampas of the borough and as a tourist attraction. There are also other smaller canals which serve as irrigation. On the border with the State of Mexico, there is an important ecological reserve lake area called the Cieniega de Tláhuac. There is also an artificial lake at the Bosque de Tláhuac. Los Humedales wetlands is an ecological reserve which covers between 400 and 800 hectares depending on whether it is the rainy or dry season, a remnant of Lake Chalco. It is one of the few wetlands left in the Valley of Mexico and host a large number of migratory birds. It is also home to species called pocket gophers, skunks, squirrels, snakes and bats.

Much of the borough is an important recharge zone for aquifers especially the area around the Sierra de Santa Catarina. There are a number of flooding areas, especially during the rainy season, mostly due to poor drainage systems and the existence of urban areas on former lakebed. Despite having a significant amount former lakebed the borough in general is not prone to earthquake damage, with only a few areas with susceptibility scattered in the borough. There is also a fault line south of Avenida Tláhuac.

Most of the wild vegetation of the area is that of grassland with very little forest mostly due to a long history of agriculture in the area. One of the few forested areas is the Ayaquemetl mountain is near San Nicolás Tetelco with about ten hectares. There have been some efforts at reforestation. However, most of the plant life is the growing of crops, especially in the east and south growing corn, spinach, other leafy greens, alfalfa, figs, pears, and walnuts. There is also significant aquatic vegetation such as water lilies, chichicastle and ninfa. Most of the wildlife of the area has been extinguished because of human encroachment but in the Santa Catarina mountains there are still badgers, cacomistle and bats as well as various kinds of rodents and birds found throughout the borough.

The main problems confronting the borough, like others in the south of the Mexico City, are urban sprawl and environmental concerns. The area is under transition from rural to urban as it borders the urbanized Iztapalapa and the rural Milpa Alta. Its population is growing as people move away from the more crowded city center. 33.5% of the territory is urbanized and 66.5% is classified as environmentally protected. Most of the latter land (4,030 hectares out of 5,674) is farmed. Most of the rest of the land corresponds to surface water such as the Ciénega de Tláhuac and the foothills of the Teuhtli mountains west of San Juan Ixtayopan. Just under 75% of the urbanized space is residential, with 12.1% as mixed use, 5.8% is parks and green spaces, 5.5% is occupied by irregular settlements and 1.7% is dedicated to urban infrastructure. The areas undergoing the most urbanization are La Nopalera. Agrícola Metropolitana, Villa Centroamericana, Santiago Norte and La Asunción, mostly due to the construction of apartment buildings. Sprawl comes into the borough mostly from Iztapalapa, through Avenida Tláhuac and the San Rafael Atlixco rail line. It also comes in from Coyoacan and Xochimilco through the Canal de Chalco and Anillo Periférico, as well as from Valle de Solidaridad Chalco in the State of Mexico. The best preserved areas are those that border rural Milpa Alta. The main urban corridors are along Avenida Tláhuac which is also where most of the commercial activity takes place. Other corridors include Avenida Estanislao Ramírez, Avenida La Turba and Avenida Jiménez. Most of the mixed use space is in the northwest of the borough and along Avenida Tláhuac. Urbanization is most prominent in the northwest of the borough, which has most of the area&#x27;s apartment complexes. The rest of the borough has single family homes and duplexes. Other areas with significant residential growth are Zapotitlán and San Francisco Tlaltenco which has led to a deterioration of their traditional rural appearance. This is especially true in locations closest to Avenida Tlahuac. Areas which have maintained more of their rural character are Santa Catarina Yechuizotl (sheltered by Sierra de Santa Catarina), as well as SanJuan Ixtayopan, San Nicolas Tetelco and San Andrés Mixquic, which are mostly surrounded by chinampas and other farmland that is under protection.

Other green spaces in the borough include parks, sporting and recreational areas. The Bosque de Tláhuac is a recreational area with a number of attractions, which was opened in 2007, converted from a former landfill. It extends over 72 hectares and features an artificial lake, a teaching farm/greenhouse, a cactus garden, volleyball and basketball courts, soccer fields, track, bicycle paths and an area for cultural events. It also includes an area called the “Mini-Marquesa” with attractions such as ATV tracks similar to those found at the La Marquesa National Park, as well as the city&#x27;s first artificial beach (pools plus sand area) designed for children. Parque de los Olivos (Olive Tree park) dates back to the colonial period when in 1531 olive trees were planted here by missionaries and were some of the few that escaped destruction by royal decree to protect Spanish olive production. It also contains a small hill where archeological artifacts from as far back as 400 BCE have been found. Parque Xalli (Xalli Park) is located on the old road to San Francisco Tlatenco. It was founded by Alejandro Reyes and Valentín Hernández with 3,000 square meters of installations related to ecology. It has a 60 meter long zip line and a climbing wall. It has a large sand area for children, as well as a trampoline, pool, tree house and mini zip lines. There is also a petting zoo with various farm animals, most of which were donated to the park. Other green spaces include athletic and recreational centers in Santa Catarina, Colonia del Mar, Miguel Hidalgo, Zapotitlán, San Francisco Tlaltenco, San Pedro Tláhuac, San Juan Ixtayopan, San Nicolás Tetelco and San Andrés Mixquic.

Pollution problems in the borough stem from the urbanization of the area. Traffic congestion is a serious problem and parking space is severely lacking. Much of the pollution in the borough comes from fixed sources along Avenida Tláhuac. Canal and lake waters have moderate problems with pollution in the way of garbage and the infestation of non-native water lily plants. The borough generates 356 tons of trash per day, 3.12% of what is produced in the Mexico City. There are thirty areas where there is illegal house building, mostly near the Sierra de Santa Catarina and around San Juan Ixtayopan and La Conchita.

==Seven Native Towns==

The most important communities in the borough are called the Seven Original/Native Towns of Tláhuac (Siete Pueblos Originarios de Tláhuac), meaning that they were established before the arrival of the Spanish. These are Santiago Zapotitlán, San Francisco Tlaltenco, Santa Catarina Yechuizotl, San Nicolas Tetelco, San Juan Ixtayopan, San Andrés Mixquic and San Pedro Tláhuac.

San Pedro Tláhuac is the oldest of these, founded in the 13th century. From that time until well into the colonial period, it was an island in the waters between Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco, and was the capital of a dominion that stretched of much of what is now the borough of Tláhuac. After the Spanish conquest, the ceremonial center was destroyed on top was built a church and monastery dedicated to Saint Peter, dated to 1529. At the time, it was one of the most important churches in the southern Valley of Mexico. It was rebuilt several times due to moisture damage with the current structure dating to the 17th century. The San Pedro church as three naves with images of Saint Peter, Saint Joachim and the Holy Trinity inside. In the tower there is a clock dating to 1924, which was donated by the Ejido of Tláhuac. Around the town, there is an areas with chinampas and a small residual lake called the Lago de los Reyes Aztecas, which also hosts the “Museo Vivo” (Live Museum) about the canals and farming of the area. Its main festivity is the Regional Fair of Tláhuac, held at the end of June along with honors to the town&#x27;s patron saint.

San Andrés Mixquic in the Mesoamerican period was also a dominion located on a small lake island. Its main landmark is its parish church, founded in 1537. This church was built on top of a sanctuary for the goddess of life and death with archeological excavations finding many artifacts including a Chac Mool and two rings for a Mesoamerican ball court. The original building was mostly destroyed in an earthquake and then rebuilt in 1600. The only remains from the first church is the bell tower, which is separate from the church building. In each of the town&#x27;s named neighborhoods, there is a stone cross, which is the center of celebrations on May 3. The patron saint is honored on November 30, with processions. San Andrés Mixquis is known for its Day of the Dead celebrations which attract many visitors each year.

San Francisco Tlaltenco is one of the largest communities in the borough, located in the north of the borough on the south side of the Sierra de Santa Catarina. It main church is the San Francisco de Asís founded in 1547. Another important landmark is the Gate or Arch of Tlaltenco, which dates to the colonial period. It served as a customs checkpoint until just after the Mexican War of Independence. It is considered to be symbolic of the area. During the Mexican Revolution, it was occupied by the Zapatistas and those loyal to Venustiano Carranza as a campsite. Its patron saint, Francis of Assisi, is honored for eight days starting on October 4 with processions and sawdust carpets. Another major celebration is Carnival which is celebrated with Chinelos. On the fifth Sunday after Ash Wednesday, a Christ figure called the Señor de Mazatepec is honored.

Santiago Zapotitlán was founded in 1435. After the Aztecs conquered the area, they rearranged the layout of this town. After the Spanish conquest, the Inmaculada Concepción church was established in 1541 and rebuilt in 1939. Its founding is celebrated on December 8 of each year. Santiago Zapotitlán is noted for its religious and cultural traditions with both pre Hispanic and Spanish roots. One of its main celebrations is the La Fiesta de Luces y Música (Festival of Lights and Music) which is based on the New Fire ceremony. Today it is celebrated with traditional dances and fireworks along with music played on both indigenous and European instruments.

San Juan Ixtayopan is in the south of the borough made up of five named neighborhoods called San Augustin, La Concepción, La Soledad, La Asunción and La Lupita. Just outside there are six others called Francisco Villa, El Rosario, Tierra Blanca, Peña Alta and Jardines del Llano. Its main church is La Soledad constructed in the 19th century. Although it has been severely affected urban sprawl, there is still some chinampa farming surrounding it. The town was the site of the Battles of Ixtayopan during the Mexican Revolution. Zapatistas under Everardo González took over the area from federal troops with the support of the local people. Later these forces battled those loyal to Venustiano Carranza in the power struggles that ensued among the rebel factions. San Juan Ixtayopan has a site museum located in Los Olivos Park which houses a number of archeological finds with 188 exhibited. The main plaza is the Plaza de la Soledad, built in the 17th century. The main festivals are for Our Lady of Solitude from 2–5 January and for John the Baptist from 22 – 24 June. The town is noted for a hot beverage called calientito” (little hot one) which is a mix of sugar cane alcohol, orange juice, guava, raisins and sugar cane. In August, San Juan Ixtayopan hosts an annual Corn Fair to promote products made with the grain as well as the local culture.

San Nicolás Tetelco is centered on its parish church dedicated to Nicholas of Tolentino, constructed in the 17th century. In the presbytery, there is a large crucifix which is probably made from corn stalk in the colonial era as well as a holy water font from the 16th century. Other landmarks include the Plaza Emiliano Zapata, which is surrounded by older constructions, the Monument to Christ the King, the Ahuapa sports facility, the Ayaquemetl ecological area and the chinampa zones. It is also home to the former hacienda Santa Fe, which was founded in the 17th century which operated until the Mexican Revolution. Remains of its chapel, main house and workers’ living quarters still remain. The town is noted for its atole, cooked traditionally over a wood fire.

Santa Catarina Yecahuitzotl is located in the northeast of the borough. Its church, dedicated to Saint Catherine, dates to 1647, constructed of tezontle. The atrium has four small chapels located in the four corners. Until the 1960s, the community was isolated from Mexico City. However at that time urban sprawl began to reach it changing much of the community&#x27;s way of life. Its original name was Acatzinco, then Santa Catarina Cuautli-Itlacuayan. Its current name has been interpreted to mean “the third part of the south road,” the “nose of an amphibian” and “land of ants.” The name change came with the town&#x27;s refounding in 1924 when ejido members organized their lands among themselves. Other important locations include La Troje, site of Mexican Revolution activity, the charrería ring, the former Xico hacienda and two environmental education centers. It is divided into a number of neighborhoods called colonias such as Maria Isabel, Santiago, Del Carmen, San Juan Tlalpizahuac, Ampliación San Juan TlalpizahuacSan Francisco Apolocalco, La Cañada, Campestre Potrero, San Francisco Tlaltenco, Selene and Ampliacion Selene.

==History==

The name “Tláhuac” comes from Nahuatl, mostly likely a derivation of “Cuitláhuac”. However, its meaning is in dispute, with interpretations including “the place where cuítatl (a type of algae) is gathered”, “place where the Lord sings”, “guardian or steward of the land&quot;, “born among the rocks of the lakes” and “place of he who cares for the water”.

The Tláhuac was established on a small island in the waters between Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco in 1222 by the Chichimecas. By the 14th century, it had become a dominion expanding as far as what is now Santiago Zapotitlán and Santa Catarina Yecahuizotl, but distinct from the dominion of Mixquic, which was on a nearby island. Tláhuac was connected to the mainland by two causeways leading to Santiago Zapotitlán and Tulyehualco. The first regional leader of the area was Cohuatomatzin in 1262. The dominion remained independent until the 14th century, when it was conquered by the Tepanecs. Soon after, it was dominated by the Aztecs. During the pre-Hispanic period, the economy of the area was based on chinampa farming and fishing. After conquest, the area paid tribute to Azcapotzalco and then to Tenochtitlan. The town of Tláhuac was laid out along the various dikes and canals which centered on a ceremonial center, where the San Pedro parish church is today.

The area was prone to flooding but it was prosperous due to intensive chinampa farming, growing corn, beans, chili peppers, tomatoes, squash, flowers and more. Much of this produce was sent to Mexico City as a way of paying tribute. There was a major flood in 1499, prompting the construction of a large dike against the lake waters. Another dike was constructed to separate the lakes.

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, colonial authorities defined Tláhuac as extending to Zapotitlán, Cuauhtlitl-Tlacuayan (Santa Catarina) and Tulyehualco. In the colonial period, the Spanish authorities initially emphasized Mixquic as a political center because it has only one indigenous chief, while Tláhuac was divided under four. Three orders began evangelical work, the Augustinians in Mixquic and the Franciscans, replaced by the Dominicans in Tláhuac. By the 18th century, Tláhuac had come under the administration of Chalco. The area&#x27;s economy remain tied to agriculture, still sending much of the production to Mexico City, now to be sold. Flood control projects continued, with drainage of lake area begun in 1555. During the colonial period and into the 19th century, transportation by small boats was primary on the area&#x27;s lakes and canals. Boats transported not only people but cargo, especially agricultural produce bound for Mexico City. Customs gates were installed on the main canals in Tlatenco and Tulyehualco to collect taxes on various vegetables, cereals and alcohol from the state of Morelos. Important colonial era haciendas included San Nicolas Tolentino, Santa Fe Tetelco and Zoquiapan.

After the Mexican War of Independence, Tláhuac became part of the State of Mexico. When the Federal District of Mexico City was expanded in 1854, Tláhuac became part of the District, then part of the prefecture of Xochimilco in 1857. Agriculture remained the main economic activity. In the late 19th century, the Santa Fe hacienda was known for its cattle and the size of the vegetables grown there. In 1856, the Mexico City-Tlahuac causeway flooded completely. In 1895, a project was started to drain Lake Chalco. Soon after, the Chalco-Tlaltenco road was constructed over the former lake bed, followed by a rail line that passed through half of the current territory of the borough. In the latter 19th century, steamships traveling between Mexico City and Chalco passed by.

In the 19th century, the town of Tláhuac had municipality status which was eliminated in 1903 with a reorganization of the Federal District. The Mexican Revolution soon followed with one major battle at San Juan Ixtayopan between forces loyal to Emiliano Zapata and Venustiano Carranza. After the end of the military conflict, residents petitioned for autonomy, leading to the segregation of Tláhuac from Xochimilco in 1924 as a municipality. In 1928, this revived municipality was reorganized again into the current borough. The borders of the borough were not finalized until 1994, over opposition from Ejido members in some communities along the border with the State of Mexico.

The urban sprawl of Mexico City began to take over the Ejido lands in the mid-20th century, with former farmlands converted into housing subdivisions, especially in the areas closest to Iztapalapa.

In November 2004, three policemen were surrounded by an angry mob and lynched in San Juan Ixtayopan. They were accused of being kidnappers after taking pictures of children. Two of the policemen were burned alive while one rescued hours after the incident began.

==Culture==

The area considers itself traditional conserving many colonial and Mesoamerican era traditions. Culturally the most important communities are the seven which have pre Hispanic roots which were located on the banks of Lakes Chalco and Xochimilco. Today these communities area marked by the oldest churches in the borough. Other important heritage sites as demarcated by INAH and the borough include the chinampas, located in various parts of the borough and Parque de los Olivos.

One important tradition is Day of the Dead, celebrated throughout the borough but San Andrés Mixquic&#x27;s is particularly well known, attracting thousands of visitors from Mexico and abroad. The celebration generally lasts three days from October 31 to November 1 each day focusing on different groups, children, adults and saints. One local tradition related to the day is to hang a paper lantern often in the form of a star at the entrance to home as a way to greet the return of the souls of the dead. The Fiestas del Santo Jubileo is a custom observed on different days in the communities of the borough. It consists of a mass and exhibition of the Host on the main altar of the church for 40 hours, surrounded by flowers, sawdust carpets, live music, dances and fireworks. Carnival is important in San Francisco Tlaltenco and Santiago Zapotitlán, where dancers generally are chinelos and those in charro suits. These carnivals begin on the fourth Sunday of Lent. The tradition in San Francisco Tlaltenco goes back to the end of the 19th century. A reenactment of Palm Sunday has been held each year at San Pedro Tláhuac for over eighty years, with the procession winding its way through eight different neighborhoods. San Pedro Tláhuac is also the site of the Regional Fair of Tláhuac. It was first organized in 1956, with the goal so attracting tourism and encouraging youth to maintain traditions. It begins with a procession of the image of the patron saint, the Apostle Peter, in decorated trajinera boats in the chinampa areas of Lago de los Reyes Aztecas. Other events include the selection of a fair queen, conferences, cultural events, concerts, dances, fireworks and more, with proceeds going to the restoration of the San Pedro Apostal Church.
The Baile del Guajolote (Dance of the Turkey) is a traditional dance in the towns of Santiago Zapotitlán and San Pedro Tláhuac, which is performed at weddings, baptism, first communions and quinceañeras. It includes the gifting of a live turkey along with a large food basket from one family to another. Another important traditional dance, especially in Santiago Zapotitlan is the Dance of Moors and Christians also called the Danza de los Santiagueros (Dance of those of Saint James). The dance represents the battles between the Moors and Christians in which Saint James plays a central role.

Typical foods are mostly similar to those found in the rest of Mexico City. One local dish is michmole, made from fish and sauce with herbs such as epazote . 

Overall, there is a significant lack of cultural institutions such as theaters, auditoriums and museums. However a number of institutions do exist. The Tlahuac Regional Museum is located in San Pedro Tláhuac. It is housed in the former civil registry office and was the first museum established in the borough. The Regional Museum of Mixquic is on the side of the parish church. It contains exhibitions of local archeological pieces which mostly date between 1200 and 1500CE but also some from the Toltec and Teotihuacan periods. The church and former monastery are also classed as an archeological site. The Andrés Quintana Roo Museum has a collection of 279 archeological pieces from the collectionof Dr. Socorro Bernal Roque. The pieces are mostly of clay and stone from the Teotihuacan era found in the Tlahuac area. The most important pieces are a chac-mool, the remains of a teotlachtli, clay and stone seals, a tzompantli and a cylindrical serpent. The Tomás Medina Villarruel Museum is named after a native of San Juan Ixtayopan who is an important figure in the conservation of the archeological record of the area. In 1984, he and his family donated a collection of 850 pieces to the borough. The museum was built in 1998 as a community museum and the collection has since grown with new donations. The Fábrica de Artes y Oficios FARO Tláhuac was founded in 2006, as part of a network of FAROs sponsored by the city Secretary of Culture. Its aim is to promote community involvement in the arts and various trades. It has workshops on various to allow residents to learn creative and practical skills as well as conferences, cinema, theater, art exhibitions, concerts and more. Other cultural institutions in the borough include the Centro Cultural Zapotitlán, Centro Cultural Santa Catarina, Centro Cultural Nopalera, Casa de Cultura Diego Rivera, Casa de Cultura Frida Kahlo, Casa de Cultura Ampliación Los Olivos and the Casa de Cultura Rosario Castellanos.

==Socioeconomics==

From the second half of the 20th century, the population and number of housing units has risen rapidly. The population has grown from 29,880 inhabitants in 1960, to 146,293 in 1980, to 255,891 in 1995 to 361,014 as of the 2010 census. In the 1960s and 1970s, the rate of growth was over 7%. It has since slowed to under 4.5%, but it is still the highest in the Federal District. The main draw is the relatively low cost of land in comparison to the rest of the city. Tláhuac has a population density of 90 inhabitants per hectare, one of the lowest in the Federal District, which has an average of 128 per hectare. However, in some areas, density has climbed to over 200 per hectare mostly in the northwest. However, most of the borough still has fewer than 100 per hectare. Neighborhoods with the densest population include La Nopalera, Colonial Miguel Hidalgo and Colonial Los Olivos where most of the borough&#x27;s apartment complexes can be found. Just under eighty percent of housing units are owned by their occupants, but still about ninety percent of housing units are single family homes.

Between 60,000 and 70,000 families inhabit 93 irregular settlements in Tlahuac. While some of the irregular settlements are in conservation areas, most are in areas in which the topography does not allow for the provision of urban services such as water. Although basic services extend to over 80-90 percent of the population, communities in the periphery and those which are new and not yet consolidated tend to suffer a lack of basic services along with transportation and roads.

Just under seventy percent of the population is under age thirty but this percentage has been slowing shrinking as the borough ages.

The Consejo Nacional de Población ranks Tláhuac as having a very low level of socioeconomic marginalization. About seventy percent of the population is employed in commerce and services. Twenty eight percent is involved in manufacturing and about 3.5% work in agriculture, the highest percentage in the Federal District. Over ninety percent of the commerce in the delegation occurs in small businesses, mostly along Avenida Tláhuac, Avenida La Turba and in the centers of the towns. Informal commerce, especially tianguis markets, is found in Zapotitlpan, San Pedro Tláhuac, near the San Lorenzo Tezonco cemetery and some along Avenida Tláhuac. There are 712 manufacturing concerns generally small concerns located in the northwest of the borough, producing food products, drinks, tobacco products, metal products, machinery and equipment. The service sector is mostly related to repair and maintenance. Most agriculture is found in the south and east with just over 4,000 hectares are under cultivation in the borough growing corn, animal feed, spinach, alfalfa and figs. Most of the livestock raised is pigs, followed by cattle than sheep.

The borough has two groups of police and five monitoring stations. However, the urbanization of the area has brought in increased crime including gang activity.

==Education==
The borough has sixty seven preschools, seventy nine primary schools, twenty three middle schools and four high schools. There are sufficient primary and middle schools but a lack of educational services above this level. There are public libraries in Santiago Zapotitlán, San Pedro Tláhuac, Colonial del Mar, Miguel Hidalgo and Tetelco. The Universidad Insurgentes has several installations in the borough. The borough has a 5.61% illiteracy rate which compares favorably to the rest of Mexico City, but drop out rates are a concern. Most students drop out at the high school level or above, completing primary and middle school. But even at the primary level the dropout rate is 22.8%. The primary reason is the financial situation of the family.

Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
* Escuela Preparatoria Tláhuac &quot;José Ma. Morelos y Pavón&quot;

==Transportation==

Transportation for the borough connects the area with neighboring boroughs and the State of Mexico. The Most important road is Avenida Tláhuac, which crosses almost the entire territory, followed by Anillo Periférico and the Mexico City-Tulyehualco road. Road traffic is heavy and congested during many hours of the day, including weekends. Some of the worst traffic in the borough is in Santiago Tulyehualco, where various major roads such as Aquiles Serdan, Francisco Presa, the Tlahuac-Tulyehualco road and Isidro Tapia all converge.
There are both public and private bus lines, mostly working out of four official bus stations. There is also one taxi station but there are also a large number of informal bicycle taxis, motorcycle taxis and taxis converted from golf carts because of the lack of organized public transportation in a number of areas.

A major change in public transportation is the completion of Line 12 of the Mexico City Metro, which a terminal in Tláhuac. The construction of the line into the borough was controversial. One argument was that it would worsen the already bad traffic congestion by encouraging more urban sprawl. Ejido members protested the appropriation of the Ejido of San Francisco Tlaltenco in order to build the terminal. The establishment of the terminal Tláhuac caused a struggle between bus operators in the Federal District and neighboring State of Mexico for rights to transport passengers between the station and points in the State of Mexico, especially the suburb of Chalco. Residents complained that construction of the line left Avenida Tláhuac in poor condition for local traffic and pedestrians.

<text>Milpa Alta is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. It lies in the southeast corner of the nation&#x27;s capital, bordering the State of Mexico and Morelos. It is the least populated, second largest and most rural of all the boroughs. It is also one of the most traditional areas of the city, with over 700 religious and secular festivals during the year and an economy based on agriculture and food processing, especially the production of nopal cactus, barbacoa and mole sauce.

==Geography==
The borough of Milpa Alta is located in the southeast of Mexico City bordering the boroughs of Xochimilco, Tláhuac and Tlalpan, with the state of Morelos to the south and the State of Mexico to the west. It has the second largest territorial extension after Tlalpan, occupying 268.6km2.

The terrain is rugged mostly consisting of volcanic peak along with some small flat areas mostly formed in the Cenozoic Era. City officials have classified the entire borough as a conservation zone, important for its role as an aquifer recharge area as well as its forests. Forest, farmland and grazing areas constitute 98.1% of the total surface area.

It has an average altitude of 2,420 meters above sea level with altitudes varying between 2,300 and 3,600. It is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Chichinautzin volcanic mountain chain, which separates Mexico City from the state of Morelos. The borough is divided into three zones: Ajusco-Teuhtli, the lowest elevations, Topilejo-Milpa Alta in the medium range and Cerro-Tlicuaya at the highest elevations. The main elevations are volcanic and include Cuautzin (3,510), Tulmiac, Ocusacayo (3,220), La Comalera (3,230), San Bartolo (3,200), Tláloc (3,510), Chichinautzin (3,470), Yecahuazac, Quimixtepec, El Oclayuca (3,140), El Pajonal (3,100), El Ocotécatl (3,480), Acopiaxco (3,320), Tetzacoatl (3,310), Tehutli (2,800) Cilcuayo (3,580), Nepanapa (3,460), Texalo (3,560), Oclayuca (3,390), San Miguel (2,988) .

The area belongs to the Amacuzac River basin but only small streams run on the surface. It has ample surface water but confined to small springs and streams which over time have formed a succession of narrow valleys or micro-basins, which are important for recharging the Valley of Mexico’s aquifers. These micro-basins include Cilcuayo, Río Milpa Alta and Cocpiaxco and contain the borough’s main towns.

Most of the area has a temperate climate, with cold climates found at the highest elevations. The average annual temperature is with average lows at and averages highs at . Average annual precipitation is . Freezing temperatures occur occasionally from October to March especially in the higher elevations. The windiest months are February and March. On the Koppen scale, its climate is described as C (W2) (w) b (i’) which signified a relatively moist climate, with a rainy season in the summer especially in July and August. However, the climate varies substantially in the territory based mostly on altitude, with six sub-climates: C(E)(w2) which is relatively cold, C(E)(m) also relatively cold but wetter, C(w1) a temperate climate, C (w2) a températe and relatively wet climate, C ( w1) temperate and relatively dry and C ( w2) which is relatively cold with rains falling mostly in the highest areas.

The area has a number of species found nowhere else. The natural vegetation is mostly forest with a mix of pine, oyamel fir and holm oak, with some concentrations of &quot;Abies religiosa&quot;. The most intact forest is found in the small canyons of the Nepanapa volcano and the west side of the Tláloc volcano. Other vegetation include fruit trees such as tejocote (&quot;Crataegus pubescens&quot;), capulin (&quot;Prunus serotona&quot; ssp &quot;capulli&quot;) blackberry (&quot;Rubus adenotrichus&quot;) and well as various scrubs, grass and flowers. The rugged terrain presents a number of micro climates which favor certain species. Depending on conditions oak, cedar, strawberry trees (&quot;Arbutus&quot;), pirul (&quot;Schinus molle&quot;), tepozan (&quot;Buddleja cordata&quot;), nopal cactus and maguey can be found. Wildlife includes 59 species of mammals such as zacatuche rabbits (&quot;Romerolagus diazi&quot;), which in danger of extinction, along with coyotes, deer, lynx and moles. However, only sixteen of these species are still commonly seen because of habitat destruction. Species such as wild boar, bobcats and opossums are extinct in the area. There are about 200 bird species native to the area in 128 classes, 33 families and eleven orders. Eighty percent of the species live in the area year round. There are twenty four amphibian species from ten classes, seven families and two orders and fifty six species of reptiles from thirty one classes, ten families and two orders. A notable areas for these two classes of animal is the corridor between the Ajusco and Chichinautzin mountains.

While named after Villa Milpa Alta, the borough is not concentrated on a single community like Tlahuac or Xochimilco but rather is composed of twelve main towns all of which are rural. This limits the area’s connectivity with the urban zone of Mexico City. Main communities in the borough include San Pedro Atocpan, Villa Milpa Alta (formerly called Malacachtepec), San Bartolome Xicomulco, San Francisco Tecoxpa, Santa Ana Tlacotenco, San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan, San Juan Tepanahuac, San Agustin Ohtenco, San Antonio Tecómitl, San Pablo Oztotepec and San Jerónimo Miacantla. San Agustin Ohtenco is considered to be the smallest community in Mexico City. These main towns are subdivided into twenty nine neighborhoods called barrios and there are 225 communities in the borough total. Villa Milpa Alta has seven barrios, San Mateo (the largest), La Concepción, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, San Agustin, Santa Martha and La Luz.

==Demographics and culture==

With a population of 130,592 , Milpa Alta has the lowest population of Mexico City’s sixteen boroughs. About half of the borough’s residents live in or near Villa Milpa Alta and about eighty percent are under forty. It is also one of the city’s most rural and traditional areas. There is a dual system of government, administrative and agricultural, with the latter mostly tasked with the administration of common lands. The social organization of the area is traditional, based on families headed by a male, nuclear in the towns and extended in the more rural areas. Men still hold most of the paying jobs, with most women classed as homemakers, although many of these work in family business, generally for no salary. While it has the lowest crime rates overall, it does have problems with alcoholism in men leading to domestic violence. The borough is gaining population from migration from places like the State of Mexico, Puebla and Oaxaca. and few people migrate out.

The borough contains a number of towns and localities. Those considered by the government to be urban (with 2010 population figures in parentheses) are: San Antonio Tecómitl (24,397), Villa Milpa Alta (18,274), San Pablo Oztotepec (15,507), San Salvador Cuauhtenco (13,856), San Francisco Tecoxpa (11,456), Santa Ana Tlacotenco (10,593), San Pedro Atocpan (8,283), San Bartolomé Xicomulco (4,340), San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan (3,676), and San Nicolás Tetelco (3,490). In addition, there are approximately 250 rural settlements with populations each of less than 1,000.

Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area was dominated by the Nahuas. Its one of the few places left in the city with Nahuatl speaking communities, with 4,007 people speaking an indigenous language . The use of Nahuatl is widespread in the borough, with the most concentrated in the towns of Santa Ana Tlacotenco, San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan and San Pablo Oztotepec. Ethnic Nahuas are found in all of the borough’s main towns. There are also efforts to preserve and promote the use of the language in the borough.

The Nahuas are primarily Catholic with a number of indigenous beliefs still remaining and blended in. Most of these have to do with the agricultural cycle, often represented by veneration to the saints. Traditional medicine is still practiced by a number of Nahuas in combination with modern medicine. Starting in the 1950s, evangelical movements such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses have made inroads into the area. Traditional housing among the Nahuas is of adobe, but these are being replaced by cement and cinderblock constructions. Traditional handcrafts include embroidered clothing and articles made from maguey fiber (ixtle). The current community struggles to maintain its identity and culture and to prevent being absorbed into the urban sprawl of Mexico City. One way of doing this is through ecotourism on tribal land including guided hikes, zip lines, temazcals and camping. The community also sponsors reforestation events.

The borough lacks theaters, shopping centers, supermarkets and hotels. However, it is one of the boroughs in the city that conserves many of its traditional religious festivals, with about 700 per year, about two per day somewhere in the borough. these fairs and festivals bring 1,200,000 visitors each year to the borough. Each community in the borough, including the twelve main towns and each of these towns’ neighborhoods has a patron saint celebrated once a year. The areas with the most festivals and other events are San Francisco Tecoxpa, San Pedro Atocpan, San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan, San Salvador Cuauhtenco, Santa Ana Tlacotenco, San Pablo Ozotepec, San Agustín Ohtenco, Villa Milpa Alta, San Jerónimo Miacatlán and San Juan Tepanahuac. The most important saint day in the entire borough is that of Our Lady of the Assumption in August. Other important religious events include the passion play, held jointly by the towns of San Francisco Tecoxpa, San Pedro Atocpan, San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan and San Antonio Tecómitl and requires six months of preparations. Carnival is celebrated in San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan, San Antonio Tecómitl, San Pablo Oztotepec and Villa Milpa Alta. Day of the Dead is celebrated in the borough with altars, the cleaning and decorating of gravesites, masses and vigils like many other places in Mexico but it is also celebrated with the release of sky lanterns in communities such as San Agustin Ohtenco, as well as publicly held events such as concerts, the creation of monumental papier-mâché skulls and even Mesoamerican ball games. Holy Week is very important in the borough, especially the Passion Play held each year to reenact the passion and death of Jesus. The event involves over sixty actors, all residents of the borough chosen yearly. The current tradition was started in 1905, although it was suspended during the Mexican Revolution. The scenes of the play are enacted in several locations. Palm Sunday in San Agustin el Alto, the Asunción parish to the main church in Villa Milpa Alta for Good Friday .

Secular events include the Festival of Corn and Pulque in San Antonio Tecomitl in September, Feria de la Nieve (Ice Cream Fair) in San Antonio Tecomitl in March, Feria Ganadera, Gastronómica y Artesanal (Livestock, Gastronomy and Handcraft Fair) in San Pablo Ozotepec in April, the Festival de Juegos Autóctonos celebrating native toys in San Juan Tapanáhuac, the annual fair of San Lorenzo Tlacoyucan in August, and the entire borough celebrates the founding of Villa Milpa Alta on 22 August with a Regional fair and lighting of a New Fire in the crater of the Teutli volcano. In 2012, this event celebrated the town’s 480th anniversary.

The borough is home to four significant balloon events, which together are called the Magic Route of Light. It begins with the Festival Multicultural de Globos de Cantolla (Multicultural Festival of Sky Lanterns) in September in Santa Ana Tlacotenco, with the main event of 3000 lanterns launched at once. It is followed by the Concurso Nacional de Globos y Faroles de Papel de China and the Encuentro Internacional de Constructores de Globos de Papel in San Agustin Ohtenco and San Antonio Tecomitl in November. The last is the Noche de Luces (Night of Lights) in San Francisco Tecoxpa in late November.

==History==
The name Milpa Alta means “high cornfield.” “Alta” means high in Spanish and “milpa” is a Mexican Spanish word from Nahuatl referring to cornfields interspersed with other crops such as squash and maguey. The Nahua name for the area is Momochco Malacateticpac, which means “place of altars surrounded by mountains.” This name is derived from the various volcanoes in the area.

The recorded history of the area begins around 1240 when a Chichimeca group migrated into the Valley of Mexico from the north and founded the Malacachtepec Momozco dominion. They formed settlements in what is now the borough in places such as Malacatepec Momoxco, Ocotenco, Texcalapa, Tototepec, Tepetlacotanco, Huinantongo and Tlaxcomulco. In 1440, Mexica leader Hueyitlahuilli subdued these settlements and installed a leader. The capital of this dominion was centered on the town of Milpa Alta, in what are now the Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, San Mateo and Santa Martha neighborhoods with the name of Malacatepec Momoxco. The area formed a strategic point controlling the road between Tenochtitlan and Oaxtepec and Cuernavaca. At this time several lakeside docks, a ceremonial center, barracks and tribute collections centers were constructed, remnants of which remain.

The indigenous of this area, allied with the Aztecs, struggled against the Spanish for about 100 years before being subdued. This caused many of the indigenous here to abandon their lands and hide in the mountains, making incursions into Spanish held territory to plunder. In 1528, a peace pact was made with these people and the following year, Spanish authorities acknowledge their right to own land and have local governors; however, they were required to pay tribute to the Spanish and convert to Christianity. The Spanish mostly kept their promise to allow indigenous rule except for a brief period in the 17th century. Organizationally, it was considered to be a district of Xochimilco. Compared to the rest of the valley area, it had little contact with the Spanish, allowing it to retain much of its indigenous character.

The Franciscans were in charge of evangelization, naming Our Lady of the Assumption as patron. For evangelization purposes, a modest hermitage dedicated to Saint Martha was constructed with later churches constructed in Tlatatlapocoyan and San Lorenzo. In 1570, the monastery and church of the Assumption was begun, taking a century to construct.

After Independence, the area was initially part of the State of Mexico. The area’s incorporation into the Federal District of Mexico City began in 1854, when the district was expanded by Antonio López de Santa Anna expanded including part of what is now Milpa Alta. However, towns such as San Pedro Atocpan were municipalities in the State of Mexico in the 19th century. In 1903, the Federal District of Mexico City was expanded to include the rest of Milpa Alta.

During the Mexican Revolution, the area generally sympathings with the Liberation Army of the South. In 1914 this army marched to Mexico City from the state of Morelos against the regime of Victoriano Huerta. Part of that march included the occupation of the Milpa Alta area, forming a base. Here Emiliano Zapata ratified the Plan of Ayala on July 19, 1914.

Reorganization of the Federal District of Mexico City created the modern borough, with the government in Villa Milpa Alta in 1929.

While part of the Federal District, most residents still talk about Mexico City as a separate entity. However, it is part of Greater Mexico City. The pace of urbanization in the borough is slower in Milpa Alta than other outlying areas of the Federal District, but the growth of Mexico City since the mid 20th century has been affecting it. Production of corn began to decrease in the mid 20th century. In the 1970s, this process began to hasten. The two major problems associated with this is illegal settlements or squatting on common land and illegal logging. Both of these are most serious in San Salavador Cuauhtenco, where squatters who have been there for years demand regularization and services and enforcers of environmental laws are threatened by residents.

==Socioeconomics==
Milpa Alta is officially classed as one of the poorest in the Federal District by income, with 48.6% considered to be below the poverty line. However it is also considered to have a low level of socioeconomic marginalization. The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the economy is based on cash and not all economic activity is reported. Most of the land is held in common, either in ejidos or other arrangements. There is a problem with the lack of formal titles to land, which has allowed irregular settlements. There is a telegraph office, a post office and various city agencies. Medical attention is mostly provided by two large clinics, one administered by UNAM and the other by ISSSTE and various small ones in various towns. It has little in the way of commerce and services, with no large chain stores, few banks, no movie theaters or little else in the way of entertainment.

The main economic activities of the borough are agriculture and food processing. Most agriculture is still done with traditional methods with only those of greater resources using machinery such as tractors. The most important crop is the nopal cactus, with fields found just about everywhere including spaces between houses in the towns. Founded in 1986, the Feria del Nopal is held in Villa Milpa Alta in June with the aim of promoting the consumption of the paddle cactus. The main event is the culinary exhibition of dishes made with the vegetable along with cultural, social, sporting and artistic events. Other important crops include corn, beans, animal feed, fava beans, peas and honey. Pulque is produced for local consumption.

One important processed food in Milpa Alta is the making of barbacoa, sheep meat cooked in a pit oven lined with maguey leaves. This is made principally for weekend sales for traditional markets and street stands in most of Mexico City. The most important barbacoa producing area is Barrio San Mateo in Villa Milpa Alta. About three thousand sheep are slaughtered and prepared as barbacoa each week in Milpa Alta, but barbacoa is increasingly being made with sheep meat imported from Australia, New Zealand and the United States as it is cheaper than that produced in Mexico. The barbacoa business in the area began in the 1940s and since then has been successful enough to allow many families to send their children to school and become professionals. Despite the younger generation’s higher education, many still participate in the family business. Its success has also allowed barbacoa families to gain a certain amount of prestige in the community.

Even more important is the creation of pastes and powders to make mole sauce. These are created from the grinding and blending of twenty or more ingredients, which always include a variety of chili peppers. The mole sauces made are of various types such as rojo, verde, almendrado and about twenty others with trademarks. The main producer of mole in the borough is San Pedro Atocpan, with almost all its residents involved in its production in some way. Most of this production is done in families or small cooperatives. The restaurants in San Pedro Atocpan also specialize in mole and receive about 8,000 customers each week. The Feria Nacional del Mole occurs each year in San Pedro Atocpan in October and receives thousands of visitors to the festival site as well as the forty restaurants in the town that serve meats in mole sauce.

The only other industry in Milpa Alta is small handcraft workshops making articles such as leather goods, furniture and textiles.

==Education==
Although there are various primary schools, two technical middle schools and two high school (one a vocational school run by the Instituto Politécnico Nacional), Milpa Alta has the highest adult illiteracy rate at 5.6%. Recently a technological institute called the Instituto Technológico de Milpa Alta was opened. Another educational and cultural institution is the Fábrica de Artes y Oficio Milpa Alta. It is the second of its type in the Federal District of Mexico City, patterned after the successful Fábrica de Artes y Oficios Oriente in Iztapalapa. Its function is to provide cultural and entertainment options to residents as well as classes in various arts and trades. In addition it supports the customs and traditions of the twelve indigenous communities found in the borough. It also hosts an annual Pantomime, Clown and Circus Festival sponsored by the city’s secretary of culture. The purpose of the event is to promote the circus arts.

Public high schools of the &quot;Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal&quot; (IEMS) include:
* Escuela Preparatoria Milpa Alta &quot;Emiliano Zapata&quot;

The Otilio Montaño Library is in Tlacoyucan.

==Transportation==
Public transportation includes thirteen major bus route connecting the borough to Metro Tasqueña, Metro Tlahuac, the Central de Abastos, La Merced Market, Xochimilco and Santa Martha Acatitla, along with 23 smaller routes which are operated by private contractors. It takes about two hours by public transportation to travel from the center of Mexico City to Villa Milpa Alta. It can take up to three if traffic is bad, but lately, the subway made close Milpa Alta to the rest of the city via Tecomitl. For a short time beginning in the late 1980s, Milpa Alta was also served by trolleybuses of Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos, with a route from Tláhuac, but this service lasted only from October 1988 to early 1991.

Most of the borough is accessible by road. This has facilitated problems such as illegal logging and irregular homesteading. The main access roads to the borough are the federal highway connecting the south of the city with Oaxtepec in Morelos, the highway connecting San Pablo-Xochimilco and the Tulyehualco-Milpa Alta road.

==Landmarks==

Most of the borough’s landmarks are churches and chapels dating from the colonial period. 
The Santa Marta Chapel is considered to be the founding church of Milpa Alta. From here the churches of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries were founded. The first of these is the Parish of the Assumption of Mary constructed in the 16th century along with its former monastery in Villa Milpa Alta. Other colonial era churche/chapels include Nuestra Señora de la Concepción Chapel (1767), Santa Cruz Chapel, San Agustín el Alto Chapel (16th century), San Francisco de Asís Chapel (16th century), San Jeronimo Chapel (16th century), San Juan Bautista Chapel (16th, 17th and 19th centuries), San Lorenzo Martir Chapel (1605), Calvario Hermitage (16th and 17th centuries), San Pablo Apostol Parish (16th can 17th centuries), La Lupita Chapel (16th century), San Pedro Apostol Church (17th century), San Martin Chapel (16th and 17th centuries), Santa María de Guadalupe Chapel (16th and 17th centuries), San Francisco Chapel (16th century), Divino Salvador Chapel (16th century), Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana Parish (17th century) and the San Bartolome Chapel (17th century).

La Casona is one of the most important civil buildings in Milpa Alta both because of its construction and because of its history. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century and was the home of Rafael Coronel. Another important structure is the former headquarters of the Liberation Army of the South, now a museum.

<text>La Magdalena Contreras () is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in the Mexico City. As of the 2010 census, it has a population of 239,086 inhabitants and is the third-least populous of Mexico City&#x27;s boroughs. It lies at an elevation of above sea level. It is named after two historically important communities—La Magdalena Atlitic and Colonia Contreras. The northern end of the borough is urbanized. The rest of Magdalena Contreras, with its mountains and ravines, is designated as a conservation zone. However, urban sprawl has put pressure on these conservation areas. In an effort to preserve the area&#x27;s forests and natural resources, the borough government has started promoting ecotourism.

==History==

The borough takes its name from the La Magdalena Atlitic, one of four communities with pre-Hispanic roots, and the Contreras neighborhood, an area noted for its textile mills until the 20th century.

Human settlements in the area date to between , or the latter Preclassic period. These settlements were mostly located in the Contreras area and were under the control of Cuicuilco . After Cuicuilco was destroyed by an eruption of the Xitle volcano, inhabitants fled to higher elevations. The higher elevations were inhabited by the Otomi or the Chichimeca who were hunter-gatherers that lived in a stateless society. These peoples existed alongside the Nahuatlaca. The Tepanec eventually came to dominate the area, making it part of the Coyoacán dominion. With the rise of the Aztec, the Tepanec were conquered and the area was renamed Atlitic—stone that drinks water—after a large rock which rose above a small lake. Four settlements date from the pre-Hispanic period, San Bernabé Ocotepec, San Nicolás Totolapan, La Magdalena Atlitic and San Jeronimo Aculco.

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Dominicans established a town and church dedicated to Mary Magdalene and changed the name of the area to Magdalena (de) Atlitic. The first to take advantage of the waters of the Río Magdalena, Jerónimo de León established the first water-powered saw mill in 1543. In the 17th century the Contreras family established a factory in the location that bears their name. At the end of the 18th century, a group of Spanish industrialists founded a textile factory which caused an increase in the economy and the population of the area. By the end of the 19th century, the river was powering four textile factories named El Águila Mexicana, Tizapán, Santa Teresa, and Loreto. These factories produced wool, cotton and cashmere thread, and cloth of various types and by the end of the century had the use of the Mexico City-Cuernavaca rail line for shipping. However, from the colonial period through most of the 19th century, the area was mostly populated by farm and textile laborers who lived in poor conditions.

The modern borough was a result of several reorganizations of the Federal District of Mexico City at the beginning of the 20th century. Initially the area was governed by a municipality system, but then by presidential decree in 1928 the municipality was abolished and it became one of the boroughs of Mexico City.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a political power struggle as part of the Mexican Revolution. The &quot;Club Democrático Antireelectionista Vicente Guerrero&quot; formed in 1911 to fight against the power of local strongmen.

The Mexico City-Cuernavaca rail line continued to operate through most of the 20th century with train &quot;501&quot; noted for carrying famous passengers between the two destinations. The line was officially shut down in 1997. The Contreras station was converted into a park.

The latter 20th century is marked by population growth, especially in the borough&#x27;s north end. In 1963, an extension of the Anillo Periférico ring road was constructed through the borough. The road brought people and prompted the development of housing projects in the 1970s for the city&#x27;s growing population. These developments include Santa Teresa, Pedregal II, Pueblo Nuevo, Potrerillo, El Rosal, El Tanque, and El Toro, heading west from the roadway.

In 1900, the area was completely rural, with a population of only 8,150 people mostly located in the town of La Magdalena. The borough&#x27;s population began growing quickly in the 1940s to over 40,000 in 1960, but by 1990 the population had reached over 195,000. Population growth continues but at a slower pace: 222,000 by 2000 and 229,000 in 2005. There is limited space for housing projects due to the geography of the area but population growth has prompted illegal settlements in conservation areas and in steep ravines where landslides are a danger.

==Geography==
Magdalena Contreras is located in the southwest area of the Federal District of Mexico City. It is bordered to the north, south, and east by the boroughs of Álvaro Obregón and Tlalpan with the State of Mexico to the west. It has a territory of accounting for 5.1% of the Federal District. It has an average altitude of above sea level. The borough is divided into forty seven official neighborhoods called colonias. The oldest of these are La Magdalena Contrereas, San Jerónimo Aculco, San Bernabé Ocotepec, and San Nicolás Totolapan.

Magdalena Contreras lies in the southwest area of the Valley of Mexico along the lower eastern slopes of the Sierra de las Cruces which is a volcanic mountain range. The geographic features of the borough stretch from foothills to the lower mountains of the volcanic range. The hills and mountains are separated by ravines and canyons. Major elevations include Cerro Panza (), Nezehuiloya (), Pico Acoconetla (), Cerro Palmitas (), Cerro Palmas (), Piedras Encimadas (), El Aguajito (), Tarumba (), Cerro del Judío (), Cerro Sasacapa (), and Cerro San Miguel () . Principle canyons and ravines which are located in the center of the borough include Tlalpuente, Cainotitas, Atzoma, and Tejocote.

The ravines and canyons are carved by streams and run off from freshwater springs. Some of these flow year round and others only during the summer rainy season. The most important springs are Pericos, Mal Paso, Apapxtla, Las Ventanas, Cieneguillas, Los Cuervos, and San Miguel. There are two major flows of water—the Río Magdalena and the Río Eslava. The Río Magdalena is the only free flowing river in the Federal District. It begins on the slopes of the Cerro La Palma in the Cuajimalpa borough. Some of the water is captured at a section of the Los Dinamos park to be treated at a plant but the rest flows down to the floor of the valley. The borough has little in the way of structured drainage for wastewater and rainwater. Much of the wastewater flows openly which has contaminated local streams, the Río Magdalena, and the supply of drinking water. The problem is serious enough in the urbanized area to affect the population&#x27;s health.

===Climate===
There are three main climates found in the borough. The urbanized part is temperate and semi-moist. Conservation areas between above sea level are semi-cold and semi-moist, and those areas above are semi-cold and moist. All areas receive most of their rainfall during the summer rainy season particularly in July. This precipitation can often take the form of hail, with fog common during the summer and in November and December. Snow is rare.
===Natural resources===
Wildlife and native flora are mostly restricted to the conservation areas of the southern two thirds of the borough. The vegetation of this conservation area is an important source for oxygenation in the Valley of Mexico. Vegetation varies by altitude. Tree species include oaks, holm oaks, and pines. Bushes, brush, and other vegetation is mostly deciduous and includes plants from the legume and cactus families. A number of ravines and some of the higher altitudes have species adapted to wetter climes including Alnus jorullensis, Salix bonpladiana, Fraxinus uhdei, Buddlei cordata, Pronus capuli, and Taxodium mucronatum. In the pre-Hispanic period, fauna was highly varied; however, many species, such as wildcats, wolves, coyotes, anteaters and many others, are no longer found due to human settlement and habitat loss. Smaller mammals such as rabbits and squirrels still remain, especially in the higher elevations. Various types of birds such as hummingbirds, carpenter birds, and more, along with various lizards, snakes, and amphibians remain.

The borough has important ecological and tourist centers but these are facing degradation from urban sprawl. The area is 73% under conservation with 18% in urban space. An estimated 3.5% of the conservation area has illegal settlements. The illegal settlements are problematic for the borough with most environmental damage occurring in or near them. For environmental and safety reasons, a significant problem is the illegal construction of residences on the steep slopes of ravines. These illegal settlements also generate a large number of dumps of solid and liquid waste into ravines which pollute the water supply. The borough states that there are 106 areas of construction, about 1,000 residences, at high risk of landslides during the rainy season. Efforts to combat these problems include relocating those residing in illegal settlements and developing ecotourism and other programs for those that own rural areas of the borough.

===Communities===

The four oldest communities in the borough are La Magdalena Atlitic, San Nicolás Totolapan, San Jerónimo Aculco, and San Barnabé Ocotepec, all of pre-Hispanic origin. The modern community of La Magdalena Atlitic is centered on a church which was founded in the 16th century as a hermitage. The current structure dates to 1760. In 1932, it was named a national monument. The church has a Baroque facade with raised patterns, fronted by a stone paved atrium which has a fountain with an image of the Archangel Michael. The main portal is flanked by Doric pilasters holding up an arch and a cornice to the choir window. Inside, at the base of the arches over the main altar, there are feather designs unique to Mexico.

The town of San Nicolás Totolapan is centered on the Plaza Cívica Benito Juárez. Its church was founded in 1535 over a former pre-Hispanic ceremonial center. It has as simple facade and a Baroque bell tower surrounded by gardens that contains a stone with inscriptions. San Jerónimo Aculco has a plaza called Plaza Cívica Lidice, named after a Czech town that attacked the Nazis in 1942. It contains Rosedal de Paz (Rose Garden of Peace) and mural called &quot;Campos de Luz y Muerte&quot; (Fields of Light and Death) by Ariosto Otero. The town of San Jerónimo Aculco dates back to the Toltec period. Its church was built in the 16th century by the Franciscans and maintains its open chapel and original baptismal font. Its facade is Baroque with sculpted sandstone. Its atrium dates to the 18th century. The San Baranbé Ocotepec church was built in the 16th century as part of evangelization efforts and dedicated to Barnabas. Its main altar is Baroque and there are archeological remains in its atrium.

History and population growth have led to other communities being established in the area. In the colonial period up until the 19th century, the main industry was textiles. Textile factories were built in the area now known as Colonia Contreras. The grounds of the former El Águila textile mill are now the Foro Cultural (Cultural Forum), inaugurated in 1979. Remains of the mill&#x27;s installations, such as its smokestack, still remain, but it is now a wooded area with an auditorium, gallery, offices, workshops and libraries. Near the Foro is the Purísima Concepción Church. It was founded in the 16th century, but the current structure was built in the 17th by the Contreras family, owners of the El Águila mill. It offered mass to textile workers. The area&#x27;s former rail station, Estación Ferrocarril de Cuernavaca, is now a park. It contains a large mural by Ariosto Otero called &quot;El viaje del siglo veinte&quot; (Voyage of the 20th Century) that features the &quot;501&quot; train. This train carried famous passengers such as Diego Rivera, Tin Tan, and Lilia Prado.

Although named for the Magdalena and Contreras areas, the borough&#x27;s main institutions are in Colonial Barranca Seca. These include the civic plaza, the municipal building, and the Centro Cultural La Magdalena Contreras, which is in a former 1940s movie theater . Other notable, modern communities include the Unidad Habitacional de Servicios Sociales, which was established in 1960, Ampliación Lomas de San Bernabé, El Tanque, and La Malinche.

==Economy==

The borough is mostly residential in the northern third and mostly rural, agricultural, and conservation area in the south. The major population centers are found in the lower elevations of the central section of the borough.

For both environmental and economic reasons, ecotourism is an important aspect of the borough economy. The borough government has promoted this development over the past twenty years by encouraging major landholders to develop ecotourism parks and other measures. It established a tourism corridor mostly focused on the older communities and natural areas. Magdalena Atlitic was declared a Barrio Magico with a &quot;tourism market&quot; located just outside the entrance to Los Dinamos. Established in 2010 to encourage the area&#x27;s reputation for ecology, the Feria de la Trucha y la Quesadilla (Trout and Quesadilla Fair) occurs each year in this borough.

The borough has several major ecotourism areas. The largest of these is Los Dinamos Park which is part of the Bosques de la Cañada de Contreras conservation area. It has an area of that encompass a series of canyons formed by streams that eventually empty into Río Magdalena. The longest of these canyons is . The park has over of hiking paths which connect with those of San Nicolás Totolapan.The park also contains the remains of several former textile factories which used the rivers for power.

The ejido of San Nicolás Totolapan has two main ecotourism areas, one called &quot;Parque Ecoturístico&quot; and the other called &quot;Valle de Monte Alegre&quot; with a total area of . The ejido is located in the south of the borough, on the northwest slope of the Ajusco Volcano. The San Bernabé Ocotepec Ecotourism Park is located on the Cajetes and Meyuca mountains next to the community of the same name. It is of pine and oyamel fir forest and was established in 1998 to block the advance of urban sprawl. The Mazatepetl Eco-archeological Park is located on the San Bernabé Ocotepec ejido on a large hill called Cerro del Judío. It contains a restored pyramid originally constructed by the Otomi between 1200 CE and 1380 CE. Mazatepetl is one of oldest stone constructions in the Valley of Mexico.

==Culture==
Some of Magdalena Contrera&#x27;s rural character is still preserved in the observances of religious festivals. The Day of the Cross (May 3) is a popular festival in the borough, especially in the La Cruz neighborhood and the Cerro de Judío. During Holy Week, the custom of erecting altars in honor of the Virgin of Sorrows is still observed. There is a traditional passion play depicting the passion and crucifixion of Christ during the week, with the main event on Good Friday at the Cerro de Judío. In addition, it is traditional to spend Holy Saturday at Los Dinamos. Holy Week events have drawn up to 80,000 people at Los Dinamos. In addition, the area has a major annual pilgrimage to Chalma during this week.

Another major traditional observance is Day of the Dead. This holiday has drawn up to 90,000 people to the borough, mostly to the cemeteries of San Bernabé, San Jerónimo and San Francisco.

<doc id="408609" wikidata="Q1323196" url="?curid=408609" title="Mike Thompson (California politician)">
<text>Charles Michael Thompson (born January 24, 1951) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for (known as the 1st congressional district until 2013, and the until 2023) since 1999. The district, in the outer northern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area, includes all of Lake and Napa counties and parts of Contra Costa, Solano, Yolo and Sonoma counties. Thompson chairs the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life, education and career==
Thompson was born in St. Helena, California, the son of Beverly Ann (née Forni) and Charles Edward Thompson. His father was of English ancestry and his mother was of Italian and Swiss descent. He was educated at California State University, Chico, served in Vietnam with the United States Army&#x27;s 173rd Airborne Brigade, was a vineyard owner and maintenance supervisor, taught Public Administration and State Government at San Francisco State University and California State University, Chico, and was a member of the California State Senate before entering the House.

==Early political career==

Thompson served as an aide to Jackie Speier (then a state assemblywoman) before winning election to the California State Senate in 1990. He unseated 4th District incumbent Jim Nielsen after a controversy over Nielsen&#x27;s primary residence; Thompson&#x27;s margin of victory was less than 1%.

After the 1992 general election, State Senator Barry Keene of the neighboring 2nd District resigned. Thompson, whose hometown of St. Helena had shifted from the 4th District into the 2nd after reapportionment, ran in the 1993 special election for Keene&#x27;s seat. He narrowly beat Republican businesswoman Margie Handley and was elected to a full term in 1994.

National Democrats approached Thompson about running for Congress in 1996 against freshman Republican Frank Riggs. Thompson&#x27;s state Senate district was virtually coextensive with the congressional district. Thompson declined, believing his Senate seniority would be more beneficial to his district than would his being a freshman U.S. congressman. But in 1998, Thompson was due to be termed out of the state Senate, and opted to run for Congress. Riggs did not seek reelection to his House seat and made an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. Thompson was elected by almost a 30% margin and has been reelected ever since without substantive opposition, turning what was a swing district for most of the 1980s and &#x27;90s into a fairly safe Democratic seat.

For his first seven terms, Thompson represented a district stretching from the far northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area all the way to the North Coast. But after the 2010 census, his district was renumbered as the 5th and made somewhat more compact, losing most of its northern part to the 2nd District.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Thompson is a member of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition. Nonetheless, as of October 2021 he had voted in line with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time. Thompson voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

===Political positions===
====Abortion====
Thompson is a Roman Catholic, but is pro-choice. In May 2004, he and 47 other Catholic Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, D.C., to dissuade him from refusing to administer Holy Communion to Catholic members who voted in favor of pro-choice legislation. In February 2006, Thompson was one of 55 Democratic U.S. representatives identifying as Catholic who signed a &quot;Statement of Principles&quot; that affirmed a commitment to their faith but acknowledged opposition to Catholic doctrine on some issues. They wrote that on those issues, such as abortion rights, they would follow their conscience instead of the church&#x27;s teachings. In response, the U.S. Catholic Bishops issued a &quot;Statement on Responsibilities of Catholics in Public Life&quot; that said, in part, &quot;Catholic teaching calls all Catholics to work actively to restrain, restrict and bring to an end the destruction of unborn human life.&quot;

Thompson opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;an assault on women.&quot;

====Cannabis====
In 2015, Thompson proposed tougher penalties for marijuana growers who operate on trespassed land. The United States Sentencing Commission adopted the tougher sentencing guidelines, which went into effect in November 2015, after a six-month congressional review. The guidelines were intended to increase public safety.

====Environmental issues====
Thompson voted for President George W. Bush&#x27;s Healthy Forests Initiative, which some environmentalists saw as a favor to the timber industry. He has disappointed some environmentalists with votes against limits to new commercial logging roads in Alaska&#x27;s Tongass National Forest and against limits to hunting bears over bait. He was also one of only 30 Democrats to vote against an amendment to maintain roadless areas protected under the Roadless Rule. Thompson received a B rating from the American Wilderness Coalition in 2003 and an A+ in 2004.

The Sierra Club endorsed Thompson for reelection in 2010.

Thompson has voted several times to weaken the Clean Water Act.

In March 2012, Thompson and state Assemblyman Jared Huffman voiced their opposition to a piece of water legislation that the House would be voting on, which Thompson argued would &quot;kill local jobs, ignore 20 years of established science and overturn a century of California water law.&quot;

====Foreign policy====
In late 2002, Thompson joined Representatives Jim McDermott and David Bonior on a fact-finding trip to Iraq. During the trip, they spoke to officials in Baghdad and residents of Basra. They expressed skepticism about the Bush administration&#x27;s claims that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.

On March 26, 2008, Muthanna Al-Hanooti, an official of a Michigan charity, was accused of underwriting three members of Congress to travel to Iraq on behalf of Iraqi intelligence officials. McDermott&#x27;s office was already organizing the trip when the charity offered to pay the trip expenses. McDermott&#x27;s spokesman claimed the charity was fully vetted by the U.S. government. He also stated that the representatives obtained a license from the State Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control for the group to travel to Iraq.

Thompson has supported military intervention in certain foreign countries.

====Health care====
Thompson has supported a public option for health insurance. In 2009, he wrote, &quot;[b]y streamlining health care, reducing fraud and abuse, ending unnecessary testing, discouraging over-utilization, investing in smart reforms, and emphasizing preventive health care, we can significantly bring down the cost of health care.&quot; In 2010, Thompson voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

===Committee assignments===

For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Health
** Subcommittee on Tax (Ranking Member)

===Caucus memberships===
* Blue Dog Coalition
* Co-chair of the Congressional Wine Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus
* Climate Solutions Caucus
* U.S.-Japan Caucus

==Electoral history==
==Personal life==

Thompson is married to Janet Thompson. They met at a party in Yountville, California. They reside in St. Helena and also maintain a home in Washington, D.C.

The Thompsons are avid home cooks and cook for fundraisers to benefit local nonprofits, such as for renovations to the Point Reyes Lighthouse, and Thompson&#x27;s campaigns. Local Napa Valley wineries often sponsor Thompson&#x27;s campaigns with lunches, dinners, wine tastings and tours. Thompson is also a longtime volunteer for the Napa Valley wine auction fundraiser.

<text>Robert Takeo Matsui (, September 17, 1941 – January 1, 2005) was an American politician from the state of California. Matsui was a member of the Democratic Party and served in the U.S. House of Representatives as the congressman for California&#x27;s 5th congressional district from 1979 until his death at the end of his 13th term.

The Robert T. Matsui United States Courthouse in Sacramento is named in his honor.

==Early life and education==
A third-generation Japanese American, Matsui was born in Sacramento, California, and was six months old when he and his family were taken from Sacramento and interned by the U.S. government at the Tule Lake War Relocation Center in 1942.

Matsui graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1963 with a B.A. in political science, and then from the Hastings College of Law in 1966. He founded his own Sacramento law practice in 1967.

==Political career==

In 1971, Matsui was elected to the Sacramento City Council. He won re-election in 1975 and became vice mayor of the city in 1977.

In 1978, Matsui ran for the Democratic nomination in what was then the 3rd district after 12-term incumbent John E. Moss announced his retirement. He won a five-way Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote, besting a field that included State Assemblyman Eugene Gualco and Sacramento Mayor Phil Isenberg.

He defeated Republican Sandy Smolley with 53 percent of the vote. He would never face another contest nearly that close in what has long been the most Democratic district in interior California, and would be reelected 13 times. After his initial contest, he never dropped below 68 percent of the vote. He was reelected in 1982 with no major-party opposition, and was unopposed in 1984. His district was renumbered as the 5th district after the 1990 census.

In 1988, Matsui succeeded in helping pass the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which produced an official apology from the Federal government for the World War II internment program and offered token compensation to victims. He was also instrumental in the designation of Manzanar internment camp as a national historic site and in obtaining land in Washington, D.C. for the memorial to Japanese-American patriotism in World War II.

He was a chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, ranking member of the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, and third-ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. During his term he was noted for his staunch opposition to privatization of Social Security. He had a mostly liberal voting record having opposed the Defense of Marriage Act, the ban on partial-birth abortions, and the Private Securities and Litigations Reform Act.

In what would be his last election, 2004, he faced Republican Mike Dugas and easily won a 14th term with 71.4% of the vote, compared to Dugas&#x27; 23.4%. Opponents Pat Driscoll (Green Party) and John Reiger (Peace and Freedom Party), won 3.4% and 1.8% of the vote, respectively. (DCCC chairs are chosen in part because they are not expected to face serious competition for re-election.)

==Personal life==
He was married to Doris Okada who, until December 1998, worked as deputy assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Public Liaison for President Bill Clinton, leaving to become senior advisor and director of government relations at the firm of Collier Shannon Scott, PLLC before winning election to her late husband&#x27;s seat. The Matsuis had one son, Brian, who received his undergraduate and Juris Doctor degree from Stanford University.

===Death===
On December 24, 2004, Matsui entered Bethesda Naval Hospital with pneumonia. It was a complication from myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare stem cell disorder that causes an inability of the bone marrow to produce blood products, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. He died of pneumonia on January 1, 2005.

In the special election on March 8 to fill the vacant seat, Matsui&#x27;s widow Doris won with over 68 percent of the vote; she was sworn in on March 10, 2005.

<doc id="408611" wikidata="Q1368417" url="?curid=408611" title="Wally Herger">
<text>Walter William Herger Jr. (born May 20, 1945) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1987 to 2013. A member of the Republican Party, his district was the state&#x27;s largest congressional district by area. It covered almost all of interior Northern California including Chico, Redding and Red Bluff. On January 10, 2012, Herger announced he would not seek re-election in November.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Herger was born in Yuba City, California. He is of Swiss descent; his paternal grandfather emigrated to the US from the canton of Uri in the late 19th century. He is also of German and Irish descent. Herger was raised on his family&#x27;s cattle ranch and plum farm in the northern California town of Rio Oso (between Yuba City and Sacramento). He worked in the family&#x27;s oil and gas exploration business.

He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when he was about 20 years old. He graduated from American River College with an Associate of Arts. He also attended California State University, Sacramento for a year. His political career started in 1976, with his election to the East Nicolaus School Board. He also served northern California in the California State Assembly from 1980 to 1986.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Herger was easily reelected to Congress due to the &quot;safe&quot; Republican voter registration advantage in this district, but his election campaigns were challenged by Democratic candidates in his last campaigns. The district often fields a candidate registered with a third party, such as the Libertarian party and, during the 1990s, the Natural Law Party.

In 2002 and 2004, Herger defeated Democrat Mike Johnson, garnering 67% of the vote in 2004. In 2006, Herger faced Arjinderpal Sekhon and received 64% of the vote. In 2008, Herger faced Trinity County Supervisor Jeff Morris, who did somewhat better, holding Herger to 57% of the vote.

In 2010, Herger faced a Republican primary challenge from retired Colonel Pete Stiglich, and ran in the general against Democrat Jim Reed, a lawyer who divides his time between the Bay Area and Fall River. Herger prevailed with 57% of the vote.

===Tenure===

Herger served on the influential United States House Committee on Ways and Means since his tenure began as a federal representative. Within Ways and Means, Representative Herger served on two subcommittees, the Subcommittee on Trade, and the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support. In the 110th Congress he was named the Ranking Member of the Republican (minority) delegation to the Trade Subcommittee. Representative Herger&#x27;s participation in full committee is limited to Ways and Means, in accordance with the rules of the Committee on Ways and Means. While he chaired the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support (called the Subcommittee on Human Resources during his watch) beginning with the 107th Congress, he played a leading role in the reauthorization and expansion of the 1996 welfare reform law. He sponsored the &quot;Criminal Welfare Prevention Act&quot;, passed as part of the larger 1996 Welfare Reform Law. This bill gave additional financial incentives to law enforcement agencies that identified fraudulent recipients of aid.

On August 18, 2009, Herger triggered controversy when he attended a town hall meeting in Redding, California, where an audience member introduced himself as a &quot;proud right-wing terrorist&quot; The person admitted to reporters in a private interview ten days later, after the controversy had reached national attention, that he had misspoken, having intended to say &quot;extremist&quot;. Herger did not immediately distance himself from the remark then and there, but, instead, after the constituent&#x27;s lengthy comment, responded by saying, &quot;Amen. God bless you. There goes a great American.&quot; Many people, both inside and outside Herger&#x27;s congressional district found his failure to respond immediately unacceptable. Herger&#x27;s gaffe attained the apotheosis of national media attention when Keith Olbermann picked the story up for his show &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; on August 28, 2009.

;Legislative goals
The 2nd congressional district is driven by agriculture. Herger supported legislation to bolster free and fair trade in an effort to support his constituency. Congressman Herger, from his position on the Trade Subcommittee, planned to lead the consideration of trade agreements with foreign nations. He worked on the &quot;Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act&quot;, which instituted a framework for managing federal forest assets that will be tested on federal lands in Lassen, Plumas, and Tehama counties, and has been negotiated by a diverse coalition that includes environmental and logging interests. The act aims to reduce vegetation density in Forest Service lands, while expanding forest biodiversity (i.e. reduction of &quot;monoculture&quot; forests).

Congressmen Herger and Meek (D-FL) drafted a bill to repeal the three percent withholding tax scheduled to begin in 2011. The withholding tax would apply to governments with expenditures of greater than US$100 million on services from for-profit companies. The law mandates that governments will only deliver 97 percent of a contract to the contractor, and send the remaining 3% to the IRS. Vendors and contractors are expected to increase their bid values to cover this new cost. The National Association of Counties thinks that this will give Counties a competitive disadvantage when dealing with vendors and contractors. (Counties assess costs of federal &#x27;3-percent withholding law&#x27;)

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Trade
** Subcommittee on Health (chairman)

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Biomass Caucus
* Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans
* Republican Study Committee
* Tea Party Caucus

==Personal life==
Herger is married to Pamela Sargent, with whom he has 9 children and 19 grandchildren. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and used to sit on the United States House Committee on Ways and Means.

<doc id="408612" wikidata="Q1251831" url="?curid=408612" title="Doug Ose">
<text>Douglas Arlo Ose (born June 27, 1955) is an American businessman and politician who served as the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from 1999 to 2005. He is a member of the Republican Party. On March 16, 2021, Ose announced his intention to run for Governor of California in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election of Governor Gavin Newsom. On August 17, 2021, Ose announced that he was withdrawing from the race after suffering a heart attack.

==Early life and education==
Ose was born and raised in Sacramento, California. He graduated from Rio Americano High School and in 1977, earned a B.S. in business administration from the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, he was a member of Sigma Nu. After graduating from college, Ose began his career as a real estate developer.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

During his time in Congress, Ose was named a &quot;Hero of the Taxpayers&quot; by Americans for Tax Reform, a &quot;Guardian of Small Business&quot; by the National Federation of Independent Business and earned a &quot;Tax Fighter&quot; award from the National Tax Limitation Committee.

In 2001, Ose voted for one of the largest tax cuts in American history, a $1.35 trillion tax reform package that ended the marriage penalty tax, lowered the estate tax and increased child tax credits.

In December 2003, Ose introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of George Carlin&#x27;s &quot;seven dirty words&quot;, including &quot;compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)&quot;. The bill omitted &quot;tits&quot;, but included &quot;asshole&quot;, which was not one of Carlin&#x27;s original seven words. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution in January 2004, where it was tabled.

As Chairman of a House Government Reform Committee, Ose held hearings to promote legislation to change rules governing gifts to presidents.

In an effort to complete construction of a border fence originally started in 1996, Ose, along with David Dreier, co-authored a bill that would grant the United States Secretary of Homeland Security authorization to ignore all laws deemed &quot;necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section&quot;.

According to &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, during his congressional tenure, Ose appeared regularly in lists of the wealthiest members of Congress. This was based on the value of his real estate holdings purchased in the 1980s. According to financial disclosures his net worth is between $51.5 million and $175 million.

Ose honored a self-imposed term-limit pledge and declined to run for re-election to the U.S. House in 2004.

===Committee assignments===
* House Government Reform Committee (Chair)
* House Agriculture Committee
* House Financial Services Committee

==Elections==
===Congressional===
====1998–2002====
In 1998, Ose decided to run for California&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. In the open primary, he ranked first with 30% of the vote. His next closest competitor, Democrat Sandie Dunn, received 23% of the vote.

Ose and Dunn qualified for the general election, in which Ose defeated Dunn by a margin of 52%–45%. Ose won re-election in 2000 with 56% of the vote and again in 2002 with 62% of the vote.

====2008====
In 2008, Ose ran in the primary election in California&#x27;s 4th congressional district, a seat being left vacant by retiring Congressman John Doolittle. Ose lost the primary bid to Tom McClintock.

====2014====

On September 3, 2013, Ose formally announced his candidacy for his old district, which had been renumbered as the 7th district, in hopes of facing freshman Democrat Ami Bera, who unseated Dan Lungren in 2012. On June 3, Ose qualified for the November general election by ranking second in the open primary with 26% of the vote. He defeated Republicans Igor Birman and Elizabeth Emken. Bera ranked first with 48% of the vote and faced Ose in the general election. The &quot;Rothenberg Political Report&quot; rated the contest as a &quot;Pure Toss-up&quot;; and even eight days after the November 4 election, the race was still undecided, with Bera leading Ose by just 711 votes at the time with 19,000 ballots yet to be counted. Ultimately, Ose lost the race to Bera by 0.8%.

===2018 California gubernatorial race===

Ose hinted in 2017 that he was considering running for Governor of California in the 2018 election, telling the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that he was &quot;gravely concerned&quot; about the state&#x27;s future, elaborating &quot;there&#x27;s no other way to describe it – we&#x27;ve gone backwards. I don&#x27;t care whether you&#x27;re talking about housing or quality of jobs that are available or road maintenance or the homeless question. There&#x27;s nobody in office today that&#x27;s doing anything about it.&quot; He announced he would run in January 2018. In February, however, Ose determined this was not the right time. While discussing his decision to not pursue the office at that time, Ose told Fox Business&#x27; Stuart Varney: &quot;Cost of housing is out of control, K-12&#x27;s failing, homeless everywhere, traffic gridlock, no jobs, it&#x27;s just like...go down the checklist and they&#x27;re 0 for life.&quot; Ose then formed Rebuild California Foundation, a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Educational Organization, to research and propose solutions for the top issues affecting the lives of everyday Californians.

===2021 California gubernatorial recall race===
On March 16, 2021, Ose announced his intention to run for Governor of California in the recall election of Gavin Newsom. However, on August 17, 2021, Ose announced he was dropping out of the race after suffering a heart attack. Despite having withdrawn from the race, he received 0.4% of the replacement candidate vote.

== Other notable work ==
Since his departure from Congress, Ose has been a member of the board of directors of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a more traditional conservative movement of Members of Congress. The 501(c)(4) is tied to more than 60 current Members of Congress.

==Personal life ==

Ose is married to Lynnda Ose. They have two daughters, Erika and Emily, who attended Ose&#x27;s former high school, Rio Americano High School. Their main residence is in the unincorporated area of Sacramento County.

In 2011, when budget constraints forced the closure of Gibson Ranch Park in Rio Linda, Ose applied to run the facility as its private operator. Since Ose began managing the park in April 2011, the regional park was open daily and welcomed about 250,000 visitors. The park, as of December 1, 2019, is now being managed by the Sacramento County Department of Regional Parks.

Along with then-Senator Barbara Boxer, Ose had a cameo appearance in the 2002 &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; episode &quot;Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days&quot;.
