<text>Office of Strategic Influence is the first studio album by American progressive rock band OSI, released by Inside Out Music on February 18, 2003. The album was recorded in June 2002 and mixed in August 2002 at the Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut.

Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos originally recruited Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy to work on a progressive metal album. When keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore (founder of Chroma Key and former Dream Theater member) joined the project, the musical direction of the album changed to become more focused on soundscapes and composition than musicianship. Sean Malone (of Cynic and Gordian Knot) and Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) also performed on the album.

The album is named after the Office of Strategic Influence, an organization set up after the September 11 attacks to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media, among other functions. The Office was shut after &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story on it; many of its operations were transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. The album&#x27;s lyrics were written by Moore in reaction to the September 11 attacks.

Critical reception of the album was generally positive, praising the band&#x27;s musicianship. Critics compared the band&#x27;s sound to Porcupine Tree. Portnoy was ultimately dissatisfied with the experience of making the album. He performed on the second OSI album, &quot;Free&quot;, but was replaced by Gavin Harrison for &quot;Blood&quot; and &quot;[Fire Make Thunder]]&quot;, the band&#x27;s third and fourth albums respectively.

==Background==
Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos originally started work on &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; as a side project while his bandmates took a break before starting work on their next album. Matheos decided to work with Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy because the two had wanted to work on a project together for some time. They originally planned to form a supergroup, envisaging the album as &quot;straight prog metal&quot;.

Matheos spent seven months writing material for the album. He then sent Kevin Moore (who was living in Costa Rica) some MP3 files of the music he had written and asked him to write some keyboard parts. Moore (known as a founding member of Dream Theater and for his solo career as Chroma Key) had previously performed on three Fates Warning albums, and Matheos was expecting him to write keyboard parts as he had for the Fates Warning album. Instead, Moore &quot;messed with [Matheos&#x27;] tracks and switched things around and put vocals to it and stuff like that.&quot; He said that he no longer considered the keyboard, bass and guitar parts separate from each other: &quot;I don&#x27;t write like that any more as much as I&#x27;m composing a whole song.&quot; The resulting track would become &quot;Hello, Helicopter!&quot;

Moore emailed his work back to Matheos, who was &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; to be sent something completely different from what he expected. Matheos wanted to create a heavy album; before deciding to takes Moore&#x27;s ideas further, Matheos and Moore wrote what would become &quot;OSI&quot;. Moore said that after that, &quot;[Matheos] was pretty much comfortable with whatever I wanted to do.&quot; This new song format was very different from what Portnoy and Matheos originally planned: the already-written long tracks were split into multiple short songs, closer to Moore&#x27;s project Chroma Key than traditional progressive metal. &quot;The Thing That Never Was&quot;, a track on the bonus disc, shows the direction Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to take the album in.

Matheos and Portnoy initially considered having a different vocalist perform on each track; this idea was scrapped as they decided the constant change in vocalist would disrupt the flow of the album. Vocalists considered included Steve Walsh, Steve Hogarth, Steven Wilson and John Arch. Portnoy particularly pushed for Daniel Gildenlöw to sing on the album. Early on in the album&#x27;s production, Gildenlöw wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics for two songs and completely wrote another song. Matheos liked Gildenlöw&#x27;s ideas, but did not want to take the music in the same direction Gildenlöw did. Moore ended up performing most of the vocals on the album. In order to keep the album from becoming too similar to Chroma Key, Matheos and Portnoy decided to feature a guest vocalist on one track. Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) wrote lyrics and performed vocals on the track &quot;ShutDOWN&quot;. He was chosen because his music in Porcupine Tree was similar in style to the music on the album. Portnoy also credited Wilson as &quot;a pioneer of his genre&quot;.

Bassist Sean Malone (of Cynic and Gordian Knot) was only credited as a guest musician. Portnoy explained that this was because Malone&#x27;s schedule did not allow him to join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy in the basic tracking sessions.

==Recording==
&quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; was recorded at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from June 2 to 9, 2002. Matheos and Moore mixed the album with Phil Magnotti (who had previously mixed for Fates Warning) in August. Portnoy pushed to get as much of the band together as possible for the main tracking sessions because of his dislike of &quot;side projects done through mail.&quot;

Matheos and Moore created the basic song ideas in Pro Tools. Songs in the progressive metal vein were almost entirely written by Matheos, while Moore had more influence on the more vocal-driven tracks. Portnoy noted that they were ultimately &quot;Jim&#x27;s songs&quot;, but that Moore was very involved with arrangements, post-production, melodies and lyrics. Portnoy considered himself as &quot;just a drummer&quot;: he made minor arrangement suggestions but did not have a part in the actual writing. Malone and Wilson contributed their parts after the songs had been arranged. Matheos saved any unused ideas for the next Fates Warning album.

Sean Malone said that he enjoyed playing on the album, but that &quot;it would have been nice to work out parts with Mike as they were being recorded rather than after the fact&quot;. He took a &quot;session approach&quot; to the album, &quot;trying as much as possible to create parts that fit what Jim et al had created, versus trying to impose anything upon it&quot;. He was sent MIDI bass parts for each song which served as a guideline. For the particularly sparse and texture-heavy tracks, Malone did much doubletracking to create &quot;a natural kind of chorusing&quot; he prefers to any digital effects.

Before the recording of &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot;, the last time Moore and Portnoy worked together was on Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Awake&quot; in 1994. Matheos was initially concerned about how Moore and Portnoy would feel about working together for the first time in eight years. Moore noted that he and Portnoy were not on bad terms, but &quot;just weren&#x27;t in touch.&quot; The two both described the experience as initially &quot;awkward&quot;. When recording the album Portnoy had to take directions from others; he found this difficult as he was used to taking the creative lead. Moore noted that there was tension when recording the same drum part for a song more than once (in order to give Moore choice later on): &quot;He&#x27;s used to just playing the stroke once, the way he wants to,&quot; he said.

In a 2009 interview, Portnoy blamed his frustration with the project on Moore:

Portnoy performed as a session musician on the second OSI album, &quot;Free&quot;, but was replaced by Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison for the third album, &quot;Blood&quot;.

==Music==

Moore described the music on &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; as &quot;a new approach to progressive rock&quot;, stating that he could use his musical roots in progressive music but &quot;was far enough away from it to play with it.&quot; He said that &quot;progressive rock has been around for so long and we have to stop taking it so seriously and really have fun with it.&quot; Portnoy described the album as &quot;more soundscapish&quot; than his work in Dream Theater, focusing more on composition and sounds than musicianship. He noted the style &quot;would never work in Dream Theater.&quot;

Moore wrote lyrics for the album by &quot;mumbling along to the song and then deciphering what I&#x27;m saying.&quot; The lyrics feature political themes (&quot;Hello, Helicopter!&quot; is about the US supplying military arsenals to other countries to protect its own national interests), although Matheos stated that the album was not political in nature. Moore said that he writes lyrics based on personal experiences, and that much of the album&#x27;s lyrical content stems from how the September 11 attacks affected him. Moore&#x27;s brother was a firefighter who worked at the World Trade Center after the attacks, &quot;and I was totally apolitical before this, politically naïve and I still am,&quot; Moore stated. &quot;I was like, &#x27;Whoa, what the fuck is going on in the world?&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; features Moore&#x27;s signature use of spoken word samples. He collected samples first and then tried to match them with the song&#x27;s tempo. Moore said that the samples relate directly to the song&#x27;s lyrics.

Matheos listed his influences as progressive rock bands such as Genesis, Jethro Tull and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, UFO and Uriah Heep. Moore described his influences as minimal techno, experimental electronic musicians and &quot;bands that play live and then chop it up&quot;. He specifically named Pole, The Gordons and Acid Undertones as influences. Malone cited Mick Karn as an influence.

==Release and promotion==
Moore chose the album&#x27;s name from a list of band, album and song names he kept. The Office of Strategic Influence was a highly secret organization set up three weeks after the September 11 attacks. Part of its mission was to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media in order to &quot;influence the hearts and minds of the opposition.&quot; After &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a story on the Office in February 2002, it was forced to shut, although many of its operations were later transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. &quot;The funny thing about it was the government and administration was saying it&#x27;s so embarrassing that they had to name it the &#x27;Office of Strategic Influence,&#x27; we couldn&#x27;t just put it in a room in the Pentagon and name it whatever the room number is,&quot; Moore said. &quot;Someone decided to be really creative about it and name it what it really is.&quot;

The limited edition bonus CD features three bonus tracks on it. There are two cover songs: a cover of the Pink Floyd song &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; performed by Moore and Portnoy, chosen because they both &quot;love Pink Floyd&quot;, according to Portnoy, and a cover of the Neil Young song &quot;New Mama&quot; performed by Moore. The third track, entitled &quot;The Thing That Never Was&quot;, is a seventeen-minute instrumental performed by Matheos and Portnoy, showing the original direction they intended to take the album in. The CD contains a 19-minute multimedia section, including two documentary-style videos shot during the album&#x27;s recording, and a music video for the track &quot;Horseshoes and B-52s&quot; directed by Moore.

Matheos suggested using an altered version of the United States passport for the album&#x27;s cover art. The differences are that the arrows are double-headed, the olive branch is wilted, and the eagle&#x27;s wings have been clipped. Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date in order to prevent an early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.

==Reception==

&quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; was critically well received. Keith Gordon of AllMusic praised the album as &quot;offering both power and pomp.&quot; Tommy Hash of Prog4you.com described the music as &quot;catchy, complete with great melodies and musicianship that does not overdo it.&quot; He described the album as &quot;almost in complete contrast to the parent bands&#x27; other related side projects,&quot; such as Liquid Tension Experiment and Transatlantic. John Bollenberg of ProgressiveWorld.net praised Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for &quot;[starting] from scratch without copying their past in order to deliver something fresh, new and exciting.&quot;

Hash described the album as having &quot;the atmosphere of some of the mid-90s to the latter era Fates Warning fused with industrial sounding elements and sound effects that create an ambient effect.&quot; Gordon described the music as similar to Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Max Vague. Bollenberg noted &quot;the material on &quot;Office Of Strategic Influence&quot; gets closer to Moore&#x27;s very own Chroma Key mixed with dashes of latterday Porcupine Tree... there are bits and bobs all over the album that could easily have fit on &quot;In Absentia&quot;.&quot;

Gordon described the performances on the album as &quot;crackling with electricity and passion&quot;. He lauded Matheos&#x27; performance on the album: &quot;In any other subgenre of rock, Matheos would be a guitar hero on the order of Steve Vai or Eddie Van Halen, the Fates Warning frontman capable of both classically styled acoustic craftsmanship and chaotic metallic riffing, often in the context of the same song.&quot; He praised Malone and Portnoy for &quot;[holding] down the bottom line with rock-solid rhythms&quot;.

Gordon praised Moore for &quot;providing an instrumental counterpoint to Matheos&#x27; raging guitar. Moore&#x27;s imaginative style and natural skill coax a myriad of sounds from his instrument to challenge Matheos in the mix.&quot; Sander noted Moore&#x27;s contribution, saying that &quot;at times there&#x27;s more technology and electronics than in the average house release&quot;. Bollenberg noted that Moore&#x27;s keyboards added &quot;textures flirting with semi-industrial patches and often being closer to Nine Inch Nails than &#x27;vintage&#x27; melodic prog.&quot; Hash praised Moore&#x27;s vocals, noting they &quot;fit in well with all of the instrumental textures&quot;. In contrast, Sander criticized Moore&#x27;s voice as &quot;dull&quot;: &quot;the many added distortion and echo effects cannot always make it more interesting. His voice is okay for one or two tracks... but it&#x27;s too flat to keep you tied to the speakers for much longer&quot;. He cited Moore&#x27;s vocals as the main weakness of some tracks.

Bollenberg listed his favorite track as &quot;Hello, Helicopter!&quot;: &quot;it once again gets so very close to authentic Porcupine Tree with Portnoy introducing some tribal rhythms that go ever so well with the rest of the material. I simply melt once that superb sound of the Fender Rhodes enters, taking turns with synthesizer tweaks.&quot; Gordon described the instrumental parts of the album as &quot;powerful and purposeful: an integral part of each composition rather than an excuse to merely &#x27;jam&#x27;&quot;.

<text>A formal system is an abstract structure and formalization of an axiomatic system used for deducing, using rules of inference, theorems from axioms by a set of inference rules.

In 1921, David Hilbert proposed to use formal systems as the foundation of knowledge in mathematics.

The term formalism is sometimes a rough synonym for &quot;formal system&quot;, but it also refers to a given style of notation, for example, Paul Dirac&#x27;s bra–ket notation.

== Concepts ==
A formal system has the following:

* Formal language, which is a set of well-formed formulas, which are strings of symbols from an alphabet, formed by a formal grammar (consisting of production rules or formation rules).
* Deductive system, deductive apparatus, or proof system, which has rules of inference that take axioms and infers theorems, both of which are part of the formal language.

A formal system is said to be recursive (i.e. effective) or recursively enumerable if the set of axioms and the set of inference rules are decidable sets or semidecidable sets, respectively.

=== Formal language ===

A formal language is a language that is defined by a formal system. Like languages in linguistics, formal languages generally have two aspects:
* the syntax is what the language looks like (more formally: the set of possible expressions that are valid utterances in the language)
* the semantics are what the utterances of the language mean (which is formalized in various ways, depending on the type of language in question)

Usually only the syntax of a formal language is considered via the notion of a formal grammar. The two main categories of formal grammar are that of generative grammars, which are sets of rules for how strings in a language can be written, and that of analytic grammars (or reductive grammar), which are sets of rules for how a string can be analyzed to determine whether it is a member of the language.

===Deductive system===
A &quot;deductive system&quot;, also called a &quot;deductive apparatus&quot;, consists of the axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference that can be used to derive theorems of the system.

Such deductive systems preserve deductive qualities in the formulas that are expressed in the system. Usually the quality we are concerned with is truth as opposed to falsehood. However, other modalities, such as justification or belief may be preserved instead.

In order to sustain its deductive integrity, a &quot;deductive apparatus&quot; must be definable without reference to any intended interpretation of the language. The aim is to ensure that each line of a derivation is merely a logical consequence of the lines that precede it. There should be no element of any interpretation of the language that gets involved with the deductive nature of the system.

The logical consequence (or entailment) of the system by its logical foundation is what distinguishes a formal system from others which may have some basis in an abstract model. Often the formal system will be the basis for or even identified with a larger theory or field (e.g. Euclidean geometry) consistent with the usage in modern mathematics such as model theory.

An example of a deductive system would be the rules of inference and axioms regarding equality used in first order logic.

The two main types of deductive systems are proof systems and formal semantics.

==== Proof system ====

Formal proofs are sequences of well-formed formulas (or WFF for short) that might either be an axiom or be the product of applying an inference rule on previous WFFs in the proof sequence. The last WFF in the sequence is recognized as a theorem.

Once a formal system is given, one can define the set of theorems which can be proved inside the formal system. This set consists of all WFFs for which there is a proof. Thus all axioms are considered theorems. Unlike the grammar for WFFs, there is no guarantee that there will be a decision procedure for deciding whether a given WFF is a theorem or not. 

The point of view that generating formal proofs is all there is to mathematics is often called &quot;formalism&quot;. David Hilbert founded metamathematics as a discipline for discussing formal systems. Any language that one uses to talk about a formal system is called a &quot;metalanguage&quot;. The metalanguage may be a natural language, or it may be partially formalized itself, but it is generally less completely formalized than the formal language component of the formal system under examination, which is then called the &quot;object language&quot;, that is, the object of the discussion in question. The notion of &quot;theorem&quot; just defined should not be confused with &quot;theorems about the formal system&quot;, which, in order to avoid confusion, are usually called metatheorems.

==== Formal semantics of logical system ====
A &quot;logical system&quot; is a deductive system (most commonly first order logic) together with additional non-logical axioms. According to model theory, a logical system may be given interpretations which describe whether a given structure - the mapping of formulas to a particular meaning - satisfies a well-formed formula. A structure that satisfies all the axioms of the formal system is known as a model of the logical system. 

A logical system is:
*Sound, if each well-formed formula that can be inferred from the axioms is satisfied by every model of the logical system.
*Semantically complete, if each well-formed formula that is satisfied by every model of the logical system can be inferred from the axioms.

An example of a logical system is Peano arithmetic. The standard model of arithmetic sets the domain of discourse to be the nonnegative integers and gives the symbols their usual meaning. There are also non-standard models of arithmetic.

==History==
Early logic systems includes Indian logic of Pāṇini, syllogistic logic of Aristotle, propositional logic of Stoicism, and Chinese logic of Gongsun Long (c. 325–250 BCE) . In more recent times, contributors include George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, and Gottlob Frege. Mathematical logic was developed in 19th century Europe.

David Hilbert instigated a formalist movement called Hilbert’s program as a proposed solution to the foundational crisis of mathematics, that was eventually tempered by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. The QED manifesto represented a subsequent, as yet unsuccessful, effort at formalization of known mathematics.

<text>Edvin Loach, also Edwin Loach, is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Edvin Loach and Saltmarshe, in east Herefordshire, England, and about north of the town of Bromyard, and east from Edwyn Ralph civil parish. In 1961 the parish had a population of 18. On 1 April 1986 the parish was abolished and merged with Saltmarshe to form &quot;Edvin Loach &amp; Saltmarshe&quot;.

The old church at Edvin Loach was built in the mid-11th century or later and was dedicated to St Giles. It is built within the earthworks of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. Later it was re-dedicated to St Mary. The old church gradually became dilapidated, though its roof was still intact as late as the 1890s. It is in the guardianship of English Heritage. The new St Mary&#x27;s Church, designed by Victorian architect Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1860, stands next to the ruins of the old church. It is an example of 19th-century church architecture designed in Early English style.

<text>Guanosine diphosphate, abbreviated GDP, is a nucleoside diphosphate. It is an ester of pyrophosphoric acid with the nucleoside guanosine. GDP consists of a pyrophosphate group, a pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase guanine.

GDP is the product of GTP dephosphorylation by GTPases, e.g., the G-proteins that are involved in signal transduction.

GDP is converted into GTP with the help of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate.

== GDP and GTP ==

=== Hydrolysis of GTP into GDP ===
The hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is facilitated by GTPase enzymes, which utilize a conserved active site motif known as the GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Initially, a water molecule is coordinated by the active site residues of the GTPase enzyme. The water molecule attacks the γ-phosphate of GTP, leading to the formation of a pentavalent transition state. This transition state is stabilized by interactions with the active site residues, including conserved catalytic residues. As a result, the γ-phosphate is cleaved, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is released. This step also causes a conformational change in the enzyme that promotes the release of GDP.

== Biochemical functions ==

=== Intracellular signaling ===
GDP is involved in intracellular signaling processes functioning as a critical regulator in the activity of GTPases. GTPases act as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. The interconversion between GDP and GTP is tightly controlled and serves as a molecular timer for signal transduction pathways. When an extracellular signal triggers the activation of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the associated G-protein exchanges its bound GDP for GTP, leading to a conformational change and activation of downstream signaling cascades. This activation can stimulate a variety of cellular responses, including modulation of gene expression, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and regulation of enzymatic activities. The hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by the GTPase activity of the G-protein restoring the inactive state, thus terminates the signaling event.

In a type of intracellular signaling referred to as the Nuclear Import process, cytosolic proteins like alpha and beta importins would bind the nuclear localization sequence that is located within the protein, to which this complex would bind to a nuclear pore complex that allows for translocation into the nucleus. RanGTPase would bind to the beta importin which removes it from the complex, followed by the removal of the alpha importin which is also bound to the RanGTPase. While bound to the RanGTPase, the importins leave the nucleus where the Ran is hydrolyzed, converting the bound GTP into GDP. Ran-GDP can return the nucleus through its bind to a nuclear transport factor, where a Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Protein can come to catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP. We also see GTP hydrolysis in situations with Ras proteins in which the same reaction occurs.

<doc id="396116" wikidata="Q2589498" url="?curid=396116" title="Dominator (graph theory)">
<text>In computer science, a node of a control-flow graph dominates a node if every path from the &quot;entry node&quot; to must go through . Notationally, this is written as (or sometimes ). By definition, every node dominates itself.

There are a number of related concepts:

* A node &quot;strictly dominates&quot; a node if dominates and does not equal .
* The &quot;immediate dominator&quot; or idom of a node is the unique node that strictly dominates but does not strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates . Every node, except the entry node, has an immediate dominator.
* The &quot;dominance frontier&quot; of a node is the set of all nodes such that dominates an immediate predecessor of , but does not strictly dominate . It is the set of nodes where &#x27;s dominance stops.
* A &quot;dominator tree&quot; is a tree where each node&#x27;s children are those nodes it immediately dominates. The start node is the root of the tree.

== History ==
Dominance was first introduced by Reese T. Prosser in a 1959 paper on analysis of flow diagrams. Prosser did not present an algorithm for computing dominance, which had to wait ten years for Edward S. Lowry and C. W. Medlock. Ron Cytron &quot;et al.&quot; rekindled interest in dominance in 1989 when they applied it to the problem of efficiently computing the placement of φ functions, which are used in static single assignment form.

== Applications ==
Dominators, and dominance frontiers particularly, have applications in compilers for computing static single assignment form. A number of compiler optimizations can also benefit from dominators. The flow graph in this case comprises basic blocks.

Dominators play a crucial role in control flow analysis by identifying the program behaviors that are relevant to a specific statement or operation, which helps in optimizing and simplifying the control flow of programs for analysis.

Automatic parallelization benefits from postdominance frontiers. This is an efficient method of computing control dependence, which is critical to the analysis.

Memory usage analysis can benefit from the dominator tree to easily find leaks and identify high memory usage.

In hardware systems, dominators are used for computing signal probabilities for test generation, estimating switching activities for power and noise analysis, and selecting cut points in equivalence checking.
In software systems, they are used for reducing the size of the test set in structural testing techniques such as statement and branch coverage.

== Algorithms ==
Let formula_1 be the source node on the Control-flow graph. The dominators of a node formula_2 are given by the maximal solution to the following data-flow equations:

: formula_3

The dominator of the start node is the start node itself. The set of dominators for any other node formula_2 is the intersection of the set of dominators for all predecessors formula_5 of formula_2. The node formula_2 is also in the set of dominators for formula_2.

An algorithm for the direct solution is:

 // dominator of the start node is the start itself
 Dom(n0) = {n0}
 // for all other nodes, set all nodes as the dominators
 for each n in N - {n0}
 Dom(n) = N;
 // iteratively eliminate nodes that are not dominators
 while changes in any Dom(n)
 for each n in N - {n0}:
 Dom(n) = {n} union with intersection over Dom(p) for all p in pred(n)

The direct solution is quadratic in the number of nodes, or O(&quot;n&quot;2). Lengauer and Tarjan developed an algorithm which is almost linear, and in practice, except for a few artificial graphs, the algorithm and a simplified version of it are as fast or faster than any other known algorithm for graphs of all sizes and its advantage increases with graph size.

Keith D. Cooper, Timothy J. Harvey, and Ken Kennedy of Rice University describe an algorithm that essentially solves the above data flow equations but uses well engineered data structures to improve performance.

== Postdominance ==
Analogous to the definition of dominance above, a node &quot;z&quot; is said to post-dominate a node &quot;n&quot; if all paths to the exit node of the graph starting at &quot;n&quot; must go through &quot;z&quot;. Similarly, the immediate post-dominator of a node &quot;n&quot; is the postdominator of &quot;n&quot; that doesn&#x27;t strictly postdominate any other strict postdominators of &quot;n&quot;.

<doc id="396118" wikidata="Q666842" url="?curid=396118" title="Progress Quest">
<text>Progress Quest is a video game developed by Eric Fredricksen as a parody of &quot;EverQuest&quot; and other massively multiplayer online role-playing games. It is loosely considered a zero-player game, in the sense that once the player has set up their artificial character, there is no user interaction at all; the game &quot;plays&quot; itself, with the human player as spectator. The game&#x27;s source code was released in 2011.

==Gameplay==

On starting a new game, the player is presented with a few options, such as the choice of race and character class for their player character. Stats are rolled and unrolled to determine Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Players start off with subpar equipment, eventually earning better weapons, armor, and spells. Almost none of the above-mentioned character statistics and equipment have any effect on gameplay, however. The only exception is the Strength stat, which affects carrying capacity, indirectly influencing the speed of level gain.

After character creation the game runs its course. The game displays the character&#x27;s stats on the screen, including several progress bars representing how far the player character has advanced in the game. The lengthy, combat free prologue is represented by a set of progress bars, each accompanied by a line of text describing, among other things, the &quot;foreboding vision&quot; the character has. Then the first act begins, and the character is &quot;heading to the killing fields...&quot; where they will start the endless cycle of &quot;executing (&quot;number of monsters&quot;) (&quot;adjective of monsters&quot;) (&quot;monster type&quot;)&quot; or &quot;executing a passing (&quot;player character&quot;)&quot;, only disrupted when their strength is no longer sufficient to carry more items. This forces their return to the market, where they will sell all the loot (each group of monsters drops one monster-specific item of loot, player characters will drop random magic loot) and then spend all their accumulated money to buy equipment. With each group of monsters &quot;executed&quot; the quest progress bar will advance one step; once it is filled it will be reset and the player awarded either with a magic item, a piece of equipment or a stats upgrade including the learning or leveling of a spell. After a fixed amount of time, the player will enter a new act, which has no effect whatsoever.

All equipment in the game is randomly given out as a reward for several instances in the game such as completing a quest, killing certain enemies, leveling a character, and especially when at the market, in which the character uses gold from the loot to upgrade his or her equipment. These items usually consist of two adjectives and a noun. Like the games &quot;Progress Quest&quot; mocks, these items have statistics and the adjectives are variables describing the item. The character level is used to determine what stats and adjectives each item has.

Players may choose to create an account offline for their own enjoyment, or create an online multiplayer account that allows their character stats to be saved on a ranking website. This allows characters to compare their accomplishments with others while trying to achieve a higher ranking on their respective realm. Players can also join guilds of Good, Neutral, or Evil alignment in certain realms, though there is no benefit for doing so.

==Plot==
The story tells of the history of Grumdrig and the creation of the realms. Currently, there are six realms: Knoram, Expodrine, Oobag, Spoltog, Pemptus, and Alpaquil. The latter three are still open, but Knoram, Expodrine, and Oobag were permanently closed to the creation of new characters upon the arrival of Pemptus, which launched on February 8, 2007. On December 9, 2021, users found a mysterious &quot;Alpaquil&quot; realm on the guild pages. Fredricksen then released a beta version of the new realm, which would be exclusive to the in-browser version of the game. At first, it was only accessible through a link provided by Fredrickson, but on December 14 the realm was fully released to the public. The story mimics convoluted fantasy plots, using archaic and made up words such as &quot;aberdoxy&quot;.

==Development==

&quot;Progress Quest&quot; parodies the stat-gathering aspect of role-playing video games, in which the player advances their character by accumulating arbitrary statistic points. &quot;EverQuest&quot; and many other MMORPGs of its time are infamous for their &quot;auto-attack&quot; combat system, where players press a button to initiate combat mode and, from then on, have little to do other than watch; &quot;Progress Quest&quot; mocks this with its totally non-interactive gameplay after the initial character setup. &quot;Progress Quest&quot; also pokes fun at traditional RPG races, classes, stories, quests, items, and more.

The program was made available by Eric Fredricksen in early 2002. Fans quickly joined in on the parody by submitting numerous reviews to several popular freeware download sites and game review sites giving &quot;Progress Quest&quot; the highest scores possible.

The game has been updated several times throughout its history. One particular upgrade added shaded bars to the screen, which caused some players to refer to the new version as &quot;Progress Quest 3D&quot;. On the game&#x27;s now-deleted official forums, a popular in-joke leads newbies to believe that there exist Silver, Gold, Platinum or even Diamond-encrusted DVD versions of the game which have enhanced 3D graphics. Fake &quot;Progress Quest&quot; screenshots from other games, obscure 3D RPGs, helped spread this rumour.

In May 2011, Eric Fredricksen released the source code of the game on Bitbucket.

==Reception==
Critics have commented that, despite the automatic progress, &quot;Progress Quest&quot; was an enjoyable experience. Reviewer Nick Hide compared this with other MMORPGs in which players persevere through dull tasks, just to level up or obtain a new item, owing to an emotional attachment with the character.

&quot;Progress Quest&quot; arguably represents the first example of a genre of casual game called the &quot;idle RPG&quot; or &quot;incremental game&quot;, popular on certain web sites. These games generally feature a complex progress system in which progress is made automatically with the passage of time, but unlike &quot;Progress Quest&quot;, there are often decisions to be made by the player in terms of allocating resources between stats that &quot;do&quot; affect the game in order that the idled time should be used as efficiently as possible.

Bethesda Game Studios executive producer Todd Howard stated that &quot;Progress Quest&quot; influenced the &quot;Fallout&quot; mobile spin-off &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot;.

<text>Pamela Ayres MBE (born 14 March 1947) is a British poet, comedian, songwriter and presenter of radio and television programmes. Her 1975 appearance on the television talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; led to appearances on other TV and radio shows, a one-woman touring stage show and performing before the Queen.

==Early life==
Pam Ayres was born in Stanford in the Vale, Berkshire (now administered as part of Oxfordshire), the youngest of six children (having four elder brothers and a sister) of Stanley and Phyllis Ayres. Her father worked for 44 years as a linesman for the Southern Electricity Board, having been a sergeant in the Grenadier Guards during the Second World War. Ayres considered her upbringing &quot;a country childhood&quot;; she was raised in one of a row of small council houses.

After leaving Faringdon Secondary School at the age of 15, she joined the Civil Service as a clerical assistant and worked at the Army (RAOC) Central Ordnance Depot in Bicester. She soon left and signed up for the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force, where she trained as a Plotter Air Photographer, working at JARIC in a drawing office dealing with operational maps. While serving in the air force, she gained O-level passes in English language and English literature and began her career as an entertainer. On leaving the WRAF, she went through a number of jobs, before ending up at Smiths Industries, Witney, where she spent six years, working as a &#x27;Confidential Secretary&#x27;. While at Smiths, Ayres began performing at a local folk club, and this led eventually to an invitation to read on BBC Radio Oxford in 1974. Her reading of her poem &quot;The Battery Hen&quot; was re-broadcast as &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; on the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4, leading to a six-month contract with Radio Oxford. Her recital went on to feature as an item in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pick of the Year&quot;. In February 1976, she left Smiths to pursue poetry full-time. 

In September 2006, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Magazine Monitor&quot;&#x27;s &quot;10 Things...&quot;, claimed, though without providing details, to have learnt that week (&quot;1-8 Sep&quot;) that Bob Dylan inspired Ayres to write poetry. However, although Ayres has often spoken of her admiration of Dylan, in a 2015 interview, she stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t know that he [Dylan] ever was the inspiration to start writing poetry... I certainly loved him.&quot;
In a 2006 interview (aired on Radio New Zealand&#x27;s Nine To Noon programme, 24 October 2006), she stated that, at the age of twelve, she enjoyed writing parodies of the Lonnie Donegan songs popular at that time.

==Career==
In 1975, Ayres appeared on the television talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. This led to a wide variety of guest appearances on TV and radio shows. Since then she has published six books of poems, toured in a one-woman stage show, hosted her own TV show and performed her stage show for the Queen.

Her poetry has a simple style and deals with everyday subject matter. Her poem &quot;Oh, I Wish I&#x27;d Looked After Me Teeth&quot;, was voted into the Top 10 of a BBC poll to find the nation&#x27;s 100 Favourite Comic Poems. In the UK Arts Council&#x27;s report on poetry, Ayres was identified as the fifth best-selling poet in Britain in 1998 and 1999.

From 1996, Ayres has appeared frequently on BBC Radio: from 1996 until 1999 Ayres presented a two-hour music and chat show every Sunday afternoon on BBC Radio 2; this was followed by two series of &quot;Pam Ayres&#x27; Open Road&quot;, in which she visited various parts of the United Kingdom, interviewing people with interesting stories to tell about their lives and local areas. More recently Ayres has become a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4, appearing in programmes such as &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, &quot;Say the Word&quot;, &quot;That Reminds Me&quot;, and six series of her own show, &quot;Ayres on the Air&quot;, a radio show of her poetry and sketches.

In 2007, Ayres acted in a radio sitcom, &quot;Potting On&quot; for Radio 4, co-starring Geoffrey Whitehead. She wrote and recorded six series of her Radio 4 programme &quot;Ayres on the Air&quot;, the latest of which was broadcast in 2018.

Since 2002, Ayres has appeared a number of times on Channel 4 in &quot;Countdown&quot;&#x27;s Dictionary Corner alongside Susie Dent.

In 2009, she made her first appearance on the BBC TV programme, &quot;QI&quot;. In 2011 she said in a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; magazine interview that she was &quot;about to go on my 14th tour of Australia&quot;.

Her autobiography, &quot;The Necessary Aptitude: A Memoir&quot;, was published in 2011. It traces her life and career from growing as the youngest of six children in a council house in the Vale of the White Horse, Berkshire, her time in the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force and the string of events that led to &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. The title refers to the number of times she was told in her life she &quot;did not have the necessary aptitude&quot;.

In 2013, she published her latest book of poems, entitled &quot;You Made me Late Again!&quot;

In September 2021, her TV series &quot;The Cotswolds with Pam Ayres&quot; premiered on Channel 5. Each episode features a special guest and ends with Pam reciting a short, uplifting verse summing up her adventures. In 2022, the programme was recommissioned as &quot;The Cotswolds and Beyond with Pam Ayres&quot;, as the programme expanded its remit to have Ayres visit the market town of Pershore to meet Toyah Willcox, as well as going to the Henley Regatta with Steve Redgrave, the Dean Forest Railway and the gardens at Highgrove, where she met the then Prince of Wales.

She regularly performs her poetry at the Glastonbury Festival, most recently in 2024.

===Influence===
The poet John Cooper Clarke has cited Ayres&#x27;s early success on &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; as being highly influential on his career.

==Personal life==
Ayres is married to theatre producer Dudley Russell, and they have two sons, William and James. They live in Cirencester, Gloucestershire and keep rare breeds of cattle, as well as sheep, pigs, chickens, and guinea fowl. Ayres is a keen gardener and beekeeper. She is a patron of the British Hen Welfare Trust, Cheltenham Animal Shelter and Oak and Furrows Wildlife Rescue Centre.

Ayres was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1979 and again in 2018. On the first occasion, she chose &quot;The New St George&quot; by John and Chris Leslie, &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; by Frederick Forsyth, and a large basket of sugared almonds as her favourite song, book and luxury item respectively; on her second appearance she chose The Fureys&#x27; &quot;When You Were Sweet Sixteen&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose: From William Caxton to P.G.Wodehouse&quot; by Frank Muir, and a medicine cabinet including mosquito repellent.

In the 2004 Birthday Honours, Ayres was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to literature and entertainment.

<doc id="396136" wikidata="Q7281906" url="?curid=396136" title="Rae Armantrout">
<text>Rae Armantrout (born April 13, 1947) is an American poet generally associated with the Language poets. She has published more than two dozen books, including both poetry and prose. 

Armantrout was awarded the 2009 National Book Critics Circle Award for her book &quot;Versed&quot; which was also nominated for the National Book Award. &quot;Versed&quot; later received the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.

Armantrout is now retired from her long tenure teaching at the University of California, San Diego, where she was Professor of Poetry and Poetics.

==Early life==
Armantrout was born in Vallejo, California. An only child, she was raised among military communities on naval bases, predominantly in San Diego. In her autobiography &quot;True&quot; (1998), she describes herself as having endured an insular childhood, a sensitive child of working class, Methodist fundamentalist parents. 

In 1965, while living in the Allied Gardens district with her parents, Armantrout attended San Diego State University, intending to major in anthropology. During her studies she transferred to English and American literature, later studying at the University of California, Berkeley. 

At Berkeley, Armantrout studied with poet Denise Levertov and befriended Ron Silliman. The latter became an important friendship for both poets, as each of them would become associated with the “West Coast” contingent of the so-called Language poets of late 1980s San Francisco.

==Literary career and recognition==
Armantrout published poetry in &quot;Caterpillar&quot; in the early 1970s, and from this point began to view herself as a poet. She took a master&#x27;s degree in creative writing from San Francisco State University, and wrote &quot;Extremities&quot; (1978), her first book of poetry.

Armantrout&#x27;s poems have appeared in many anthologies, including &quot;In The American Tree&quot; (National Poetry Foundation), &quot;Language Poetries&quot; (New Directions), &quot;Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology&quot;, From the Other Side of the Century (Sun &amp; Moon), &quot;Out of Everywhere&quot; (Reality Street), &quot;American Women Poets in the 21st Century: Where Language Meets the Lyric Tradition&quot;, (Wesleyan, 2002), &quot;The Oxford Book of American Poetry&quot; (Oxford, UP, 2006) and several appearances in the annually published &quot;The Best American Poetry&quot;, including &quot;1988&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2002&quot;, &quot;2004&quot; and &quot;2007&quot;.

Armantrout has twice received a Fund For Poetry Grant and was a California Arts Council Fellowship recipient in 1989. In 2007 she received a Grants to Artists Award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008.

Armantrout was one of a group of ten poets who participated in &quot;The Grand Piano: An Experiment In Collective Autobiography.&quot; Writing for these volumes began in 1998 and the first of its 10 volumes was published in November 2006.

&quot;Wobble&quot;, published in November 2018, was a finalist for the 2018 National Book Award for Poetry.

==Style==
Armantrout was a member of the original West Coast Language group. Although Language poetry can be seen as advocating a poetics of nonreferentiality, Armantrout&#x27;s work, focusing as it often does on the local and the domestic, resists such definitions. Unlike most of the group, her work is firmly grounded in experience of the local and domestic worlds and she is regarded by some as the most lyrical of the Language Poets.

Armantrout credits William Carlos Williams for developing her &quot;sense of the line&quot; and her understanding that &quot;line breaks can create suspense and can destabilize meaning through delay.&quot; The basic unit of meaning in Armantrout&#x27;s poetry is either the stanza or the section, and she writes both prose poetry and more traditional stanza-based poems.

In a published interview with poet and novelist Ben Lerner for &quot;BOMB Magazine&quot;, Armantrout said that she is more likely to write a prose poem &quot;when [she] hear[s] the voice of a conventional narrator in [her] head.&quot;

==Reception==
Critic Stephanie Burt at the &quot;Boston Review&quot; commented: 

==Personal life==
Armantrout graduated from University of California, Berkeley in 1970 and married Chuck Korkegian in 1971, whom she had dated since her first year at the university. Armantrout resides in the Seattle area.

<text>Anne Perry (born Juliet Marion Hulme; 28 October 1938 – 10 April 2023) was a British writer and murderer. She was the author of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt and William Monk series of historical detective fiction. 

In 1994 it became public knowledge that Perry had been convicted of murder in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1954, when she was fifteen. She and her sixteen-year-old friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker&#x27;s mother, Honorah. After serving a five-year sentence for the murder, Perry had changed her name (formerly Juliet Hulme) and returned to the United Kingdom. She was identified by the media following the release of the film &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, directed by Peter Jackson, which is based on the case.

==Early life==
Born in London, the daughter of physicist Henry Rainsford Hulme, Hulme was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean, South Africa, and New Zealand in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. She rejoined her family after her father took a position as rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls&#x27; High School, located in what became the Cranmer Centre. A 1948 &quot;Auckland Star&quot; photograph of Hulme arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff in 2012 and written about in the &quot;Heritage et AL&quot; blog.

==Murder and trial==

In June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker&#x27;s mother, Honorah Rieper. Hulme&#x27;s parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a complicated fantasy life together populated with celebrities such as Mario Lanza and James Mason, did not want to be separated.

On 22 June 1954, the girls and Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in the Port Hills of Christchurch. On an isolated path, Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20.

Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 28 August. As they were too young to be considered for the death penalty under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be &quot;detained at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. They were released separately five years later. At the time of Perry&#x27;s death in 2023, Parker and Perry were not believed to have had any contact since the trial.

The events formed the basis for the 1994 film &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenaged Pauline Parker and Kate Winslet played the teenaged Juliet Hulme. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, it was not generally known that mystery author Anne Perry was Juliet Hulme; her identity was made public after journalists tracked her down some months after the film&#x27;s release. Although some presumed Hulme and Parker&#x27;s relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two &quot;were never lesbians&quot;.

==Later life==
After being released from prison in November 1959, Perry returned to England and became a flight attendant. For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of Portmahomack, where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British hydrogen bomb programme.

Hulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather&#x27;s surname. Her first novel, &quot;The Cater Street Hangman&quot;, was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of genre fiction, including historical murder mysteries and detective fiction. Many feature recurring characters, most importantly Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator William Monk, who first appeared in her 1990 novel &quot;The Face of a Stranger&quot;.

After Perry&#x27;s identity as Hulme was revealed in 1994, she said:
She continued writing and said that she was surprised that her friends stuck by her despite the revelation of her identity and the ensuing media attention. In 1998 she was featured by &quot;The Times&quot; in its list of 100 &quot;masters of crime&quot;. Her story &quot;Heroes&quot;, which first appeared in the 1999 anthology &quot;Murder and Obsession&quot;, edited by Otto Penzler, won the 2000 Edgar Award for Best Short Story.

In 2005, Perry appeared on the &quot;Trisha&quot; show to discuss her murder conviction on a special themed show. A 2009 documentary film, &quot;Anne Perry Interiors&quot;, gave a snapshot of her life and the people close to her. In 2009 she received a lifetime achievement award at the Agatha Awards. In 2013 and 2020 she was a guest of honour at the Bouchercon mystery fiction convention. At the time of her death in 2023, Perry had published 102 books: 32 novels in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, 6 novels in the Daniel Pitt series, 24 novels in the Monk series, five books in her WWI series, five books in her Elena Standish series, four young adult novels, two fantasy novels, and 22 mystery novellas with Christmas themes, as well as a number of essays and short stories. Her UK publisher, Headline, reported that she had sold 25 million copies. Her works regularly appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

In 2017, Perry left Scotland and moved to the US in order to more effectively promote films based on her novels. She had a heart attack in December 2022, and died at a hospital in Los Angeles on 10 April 2023, aged 84. Her novel &quot;The Fourth Enemy&quot;, the sixth Daniel Pitt novel, was published the day after her death.

==Bibliography==
Each series is listed in internal chronological order, according to the author&#x27;s website.

Perry&#x27;s two main series each feature a male and a female protagonist. Thomas Pitt is matched with his wife Charlotte, while William Monk is matched with Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse. The Monk mysteries are set earlier in the Victorian era (1850s–1860s) than the Pitt books (1880s–1890s).

<doc id="396145" wikidata="Q7507794" url="?curid=396145" title="Sid Field">
<text>Sidney Arthur Field (1 April 1904 – 3 February 1950) was an English comedy entertainer who was popular in the 1940s.

==Early years==
Field was born in Ladywood, Birmingham, Warwickshire, the son of Albert (a candlemaker) and Bertha (a dressmaker). Field spent most of his childhood in Birmingham. As a child, he charged his friends &quot;admission&quot; to his back garden impression shows. He also busked and performed in the queues at his local cinema dressed as Charlie Chaplin (once being cautioned by police for his activities). Field was later praised by Chaplin himself, at whose parties Field was a regular invitee.

Field was educated at Conway Road, Stratford Road and Golden Hillock Road schools, and attended Sunday school at Emmanuel Church, Walford Road. His cousins, &quot;the Workmans&quot;, performed in concerts at Moseley Road Swimming Baths in the city, where Field made his stage debut, singing &quot;What A Life&quot; at the age of nine.

His first professional engagement, with &quot;The Kino Royal Juveniles&quot;, came in July 1916, after his mother responded to an advertisement in the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot;. He later worked as an understudy to Wee Georgie Wood in a Birmingham pantomime, then appeared in review at the Bordesley Palace and the Mission Hall in Church Road, Yardley. To assuage the young Sid&#x27;s stage fright, Bertha gave him a glass of port to drink: by the age of 13, he was dependent on alcohol.

==Success==
Sidney Field was considered unusual among comedy performers of the day, as his act was a multitude of characters and impersonations, at a time when most variety (vaudeville) acts were more limited in nature. Despite his flair for comedy and acting, it was not until he had spent decades touring provincial music halls that Field finally achieved prominence, appearing in London&#x27;s West End as &quot;Slasher Green&quot;, the Cockney &quot;wide boy&quot; or &quot;spiv&quot;. His rise to stardom was quick.

In &quot;Strike a New Note&quot; (1943), &quot;Strike it Again&quot; (1944) and &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot; (1946), he had his audiences roaring with laughter. One reviewer commented that he was the only comedian who had the audience literally &quot;falling off their seats with laughter&quot;. He was loved for his routines involving a naïve approach to the billiards table and the golf course, played with his straight man, Jerry Desmonde. Terry-Thomas acted as compere for the shows and appeared with Field in one of the sketches.

On 5 November 1945, Field appeared in the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;. Appearing again in 1946, he became one of the few artists to make an appearance in two consecutive Royal Performances. 18 months later in 1948, Field was topping the bill at the London Palladium, replacing Mickey Rooney.

Field had a starring role in &quot;That&#x27;s the Ticket&quot; (1940) but &quot;London Town&quot; (1946) is often referred to as his first film in error. Some of his best-remembered sketches are preserved here. Field made one more film, &quot;Cardboard Cavalier&quot; (as Sidcup Buttermeadow), co-starring with Margaret Lockwood. However, cinema was not Field&#x27;s most effective medium, and his films were neither critical nor commercial successes.

It is perhaps because of this lack of recorded material on film or TV, that Field is now largely forgotten. Only the three films and some recorded variety material survive. He influenced a generation of comedians and pioneered the use of character acting in comedy. He was cited as a comic favourite by Eric Morecambe, Eric Sykes, Frankie Howerd, Tommy Cooper, among many others, and an influence to Tony Hancock. He was described by Bob Hope as being &#x27;probably the best comedian of them all.&#x27; Laurence Olivier, during an interview with Kenneth Tynan in 1966, cited Field as a strong influence on his acting, saying, &#x27;Of all people I have ever watched with the greatest delight, I think, was in another field entirely, was Sid Field… I still borrow from him, freely and unashamedly.&#x27;

His only straight role came in 1949 in Mary Chase&#x27;s play &quot;Harvey&quot;, (as Elwood P. Dowd, the role played in the 1950 film by James Stewart). Members of the Royal Family went to see the play in August. 

==Personal life, death and legacy==
He married Constance &#x27;Connie&#x27; Dawkins (1910-1992), stage actress, in 1933, Birmingham. They had two daughters and a son. In December 1949 he returned from a cruise on the Durban Castle taken for health reasons. On 3 February 1950, during the run of &quot;Harvey&quot;, Field died from a heart attack at his home, Arran Cottage, Parkside, Wimbledon, London. He was 45. Over 300 people attended his funeral at Putney Vale Crematorium. Later that month, a memorial service was held at London&#x27;s St Martin-in-the-Fields, with lessons read by Laurence Olivier and Ted Ray. A midnight matinée benefit for his wife and children, held on 25 June 1951, was attended by the Duchess of Kent, Aneurin Bevan and Noël Coward. The cast list included Jack Hylton, Bud Flanagan, Arthur Askey, Tommy Trinder, all six of the original Crazy Gang, Peter Ustinov, George Robey and many more, totalling over 240.

There is a Birmingham Civic Society blue plaque commemorating Sid Field on the front of 152 Osborn Road, where he grew up, and a memorial in the foyer of the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, which says:To the memory of the great comedian Sid Field, who made his first appearance in the West End at this theatre on 18 March 1943 and who played his last performance here on 2 February 1950.

In 1994 the actor David Suchet played Sid Field in a stage play of his life (&quot;What a Performance&quot;), and in October 2011, Suchet followed this up as the presenter of a BBC Four documentary about Sid Field. In the programme, Suchet meets stars such as Eric Sykes, Leslie Phillips and Nicholas Parsons who remember Field&#x27;s stage shows.

<doc id="396150" wikidata="Q1392559" url="?curid=396150" title="Iwasawa theory">
<text>In number theory, Iwasawa theory is the study of objects of arithmetic interest over infinite towers of number fields. It began as a Galois module theory of ideal class groups, initiated by (), as part of the theory of cyclotomic fields. In the early 1970s, Barry Mazur considered generalizations of Iwasawa theory to abelian varieties. More recently (early 1990s), Ralph Greenberg has proposed an Iwasawa theory for motives.

==Formulation==
Iwasawa worked with so-called formula_1-extensions: infinite extensions of a number field formula_2 with Galois group formula_3 isomorphic to the additive group of p-adic integers for some prime &quot;p&quot;. (These were called formula_4-extensions in early papers.) Every closed subgroup of formula_4 is of the form formula_6 so by Galois theory, a formula_1-extension formula_8 is the same thing as a tower of fields

:formula_9

such that formula_10 Iwasawa studied classical Galois modules over formula_11 by asking questions about the structure of modules over formula_12

More generally, Iwasawa theory asks questions about the structure of Galois modules over extensions with Galois group a p-adic Lie group.

==Example==
Let formula_13 be a prime number and let formula_14 be the field generated over formula_15 by the formula_13th roots of unity. Iwasawa considered the following tower of number fields:

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the field generated by adjoining to formula_19 the &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1-st roots of unity and

:formula_20

The fact that formula_21 implies, by infinite Galois theory, that formula_22 In order to get an interesting Galois module, Iwasawa took the ideal class group of formula_18, and let formula_24 be its &quot;p&quot;-torsion part. There are norm maps formula_25 whenever formula_26, and this gives us the data of an inverse system. If we set

:formula_27

then it is not hard to see from the inverse limit construction that formula_28 is a module over formula_29 In fact, formula_30 is a module over the Iwasawa algebra formula_31. This is a 2-dimensional, regular local ring, and this makes it possible to describe modules over it. From this description it is possible to recover information about the &quot;p&quot;-part of the class group of formula_32

The motivation here is that the &quot;p&quot;-torsion in the ideal class group of formula_19 had already been identified by Kummer as the main obstruction to the direct proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

==Connections with p-adic analysis==
From this beginning in the 1950s, a substantial theory has been built up. A fundamental connection was noticed between the module theory, and the p-adic L-functions that were defined in the 1960s by Kubota and Leopoldt. The latter begin from the Bernoulli numbers, and use interpolation to define p-adic analogues of the Dirichlet L-functions. It became clear that the theory had prospects of moving ahead finally from Kummer&#x27;s century-old results on regular primes.

Iwasawa formulated the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory as an assertion that two methods of defining p-adic L-functions (by module theory, by interpolation) should coincide, as far as that was well-defined. This was proved by for formula_15 and for all totally real number fields by . These proofs were modeled upon Ken Ribet&#x27;s proof of the converse to Herbrand&#x27;s theorem (the so-called Herbrand–Ribet theorem).

Karl Rubin found a more elementary proof of the Mazur-Wiles theorem by using Kolyvagin&#x27;s Euler systems, described in and , and later proved other generalizations of the main conjecture for imaginary quadratic fields.

==Generalizations==
The Galois group of the infinite tower, the starting field, and the sort of arithmetic module studied can all be varied. In each case, there is a &quot;main conjecture&quot; linking the tower to a &quot;p&quot;-adic L-function.

In 2002, Christopher Skinner and Eric Urban claimed a proof of a &quot;main conjecture&quot; for GL(2). In 2010, they posted a preprint .

<text>Dev Anand (born Dharamdev Pishorimal Anand; 26 September 1923 – 3 December 2011) was an Indian actor, writer, director and producer known for his work in Hindi cinema. Anand is considered as one of the greatest and most successful actors in the history of Indian cinema. Through a career that spanned over six decades, he worked in more than 100 films. Anand is a recipient of four Filmfare Awards, including two for Best Actor. The Government of India honoured him with Padma Bhushan, Indian third highest civilian honour in 2001 and with Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2002.

In 1946, Anand debuted with a lead role in Prabhat Films&#x27;s &quot; Hum Ek Hain&quot;, a film about Hindu-Muslim unity. He had his first commercial success in &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1948) and gained widespread recognition with the blockbuster crime thriller &quot;Baazi&quot; (1951), which is regarded as the forerunner of the spate of &quot;Bombay Noir&quot; films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. In later years, he starred in top grossing films, such as &quot;Jaal&quot; (1952), &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1954), &quot;Insaniyat&quot; (1955), &quot;Munimji&quot; (1955), &quot;C.I.D.&quot; (1956), &quot;Paying Guest&quot; (1957), &quot;Kala Pani&quot; (1958) and &quot;Kala Bazar&quot; (1960). Anand acquired a romantic image with films such as &quot;Manzil&quot; (1960), &quot;Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai&quot; (1961), &quot;Hum Dono&quot; (1961), &quot;Asli-Naqli&quot; (1962) and &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Samne&quot; (1963).

The 1965 film &quot;Guide&quot; marked a major milestone in Anand&#x27;s career. Based on the novel by R. K. Narayan, it became a box office success; and was entered for Best Foreign Language Film at the 38th Academy Awards. He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967), based on the thriller genre, it went on to become a hit at the box office. In the 70s, he forayed into direction with espionage drama &quot;Prem Pujari&quot;. Throughout the 70s and 80s, he starred in a number of highly successful films, including (1970), which was highest grosser of the year, &quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot; (1971), &quot;Banarasi Babu&quot; (1973), &quot;Heera Panna&quot; (1973), &quot;Amir Garib&quot; (1974), &quot;Warrant&quot; (1975), &quot;Des Pardes&quot; (1978), &quot;Swami Dada&quot; (1982) and &quot;Lashkar&quot; (1989). The 2011 film &quot;Chargesheet&quot; was Anand&#x27;s final film.

Anand&#x27;s fast dialogue delivery and unique nodding style became the trademarks of his acting in movies. His style was often copied by other actors. Many of Dev Anand&#x27;s films explored his cultural viewpoint of the world and often highlighted many socially relevant topics. Anand won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the films &quot;Kala Pani&quot; and &quot;Guide&quot;. Anand was married to actress Kalpana Kartik, with whom he had two children, including Suneil Anand.

==Early life and family==
Anand was born Dharamdev Pishorimal Anand on 26 September 1923 in the Shakargarh tehsil of the Gurdaspur district in Punjab, British India (now Narowal District, Punjab, Pakistan). 

His father Pishori Lal Anand was a prominent lawyer in Gurdaspur District Court. Pishori Lal Anand was also a freedom fighter and scholar affiliated with the Arya Samaj organization, who would study world religions in different languages (the Bhagavad-Gita in Sanskrit, the Bible in Hebrew, the Qur&#x27;an in Arabic while he also knew Persian). 

Dev was the third of four sons born to Pishori Lal Anand. One of Dev&#x27;s younger sisters Sheel Kanta Kapur, is the mother of film director Shekhar Kapur. His older brothers included Manmohan Anand (Advocate, Gurdaspur Dist. Court) and Chetan Anand, while Vijay Anand was his younger brother.

Anand did his schooling till matriculation from Sacred Heart School, Dalhousie (then in Punjab), and went to Government College Dharamshala before going to Lahore to study. Later Dev completed a B.A. degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore in British India. Part of the Anand family, he co-founded Navketan Films in 1949 with his elder brother Chetan Anand.

==Career==
After completing his BA degree in English literature from the Government College, Lahore (then in British India). Anand left his hometown for Bombay in the early 1940s. He began his career in the military censor&#x27;s office at Churchgate, for a monthly salary of Rs. 65. Later, he worked as a clerk in an accounting firm for a salary of Rs. 85. He joined his older brother, Chetan, as a member of the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association (IPTA). Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar&#x27;s performance in films such as &quot;Achhut Kanya&quot; and &quot;Kismet&quot;. Anand quoted in an interview that &quot;I remember when I gate-crashed into the office of the man who gave me the first break, he kept looking at me – Babu Rao Pai of Prabhat Film Studios. At that time he made up his mind that this boy deserves a break and later mentioned to his people that &#x27;this boy struck me because of his smile and beautiful eyes and his tremendous confidence.&#x27;&quot; Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films&#x27; &quot;Hum Ek Hain&quot; (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them were to become successful in the film industry, he would help the other also to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it.

===Late 1940s breakthrough and romance with Suraiya===
In the late 1940s, Anand was offered a few roles starring as the male lead opposite singer-actress Suraiya in woman-oriented films. While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The two of them were paired in many films: &quot;Vidya&quot; (1948), &quot;Jeet&quot; (1949), (1949), (1950), &quot;Nili&quot; (1950), &quot;Sanam&quot; and &quot;Do Sitare&quot; (1951). In these films, Suraiya was always the first biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song &quot;Kinare Kinare Chale Jayen Ge&quot; from the film &quot;Vidya&quot;— while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Initially, Suraiya&#x27;s family used to welcome Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the set of &quot;Jeet&quot;, she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who went out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. During the shooting of the film (1950), Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, so, Suraiya remained unmarried. They stopped acting together after her grandmother opposed their partnership, and &quot;Do Sitare&quot; was the last film in which they appeared together. Although the films he starred in with Suraiya had been successful, the producers and directors of those films attributed their success to the acting prowess and screen presence of Suraiya. Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities.

Dev Anand often spoke about Suraiya and his love affair with her, in various interviews, he gave to film magazines, such as &quot;Stardust&quot; (June 1972 issue), &quot;Star &amp; Style&quot; (Feb 1987 issue) and TV to Karan Thapar for BBC (2002), while both were alive and after Suraiya&#x27;s death in interviews given on TV to Simi Garewal (&quot;Rendezvous with Simi Garewal&quot;) and others on TV and for news magazines.

===Breakthrough and 1950s stardom===
Anand was offered his first big break by Ashok Kumar. He spotted Anand hanging around in the studios and picked him as the hero for the Bombay Talkies production &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1948), co-starring Kamini Kaushal, which became an instant success. After &quot;Ziddi&quot;″s success, Anand decided that he would start producing films. It was in the film &quot;Ziddi&quot;, that the first ever Kishore-Lata duet, &quot;Yeh Kaun Aaya Karke Yeh Sola Singhar&quot;, was recorded. This duet was an instant hit, and from here on both playback singers&#x27; associations with Dev Anand began. This continued for the next four decades. His association with Kishore Kumar started when the former sang the first solo of his playback singing career – &quot;Marne Ki Duayen&quot; – picturised on Dev Anand in the movie &quot;Ziddi&quot;. Dev had forged a very strong bond of friendship with Kishore Kumar during the making of the film. In 1949, he launched his own company &quot;Navketan Films&quot; (named after his elder brother Chetan&#x27;s son Ketan and which means &quot;New Banner&quot;), which, as of 2011, has produced 35 films. &quot;Nirala&quot; (1950), a commercial success, saw him being paired opposite Madhubala for the first time, with whom he would later form a popular pair.

Dev chose Guru Dutt as director for the crime thriller, &quot;Baazi&quot; (1951). The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali, and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of urban crime films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film &quot;Baazi&quot; saw the debut of Kalpana Kartik (aka Mona Singha) as the lead female actress and Guru Dutt as a director. The collaboration was a success at the box office and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies &quot;Aandhiyan&quot; (1952), &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1954), &quot;House No. 44&quot; (1955) and &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; (1957) went on to become big hits too. During the making of the film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, Suneil Anand in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born. After her marriage, Kalpana decided not to pursue her acting career further. &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; was the couple&#x27;s last movie together.

A rapid-fire style of dialogue delivery and a penchant for nodding while speaking became Dev&#x27;s style in films such as &quot;Baazi&quot; (1951), &quot;Jaal&quot; (1952), &quot;House No. 44&quot; (1955), &quot;Pocket Maar&quot; (1956), &quot;Munimji&quot; (1955), &quot;Funtoosh&quot; (1956), &quot;C.I.D.&quot; (1956) and &quot;Paying Guest&quot; (1957). In the 1950s his films were of the mystery genre or light comedy love stories or were films with social relevance such as &quot;Ek Ke Baad Ek&quot; (1959) and &quot;Funtoosh&quot; (1956). His style was lapped up by the audience and was widely imitated. He starred in a string of box office successes for the remainder of the 1950s opposite newcomer Waheeda Rehman in &quot;C.I.D.&quot; (1956), &quot;Solva Saal&quot; (1958), &quot;Kala Bazar&quot; (1960) and &quot;Baat Ek Raat Ki&quot; (1962). Waheeda first became a star when &quot;C.I.D&quot; became a hit. In 1955, he co-starred with Dilip Kumar in the blockbuster actioner &quot;Insaniyat&quot;. With his acting in the box office success &quot;Kala Pani&quot; (1958) opposite Madhubala and Nalini Jaywant, as the son who is willing to go to any lengths to clear his framed father&#x27;s name, he won his first Filmfare award for Best Actor for the film. He attempted films of tragic genre occasionally, such as &quot;Pocket Maar&quot; (1956), &quot;Kala Pani&quot; (1958), &quot;Bombai Ka Baboo&quot; (1960) and &quot;Sharabi&quot; (1964) and tasted success with them. Dev also played a few characters with a negative shade, as in &quot;Jaal&quot; (1952) where he played a smuggler, then as an absconding gang member in &quot;Dushman&quot; (1957), and as a black marketer in &quot;Kala Bazar&quot;. Apart from his pairing with Suraiya and Kalpana Kartik, his pairing with Nutan, Waheeda Rehman and Geeta Bali was popular among the audiences in the late 50s and 60s. His films &quot;Rahi&quot; (1952) and &quot;Aandhiyan&quot; (1952), were screened along with Raj Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Awaara&quot;. From the early fifties till the mid-sixties, the trio of actors Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, and Anand ruled the roost.

===Romantic hero image in the 1960s===
In the sixties, Dev Anand acquired a romantic image with films such as &quot;Manzil&quot; and &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Samne&quot; with Nutan, &quot;Kinare Kinare&quot; with Meena Kumari, &quot;Maya&quot; with Mala Sinha, &quot;Asli-Naqli&quot; with Sadhana Shivdasani, &quot;Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai&quot;, &quot;Mahal&quot; with Asha Parekh and &quot;Teen Deviyaan&quot; opposite three heroines Kalpana, Simi Garewal and Nanda. In the film &quot;Teen Deviyaan&quot;, Dev Anand played a playboy. One of his notable films of the early sixties was &quot;Hum Dono&quot; (1961) which he produced and acted in, as Anand, a young lover who joins the army in frustration over being shunned by the father of his love Meeta (played by Sadhana Shivdasani). Anand played a double role in the film, also acting as Major Varma, his look-alike who he runs into in the army and forms a deep friendship. Notable for its music by Jaidev, the film was a box office hit.
His first colour film, &quot;Guide&quot; with Waheeda Rehman was based on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand tapped his friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English simultaneously and was released in 1965. &quot;Guide&quot;, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame, and salvation.

He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967), based on the thriller genre which featured Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja, Anju Mahendru, Faryal and Helen and was very successful. Their next collaboration, (1970), again a thriller, in which Dev was paired opposite Hema Malini was a huge blockbuster. It was &quot;Johnny Mera Naam&quot; which made Hema Malini a big star.

In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.

===Directorial debut and versatility in the 1970s===
Dev Anand&#x27;s directorial debut, the espionage drama &quot;Prem Pujari&quot;, was a flop but has developed a cult following over the years. The film introduced Zaheeda and had Waheeda Rehman as the female lead. He tasted success with his 1971 directorial effort &quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot;, shot primarily in Nepal around Swyambhunath, and Bhaktapur, in which talks about the prevalent hippie culture. His find Zeenat Aman, who played the mini-skirt-sporting, pot-smoking Janice, became an overnight sensation. Anand also became known as a filmmaker of trenchantly topical themes. The same year, he starred with Mumtaz in &quot;Tere Mere Sapne&quot;, an adaptation of A. J. Cronin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Citadel&quot;. The film was directed by Dev&#x27;s brother, Vijay, and was also successful. In 1971 he paired again with Zaheeda in &quot;Gambler&quot; which went on to become a success.

In the 1970s, Raj Kapoor started playing roles of father in films such as &quot;Kal Aaj Aur Kal&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Dharam Karam&quot; in 1974 and had put on a lot of weight and films with Dilip Kumar as a lead hero like &quot;Dastaan&quot; and &quot;Bairaag&quot; were failures at the box office. Some of the hurriedly made films with Dev Anand as the leading man—two each opposite Hema Malini – &quot;Shareef Badmaash&quot;, &quot;Joshila&quot; and two with Zeenat Aman – &quot;Ishk Ishk Ishk&quot;, &quot;Prem Shastra&quot; and &quot;Saheb Bahadur&quot; with Priya Rajvansh — became flops and posed a threat to his career as a leading man. He bounced back with the double-role film &quot;Banarasi Babu&quot; in 1973. He delivered commercial hits again with young heroines like with Sharmila Tagore in &quot;Yeh Gulistan Hamara&quot; (1972), with Yogeeta Bali and Raakhee in &quot;Banarasi Babu&quot; (1973), with Hema Malini in &quot;Chhupa Rustam&quot; (1973) and &quot;Amir Garib&quot; (1974), with Zeenat Aman in &quot;Heera Panna&quot; (1973), &quot;Warrant&quot; (1975), &quot;Kalabaaz&quot; (1977) and &quot;Darling Darling&quot; (1977) and with Parveen Babi in &quot;Bullet&quot; (1976). The presence of his discoveries in the 1970s—Zeenat, and later Tina Munim, in films and his good on-screen chemistry with beautiful young stars such as Raakhee, Parveen Babi, Hema Malini and Zeenat Aman in various films boosted Anand&#x27;s image as the evergreen star even though he was well into his fifties. He attempted different genres of films to acquire versatile hero images. He was already 55 when he was paired with Tina Munim in 1978 in &quot;Des Pardes&quot;, which became among the top five-grossing films of the year.

===Political activism during the Emergency in the late 1970s===
Dev Anand has also been politically active. He led a group of film personalities who stood up against the Internal Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. He actively campaigned against her with his supporters in the Indian parliamentary elections in 1977. He also formed a party called the &quot;National Party of India&quot;, which he later disbanded.

===Later career and an evergreen hero===
The 1978 hit &quot;Des Pardes&quot;, directed by Dev Anand was the debut movie of actress Tina Munim and this film&#x27;s success gave him the tag of the &quot;Evergreen Star&quot;. Dev Anand was offered the lead role in &quot;Man Pasand&quot; by director Basu Chatterjee. Dev Anand&#x27;s successful run at the box office continued in the 1980s with &quot;Man Pasand&quot;, &quot;Lootmaar&quot; (both opposite Tina Munim), and &quot;Swami Dada&quot; (1982), all being critically acclaimed and box office hits.

Though Dev Anand&#x27;s demand as the lead hero had not decreased even in the 1980s, he decided that it was the right time to introduce his son Suneil Anand in films as the hero. He launched his son in the &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;-inspired &quot;Anand Aur Anand&quot; (1984), which was produced and directed by Dev Anand himself and had music by R.D. Burman. He expected the film to do well, but the film was a box office disaster, and Suneil Anand decided not to act in films any more.

But films with Dev Anand as the lead hero in &quot;Hum Naujawan&quot; (1985) and &quot;Lashkar&quot; (1989) continued to be box office successes and were appreciated by critics. He was already 60 years old in 1983 when he acted opposite Christine O&#x27;Neil and alongside Rati Agnihotri and Padmini Kolhapure in &quot;Swami Dada&quot;. In 1989, his directorial venture &quot;Sachche ka Bolbala&quot; was released. Though critically acclaimed, it was a commercial failure. His performance as Professor Anand in the 1989 film &quot;Lashkar&quot; was widely appreciated and was a major success at the box office. &quot;Lashkar&quot; was his last hit film in the lead role in 1989, with him neither producer nor director of the film.

He directed &quot;Pyar Ka Tarana&quot; in 1993, without casting himself in any role. His directorial movie &quot;Gangster&quot; (1995) had a controversial nude rape scene and the movie was released uncut. He received offers to star in the lead roles outside of his home banners in films like &quot;Return of Jewel Thief&quot; and &quot;Aman Ke Farishtey&quot; but the former was not successful at the box office and the latter wasn&#x27;t released in 1993 though the film was fully ready to be released.

Since 1992, seven of his directorial ventures were box office failures. His last film &quot;Chargesheet&quot; (2011) was panned by critics across the board and was a box office flop.

He also starred in English films such as The &quot;Evil Within&quot; (1970), where he was paired opposite Vietnamese actress Kieu Chinh and Zeenat Aman and &quot;Guide&quot; (English Version). The English language film &quot;The Evil Within&quot; was a 20th-Century Fox production that couldn&#x27;t get the nod from the concerned authorities due to its parallel track dealing with opium selling and thus the Indian viewers were deprived of this American venture. Of the 114 Hindi films, he appeared in, over 6 decades, &quot;Kahin Aur Chal&quot; (1968) had a delayed release in the early 1970s and the multi-starrer film &quot;Ek Do Teen Chaar&quot; (1980) remained unreleased and &quot;Shrimanji&quot; (1968) had him in a guest appearance. By 2011, he had the second most solo lead roles in Hindi films— 92, with Rajesh Khanna having the record for the most films as the solo lead hero in Hindi films – 106.

== Production ==
Dev Anand has produced 35 films. Of the 35 films he produced, 18 were commercially successful at the box office. He wrote the stories for 13 of his films. Anand&#x27;s films are well known for their hit songs. He is known to have been an active participant in the music sessions of a number of his films. His association with music composers Shankar-Jaikishen, O. P. Nayyar, Kalyanji-Anandji, Sachin Dev Burman and his son Rahul Dev Burman, lyricists Hasrat Jaipuri, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Gopaldas Neeraj, Shailendra, Anand Bakshi, and playback singers Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi and Hemant Kumar produced some very popular songs. Guru Dutt, Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi, Pran, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Sunil Dutt, Nargis, Vyjayanthimala, S.D. Burman, Shammi Kapoor and R.D. Burman were his closest friends from the film industry.

Anand is credited with giving actors such as Zarina Wahab in &quot;Ishk Ishk Ishk&quot; (1974), Jackie Shroff in &quot;Swami Dada&quot; (1982), Tabu in &quot;Hum Naujawan&quot; (1985) and Richa Sharma (Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s first wife) a break in the film industry, discovering Zeenat Amaan, Tina Munim and encouraging music composer Rajesh Roshan. Amit Khanna started his career with Navketan as executive producer in 1971 and had been secretary to Dev Anand in the 1970s. He adds, &quot;The uniqueness of Navketan today is that it&#x27;s the only film company in the world still run by the one who started it.&quot; Shatrughan Sinha disclosed in an interview that it was Dev Anand who gave him a break in films by giving him a role in &quot;Prem Pujari&quot; and since Dev had given Sinha a very small role in that film, he compensated for it by giving Sinha another role in his next film &quot;Gambler&quot;. Sinha quoted: &quot;Later on we worked together in &quot;Sharif Badmash&quot; and it was really a privilege to work with him&quot;. It was under Dev Anand&#x27;s Navketan Banner where Guru Dutt, Raj Khosla, Waheeda Rehman, S.D. Burman, Jaidev, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Yash Johar, Shekhar Kapur and Kabir Bedi were given breaks into Hindi films and Dev launched actors Zaheera, Zaheeda Hussain, Zarina Wahab, Natasha Sinha, Ekta Sohini and Sabrina.

== Personal life ==
Anand was in a relationship with actress Suraiya for four years from 1948 to 1951. Anand nicknamed Suraiya &quot;Nosey&quot;, while to Suraiya, Dev Anand was &quot;Steve&quot;, a name chosen from a book Dev Anand had given her. Suraiya also called Anand &quot;Devina&quot; and he called her &quot;Suraiyana&quot;, while faking an Italian accent. During the shooting of &quot;Jeet&quot; (1949), both Anand and Suraiya, had made plans for marriage and elopement, but were unsuccessful due to the opposition from Suraiya&#x27;s maternal grandmother and maternal uncle. In the &#x27;Star and Style&#x27; interview, Suraiya said that she gave in only when both her grandmother and her maternal uncle threatened to get Dev Anand killed. Suraiya and Anand were stopped from acting together after their last film in 1951 by her grandmother. In an interview with &quot;Stardust&quot;, in June 1972, Suraiya revealed that she lacked the courage to resist her family and that Anand truly loved her. Anand wanted her to be bold and marry him in a civil court, but she refused. Suraiya remained unmarried throughout her life till she died on 31 January 2004. In his auto-biography, Anand said Suraiya was his &quot;first true love&quot;. When Suraiya died in 2004, Anand hid from the media in his terrace, because he wanted to be away from the media.

Dev Anand was broken after the relationship ended. In 1954, Anand married Kalpana Kartik, an actress from Shimla, in a private marriage during the shooting of the film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. They have two children, son Suneil Anand, born 1956 and daughter Devina Anand.

== Public image ==
Anand is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema. Anand is noted for his diverse roles and charm. One of the highest paid actor from the 1950s to early 1970s, Anand appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actors&quot; list sixteen times, (1948, 1951–1963, 1970–1971). In 2022, he was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actors&quot; list. Anand was placed seventh among the &quot;Greatest Bollywood Stars&quot; in a UK poll celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema, in 2013. He was also a part of the &quot;Trinity – The Golden Trio&quot; (along with Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar). In 2013, he was named as one of &quot;the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema&quot; by &quot;CNN-News18&quot;.

Anand was widely known as the &quot;first fashion icon&quot; of Bollywood. He made fashion statement with his scarves, mufflers and jackets and his signature puff. Many film actors and fashion designers have taken inspiration from Anand. &quot;Filmfare&quot; place him third in its &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s most stylish men&quot; list. Commenting on his style, Rachel Dwyer said, &quot;Dev Anand’s offscreen persona was that of the modern Indian citizen created by the new state of India. Onscreen, he often appeared as himself from film to film, with his distinctive hair puff and stylish western clothes – the look was often similar, well-suited to an urban and urbane hero, he played a wide variety of roles convincingly.&quot; After the film &quot;Kaala Paani&quot;, there was a period when Anand did not wear black in public. In September 2007, Dev Anand&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Romancing with Life&quot; was released at a birthday party with the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh.

== Artistry and legacy ==
=== Acting style and reception ===
Anand is considered to be among the finest and greatest actor in Indian cinema. Anand played the leading man from 1940s till the 1980s and was known for his strong roles. He is noted for playing roles in diverse genres — from romantic dramas to actions to thrillers to musical dramas. Anupama Chopra termed Anand the &quot;most dashing hero&quot;, Indian cinema has ever seen and added, &quot;The nodding head, flopping arms, casual charm inspired a legion of actors. Yet, in 77 years, Dev Saab hasn’t had a true successor.&quot; Although Anand was mainly a romantic actor, but he also played complicated, compromised characters. Anand&#x27;s film &quot;Baazi&quot; is regarded as the forerunner of the spate of &quot;Bombay Noir&quot;. He later appeared in many thrillers like &quot;C.I.D&quot;, &quot;Kala Pani&quot;, &quot;Jaal&quot;, &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; and &quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot;. On this, filmmaker Sriram Raghavan said, &quot;Much before Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, much more than Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor, it was Dev Anand’s bold film choices that shaped what is called the Bombay noir.&quot;

Devesh Sharma of &quot;Filmfare&quot; termed him a &quot;debonair hero&quot; and noted, &quot;His true matinee idol good looks, suave demeanour and charismatic screen presence made his fans swoon every time he came on screen.&quot; Subhash K. Jha of &quot;Firstpost&quot; called him the &quot;most easygoing superstar cinema has ever known&quot; and said, &quot;Dev Anand symbolized the most dazzling bastion of Hindi cinema. He was flamboyant, debonair, mischievous and romantic.&quot; Shekhar Gupta of &quot;The Print&quot; said, &quot;Nobody could match Dev Anand for style.&quot; He added, &quot;Many of his films were ahead of his time. But you always walked out of the sultry small-town hall copying Dev Anand’s leaning-tower gait, his mannerism, and always hummed his songs.&quot; Journalist Rauf Ahmed added Anand on his &quot;Biggest stars in Hindi filmdom&quot; list and noted, &quot;For almost five decades Anand has continued to fascinate his fans with his never-say-die spirit and flamboyance. He is one actor for whom time has had the courtesy to stand still.&quot; Saibal Chatterjee of &quot;The Tribune&quot; noted, &quot;There is nobody quite like Dev Anand. A timeless Bollywood icon, an eternal dreamer and a man of action, his creative life has never known anything akin to a full stop.&quot; Siddharth Bhatia said, &quot;Anand&#x27;s various roles – whether in the black-and-white 1950s, when he usually played a down-at-heel cabbie or con artist, or in the 1960s when he matured, and even later – were all marked with a can-do spirit; maudlin self-pity was not his style.&quot;

===Comparison with Gregory Peck===
Anand was often compared to the famous Hollywood actor Gregory Peck. Anand said that he didn&#x27;t feel ecstatic hearing the tagline bestowed on him in his heyday. &quot;When you are at an impressionable age you make idols, but when you grow out of the phase, you develop your own persona. I don&#x27;t want to be known as India&#x27;s Gregory Peck, I am Dev Anand&quot;. Acquainted with the Bollywood actor, Peck&#x27;s personal interactions with him spanned four to five long meetings in Europe and Mumbai.

Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for the first time at Bombay&#x27;s Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954. He knew of the &quot;Indian Star&quot; as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, and they exchanged pleasantries. The third meeting was in London on the set of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn&#x27;t mind that he was not invited. &quot;I didn&#x27;t quite feel anything. It wasn&#x27;t as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn&#x27;t my rival. I too was a big star by then,&quot; says Anand.

==Death==
Dev Anand died in his room at The Washington Mayfair Hotel in London at age of 88 on 3 December 2011 of a cardiac arrest. His death came just two months after the release of his last film &quot;Chargesheet&quot;, which he directed and produced. Anand was reportedly in London for a medical checkup at the time of his death. On 10 December, his funeral service was held at a small chapel in London after which his coffin was taken to the Putney Vale Crematorium in southwest London. His ashes were returned to India for immersion burial in the Godavari River.

<text>Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde (12 February 1873, Leeuwarden – 27 April 1937 near Locarno in a plane crash) was a Dutch physician and gynæcologist who served as director at the Gynæcological Institute in Haarlem.

==Biography==
His 1926 book &quot;Het volkomen huwelijk&quot; (&quot;The Perfect Marriage&quot;) made him an instant international celebrity. The book advocated knowledge and sensuality in erotic life. In Germany, &quot;Die vollkommene Ehe&quot; reached its 42nd printing in 1932, in spite of the fact that it was placed on the list of forbidden books, Index Librorum Prohibitorum, by the Roman Catholic Church.

German-American sex therapist and Holocaust survivor Dr. Ruth Westheimer, known popularly as Dr. Ruth, has said that it was the first book on the subject of sex that she ever had an opportunity to read a few pages of, when she was a ten-year-old child in Frankfurt, Germany.

In Protestant and social democratic Sweden, &quot;Det fulländade äktenskapet&quot; was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. The English translation, &quot;Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique&quot;, was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition, selling well over a half million copies.

He is credited with showing in 1905 that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle. This contributed to the improvement of calendar-based methods of birth control, and later to the creation of other fertility awareness systems.

Wilhelm Reich mentions Van de Velde in his 1945 essay Listen, Little Man! (German: &quot;Rede an den kleinen Mann&quot;): &quot;You say: &#x27;Sexuality is a petit-bourgeois invention, it&#x27;s the economic factors that count&#x27;. And you read Van de Velde&#x27;s book on love technique.&quot; (1948 English translation by Theodore Peter Wolfe, Penguin books edition 1975, page 38).

<text>Hochfilzen is a town and municipality in the Kitzbühel district of the Austrian state of Tyrol. It is located in the Pillersee valley 5 km east of Fieberbrunn. Population was 1,147 in 2016.

It is a popular winter sports resort, especially for cross-country skiing. In 2017 (9 to 19 February) it hosted the Biathlon World Championships, as it also did in 2005, 1998 and 1978, and it is a regular venue in the annual IBU World Cup series.

== Training area ==
In 1875 Hochfilzen was joined to the railway network and soon afterwards a military training area was established here. The training area is used today by the Austrian Bundesheer as an army sports centre for biathlon as well as survival training by the Jagdkommando. The training area was once one of the scenes in the Lucona Scandal, which shook Austrian politics at the end of the 1970s.

<text> (; &quot;The National Encyclopedia&quot; in English), abbreviated NE, is a comprehensive contemporary Swedish-language encyclopedia with several hundred thousand articles. It is available both online and via a printed version.

==History==
The project was initiated in 1980 when a government committee suggested that negotiations be initiated with various publishers. A loan from the Government of Sweden of 17 million Swedish krona, which was repaid by December 1990, provided funding.

In August 1985, in Höganäs became the publisher responsible for the project. The project specifications were for a modern reference work based on a scientific paradigm incorporating gender and environmental issues.

Pre-orders for the work were unprecedented; before the first volume was published in December 1989, 54,000 customers had ordered the encyclopedia. The last volume came out in 1996, with three supplemental volumes in 2000. 160,000 copies had been sold as of 2004.

Associated with the project are also:
*&quot;NE:s Ordbok&quot;, a dictionary in three volumes (1995–1996)
*&quot;NE:s Årsband&quot;, complementary volumes concerning current events and fast changing information distributed annually since 1997
*&quot;NE:s Sverigeatlas&quot;, an atlas of Sweden (1998)
*&quot;NE:s Världsatlas&quot;, a world atlas (1998)
*&quot;NE-spelet&quot;, a quiz game with 8,000 questions (1999)

In 1997, the first digital form of the encyclopedia was released on six CD-ROMs (later on DVD as well), and in 2000 as an Internet subscription service. The online version contains the dictionary as well as an updated version of the original encyclopedia. It has 356,000 entries, 183,000 of which are encyclopedic articles. The service has been completed with several features not available in the printed version, such as a Swedish–English dictionary.

In 2018, after a decision to remove the authors&#x27; names from the byline of online articles, &quot;SVT&quot; reported the encyclopedia may be forced to remove thousands of articles due to copyright infringement unless the authors&#x27; names are added back.

The story centers around Akaash, a young man from the slums of Bombay who dreams of becoming the next big star in Bollywood. Fate steps in when a rich lawyer and his fiancée, an aspiring documentary filmmaker, arrive to prevent the demolition of Akaash&#x27;s slum. Akaash quickly falls in love with the lawyer&#x27;s fiancée, Priya, who happens to be the daughter of a famous Bollywood director.

<text>Lake Lahontan was a large endorheic prehistoric lake during the Pleistocene that occupied modern northwestern Nevada and extended into northeastern California and southern Oregon. The area of the former lake is a large portion of the Great Basin that borders the Sacramento River watershed to the west.

The lake was named by Clarence King during the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel. The name honors Louis-Armand de Lom d&#x27;Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan, a French soldier and explorer.

==History==

At its peak approximately 12,700 years ago (during a period known as the Sehoo Highstand), the lake had a surface area of over , with its largest component centered at the location of the present Carson Sink. Near present day Pyramid Lake the depth of the lake was then about and at what is present day Black Rock Desert. Lake Lahontan, during this most recent glacial period, would have been one of the largest lakes in North America.

Climate change around the end of the Pleistocene epoch led to a gradual desiccation of ancient Lake Lahontan. The lake had largely disappeared in its extended form by about 9,000 years ago. As the surface elevation dropped, the lake broke up into series of smaller lakes, most of which rapidly dried up, leaving only a playa. These playas include the Black Rock Desert, the Carson Sink, and the Humboldt Sink. The only modern remnants existing as true lakes are Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake. Winnemucca Lake has been dry since the 1930s and Honey Lake periodically desiccates. The ancient shoreline is evidenced by tufa formations throughout the area.

Surprisingly, the watershed feeding Lake Lahontan is not thought to have been significantly wetter during its highstand than it is currently. Rather, its desiccation is thought to be mostly due to increase in the evaporation rate as the climate warmed. Recent computer simulations (using the DSSAM Model and other techniques) indicate, if precipitation and evaporation rates within the watershed were maintained at their historical yearly maximum and minimum, respectively, and if diversions of the Truckee River ceased, the Ice Age extent of Lake Lahontan might return. 

Archaeological evidence along the shore indicates the existence of the lake coincided roughly with the first appearance of humans in the region. The Lahontan cutthroat trout evolved as a predator species within the waters of Lake Lahontan, feeding on native chub and sucker. This subspecies of cutthroat trout survives today in tributary rivers of the Great Basin, and has been reintroduced to Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake after being extirpated during the 20th century.

<doc id="396203" wikidata="Q13420" url="?curid=396203" title="Beta Canis Minoris">
<text>Beta Canis Minoris (β Canis Minoris, abbreviated Beta CMi, β CMi), also named Gomeisa , is a star in the constellation of Canis Minor. In the night sky it is notable for its proximity to the prominent star Procyon.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;β Canis Minoris&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Canis Minoris&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The traditional name &quot;Gomeisa&quot; comes from the Arabic &quot;al-ghumaisa&#x27;&quot; (&quot;the bleary-eyed (woman)&quot;), short for مرزم الغميصاء &quot;mirzam al-ghumaisa&#x27;&quot; (&quot;girdle of the bleary-eyed one&quot;). In Arabic, the short form would be identical with the name of Procyon. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Gomeisa&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;South River&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of β Canis Minoris, Procyon and Epsilon Canis Minoris. Consequently, β Canis Minoris itself is known as (, ).

==Properties==
From parallax measurements, the distance to this star is about . It has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.89, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Beta Canis Minoris has about 3.5 times the Sun&#x27;s mass and is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of , which gives a lower bound on the azimuthal rotational velocity along the star&#x27;s equator. The actual rotation rate may be about once per day.

The stellar classification of this star is B8 Ve. A luminosity class V star belongs on the main sequence, which means it is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The star is radiating this energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of , giving it a blue-white hue typical of B-type stars. An &#x27;e&#x27; classification indicates that the spectrum contains emission lines, which means this is a Be star that is surrounded by a thin, circumstellar disk made of gaseous material ejected from the star. This hot, gaseous disk is about three times the radius of the star.

==Variability==

β Canis Minoris has long been suspected of variability, and in 1977 it was classified as a γ Cassiopeiae variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. A number of studies have found no variation at all. While it shows little variation in brightness, it does display changes in the hydrogen emission coming from the gaseous disk but even those are less pronounced than in many other Be stars.

Examination with the Canadian MOST space telescope reveals changes in the brightness of β Canis Minoris at the milli-magnitude level. This variation has a cyclic pattern formed from multiple overlapping frequencies, with the dominant frequencies being 3.257 and 3.282 cycles per day. As such, it belongs to a class called slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) stars. Be stars that show these types of pulsation have been dubbed SPBe stars.

==Possible companion==
It is likely that Beta Canis Minoris is a close binary with a 170-day, eccentric orbit. The companion would have about 42% of the Sun&#x27;s mass. The nature of the companion is unknown, but it is speculated that it could be a subdwarf O star remaining after binary interactions that spun up the Be primary. If confirmed, this would make it a member of the very rare Phi Persei Be+sdO-type systems.

<text>The World Cyber Games (WCG) is an international esports competition with multi-game titles in which hundreds of esports athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions also known as Esports Olympics. WCG events attempt to emulate a traditional sporting tournament, such as the Olympic Games; events included an official opening ceremony, and players from various countries competing for gold, silver, and bronze medals. WCG are held every year in cities around the world. The WCG 2020 competition received nearly views worldwide.

==General==
World Cyber Games is one of the largest global esports tournaments, with divisions in various countries. The World Cyber Games, created by International Cyber Marketing CEO Yoosup Oh and backed financially by Samsung, was considered the e-sports Olympics; events included an official opening ceremony, and players from various countries competing for gold, silver and bronze medals. The organization itself had an official mascot, and used an Olympic Games inspired logo. Organizations from each participating country conducted preliminary events at a regional level, before conducting national finals to determine the players best suited to represent them in the main World Cyber Games tournament event. All events had areas for spectators, but the tournament could also be viewed over internet video streams.

Besides providing a platform for tournament gaming, the World Cyber Games was used as a marketing tool; sponsors, such as Samsung, using the space around the venue to set up product demonstrations and stalls. In addition, advertisers saw the event as a good means to reach young male audiences, who may not be exposed to traditional advertising streams via television.

==History==

In 2000, the World Cyber Games was formed, and an event was held titled &quot;The World Cyber Game Challenge&quot;, which began with an opening ceremony on 7 October. The event was sponsored by the Republic of Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Ministry of Information and Communications, and Samsung. It brought together teams from 17 countries to compete against each other in PC games including &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, &quot;FIFA 2000&quot;, &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The tournament ended on 15 October 2000. The competition initially had 174 competitors from 17 different countries with a total prize purse of $20,000.

In 2001, the World Cyber Games held their first main event, hosted in Seoul, Korea, with a prize pool of $300,000 USD. National preliminaries were held between March and September, with the main tournament running between 5 December to 9 December. The World Cyber Games quoted an attendance of 389,000 competitors in the preliminaries, with 430 players advancing to the final tournament; teams from 24 countries in total were involved in the tournament.

In 2002, the World Cyber Games held a larger event in Daejeon, Korea with a prize pool of US$1,300,000; 450,000 competitors took part in the preliminary events, with 450 ultimately making it through to the final tournament. The 2003 tournament, which took place in Seoul again, saw an even bigger prize pool of US$2,000,000, and was the first World Cyber Games tournament to feature a console based competition, with the game on the Xbox.

In 2004, the World Cyber Games held a tournament in San Francisco, California, United States, the first tournament outside of its home country. At this stage, the prize pool was at US$2,500,000; with 642 players competing in the grand final. The tournament has since been hosted in various countries around the world; including Singapore in 2005 and Monza, Italy in 2006 - at this time Microsoft became a major sponsor to the event, who would provide software and hardware for all the events through to 2008. In addition, all games played at the tournament would be based exclusively on Windows PC&#x27;s or the Xbox console.

In 2006, the prize purse had risen to $462,000, and the event had grown to 9 different competitions and 700 qualified participants from 70 different countries.

In 2007, the event was hosted in Seattle, Washington, United States, with a total prize pool of US$4,000,000. In 2008, the tournament was hosted in Cologne, Germany; it was the first World Cyber Games tournament to incorporate a mobile-game based tournament, with &quot;Asphalt 4: Elite Racing&quot;, In 2009, the tournament was held in Chengdu, China, and featured a special promotion of the game Dungeon &amp; Fighter. The tournament was also coincided to run alongside the World Cyber Games debut reality television show, WCG Ultimate Gamer. Season 2 of WCG Ultimate Gamer was aired between August and October 2010.

In 2014 February, the CEO Brad Lee announced the closing of WCG. Several partners described difficulty working with the CEO and the organization.

In March 2017, the former Samsung owned WCG Trademark was transferred to Korean Publisher Smilegate. Plans to develop the WCG &quot;into the world&#x27;s top digital entertainment festival in the future&quot;. World Cyber Games 2018 should have been hosted in Bangkok on April 26–29, 2018, but was cancelled subsequently. World Cyber Games 2019 was hosted in Xi&#x27;an, China on July 18–21, 2019. The WCG 2020 competition received nearly views worldwide.

<doc id="396210" wikidata="Q4646485" url="?curid=396210" title="9th (Scottish) Division">
<text>The 9th (Scottish) Division, was an infantry division of the British Army during the First World War, one of the Kitchener&#x27;s Army divisions raised from volunteers by Lord Kitchener to serve on the Western Front during the First World War.

After the 1st South African Infantry Brigade Group joined in early 1916, the division was known colloquially as the &quot;Jock and Springboks&quot;.

== History ==

===Background===

A 9th Division had been formed for service during the Second Boer War, and was commanded by Henry Edward Colvile. In 1902, a 9th Division was as formed and was commanded by Edward Pemberton Leach, but it was broken-up at some point prior to the start of the war.

=== First World War ===
In the Battle of Loos, notable for being the first battle in which British forces used poison gas, the 9th (Scottish) Division assaulted the Hohenzollern Redoubt, the 5th Camerons suffered horrific casualties, and Corporal James Dalgleish Pollock gained a Victoria Cross for his actions.
The 9th (Scottish) Division took part in major fighting during the Somme offensive. Notably it relieved the 30th Division at Montauban and later attacked German positions at Bernafay Wood, where it succeeded in capturing vital objectives and forcing a German withdrawal. In the Somme offensive, the 9th (Scottish) Division liberated the village of Longueval; the village now has a statue of a Scottish piper at its crossroads that commemorates this fact (see Caterpillar Valley Cemetery) and also other pipers who served in the First World War.

<text>Adam Paul Tinley (born 4 December 1967), known professionally as Adamski, as well as Sonny Eriksson, is an English DJ, musician, singer and record producer, prominent at the time of acid house for his tracks &quot;N-R-G&quot; and &quot;Killer&quot;, a collaboration with Seal, which was a No. 1 song in the UK in 1990.

==Career==
Tinley was born in Lymington, Hampshire, England. As a youngster, influenced by punk rock and John Peel, he formed his first band The Stupid Babies when he was 11 and living in New Forest in England. He persuaded his 5-year-old brother Dominic to sing while he strummed a small guitar, and sent a demo tape to the indie label Fast Product, run by The Human League&#x27;s manager Bob Last. &quot;Everyone thought that was a really precocious and strange thing for an 11 year-old to do,&quot; Adamski recalls &quot;but I just thought that&#x27;s what everybody did&quot;. The kiddie-punk tracks were released on a sampler. When alternative BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel started playing their song &quot;Babysitters&quot; the band caused quite a stir, receiving positive write-ups in music magazines like &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. He performed with his brother Mark Tinley, and Johnny Slut of the band Specimen, as Diskord Datkord. They released their only single in 1988, an electroid cover of &quot;Identity&quot; by punk band X-Ray Spex. It was single of the week in &quot;NME&quot;.

In March 1989, Adamski was booked for his first solo gig at Le Petit Prince Restaurant in Kentish Town, run by his manager Phil Smith. Lenny D, promoter of nightclub Heaven, happened to be walking past, and was convinced by Smith to book Adamski for an all-dayer at Heaven. He quickly catapulted into the upper echelons of the nascent rave scene. Within a few weeks, Adamski was playing to 8,000 people at Sunrise Festival at Santa Pod Raceway and, after a bidding war, signed to MCA Records, producing the first rave record on MCA called &quot;Liveandirect&quot;.

He had success with this first release, which was a collection of tracks recorded live at various raves. It contained a short, live version of his first single &quot;N-R-G&quot;, as well as &quot;I Dream of You&quot;, which appeared on a free 4-track 7&quot; vinyl single given away with the music paper &quot;Record Mirror&quot; in 1989. The cover of the single &quot;N-R-G&quot; featured a mocked up Lucozade bottle with the word &quot;Lucozade&quot; replaced with &quot;N-R-G&quot;.

Adamski toured many clubs with his portable keyboard set up, playing long sets, with an MC, Daddy Chester, and later with Seal. In front of his keyboard was a UK car number plate with the word ADAMSKI on it. Early versions of future singles &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Future Love Paradise&quot; were played on some of the Seal dates.

The album, &quot;Adamski&#x27;s Thing&quot;, was issued in late 1998 on Trevor Horn&#x27;s ZTT Records label, recorded at Adrian Sherwood’s On-U Sound studios. The style followed the trend started with his 1992 album &quot;Naughty&quot;, with guitars, strings, raw vocals and introspective lyrics, but maintaining a rhythmic dance sensibility. &quot;Adamski&#x27;s Thing&quot; spawned two singles, &quot;Intravenous Venus&quot; and &quot;One of the People&quot; (a record featuring dance vocalist Gerideau, that got to No. 56 in the UK Singles Chart).

Throughout the late 1990s, Tinley shifted focus to his DJ career. He soon adopted a new moniker, Adam Sky, touring Europe, and making the odd UK appearance such as playing at the electroclash night Nag Nag Nag in London in 2002 – run by his old friend Jonny Slut. As a producer, his songs at that time also included a collaboration with musician Danny Williams. In 2007, he released a remake of The Pop Group&#x27;s 1979 single &quot;We Are All Prostitutes&quot; with Mark Stewart, which appeared on a number of compilations. His single &quot;ApeX&quot; was released on Kitsuné Music in 2006. In 2009, he began to release more material on Shir Khan&#x27;s record label.

In 2009, he found his way back to the UK to start his Futurewaltz project, working in the 3/4 time signature. Tinley’s latest alter ego is cyberbilly Sonny Eriksson - a self-styled Teddy Boy fusing rockabilly and psychobilly styles with the hypnotic, strange and electronic sounds of today and beyond.

In 2020, Adamski released &quot;Free to Kill Again&quot;, featuring 10 new interpretations of &quot;Killer&quot; with guest features by Boy George, Nina Hagen, Adrian Sherwood, Mykki Blanco, Hannah Hu and others. In 2022, Adamski released &quot;Black Butterfly&quot;, featuring Robert Owens. The track is a tribute to Mina Smallman&#x27;s daughters Nicole and Bibaa, with all proceeds donated to the charity Million Women Rise. Remixes by done by Captain Mustache, Leeroy Thornhil (The Prodigy), Mr. C (Superfreq), and Shadow Child. In October 2022, Adamski released &quot;Black Star Acid&quot; on Boys Noize Records.

<text>An Internet suite is an Internet-related software suite. Internet suites usually include a web browser, e-mail client (often with a news client and address book), download manager, HTML editor, and an IRC client.

The diversity of Internet suite offerings was greatest in the mid-1990s, when proprietary web browser vendors felt it more profitable to sell entire retail suites of applications on compact disc. However, by the end of the first browser war, the Internet suite market dwindled to one or two competitors every few years. In reaction, alternative routes of profit or funding were sought. Opera Software, for example, moved away from offering the Opera Internet suite with embedded advertisements to a completely ad-free product. Mozilla (spun out of Netscape) began to separate the Mozilla Application Suite into separate projects: Firefox, Thunderbird, and Sunbird, but Internet suite development continued with Seamonkey, which is still active under the Mozilla umbrella. A further cause of depression in the diversity of Internet suites was the rise of Ajax-based web applications (webmail, for example) which replicated most functions of their desktop client equivalents while offering cross-platform portability through web browsers, portability not offered as easily by desktop clients inside Internet suites and outside web browsers.

<text>Professional Adventure Writer or PAW (sometimes called PAWS for Professional Adventure Writing System) is a program that allows the user to write textual adventure games with graphic illustrations. It was written by Tim Gilberts, Graeme Yeandle and Phil Wade, based on Yeandle&#x27;s earlier system called &quot;The Quill&quot;.

PAW was published by Gilsoft in 1987 and quickly gained a loyal following. PAW improved over &quot;The Quill&quot; in several ways. In particular, its textual input parser was more sophisticated, meaning inputs were no longer confined to the two-word telegraphic &quot;verb noun&quot; (e.g. &quot;GO WEST; TAKE LAMP&quot;) style. PAW also supported NPCs, different character sets, and full use of the memory of the 128K ZX Spectrum. However, unlike &quot;The Quill&quot;, the PAW no longer supported other computer systems like the BBC Micro or the Commodore 64. Over 400 games were written using PAW.

To ensure that as much text as possible can be used, PAWS compresses the descriptions by replacing the most common letters combinations by tokens, using characters greater than 127 (the ones that, in the Spectrum, are used for storing the BASIC tokens).

In 2001, WinPAW was written by Douglas Harter. It could read adventures written in PAW, but ran under MS-Windows and had a few extensions to the original. The adventures made in WinPAW could only be played using the MS Windows runtime. In 2009, InPAWS was released in its first version. It allows to extract PAW adventures, edit them or create from scratch and write back a database for PAW for either Amstrad CPC or ZX Spectrum. Thus, it also allows PAW adventures to be ported between the systems.

Graeme Yeandle also released an updated version of the CP/M version of PAW for MS-DOS and called it &quot;PC Adventure Writer&quot;.

<text>The 10th (Irish) Division, was one of the first of Kitchener&#x27;s New Army K1 Army Group divisions (formed from Kitchener&#x27;s &#x27;first hundred thousand&#x27; new volunteers), authorized on 21 August 1914, after the outbreak of the Great War. It included battalions from the various provinces of Ireland. It was initially led by the Irish Lieutenant General Sir Bryan Mahon and fought at Gallipoli in 1915, Salonika, from 1915–1917, and Palestine from 1917–1918. It was the first of the Irish divisions to take to the field and was the most travelled of the Irish formations. The division served as a formation of the United Kingdom&#x27;s British Army during World War I.

==History==
Formed in Ireland on 21 August 1914, the 10th Division was sent to Gallipoli where, as part of Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stopford&#x27;s IX Corps, at Suvla Bay on 7 August it participated in the Landing at Suvla Bay and the August offensive. Some battalions of the division were landed at Anzac and fought at Chunuk Bair.

In September 1915, when the Suvla front became a stalemate, the division was moved to Salonika where it remained for almost two years and fought the Battle of Kosturino.

The division moved to Egypt in September 1917 where it joined Lieutenant General Sir Philip Chetwode&#x27;s XX Corps. It fought in the Third Battle of Gaza which succeeded in breaking the resistance of the Turkish defenders in southern Palestine.

Heavy losses on the Western Front following Operation Michael, the great German spring offensive in 1918, resulted in the transfer of ten of the division&#x27;s battalions from Palestine to France, their place being taken by Indian Army units. This left only one British battalion per brigade. The remainder of the division remained in Palestine until the end of the war with Turkey on 31 October 1918.

On 12 November 1918 the division concentrated at Sarafand, ready for moving back to Egypt. By 1 December it had returned to Cairo.

<text>In mathematics, the étale cohomology groups of an algebraic variety or scheme are algebraic analogues of the usual cohomology groups with finite coefficients of a topological space, introduced by Grothendieck in order to prove the Weil conjectures. Étale cohomology theory can be used to construct ℓ-adic cohomology, which is an example of a Weil cohomology theory in algebraic geometry. This has many applications, such as the proof of the Weil conjectures and the construction of representations of finite groups of Lie type.

==History==
Étale cohomology was introduced by , using some suggestions by Jean-Pierre Serre, and was motivated by the attempt to construct a Weil cohomology theory in order to prove the Weil conjectures. The foundations were soon after worked out by Grothendieck together with Michael Artin, and published as and SGA 4. Grothendieck used étale cohomology to prove some of the Weil conjectures (Bernard Dwork had already managed to prove the rationality part of the conjectures in 1960 using p-adic methods), and the remaining conjecture, the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by Pierre Deligne (1974) using ℓ-adic cohomology.

Further contact with classical theory was found in the shape of the Grothendieck version of the Brauer group; this was applied in short order to diophantine geometry, by Yuri Manin. The burden and success of the general theory was certainly both to integrate all this information, and to prove general results such as Poincaré duality and the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem in this context.

Grothendieck originally developed étale cohomology in an extremely general setting, working with concepts such as Grothendieck toposes and Grothendieck universes. With hindsight, much of this machinery proved unnecessary for most practical applications of the étale theory, and gave a simplified exposition of étale cohomology theory. Grothendieck&#x27;s use of these universes (whose existence cannot be proved in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory) led to some speculation that étale cohomology and its applications (such as the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem) require axioms beyond ZFC. However, in practice étale cohomology is used mainly in the case of constructible sheaves over schemes of finite type over the integers, and this needs no deep axioms of set theory: with care the necessary objects can be constructed without using any uncountable sets, and this can be done in ZFC, and even in much weaker theories.

Étale cohomology quickly found other applications, for example Deligne and George Lusztig used it to construct representations of finite groups of Lie type; see Deligne–Lusztig theory.

==Motivation==
For complex algebraic varieties, invariants from algebraic topology such as the fundamental group and cohomology groups are very useful, and one would like to have analogues of these for varieties over other fields, such as finite fields. (One reason for this is that Weil suggested that the Weil conjectures could be proved using such a cohomology theory.) In the case of cohomology of coherent sheaves, Serre showed that one could get a satisfactory theory just by using the Zariski topology of the algebraic variety, and in the case of complex varieties this gives the same cohomology groups (for coherent sheaves) as the much finer complex topology. However, for constant sheaves such as the sheaf of integers this does not work: the cohomology groups defined using the Zariski topology are badly behaved. For example, Weil envisioned a cohomology theory for varieties over finite fields with similar power as the usual singular cohomology of topological spaces, but in fact, any constant sheaf on an irreducible variety has trivial cohomology (all higher cohomology groups vanish).

The reason that the Zariski topology does not work well is that it is too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck&#x27;s key insight was to realize that there is no reason why the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these can be thought of as open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/&quot;n&quot;Z when &quot;n&quot; is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.

Some basic intuitions of the theory are these:

* The &quot;étale&quot; requirement is the condition that would allow one to apply the implicit function theorem if it were true in algebraic geometry (but it isn&#x27;t — implicit algebraic functions are called algebroid in older literature).
* There are certain basic cases, of dimension 0 and 1, and for an abelian variety, where the answers with constant sheaves of coefficients can be predicted (via Galois cohomology and Tate modules).

==Definitions==
For any scheme &quot;X&quot; the category Et(&quot;X&quot;) is the category of all étale morphisms from a scheme to &quot;X&quot;. It is an analogue of the category of open subsets of a topological space, and its objects can be thought of informally as &quot;étale open subsets&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. The intersection of two open sets of a topological space corresponds to the pullback of two étale maps to &quot;X&quot;. There is a rather minor set-theoretical problem here, since Et(&quot;X&quot;) is a &quot;large&quot; category: its objects do not form a set.

A presheaf on a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a contravariant functor from the category of open subsets to sets. By analogy we define an étale presheaf on a scheme &quot;X&quot; to be a contravariant functor from Et(&quot;X&quot;) to sets.

A presheaf &quot;F&quot; on a topological space is called a sheaf if it satisfies the sheaf condition: whenever an open subset is covered by open subsets &quot;Ui&quot;, and we are given elements of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Ui&quot;) for all &quot;i&quot; whose restrictions to &quot;Ui&quot; ∩ &quot;Uj&quot; agree for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, then they are images of a unique element of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot;). By analogy, an étale presheaf is called a sheaf if it satisfies the same condition (with intersections of open sets replaced by pullbacks of étale morphisms, and where a set of étale maps to &quot;U&quot; is said to cover &quot;U&quot; if the topological space underlying &quot;U&quot; is the union of their images). More generally, one can define a sheaf for any Grothendieck topology on a category in a similar way.

The category of sheaves of abelian groups over a scheme has enough injective objects, so one can define right derived functors of left exact functors. The étale cohomology groups &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) of the sheaf &quot;F&quot; of abelian groups are defined as the right derived functors of the functor of sections,

:formula_1

(where the space of sections Γ(&quot;F&quot;) of &quot;F&quot; is &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)). The sections of a sheaf can be thought of as Hom(Z, &quot;F&quot;) where Z is the sheaf that returns the integers as an abelian group. The idea of &quot;derived functor&quot; here is that the functor of sections doesn&#x27;t respect exact sequences as it is not right exact; according to general principles of homological algebra there will be a sequence of functors &quot;H&quot; 0, &quot;H&quot; 1, ... that represent the &#x27;compensations&#x27; that must be made in order to restore some measure of exactness (long exact sequences arising from short ones). The &quot;H&quot; 0 functor coincides with the section functor Γ.

More generally, a morphism of schemes &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; induces a map &quot;f&quot;∗ from étale sheaves over &quot;X&quot; to étale sheaves over &quot;Y&quot;, and its right derived functors are denoted by &quot;Rqf&quot;∗, for &quot;q&quot; a non-negative integer. In the special case when &quot;Y&quot; is the spectrum of an algebraically closed field (a point), &quot;R&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;f&quot;∗(&quot;F&quot; ) is the same as &quot;Hq&quot;(&quot;F&quot; ).

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a Noetherian scheme. An abelian étale sheaf &quot;F&quot; over &quot;X&quot; is called finite locally constant if it is represented by an étale cover of &quot;X&quot;. It is called constructible if &quot;X&quot; can be covered by a finite family of subschemes on each of which the restriction of &quot;F&quot; is finite locally constant. It is called torsion if &quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) is a torsion group for all étale covers &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. Finite locally constant sheaves are constructible, and constructible sheaves are torsion. Every torsion sheaf is a filtered inductive limit of constructible sheaves.

== ℓ-adic cohomology groups ==

In applications to algebraic geometry over a finite field F&quot;q&quot; with characteristic &quot;p&quot;, the main objective was to find a replacement for the singular cohomology groups with integer (or rational) coefficients, which are not available in the same way as for geometry of an algebraic variety over the complex number field. Étale cohomology works fine for coefficients Z/&quot;n&quot;Z for &quot;n&quot; co-prime to &quot;p&quot;, but gives unsatisfactory results for non-torsion coefficients. To get cohomology groups without torsion from étale cohomology one has to take an inverse limit of étale cohomology groups with certain torsion coefficients; this is called ℓ-adic cohomology, where ℓ stands for any prime number different from &quot;p&quot;. One considers, for schemes &quot;V&quot;, the cohomology groups

:formula_2

and &quot;defines&quot; the ℓ-adic cohomology group

:formula_3

as their inverse limit. Here Zℓ denotes the ℓ-adic integers, but the definition is by means of the system of &#x27;constant&#x27; sheaves with the finite coefficients Z/ℓ&quot;k&quot;Z. (There is a notorious trap here: cohomology does not commute with taking inverse limits, and the ℓ-adic cohomology group, defined as an inverse limit, is not the cohomology with coefficients in the étale sheaf Zℓ; the latter cohomology group exists but gives the &quot;wrong&quot; cohomology groups.)

More generally, if &quot;F&quot; is an inverse system of étale sheaves &quot;Fi&quot;, then the cohomology of &quot;F&quot; is defined to be the inverse limit of the cohomology of the sheaves &quot;Fi&quot;

:formula_4

and though there is a natural map

:formula_5

this is not usually an isomorphism. An ℓ-adic sheaf is a special sort of inverse system of étale sheaves &quot;Fi&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; runs through positive integers, and &quot;Fi&quot; is a module over Z/ℓ&quot;i&quot; Z and the map from &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 to &quot;Fi&quot; is just reduction mod Z/ℓ&quot;i&quot; Z.

When &quot;V&quot; is a non-singular algebraic curve of genus &quot;g&quot;, &quot;H&quot;1 is a free Zℓ-module of rank 2&quot;g&quot;, dual to the Tate module of the Jacobian variety of &quot;V&quot;. Since the first Betti number of a Riemann surface of genus &quot;g&quot; is 2&quot;g&quot;, this is isomorphic to the usual singular cohomology with Zℓ coefficients for complex algebraic curves. It also shows one reason why the condition ℓ ≠ &quot;p&quot; is required: when ℓ = &quot;p&quot; the rank of the Tate module is at most &quot;g&quot;.

Torsion subgroups can occur, and were applied by Michael Artin and David Mumford to geometric questions. To remove any torsion subgroup from the ℓ-adic cohomology groups and get cohomology groups that are vector spaces over fields of characteristic 0 one defines

:formula_6

This notation is misleading: the symbol Qℓ on the left represents neither an étale sheaf nor an ℓ-adic sheaf. The etale cohomology with coefficients in the constant etale sheaf Qℓ does also exist but is quite different from formula_7. Confusing these two groups is a common mistake.

==Properties==
In general the ℓ-adic cohomology groups of a variety tend to have similar properties to the singular cohomology groups of complex varieties, except that they are modules over the ℓ-adic integers (or numbers) rather than the integers (or rationals). They satisfy a form of Poincaré duality on non-singular projective varieties, and the ℓ-adic cohomology groups of a &quot;reduction mod p&quot; of a complex variety tend to have the same rank as the singular cohomology groups. A Künneth formula also holds.

For example, the first cohomology group of a complex elliptic curve is a free module of rank 2 over the integers, while the first ℓ-adic cohomology group of an elliptic curve over a finite field is a free module of rank 2 over the ℓ-adic integers, provided ℓ is not the characteristic of the field concerned, and is dual to its Tate module.

There is one way in which ℓ-adic cohomology groups are better than singular cohomology groups: they tend to be acted on by Galois groups. For example, if a complex variety is defined over the rational numbers, its ℓ-adic cohomology groups are acted on by the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers: they afford Galois representations.

Elements of the Galois group of the rationals, other than the identity and complex conjugation, do not usually act &quot;continuously&quot; on a complex variety defined over the rationals, so do not act on the singular cohomology groups. This phenomenon of Galois representations is related to the fact that the fundamental group of a topological space acts on the singular cohomology groups, because Grothendieck showed that the Galois group can be regarded as a sort of fundamental group. (See also Grothendieck&#x27;s Galois theory.)

==Calculation of étale cohomology groups for algebraic curves==
The main initial step in calculating étale cohomology groups of a variety is to calculate them for complete connected smooth algebraic curves &quot;X&quot; over algebraically closed fields &quot;k&quot;. The étale cohomology groups of arbitrary varieties can then be controlled using analogues of the usual machinery of algebraic topology, such as the spectral sequence of a fibration. For curves the calculation takes several steps, as follows . Let G&quot;m&quot; denote the sheaf of non-vanishing functions.

Here &quot;j&quot; is the injection of the generic point, &quot;ix&quot; is the injection of a closed point &quot;x&quot;, G&quot;m&quot;,&quot;K&quot; is the sheaf G&quot;m&quot; on (the generic point of &quot;X&quot;), and Z&quot;x&quot; is a copy of Z for each closed point of &quot;X&quot;. The groups &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;ix*&quot; Z) vanish if &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 (because &quot;ix*&quot; Z is a skyscraper sheaf) and for &quot;i&quot; = 0 they are Z so their sum is just the divisor group of &quot;X&quot;. Moreover, the first cohomology group &quot;H&quot; 1(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;j&quot;∗G&quot;m&quot;,&quot;K&quot;) is isomorphic to the Galois cohomology group &quot;H&quot; 1(&quot;K&quot;, &quot;K&quot;*) which vanishes by Hilbert&#x27;s theorem 90. Therefore, the long exact sequence of étale cohomology groups gives an exact sequence

:formula_10

where Div(&quot;X&quot;) is the group of divisors of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;K&quot; is its function field. In particular &quot;H&quot; 1(&quot;X&quot;, G&quot;m&quot;) is the Picard group Pic(&quot;X&quot;) (and the first cohomology groups of G&quot;m&quot; are the same for the étale and Zariski topologies). This step works for varieties &quot;X&quot; of any dimension (with points replaced by codimension 1 subvarieties), not just curves.

===Calculation of &quot;Hi&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, G&quot;m&quot;)===
The same long exact sequence above shows that if &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2 then the cohomology group &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, G&quot;m&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;j&quot;*G&quot;m&quot;,&quot;K&quot;), which is isomorphic to the Galois cohomology group &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;K&quot;, &quot;K&quot;*). Tsen&#x27;s theorem implies that the Brauer group of a function field &quot;K&quot; in one variable over an algebraically closed field vanishes. This in turn implies that all the Galois cohomology groups &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;K&quot;, &quot;K&quot;*) vanish for &quot;i&quot; ≥ 1, so all the cohomology groups &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, G&quot;m&quot;) vanish if &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2.

===Calculation of &quot;Hi&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;μn&quot;)===
If &quot;μn&quot; is the sheaf of &quot;n&quot;-th roots of unity and &quot;n&quot; and the characteristic of the field &quot;k&quot; are coprime integers, then:

:formula_11

where Pic&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is group of &quot;n&quot;-torsion points of Pic(&quot;X&quot;). This follows from the previous results using the long exact sequence

:formula_12

of the Kummer exact sequence of étale sheaves

:formula_13

and inserting the known values

:formula_14

In particular we get an exact sequence

:formula_15

If &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot; this argument breaks down because &quot;p&quot;-th roots of unity behave strangely over fields of characteristic &quot;p&quot;. In the Zariski topology the Kummer sequence is not exact on the right, as a non-vanishing function does not usually have an &quot;n&quot;-th root locally for the Zariski topology, so this is one place where the use of the étale topology rather than the Zariski topology is essential.

===Calculation of &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z/&quot;n&quot;Z)===
By fixing a primitive &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity we can identify the group Z/&quot;nZ with the group &quot;μn&quot; of &quot;n&quot;-th roots of unity. The étale group &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z/&quot;nZ) is then a free module over the ring Z/&quot;n&quot;Z and its rank is given by:

:formula_16

where &quot;g&quot; is the genus of the curve &quot;X&quot;. This follows from the previous result, using the fact that the Picard group of a curve is the points of its Jacobian variety, an abelian variety of dimension &quot;g&quot;, and if &quot;n&quot; is coprime to the characteristic then the points of order dividing &quot;n&quot; in an abelian variety of dimension &quot;g&quot; over an algebraically closed field form a group isomorphic to (Z/&quot;nZ)2&quot;g&quot;. These values for the étale group &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z/&quot;nZ) are the same as the corresponding singular cohomology groups when &quot;X&quot; is a complex curve.

===Calculation of &quot;H i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z/&quot;p&quot;Z)===
It is possible to calculate étale cohomology groups with constant coefficients of order divisible by the characteristic in a similar way, using the Artin–Schreier sequence

:formula_17

instead of the Kummer sequence. (For coefficients in Z/&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;Z there is a similar sequence involving Witt vectors.) The resulting cohomology groups usually have ranks less than that of the corresponding groups in characteristic 0.

==Examples of étale cohomology groups==
*If &quot;X&quot; is the spectrum of a field &quot;K&quot; with absolute Galois group &quot;G&quot;, then étale sheaves over &quot;X&quot; correspond to continuous sets (or abelian groups) acted on by the (profinite) group &quot;G&quot;, and étale cohomology of the sheaf is the same as the group cohomology of &quot;G&quot;, i.e. the Galois cohomology of &quot;K&quot;.
*If &quot;X&quot; is a complex variety, then étale cohomology with finite coefficients is isomorphic to singular cohomology with finite coefficients. (This does not hold for integer coefficients.) More generally the cohomology with coefficients in any constructible sheaf is the same.
*If &quot;F&quot; is a coherent sheaf (or G&quot;m&quot;) then the étale cohomology of &quot;F&quot; is the same as Serre&#x27;s coherent sheaf cohomology calculated with the Zariski topology (and if &quot;X&quot; is a complex variety this is the same as the sheaf cohomology calculated with the usual complex topology).
*For abelian varieties and curves there is an elementary description of ℓ-adic cohomology. For abelian varieties the first ℓ-adic cohomology group is the dual of the Tate module, and the higher cohomology groups are given by its exterior powers. For curves the first cohomology group is the first cohomology group of its Jacobian. This explains why Weil was able to give a more elementary proof of the Weil conjectures in these two cases: in general one expects to find an elementary proof whenever there is an elementary description of the ℓ-adic cohomology.

==Poincaré duality and cohomology with compact support==
The étale cohomology groups with compact support of a variety &quot;X&quot; are defined to be

:formula_18

where &quot;j&quot; is an open immersion of &quot;X&quot; into a proper variety &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;j&quot;! is the extension by 0 of the étale sheaf &quot;F&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. This is independent of the immersion &quot;j&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; has dimension at most &quot;n&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is a torsion sheaf then these cohomology groups formula_19 with compact support vanish if &quot;q&quot; &gt; 2&quot;n&quot;, and if in addition &quot;X&quot; is affine of finite type over a separably closed field the cohomology groups formula_20 vanish for &quot;q&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot; (for the last statement, see SGA 4, XIV, Cor.3.2).

More generally if &quot;f&quot; is a separated morphism of finite type from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;S&quot; (with &quot;X&quot; and &quot;S&quot; Noetherian) then the higher direct images with compact support &quot;R&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;f&quot;! are defined by

:formula_21

for any torsion sheaf &quot;F&quot;. Here &quot;j&quot; is any open immersion of &quot;X&quot; into a scheme &quot;Y&quot; with a proper morphism &quot;g&quot; to &quot;S&quot; (with &quot;f&quot; = &quot;gj&quot;), and as before the definition does not depend on the choice of &quot;j&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Cohomology with compact support is the special case of this with &quot;S&quot; a point. If &quot;f&quot; is a separated morphism of finite type then &quot;R&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;f&quot;! takes constructible sheaves on &quot;X&quot; to constructible sheaves on &quot;S&quot;. If in addition the fibers of &quot;f&quot; have dimension at most &quot;n&quot; then &quot;R&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;f&quot;! vanishes on torsion sheaves for &quot;q&quot; &gt; &quot;2n&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; is a complex variety then &quot;R&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;f&quot;! is the same as the usual higher direct image with compact support (for the complex topology) for torsion sheaves.

If &quot;X&quot; is a smooth algebraic variety of dimension &quot;N&quot; and &quot;n&quot; is coprime to the characteristic then there is a trace map

:formula_22

and the bilinear form Tr(&quot;a&quot; ∪ &quot;b&quot;) with values in Z/&quot;n&quot;Z identifies each of the groups

:formula_23

and

:formula_24

with the dual of the other. This is the analogue of Poincaré duality for étale cohomology.

==An application to curves==
{{see also|Behrend&#x27;s formula}}

This is how the theory could be applied to the local zeta-function of an algebraic curve.

Theorem. Let {{mvar|X}} be a curve of genus {{mvar|g}} defined over {{math|F&quot;p&quot;}}, the finite field with {{mvar|p}} elements. Then for {{math|&quot;n&quot; ≥ 1}}

:formula_25

where {{math|&quot;αi&quot;}} are certain algebraic numbers satisfying {{math|{{mabs|&quot;αi&quot;}} {{=}} {{sqrt|&quot;p&quot;}}}}.

This agrees with {{math|P1(F&quot;pn&quot;)}} being a curve of genus {{val|0}} with {{math|&quot;pn&quot; + 1}} points. It also shows that the number of points on any curve is rather close (within {{math|2&quot;gp&quot;&quot;n&quot; / 2}}) to that of the projective line; in particular, it generalizes Hasse&#x27;s theorem on elliptic curves.

===Idea of proof===
According to the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, the number of fixed points of any morphism {{math|&quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;}} is equal to the sum

:formula_26

This formula is valid for ordinary topological varieties and ordinary topology, but it is wrong for most &quot;algebraic&quot; topologies. However, this formula &quot;does hold&quot; for étale cohomology (though this is not so simple to prove).

The points of {{mvar|X}} that are defined over {{math|F&quot;pn&quot;}} are those fixed by {{mvar|Fn}}, where {{mvar|F}} is the Frobenius automorphism in characteristic {{mvar|p}}.

The étale cohomology Betti numbers of {{mvar|X}} in dimensions 0, 1, 2 are 1, 2&quot;g&quot;, and 1 respectively.

According to all of these,

:formula_27

This gives the general form of the theorem.

The assertion on the absolute values of the {{mvar|αi}} is the 1-dimensional Riemann Hypothesis of the Weil Conjectures.

The whole idea fits into the framework of motives: formally [&quot;X&quot;] = [point] + [line] + [1-part], and [1-part] has something like {{math|{{sqrt|&quot;p&quot;}}}} points.

<doc id="396234" wikidata="Q1129490" url="?curid=396234" title="Conway Cabal">
<text>The Conway Cabal were a group of senior Continental Army officers in late 1777 and early 1778 who aimed to have George Washington replaced as commander-in-chief of the Army during the American Revolutionary War. It was named after Brigadier-General Thomas Conway, whose letters criticizing Washington were forwarded to the Second Continental Congress. When these suggestions (which were often little more than criticisms and expressions of discontent with either Washington or the general course of the war) were made public, supporters of Washington mobilized to assist him politically. 

Conway ended up resigning from the army, and General Horatio Gates, a leading candidate to replace Washington, issued an apology for his role in events. No formal requests were ever made asking for Washington&#x27;s removal as commander in chief. There was no sign of any formal conspiracy amongst the various malcontents, although Washington was concerned that there might be one. It was the only major political threat to Washington&#x27;s command during the war.

==Background==

In the fall of 1777, British forces captured Philadelphia, the seat of the Second Continental Congress, which was forced to relocate to York, Pennsylvania. A series of military setbacks (principally the losses at Brandywine in September and Germantown in October) caused many in the Continental Army and Congress to question George Washington&#x27;s leadership of the war effort. In contrast, the northern army of General Horatio Gates had won a signal victory over John Burgoyne&#x27;s forces, compelling Burgoyne to surrender his entire army after the Battles of Saratoga. Gates controversially claimed credit for the victory. Some historians feel that this was more due to the actions of Benedict Arnold, who, in the first battle on September 19, effectively and almost independently defended his positions against repeated British assaults. It was also alleged that Gates had failed to provide Arnold with adequate reinforcements which would have turned the battle into an outright American victory, although there is not universal agreement on this matter. Gates was politically well connected to Congress. Some congressmen such as Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, and Samuel Adams wanted tighter Congressional control of the war effort and supported Gates. Although John Adams did not specifically call for Washington to be replaced, he worried that Washington was being made into a military idol, and was fearful of the effects of this upon republicanism. 

Military custom dictated that, after Saratoga, Gates would have sent his official report to Washington, who was his immediate superior. However, Gates sidestepped Washington and sent his report directly to Congress. Washington sent his staff officer, Colonel Alexander Hamilton, to meet Gates and tell him on Washington&#x27;s behalf to send three of his brigades to Washington&#x27;s troops outside Philadelphia. The logic was that Washington required more troops to fight British commander William Howe&#x27;s forces, which had just taken the capital, whereas Gates had no major British force to contend with. Gates desired to hold onto the brigades and suggested that another British force might attack. He then agreed to send only one 600-man brigade, which Hamilton discovered was the weakest of the three requested. Finally, Hamilton exacted a promise from Gates to send two brigades. At the same time, Gates wrote to Washington, rebuking him for sending Hamilton.
&quot;Conspiracy&quot; is perhaps too strong a term to use in describing varied actions taken by disaffected officers and Congressional delegates unhappy with the course of the war. Most of those involved only shared the view that Washington was a less-than-perfect commander in chief, and very few of their activities were coordinated. General Gates was used as a stalking horse to replace Washington, and had himself also engaged in some lobbying for the command, but he was not responsible for the strong response within the Congress. Opposition to Washington&#x27;s command in Pennsylvania was anchored by Thomas Mifflin, a former Congressional delegate and also a former quartermaster of the Continental Army who had previously worked closely with Washington. His view of Washington as a rank amateur was supported by Lee, Benjamin Rush, and probably others. A number of foreign officers who had been commissioned into the Continental Army were also critical of Washington. These notably included Johann de Kalb, Louis Lebègue Duportail, and Thomas Conway.

==Conway&#x27;s letter==
Thomas Conway was an Irishman who was educated in France and had served in its military. Recruited by American diplomat Silas Deane, he arrived at Washington&#x27;s headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey in the spring of 1777. With Washington&#x27;s support, Congress made him a brigadier general in the Continental Army, and he served with some distinction under Washington during the Philadelphia campaign. His time in combat included distinguished service at Brandywine and Germantown. In October 1777, Conway began lobbying Congress for a promotion to major general, including in his writings criticisms of Washington. Washington in turn had grown to distrust Conway, finding his personal conduct arrogant and unbearable. Conway had publicly admitted that his desire for promotion was rooted in the fact that if he became a major general in the Continental Army, he could become a brigadier general once he returned to the French service. Washington opposed Conway&#x27;s promotion, as he felt there were many American-born officers senior in rank to Conway and more deserving of promotion who would be upset by such a move. He identified Conway as someone &quot;without conspicuous merit&quot; and that his promotion would &quot;give a fatal blow to the existence of the army.&quot; He continued adding, &quot;It will be impossible for me to be of any further service if such insuperable difficulties are thrown in my way.&quot; This was seen as an implicit threat to resign. As part of Conway&#x27;s efforts at self-promotion, he wrote a letter to Gates in which he was reported to have said, &quot;Heaven has been determined to save your Country; or a weak General and bad Counsellors would have it.&quot;
General William Alexander (Lord Stirling) learned of this quotation in a drunken revelation by Gates&#x27; adjutant, James Wilkinson. Alexander forwarded the quote in a letter to Washington, who received it on November 8, 1777. This led Washington to consider the possibility that his subordinates were scheming behind his back to replace him. He was already aware that Gates in particular was politically well-connected and popular due to his success at Saratoga.

Washington wrote Conway a brief letter: &quot;Sir, a letter which I received last Night contained the following paragraph. In a letter from Genl Conway to Genl Gates he says&quot;, and then quotes the above passage. Conway immediately acknowledged having written to Gates, but denied having written the quoted passage. Conway also again criticized Washington in this letter, writing that &quot;although your advice in council is commonly sound and proper, you have often been influenc&#x27;d by men who Were not equal to you in point of experience, Knowledge, or judgement.&quot; Washington never saw the actual letter Conway sent to Gates. Henry Laurens did however, and sent Washington an excerpt: &quot;What pity there is but one General Gates! but the more I see of this Army the less I think it fit for general Action under its actual Chiefs [...] I speak [to] you sincerely &amp; wish I could serve under you.&quot;

General Mifflin, a man Washington also distrusted, and to whom Conway had also expressed concerns over the army&#x27;s leadership, informed Gates of what had transpired. Gates wrote a letter to Washington complaining that &quot;[t]hese letters have been stealingly copied&quot; by persons unknown to him, and that he was sending the letter to Laurens, not Washington. This attitude did nothing to placate Washington, and his relationship with Gates deteriorated.

==Board of War==
Washington had suggested the creation of a Board of War to supply the army and requested that he be able to appoint an experienced foreign officer to serve as Inspector General. Mifflin and Lee turned the suggestion into a program which would make the Board of War into the top military authority, with the Inspector General supervising Washington and reporting directly to the Board of War. The two managed to get this plan through Congress. From Conway&#x27;s letter, Washington assumed that he and Mifflin were close. In mid-November, Congress decided to appoint Mifflin and Gates to the Board of War. Conway&#x27;s letter of resignation was referred to the board, which rejected it.

==Conclusion==
Conway received his coveted promotion of Inspector General of the Army on December 13. Eventually, Washington revealed Wilkinson as his source for the letter. Gates was forced to apologize and lie about his correspondence with Conway. General Conway submitted his resignation to Congress in April 1778, which accepted it. Washington, still unsatisfied, urged his supporters to challenge Conway and his allies to duels. Wilkinson turned on Gates and challenged him, but, according to Wilkinson, Gates wept and apologized for any offense caused and the duel was called off for a time. A second duel was fought between them in August 1778, but neither party was injured. On July 4, Conway engaged Brigadier General John Cadwalader in a duel. Cadwalader shot him in the mouth and the bullet exited through his head. &quot;I have stopped the damned rascal&#x27;s lying tongue at any rate,&quot; he said. As Conway suffered from his wound, he wrote an apology to Washington, which was never answered. After recovering, he returned to France.

There is no evidence that any of the participants ever formally attempted to oust Washington. It was not properly a &quot;cabal.&quot; Rather, it was a loose network of military leaders and congressmen who lacked confidence in Washington and, in at least some cases, wanted him replaced with General Gates. After the Conway Cabal, the nation largely rallied behind Washington, who was seen more as a figure of national unity. No noticeable attempt was made to replace him for the remainder of the war.

<text>David Cox (29 April 1783 – 7 June 1859) was an English landscape painter, one of the most important members of the Birmingham School of landscape artists and an early precursor of Impressionism.

He is considered one of the greatest English landscape painters, and a major figure of the Golden age of English watercolour.

Although most popularly known for his works in watercolour, he also painted over 300 works in oil towards the end of his career, now considered &quot;one of the greatest, but least recognised, achievements of any British painter.&quot;

His son, known as David Cox the Younger (1809–1885), was also a successful artist.

==Early life in Birmingham, 1783–1804==

Cox was born on 29 April 1783 on Heath Mill Lane in Deritend, then an industrial suburb of Birmingham. His father was a blacksmith and whitesmith about whom little is known, except that he supplied components such as bayonets and barrels to the Birmingham gun trade. Cox&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a farmer and mille] from Small Heath to the east of Birmingham. Early biographers record that &quot;she had had a better education than his father, and was a woman of superior intelligence and force of character.&quot; Cox was initially expected to follow his father into the metal trade and take over his forge, but his lack of physical strength led his family to seek opportunities for him to develop his interest in art, which is said to have first become apparent when the young Cox started painting paper kites while recovering from a broken leg.

By the late 18th century Birmingham had developed a network of private academies teaching drawing and painting, established to support the needs of the town&#x27;s manufacturers of luxury metal goods, but also encouraging education in fine art, and nurturing the distinctive tradition of landscape art of the Birmingham School. Cox initially enrolled in the academy of Joseph Barber in Great Charles Street, where fellow students included the artist Charles Barber and the engraver William Radclyffe, both of whom would become important lifelong friends.

At the age of about 15 Cox was apprenticed to the Birmingham painter Albert Fielder, who produced portrait miniatures and paintings for the tops of snuffboxes from his workshop at 10 Parade in the northwest of the town. Early biographers of Cox record that he left his apprenticeship after Fielder&#x27;s suicide, with one reporting that Cox himself discovered his master&#x27;s hanging body, but this is probably a myth as Fielder is recorded at his address in Parade as late as 1825. At some time during mid-1800 Cox was given work by William Macready the elder at the Birmingham Theatre, initially as an assistant grinding colours and preparing canvases for the scene painters, but from 1801 painting scenery himself and by 1802 leading his own team of assistants and being credited in plays&#x27; publicity.

==London, 1804–1814==

In 1804 Cox was promised work by the theatre impresario Philip Astley and moved to London, taking lodgings in 16 Bridge Row, Lambeth. Although he was unable to get employment at Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre it is likely that he had already decided to try to establish himself as a professional artist, and apart from a few private commissions for painting scenery his focus over the next few years was to be on painting and exhibiting watercolours. While living in London, Cox married his landlord&#x27;s daughter, Mary Ragg and the couple moved to Dulwich in 1808.
In 1805 he made his first of many trips to Wales, with Charles Barber, his earliest dated watercolours are from this year. Throughout his lifetime he made numerous sketching tours to the Home Counties, North Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Devon.

Cox exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1805. His paintings never reached high prices, so he earned his living mainly as a drawing master. His first pupil, Colonel the Hon.H. Windsor (the future Earl of Plymouth) engaged him in 1808, Cox went on to acquire several other aristocratic and titled pupils. He also went on to write several books, including: &quot;Ackermanns&#x27; New Drawing Book&quot; (1809); &quot;A Series of Progressive Lessons&quot; (1811); &quot;Treatise on Landscape Painting&quot; (1813); and &quot;Progressive Lessons on Landscape&quot; (1816). The ninth and last edition of his series &quot;Progressive Lessons&quot;, was published in 1845.

By 1810 he was elected President of the Associated Artists in Water Colour. In 1812, following the demise of the Associated Artists, he was elected as associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colour (the old Water Colour Society). He was elected a Member of the Society in 1813, and exhibited there every year (except 1815 and 1817) until his death.

==Hereford, 1814–1827==

In the summer of 1813 Cox was appointed as the drawing master of the Royal Military College in Farnham, Surrey, but he resigned shortly afterwards, finding little sympathy with the atmosphere of a military institution. Soon after that he applied to a newspaper advertisement for a position as drawing master for Miss Crouchers&#x27; School for Young Ladies in Hereford and in Autumn 1814 moved to the town with his family. Cox taught at the school in Widemarsh Street until 1819, his substantial salary of £100 per year requiring only two days&#x27; work per week, allowing time for painting and the taking of private pupils.

Cox&#x27;s reputation as both a painter and a teacher had been building over previous years, as indicated by his election as a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours and his inclusion in John Hassell&#x27;s 1813 book &quot;Aqua Pictura&quot;, which claimed to present works by &quot;all of the most approved water coloured draftsmen.&quot; The depression that accompanied the end of the Napoleonic Wars had caused a contraction in the art market, however, and by 1814 Cox had been very short of money, requiring a loan from one of his pupils to pay even for the move to Hereford. Despite its financial advantages and its proximity to the scenery of North Wales and the Wye Valley, the move to Hereford marked a retreat in terms of his career as a painter: he sent few works to the annual exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water Colours during his first years away from London and not until 1823 would he again contribute more than 20 pictures.

Between 1823 and 1826 he had Joseph Murray Ince as a pupil.

==London, 1827–1841==

He made his first trip to the Continent, to Belgium and the Netherlands in 1826 and subsequently moved to London the following year.

He exhibited for the first time with the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1829, and with the Liverpool Academy in 1831. In 1839, two of Cox&#x27;s watercolours were bought from the Old Water Colour Society exhibition by the Marquis of Conynha for Queen Victoria.

==Birmingham, 1841–1859==
In May 1840 Cox wrote to one of his Birmingham friends: &quot;I am making preparations to sketch in oil, and also to paint, and it is my intention to spend most of my time in Birmingham for the purpose of practice.&quot; Cox had been considering a return to painting in oils since 1836 and in 1839 had taken lessons in oil painting from William James Müller, to whom he had been introduced by mutual friend George Arthur Fripp. Hostility between the Society of Painters in Water Colours and the Royal Academy made it difficult for an artist to be recognised for work in both watercolour and oil in London, however, and it is likely that Cox would have preferred to explore this new medium in the more supportive environment of his home town. By the early 1840s his income from sales of his watercolours was sufficient to allow him to abandon his work as a drawing master, and in June 1841 he moved with his wife to Greenfield House in Harborne, then a village on Birmingham&#x27;s south western outskirts. It was this move that would enable the higher levels of freedom and experimentation that were to characterise his later work.
In Harborne, Cox established a steady routine – working in watercolour in the morning and oils in the afternoon. He would visit London every spring to attend the major exhibitions, followed by one or more sketching excursions, continuing the pattern that he had established in the 1830s. From 1844 these tours evolved into a yearly trip to Betws-y-Coed in North Wales to work outdoors in both oil and watercolour, gradually becoming the focus for an annual summer artists colony that continued until 1856 with Cox as its &quot;presiding genius&quot;.

Cox&#x27;s experience of trying to exhibit his oils in London was short and unsuccessful: in 1842 he made his only submission to the Society of British Artists; one oil painting was exhibited at each of the British Institution and the Royal Academy in 1843; and two oil paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1844 – the last that would be exhibited in London during his lifetime.

Cox showed regularly at the Birmingham Society of Arts and its successor, the Birmingham Society of Artists, becoming a member in 1842.

Cox suffered a stroke on 12 June 1853 that temporarily paralysed him, and permanently affected his eyesight, memory and coordination.

By 1857 however, his eyesight had deteriorated. An exhibition of his work was arranged in 1858 by the Conversazione Society Hampstead, and in 1859 a retrospective exhibition was held at the German Gallery Bond Street, London. Cox died several months later. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peters, Harborne, Birmingham, under a chestnut tree, alongside his wife Mary.

==Work==

===Early work===
In the spring of 1811 Cox made a small number of notable works in oils during a visit to Hastings with his family. It is not known why he didn&#x27;t continue working in this medium at the time, but the five known surviving examples were described in 1969 as &quot;surely some of the most brilliant examples of the genre in England&quot;.

===Mature work===
Cox reached artistic maturity after his move to Hereford in 1814. Although only two major watercolours can confidently be traced to the period between Cox&#x27;s arrival in the town and the end of the decade, both of these – &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Row, Hereford&quot; of 1815 and &quot;Lugg Meadows, near Hereford&quot; of 1817 – mark advances on his earlier work.

===Later work===
Cox&#x27;s later work produced after his move to Birmingham in 1841 was marked by simplification, abstraction and a stripping down of detail. His art of the period combined the breadth and weight characteristic of the earlier English watercolour school, together with a boldness and freedom of expression comparable to later impressionism. His concern with capturing the fleeting nature of weather, atmosphere and light was similar to that of John Constable, but Cox stood apart from the older painter&#x27;s focus on capturing material detail, instead employing a high degree of generalisation and a focus on overall effect.

The quest for character over precision in representing nature was an established characteristic of the Birmingham School of landscape artists with which Cox had been associated early in his life, and as early as 1810 Cox&#x27;s work had been criticised for its &quot;sketchiness of finish&quot; and &quot;cloudy confusion of objects&quot;, which were held to betray &quot;the coarseness of scene-painting&quot;. During the 1840s and 1850s Cox took this &quot;peculiar manner&quot; to new extremes, incorporating the techniques of the sketch into his finished works to a far greater degree.

Cox&#x27;s watercolour technique of the 1840s was sufficiently different from his earlier methods to need explanation to his son in 1842, despite the fact that his son had been helping him teach and paint since 1827. The materials used for his later works in watercolour also differed from his earlier periods: he used black chalk instead of graphite pencil as his primary drawing medium, and the rough and absorbent &quot;Scotch&quot; wrapping paper for which he became well-known – both of these were related to his development of a rougher and freer style.

==Influence and legacy==
By the 1840s Cox, alongside Peter De Wint and Copley Fielding, had become recognised as one of the leading figures of the English landscape watercolour style of the first half of the 19th century. This judgement was complicated by reaction to the rougher and bolder style of Cox&#x27;s later Birmingham work, which was widely ignored or condemned. While by this time De Wint and Fielding were essentially continuing in a long-established tradition, Cox was creating a new one.

A group of young artists working in Cox&#x27;s watercolour style emerged well before his death, including William Bennett, David Hall McKewan and Cox&#x27;s son David Cox Jr. By 1850 Bennett in particular had become recognised as &quot;perhaps the most distinguished among the landscape painters&quot; for his Cox-like vigorous and decisive style. Such early followers concentrated on the example of Cox&#x27;s more moderate earlier work and steered clear of what were then seen as the excesses of Cox&#x27;s later years. During a period dominated by sleek and detailed picturesque landscape, however, they were still condemned by publications such as &quot;The Spectator&quot; as &quot;the &#x27;blottesque&#x27; school&quot;, and failed to establish themselves as a cohesive movement.

John Ruskin in 1857 condemned the work of the Society of Painters in Water-colours as &quot;a kind of potted art, of an agreeable flavour, suppliable and taxable as a patented commodity&quot;, excluding only the late work of Cox, about which he wrote &quot;there is not any other landscape which comes near these works of David Cox in simplicity or seriousness&quot;.

An 1881 book, &quot;A Biography of David Cox: With Remarks on His Works and Genius&quot;, was based on a manuscript by Cox&#x27;s friend William Hall, edited and expanded by John Thackray Bunce, editor of the Birmingham Daily Post.

There are two Blue Plaque memorials commemorating him at 116 Greenfield Road, Harborne, Birmingham, , and at 34 Foxley Road, Kennington, London, SW9, where he lived from 1827. .

His pupils included Birmingham architectural artist, Allen Edward Everitt (1824–1882).

A bust of Cox is in the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists&#x27; gallery.

===Public collections===

Several of his works are in Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, having been donated by Joseph Henry Nettlefold, on the condition it opened on Sundays. His work is also held at the Louvre, British Museum, Tate Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, and in Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Oxford and Cambridge. The Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight shows a number of Cox&#x27;s watercolours bought by Lever through James Orrock. Some of them have since been confirmed as forgeries. American collections holding Cox&#x27;s work include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Cleveland Art Museum, Fogg Art Museum, Rhode Island School of Design, High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Princeton University Art Museum, and The Huntington Library.

In 1983, an exhibition celebrating the bicentenary of the artist&#x27;s birth was organized by the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery and curated by Stephen Wildman. The exhibition traveled to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in the same year. An exhibition of his work was held at the Yale Center for British Art in the US in 2008, traveling to Birmingham in 2009.

<text>Benjamin Pettit (born 12 March 1972), better known as DJ Zinc, is a British DJ and record producer. Zinc first became known for 1995&#x27;s &quot;Super Sharp Shooter&quot;, a hip hop/jungle fusion, notably one of the pioneering drum &amp; bass anthems of its time. He went on to produce drum and bass, breakbeat and more recently UK garage and house.

==Biography==
Zinc&#x27;s career as a DJ and producer stretches the steady evolution of hardcore from its house roots through ragga and hip hop-styled hardstep and beyond. In 1991, he began his radio show with then partner DJ Swift on London&#x27;s Impact FM. He continued to DJ with Swift onto Eruption FM and later solo on Rinse FM since it gained a license.

He continued to DJ on a regular basis, and was one of the first drum and bass producers to score a hit in the 2-step garage market courtesy of his 1999 single &quot;138 Trek&quot;, which reached No. 27 on the UK Singles Chart in November 2000.

His productions have been relatively popular outside the drum and bass scene, most notably in the breaks genre under the pseudonym Jammin.

Zinc produced and DJ&#x27;d as part of the Ganja Kru and True Playaz collectives, often in association with DJ Hype from 1996 to 2002. He ran the Bingo Beats record label, which released both drum and bass and breaks records from 2002 to 2008. He has been known to release records under the alias of Dope Skillz, Jammin and Jelly Jams plus others.

In 2001, Zinc released a remix compilation album of his own productions called &quot;Beats by Design&quot; which included &quot;138 Trek&quot;. By August 2004, he released his second album, &quot;Faster&quot;, a concept album of sorts. The album, as the name suggests, ups the tempo little-by-little for each song. The title track and album opener, epitomises this and is a grimy crawl through bass and beat that speeds up from 40bpm into the early 100s by its end.

In 2007, Zinc stopped making and playing drum and bass, citing &quot;disenchantment with the scene&quot;. He started producing again in 2009 with a fusion of deep house, funky house and fidget house, which he believed did not fit into any of these subgenres. He later named his new sound &quot;crack house&quot;. This style developed alongside bassline and bass house to evolve into the homogenized UK Bass music of today. 

In October 2009, DJ Zinc released &quot;Crack House EP&quot; encompassing his new sound of the crack house genre. A follow-up to this EP, &quot;Crack House Vol. 2&quot; was released in July 2010. 

In November 2009, DJ Zinc created a 2-hour mix for broadcasting on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s essential mix.

<text>Banksy is a pseudonymous England-based street artist, political activist, and film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation. Active since the 1990s, his satirical street art and subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed in a distinctive stenciling technique. His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls, and bridges throughout the world. His work grew out of the Bristol underground scene, which involved collaborations between artists and musicians. Banksy says that he was inspired by 3D, a graffiti artist and founding member of the musical group Massive Attack.

Banksy displays his art on publicly visible surfaces such as walls and self-built physical prop pieces. He no longer sells photographs or reproductions of his street graffiti, but his public &quot;installations&quot; are regularly resold, often even by removing the wall on which they were painted. Much of his work can be classified as temporary art. A small number of his works are officially, non-publicly, sold through an agency he created called Pest Control. Banksy directed and starred in the documentary film &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot;, which made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. In January 2011, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film. Banksy received the Webby Person of the Year award at the 2014 Webby Awards.

== Identity ==
Banksy&#x27;s name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation. In a 2003 interview with Simon Hattenstone of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Banksy is described as &quot;white, 28, scruffy casual—jeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring. He looks like a cross between Jimmy Nail and Mike Skinner of The Streets.&quot; An ITV News segment of 2003 featured a short interview with someone identified in the reporting as Banksy. Banksy began as an artist at the age of 14, was expelled from school, and served time in prison for petty crime. According to Hattenstone, &quot;anonymity is vital to him because graffiti is illegal&quot;. Banksy reportedly lived in Easton, Bristol, during the late 1990s, before moving to London around 2000. 

&quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; claimed in 2008 that Banksy is Robin Gunningham, born on 28 July 1974 in Yate, from Bristol. Several of Gunningham&#x27;s associates and former schoolmates at Bristol Cathedral School have corroborated this, and, in 2016, a study by researchers at the Queen Mary University of London using geographic profiling found that the incidence of Banksy&#x27;s works correlated with the known movements of Gunningham. According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Gunningham began employing the name Robin Banks, which eventually became Banksy. Two cassette sleeves featuring Banksy&#x27;s art work from 1993, for the Bristol band Mother Samosa, exist with Gunningham&#x27;s signature.
In June 2017, DJ Goldie referred to Banksy as &quot;Rob&quot; in an interview for a podcast. In an interview with the BBC in 2003, which was rediscovered in November 2023, reporter Nigel Wrench asked if Banksy is called Robert Banks; Banksy responded that his forename is Robbie. 

Other alternate speculations on Banksy&#x27;s identity include the following:
* Robert Del Naja (also known as 3D), a member of the trip hop band Massive Attack, had been a graffiti artist during the 1980s prior to forming the band, and was previously identified as a personal friend of Banksy.
* In 2020, users on Twitter began to speculate that former &quot;Art Attack&quot; presenter Neil Buchanan was Banksy. This was denied by Buchanan&#x27;s publicist.
* In 2022, Billy Gannon, a local councillor in Pembroke Dock was rumoured to be Banksy. He resigned because the speculation was affecting his ability to carry out the duties of a councillor. &quot;I&#x27;m being asked to prove who I am not, and the person that I am not may not exist,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, how am I supposed to prove that I&#x27;m not somebody who doesn&#x27;t exist? Just how do you do that?&quot;

In October 2014, an internet hoax circulated that Banksy had been arrested and his identity revealed.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1990–2001) ===

Banksy started as a freehand graffiti artist in 1990–1994 as one of Bristol&#x27;s DryBreadZ Crew (DBZ), with two other artists known as Kato and Tes. He was inspired by local artists and his work was part of the larger Bristol underground scene with Nick Walker, Inkie and 3D. During this time he met Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides, who began selling Banksy&#x27;s work, later becoming his agent. By 2000 he had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time it took to complete a work. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this technique, he soon became more widely noticed for his art around Bristol and London. He was the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s, and toured with the club to Mexico in 2001. Banksy&#x27;s first known large wall mural was &quot;The Mild Mild West&quot; painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors&#x27; office on Stokes Croft in Bristol. It depicts a teddy bear lobbing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.

Banksy&#x27;s stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans. The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist, or anti-establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly.

=== Exhibitions (2002–2003) ===
On 19 July 2002, Banksy&#x27;s first Los Angeles exhibition debuted at 33 Gallery, a tiny Silver Lake venue owned by Frank Sosa and was on view until 18 August. The exhibition, entitled &quot;Existencilism&quot;, &quot;an Exhibition of Art, Lies and Deviousness&quot; was curated by 33 Gallery, Malathion LA&#x27;s Chris Vargas, Funk Lazy Promotions&#x27; Grace Jehan, and B+. The flyer of the exhibition indicates an opening reception was followed by a performance by Money Mark with DJ&#x27;s Jun, AL Jackson, Rhettmatic, J.Rocc, and Coleman. Some of the paintings exhibited included &quot;Smiley Copper H&quot; (2002), &quot;Leopard and Barcode&quot; (2002), &quot;Bomb Hugger&quot; (2002), and &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; (2002).

In 2003, at an exhibition called &quot;Turf War&quot;, held in a London warehouse, Banksy painted on animals. At the time he gave one of his very few interviews, to the BBC&#x27;s Nigel Wrench. Although the RSPCA declared the conditions suitable, an animal rights activist chained herself to the railings in protest. An example of his subverted paintings is Monet&#x27;s &quot;Water Lily Pond&quot;, adapted to include urban detritus such as litter and a shopping trolley floating in its reflective waters; another is Edward Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, redrawn to show that the characters are looking at a British football hooligan, dressed only in his Union Flag underpants, who has just thrown an object through the glass window of the café. These oil paintings were shown at a twelve-day exhibition in Westbourne Grove, London in 2005.

Banksy, along with Shepard Fairey, Dmote, and others, created work at a warehouse exhibition in Alexandria, Sydney, for Semi-Permanent in 2003. Approximately 1,500 people attended.

=== £10 notes to &quot;Barely Legal&quot; (2004–2006) ===

In August 2004, Banksy produced a quantity of spoof British £10 notes replacing the picture of the Queen&#x27;s head with Diana, Princess of Wales&#x27;s head and changing the text &quot;Bank of England&quot; to &quot;Banksy of England&quot;. Someone threw a large wad of these into a crowd at Notting Hill Carnival that year, which some recipients then tried to spend in local shops. These notes were also given with invitations to a Santa&#x27;s Ghetto exhibition by Pictures on Walls. The individual notes have since been selling on eBay. A wad of the notes was also thrown over a fence and into the crowd near the &quot;NME&quot; signing tent at the Reading Festival. A limited run of 50 signed posters containing ten uncut notes was also produced and sold by Pictures on Walls for £100 each to commemorate the death of Princess Diana. One of these sold in October 2007 at Bonhams auction house in London for £24,000.

The reproduction of images of the banknotes classifies as a criminal offence (s.18 Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981). In 2016, the American Numismatic Society received an email from a Reproductions Officer at the Bank of England, which brought attention to the illegality of publishing photos of the banknotes on their website without prior permission. The Bank of England holds the copyright over all its banknotes.

Also in 2004, Banksy created a limited edition screenprint titled &quot;Napalm (Can&#x27;t Beat That Feeling).&quot; In the print, Banksy appropriated the image of Phan Thi Kim Phuc, a Vietnamese girl who appeared in the iconic 1972 photograph &quot;The Terror of War&quot; by Nick Ut. &quot;Napalm&quot; shows the image of Kim Phuc as seen in the original photo, but no longer within the tragic war setting. Instead, he situates the young girl against an empty background, still screaming, but now accompanied by Ronald McDonald and Mickey Mouse. The two characters hold her hands as they cheerfully gesture to an invisible audience, seemingly oblivious to the terrified girl. The image of Kim Phuc is flat, grainy and monochromatic; in most of the prints, Ronald McDonald and Mickey Mouse are yellow. In a few limited prints, the corporate characters wear pink or orange. Banksy produced 150 signed and 500 unsigned copies of &quot;Napalm&quot;.

In August 2005, Banksy, on a trip to the Palestinian territories, created nine images on the Israeli West Bank wall.

Banksy held an exhibition called &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, billed as a &quot;three-day vandalised warehouse extravaganza&quot; in Los Angeles, on the weekend of 16 September 2006. The exhibition featured a live &quot;elephant in a room&quot;, painted in a pink and gold floral wallpaper pattern, which, according to leaflets handed out at the exhibition, was intended to draw attention to the issue of world poverty. Although the Animal Services Department had issued a permit for the elephant, after complaints from animal rights activists, the elephant appeared unpainted on the final day. Its owners rejected claims of mistreatment and said that the elephant had done &quot;many, many movies. She&#x27;s used to makeup.&quot; Banksy also made artwork displaying Queen Victoria as a lesbian and satirical pieces that incorporated art made by Andy Warhol and Leonardo da Vinci.

Peter Gibson, a spokesman for Keep Britain Tidy, asserts that Banksy&#x27;s work is simple vandalism. Another official for the same organisation stated: &quot;We are concerned that Banksy&#x27;s street art glorifies what is essentially vandalism.&quot;

=== Banksy effect (2006–2007) ===
After Christina Aguilera bought an original of Queen Victoria as a lesbian and two prints for £25,000, on 19 October 2006, a set of Kate Moss paintings sold in Sotheby&#x27;s London for £50,400, setting an auction record for Banksy&#x27;s work. The six silk-screen prints, featuring the model painted in the style of Andy Warhol&#x27;s Marilyn Monroe pictures, sold for five times their estimated price. Their stencil of a green &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; with real paint dripping from her eyes sold for £57,600 at the same auction.
In December, journalist Max Foster coined the phrase, &quot;the Banksy effect&quot;, to illustrate how interest in other street artists was growing on the back of Banksy&#x27;s success.

On 21 February 2007, Sotheby&#x27;s auction house in London auctioned three works, reaching the highest ever price for a Banksy work at auction: over £102,000 for &quot;Bombing Middle England&quot;. Two of his other graffiti works, &quot;Girl with Balloon&quot; and &quot;Bomb Hugger&quot;, sold for £37,200 and £31,200 respectively, which were well above their estimated prices. The following day&#x27;s auction saw a further three Banksy works reach soaring prices: &quot;Ballerina with Action Man Parts&quot; reached £96,000; &quot;Glory&quot; sold for £72,000; &quot;Untitled (2004)&quot; sold for £33,600; all significantly above price estimates. To coincide with the second day of auctions, Banksy updated his website with a new image of an auction house scene showing people bidding on a picture that said, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe You Morons Actually Buy This Shit.&quot;

In February 2007, the owners of a house with a Banksy mural on the side in Bristol decided to sell the house through Red Propeller art gallery after offers fell through because the prospective buyers wanted to remove the mural. It is listed as a mural that comes with a house attached.

In April 2007, Transport for London painted over Banksy&#x27;s image of a scene from Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns. Although the image was very popular, Transport for London claimed that the graffiti created &quot;a general atmosphere of neglect and social decay which in turn encourages crime&quot; and their staff are &quot;professional cleaners not professional art critics&quot;. Banksy painted the same site again and, initially, the actors were portrayed as holding real guns instead of bananas, but they were adorned with banana costumes. Sometime later, Banksy made a tribute artwork over this second &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; work. The tribute was for 19-year-old British graffiti artist Ozone who, along with fellow artist Wants, was hit by an underground train in Barking, east London on 12 January 2007. Banksy depicted an angel wearing a bullet-proof vest holding a skull. He also wrote a note on his website saying:

On 27 April 2007, a new record high for the sale of Banksy&#x27;s work was set with the auction of the work &quot;Space Girl and Bird&quot; fetching £288,000 (US$576,000) around 20 times the estimate at Bonhams of London.
On 21 May 2007 Banksy gained the award for Art&#x27;s Greatest living Briton. Banksy, as expected, did not turn up to collect his award and continued with his anonymous status.
On 4 June 2007, it was reported that Banksy&#x27;s &quot;The Drinker&quot; had been stolen. In October 2007, most of his works offered for sale at Bonhams auction house in London sold for more than twice their reserve price.

Banksy has published a &quot;manifesto&quot; on his website. The text of the manifesto is credited as the diary entry of British Lieutenant Colonel Mervin Willett Gonin, DSO, which is exhibited in the Imperial War Museum. It describes how a shipment of lipstick to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp immediately after its liberation at the end of World War II helped the internees regain their humanity. However, as of 18 January 2008, Banksy&#x27;s Manifesto has been replaced with Graffiti Heroes No. 03, which describes Peter Chappell&#x27;s graffiti quest of the 1970s that worked to free George Davis from imprisonment. By 12 August 2009 he was relying on Emo Philips&#x27; &quot;When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised God doesn&#x27;t work that way, so I stole one and prayed for forgiveness.&quot;
A small number of Banksy&#x27;s works can be seen in the movie &quot;Children of Men&quot;, including a stenciled image of two policemen kissing and another stencil of a child looking down a shop.

Banksy, who &quot;is not represented by any of the commercial galleries that sell his work second hand (including Lazarides Ltd, Andipa Gallery, Bank Robber, Dreweatts, etc.)&quot;, claims that the exhibition at Vanina Holasek Gallery in New York City (his first major exhibition in that city) is unauthorised. The exhibition featured 62 of their paintings and prints.

=== 2008 ===
In March, Nathan Wellard and Maev Neal, a couple from Norfolk, UK, made headlines in Britain when they decided to sell their mobile home that contains a 30-foot mural, entitled &quot;Fragile Silence&quot;, done by Banksy a decade prior to his rise to fame. According to Nathan Wellard, Banksy had asked the couple if he could use the side of their home as a &quot;large canvas&quot;, to which they agreed. In return for the &quot;canvas&quot;, the Bristol stencil artist gave them two free tickets to the Glastonbury Festival. The mobile home purchased by the couple 11 years earlier for £1,000, was priced at £500,000.

Also in March 2008, a stencilled graffiti work appeared on Thames Water tower in the middle of the Holland Park roundabout, and it was widely attributed to Banksy. It was of a child painting the tag &quot;Take this—Society!&quot; in bright orange. London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham spokesman, Councillor Greg Smith branded the art as vandalism, and ordered its immediate removal, which was carried out by H&amp;F council workmen within three days.

In late August 2008, marking the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and the associated levee failure disaster, Banksy produced a series of works in New Orleans, Louisiana, mostly on buildings derelict since the disaster.

A stencil painting attributed to Banksy appeared at a vacant petrol station in the Ensley neighbourhood of Birmingham, Alabama on 29 August as Hurricane Gustav approached the New Orleans area. The painting, depicting a hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan hanging from a noose, was quickly covered with black spray paint and later removed altogether.
His first official exhibition in New York City, &quot;The Village Pet Store and Charcoal Grill&quot;, opened 5 October 2008. The animatronic pets in the store window include a mother hen watching over her baby Chicken McNuggets as they peck at a barbecue sauce packet, and a rabbit putting makeup on in a mirror.

The Westminster City Council stated in October 2008 that the work &quot;One Nation Under CCTV&quot;, painted in April 2008 would be painted over as it was graffiti. The council said it would remove any graffiti, regardless of the reputation of its creator, and specifically stated that Banksy &quot;has no more right to paint graffiti than a child&quot;. Robert Davis, the chairman of the council planning committee told &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper: &quot;If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art.&quot; The work was painted over in April 2009.
In December 2008, &quot;The Little Diver&quot;, a Banksy image of a diver in a duffle coat in Melbourne, Australia, was destroyed. The image had been protected by a sheet of clear perspex; however, silver paint was poured behind the protective sheet and later tagged with the words &quot;Banksy woz ere&quot;. The image was almost completely obliterated.

Banksy has also been long criticised for copying the work of Blek le Rat, who created the life-sized stencil technique in early 1980s Paris and used it to express a similar combination of political commentary and humorous imagery. Blek has praised Banksy for his contribution to urban art, but said in an interview for the documentary &quot;Graffiti Wars&quot; that some of Banksy&#x27;s more derivative work makes him &quot;angry&quot;, saying that &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to find a technique and style in art so when you have a style and you see someone else is taking it and reproducing it, you don&#x27;t like that.&quot;

==== The Cans Festival (2008) ====
In London, over the weekend 3–5 May 2008, Banksy hosted an exhibition called &quot;The Cans Festival&quot;. It was situated on Leake Street, a road tunnel formerly used by Eurostar underneath London Waterloo station. Graffiti artists with stencils were invited to join in and paint their own artwork, as long as it did not cover anyone else&#x27;s. Banksy invited artists from around the world to exhibit their works.

=== 2009 ===

In May 2009, Banksy parted company with agent Steve Lazarides and announced that Pest Control, the handling service who act on his behalf, would be the only point of sale for new works.
On 13 June 2009, the Banksy vs Bristol Museum show opened at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, featuring more than 100 works of art, including animatronics and installations; it is his largest exhibition yet, featuring 78 new works. Reaction to the show was positive, with over 8,500 visitors to the show on the first weekend. Over the course of the twelve weeks, the exhibition was visited over 300,000 times.
In September 2009, a Banksy work parodying the Royal Family was partially destroyed by Hackney Council after they served an enforcement notice for graffiti removal to the former address of the property owner. The mural had been commissioned for the 2003 Blur single &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; and the property owner, who had allowed it to be painted, was reported to have been in tears when she saw it was being painted over.

In December 2009, Banksy marked the end of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference by painting four murals on global warming. One included the phrase, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in global warming&quot;, with the words being submerged in water.
A feud and graffiti war between Banksy and King Robbo broke out when Banksy allegedly painted over one of Robbo&#x27;s tags. The feud has led to many of Banksy&#x27;s works being altered by graffiti writers.

=== &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; and United States (2010) ===
The world premiere of the film &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; occurred at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on 24 January. He created 10 street artworks around Park City and Salt Lake City to tie in with the screening. In February, The Whitehouse public house in Liverpool, England, was sold for £114,000 at auction. The side of the building has an image of a giant rat by Banksy.

In March 2010, a modified version of the work &quot;Forgive Us Our Trespassing&quot;–a kneeling boy with a spray-painted halo–was displayed at London Bridge Station on a poster. This version of the work did not possess the halo due to its stylistic nature and the prevalence of graffiti in the underground. After a few days the halo was repainted by a graffitist, so Transport for London disposed of the poster.

In April, to coincide with the premiere of &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; in San Francisco, five of his works appeared in various parts of the city. Banksy reportedly paid a San Francisco Chinatown building owner $50 for the use of their wall for one of his stencils.
In May 2010, seven new Banksy works of art appeared in Toronto, Canada. 

In May, to coincide with the premiere of &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; in Royal Oak, Banksy visited the Detroit area and left his mark in several places in Detroit and Warren. Shortly after, his work depicting a little boy holding a can of red paint next to the words &quot;I remember when all this was trees&quot; was excavated by the 555 Nonprofit Gallery and Studios. The gallery claimed that they did not intend to sell the work, but planned to preserve it and display it at their Detroit gallery. It was later sold in 2015 for $137,500. There was also an attempted removal of one of the Warren works known as &quot;Diamond Girl&quot;. While in the United States, Banksy also completed a painting in Chinatown, Boston, known as Follow Your Dreams.

In late January 2011, &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; was nominated for a 2010 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Banksy released a statement about the nomination, stating, &quot;This is a big surprise... I don&#x27;t agree with the concept of award ceremonies, but I&#x27;m prepared to make an exception for the ones I&#x27;m nominated for. The last time there was a naked man covered in gold paint in my house, it was me.&quot; Leading up to the Oscars, Banksy blanketed Los Angeles with street art. Many people speculated if Banksy would show up at the Oscars in disguise and make a surprise appearance if he won the Oscar. &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; did not win the award, which went to &quot;Inside Job&quot;. In early March 2011, Banksy responded to the Oscars with an artwork in Weston-super-Mare, UK, of a little girl holding the Oscar and pouting. Many people think that it is about 15-month-old Lara, who dropped and damaged her father&#x27;s (&quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; co-producer Simon Egan) Oscar statue. &quot;Exit Through the Gift Shop&quot; was broadcast on British public television station Channel 4 on 13 August 2011.

Banksy was credited with the opening couch gag for the 2010 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;MoneyBart&quot;, depicting people working in deplorable conditions and using endangered or mythical animals to make both the episodes cel-by-cel and the merchandise connected with the program. His name appears several times throughout the episode&#x27;s opening sequence, spray-painted on assorted walls and signs. Fox sanitised parts of the opening &quot;for taste&quot; and to make it less grim. In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. According to Banksy, the storyboard &quot;led to delays, disputes over broadcast standards and a threatened walkout by the animation department&quot;. Executive director Al Jean jokingly said, &quot;This is what you get when you outsource.&quot;

=== 2011–2013 ===
In May 2011 Banksy released a lithographic print which showed a smoking petrol bomb contained in a &#x27;Tesco Value&#x27; bottle. This followed a long-running campaign by locals against the opening of a Tesco Express supermarket in Banksy&#x27;s home city of Bristol. Violent clashes had taken place between police and demonstrators in the Stokes Croft area. Banksy produced the poster ostensibly to raise money for local groups in the Stokes Croft area and to raise money for the legal defence of those arrested during the riots. The posters were sold exclusively at the Bristol Anarchists Bookfair in Stokes Croft for £5 each. In December, he unveiled &quot;Cardinal Sin&quot; at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. The bust, which replaces a priest&#x27;s face with a pixelated effect, was a statement on the child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church.

In May 2012 his &quot;Parachuting Rat&quot;, painted in Melbourne in the late 1990s, was accidentally destroyed by plumbers installing new pipes. In July, prior to the 2012 Olympic Games Banksy posted photographs of paintings with an Olympic theme on his website but did not disclose their location.

On 18 February 2013, BBC News reported that a recent Banksy mural, known as the &quot;Slave Labour&quot; mural portraying a young child sewing Union Flag bunting (created around the time of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), had been removed from the side of a Poundland store in Wood Green, north London, and soon appeared for sale in Fine Art Auctions Miami&#x27;s catalogue (a US auction site based in Florida). News of this caused &quot;lots of anger&quot; in the local community and is considered by some to be a theft. Fine Art Auctions Miami had rejected claims of theft, saying it had signed a contract with a &quot;well-known collector&quot; and that &quot;everything was above board&quot;; despite this, the local councillor for Wood Green campaigned for the work&#x27;s return. On the scheduled day of the auction, Fine Art Auctions Miami withdrew the work of art from the sale.

On 11 May, BBC News reported that the same Banksy mural was up for auction again in Covent Garden by the Sincura Group. The auction was scheduled to take place in June, and was expected to fetch up to £450,000. On 24 September, after over a year since his previous piece, a new mural went up on his website along with the subtitle &quot;Better Out Than In&quot;.

Much criticism came forward during his series of works in New York in 2013. Many New York street artists, such as TrustoCorp, criticised Banksy, and much of his work was defaced. In his column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, satirist Charlie Brooker wrote in 2006 that Banksy&#x27;s &quot;work looks dazzlingly clever to idiots&quot;.

==== &quot;Better Out Than In&quot; (2013) ====
On 1 October 2013, Banksy began a one-month &quot;show on the streets of New York [City]&quot;, for which he opened a separate website and granted an interview to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; via his publicist.

A pop-up boutique of about 25 spray-art canvases appeared on Fifth Avenue near Central Park on 12 October. Tourists were able to buy Banksy art for just $60 each. In a note posted to his website, the artist wrote: &quot;Please note this was a one-off. The stall will not be there again.&quot; The BBC estimated that the street-stall art pieces could be worth as much as $31,000. The booth was staffed by an unknown elderly man who went about four hours before making a sale, yawning and eating lunch as people strolled by without a second glance at the work. Banksy chronicled the surprise sale in a video posted to his website noting, &quot;Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each.&quot; Two of the canvasses sold at a July 2014 auction for $214,000.

Asked about the artist&#x27;s presence in New York, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had led a citywide graffiti cleanup operation in 2002, said he did not consider graffiti a form of art. One creation was a fiberglass sculpture of Ronald McDonald and a real person, barefoot and in ragged clothes, shining the oversized shoes of Ronald McDonald. The sculpture was unveiled in Queens but moved outside a different McDonald&#x27;s around the city every day. Other works included a YouTube video showing what appears to be footage of jihadist militants shooting down an animated Dumbo; travelling installations that toured the city including a slaughterhouse delivery truck full of stuffed animals and a waterfall; and a modified painting donated to a charity shop which was later sold in an online auction for $615,000. Banksy also posted a mock-up of a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed attacking the design of the One World Trade Center after the &quot;Times&quot; rejected his submission. The residency in New York concluded on 31 October 2013; many of the pieces, though, were either vandalised, removed or stolen.

=== 2015–2018 ===
In February 2015 Banksy published a 2-minute video titled &quot;Make this the year YOU discover a new destination&quot; about his trip to the Gaza Strip. During the visit, he painted a few artworks including a kitten on the remains of a house destroyed by an Israeli air strike (&quot;I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website—but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens&quot;) and a swing hanging off a watchtower. In a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot; his publicist said,

Banksy opened Dismaland, a large-scale group show modelled on Disneyland on 21 August 2015. It lampooned the many disappointing temporary themed attractions in the UK at the time. Dismaland permanently closed on 27 September 2015. The &quot;theme park&quot; was located in Weston-super-Mare, United Kingdom. According to the Dismaland website, artists represented on the show include Damien Hirst and Jenny Holzer. In December, Banksy created several murals in the vicinity of Calais, France, including the so-called &quot;Jungle&quot; where migrants then lived as they attempted to enter the United Kingdom. One of the pieces, &quot;The Son of a Migrant from Syria&quot;, depicts Steve Jobs as a migrant.

In 2017, marking the 100th anniversary of the British control of Palestine, Banksy financed the creation of the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem. This hotel is open to the public and contains rooms designed by Banksy, Sami Musa, and Dominique Petrin, and each of the bedrooms faces the wall. It also houses a contemporary art gallery. 2018 saw Banksy return to New York five years after his &quot;Better Out Than In&quot; residency. A trademark rat running around the circumference of a clock-face, dubbed &quot;Rat race&quot;, was torn down by developers within a week of it appearing on a former bank building at 101 West 14th Street, but other works, including a mural of imprisoned Kurdish artist Zehra Doğan on the famed Bowery Wall and a series of others across Brooklyn, remain on display.

==== &quot;Love is in the Bin&quot; (2018) ====
In October 2018, a Banksy work, initially titled the &quot;Balloon Girl&quot;, was sold for £1m at London auction house Sotheby&#x27;s. The purchaser of the work was an unnamed European woman. As the gavel hit the sound-block, an alarm sounded within the picture frame and the Banksy canvas passed through a shredder hidden within the frame, partially shredding the picture. Banksy then posted an image of the shredding on Instagram captioned &quot;Going, going, gone...&quot;. After the sale, the auction house acknowledged that the self-destruction of the work was a prank by the artist. The prank received wide news coverage around the world, with one newspaper stating that it was &quot;quite possibly the biggest prank in art history&quot;. Joey Syer, co-founder of an online platform facilitating art dealer sales, told the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;: &quot;The auction result will only propel this further and given the media attention this stunt has received, the lucky buyer would see a great return on the £1m they paid last night, this is now part of art history in its shredded state and we&#x27;d estimate Banksy has added a minimum of 50% to its value, possibly as high as being worth £2m+.&quot; A man seen filming the shredding of the picture during its auction has been suggested to be Banksy. Banksy has since released a video on how the shredder was installed into the frame and the shredding of the picture, explaining that he had surreptitiously fitted the painting with the shredder a few years previously, in case it ever went up for auction. To explain his rationale for destroying his own artwork, Banksy quoted Picasso: &quot;The urge to destroy is also a creative urge&quot;. (Although Banksy cited Picasso, this quote is usually attributed to Mikhail Bakunin.) It is not known how the shredder was activated. Banksy has released another video indicating that the painting was intended to be shredded completely. The video shows a sample painting completely shredded by the frame and says: &quot;In rehearsals it worked every time...&quot;

The woman who won the bidding at the auction decided to go through with the purchase. The partially shredded work has been given a new title, &quot;Love is in the Bin&quot;, and it was authenticated by Banksy&#x27;s authentication body, Pest Control Office Ltd. Sotheby&#x27;s released a statement that said &quot;Banksy didn&#x27;t destroy an artwork in the auction, he created one&quot;, and called it &quot;the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction&quot;. On 14 October 2021, the remains of the partially-shredded painting was reported by The Guardian to have been re-sold by Sotheby&#x27;s auction house, for £18,582,000, in London.

=== 2018–2019 ===

A two-sided graffiti piece, one side depicting a child tasting the falling snow, the other revealing that the snow is in fact smoke and embers from a dumpster fire, appeared on two walls of a steelworker&#x27;s garage in Port Talbot in December. Banksy then revealed that the painting was in fact his via an Instagram video soundtracked by the festive children&#x27;s song &quot;Little Snowflake&quot;. Many fans of the artist went to see the painting and Plaid Cymru councillor for Aberavon, Nigel Thomas Hunt, stated that the town was &quot;buzzing&quot; with speculation that the work was Banksy&#x27;s. The owner of the garage, Ian Lewis, said that he had lost sleep over fears that the image would be vandalised. A plastic screen, partially funded by Michael Sheen, was installed to protect the mural, but was attacked by a &quot;drunk halfwit&quot;. Extra security guards were subsequently drafted to protect the graffiti piece. In May 2019, the mural was moved to a gallery in the town&#x27;s Ty&#x27;r Orsaf building.

In early October 2019, Banksy opened a &quot;pop-up shop&quot; named &quot;Gross Domestic Product&quot; in Croydon, South London to strengthen his position in a trademark dispute with a greeting card company that had challenged his trademark on the grounds that he was not using it. In a statement, Banksy said &quot;A [greeting card] company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art, and attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally.&quot; Mark Stephens, arts lawyer and founder of the Design and Artists Copyright Society, called the case a &quot;ludicrous litigation&quot; and is providing the artist legal advice. Stephens recommended opening the shop to Banksy on the grounds that it would show he is making use of his trademark, saying: &quot;Because [Banksy] doesn&#x27;t produce his own range of shoddy merchandise and the law is quite clear—if the trademark holder is not using the mark, then it can be transferred to someone who will.&quot; On 4 October, greeting card distributor Full Colour Black publicly revealed itself as the company involved in the trademark dispute whilst rejecting Banksy&#x27;s claims as &quot;entirely untrue&quot;. The company claimed it had contacted Banksy&#x27;s lawyers several times to offer to pay royalties.

On 14 September 2020, the European Union Intellectual Property Office ruled in favour of Full Colour Black in the trademark dispute over Banksy&#x27;s infamous &quot;Flower Thrower&quot;. The European panel judges in &quot;Full Colour Black Ltd v Pest Control Office Ltd&quot; [2020] E.T.M.R. 58) decided that Banksy&#x27;s trademark was invalid as it had been filed in Bad Faith according to Regulation 2017/1001 art.59(1)(b). The judges were not convinced that the opening of the artist&#x27;s &quot;pop-up shop&quot; demonstrated a real intention to legitimise the trademark, condemning it as &quot;inconsistent with the honest practices of the trade&quot; [at 1141]. The artist&#x27;s choice to be represented anonymously was not received well by the court either, noting that even if they found in favour of Banksy, legal rights could not be attributed to an unidentifiable person [1151]. However, counsel for the defence strongly argued that to reveal his identity would diminish the persona of the artist [at 1135]. Although not binding, the judges also referenced Banksy&#x27;s previously critical statements about copyright, which contributed to the lack of sympathy for the artist&#x27;s case [at 1144].

In October 2019, a 2009 painting by Banksy entitled &quot;Devolved Parliament&quot;, showing Members of Parliament depicted as chimpanzees in the House of Commons, sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London for just under £9.9 million. On Instagram, the artist said it was a &quot;record price for a Banksy painting&quot; and &quot;shame I didn&#x27;t still own it&quot;. At wide it is Banksy&#x27;s biggest known work on canvas. The auction house stated: &quot;Regardless of where you sit in the Brexit debate, there&#x27;s no doubt that this work is more pertinent now than it has ever been.&quot;

=== 2020s ===
On 13 February 2020, the Valentine&#x27;s Banksy mural appeared on the side of a building in Bristol&#x27;s Barton Hill neighbourhood, depicting a young girl firing a slingshot of real red flowers and leaves. In the early hours of Valentine&#x27;s Day (14 February), Banksy confirmed this was his work on his Instagram account and website. The painting was defaced just days after appearing. Banksy dedicated a painting titled &quot;Painting for Saints&quot; or &quot;Game Changer&quot; to NHS staff, and donated it to the University Hospital of Southampton during the global coronavirus pandemic in May 2020. The painting was sold for £14.4m (£16.8m including buyer premium) on 23 March 2021, which is a record for an artwork by Banksy. The proceeds from the sale would benefit a number of NHS-related organisations and charities.

In March 2021, the image of an escaping prisoner appeared overnight on the side of Reading Prison. Two days later Banksy claimed the artwork. The former prison&#x27;s next use had been disputed locally, some wanting it to be used as an arts hub, while developers proposed it could be sold to a housing developer. The escaping prisoner was said to resemble Oscar Wilde, who had been imprisoned in Reading Prison, with the &quot;rope&quot; as tied together bedsheets with a typewriter attached to the end.

In August 2021, several Banksy artworks, collectively titled &quot;A Great British Spraycation&quot;, appeared in several East Anglian towns. Banksy created an original artwork for the 2021 BBC One/Amazon Prime Video comedy &quot;The Outlaws&quot;. The image of a stencilled rat sitting on two spray cans signed by Banksy featured in the sixth episode of the first series, and was painted over by the character Frank, played by Christopher Walken, while he was cleaning a graffiti-covered wall as part of his Community Payback sentence.

In November 2022, Banksy posted on social media images of a mural on the side of a damaged building at the town of Borodianka, appearing to confirm a visit to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. He also created six murals in Kyiv, Irpin, Hostomel and Horenka. One of the images he produced in Borodianka was of Russian president Vladimir Putin in a judo throw. The image has since been turned into a stamp in Ukraine.

Banksy was accused of being &quot;inconsistent with honest practices&quot; when trying to trademark his image of a protester throwing a bouquet of flowers. The European Union trademark office threw out his trademark claim, &quot;saying he had filed it in order to avoid using copyright laws, which are separate and would have required [him] to reveal his true identity. The ruling quoted from one of his books, in which he said &#x27;copyright is for losers&#x27;.&quot;

On St Patricks Day, 2024, a confirmed Banksy &quot;mural&quot; appeared overnight on a flank wall of a housing estate near to Finsbury Park. The artwork is located in an area known as Upper Holloway, in the London Borough of Islington. The mural is behind a stark heavily pruned tree, which dominates the foreground. The artwork&#x27;s green shades and leafy foliage used paint that matches Islington&#x27;s own municipal green, which is used on their housing estate nameplates. The sprawling artwork gives the impression of lush foliage in full leaf on the wall backdrop. An adjoining life size figure is stencilled onto the wall at ground level, showing a worker using a pressure washer, as if they were spontaneously spraying the artwork. One of the first to visit the Banksy, was the local MP, Jeremy Corbyn. Experts have speculated that the choice of subject and the location make it difficult to remove to sell at auction, as the context of the setting is everything and the sale value would be minimal.

In August 2024, he claimed credit for a number of black silhouette compositions, that appeared in London and were part of an animal-themed series. Various theories exist for what they mean and represent, with the artist himself declining to comment.

In February 2025, it was announced that Banksy, or a representee of the artist, is to appear at a tribunal at the U.K&#x27;s Intellectual Property Office. The tribunal will be one of the few times that the secretive artist’s legal team - or those representing the artist -  will speak in public.

== Other artworks ==
Banksy has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile artworks, including the following:
* At London Zoo, he climbed into the penguin enclosure and painted &quot;We&#x27;re bored of fish&quot; in letters.
* At London Zoo, he left the message &quot;I want out. This place is too cold. Keeper smells. Boring, boring, boring.&quot; in the elephant enclosure.
* In 2004, he placed the piece &quot;Banksus Militus Ratus&quot; into London&#x27;s Natural History Museum. 
* In March 2005, he placed subverted artworks in the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan as well as the Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn.
* In May 2005 Banksy&#x27;s version of a primitive cave painting depicting a human figure hunting wildlife while pushing a shopping trolley was hung in gallery 49 of the British Museum, London.
* In August 2005, Banksy painted nine images on the Israeli West Bank barrier, including an image of a ladder going up and over the wall and an image of children digging a hole through the wall.
* In October 2005, Banksy designed six station IDs for Nickelodeon.
* In April 2006, Banksy created a sculpture based on a crumpled red phone box with a pickaxe in its side, apparently bleeding, and placed it in a side street in Soho, London. It was later removed by Westminster Council.
* In June 2006, Banksy created &quot;Well Hung Lover&quot;, an image of a naked man hanging out of a bedroom window on a wall visible from Park Street in central Bristol. The image sparked &quot;a heated debate&quot;, with the Bristol City Council leaving it up to the public to decide whether it should stay or go. After an internet discussion in which 97% of the 500 people surveyed supported the stencil, the city council decided it would be left on the building. The mural was later defaced with blue paint.
* In August/September 2006, Banksy placed up to 500 copies of Paris Hilton&#x27;s debut CD, &quot;Paris&quot;, in 48 different UK record stores with his own cover art and remixes by Danger Mouse. Music tracks were given titles such as &quot;Why Am I Famous?&quot;, &quot;What Have I Done?&quot; and &quot;What Am I For?&quot;. Several copies of the CD were purchased by the public before stores were able to remove them, some going on to be sold for as much as £750 on online auction websites such as eBay. The cover art depicted Hilton digitally altered to appear topless. Other pictures feature her with her chihuahua Tinkerbell&#x27;s head replacing her own, and one of her stepping out of a luxury car, edited to include a group of homeless people, which included the caption &quot;90% of success is just showing up.&quot;
* In September 2006, Banksy dressed an inflatable doll in the manner of a Guantanamo Bay detainment camp prisoner (orange jumpsuit, black hood, and handcuffs) and then placed the figure within the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California.
* He makes stickers (the Neighbourhood Watch subvert) and was responsible for the cover art of Blur&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Think Tank&quot;.
* In September 2007, Banksy covered a wall in Portobello Road with a French artist painting graffiti of Banksy&#x27;s name.
*A guard/police officer with a balloon animal was painted in the Canadian city of Toronto in 2010, and has since been removed from its original location and preserved.
* In July 2012, in the run up to the London 2012 Olympic games he created several pieces based upon this event. One included an image of an athlete throwing a missile instead of a javelin, evidently taking a poke at the surface to air missile sites positioned in the Stratford area to defend the games.
* In April 2014, he created a piece in Cheltenham, near the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) headquarters, which depicts three men wearing sunglasses and using listening devices to &quot;snoop&quot; on a telephone box, evidently criticising the recent global surveillance disclosures of 2013. This was only confirmed by Banksy as his work later in June 2014. This piece &#x27;disappeared&#x27; on 20 August 2016 during renovations to the building it was on, and may have been destroyed.
* In October 2014, Ten days before the 2014 Clacton by-election, Banksy painted a mural on a wall in Clacton which showed five grey pigeons holding three placards. They held the words &quot;go back to Africa&quot; &quot;migrants not welcome&quot;, and &quot;keep off our worms&quot;. They were directed towards a more colourful migratory swallow perched further along the same wire. The mural was removed by Tendring District Council who had received a complaint that &quot;offensive and racist remarks&quot; had appeared on a wall.
* In June 2016, a 14 ft painting of a child with a stick chasing a burning tyre was found in the Bridge Farm Primary School in Bristol with a letter from Banksy thanking the school for naming one of its houses after him. BBC News reported that a spokesman for Banksy confirmed that the artwork was genuine. In the letter, Banksy wrote that if the members of the school did not like the painting, they should add their own elements.
* In May 2017, Banksy claimed the authorship of a giant Brexit mural, painted on a house in Dover (Kent).
* Banksy&#x27;s &quot;Dream Boat&quot;, originally made for the Dismaland exhibition, was donated to the NGO Help Refugees (now called Choose Love) to help raise funds for the charity. The artwork was displayed in Help Refugees&#x27; London Choose Love pop-up shop in the run-up to Christmas 2018, and members of the public could pay £2.00 to enter a competition to guess the weight of the piece. The person with the closest guess would win &quot;Dream Boat&quot;. The &#x27;guess-the-weight&#x27; competition was seen as &#x27;deliberately school fair&#x27; in style.

=== Damaged artwork ===

Many artworks by Banksy have been vandalised, painted over or destroyed.

In 2008, in Melbourne, paint was poured over a stencil of an old-fashioned diver wearing a trench coat. In April 2010, the Melbourne City Council reported that they had inadvertently ordered private contractors to paint over a rat descending in a parachute adorning the wall of an old council building behind the Forum Theatre.

In July 2011 one of Banksy&#x27;s early works, &quot;Gorilla in a Pink Mask&quot;, was unwittingly painted over after the premises became a Muslim cultural centre. The art piece had been a prominent landmark on the exterior wall of a former social club in Eastville for over ten years.

Many works that make up the &quot;Better Out Than In&quot; series in New York City have been defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one defacement was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy&#x27;s red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy&#x27;s work in May 2010.

In the case of the 2013 vandalism of Banksy&#x27;s &quot;Praying Boy&quot; in Park City, Utah, United States,
the perpetrator was tried, pled guilty, and convicted of criminal mischief.
The artwork was restored to its original state by a painting conservator, who was hired by the owners of the building where &quot;Praying Boy&quot; is located.

== Technique ==
Because of the secretive nature of Banksy&#x27;s work and identity, it is uncertain what techniques he uses to generate the images in the stencils, though it is assumed he uses computers for some images due to the photographic quality of much of his work. He mentions in his book &quot;Wall and Piece&quot; that as he was starting to do graffiti, he was always either caught or could never finish the art in one sitting. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number. He then devised a series of intricate stencils for minimising time and overlapping of the colour.

In a 2003 interview, Banksy described his technique, when making a piece in a public area, as &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;I want to get it done and dusted.&quot;

There exists a debate about the influence behind his work. Some critics claim Banksy was influenced by musician and graffiti artist 3D. Another source credits the artist&#x27;s work to resemble that of French graffiti artist Blek le Rat. It is said that Banksy was inspired by their use of stencils, later taking this visual style and transforming it through modern political and social pieces.

Banksy&#x27;s stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans. The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist or anti-establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly.

In the broader art world, stencils are traditionally hand drawn or printed onto sheets of acetate or card, before being cut out by hand. This technique allows artists to paint quickly to protect their anonymity. There is dispute in the street art world over the legitimacy of stencils, with many artists criticising their use as &quot;cheating&quot;.

In 2018, Banksy created a piece live as it was being auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s. The piece originally consisted of a framed painting of &quot;Girl with Balloon&quot;. While the bidding was in progress, a shredder was activated from within the frame, partially destroying the painting, and thus creating a new piece. The shredder had been pre-emptively built into the frame a few years prior in case the painting was put up for auction.
The new artwork, consisting of the half-shredded painting still in its frame, is titled &quot;Love is in the Bin&quot;.

In 2025, the BBC unearthed previously unseen Banksy murals that differ in their execution from the well-known stencil style of graffiti for which the artist is commonly known. The murals created for an in a youth club in the artist&#x27;s home city, are examples of the early technique of the artist.

== Political and social themes ==
Banksy once characterised graffiti as a form of underclass &quot;revenge&quot;, or guerrilla warfare that allows an individual to snatch away power, territory and glory from a bigger and better equipped enemy. Banksy sees a social class component to this struggle, remarking &quot;If you don&#x27;t own a train company then you go and paint on one instead.&quot; Banksy&#x27;s work has also shown a desire to mock centralised power, hoping that their work will show the public that although power does exist and works against you, that power is not terribly efficient and it can and should be deceived.

Banksy&#x27;s works have dealt with various political and social themes, including anti-war, anti-consumerism, anti-fascism, anti-imperialism, anti-authoritarianism, anarchism, nihilism, and existentialism. Additionally, the components of the human condition that his works commonly critique are greed, poverty, hypocrisy, boredom, despair, absurdity, and alienation. Although Banksy&#x27;s works usually rely on visual imagery and iconography to put forth their message, Banksy has made several politically related comments in various books. In summarising his list of &quot;people who should be shot&quot;, he listed &quot;Fascist thugs, religious fundamentalists, (and) people who write lists telling you who should be shot.&quot; While facetiously describing his political nature, Banksy declared that &quot;Sometimes I feel so sick at the state of the world, I can&#x27;t even finish my second apple pie.&quot;

Banksy&#x27;s work has also critiqued the environmental impacts of big businesses. When speaking about his 2005 work &quot;Show me the Monet&quot;, Banksy explained:

&quot;Show me the Monet&quot; repurposes Claude Monet&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies&quot;, with the inclusion of two shopping carts and an orange traffic cone. This painting was later sold for £7.5 million at Sotheby&#x27;s Contemporary Evening Auction in 2020.

During the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Banksy offered voters a free print if they cast a ballot against the Conservative candidates standing in the Bristol North West, Bristol West, North Somerset, Thornbury, Kingswood and Filton constituencies. According to a note posted on Banksy&#x27;s website, an emailed photo of a completed ballot paper showing it marked for a candidate other than the Conservative candidate would result in the voter being mailed a limited edition piece of Banksy art. On 5 June 2017 the Avon and Somerset Constabulary announced it had opened an investigation into Banksy for the suspected corrupt practice of bribery, and the following day Banksy withdrew the offer stating &quot;I have been warned by the Electoral Commission that the free print offer will invalidate the election result. So I regret to announce that this ill-conceived and legally dubious promotion has now been cancelled.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Banksy referenced medical advice to self-isolate by creating an artwork in his bathroom.

==Philanthropy and activism==
Banksy has donated a number of works to promote various causes, such as &quot;Civilian Drone Strike&quot;, which was sold in 2017 at £205,000 to raise funds for Campaign Against Arms Trade and Reprieve. It was part of the exhibition &quot;Art the Arms Fair&quot; set up in opposition to the DSEI arms fair. In 2018, a sculpture titled &quot;Dream Boat&quot;, which was exhibited in Dismaland in 2015, was raffled off in aid of the NGO Help Refugees (now called Choose Love) for a minimum donation of £2 for every guesses of its weight in a pop-up Choose Love shop in Carnaby Street. In 2002, he produced artwork for the Greenpeace campaign Save or Delete. He also provided works to support local causes; in 2013, a work titled &quot;The Banality of the Banality of Evil&quot; was sold for an undisclosed amount after a failed auction to support an anti-homelessness charity in New York. In 2014, an artwork on a doorway titled &quot;Mobile Lovers&quot; was sold £403,000 to keep a youth club in Bristol open, and he created merchandise for homeless charities in Bristol in 2019.

Banksy has been producing a number of works and projects in support of the Palestinians since the mid-2000s, including The Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem.
In July 2020, Banksy sold three paintings forming a triptych titled &quot;Mediterranean Sea View 2017&quot;, which raised £2.2 million for a hospital in Bethlehem. The paintings were original created for The Walled Off Hotel, and are Romantic-era paintings of the seashore that have been modified with images of lifebuoys and orange life jackets washed up on the shore, a reference to the European migrant crisis.

Banksy gifted a painting titled &quot;Game Changer&quot; to a hospital in May 2020 as a tribute to National Health Service workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was later sold for £14.4m in March 2021 to benefit a number of NHS-related organisations and charities.

In August 2020, it was revealed that Banksy had privately funded a rescue boat to save refugees at risk in the Mediterranean Sea. The former French Navy boat, renamed after Louise Michel, has been painted pink with an image of a young girl holding a heart-shaped safety float.

== Books ==
Banksy has published several books that contain photographs of his work accompanied by his own writings:
* &quot;Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall&quot; (2001). .
* &quot;Existencilism&quot; (2002). .
* &quot;Cut It Out&quot; (2004). .
* &quot;Pictures of Walls&quot; (2005). .
* &quot;Wall and Piece&quot; (2007). .
* &quot;You Are an Acceptable Level of Threat and if You Were Not You Would Know It (2012)&quot;

&quot;Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall&quot;, &quot;Existencilism&quot;, and &quot;Cut It Out&quot; were a three-part self-published series of small booklets.

&quot;Pictures of Walls&quot; is a compilation book of pictures of the work of other graffiti artists, curated and self-published by Banksy. None of them are still in print, or were ever printed in any significant number.

Banksy&#x27;s &quot;Wall and Piece&quot; compiled large parts of the images and writings in his original three-book series, with heavy editing and some new material. It was intended for mass print, and published by Random House.

The writings in his original three books had numerous grammatical errors, and his writings in them often took a dark, and angry, and a (self-described) paranoid tone. While the content in them was almost entirely kept in &quot;Wall and Piece&quot;, the stories were edited and generally took a less provocative tone, and the grammatical errors were resolved (presumably to make it suitable for mass market distribution).

<doc id="396243" wikidata="Q7966695" url="?curid=396243" title="Walton, Aylesbury">
<text>Walton (perhaps formerly known as Walcot) is a hamlet in the parish of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, England. Although Aylesbury has grown to such an extent that it completely surrounds Walton by a couple of miles in each direction, the hamlet is still marked on modern maps.

Walton sits north of the junction between two major turnpike roads, and was once the location of a toll gate and the toll keeper&#x27;s cottage. It has also, in its time, been the location of a foundlings hospital and a leper colony.

==History==
The hamlet name is a common one in England. It is Anglo Saxon in origin and either means &quot;Walled Settlement&quot; or &quot;Settlement of the Walhs&quot;, the word &#x27;walh&#x27; being an Old English word for Briton. There is evidence that there has been a settlement in Walton since the Roman occupation of England where remains of a Romano-British villa have been found. There were also known to be Saxon houses in the vicinity of Walton in the 5th century.

The manor house in Walton was called Walton Court, and was a wattle and daub structure that was stockaded and moated and situated across the road of what is now Walton Terrace. It was throughout most of its history owned by the Church, and revenue from the manor went to Lincoln Cathedral (it was mentioned in a charter to the cathedral by King William II). It was owned privately for a brief period in the mid 17th century but was subsequently returned to the Church following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The principal crop of the manorial farm was rushing used in thatching. The manor should not be confused with Walton Court, the modern housing estate of the same name, which is in a completely different location.

Towards the middle of the 19th century Walton became the local centre for breeding the Aylesbury duck with Walton Pond being a congregating point for many of the local flocks.

The stone-built Holy Trinity Church in Walton opened in 1845 to provide a local place of worship for the farm labourers who lived in the hamlet, and canal workers from the newly built 1814 Aylesbury arm of the Grand Union canal. A hall was built in 1859 next door to the church to start what was to become Walton Holy Trinity National School (now Walton Hall) to support and educate local children. Walton Hall has always been both independent from and also supported by members of Holy Trinity and has been a focus of local community life from its beginnings in 1859. The vicar of Holy Trinity from 1937 to 1949 was the Rev. Brian Hession.

In the Second World War Walton was the landing site of the only bomb to be dropped on Aylesbury by enemy aircraft. The 15-pound bomb destroyed the medieval Walton Grange and severely damaged most of the other houses in Walton. Walton Grange&#x27;s garden wall still remains though the property now forms part of Aylesbury High School.

==Modern Walton==
Today the hamlet keeps a strong identity in the town, with the roads of Walton Street, Walton Road, Walton Grove, Walton Way, Walton Dene and Walton Green all being in the vicinity of the hamlet, and other landmarks such as the Georgian Walton Lodge and the old village pond (Bigg&#x27;s pond) still remaining. The hamlet is also the location of Aylesbury&#x27;s Police Station and Aylesbury Grammar School, as well as the aforementioned High School.
There are four pubs in the vicinity, The Aristocrat, The Bricklayers Arms, The Broad Leys and The Millwrights. There is currently an Indian Restaurant called Shensha on Stoke Road which was formerly a fifth public house. There was also a public house just outside the area to the south called The Three Pigeons, which was demolished to make way for housing. It was at this public house that the two turnpike roads met originally, before the northern one was rerouted.

==William Harding&#x27;s Charity==
William Harding (1643 – 1718) was a yeoman from the hamlet of Walton who left a trust in his will to clothe and educate the children of the poor from the local area. The charity was founded after the will was proved in 1719 with the aim of:
* Providing forty shillings a year to buy coats for the poor men and women of Walton
* To select children of poor parents in Aylesbury and Walton to be given apprenticeships
* To clothe those same children
The charity still exists and is managed by the trustees, the clerk of which is a partner of Parrott and Coales LLP Solicitors in Aylesbury. It now makes grants for any educational purpose for young people from the Aylesbury area.

The William Harding Combined School in Elm Farm is named after him.

<text>Suzanne Tremblay (; January 24, 1937 – September 26, 2020) was a Canadian politician from Quebec who served as a Bloc Québécois member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2004.

==Early life==
Born in Montreal, Tremblay received a Queen Elizabeth II Scholarship to attend Tufts University in the United States, where she earned a Master&#x27;s degree in pre-school education. She then completed a certificate in educational studies at the Université de Lyon and a certificate in child care studies at the University of London.

==Political career==
Tremblay was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1993 federal election for the riding of Rimouski—Témiscouata. She was re-elected in the 1997 election for the riding of Rimouski-Mitis and in the 2000 election for Rimouski-Neigette-et-La Mitis. She announced her intention not to run again in the 2004 federal election.

She was occasionally a controversial figure, once pointing out that Quebec Premier Jean Charest&#x27;s first name was really &quot;John&quot; in an attempt to discredit him as a representative of the true Quebec; the Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe distanced himself from this comment. Tremblay also made similar comments attacking Radio-Canada journalist Joyce Napier for not having a francophone name, and pop singer Céline Dion for purportedly turning her back on her Québécoise identity in her pursuit of pop stardom.

Following Tremblay&#x27;s announcement of her retirement from the House of Commons, Louise Thibault, a municipal councillor in Le Bic, became the Bloc Québécois candidate in the new riding of Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, and won the 2004 election. Tremblay ran in the resulting by-election to fill Thibault&#x27;s municipal council seat, running primarily on a campaign of opposing the then-proposed amalgamation of Le Bic with Rimouski. She lost narrowly to Pierre Garon, a local farmer and trucker who had not previously been active in politics.

==Death==
Tremblay died on September 26, 2020, from cancer.

<text>La Plata () is the capital city of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. According to the 2022 census, the Partido has a population of 772,618 and its metropolitan area, the Greater La Plata, has 938,287 inhabitants. It is located 9 kilometers (6 miles) inland from the southern shore of the estuary.

La Plata was planned and developed to serve as the provincial capital after the city of Buenos Aires was federalized in 1880. It was officially founded by Governor Dardo Rocha on 19 November 1882. Its construction is fully documented in photographs by Tomás Bradley Sutton. La Plata was briefly known as &quot;Ciudad Eva Perón&quot; (Eva Perón City) between 1952 and 1955.

==History and description==

After La Plata was designated the provincial capital, Rocha was placed in charge of creating the city. He hired urban planner Pedro Benoit, who designed a city layout based on a rationalist conception of urban centers. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north to south and east to west. In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonal streets. This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. For every six blocks, there is a small park or square. Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. Thus, La Plata is nicknamed &quot;la ciudad de las diagonales&quot; (city of diagonals). It is also called &quot;la ciudad de los tilos&quot; (city of linden trees), because of the large number of linden trees lining the many streets and squares. The linden tree is one of a number of deciduous Northern Hemisphere tree species which dominate La Plata&#x27;s parks and streets; ash, horsechestnut, plane, sweetgum and tulip tree are among the other examples. Palms and subtropical broadleaf evergreen trees thrive but are comparatively infrequent.

The city design and its buildings are noted to possess strong Freemason symbolism as a consequence of both Rocha and Benoit being Freemasons.

The designs for the government buildings were chosen in an international architectural competition. Thus, the Governor Palace was designed by Italians, the City Hall by Germans, etc. Electric street lighting was installed in 1884 and was the first of its kind in Latin America.

=== Important landmarks ===

The neo-Gothic cathedral of La Plata is the largest church in Argentina. It is located on the central park, Plaza Moreno, and is the 58th tallest church in the world.

The Teatro Argentino de La Plata is one of the most important opera houses in Argentina, second to the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. The construction was funded by the first inhabitants of La Plata, but as maintenance was very expensive it was later donated to the Province of Buenos Aires. On 18 October 1977, the building was almost completely destroyed by a fire. This has been noted as one of the largest losses to La Plata&#x27;s historical heritage. It was later replaced by a new building, which houses the theatre&#x27;s orchestra, choir and ballet, boasting several halls.
The Curutchet House is one of the two buildings by Le Corbusier built in the Americas.

The University of La Plata was founded in 1897 and nationalized in 1905. It is well known for its observatory and natural history museum. Ernesto Sabato graduated in Physics at this university; he went on to teach at the Sorbonne and the MIT before becoming a famed novelist. Doctor René Favaloro was another famous alumnus. During its early years, the university attracted a number of intellectuals from the Spanish-speaking world, such as Dominican Pedro Henríquez Ureña.

 is on the corner of 48th and 5th Streets. It was the first chapel in La Plata and Pedro Benoit himself drew up the plans for the church. It was inaugurated on 19 November 1883, the first anniversary of the foundation of the city. Its neo-Gothic style has been well kept, and the inner paintings are now being restored. Then-governor Rocha was the one to name it &quot;San Ponciano&quot;. This was both in memory of his son Ponciano and in honor of Pope Pontian. Inside the church is the &quot;Virgen de Luján&quot; niche, which was moved here in 1904.

=== La Plata in the 20th century ===
Under Alvear&#x27;s administration (1922–1928), Enrique Mosconi, the president of the state oil company &quot;Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales&quot;, created the La Plata distillery, at the time the tenth largest in the world.
On 10 December 1945, in the Parish church of St. Francis of Assisi in this city, Juan Domingo Perón and Eva Duarte were married.

In 1952, the city was renamed Ciudad Eva Perón; its original name was restored in 1955.

In March 1976, the Argentine military seized power following a coup d&#x27;état, which involved the disappearance of a number of students from La Plata. The military junta had implemented what was called the National Reorganization Process which was a set of policies used by the regime to destroy left-wing guerrilla forces and oppress resistance to its rule. The process included kidnappings, torture and murder. Meanwhile, the Montoneros, a leftist guerilla group, responded violently to the junta and its actions as they enlisted other Argentines to join their campaign against the regime. Those enlisted included young, left-wing, politically active students from the organization named the &quot;Unión de Estudiantes Secundarios&quot; (Union of High School Students) of La Plata. The UES was committed to achieving school reforms and other political reforms through demonstrations and protests that irked the ruling regime. Many of these students were kidnapped and killed (many remain as &#x27;desaparecidos&#x27;) as part of the state&#x27;s terrorism during the dictatorship.

In October 1998, UNESCO approved the city&#x27;s bid to gain recognition as a World Heritage site. The approval is still pending due to various objections to the criterion of maintaining architectural and landscape features during recent decades, which in the opinion of other specialists, has caused severe damage to the original design and contextual aesthetics.

=== Sports and stadiums ===
The city is home to two important first division football teams: Estudiantes de La Plata and Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata.

Estudiantes de La Plata is the most successful club in the city, having won seven national tournaments, four Copa Libertadores and the Intercontinental Cup against the Manchester United in 1968. It is the origin of several symbols of Argentine football such as Osvaldo Zubeldía, Carlos Bilardo, Alejandro Sabella, Juan Ramón and Juan Sebastián Verón. Estudiantes has had a great influence on the Argentine National Team, mainly through Bilardo in the 1986 World Cup. Its successes and its style of play, normally called bilardismo, have placed it in the position of exponent of a football style deeply rooted in the country.

For its part, Gimnasia de La Plata, founded in 1887, has not obtained titles in the professional era, but it is a traditional First Division club.

The Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, also known as the &quot;Estadio Único&quot;, opened on 7 June 2003, as one of the most modern football stadiums in Latin America. Various other construction and renovation projects have continued, including the addition of a roof structure. Estudiantes played in the new stadium from 2006 to 2019 while their own stadium was being modernized; Estudiantes returned to its traditional home ground of Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium in 2019. Gimnasia La Plata has only played occasional home games in the Estadio Único. In 2011, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata was one of the host sites for the 2011 Copa America including an opening-round match between Argentina and Bolivia, a semi-final game, and the third-place final. Now, the stadium is additionally used for concerts and Puma matches.

Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium, the home ground of Estudiantes, is located on 1st Avenue in La Plata. Estadio Juan Carmelo Zerillo, the home ground of Gimnasia La Plata, is located in a park known as El Bosque.

During 2009, following a series of agreements between the city municipality, the governor of the province and the nation&#x27;s presidency, progress was made in the final transfer of the land of the Paseo del Bosque to Estudiantes and Gimnasia La Plata clubs. On 24 June 2009, the Deliberative Council adopted the convention and the ordinance for which Gimnasia and Estudiantes clubs received &quot;grants&quot; for the lands on which their home grounds are currently located within El Bosque (The Forest).

==City layout and architecture==



La Plata is a planned city, characterized by a strict grid of square blocks, with diagonal avenues running across. The two major diagonals, 73 and 74, go across the city from east to west and from north to south, respectively, and converge right in the city&#x27;s center at Plaza Moreno. This square houses the so-called &quot;foundation stone&quot; and is the main square of the city. To its sides are located the City Hall and the cathedral of La Plata. Highlights of the city are the Museum of Natural Sciences, the building of the Interior, the Provincial Legislature, the new theater and the hippodrome. Many of these buildings were built at the time of the founding of the city, following an international call for proposals.

Another work is the parent company of &quot;Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires&quot;, located between the streets 6, 7, 46 and 47. This building was designed by architects Juan A. Buschiazzo and Luis Viglione. It opened on 19 April 1886, being amended in 1913 and in the 1970s.

It is a very green city, with its largest park being the &quot;Paseo del Bosque&quot; (or simply &#x27;the forest&#x27;). Twenty-two other parks and squares contain much of the city&#x27;s trees and greenery. Other landmarks include the lake, the Martin Fierro amphitheater, the Parque Pereyra Iraola, the Zoo and Botanical Garden, the Victorian astronomical observatory, and the Natural History Museum. One notable attraction is the Children&#x27;s Republic, which is said to have inspired Walt Disney to build Disneyland after he visited it during a trip to Argentina.

In 1977 the city lost one of its most valuable monuments to a fire: the Teatro Argentino de La Plata, predominantly built in a neoclassic style. After the fire, a new brutalist style theater was built in its place. The Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, a stadium influenced by modern high-tech architecture, is located in the city. It was planned and built after a national competition during the 1970s. The stadium received repairs and amendments in a subsequent project to expand its capacity, and also to rebuild the roof in sectors that had been destroyed by storms. The construction of a semitransparent deck of Kevlar and plastic resins was finished in January 2011.

La Plata has one commercial airport, Aeropuerto de La Plata, which is not served by any airlines.

===Awards received by the city===
The city was awarded at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, an event in which the new city was given the two gold medals awarded in the categories &quot;City of the Future&quot; and &quot;Better performance built.&quot; At that event, Jules Verne gave the award to Dardo Rocha

===La Plata Cemetery===

The municipal cemetery of La Plata was established in 1886 for the new capital of the province of Buenos Aires. It was designed by Pedro Benoit. It lies on the intersection of Avenue 31, 72 and diagonal 74 in the southern tip. It has some remarkable architectural features, both in its main entrance and in many of the family vaults, including neoclassical, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau (in its variant of Catalan Art Nouveau), Art Deco and Egyptian revival styles. The main entrance is an impressive neo-classical portico with Doric columns. The Catholic chapel, in Romanesque revival style, was finished in 1950. Diagonal 74 begins at the Río de la Plata and ends at the cemetery, causing some to remark that the layout may have been intentional symbolism of the cycle of life and death by Benoit.

Its annex, the Jewish Cemetery, belongs to the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina in La Plata and is located on Avenue 72.

==Sports==
The main football teams in the city are Estudiantes de La Plata (locally known as &quot;pinchas&quot;), winners of the Intercontinental Cup in 1968, and Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, both of which currently play in the Argentina&#x27;s first division. Estudiantes is the sole team within the city to win a national or international title. La Plata has Liga Amateur Platense de fútbol that encompasses various clubs in the region, such as Club Atlético Estrella de Berisso, La Plata FC, Asociación Nueva Alianza, and Club Everton.

<text>The Improved Order of Red Men is a fraternal organization established in North America in 1834. It claims direct descent from the colonial era Sons of Liberty. Their rituals and regalia are modeled after those assumed by men of the era to be used by Native Americans. Despite the name, the order was formed solely by, and for, white men. This whites-only rule was part of their bylaws until 1974, when the all-white clause was eliminated. Their current position is that they are now open to people of all ethnic backgrounds. In 1935 the organization claimed a membership of about half a million but, by 2011, that declined to a little more than 15,000.

== History ==
On December 16, 1773, a group of colonists — all men, and members of the Sons of Liberty — met in Boston to protest the tax on tea imposed by England. When their protest went unheeded, they disguised themselves as their idea of Mohawk people, proceeded to Boston harbor, and dumped overboard 342 chests of English tea. (See Boston Tea Party.)

In the late 18th century, the Tammany Societies, named after Tamanend, were formed. The most well-known of these was New York City&#x27;s Society of St. Tammany, which grew into a major political machine known as &quot;Tammany Hall.&quot;

For the next 35 years, the original Sons of Liberty and the Sons of St. Tamina groups went their own way, under many different names.

Around 1813, a disenchanted group created the philanthropic &quot;Society of Red Men&quot; at historic Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia.

The organization grew in the 1820s. Parallel lines of advancement were offered in the Order of Red Men: a series of military titles and a set of “Indian rankings.”

Class and ethnic differences introduced by new immigrants, anti-Masonic persecutions, attacks on fraternal groups based on excessive drinking, and, ultimately, a widespread cholera epidemic in 1832 led to the decline of the organization.

In 1834, the Improved Order of Red Men (IORM) was started as a revival in Baltimore. It was focused on temperance, patriotism and American History. In 1835, with only two groups in place (called &quot;tribes&quot; by the IORM), a larger IORM was organized. Unlike the original Order, the IORM uses only expanded Native American titles. Rather than the public display of Native American costumes, the IORM uses its regalia in private gatherings.

In 1886, its membership requirements were defined in the same pseudo-Indigenous phrasing as the rest of the constitution:
In one 1886 &quot;tribe&quot;, a member&#x27;s 12 cent a week dues went into a fund which was used to pay disability benefits to members at a rate of about &quot;three fathoms per seven suns&quot; ($3/week) for up to &quot;six moons&quot; (6 months) and then two dollars a week. Some medical care (&quot;a suitable nurse&quot;) was available, and also a death benefit of one hundred dollars. The fund was invested in bonds, mortgages, and &quot;Building Association Stock&quot;. Meetings were held weekly on Friday nights.

== Organization ==
The Order has a three tiered structure. Local units are called &quot;tribes&quot; and are presided over by a &quot;Sachem&quot; and a board of directors. Local meeting sites are called &quot;Wigwams&quot;. The state level is called the &quot;Reservation&quot; and governed by a &quot;Great Sachem&quot; and &quot;Great Council&quot; or &quot;Board of Chiefs&quot;. The national level is the &quot;Great Council of the United States&quot;. The Great Council consists of the &quot;Great Incohonee&quot; (president), and a &quot;Board of Great Chiefs&quot;, which includes the &quot;Great Senior Sagamore&quot; (first vice-president), &quot;Great Junior Sagamore&quot;, &quot;Great Chief of Records&quot; (secretary), &quot;Great Keeper of the Wampum&quot; (treasurer) and &quot;Prophet&quot; (past president). The headquarters of the Order has been in Waco, Texas, since at least 1979. They maintain an official museum and library in Waco.

=== Auxiliaries and side degrees ===
A side degree of the order was founded in 1890 as the National Haymakers&#x27; Association. There was also once a uniformed division called the Knights of Tammany, as well as a group called the Chieftains League, which consisted of members who had been exalted to the Chief Degree (see below) and were in good standing within their respective &quot;tribes&quot;.

In 1952, the Order created the Degree of Hiawatha, as a youth auxiliary for males 8 and up. Most of the members of the Degree of Hiawatha were concentrated in New England. In 1979 there were less than 5,000 members in approximately 125 &quot;Councils&quot;.

The Order female auxiliary is the Degree of Pocahontas and dates to the 1880s and the Degree of Anona, a junior order of the Degree of Pocahontas, was formed in 1952.

== Membership ==
The Improved Order of the Red Men grew in membership in the late 19th century. It reached 519,942 members in forty-six states in 1921, but had declined to 31,789 in 32 states in 1978 and to 15,251 by 2011.

Until 1974, the Order was open to whites only. That year the 106th Great Council of the United States eliminated the all-white clause in what was called a &quot;turning point for the order&quot;. In the present-day, the Improved Order of Red Men is open to people of all ethnic backgrounds.

== Rituals ==
The order itself claims direct descent from the Sons of Liberty, noting that the Sons participated in the Boston Tea Party dressed as their idea of &quot;Indians&quot;. Thus, they continue to dress as &quot;Indians&quot; and use Native American terminology, despite being a non-Native organization.

The group&#x27;s ritual terminology is derived from language they believe is used by Native Americans, though it also shows the influence of Freemasonry. Outsiders are called &quot;Palefaces&quot;, to open a meeting is called &quot;kindling the fire&quot;, officers&#x27; installations are called &quot;Raising up of Chiefs&quot; and voting is called &quot;twigging&quot;. The Masonic influence is seen in the three basic degrees – Adoption, Warrior and Chief. There is also a fourth degree, Beneficiary, for insurance.

===Calendar system===
Originally, the society used the Hebrew &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; system for calendar year numbering when dating their documents, rather than &quot;Anno Domini&quot; (AD). In 1865 AD a new system was devised and adopted, known as the &quot;Great Sun of Discovery&quot; (GSD). The first year of the system, known as GSD 1, was the year that Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas, namely 1492 AD. In this system, years were known as &quot;great suns&quot; and months were called &quot;moons&quot;, each with their own epithet, e.g. &quot;Cold Moon&quot; for January, but the length of these years and months conformed to the conventional Gregorian calendar.

== Philanthropy and positions ==

The order has historically opposed federal welfare programs, waste in government and Communism. However, there are examples of substantial socialist participation in the organization in pockets of the United States; for example, in southern West Virginia, during the build up to the West Virginia Mine Wars, &quot;the Improved Order of Red Men [was] . . . the most comfortable lodge for Socialist miners and other radical workers.&quot;

After the Civil war in West Virginia, the Improved Order of Red Men became a fraternal organization of some notoriety for vigilante activity. The Red Men Act, West Virginia&#x27;s anti conspiracy law, was passed in response to a groundswell of such violence. Occasionally this vigilante activity included the use of red masks over their faces.

The IORM supported the founding of the Society of American Indians in 1911 and helped organize the SAI&#x27;s first two conferences.

== Offshoots ==
=== Independent Order of Red Men ===
In 1850, the German-language, &quot;Metamora Tribe of Baltimore&quot;, refused to pay a benefit, even though the Great Councils of Maryland and the United States decided that it was legal and proper for them to do so. The group then surrendered its charter and formed a new, German-speaking Independent Order of Red Men. It asked the other German-language groups (or Stamms) to join the new group, but few did so. The Independent Order had a height of 12,000 members, though in the 1880s many Stamms returned to the Improved Order. It still existed in 1896, but according to Albert C. Stevens it gave &quot;no sign of vigorous growth&quot;. In the early 1920s, Arthur Preuss could not get into contact with them, but felt it probably still existed.

=== Afro-American Order of Red Men ===
In 1904, another group called the Independent Order of Red Men emerged in Virginia, this time composed entirely of African Americans. When the Improved Order objected to the use of the name, the leader of the group, R. M. Spears, had the charter withdrawn and renamed the group the &quot;Afro-American Order of Red Men and Daughters of Pocahontas&quot;. The Virginia IORM still apparently considered an injunction against the new group, but it is unclear how the episode turned out. A Tribe #23 based in Metompkin, Virginia is attested by the existence of a ribbon badge in the collection of Theda Skocpol, suggesting that the group had at least 23 local &quot;tribes&quot; in the state. The badge is identical to the ones worn by the IORM, except with the AAORM initials.

<text>Wilderness or wildlands (usually in the plural) are Earth&#x27;s natural environments that have not been significantly modified by human activity, or any nonurbanized land not under extensive agricultural cultivation. The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on marine wilderness. Recent maps of wilderness suggest it covers roughly one-quarter of Earth&#x27;s terrestrial surface, but is being rapidly degraded by human activity. Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% free from intense human activity.

Some governments establish protection for wilderness areas by law to not only preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development. These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas. Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain species, biodiversity, ecological studies, conservation, solitude and recreation. They may also preserve historic genetic traits and provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories.

==History==

===Ancient times and Middle Ages===
From a visual arts perspective, nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history. An early tradition of landscape art occurred in the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature &quot;as it is&quot; became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art. Artists in the tradition of Shan shui (lit. &quot;mountain-water-picture&quot;), learned to depict mountains and rivers &quot;from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature… as if seen through the eyes of a bird&quot;. In the 13th century, Shih Erh Chi recommended avoiding painting &quot;scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature&quot;.

For most of human history, the greater part of Earth&#x27;s terrain was wilderness, and human attention was concentrated on settled areas. The first known laws to protect parts of nature date back to the Babylonian Empire and Chinese Empire. Ashoka, the Great Mauryan King, defined the first laws in the world to protect flora and fauna in Edicts of Ashoka around the 3rd century B.C. In the Middle Ages, the Kings of England initiated one of the world&#x27;s first conscious efforts to protect natural areas. They were motivated by a desire to be able to hunt wild animals in private hunting preserves rather than a desire to protect wilderness. Nevertheless, in order to have animals to hunt they would have to protect wildlife from subsistence hunting and the land from villagers gathering firewood. Similar measures were introduced in other European countries.

However, in European cultures, throughout the Middle Ages, wilderness generally was not regarded worth protecting but rather judged strongly negative as a dangerous place and as a moral counter-world to the realm of culture and godly life. &quot;While archaic nature religions oriented themselves towards nature, in medieval Christendom this orientation was replaced by one towards divine law. The divine was no longer to be found in nature; instead, uncultivated nature became a site of the sinister and the demonic. It was considered corrupted by the Fall (&quot;natura lapsa&quot;), becoming a vale of tears in which humans were doomed to live out their existence. Thus, for example, mountains were interpreted [e.g, by Thomas Burnet] as ruins of a once flat earth destroyed by the Flood, with the seas as the remains of that Flood.&quot; &quot;If paradise was early man&#x27;s greatest good, wilderness, as its antipode, was his greatest evil.&quot;

===15th to 19th century===
Wilderness was viewed by colonists as being evil in its resistance to their control. The puritanical view of wilderness meant that in order for colonists to be able to live in North America, they had to destroy the wilderness in order to make way for their &#x27;civilized&#x27; society. Wilderness was considered to be the root of the colonists&#x27; problems, so to make the problems go away, wilderness needed to be destroyed. One of the first steps in doing this, is to get rid of trees in order to clear the land. Military metaphors describing the wilderness as the &quot;enemy&quot; were used, and settler expansion was phrased as &quot;[conquering] the wilderness&quot;.

In relation to the wilderness, Native Americans were viewed as savages. The relationship between Native Americans and the land was something colonists did not understand and did not try to understand. This mutually beneficial relationship was different from how colonists viewed the land only in relation to how it could benefit themselves by waging a constant battle to beat the land and other living organisms into submission. The belief colonists had of the land being only something to be used was based in Christian ideas. If the earth and animals and plants were created by a Christian God for human use, then the cultivation by colonists was their God-given goal.

However, the idea that what European colonists saw upon arriving in North America was pristine and devoid of humans is untrue due to the existence of Native Americans. The land was shaped by Native Americans through practices such as fires. Burning happened frequently and in a controlled manner. The landscapes seen in the US today are very different from the way things looked before colonists came. Fire could be used to maintain food, cords, and baskets. One of the main roles of frequent fires was to prevent the out of control fires which are becoming more and more common.

The idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the Western world in the 19th century. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Prior to that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth&#x27;s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.

By the mid-19th century, in Germany, &quot;Scientific Conservation&quot;, as it was called, advocated &quot;the efficient utilization of natural resources through the application of science and technology&quot;. Concepts of forest management based on the German approach were applied in other parts of the world, but with varying degrees of success. Over the course of the 19th century wilderness became viewed not as a place to fear but a place to enjoy and protect; hence came the conservation movement in the latter half of the 19th century. Rivers were rafted and mountains were climbed solely for the sake of recreation, not to determine their geographical context.

In 1861, following an intense lobbying by artists of the Barbizon school, the French Waters and Forests Military Agency set an &quot;artistic reserve&quot; in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1,097 hectares, it is thought to be the first nature reserve in the world.

=== Modern conservation ===
Global conservation became an issue at the time of the dissolution of the British Empire in Africa in the late 1940s. The British established great wildlife preserves there. As before, this interest in conservation had an economic motive: in this case, big game hunting. Nevertheless, this led to growing recognition in the 1950s and the early 1960s of the need to protect large spaces for wildlife conservation worldwide. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), founded in 1961, grew to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world.

Early conservationists advocated the creation of a legal mechanism by which boundaries could be set on human activities in order to preserve natural and unique lands for the enjoyment and use of future generations. This profound shift in wilderness thought reached a pinnacle in the US with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which allowed for parts of U.S. National Forests to be designated as &quot;wilderness preserves&quot;. Similar acts, such as the 1975 Eastern Wilderness Areas Act, followed.

Nevertheless, initiatives for wilderness conservation continue to increase. There are a growing number of projects to protect tropical rainforests through conservation initiatives. There are also large-scale projects to conserve wilderness regions, such as Canada&#x27;s Boreal Forest Conservation Framework. The Framework calls for conservation of 50 percent of the 6,000,000 square kilometres of boreal forest in Canada&#x27;s north. In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, organizations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society, the WILD Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, The Wilderness Society (United States) and many others are active in such conservation efforts.

The 21st century has seen another slight shift in wilderness thought and theory. It is now understood that simply drawing lines around a piece of land and declaring it a wilderness does not necessarily make it a wilderness. All landscapes are intricately connected and what happens outside a wilderness certainly affects what happens inside it. For example, air pollution from Los Angeles and the California Central Valley affects Kern Canyon and Sequoia National Park. The national park has miles of &quot;wilderness&quot; but the air is filled with pollution from the valley. This gives rise to the paradox of what a wilderness really is; a key issue in 21st century wilderness thought.

==National parks==

The creation of national parks, beginning in the 19th century, preserved some especially attractive and notable areas, but the pursuits of commerce, lifestyle, and recreation combined with increases in human population have continued to result in human modification of relatively untouched areas. Such human activity often negatively impacts native flora and fauna. As such, to better protect critical habitats and preserve low-impact recreational opportunities, legal concepts of &quot;wilderness&quot; were established in many countries, beginning with the United States (see below).

The first National Park was Yellowstone, which was signed into law by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on 1 March 1872. The Act of Dedication declared Yellowstone a land &quot;hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.&quot;

When national parks were established in an area, the Native Americans that had been living there were forcibly removed so visitors to the park could see nature without humans present. National parks are seen as areas untouched by humans, when in reality, humans existed in these spaces, until settler colonists came in and forced them off their lands in order to create the national parks. The concept glorifies the idea that before settlers came, the US was an uninhabited landscape. This erases the reality of Native Americans, and their relationship with the land and the role they had in shaping the landscape. Such erasure suggests there were areas of the US which were historically unoccupied, once again erasing the existence of Native Americans and their relationship to the land. In the case of Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and Yosemite, the &#x27;preservation&#x27; of these lands by the US government was what caused the Native Americans who lived in the areas to be systematically removed.

Historian Mark David Spence has shown that the case of Glacier National Park and the Blackfeet people who live there is a perfect example of such erasure. The Blackfeet people had specifically designated rights to the area, but the 1910 Glacier National Park act made void those rights. The act of &#x27;preserving&#x27; the land was specifically linked to the exclusion of the Blackfeet people. The continued resistance of the Blackfeet people has provided documentation of the importance of the area to many different tribes.

The world&#x27;s second national park, the Royal National Park, located just 32 km to the south of Sydney, Australia, was established in 1879.

The U.S. concept of national parks soon caught on in Canada, which created Banff National Park in 1885, at the same time as the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway was being built. The creation of this and other parks showed a growing appreciation of wild nature, but also an economic reality. The railways wanted to entice people to travel west. Parks such as Banff and Yellowstone gained favor as the railroads advertised travel to &quot;the great wild spaces&quot; of North America. When outdoorsman Teddy Roosevelt became president of the United States, he began to enlarge the U.S. National Parks system, and established the National Forest system.

By the 1920s, travel across North America by train to experience the &quot;wilderness&quot; (often viewing it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of Canada&#x27;s National Parks with the building of great hotels such as the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise.

Despite their similar name, national parks in England and Wales are quite different from national parks in many other countries. Unlike most other countries, in England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. Each park is operated by its own national park authority.

The United States philosophy around wilderness preservation through National Parks has been attempted in other countries. However, people living in those countries have different ideas surrounding wilderness than people in the United States, thus, the US concept of wilderness can be damaging in other areas of the world. India is more densely populated and has been settled for a long time. There are complex relationships between agricultural communities and the wilderness. An example of this is the Project Tiger parks in India. By claiming areas as no longer used by humans, the land moves from the hands of poor people to rich people. Having designated tiger reserves is only possible by displacing poor people, who were not involved in the planning of the areas. This situation places the ideal of wilderness above the already existing relationships between people and the land they live on. By placing an imperialistic ideal of nature onto a different country, the desire to reestablish wilderness is being put above the lives of those who live by working the land.

==Conservation and preservation in 20th century United States==
By the late 19th century, it had become clear that in many countries wild areas had either disappeared or were in danger of disappearing. This realization gave rise to the conservation movement in the United States, partly through the efforts of writers and activists such as John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, and John Muir, and politicians such as U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt.
The idea of protecting nature for nature&#x27;s sake began to gain more recognition in the 1930s with American writers like Aldo Leopold, calling for a &quot;land ethic&quot; and urging wilderness protection. It had become increasingly clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to deep ecology; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.

Two different groups had emerged within the US environmental movement by the early 20th century: the conservationists and the preservationists. The initial consensus among conservationists was split into &quot;utilitarian conservationists&quot; later to be referred to as conservationists, and &quot;aesthetic conservationists&quot; or preservationists. The main representative for the former was Gifford Pinchot, first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the &quot;proper use of nature,&quot; whereas the preservationists sought the &quot;protection of nature from use.&quot; Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether. The management of US public lands during the years 1960s and 70s reflected these dual visions, with conservationists dominating the Forest Service, and preservationists the Park Service

==Formal wilderness designations==

=== International ===
The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, 1a (strict nature reserves) and 1b (Wilderness areas).

There have been recent calls for the World Heritage Convention to better protect wilderness and to include the word wilderness in their selection criteria for Natural Heritage Sites

Forty-eight countries have wilderness areas established via legislative designation as IUCN protected area management Category 1b sites that do not overlap with any other IUCN designation. They are: Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Finland, French Guiana, Greenland, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Northern Mariana Islands, Portugal, Seychelles, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tanzania, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. At publication, there are 2,992 marine and terrestrial wilderness areas registered with the IUCN as solely Category 1b sites.

Twenty-two other countries have wilderness areas. These wilderness areas are established via administrative designation or wilderness zones within protected areas. Whereas the above listing contains countries with wilderness exclusively designated as Category 1b sites, some of the below-listed countries contain protected areas with multiple management categories including Category 1b. They are: Argentina, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Honduras, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela, and Zambia.

The German National Strategy on Biological Diversity aims to establish wilderness areas on 2% of its terrestrial territory by 2020 (7,140 km2). However, protected wilderness areas in Germany currently only cover 0.6% of the total terrestrial area. In absence of pristine landscapes, Germany counts national parks (IUCN Category II) as wilderness areas. The government counts the whole area of the 16 national parks as wilderness. This means, also the managed parts are included in the &quot;existing&quot; 0,6%. There is no doubt, that Germany will miss its own time-dependent quantitative goals, but there are also some critics, that point a bad designation practice: Findings of disturbance ecology, according to which process-based nature conservation and the 2% target could be further qualified by more targeted area designation, pre-treatment and introduction of megaherbivores, are widely neglected. Since 2019 the government supports bargains of land that will then be designated as wilderness by 10 Mio. Euro annually. The German minimum size for wilderness candidate sites is normally 10 km2. In some cases (i.e. swamps) the minimum size is 5 km2.

=== Finland ===
There are twelve wilderness areas in the Sami native region in northern Finnish Lapland. They are intended both to preserve the wilderness character of the areas and further the traditional livelihood of the Sami people. This means e.g. that reindeer husbandry, hunting and taking wood for use in the household is permitted. As population is very sparse, this is generally no big threat to the nature. Large scale reindeer husbandry has influence on the ecosystem, but no change is introduced by the act on wilderness areas. The World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) classifies the areas as &quot;VI Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources&quot;.

=== France ===
Since 1861, the French Waters and Forests Military Agency (Administration des Eaux et Forêts) put a strong protection on what was called the « artistic reserve » in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1,097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve.

Then in the 1950s, Integral Biological Reserves (Réserves Biologiques Intégrales, RBI) are dedicated to man free ecosystem evolution, on the contrary of Managed Biological reserves (Réserves Biologiques Dirigées, RBD) where a specific management is applied to conserve vulnerable species or threatened habitats.

Integral Biological Reserves occurs in French State Forests or City Forests and are therefore managed by the National Forests Office. In such reserves, all harvests coupe are forbidden excepted exotic species elimination or track safety works to avoid fallen tree risk to visitors (already existing tracks in or on the edge of the reserve).

At the end of 2014, there were 60 Integral Biological Reserves in French State Forests for a total area of 111,082 hectares and 10 in City Forests for a total of 2,835 hectares.

===Greece===

In Greece there are some parks called &quot;ethniki drimoi&quot; (εθνικοί δρυμοί, national forests) that are under protection of the Greek government. Such parks include Olympus, Parnassos and Parnitha National Parks.

===New Zealand===

There are seven Wilderness Areas in New Zealand as defined by the National Parks Act 1980 and the Conservation Act 1987 that fall well within the IUCN definition. Wilderness areas cannot have any human intervention and can only have indigenous species re-introduced into the area if it is compatible with conservation management strategies.

In New Zealand wilderness areas are remote blocks of land that have high natural character. The Conservation Act 1987 prevents any access by vehicles and livestock, the construction of tracks and buildings, and all indigenous natural resources are protected. They are generally over 400 km2 in size.

Three Wilderness Areas are currently recognised, all on the West Coast: Adams Wilderness Area, Hooker/Landsborough Wilderness Area and Paparoa Wilderness Area.

===United States===

In the United States, a Wilderness Area is an area of federal land set aside by an act of Congress. It is typically at least 5,000 acres (about 8 mi2 or 20 km2) in size. Human activities in wilderness areas are restricted to scientific study and non-mechanized recreation; horses are permitted but mechanized vehicles and equipment, such as cars and bicycles, are not.

The United States was one of the first countries to officially designate land as &quot;wilderness&quot; through the Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness Act is an important part of wilderness designation because it created the legal definition of wilderness and established the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as &quot;an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammelled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.&quot;

Wilderness designation helps preserve the natural state of the land and protects flora and fauna by prohibiting development and providing for non-mechanized recreation only.

The first administratively protected wilderness area in the United States was the Gila National Forest. In 1922, Aldo Leopold, then a ranking member of the U.S. Forest Service, proposed a new management strategy for the Gila National Forest. His proposal was adopted in 1924, and 750,000 acres of the Gila National Forest became the Gila Wilderness.

The Great Swamp in New Jersey was the first formally designated wilderness refuge in the United States. It was declared a wildlife refuge on 3 November 1960. In 1966 it was declared a National Natural Landmark and, in 1968, it was given wilderness status. Properties in the swamp had been acquired by a small group of residents of the area, who donated the assembled properties to the federal government as a park for perpetual protection. Today the refuge amounts to that are within thirty miles of Manhattan.
While wilderness designations were originally granted by an Act of Congress for Federal land that retained a &quot;primeval character&quot;, meaning that it had not suffered from human habitation or development, the Eastern Wilderness Act of 1975 extended the protection of the NWPS to areas in the eastern states that were not initially considered for inclusion in the Wilderness Act. This act allowed lands that did not meet the constraints of size, roadlessness, or human impact to be designated as wilderness areas under the belief that they could be returned to a &quot;primeval&quot; state through preservation.

Approximately are designated as wilderness in the United States. This accounts for 4.82% of the country&#x27;s total land area; however, 54% of that amount is found in Alaska (recreation and development in Alaskan wilderness is often less restrictive), while only 2.58% of the lower continental United States is designated as wilderness. As of 2023 there are 806 designated wilderness areas in the United States ranging in size from Florida&#x27;s Pelican Island at to Alaska&#x27;s Wrangell-Saint Elias at .

===Western Australia===
In Western Australia, a wilderness area is an area that has a wilderness quality rating of 12 or greater and meets a minimum size threshold of 80 km2 in temperate areas or 200 km2 in arid and tropical areas. A wilderness area is gazetted under section 62(1)(a) of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 by the Minister on any land that is vested in the Conservation Commission of Western Australia.

==International movement==
At the forefront of the international wilderness movement has been The WILD Foundation, its founder Ian Player and its network of sister and partner organizations around the globe. The pioneer World Wilderness Congress in 1977 introduced the wilderness concept as an issue of international importance, and began the process of defining the term in biological and social contexts. Today, this work is continued by many international groups who still look to the World Wilderness Congress as the international venue for wilderness and to The WILD Foundation network for wilderness tools and action. The WILD Foundation also publishes the standard references for wilderness professionals and others involved in the issues: &quot;Wilderness Management: Stewardship and Protection of Resources and Values&quot;, the &quot;International Journal of Wilderness&quot;, &quot;A Handbook on International Wilderness Law and Policy&quot; and &quot;Protecting Wild Nature on Native Lands&quot; are the backbone of information and management tools for international wilderness issues.

The Wilderness Specialist Group within the World Commission on Protected Areas (WTF/WCPA) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) plays a critical role in defining legal and management guidelines for wilderness at the international level and is also a clearing-house for information on wilderness issues. The IUCN Protected Areas Classification System defines wilderness as &quot;A large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, and/or sea retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition (Category 1b).&quot; The WILD Foundation founded the WTF/WCPA in 2002 and remains co-chair.

==Extent==
The most recent efforts to map wilderness show that less than one quarter (~23%) of the world&#x27;s wilderness area now remains, and that there have been catastrophic declines in wilderness extent over the last two decades. Over 3 million square kilometers (10 percent) of wilderness was converted to human land-uses. The Amazon and Congo rain forests suffered the most loss. Human pressure is extending into almost every corner of the planet. The loss of wilderness could have serious implications for biodiversity conservation.

According to a previous study, &quot;Wilderness: Earth&#x27;s Last Wild Places,&quot; carried out by Conservation International, 46% of the world&#x27;s land mass is wilderness. For purposes of this report, &quot;wilderness&quot; was defined as an area that &quot;has 70% or more of its original vegetation intact, covers at least and must have fewer than five people per square kilometer.&quot; However, an IUCN/UNEP report published in 2003, found that only 10.9% of the world&#x27;s land mass is currently a Category 1 Protected Area, that is, either a &quot;strict nature reserve&quot; (5.5%) or &quot;protected wilderness&quot; (5.4%). Such areas remain relatively untouched by humans. Of course, there are large tracts of lands in national parks and other protected areas that would also qualify as wilderness. However, many protected areas have some degree of human modification or activity, so a definitive estimate of true wilderness is difficult.

The Wildlife Conservation Society generated a &quot;human footprint&quot; using a number of indicators, the absence of which indicate wildness: human population density, human access via roads and rivers, human infrastructure for agriculture and settlements and the presence of industrial power (lights visible from space). The society estimates that 26% of the Earth&#x27;s land mass falls into the category of &quot;Last of the wild.&quot; The wildest regions of the world include the Arctic Tundra, the Siberia Taiga, the Amazon rainforest, the Tibetan Plateau, the Australia Outback and deserts such as the Sahara, and the Gobi. However, from the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, leading to claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Unnatural Histories&quot; claimed that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.

The percentage of land area designated wilderness does not necessarily reflect a measure of its biodiversity. Of the last natural wilderness areas, the taiga—which is mostly wilderness—represents 11% of the total land mass in the Northern Hemisphere. Tropical rainforest represent a further 7% of the world&#x27;s land base. Estimates of the Earth&#x27;s remaining wilderness underscore the rate at which these lands are being developed, with dramatic declines in biodiversity as a consequence.
==Critique==
The American concept of wilderness has been criticized by some nature writers. For example, William Cronon writes that what he calls a wilderness ethic or cult may &quot;teach us to be dismissive or even contemptuous of such humble places and experiences&quot;, and that &quot;wilderness tends to privilege some parts of nature at the expense of others&quot;, using as an example &quot;the mighty canyon more inspiring than the humble marsh.&quot; This is most clearly visible with the fact that nearly all U.S. National Parks preserve spectacular canyons and mountains, and it was not until the 1940s that a swamp became a national park—the Everglades. In the mid-20th century national parks started to protect biodiversity, not simply attractive scenery.

Cronon also believes the passion to save wilderness &quot;poses a serious threat to responsible environmentalism&quot; and writes that it allows people to &quot;give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead... to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness&quot;.

Michael Pollan has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book &quot;Second Nature&quot;, Pollan writes that &quot;once a landscape is no longer &#x27;virgin&#x27; it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable.&quot; Another challenge to the conventional notion of wilderness comes from Robert Winkler in his book, &quot;Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness&quot;. &quot;On walks in the unpeopled parts of the suburbs,&quot; Winkler writes, &quot;I’ve witnessed the same wild creatures, struggles for survival, and natural beauty that we associate with true wilderness.&quot; Attempts have been made, as in the Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers Act, to distinguish &quot;wild&quot; from various levels of human influence: in the Act, &quot;wild rivers&quot; are &quot;not impounded&quot;, &quot;usually not accessible except by trail&quot;, and their watersheds and shorelines are &quot;essentially primitive&quot;.
Another source of criticism is that the criteria for wilderness designation is vague and open to interpretation. For example, the Wilderness Act states that wilderness must be roadless. The definition given for roadless is &quot;the absences of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use&quot;. However, there have been added sub-definitions that have, in essence, made this standard unclear and open to interpretation, and some are drawn to narrowly exclude existing roads.

Coming from a different direction, some criticism from the Deep Ecology movement argues against conflating &quot;wilderness&quot; with &quot;wilderness reservations&quot;, viewing the latter term as an oxymoron that, by allowing the law as a human construct to define nature, unavoidably voids the very freedom and independence of human control that defines wilderness. True wilderness requires the ability of life to undergo speciation with as little interference from humanity as possible. Anthropologist and scholar on wilderness Layla Abdel-Rahim argues that it is necessary to understand the principles that govern the economies of mutual aid and diversification in wilderness from a non-anthropocentric perspective.

Others have criticized the American concept of wilderness as rooted in white supremacy, ignoring Native American perspectives on the natural environment and excluding people of color from narratives about human interactions with the environment. Many early conservationists, such as Madison Grant, were also heavily involved in the eugenics movement. Grant, who worked alongside President Theodore Roosevelt to create the Bronx Zoo, also wrote &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot;, a book on eugenics that was later praised by Adolf Hitler. Grant is also known to have featured Ota Benga, a Mbuti man from Central Africa, in the Bronx Zoo monkey house exhibit. John Muir, another important figure in the early conservation movement, referred to African-Americans as &quot;making a great deal of noise and doing little work&quot;, and compared Native Americans to unclean animals who did not belong in the wilderness. Environmental history professor Miles A. Powell of Nanyang Technological University has argued that much of the early conservation movement was deeply tied to and inspired by a desire to preserve the Nordic race. Prakash Kashwan, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who specializes in environmental policies and environmental justice, argues that the racist ideas of many early conservationists created a narrative of wilderness that has led to &quot;fortress conservation&quot; policies that have driven Native Americans off of their land. Kashwan has proposed conservation practices that would allow Indigenous people to continue using the land as a more just and more effective alternative to fortress conservation. The idea that the natural world is primarily made up of remote wilderness areas has also been criticized as classist, with environmental sociologist Dorceta Taylor arguing that this leads to experiencing wilderness becoming a privilege, as working-class people are often unable to afford transportation to wilderness areas. She further argues that, due to poverty and lack of access to transportation caused by systemic racism, this perception is also rooted in racism.

=== Human–nature dichotomy ===
Another critique of wilderness is that it perpetuates the human-nature dichotomy. The idea that nature and humans are separate entities can be traced back to European colonial views. To European settlers, land was an inherited right and was to be used to profit. While native groups saw their relationship with the land in a more holistic view, they were eventually subjected to European property systems. Colonists from Europe saw the American landscape as wild, savage, dark, [etc.] and thus needed to be tamed in order for it to be safe and habitable. Once cleared and settled, these areas were depicted as &quot;Eden itself&quot;. Yet the native peoples of those lands saw &quot;wilderness&quot; as that when the connection between humans and nature is broken. For native communities, human intervention was a part of their ecological practices.

There is a historical belief that wilderness must not only be tamed to be protected but that humans also need to be outside of it. In order to clear certain areas for conservation, such as national parks, involved the removal of native communities from their land. Some authors have come to describe this type of conservation as conservation-far, where humans and nature are kept separate. The other end of the conservation spectrum then, would be conservation-near, which would mimic native ecological practices of humans integrated into the care of nature.

Most scientists and conservationists agree that no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by indigenous people, or through global processes such as climate change or pollution. Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration, also affect the interior of wildernesses.

<text>Beat Street is a 1984 American dance drama film featuring New York City hip hop culture of the early 1980s. Set in the South Bronx, the film follows the lives of a pair of brothers and their group of friends, all of whom are devoted to various elements of early hip hop culture, including breakdancing, DJing and graffiti.

==Plot==
In the South Bronx, New York City, budding disc jockey and MC Kenny &quot;Double K&quot; Kirkland is hired as a featured DJ at a house party at an abandoned building, accompanied by his best friend Ramon Franco, a graffiti artist known by his tag &quot;Ramo&quot;, and his friend/manager Chollie Wilson. Kenny&#x27;s younger brother Lee crashes the party with his dance crew the Beat Street Breakers, who begin sparring with rival crew the Bronx Rockers. The next day, Chollie informs Kenny of complimentary tickets to the Roxy, one of Manhattan&#x27;s most popular nightclubs. Meanwhile, Ramon&#x27;s father, Domingo, implores his son to get a job and marry Carmen Carraro, the young mother of his illegitimate baby.

While visiting The Roxy a few nights later, Kenny meets composer Tracy Carlson. During an ensuing breakdance battle between the Breakers and Bronx Rockers, Tracy notices Lee&#x27;s performance, inviting him to audition for a dancing television show. Lee, Kenny and their crew visit a dance rehearsal at the City College of New York (CCNY), where she is contributing a dance composition to a television program, and Lee performs only to be rejected. Kenny accuses Tracy of being condescending towards Lee.

Later, Ramon visits with Carmen and their baby. After her mother accuses him of shirking his responsibility, Carmen begs him to take them away. Meanwhile, Tracy visits the Kirklands&#x27; apartment to apologize. She and Kenny bond over some of his musical mixes that he plays for her. Later, the pair visits the subway tunnels, where Ramon and Lee are spray-painting a wall. Ramon longingly watches a clean, white train pass, claiming it his dream canvas. Startled by rival graffiti artist Spit, a shadowy and taciturn hooded street punk who has been defacing Ramon&#x27;s artwork and is tagging a freshly painted wall, the group departs.

Walking Tracy home, Kenny explains the death of his older brother Franklin, a gang member. The next day, Chollie invites him to play at the Burning Spear club, run by DJ Kool Herc. Accompanied by Tracy, Kenny impresses the crowd with his skills, and Kool Herc hires him to perform at the establishment the following weekend. The next day, Ramon asks Domingo if Carmen can live with them. Domingo declines, insisting that he marry Carmen and provide for his child.

Later, Chollie takes Kenny to the Roxy, where a talent scout is auditioning local performers, and invites the scout to see Kenny deejay at the Burning Spear. Afterward, Kenny visits CCNY to surprise Tracy and sees her intimately embracing her professor, Robert. Ramon tells his friends he plans to move Carmen and the baby into a vacant apartment upstairs, and eventually obtains employment at a hardware store. His friends help him furnish the apartment, surprising Carmen with a small housewarming party.

On Saturday night at the Burning Spear, Kenny impresses the talent scout, who invites him to perform at the Roxy on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Meanwhile, Tracy permits Kenny to use the college&#x27;s computerized studio, while she assists Robert at a nearby piano. Kenny accidentally deletes his work, and rejects Robert and Tracy&#x27;s attempts to help him, telling her their relationship might not last.

Waiting for a train with Ramon, Kenny worries that he potentially offended Tracy, while Ramon laments that his job limits his opportunities to perfect and showcase his artistry. Suddenly, he notices an all-white train on the &quot;A&quot; line, deciding to paint it that night after work. Later that evening, Kenny helps Ramon paint the train, but Spit, lurking nearby, tags the train even before Ramon can complete the other side. In the ensuing scuffle in the subway tunnels, Spit sprays paint in Ramon&#x27;s eyes and both tussle on the roadbed before rolling onto the electrified third rail, which fatally electrocutes both instantly.

After Ramon&#x27;s funeral, Kenny contemplates forgoing the Roxy&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve show, but Tracy and Chollie dissuade him. Kenny ultimately uses his big break to celebrate Ramon&#x27;s life, starting with a rap performance while images of Ramon and his work appear on a screen behind him, impressing Domingo. Grandmaster Melle Mel &amp; the Furious Five assist him along with a Bronx gospel choir, backed by the City College Dancers and a group of twenty-five breakdancers.

Kadeem Hardison was credited as &quot;High School Student&quot; in the director&#x27;s cut of the film. However, his scenes were all cut from the final theatrical version.

==Background==
The movie was inspired by an original story, &quot;The Perfect Beat&quot;, by journalist Steven Hager, who sold the idea to producer Harry Belafonte. Only a few character names from Hager&#x27;s story made it into the final film. The 1983 film &quot;Wild Style&quot; was an obvious inspiration and model, in terms of story, style, characters, and themes. In addition, some of the plotline of the film was based on the New York City graffiti documentary, &quot;Style Wars&quot;, also released in 1983. Most visibly, the antagonist, Spit, in &quot;Beat Street&quot; was lifted from the real-life graffiti artist CAP MPC, who was portrayed in &quot;Style Wars&quot;.

&quot;Beat Street&quot; was filmed in New York City in December 1983, in the boroughs of The Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Several scenes were shot inside the city&#x27;s subway system, both onboard trains and in stations, notably Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets, 57th Street-Sixth Avenue and Fresh Pond Road. Scenes were also filmed on the campus of the City College of New York, which includes the concert venue Aaron Davis Hall. Many of the internal dance sequences were filmed at the popular night club, the &quot;Roxy&quot;, located in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.

==Musical performances and soundtrack==

There are several performances in the movie, notably from established early hip hop groups, Grandmaster Melle Mel &amp; the Furious Five, Doug E. Fresh, Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soulsonic Force and the Treacherous Three. As a member of the Treacherous Three, Kool Moe Dee also appeared in the film.

The musical performance of Kool Moe Dee stands as one of the few media appearances he has ever made without his trademark sunglasses (a style he had not yet adopted at the time). In addition to these acts, Guy Davis, who played Kenny, is also a blues musician in real life.

Three female MCs appear in a party scene in &quot;Beat Street&quot;: Debbie D, Sha-Rock and Lisa Lee. They perform a limited and limiting performance as a group called &quot;Us Girls&quot; (see video). The first lyrics you hear are sung (vs. rapped). This moment tends to diminish the significance of women in early hip hop performance as if by 1984 female emcees were already exceptional to a musical genre that was still emerging and developing. The group sings in unison, &quot;Us Girls / Can Boogie, too,&quot; then each emcee performs a short rhyme.

The film also includes other musical performances from Tina B and The System, both of whom appear on the soundtrack album. Though not featured on the album, there were also appearances by rapper Richard Lee Sisco and singers Bernard Fowler and Brenda K. Starr, known as the Queen of freestyle who later became a Latin artist.

At least three breakdancing battles between the New York City Breakers and the Rock Steady Crew were also included in the film. In addition, the Roxy audition scene features a pair of breakdancing boys known as the Fantastic Duo.

This was the first American film to feature more than one soundtrack album. Originally, Atlantic Records, which released the soundtrack albums, had three volumes planned, but only two of these were released. The second volume was never released on compact disc.

The trailer includes an alternate version of the title song performed by Kool Moe Dee, a version that was not featured in the movie or on the original soundtrack albums.

==Reception==
&quot;Beat Street&quot; was screened out of competition at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. It received mixed critical reviews and the film holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews.

==Legacy==

&quot;Beat Street&quot;&#x27;s impact was felt internationally as well as throughout the United States. In Germany, for example, movies such as &quot;Beat Street&quot; and &quot;Wild Style&quot; are credited with introducing the hip hop movement to the country. Because movies are so easily distributed over borders, part of the importance of this movie lay in its ability to influence both East Germany and West Germany, which at the time were still divided. &quot;Beat Street&quot; was of particular importance in socialist East Germany, since its release was intended to illustrate the evils of capitalism (poverty, racial segregation) for young audiences. However, because the film focused so heavily on the visual aspects of hip-hop culture, such as breaking and graffiti, these aspects were far more influential and inspired an emerging German hip-hop scene.

It was precisely these visual aspects that helped bring hip-hop culture to Germany, rather than simply a genre of music. &quot;Beat Street&quot; appeared in the German Democratic Republic at almost the same time as in the West. Dresden, the center of the Beat Street scene was geographically out of western media range, making it a perfect center to explore this genre of music. The hip hop scene for the entire public would meet at breakdancing competitions, emceeing competitions, and graffiti spraying. Puerto Rican and African American breakdancing, hip hop and Latin freestyle dance sounds, and inner-city American graffiti made up what Germans knew as hip hop culture. The aftermath of &quot;Beat Street&quot; propelled events such as competitions in emceeing, break dancing, and graffiti spraying throughout Germany.

==In popular culture ==

* AZ mentions the film in his song &quot;The Come Up&quot;, in the line &quot;Before Beat Street, streets was heavily in deep with the ryders.&quot;
* The Notorious B.I.G. in his song &quot;Suicidal Thoughts&quot; said, &quot;Should I die on the train tracks like Ramo in Beat Street/People at my funeral frontin&#x27; like they miss me.&quot;
* Jay Electronica mentions the film in his song &quot;Exhibit A (Transformations)&quot; in the line &quot;Who gone bring the game back/who gone spit that Ramo on the train tracks&quot;.
* Ras Kass in his song &quot;Won&#x27;t Catch Me Runnin&#x27;&quot; said, &quot;When my voice hits the mic, I electrocute Spit like Beat Street.&quot;
* Mr. Lif, on &quot;Elektro&quot;, rapped the lines: &quot;So I use the same flow to put niggas under in The Serpent and the Rainbow/Go back to Beat Street and resurrect Ramo knock the shit out of Spit verbal eclipse&quot;
* In &quot;The Proud Family Movie&quot;, Oscar offhandedly mentions Beat Street.
* In 2022, author Steven Hager published the inside story of what went wrong with the film.

<doc id="396286" wikidata="Q900905" url="?curid=396286" title="Ginzburg–Landau theory">
<text>In physics, Ginzburg–Landau theory, often called Landau–Ginzburg theory, named after Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau, is a mathematical physical theory used to describe superconductivity. In its initial form, it was postulated as a phenomenological model which could describe type-I superconductors without examining their microscopic properties. One GL-type superconductor is the famous YBCO, and generally all cuprates.

Later, a version of Ginzburg–Landau theory was derived from the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer microscopic theory by Lev Gor&#x27;kov, thus showing that it also appears in some limit of microscopic theory and giving microscopic interpretation of all its parameters. The theory can also be given a general geometric setting, placing it in the context of Riemannian geometry, where in many cases exact solutions can be given. This general setting then extends to quantum field theory and string theory, again owing to its solvability, and its close relation to other, similar systems.

==Introduction==
Based on Landau&#x27;s previously established theory of second-order phase transitions, Ginzburg and Landau argued that the free energy density formula_1 of a superconductor near the superconducting transition can be expressed in terms of a complex order parameter field formula_2, where the quantity formula_3 is a measure of the local density of superconducting electrons formula_4 analogous to a quantum mechanical wave function. While formula_5 is nonzero below a phase transition into a superconducting state, no direct interpretation of this parameter was given in the original paper. Assuming smallness of formula_6 and smallness of its gradients, the free energy density has the form of a field theory and exhibits U(1) gauge symmetry:

formula_7

where
* formula_8 is the free energy density of the normal phase, 
* formula_9 and formula_10 are phenomenological parameters that are functions of T (and often written just formula_11 and formula_12). 
* formula_13 is an effective mass, 
* formula_14 is an effective charge (usually formula_15, where e is the charge of an electron), 
* formula_16 is the magnetic vector potential, and 
* formula_17 is the magnetic field. 

The total free energy is given by formula_18. By minimizing formula_19 with respect to variations in the order parameter formula_20 and the vector potential formula_16, one arrives at the Ginzburg–Landau equations

formula_22

formula_23

where formula_24 denotes the dissipation-free electric current density and &quot;Re&quot; the &quot;real part&quot;. The first equation — which bears some similarities to the time-independent Schrödinger equation, but is principally different due to a nonlinear term — determines the order parameter, formula_20. The second equation then provides the superconducting current.

==Simple interpretation==
Consider a homogeneous superconductor where there is no superconducting current and the equation for &quot;ψ&quot; simplifies to:
formula_26

This equation has a trivial solution: . This corresponds to the normal conducting state, that is for temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature, .

Below the superconducting transition temperature, the above equation is expected to have a non-trivial solution (that is formula_27). Under this assumption the equation above can be rearranged into:
formula_28

When the right hand side of this equation is positive, there is a nonzero solution for (remember that the magnitude of a complex number can be positive or zero). This can be achieved by assuming the following temperature dependence of 
formula_29
with formula_30:

*Above the superconducting transition temperature, &quot;T&quot; &gt; &quot;T&quot;&quot;c&quot;, the expression (&quot;T&quot;) / is positive and the right hand side of the equation above is negative. The magnitude of a complex number must be a non-negative number, so only solves the Ginzburg–Landau equation.
*Below the superconducting transition temperature, &quot;T&quot; &lt; &quot;T&quot;&quot;c&quot;, the right hand side of the equation above is positive and there is a non-trivial solution for . Furthermore, formula_31 that is approaches zero as &quot;T&quot; gets closer to &quot;T&quot;&quot;c&quot; from below. Such a behavior is typical for a second order phase transition.

In Ginzburg–Landau theory the electrons that contribute to superconductivity were proposed to form a superfluid. In this interpretation, ||2 indicates the fraction of electrons that have condensed into a superfluid.

==Coherence length and penetration depth==
The Ginzburg–Landau equations predicted two new characteristic lengths in a superconductor. The first characteristic length was termed coherence length, &quot;ξ&quot;. For &quot;T&quot; &gt; &quot;Tc&quot; (normal phase), it is given by

:formula_32

while for &quot;T&quot; &lt; &quot;Tc&quot; (superconducting phase), where it is more relevant, it is given by

:formula_33

It sets the exponential law according to which small perturbations of density of superconducting electrons recover their equilibrium value &quot;ψ&quot;0. Thus this theory characterized all superconductors by two length scales. The second one is the penetration depth, &quot;λ&quot;. It was previously introduced by the London brothers in their London theory. Expressed in terms of the parameters of Ginzburg–Landau model it is

:formula_34

where &quot;ψ&quot;0 is the equilibrium value of the order parameter in the absence of an electromagnetic field. The penetration depth sets the exponential law according to which an external magnetic field decays inside the superconductor.

The original idea on the parameter &quot;κ&quot; belongs to Landau. The ratio &quot;κ&quot; = &quot;λ&quot;/&quot;ξ&quot; is presently known as the Ginzburg–Landau parameter. It has been proposed by Landau that Type I superconductors are those with 0 &lt; &quot;κ&quot; &lt; 1/, and Type II superconductors those with &quot;κ&quot; &gt; 1/.

==Fluctuations==

The phase transition from the normal state is of second order for Type II superconductors, taking into account fluctuations, as demonstrated by Dasgupta and Halperin, while for Type I superconductors it is of first order, as demonstrated by Halperin, Lubensky and Ma.

==Classification of superconductors==

In the original paper Ginzburg and Landau observed the existence of two types of superconductors depending 
on the energy of the interface between the normal and superconducting states. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value &quot;Hc&quot;. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value &quot;H&quot;&quot;c&quot;1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength &quot;H&quot;&quot;c&quot;2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are Type I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type II.

The most important finding from Ginzburg–Landau theory was made by Alexei Abrikosov in 1957. He used Ginzburg–Landau theory to explain experiments on superconducting alloys and thin films. He found that in a type-II superconductor in a high magnetic field, the field penetrates in a triangular lattice of quantized tubes of flux vortices.

==Geometric formulation==
The Ginzburg–Landau functional can be formulated in the general setting of a complex vector bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold. This is the same functional as given above, transposed to the notation commonly used in Riemannian geometry. In multiple interesting cases, it can be shown to exhibit the same phenomena as the above, including Abrikosov vortices (see discussion below).

For a complex vector bundle formula_35 over a Riemannian manifold formula_36 with fiber formula_37, the order parameter formula_20 is understood as a section of the vector bundle formula_35. The Ginzburg–Landau functional is then a Lagrangian for that section:

:formula_40

The notation used here is as follows. The fibers formula_37 are assumed to be equipped with a Hermitian inner product formula_42 so that the square of the norm is written as formula_43. The phenomenological parameters formula_11 and formula_12 have been absorbed so that the potential energy term is a quartic mexican hat potential; i.e., exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking, with a minimum at some real value formula_46. The integral is explicitly over the volume form 
:formula_47

for an formula_48-dimensional manifold formula_36 with determinant formula_50 of the metric tensor formula_51.

The formula_52 is the connection one-form and formula_19 is the corresponding curvature 2-form (this is not the same as the free energy formula_19 given up top; here, formula_19 corresponds to the electromagnetic field strength tensor). The formula_56 corresponds to the vector potential, but is in general non-Abelian when formula_57, and is normalized differently. In physics, one conventionally writes the connection as formula_58 for the electric charge formula_59 and vector potential formula_56; in Riemannian geometry, it is more convenient to drop the formula_59 (and all other physical units) and take formula_62 to be a one-form taking values in the Lie algebra corresponding to the symmetry group of the fiber. Here, the symmetry group is SU(n), as that leaves the inner product formula_42 invariant; so here, formula_56 is a form taking values in the algebra formula_65.

The curvature formula_19 generalizes the electromagnetic field strength to the non-Abelian setting, as the curvature form of an affine connection on a vector bundle . It is conventionally written as
:formula_67

That is, each formula_68 is an formula_69 skew-symmetric matrix. (See the article on the metric connection for additional articulation of this specific notation.) To emphasize this, note that the first term of the Ginzburg–Landau functional, involving the field-strength only, is
:formula_70
which is just the Yang–Mills action on a compact Riemannian manifold.

The Euler–Lagrange equations for the Ginzburg–Landau functional are the Yang–Mills equations 
:formula_71
and
:formula_72
where formula_73 is the adjoint of formula_74, analogous to the codifferential formula_75. Note that these are closely related to the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations.

===Specific results===
In string theory, it is conventional to study the Ginzburg–Landau functional for the manifold formula_36 being a Riemann surface, and taking formula_77; i.e., a line bundle. The phenomenon of Abrikosov vortices persists in these general cases, including formula_78, where one can specify any finite set of points where formula_20 vanishes, including multiplicity. The proof generalizes to arbitrary Riemann surfaces and to Kähler manifolds. In the limit of weak coupling, it can be shown that formula_80 converges uniformly to 1, while formula_81 and formula_82 converge uniformly to zero, and the curvature becomes a sum over delta-function distributions at the vortices. The sum over vortices, with multiplicity, just equals the degree of the line bundle; as a result, one may write a line bundle on a Riemann surface as a flat bundle, with &quot;N&quot; singular points and a covariantly constant section.

When the manifold is four-dimensional, possessing a spin&quot;c&quot; structure, then one may write a very similar functional, the Seiberg–Witten functional, which may be analyzed in a similar fashion, and which possesses many similar properties, including self-duality. When such systems are integrable, they are studied as Hitchin systems.

==Self-duality==
When the manifold formula_36 is a Riemann surface formula_84, the functional can be re-written so as to explicitly show self-duality. One achieves this by writing the exterior derivative as a sum of Dolbeault operators formula_85. Likewise, the space formula_86 of one-forms over a Riemann surface decomposes into a space that is holomorphic, and one that is anti-holomorphic: formula_87, so that forms in formula_88 are holomorphic in formula_89 and have no dependence on formula_90; and &quot;vice-versa&quot; for formula_91. This allows the vector potential to be written as formula_92 and likewise formula_93 with formula_94 and formula_95.

For the case of formula_96, where the fiber is formula_97 so that the bundle is a line bundle, the field strength can similarly be written as
:formula_98 
Note that in the sign-convention being used here, both formula_99 and formula_19 are purely imaginary (&quot;viz&quot; U(1) is generated by formula_101 so derivatives are purely imaginary). The functional then becomes
:formula_102
The integral is understood to be over the volume form 
:formula_103,
so that
:formula_104
is the total area of the surface formula_105. The formula_106 is the Hodge star, as before. The degree formula_107 of the line bundle formula_108 over the surface formula_105 is 
:formula_110
where formula_111 is the first Chern class.

The Lagrangian is minimized (stationary) when formula_112 solve the Ginzberg–Landau equations
:formula_113
Note that these are both first-order differential equations, manifestly self-dual. Integrating the second of these, one quickly finds that a non-trivial solution must obey 
:formula_114.
Roughly speaking, this can be interpreted as an upper limit to the density of the Abrikosov vortecies. One can also show that the solutions are bounded; one must have formula_115.

==In string theory==
In particle physics, any quantum field theory with a unique classical vacuum state and a potential energy with a degenerate critical point is called a Landau–Ginzburg theory. The generalization to &quot;N&quot; = (2,2) supersymmetric theories in 2 spacetime dimensions was proposed by Cumrun Vafa and Nicholas Warner in November 1988; in this generalization one imposes that the superpotential possess a degenerate critical point. The same month, together with Brian Greene they argued that these theories are related by a renormalization group flow to sigma models on Calabi–Yau manifolds. In his 1993 paper &quot;Phases of &quot;N&quot; = 2 theories in two-dimensions&quot;, Edward Witten argued that Landau–Ginzburg theories and sigma models on Calabi–Yau manifolds are different phases of the same theory. A construction of such a duality was given by relating the Gromov–Witten theory of Calabi–Yau orbifolds to FJRW theory an analogous Landau–Ginzburg &quot;FJRW&quot; theory. Witten&#x27;s sigma models were later used to describe the low energy dynamics of 4-dimensional gauge theories with monopoles as well as brane constructions.

<text>The Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) is a non-political, non-sectarian international fraternal order of Odd Fellowship. It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Wildey in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Evolving from the Order of Odd Fellows founded in England during the 18th century, the IOOF was originally chartered by the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity in England but has operated as an independent organization since 1842, although it maintains an inter-fraternal relationship with the English Order. The order is also known as the &quot;Triple Link Fraternity&quot;, referring to the order&#x27;s &quot;Triple Links&quot; symbol, alluding to its motto &quot;Friendship, Love and Truth&quot;.

While several unofficial Odd Fellows Lodges had existed in New York City circa 1806–1818, because of its charter relationship, the American Odd Fellows is regarded as being founded with &quot;Washington Lodge No 1&quot; in Baltimore at the Seven Stars Tavern on April 26, 1819, by Thomas Wildey along with some associates who assembled in response to an advertisement in the New Republic. The following year, the lodge affiliated with the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity and was granted the authority to institute new lodges. Previously, Wildey had joined the Grand United Order of Oddfellows (1798-) in 1804 but followed through with the split of Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity (1810–) before immigrating to the United States in 1817.

In 1842, after a dispute on authority, the American Lodges formed a governing system separate from the English Order, and in 1843 assumed the name Independent Order of Odd Fellows.

Like other fraternities, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows began by limiting their membership to white men only. On September 20, 1851, the IOOF became the first fraternity in the United States to include white women when it adopted the &quot;Beautiful Rebekah Degree&quot; by initiative of Schuyler Colfax, later Vice-President of the United States. Daughters of Rebekah are an auxiliary organization to the Odd Fellows.

Beyond fraternal and recreational activities, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows promotes the ethic of reciprocity and charity, by implied inspiration of Judeo-Christian ethics. The largest Sovereign Grand Lodge of all fraternal orders of Odd Fellows since the 19th century, it enrolls some 600,000 members divided in approximately 10,000 lodges into 26 countries, inter-fraternally recognized by the second largest, the British-seated Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity.

==History==

=== Precursor ===

Odd Fellows lodges were first documented in 1730 in England from which many organizations emerged.

While several unofficial Odd Fellows lodges had existed in New York City sometime in the period 1806 to 1818, the American Odd Fellows is regarded as being founded with &quot;Washington Lodge No 1&quot; in Baltimore at the Seven Stars Tavern on April 26, 1819, by Thomas Wildey along with some associates who assembled in response to a newspaper advertisement. The following year, the lodge affiliated with the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity was granted the authority to institute new lodges. Wildey had joined the Grand United Order of Oddfellows in 1804, then joined its splinter order, Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity, before immigrating to the United States in 1817.

=== Foundation ===
In 1842, after an elementary dispute on whether the American lodges were to be involved in decision-making procedures, in a split along racial lines, some American Lodges formed with exclusively whites-only membership and a separate governing system from the English Order. In 1843, they changed the name of their organization to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.

=== 19th century ===
In the following years, lodges were instituted all over the country, first in the east and later in the west. After rejection from the Independent Order of Odd Fellows due to race, an African American sailor, Peter Ogden, petitioned the Grand United Order of Oddfellows for a charter which was granted. Grand United Order of Odd Fellows in America are still headquartered in Philadelphia.

On September 20, 1851, IOOF became the first national fraternity to accept both men and women when it formed the Daughters of Rebekah as an auxiliary organization. Schuyler Colfax (Vice President of the United States (1869–1873) under President Ulysses S. Grant) was the force behind the movement. Both the Odd Fellows and Rebekahs have appendant branches known as Encampments and Patriarchs Militant.

The American Civil War (1861–1865) shattered the IOOF in America; membership decreased and many lodges were unable to continue their work, especially in the southern states. After the Civil War, with the beginning of industrialization, the deteriorating social circumstances brought large numbers of people to the IOOF and the lodges rallied.

Over the next half-century, also known as the &quot;Golden age of fraternalism&quot; in America, the Odd Fellows became the largest among all fraternal organizations (at the time, even larger than Freemasonry). By 1889, the IOOF had lodges in every American state. Compared to Masonic lodges, membership in the Odd Fellows lodges tended to be more common among the lower middle class and skilled workers and less common among the wealthy white collar workers and professionals.

In 1896, the World Almanac showed the Odd Fellows as the largest among all fraternal organizations.

By the late nineteenth century, the Order had spread to most of the rest of the world, establishing lodges in the Americas, Australasia, and Europe. According to the Journal of the Annual Communication of the Sovereign Grand Lodge 1922, page 426, there were a reported 2,676,582 members. While this data from 1921 may not be the exact zenith of its membership, the organization experienced a loss in membership of 23.5% between 1920 and 1930, explained in large part by the development of the commercial insurance industry, and has continually declined.

===20th century===

The Great Depression and the introduction of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal brought a decline in membership. During the depression, people could not afford Odd Fellows membership fees, and when the New Deal&#x27;s social reforms started to take effect, the need for the social work of the Odd Fellows declined.

In 1971 the IOOF changed its constitution, removing its whites only clause. In 1979 the Order had 243,000 members.

Some branches of the order (&quot;i.e.&quot;, some countries) have allowed women to join the Odd Fellows itself, leading to the Rebekahs&#x27; decline in importance. Also, the appendant branches and their degrees are, in some countries, becoming regarded as less important or too time-consuming, and are gradually being abandoned.

===21st century===
Although there was a decline in membership in fraternal organizations in general during the 20th century, membership in the 21st century started to increase.

The Odd Fellows scholarship has extended financial assistance to the youth for their education from time to time.

== Organization ==
===Current status===
The IOOF continues in the 21st century with lodges around the world, and is claimed to be the &quot;largest united international fraternal order in the world under one head&quot;, with every lodge working with the Sovereign Grand Lodge located in the United States. Also, the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity and the IOOF have recognized each other inter-fraternally; members of the Manchester Unity and the IOOF can visit each other&#x27;s lodges, and are welcome as brothers and sisters. Currently, there are about 12,000 lodges with nearly 600,000 members.

Units of the order in the United States include:
* Odd Fellows Lodge
* Rebekahs Lodge
* Encampment
* Ladies Encampment Auxiliary (LEA)
* Patriarchs Militant
* Ladies Auxiliary Patriarchs Militant (LAPM)
* Junior Odd Fellows Lodge
* Theta Rho Girls Club
* United Youth Groups
* Zeta Lambda Tau

===Objectives===

As an organization, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows aims to provide a framework that promotes personal and social development. Lodge degrees and activities aim to improve and elevate every person to a higher, nobler plane; to extend sympathy and aid to those in need, making their burdens lighter, relieving the darkness of despair; to war against vice in every form, and to be a great moral power and influence for the good of humanity. Teachings in the Order are conducted through the exemplification of the Degrees of membership. The Degrees are conferred on the candidate by their Lodge, and are teachings of principles and truths by ceremonies and symbols. The Degrees are presented largely by means of allegory and drama. For Odd Fellows, the degrees in Odd Fellowship emphasize a leaving of the old life and the start of a better one, of welcoming travelers, and of helping those in need. Lodges also provide an international social network of members in 26 countries. The command of the IOOF is to &quot;visit the sick, relieve the distressed, bury the dead and educate the orphan&quot;. Specifically, IOOF has stated the following purposes:

:* To improve and elevate the character of mankind by promoting the principles of friendship, love, truth, faith, hope, charity and universal justice.

;Finland
After the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Grand Lodge of Sweden was established in 1895, the interest in Odd Fellowship was awakened in Finland. After Finland had declared independence in 1917, the idea of an Odd Fellows Lodge in Finland was raised again. A few interested people from the town Vaasa in Ostrobothnia province were able to join the Swedish Odd Fellow lodges until the Sovereign Grand Lodge finally permitted the Grand Lodge of Sweden to officially establish the IOOF in Finland in 1925. The first lodge established was named Wasa Lodge no.1 in the coastal town of Vaasa. Additional lodges were then formed in Helsinki in 1927 and a third lodge in Turku in 1931. Odd Fellows in Finland encountered great difficulties in the 1930s and during the wartime. Especially the question of premises was quite difficult for many years. However, all three lodges which had been established before the war continued their activities almost without interruption. Only after the war, in the year 1951 was the next lodge established. Since then, the development has been steady and quite rapid. In the beginning of the 1980s, the number of brother lodges was 35 and the number of sister lodges 19 leading to the institution of the Grand Lodge of Finland on June 2, 1984. In the year 2008, there were 57 Odd Fellows lodges and 48 Rebekah lodges in Finland with about 8,200 members.

Elkan&quot; and &quot;G.E. van Erpen&quot;, former members of an Odd Fellows lodge in the United States. This initiative commenced in 1876, but initially the Dutch Government was not pleased. It subsequently stopped its resistance later in the same year. The translation of the rituals was the next problem, combined with the recognition by the &quot;Soeverine Loge&quot; (Sovereign Grand Lodge). Eventually the founder of the German Order, &quot;Ostheim&quot;, was appointed &quot;Gedeputeerd Groot Sire voor Nederland&quot; and installed the first Dutch board. In 1899, lodges were established in The Hague and Groningen. Also in 1899, the first &quot;Nederlandse Grootorde&quot; (Grand Lodge of Netherlands) was founded. On September 2, 1911, the first Belgian Lodge, &quot;Belgia Loge nr. 201&quot;, was established in Antwerp, and the Order changed its name to &quot;Orde in Nederland en België&quot;.

===Regional grand lodges===

There are IOOF lodges in at least 29 countries: Each Grand Lodge has a number of subordinate lodges that report to them.

== Degrees and initiation ==

In the IOOF system, different degrees are conferred depending on whether one is initiated into the Daughters of Rebekah or the Oddfellows proper.

For Oddfellows, four lodge degrees; three higher, encampment degrees; and one Patriarchs Militant degree are conferred.

For Rebekahs, one lodge degree, one encampment degree, and one Ladies Auxiliary Patriarchs Militant (LAPM) degree are conferred.

The Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans (AMOS), an IOOF appendant body, confers two degrees. The Ladies of the Orient (LOTO), an appendant body of the Daughters of Rebekahs, similarly confers two degrees.

=== Oddfellow degrees ===

== Symbols and regalia ==
To fully understand the purposes and principles of Odd Fellowship, instruction in ceremonial form is divided into degrees. These degrees are dramatic in form and aim to emulate and impart the principles of the fraternity: Friendship, Love, Truth, Faith, Hope, Charity and Universal Justice. Each degree consists of symbols that aim to teach a practical moral code and encourages members to live and act upon them to act positive change upon the world. In the past, when most Odd Fellows lodges offered financial benefits for the sick and distressed members, such symbols, passwords and hand signs were used as proof of membership and to protect the lodge funds from impostors. These symbols, signs and passwords have been carried forward to modern times as a tradition. The most widely encountered symbol of the IOOF – on signs, buildings and gravemarkers – is the three-link chain (&quot;the Chain With Three Links&quot;, the &quot;Triple Links&quot;) with initials &#x27;F&#x27;, &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; signifying Friendship, Love and Truth.

===Female auxiliaries===
The Rebekah Lodges were founded on September 20, 1851, when, after considerable debate, the Sovereign Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows voted to adopt the Rebekah Degree, largely due to the efforts of Schuyler Colfax. The first Rebekah Degrees were honorary awards only, conferred on wives and daughters of Odd Fellows at special lodge meetings, and recipients were known as &quot;Daughters of Rebekah,&quot; taken from the Biblical character of Rebekah.
*International Association of Rebekah Assemblies

===Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans===
The Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans (AMOS) is an unofficial, oriental-styled auxiliary body of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, formed in 1924 by amalgamation of several previous bodies dating back to the end of the 19th century. Only male Odd Fellows in good standing with their subordinate lodges are eligible to join. In 1950, the Sovereign Grand Lodge recognized AMOS as &quot;The Playground of Odd Fellowship.&quot; AMOS is only presently active in the United States and Canada, though it once also existed in Cuba and the Panama Canal Zone.

=== Junior lodge ===
The Junior Lodge was established in 1921 initially under the name the &quot;Loyal Sons of the Junior Order of Odd fellows&quot;, for boys interested in odd fellowship. The ritual and ceremonies were supervised by a member of the senior order. There were 4,873 members in 1970. Membership is open to boys of age 8–21, its motto being &quot;Honor and Fidelity&quot;, and its symbolic colours silver and dark blue.

===Baltimore monument===

<doc id="396292" wikidata="Q58219" url="?curid=396292" title="Aero Spacelines Super Guppy">
<text>The Aero Spacelines Super Guppy is a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft that is used for hauling outsize cargo components. It was the successor to the Pregnant Guppy, the first of the Guppy aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. Five were built in two variants, both of which were colloquially referred to as the &quot;Super Guppy&quot;.

The Super Guppy is the only airplane to carry a complete S-IVB stage, the third stage of the Saturn V rocket. It did so several times during the Apollo program.

==Design and development==


The first Super Guppy, or &quot;SG&quot;, was built directly from a retired USAF Boeing YC-97J Stratofreighter. The fuselage was lengthened to , and ballooned out to a maximum inside diameter of , the length of the cargo compartment being . The floor of the cargo compartment was still only wide, as necessitated by the use of the Stratocruiser fuselage.

In addition to the fuselage modifications, the Super Guppy used Pratt &amp; Whitney T-34-P-7WA turboprop engines for increased power and range, and modified wing and tail surfaces. It could carry a load of and cruise at .

After a month of tests, Super Guppy suffered fuselage collapse on September 25, 1965, when undergoing high speed dives during certification tests. After starting a dive at 10,000 feet the upper fuselage collapsed. The plane had been carrying 30,000 pounds of borate in 100-pound sacks, which were damaged and spilled powder that temporarily blinded the crew. With the help of a DC-9 chase plane, the crew was able to land on the dry bed of Rogers Dry Lake and save the aircraft. After that, Guppy&#x27;s upper superstructure was redesigned and rebuilt at Edwards Air Force Base.
The second version was officially known as the Super Guppy Turbine (SGT), although the first Super Guppy also used turboprop engines. However, this variant used Allison 501-D22C engines. Unlike the previous Guppy, the main portion of its fuselage was constructed from scratch. By building from scratch, Aero Spacelines was able to widen the floor of the cargo compartment to . The overall cargo-compartment length was increased to , and the improved fuselage and engines allowed for a maximum load of . These design improvements, combined with a pressurized crew cabin that allowed for higher-altitude cruising, allowed the SGT to transport more cargo than its predecessors.

The SGT retained only the cockpit, wings, tail, and main landing gear of the 377. The nose gear was taken from a Boeing 707 and rotated 180 degrees. This dropped the front of the aircraft slightly, levelling the cargo-bay floor and simplifying loading operations.

In the early 1970s, two SGT aircraft were used by Airbus to transport airplane parts from production facilities to the final assembly plant in Toulouse. In 1982 and 1983, two additional Super Guppy Turbines were built by Union de Transports Aériens Industries in France after Airbus bought the right to produce the aircraft. The four Super Guppies were later replaced in this role by the Airbus Beluga, capable of carrying twice as much cargo by weight.

==Variants==
*Aero Spacelines B-377-SG Super Guppy, prototype of a much enlarged version of the Guppy using C-97J components, powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney T-34-P-7WA turbo-prop engines.
*Aero Spacelines B-377-SGT Super Guppy Turbine (Guppy 201), production version powered by Allison 501-D22C turbo-prop engines, using an enlarged cargo section built from scratch instead of being converted from original C-97J components.

==Aircraft==

One Super Guppy remains in service with NASA. Three are on display, and one was scrapped.

*Super Guppy N940NS (previously N1038V), serial number 52-2693, is on display at the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum near Tucson, Arizona.
*Super Guppy Turbine F-BTGV (formerly N211AS), serial number 0001, was on static display at the former British Aviation Heritage Centre at the Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome. The aircraft was broken up in December 2020 with the cockpit preserved by the South Wales Aviation Museum.
*Super Guppy Turbine F-BPPA (formerly N212AS), serial number 0002, is on static display at Aeroscopia near the Airbus factory at Toulouse–Blagnac Airport in France.
*Super Guppy Turbine F-GDSG, serial number 0003, is on static display near the Airbus factory at Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport in Germany.
*Super Guppy Turbine N941NA (formerly F-GEAI), serial number 0004, is still in service with NASA as a transport aircraft and is based at the El Paso International Airport.

Thomas Conway was born in County Kerry, Ireland to James Conway and his wife Julieanne Conway. Though born to a Catholic family, it is unclear how closely he adhered to the faith. As a child, he immigrated to France with his parents. At the age of 14, he joined the French Royal Army&#x27;s Irish Brigade and rose to the rank of colonel by 1772.

==Arrival in America==

Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War he went to the Thirteen Colonies and volunteered to join to the Continental Congress for military service in 1777. Based on an introduction from Silas Deane, Congress appointed him as a brigadier general in the Continental Army on May 13, and sent him on to George Washington.

Conway commanded the leading brigade on the American right flank at the Battle of Germantown, and was praised for his actions. However, Washington opposed his promotion to major general, believing that many American-born officers with longer and valuable service deserved the rank; this caused a falling out between Washington and Conway. Congress appointed Conway a major general despite Washington&#x27;s objections in December 1777, and made him Inspector General of the American army.

==Conway Cabal==

When his name was used politically, it was used to describe the infighting known as the Conway Cabal. During the affair, he had written a letter to Horatio Gates in which he referred to Washington as a &quot;weak general,&quot; criticizing General Washington&#x27;s failed tactics against British General William Howe. The letter stated: &quot;Heaven has been determined to save your country; or a weak general [George Washington] and bad counselors would have ruined it.&quot; The letter was intercepted by Washington and his backers after its delivery was botched by Brigadier-General James Wilkinson, and brought before the Congress for inquiry. When the contents of the letter were made public, Conway lost his command as a result. He tried a ploy that had worked before his promotion, and submitted his resignation to Congress in March 1778. This time it was accepted, so he was forced to leave the Continental Army. John Cadwalader shot him in a duel on July 4, 1778. When he recovered, he wrote an apology to Washington and returned to France.

There is also a slightly different version of these happenings:

==Later life==

Conway later returned to the French army, where in 1787 he was promoted to &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; and appointed as the governor of French India. In 1793 he fought with royalist forces in opposition to French Revolution in southern France. During the French Revolution he was condemned to death. He was saved only by an appeal to the British (against which he had fought in the American Revolutionary War), but was compelled to flee from France for his life.

Having been aided by the British government, in 1794 Conway was named colonel of one of the six regiments of the British Army&#x27;s Catholic Irish Brigade, formed by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Although people in positions of authority remained impressed with his military accomplishments, he continued to suffer from ill health. He visited Bath, Somerset on several occasions in the hopes of improving his health; the Bath Chronicle recorded his arrival for the final time on February 12, 1795. He died soon after and was interred in Bath Abbey on March 3; the exact location of his memorial is unknown due to major renovations conducted in the 1860s.

Conway was survived by his wife, Francois Antoinette Langlois du Bouchet who was created the Contesse de Conway, whom he married on June 1, 1775 and had a daughter the following year, on July 12, 1776, named Caroline. The Countess lived until 1828 and as a widow of a British Army colonel she continued to receive a government pension.

<text>Halkirk () is a village on the River Thurso in Caithness, in the Highland council area of Scotland. From Halkirk the B874 road runs towards Thurso in the north and towards Georgemas in the east. The village is within the parish of Halkirk, and is said by locals to be Scotland&#x27;s first planned village.

In 1222 Jon Haraldsson, the last native Scandinavian to be Jarl of Orkney, was indirectly implicated in the burning of Adam of Melrose at his hall at Halkirk by local farmers when this part of Caithness was still part of the Kingdom of Norway. A contemporary chronicler, Boethius the Dane blamed Haraldsson for the bishop&#x27;s death. After the jarl swore oaths to his own innocence, Alexander II took the opportunity to assert his claims to the mainland part of the Orkney jarldom. He visited Caithness in person, and hanged the majority of the farmers, while mutilating the rest. His actions were applauded by Pope Honorius III, and a quarter of a century later, he was continuing to receive commendation from the Catholic Church, as in the reward of a bull from Pope Celestine IV.

==Cathedral==
It was at one time the site of the cathedral of the Diocese of Caithness. In the early 13th century, a revolt against the tithe, imposed by the Bishop, led the local husbandmen to lay siege to the cathedral kitchen, and burn it down, with Adam of Melrose, the Bishop, still inside. Adam&#x27;s successor Gilbert de Moravia moved the seat of the Diocese to Dornoch, and there are no remains of the Halkirk cathedral church or the bishop&#x27;s seat.

==Historic distilleries==
Halkirk has had two whisky distilleries, Gerston from 1796 to 1885, and Ben Morven (also known as Gerston II) from 1886 to circa 1911. Both were established on the banks of the River Thurso, near Gerston Farm, and both drew water from Calder Burn. The Ben Morven distillery was named for the mountain, the highest point in Caithness.

The original Gerston distillery was first registered by a Francis Swanson, and was expanded by two sons, John and James, in 1825. Sir Robert Peel is said to have acquired a taste for the whisky. The distillery closed not long after it was sold to new owners in 1872, and a London company, calling themselves the Gerston Distillery Company, decided to build a new distillery.

In 1897 the new distillery was sold to Northern Distilleries Limited, who gave it the Ben Morven name. It was never very successful, and it closed circa 1911. The stillhouse is still standing.

==Fairview House==
Fairview House is a former poorhouse dating from 1856, which is now a residential complex.

==Notable residents==
Halkirk is the birthplace of Alexander Keith (1795–1873), who settled in Halifax, Nova Scotia and became established as a respected politician and brewer. He is known across Canada for his most famous beer, Alexander Keith&#x27;s India Pale Ale.

Prof John Malcolm FRSE (1873–1954) was also born and raised in Halkirk.

<doc id="396306" wikidata="Q158530" url="?curid=396306" title="Castletown, Isle of Man">
<text>Castletown (, pronounced ) is a town in the Isle of Man, geographically within the historical parish of Malew but administered separately. Lying at the south of the island, it was the Manx capital until 1869. The centre of town is dominated by Castle Rushen, a well-preserved medieval castle, originally built for a Viking king.

==History==

Castletown is the former capital of the Isle of Man and site of the Tynwald, and can trace its roots back to 1090. The town has narrow streets and small fishing cottages. Castle Rushen (at the centre of the town) was originally built in 1265 for a Norse king, then fortified and added to by successive rulers between the 13th and 16th centuries. The castle has been used as a fortress, a residence for the Kings and Lords of Mann, the site of a mint and even a prison (past prisoners include a bishop and two newspaper editors). The town and castle were the site of a number of sieges and battles, especially during the years when control of the island passed between the Norse, Scots and English. Robert the Bruce laid siege to and captured the castle three times.

The history of the town and island is illustrated in four Manx National Heritage sites in the centre of Castletown: Castle Rushen, the Nautical Museum (in the secret passage-filled home of inventor, politician, banker and probable smuggler George Quayle), the Old Grammar School (originally a church from 1200 AD) and the Old House of Keys.
Fishing boats still go out to fish from the harbour. Commercial traffic to the port ended in the 1970s, although there has been an ongoing expansion of financial and industrial businesses in the area. The first telephones on the Isle of Man appeared in Castletown in 1901.

==Politics==
Castletown is, along with Peel, Ramsey, and formerly Douglas (now designated a city) one of four town local authorities. They were all designated as towns by the Town Act 1852. Castletown became a local authority in 1883.

Until 2016 Castletown was also a House of Keys constituency, electing one Member of the House of Keys (MHK). The town&#x27;s representative for 30 years until 2011 was Tony Brown, who was the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man after the 2006 Manx general election. He retired in 2011 and was replaced as MHK for Castletown by Richard Ronan. Since 2016 Castletown has been part of the Arbory, Castletown &amp; Malew constituency.

In 1874, the House of Keys moved from Castletown to Douglas.

==Demographics==
The Isle of Man Census 2011 lists the town&#x27;s population as 3,097 (2006: 3,109) It is the fourth largest town on the island, after Douglas, Ramsey and Peel, but is also smaller than Onchan and Port Erin, which have the status of villages.

==Geography and geology==

The town lies on the northwest side of Castletown Bay. The opposite shore of the bay is the west coast of the distinctively-shaped Langness Peninsula. To the north-east are Ronaldsway Airport and industrial zone, and the village of Ballasalla; to the north-west the villages of Ballabeg and Colby; and to the west Port St Mary and Port Erin.

The older parts of the town are largely built of local grey limestone. At , a short distance to the south of the town, there are the remains of an ancient volcano and various other features such as fossils and thick sheets of limestone.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The A3 road connects Castletown with Ramsey via St John&#x27;s, while the A5 road (also known as New Castletown Road as opposed to the Old Castletown Road which takes a more rural route nearer the coast) connects the town with Douglas to the north-east and Port Erin to the west.

The A25 road was the historical route to Douglas and is now bypassed by the A5. There are free electric car charging stations available in a car park in the centre of the town. The town has several car parks including one above the harbour close to the old school house, to the rear of the Castle Arms and off Victoria Road as well as dedicated parking for the local bank, supermarkets and the railway station.

===Buses===
Bus services operate through the town to Douglas, Port St Mary and Port Erin using route numbers 1, 2, 11 and 12; these run about every twenty minutes on weekdays and Saturdays with a less frequent service at weekends and after 6.00 pm. Some of these services (1c and 11b) do not run through the town but use the bypass road. These routes are the island&#x27;s busiest, in part because they also serve Ronaldsway Airport just outside the town. A late evening service also operates on Friday and Saturday evenings, called the &quot;Hullad Oie&quot; (Night Owl), which charges premium fare rates. There are also occasional buses to Peel (Service No. 8) via Foxdale; all these buses are within the island&#x27;s transport network &quot;Bus Vannin&quot;, a government-run service which replaced the railway-operated Isle of Man Road Services in 1976.

===Railway===
The town is also served by Castletown railway station, on the sole remaining section of the Isle of Man Railway, a narrow gauge steam-operated railway which now runs 15 miles from Douglas to Port Erin. The railway station is on the northeasterly edge of the town next to Poulsom Park and playing fields, and was at one time used to transport beer from the Castletown Brewery as well as cattle and other livestock; remnants of the cattle dock are still visible at the railway station, which is open seasonally between March and November as well as at weekends around Christmas; there is a small volunteer group, the Friends of Castletown Railway Station, who tend to the area in association with the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters&#x27; Association, a local charity.

===Air===
The island&#x27;s only commercial airport, Ronaldsway Airport, is 2 km (just over one mile) northeast of the town and is served by both Bus Vannin and Castletown railway station as well as local taxi services. There is a closer railway station at Ronaldsway. The airport runways and aprons spread over the area to the edge of the grounds of King William&#x27;s College and close to the Janet&#x27;s Corner local authority housing estate. The airport was first used as an airfield in 1928, with passenger services to the United Kingdom commencing in 1933.

===Long-distance footpaths===
* The southern end of the Millennium Way long-distance footpath is at Castletown.
* The Raad ny Foillan long distance coastal footpath, opened in 1986, runs along the coast in the town.

==Education==
===Private college===
King William&#x27;s College is a private school. Founded in 1668 with funds from the Bishop Barrow Trust, it opened in 1833 with 46 boys. It is now co-educational, with about 500 pupils. The college has two sites in the town: the main estate is near the shore of Castletown Bay at the end of the main airport runway, and the Buchan School, the college&#x27;s junior school, is in the Westhill area of Castletown, about from the main campus.

===State schools===
Other schools are: Castle Rushen High School, a co-educational secondary state school in the south-west of the town; and one primary school, Victoria Road School, originally opened as a boys&#x27; school in 1895, with a girls&#x27; school in Hope Street. The old grammar school in the town, which later became a chapel, is now an exhibit of a Victorian period schoolroom, part of the &quot;Story of Mann&quot;. This is open to the public between Easter and November and can be found close to the castle and the Old House of Keys.

==Churches==

===Church of England===
On the town square is Old St Mary&#x27;s Church, the original parish and garrison church, which is now office accommodation. It once had a spire, but this was lost in the early 1900s.

The new St Mary&#x27;s Church is located on the harbour. It was consecrated in 1985 when the congregation moved from the Garrison (Old St Mary&#x27;s) Church in Castletown Square. The new church can be found in Hope Street, to the side of Thirtle Bridge. Known as St Mary&#x27;s on the Harbour, it is the parish church of Castletown.

Malew Church is located about one mile north of the town on the A3 road towards St John&#x27;s, a road which forms part of the Billown Circuit. The church&#x27;s name is derived from its original dedication to the early Celtic saint, Saint Moluag, who is said to have converted the Picts to Christianity in the west of Scotland. Malew Church has its own graveyard, unlike the churches in the town; the minor bend around the church grounds has the title &quot;Church Bends&quot; on the racing circuit.

St Thomas&#x27; chapel is the school chapel at King William&#x27;s College, and was built in 1878, and consecrated on 28 January 1879. Designed by local architect James Cowle, it features a scissor-braced roof, canopied stalls, wall paintings, and stained glass windows. Windows commemorate T. E. Brown, an old boy of the college. The chapel is staffed by a Church of England priest who is employed by the college and licensed by the Bishop of Sodor and Man.

===Catholic===
St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is on Bowling Green Road, near Janet&#x27;s Corner. It was built in the 1820s; it was the first post-Reformation Catholic Church to be built on the island. It is the third church in the town to be dedicated to St Mary the Virgin (&quot;Our Lady of Rushen&quot;). It has two intricate and colourful Celtic Revival/Art Nouveau windows, which depict the Annunciation and the Resurrection. These were made by the Clarke Brothers of Dublin.

===Methodist===
Castletown Methodist Church on Arbory Street, founded in 1932, is part of the Methodist Church in the Isle of Man, which in turn is part of the British Methodist Connexion. It can trace its history back to the visits of the founder of Methodism John Wesley to the town in the 18th century. It is sometimes known locally as Arbory Street, formerly to distinguish it from the Malew Street chapel when the former was the Wesleyan Methodist and the latter the Primitive Methodist Chapel.

==Sport==

===Football===
Castletown Metropolitan F.C. play in the Isle of Man Football League and are based at the Castletown Football Stadium, Malew Road. Formed in 1904, the club is one of the most successful on the Isle of Man. They have been champions of the Isle of Man League eight times, including three consecutive seasons from 1922–23 to 1924-25 and won the &quot;Manx F.A. Cup&quot; seven times.

===Rugby===
There are two Rugby Union football clubs in the town; both play in the Manx Shield:

Castletown R.U.F.C. are based at Poulsom Park. The club now has permanent changing facilities. These were officially opened in October 2006 and built with the support of the Rugby Football Union (RFU), Manx Lottery Trust, Manx Sports Council, Castletown Commissioners and the members of the team. With the newly formed Castletown Rugby Union Football Club Limited, the club has secured the tenure on the pitch at Poulsom Park, having taken on a lease from the Castletown Commissioners.

Southern Nomads R.U.F.C. are based at King William&#x27;s College.

===Cricket===
Castletown cricket club is based at King William&#x27;s College and is a member of the Isle of Man Cricket Association.

===Golf===
Castletown Golf &amp; Country Club is located on the Langness Peninsula. It is a tournament golf course, and is a Top 100 course designed by Old Tom Morris and redesigned by Mackenzie Ross. The 17th hole has the unusual feature of a drive over the Irish Sea. The links has hosted, among other events, the PGA Cup (1979), Europro Tour 2002, Manx Classic Pro Am and the Duke of York Young Champions Trophy in 2003 and again in 2005.

===Racing===
The Billown Circuit motor cycling course has its start line in the town. The course is home to the &quot;Southern 100&quot;, a motorcycle racing event held on the Isle of Man in July of each year. The event was first held in 1955, when there were three races for different classes of motorcycles; the current calendar includes twelve races for various classes. The paddock, clubhouse and race control are all located on the outskirts of the town.

Hockey

Castletown Hockey Club are the only hockey club in the south of the Isle of Man. They field 3 men&#x27;s, 4 women&#x27;s and 6 mixed teams plus 10 junior sides. They train at Castle Rushen High School, which is also their home pitch. Their website is https://castletownhockey.wordpress.com/.

It raises money for local charities. Each year there are over 100 competitors and teams from the Isle of Man and elsewhere. In 2011 the event celebrated its 40th anniversary.

===2011 Commonwealth Youth Games===
The &quot;culture day&quot; prior to the closing ceremony of the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games was held in Castletown on 12 September 2011 with competitors all travelling by steam train to the town square, where a number of attractions were laid on.

==Places of interest==
Much of the attraction of Castletown is in the quality of its many 18th- and early 19th-century buildings, many constructed in the local silver-grey limestone. The town centre retains its early layout, echoing the cluster of houses around the Castle, the harbour and the military parade ground, is still used as a market place. The interested visitor can still identify the original building plots, and the crofts attached to them, which have given their name to a residential area close to the town centre.

* Castle Rushen is a medieval castle which towers over the Market Square to the south-east and the harbour to the north-east. , a former of the Royal Navy, was named after the castle. It is the focal point of the town and is open to the public between Easter and October.
* The Old House of Keys was the location of Tynwald, the Manx parliament, from 1821 until it moved in 1874 to Douglas. The house was renovated in 2000 and is run as a museum by Manx National Heritage. Tynwald used to meet in Castletown except on Tynwald Day, when it traditionally met (and still meets) on Tynwald Hill in St John&#x27;s.
* The Old Grammar School is next to the harbour to the rear of the town square at the side of a large car park. It was originally built as a chapel about 1190–1230. The building ceased to be a school in the 1930s and is now a museum exhibit opened seasonally in connection with the other &quot;Story of Mann&quot; sites in the town.
* The Nautical Museum (also known as the &quot;Peggy Story&quot; in recent times) in Bridge Street opened in 1951; the main focus of the museum is an 18th-century yacht, the &quot;Peggy&quot; (Peggy of Castletown), housed in the boat cellar, where she has been since the 19th century. She had been bricked up and forgotten before being rediscovered by workmen. In early 2015, &quot;Peggy&quot; was moved to Douglas for conservation in a climate-controlled facility. The Nautical Museum is based in the house of local inventor (and politician, trader and possible smuggler) George Quayle, who had the house built with secret passages, doorways, and a replica of a captain&#x27;s cabin. Quayle had a bank next door at Bridge House, known as George Quayle &amp; Co. and also known as the Isle of Man Bank Company and Quayle&#x27;s Bank. Opening the safe involved posting a series of cannonballs, which ran through a mechanism invented by Quayle.
* Castletown Police Station (by the Castle entrance) was designed by the noted Arts &amp; Crafts architect Baillie Scott.
* The Museum of Witchcraft was in existence in the town for a short period at the &quot;Witches Mill&quot; which has since been redeveloped as flats. It was operated by the self-proclaimed witch Gerald Gardner who ran it under the title &quot;Folklore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft&quot;, becoming a familiar figure in the town.
* The railway station was constructed in 1902 from locally sourced limestone from Scarlett Point and has been extensively refurbished in recent times, notably being overhauled in 1994 to original form. It is open seasonally and many people&#x27;s first encounter with the town is their arrival at the railway station, which is a short walk from the centre.
* The Smelt Monument is an unusual monument in the Parade in the town centre.
* Hango Hill, the execution site of Illiam Dhone, is on the outskirts of the town on the road to Derbyhaven.
* Scarlett Point Visitor Centre is at the south-western tip of Castletown Bay.
* An unusual feature of the town is a permanent trail of over 70 &quot;fairy doors&quot; for tourists to find.

==Tunnels and legends==
Castle Rushen and the town have long been said to have networks of tunnels. In 1938 tunnels under the town square were found (by Ramsey Quayle, the local baker, who was replacing an oven in his basement) leading to the Castle from nearby houses. Bagnio House also had a tunnel leading from it. The legend of Ivar and Matilda tells how in 1249 the knight Ivar saved his betrothed Matilda from the attentions of King Reginald (Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson) and killed the king, after discovering a tunnel to the Castle, where Matilda was being kept prisoner. The killing continued an ongoing struggle between different factions of the royal family. There are also legends of giants in the tunnels under the Castle.

<text>Baasha (, &quot;Baʿšāʾ&quot;) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the third king of the northern Israelite Kingdom of Israel. He was the son of Ahijah of the Tribe of Issachar. Baasha&#x27;s story is told in .

== Reign ==
Baasha became king of Israel in the third year of Asa, king of Judah. () William F. Albright has dated his reign to 900–877 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 909–886 BCE. Baasha came to power by murdering the previous king, Nadab, at Gibbethon, followed by the entire House of Jeroboam (Nadab&#x27;s father and predecessor). Baasha had previously been a captain in Nadab&#x27;s own army. Like many military leaders, he appears to have risen from obscurity. The Jewish Encyclopedia suggests that because he came from the tribe of Issachar, &quot;he may have represented a local faction&quot;.

Over the course of his 24-year reign, Baasha was at war with Asa, king of Judah. He allied Israel with Aram and endeavored to strangle Judah&#x27;s trade by fortifying Ramah, a city five miles north of Jerusalem. King Asa of Judah then bribed King Ben-hadad of Syria to switch sides and attack Israel, prompting the loss of extensive territory in Dan and Naphtali northwest of the Sea of Galilee. Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah. Asa of Judah utilized the materials of the abandoned fort for the fortification of his own frontier towns, Geba and Mizpah.

Though Baasha remained in power for life, he was not without his opponents. The prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, foretold the destruction of his dynasty, which came to pass with the assassination of Baasha&#x27;s son Elah.

<text>Matrix mechanics is a formulation of quantum mechanics created by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan in 1925. It was the first conceptually autonomous and logically consistent formulation of quantum mechanics. Its account of quantum jumps supplanted the Bohr model&#x27;s electron orbits. It did so by interpreting the physical properties of particles as matrices that evolve in time. It is equivalent to the Schrödinger wave formulation of quantum mechanics, as manifest in Dirac&#x27;s bra–ket notation.

In some contrast to the wave formulation, it produces spectra of (mostly energy) operators by purely algebraic, ladder operator methods. Relying on these methods, Wolfgang Pauli derived the hydrogen atom spectrum in 1926, before the development of wave mechanics.

== Development of matrix mechanics ==
In 1925, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics.

=== Epiphany at Helgoland ===

In 1925 Werner Heisenberg was working in Göttingen on the problem of calculating the spectral lines of hydrogen. By May 1925 he began trying to describe atomic systems by observables only. On June 7, after weeks of failing to alleviate his hay fever with aspirin and cocaine, Heisenberg left for the pollen-free North Sea island of Helgoland. While there, in between climbing and memorizing poems from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;West-östlicher Diwan&quot;, he continued to ponder the spectral issue and eventually realised that adopting &quot;non-commuting&quot; observables might solve the problem. He later wrote:
It was about three o&#x27; clock at night when the final result of the calculation lay before me. At first I was deeply shaken. I was so excited that I could not think of sleep. So I left the house and awaited the sunrise on the top of a rock.

=== The three fundamental papers ===
After Heisenberg returned to Göttingen, he showed Wolfgang Pauli his calculations, commenting at one point:
Everything is still vague and unclear to me, but it seems as if the electrons will no more move on orbits.

On July 9 Heisenberg gave the same paper of his calculations to Max Born, saying that &quot;he had written a crazy paper and did not dare to send it in for publication, and that Born should read it and advise him&quot; prior to publication. Heisenberg then departed for a while, leaving Born to analyse the paper.

In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory without sharp electron orbits. Hendrik Kramers had earlier calculated the relative intensities of spectral lines in the Sommerfeld model by interpreting the Fourier coefficients of the orbits as intensities. But his answer, like all other calculations in the old quantum theory, was only correct for large orbits.

Heisenberg, after a collaboration with Kramers, began to understand that the transition probabilities were not quite classical quantities, because the only frequencies that appear in the Fourier series should be the ones that are observed in quantum jumps, not the fictional ones that come from Fourier-analyzing sharp classical orbits. He replaced the classical Fourier series with a matrix of coefficients, a fuzzed-out quantum analog of the Fourier series. Classically, the Fourier coefficients give the intensity of the emitted radiation, so in quantum mechanics the magnitude of the matrix elements of the position operator were the intensity of radiation in the bright-line spectrum. The quantities in Heisenberg&#x27;s formulation were the classical position and momentum, but now they were no longer sharply defined. Each quantity was represented by a collection of Fourier coefficients with two indices, corresponding to the initial and final states.

When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University. Born, with the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, began immediately to make the transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg&#x27;s paper.

A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors. (A brief review of Born&#x27;s role in the development of the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics along with a discussion of the key formula involving the non-commutativity of the probability amplitudes can be found in an article by Jeremy Bernstein. A detailed historical and technical account can be found in Mehra and Rechenberg&#x27;s book &quot;The Historical Development of Quantum Theory. Volume 3. The Formulation of Matrix Mechanics and Its Modifications 1925–1926.&quot;)

Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.

Born, however, had learned matrix algebra from Rosanes, as already noted, but Born had also learned Hilbert&#x27;s theory of integral equations and quadratic forms for an infinite number of variables as was apparent from a citation by Born of Hilbert&#x27;s work &quot;Grundzüge einer allgemeinen Theorie der Linearen Integralgleichungen&quot; published in 1912.

Jordan, too, was well equipped for the task. For a number of years, he had been an assistant to Richard Courant at Göttingen in the preparation of Courant and David Hilbert&#x27;s book &quot;Methoden der mathematischen Physik I&quot;, which was published in 1924. This book, fortuitously, contained a great many of the mathematical tools necessary for the continued development of quantum mechanics.

In 1926, John von Neumann became assistant to David Hilbert, and he would coin the term Hilbert space to describe the algebra and analysis which were used in the development of quantum mechanics.

A linchpin contribution to this formulation was achieved in Dirac&#x27;s reinterpretation/synthesis paper of 1925, which invented the language and framework usually employed today, in full display of the noncommutative structure of the entire construction.

=== Heisenberg&#x27;s reasoning ===
Before matrix mechanics, the old quantum theory described the motion of a particle by a classical orbit, with well defined position and momentum , , with the restriction that the time integral over one period of the momentum times the velocity must be a positive integer multiple of the Planck constant
formula_1
While this restriction correctly selects orbits with more or less the
right energy values , the old quantum mechanical formalism did not describe time dependent processes, such as the emission or absorption of radiation.

When a classical particle is weakly coupled to a radiation field, so that the radiative damping can be neglected, it will emit radiation in a pattern that repeats itself every orbital period. The frequencies that make up the outgoing wave are then integer multiples of the orbital frequency, and this is a reflection of the fact that is periodic, so that its Fourier representation has frequencies only.
formula_2
The coefficients are complex numbers. The ones with negative frequencies must be the complex conjugates of the ones with positive frequencies, so that will always be real,
formula_3

A quantum mechanical particle, on the other hand, cannot emit radiation continuously; it can only emit photons. Assuming that the quantum particle started in orbit number , emitted a photon, then ended up in orbit number , the energy of the photon is , which means that its frequency is .

For large and , but with relatively small, these are the classical frequencies by Bohr&#x27;s correspondence principle
formula_4
In the formula above, is the classical period of either orbit or orbit , since the difference between them is higher order in . But for small and , or if is large, the frequencies are not integer multiples of any single frequency.

Since the frequencies that the particle emits are the same as the frequencies in the Fourier description of its motion, this suggests that &quot;something&quot; in the time-dependent description of the particle is oscillating with frequency . Heisenberg called this quantity ,
and demanded that it should reduce to the classical Fourier coefficients in the classical limit. For large values of and but with relatively small,
 is the th Fourier coefficient of the classical motion at orbit . Since &quot;Xnm&quot; has opposite frequency to , the condition that is real becomes
formula_5

By definition, only has the frequency , so its time evolution is simple:
formula_6
This is the original form of Heisenberg&#x27;s equation of motion.

Given two arrays and describing two physical quantities, Heisenberg could form a new array of the same type by combining the terms , which also oscillate with the right frequency. Since the Fourier coefficients of the product of two quantities is the convolution of the Fourier coefficients of each one separately, the correspondence with Fourier series allowed Heisenberg to deduce the rule by which the arrays should be multiplied,
formula_7

Born pointed out that &quot;this is the law of matrix multiplication&quot;, so that the position, the momentum, the energy, all the observable quantities in the theory, are interpreted as matrices. Under this multiplication rule, the product depends on the order: is different from .

The matrix is a complete description of the motion of a quantum mechanical particle. Because the frequencies in the quantum motion are not multiples of a common frequency, the matrix elements &quot;cannot be interpreted as the Fourier coefficients of a sharp classical trajectory&quot;. Nevertheless, as matrices, and satisfy the classical equations of motion; also see Ehrenfest&#x27;s theorem, below.

=== Matrix basics ===

When it was introduced by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Pascual Jordan in 1925, matrix mechanics was not immediately accepted and was a source of controversy, at first. Schrödinger&#x27;s later introduction of wave mechanics was greatly favored.

Part of the reason was that Heisenberg&#x27;s formulation was in an odd mathematical language, for the time, while Schrödinger&#x27;s formulation was based on familiar wave equations. But there was also a deeper sociological reason. Quantum mechanics had been developing by two paths, one led by Einstein, who emphasized the wave–particle duality he proposed for photons, and the other led by Bohr, that emphasized the discrete energy states and quantum jumps that Bohr discovered. De Broglie had reproduced the discrete energy states within Einstein&#x27;s framework – the quantum condition is the standing wave condition, and this gave hope to those in the Einstein school that all the discrete aspects of quantum mechanics would be subsumed into a continuous wave mechanics.

Matrix mechanics, on the other hand, came from the Bohr school, which was concerned with discrete energy states and quantum jumps. Bohr&#x27;s followers did not appreciate physical models that pictured electrons as waves, or as anything at all. They preferred to focus on the quantities that were directly connected to experiments.

In atomic physics, spectroscopy gave observational data on atomic transitions arising from the interactions of atoms with light quanta. The Bohr school required that only those quantities that were in principle measurable by spectroscopy should appear in the theory. These quantities include the energy levels and their intensities but they do not include the exact location of a particle in its Bohr orbit. It is very hard to imagine an experiment that could determine whether an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is to the right or to the left of the nucleus. It was a deep conviction that such questions did not have an answer.

The matrix formulation was built on the premise that all physical observables are represented by matrices, whose elements are indexed by two different energy levels. The set of eigenvalues of the matrix were eventually understood to be the set of all possible values that the observable can have. Since Heisenberg&#x27;s matrices are Hermitian, the eigenvalues are real.

If an observable is measured and the result is a certain eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector is the state of the system immediately after the measurement. The act of measurement in matrix mechanics collapses the state of the system. If one measures two observables simultaneously, the state of the system collapses to a common eigenvector of the two observables. Since most matrices don&#x27;t have any eigenvectors in common, most observables can never be measured precisely at the same time. This is the uncertainty principle.

If two matrices share their eigenvectors, they can be simultaneously diagonalized. In the basis where they are both diagonal, it is clear that their product does not depend on their order because multiplication of diagonal matrices is just multiplication of numbers. The uncertainty principle, by contrast, is an expression of the fact that often two matrices and do not always commute, i.e., that does not necessarily equal 0. The fundamental commutation relation of matrix mechanics,
formula_8
implies then that &quot;there are no states that simultaneously have a definite position and momentum&quot;.

This principle of uncertainty holds for many other pairs of observables as well. For example, the energy does not commute with the position either, so it is impossible to precisely determine the position and energy of an electron in an atom.

=== Nobel Prize ===

In 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics. The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933. It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 &quot;for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen&quot; and Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac shared the 1933 Prize &quot;for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory&quot;.

It might well be asked why Born was not awarded the Prize in 1932, along with Heisenberg, and Bernstein proffers speculations on this matter. One of them relates to Jordan joining the Nazi Party on May 1, 1933, and becoming a stormtrooper. Jordan&#x27;s Party affiliations and Jordan&#x27;s links to Born may well have affected Born&#x27;s chance at the Prize at that time. Bernstein further notes that when Born finally won the Prize in 1954, Jordan was still alive, while the Prize was awarded for the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, attributable to Born alone.

Heisenberg&#x27;s reactions to Born for Heisenberg receiving the Prize for 1932 and for Born receiving the Prize in 1954 are also instructive in evaluating whether Born should have shared the Prize with Heisenberg. On November 25, 1933, Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a &quot;bad conscience&quot; that he alone had received the Prize &quot;for work done in Göttingen in collaboration – you, Jordan and I&quot;. Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan&#x27;s contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by &quot;a wrong decision from the outside&quot;.

In 1954, Heisenberg wrote an article honoring Max Planck for his insight in 1900. In the article, Heisenberg credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics, which were not &quot;adequately acknowledged in the public eye&quot;.

== Mathematical development ==

Once Heisenberg introduced the matrices for and , he could find their matrix elements in special cases by guesswork, guided by the correspondence principle. Since the matrix elements are the quantum mechanical analogs of Fourier coefficients of the classical orbits, the simplest case is the harmonic oscillator, where the classical position and momentum, and , are sinusoidal.

=== Harmonic oscillator ===

In units where the mass and frequency of the oscillator are equal to one (see nondimensionalization), the energy of the oscillator is
formula_9

The level sets of are the clockwise orbits, and they are nested circles in phase space. The classical orbit with energy is
formula_10

The old quantum condition dictates that the integral of over an orbit, which is the area of the circle in phase space, must be an integer multiple of the Planck constant. The area of the circle of radius is . So
formula_11
or, in natural units where , the energy is an integer.

The Fourier components of and are simple, and more so if they are combined into the quantities
formula_12
Both and have only a single frequency, and and can be recovered from their sum and difference.

Since has a classical Fourier series with only the lowest frequency, and the matrix element is the th Fourier coefficient of the classical orbit, the matrix for is nonzero only on the line just above the diagonal, where it is equal to . The matrix for is likewise only nonzero on the line below the diagonal, with the same elements. Thus, from and, reconstruction yields
formula_13
and
formula_14
which, up to the choice of units, are the Heisenberg matrices for the harmonic oscillator. Both matrices are Hermitian, since they are constructed from the Fourier coefficients of real quantities.

Finding and is direct, since they are quantum Fourier coefficients so they evolve simply with time,
formula_15

The matrix product of and is not hermitian, but has a real and imaginary part. The real part is one half the symmetric expression , while the imaginary part is proportional to the commutator
formula_16
It is simple to verify explicitly that in the case of the harmonic oscillator, is , multiplied by the identity.

It is likewise simple to verify that the matrix
formula_17
is a diagonal matrix, with eigenvalues .

=== Conservation of energy ===
The harmonic oscillator is an important case. Finding the matrices is easier than determining the general conditions from these special forms. For this reason, Heisenberg investigated the anharmonic oscillator, with Hamiltonian
formula_18

In this case, the and matrices are no longer simple off-diagonal matrices, since the corresponding classical orbits are slightly squashed and displaced, so that they have Fourier coefficients at every classical frequency. To determine the matrix elements, Heisenberg required that the classical equations of motion be obeyed as matrix equations,
formula_19

He noticed that if this could be done, then , considered as a matrix function of and , will have zero time derivative.
formula_20
where is the anticommutator,
formula_21

Given that all the off diagonal elements have a nonzero frequency; being constant implies that is diagonal.
It was clear to Heisenberg that in this system, the energy could be exactly conserved in an arbitrary quantum system, a very encouraging sign.

The process of emission and absorption of photons seemed to demand that the conservation of energy will hold at best on average. If a wave containing exactly one photon passes over some atoms, and one of them absorbs it, that atom needs to tell the others that they can&#x27;t absorb the photon anymore. But if the atoms are far apart, any signal cannot reach the other atoms in time, and they might end up absorbing the same photon anyway and dissipating the energy to the environment. When the signal reached them, the other atoms would have to somehow recall that energy. This paradox led Bohr, Kramers and Slater to abandon exact conservation of energy. Heisenberg&#x27;s formalism, when extended to include the electromagnetic field, was obviously going to sidestep this problem, a hint that the interpretation of the theory will involve wavefunction collapse.

=== Differentiation trick — canonical commutation relations ===

Demanding that the classical equations of motion are preserved is not a strong enough condition to determine the matrix elements. The Planck constant does not appear in the classical equations, so that the matrices could be constructed for many different values of and still satisfy the equations of motion, but with different energy levels.

So, in order to implement his program, Heisenberg needed to use the old quantum condition to fix the energy levels, then fill in the matrices with Fourier coefficients of the classical equations, then alter the matrix coefficients and the energy levels slightly to make sure the classical equations are satisfied. This is clearly not satisfactory. The old quantum conditions refer to the area enclosed by the sharp classical orbits, which do not exist in the new formalism.

The most important thing that Heisenberg discovered is how to translate the old quantum condition into a simple statement in matrix mechanics.

To do this, he investigated the action integral as a matrix quantity,
formula_22

There are several problems with this integral, all stemming from the incompatibility of the matrix formalism with the old picture of orbits. Which period should be used? &quot;Semiclassically&quot;, it should be either or , but the difference is order , and an answer to order is sought. The &quot;quantum&quot; condition tells us that is on the diagonal, so the fact that is classically constant tells us that the off-diagonal elements are zero.

His crucial insight was to differentiate the quantum condition with respect to . This idea only makes complete sense in the classical limit, where is not an integer but the continuous action variable , but Heisenberg performed analogous manipulations with matrices, where the intermediate expressions are sometimes discrete differences and sometimes derivatives.

In the following discussion, for the sake of clarity, the differentiation will be performed on the classical variables, and the transition to matrix mechanics will be done afterwards, guided by the correspondence principle.

In the classical setting, the derivative is the derivative with respect to of the integral which defines , so it is tautologically equal to 1.
formula_23
where the derivatives and should be interpreted as differences with respect to at corresponding times on nearby orbits, exactly what would be obtained if the Fourier coefficients of the orbital motion were differentiated. (These derivatives are symplectically orthogonal in phase space to the time derivatives and ).

The final expression is clarified by introducing the variable canonically conjugate to , which is called the angle variable : The derivative with respect to time is a derivative with respect to , up to a factor of ,
formula_24
So the quantum condition integral is the average value over one cycle of the Poisson bracket of and .

An analogous differentiation of the Fourier series of demonstrates that the off-diagonal elements of the Poisson bracket are all zero. The Poisson bracket of two canonically conjugate variables, such as and , is the constant value 1, so this integral really is the average value of 1; so it is 1, as we knew all along, because it is after all. But Heisenberg, Born and Jordan, unlike Dirac, were not familiar with the theory of Poisson brackets, so, for them, the differentiation effectively evaluated in coordinates.

The Poisson Bracket, unlike the action integral, does have a simple translation to matrix mechanics – it normally corresponds to the imaginary part of the product of two variables, the commutator.

To see this, examine the (antisymmetrized) product of two matrices and in the correspondence limit, where the matrix elements are slowly varying functions of the index, keeping in mind that the answer is zero classically.

In the correspondence limit, when indices , are large and nearby, while , are small, the rate of change of the matrix elements in the diagonal direction is the matrix element of the derivative of the corresponding classical quantity. So it is possible to shift any matrix element diagonally through the correspondence,
formula_25
where the right hand side is really only the th Fourier component of at the orbit near to this semiclassical order, not a full well-defined matrix.

The semiclassical time derivative of a matrix element is obtained up to a factor of by multiplying by the distance from the diagonal,
formula_26
since the coefficient is semiclassically the th Fourier coefficient of the th classical orbit.

The imaginary part of the product of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; can be evaluated by shifting the matrix elements around so as to reproduce the classical answer, which is zero.

The leading nonzero residual is then given entirely by the shifting. Since all the matrix elements are at indices which have a small distance from the large index position , it helps to introduce two temporary notations:
 for the matrices, and for the th Fourier components of classical quantities,
formula_27

Flipping the summation variable in the first sum from to , the matrix element becomes,
formula_28
and it is clear that the principal (classical) part cancels.

The leading quantum part, neglecting the higher order product of derivatives in the residual expression, is then equal to
formula_29
so that, finally,
formula_30
which can be identified with times the th classical Fourier component of the Poisson bracket.

Heisenberg&#x27;s original differentiation trick was eventually extended to a full semiclassical derivation of the quantum condition, in collaboration with Born and Jordan.
Once they were able to establish that
formula_31
this condition replaced and extended the old quantization rule, allowing the matrix elements of and for an arbitrary system to be determined simply from the form of the Hamiltonian.

The new quantization rule was &quot;assumed to be universally true&quot;, even though the derivation from the old quantum theory required semiclassical reasoning.
(A full quantum treatment, however, for more elaborate arguments of the brackets, was appreciated in the 1940s to amount to extending Poisson brackets to Moyal brackets.)

=== State vectors and the Heisenberg equation ===

To make the transition to standard quantum mechanics, the most important further addition was the quantum state vector, now written ,
which is the vector that the matrices act on. Without the state vector, it is not clear which particular motion the Heisenberg matrices are describing, since they include all the motions somewhere.

The interpretation of the state vector, whose components are written , was furnished by Born. This interpretation is statistical: the result of a measurement of the physical quantity corresponding to the matrix is random, with an average value equal to
formula_32
Alternatively, and equivalently, the state vector gives the probability amplitude for the quantum system to be in the energy state .

Once the state vector was introduced, matrix mechanics could be rotated to &quot;any basis&quot;, where the matrix need no longer be diagonal. The Heisenberg equation of motion in its original form states that evolves in time like a Fourier component,
formula_33
which can be recast in differential form
formula_34
and it can be restated so that it is true in an arbitrary basis, by noting that the matrix is diagonal with diagonal values ,
formula_35
This is now a matrix equation, so it holds in any basis. This is the modern form of the Heisenberg equation of motion.

Its formal solution is:
formula_36

All these forms of the equation of motion above say the same thing, that is equivalent to , through a basis rotation by the unitary matrix , a systematic picture elucidated by Dirac in his bra–ket notation.

Conversely, by rotating the basis for the state vector at each time by , the time dependence in the matrices can be undone. The matrices are now time independent, but the state vector rotates,
formula_37
This is the Schrödinger equation for the state vector, and this time-dependent change of basis amounts to transformation to the Schrödinger picture, with .

In quantum mechanics in the Heisenberg picture the state vector, does not change with time, while an observable satisfies the &quot;Heisenberg equation of motion&quot;,
The extra term is for operators such as
formula_38
which have an &quot;explicit time dependence&quot;, in addition to the time dependence from the unitary evolution discussed.

The Heisenberg picture does not distinguish time from space, so it is better suited to relativistic theories than the Schrödinger equation. Moreover, the similarity to classical physics is more manifest: the Hamiltonian equations of motion for classical mechanics are recovered by replacing the commutator above by the Poisson bracket (see also below). By the Stone–von Neumann theorem, the Heisenberg picture and the Schrödinger picture must be unitarily equivalent, as detailed below.

== Further results ==

Matrix mechanics rapidly developed into modern quantum mechanics, and gave interesting physical results on the spectra of atoms.

=== Wave mechanics ===

Jordan noted that the commutation relations ensure that &quot; acts as a differential operator&quot;.

The operator identity
formula_39
allows the evaluation of the commutator of with any power of , and it implies that
formula_40
which, together with linearity, implies that a &quot;P&quot;-commutator effectively differentiates any analytic matrix function of .

Assuming limits are defined sensibly, this extends to arbitrary functions−but the extension need not be made explicit until a certain degree of mathematical rigor is required,

Since is a Hermitian matrix, it should be diagonalizable, and it will be clear from the eventual form of that every real number can be an eigenvalue. This makes some of the mathematics subtle, since there is a separate eigenvector for every point in space.

In the basis where is diagonal, an arbitrary state can be written as a superposition of states with eigenvalues ,
formula_41
so that , and the operator multiplies each eigenvector by ,
formula_42

Define a linear operator which differentiates ,
formula_43
and note that
formula_44
so that the operator obeys the same commutation relation as . Thus, the difference between and must commute with ,
formula_45
so it may be simultaneously diagonalized with : its value acting on any eigenstate of is some function of the eigenvalue .

This function must be real, because both and are Hermitian,
formula_46
rotating each state by a phase , that is, redefining the phase of the wavefunction:
formula_47
The operator is redefined by an amount:
formula_48
which means that, in the rotated basis, is equal to .

Hence, there is always a basis for the eigenvalues of where the action of on any wavefunction is known:
formula_49
and the Hamiltonian in this basis is a linear differential operator on the state-vector components,
formula_50

Thus, the equation of motion for the state vector is but a celebrated differential equation,


Since is a differential operator, in order for it to be sensibly defined, there must be eigenvalues of which neighbors every given value. This suggests that the only possibility is that the space of all eigenvalues of is all real numbers, and that &quot; is , up to a phase rotation&quot;.

To make this rigorous requires a sensible discussion of the limiting space of functions, and in this space this is the Stone–von Neumann theorem: any operators and which obey the commutation relations can be made to act on a space of wavefunctions, with a derivative operator. This implies that a Schrödinger picture is always available.

Matrix mechanics easily extends to many degrees of freedom in a natural way. Each degree of freedom has a separate operator and a separate effective differential operator , and the wavefunction is a function of all the possible eigenvalues of the independent commuting variables.
formula_51

In particular, this means that a system of interacting particles in 3 dimensions is described by one vector whose components in a basis where all the are diagonal is a mathematical function of -dimensional space &quot;describing all their possible positions&quot;, effectively a &quot;much bigger collection of values&quot; than the mere collection of three-dimensional wavefunctions in one physical space. Schrödinger came to the same conclusion independently, and eventually proved the equivalence of his own formalism to Heisenberg&#x27;s.

Since the wavefunction is a property of the whole system, not of any one part, the description in quantum mechanics is not entirely local. The description of several quantum particles has them correlated, or entangled. This entanglement leads to strange correlations between distant particles which violate the classical Bell&#x27;s inequality.

Even if the particles can only be in just two positions, the wavefunction for particles requires complex numbers, one for each total configuration of positions. This is exponentially many numbers in , so simulating quantum mechanics on a computer requires exponential resources. Conversely, this suggests that it might be possible to find quantum systems of size which physically compute the answers to problems which classically require bits to solve. This is the aspiration behind quantum computing.

=== Ehrenfest theorem ===

For the time-independent operators and , so the Heisenberg equation above reduces to:
formula_52
where the square brackets denote the commutator. For a Hamiltonian which is , the and operators satisfy:
formula_53
where the first is classically the velocity, and second is classically the force, or potential gradient. These reproduce Hamilton&#x27;s form of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. In the Heisenberg picture, the and operators satisfy the classical equations of motion. You can take the expectation value of both sides of the equation to see that, in any state :
formula_54

So Newton&#x27;s laws are exactly obeyed by the expected values of the operators in any given state. This is Ehrenfest&#x27;s theorem, which is an obvious corollary of the Heisenberg equations of motion, but is less trivial in the Schrödinger picture, where Ehrenfest discovered it.

=== Transformation theory ===
In classical mechanics, a canonical transformation of phase space coordinates is one which preserves the structure of the Poisson brackets. The new variables , have the same Poisson brackets with each other as the original variables , . Time evolution is a canonical transformation, since the phase space at any time is just as good a choice of variables as the phase space at any other time.

The Hamiltonian flow is the canonical transformation:
formula_55

Since the Hamiltonian can be an arbitrary function of and , there are such infinitesimal canonical transformations corresponding to &quot;every classical quantity&quot; , where serves as the Hamiltonian to generate a flow of points in phase space for an increment of time ,
formula_56

For a general function on phase space, its infinitesimal change at every step under this map is
formula_57
The quantity is called the &quot;infinitesimal generator&quot; of the canonical transformation.

In quantum mechanics, the quantum analog is now a Hermitian matrix, and the equations of motion are given by commutators,
formula_58

The infinitesimal canonical motions can be formally integrated, just as the Heisenberg equation of motion were integrated,
formula_59
where and is an arbitrary parameter.

The definition of a quantum canonical transformation is thus an arbitrary unitary change of basis on the space of all state vectors. is an arbitrary unitary matrix, a complex rotation in phase space,
formula_60
These transformations leave the sum of the absolute square of the wavefunction components &quot;invariant&quot;, while they take states which are multiples of each other (including states which are imaginary multiples of each other) to states which are the &quot;same&quot; multiple of each other.

The interpretation of the matrices is that they act as &quot;generators of motions on the space of states&quot;.

For example, the motion generated by can be found by solving the Heisenberg equation of motion using as a Hamiltonian,
formula_61
These are translations of the matrix by a multiple of the identity matrix,
formula_62
This is the interpretation of the derivative operator : , &quot;the exponential of a derivative operator is a translation&quot; (so Lagrange&#x27;s shift operator).

The operator likewise generates translations in . The Hamiltonian generates &quot;translations in time&quot;, the angular momentum generates &quot;rotations in physical space&quot;, and the operator generates &quot;rotations in phase space&quot;.

When a transformation, like a rotation in physical space, commutes with the Hamiltonian, the transformation is called a symmetry (behind a degeneracy) of the Hamiltonian – the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of rotated coordinates is the same as the original Hamiltonian. This means that the change in the Hamiltonian under the infinitesimal symmetry generator vanishes,
formula_63

It then follows that the change in the generator under time translation also vanishes,
formula_64
so that the matrix is constant in time: it is conserved.

The one-to-one association of infinitesimal symmetry generators and conservation laws was discovered by Emmy Noether for classical mechanics, where the commutators are Poisson brackets, but the quantum-mechanical reasoning is identical. In quantum mechanics, any unitary symmetry transformation yields a conservation law, since if the matrix U has the property that
formula_65
so it follows that
formula_66
and that the time derivative of is zero – it is conserved.

The eigenvalues of unitary matrices are pure phases, so that the value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. Another way of saying this is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of . Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.

Symmetries which can be continuously connected to the identity are called &quot;continuous&quot;, and translations, rotations, and boosts are examples. Symmetries which cannot be continuously connected to the identity are &quot;discrete&quot;, and the operation of space-inversion, or parity, and charge conjugation are examples.

The interpretation of the matrices as generators of canonical transformations is due to Paul Dirac. The correspondence between symmetries and matrices was shown by Eugene Wigner to be complete, if antiunitary matrices which describe symmetries which include time-reversal are included.

=== Selection rules ===
It was physically clear to Heisenberg that the absolute squares of the matrix elements of , which are the Fourier coefficients of the oscillation, would yield the rate of emission of electromagnetic radiation.

In the classical limit of large orbits, if a charge with position and charge is oscillating next to an equal and opposite charge at position 0, the instantaneous dipole moment is , and the time variation of this moment translates directly into the space-time variation of the vector potential, which yields nested outgoing spherical waves.

For atoms, the wavelength of the emitted light is about 10,000 times the atomic radius, and the dipole moment is the only contribution to the radiative field, while all other details of the atomic charge distribution can be ignored.

Ignoring back-reaction, the power radiated in each outgoing mode is a sum of separate contributions from the square of each independent time Fourier mode of ,
formula_67

Now, in Heisenberg&#x27;s representation, the Fourier coefficients of the dipole moment are the matrix elements of . This correspondence allowed Heisenberg to provide the rule for the transition intensities, the fraction of the time that, starting from an initial state , a photon is emitted and the atom jumps to a final state ,
formula_68

This then allowed the magnitude of the matrix elements to be interpreted statistically: &quot;they give the intensity of the spectral lines, the probability for quantum jumps from the emission of dipole radiation&quot;.

Since the transition rates are given by the matrix elements of , wherever is zero, the corresponding transition should be absent. These were called the selection rules, which were a puzzle until the advent of matrix mechanics.

An arbitrary state of the hydrogen atom, ignoring spin, is labelled by , where the value of is a measure of the total orbital angular momentum and is its -component, which defines the orbit orientation. The components of the angular momentum pseudovector are
formula_69
where the products in this expression are independent of order and real, because different components of and commute.

The commutation relations of with all three coordinate matrices , , (or with any vector) are easy to find,
formula_70
which confirms that the operator generates rotations between the three components of the vector of coordinate matrices .

From this, the commutator of and the coordinate matrices , , can be read off,
formula_71

This means that the quantities and have a simple commutation rule,
formula_72

Just like the matrix elements of and for the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, this commutation law implies that these operators only have certain off diagonal matrix elements in states of definite ,
formula_73
meaning that the matrix takes an eigenvector of with eigenvalue to an eigenvector with eigenvalue . Similarly, decrease by one unit, while does not change the value of .

So, in a basis of states where and have definite values, the matrix elements of any of the three components of the position are zero, except when is the same or changes by one unit.

This places a constraint on the change in total angular momentum. Any state can be rotated so that its angular momentum is in the -direction as much as possible, where . The matrix element of the position acting on can only produce values of which are bigger by one unit, so that if the coordinates are rotated so that the final state is , the value of can be at most one bigger than the biggest value of that occurs in the initial state. So is at most .

The matrix elements vanish for , and the reverse matrix element is determined by Hermiticity, so these vanish also when : Dipole transitions are forbidden with a change in angular momentum of more than one unit.

=== Sum rules ===

The Heisenberg equation of motion determines the matrix elements of in the Heisenberg basis from the matrix elements of .
formula_74
which turns the diagonal part of the commutation relation into a sum rule for the magnitude of the matrix elements:
formula_75

This yields a relation for the sum of the spectroscopic intensities to and from any given state, although to be absolutely correct, contributions from the radiative capture probability for unbound scattering states must be included in the sum:
formula_76

<text>A punk zine (or punkzine) is a zine related to the punk subculture and hardcore punk music genre. Often primitively or casually produced, they feature punk literature, such as social commentary, punk poetry, news, gossip, music reviews and articles about punk rock bands or regional punk scenes.

==History==
===1970s: origins===

Starting in the 1970s, the DIY aesthetic of the punk subculture created a thriving underground press. Amateur magazines related to punk were inspired by the rock fanzines of the early 1970s, which were inspired by zines from the science fiction fan community. Perhaps the most influential of the fanzines to cross over from science fiction fandom to rock and, later, punk rock and new wave music was Greg Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot;, founded in 1970.

One of the earliest punk zines was &quot;Punk&quot;, founded in New York City by John Holmstrom, Ged Dunn and Legs McNeil. Debuting in January 1976, the zine championed the early New York underground music scene and helped associate the word &quot;punk&quot; with these bands, most notably the Ramones. Other early punkzines from the United States included &quot;Search &amp; Destroy&quot; (later &quot;REsearch&quot;), &quot;Flipside&quot; and &quot;Slash.&quot;

An early United Kingdom punk zine was &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot;, produced by Mark Perry, who also founded the band Alternative TV, in 1976. Perry produced the first photocopied issue of &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; in London after attending the Ramones concert on 4 July 1976 at the Roundhouse. Punk zines were produced in many European countries in subsequent years. The first Irish one was published in March 1977.

In Australia in 1977, inspired by the Saints and Radio Birdman, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker fused their respective first zines &quot;Plastered Press&quot; and &quot;Suicide Alley&quot; to launch &quot;Pulp&quot;; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, in 1980. Another early publication was &quot;Self Abuse&quot; first published in Sydney in December 1977.

===1980s===
The politically charged &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot; and the anarchist &quot;Profane Existence&quot; were notable punkzines that were founded in the 1980s. By that time, most local punk scenes had at least one punkzine. The magazine &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; chronicled thousands of underground publications and &quot;zines&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s.

In the 1980s, the punk self-publication scene was quickly expanding to include numerous different subcultures within the genre. For example, the birth of the Queercore movement: inspired by the desire for social change, the subculture was represented by zines that sought to accept those within the LGBT community who were also involved in punk and also had overwhelming themes of promoting individual rights. The topics discussed in the issues often ignited forums and chatrooms where readers could share their opinions. This genre of zine was self-sustaining and produced in a DIY manner. &quot;Queercore&quot; is often accredited to a Toronto-based zine entitled J.D.s, an abbreviation for &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot;, created by H. Quinn and co-published with Bruce Wayne. &quot;H.Q.s&quot; was a cut-and-paste-style zine that featured manifestos and dialogue about identifying as queer within the realms of the punk community. Other zines that instigated this movement are Chainsaw (punk zine), Outpunk, and Homocore. The queercore zines influenced the Riot Grrrl zines of the late 1980s and 1990s, as well.

===Riot Grrrl zines===
The &quot;Riot Grrrl&quot; movement emerged from the punk scene in the United States when women began to produce zines with feminist themes. The &quot;riot grrrl&quot; wave was influential for pinkzines as it called for women to publish and produce content in the male dominated culture. Featuring political issues from a personal standpoint, the zines arose in popularity amongst the underground world of punk. The format of the &quot;riot grrrl&quot; zines was similar to that of queercore zines, in that they were cut and paste and xeroxed with many featuring collages. Self-published punkzines from this era such as Bikini Kill, Girl Germs, Le Tigre, and &quot;Jigsaw&quot; were put out by members of riot grrrl bands who supported the notion of women learning to play music and feeling self-empowered. Other apparent themes in this category of zine include activism, social change, sexuality, body image, and the discussion of controversial topics such as racism and abuse.

<text>Licensed radio broadcasting in Ireland is one element of the wider media of Ireland, with 85% of the population listening to a licensed radio broadcasting service on any given day.

==History==

=== Ireland as a radio pioneer ===
Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian inventor and the father of long-distance radio transmission, had a significant connection to Ireland as a descendent of the influential Jameson family, and the country played a crucial role in his early radio experiments.

The earliest known radio broadcast in Ireland took place on 6 July 1898, when Marconi set up a wireless telegraphy link between Rathlin Island and Ballycastle. This communication system was established on behalf of Lloyd&#x27;s.

In 1907 Marconi International Marine Communication Company the world&#x27;s first transatlantic wireless telegraphy service in the world in Clifden. The station conducted the first successful transmission of the first commercial wireless messages across the Atlantic Ocean between Clifden and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. The station remained in operation until the late 1920s, when it was closed due to advancements in more powerful transatlantic wireless stations.

=== Modern Radio ===
A Morse code transmission on 24 April 1916 from the General Post Office in Dublin by the rebels during the Easter Rising is considered the first broadcast in Ireland. Regular radio broadcasting in Ireland began with 2RN&#x27;s test transmissions in 1925. 2RN has since become RTÉ Radio 1, which celebrated 90 years of uninterrupted broadcasting in January 2016, making it amongst the oldest continuously operating (if not the actual oldest), continuously public service radio station in Europe. RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta launched in 1972, and RTÉ Radio 2, now RTÉ 2FM, launched in 1979.

Commercial radio was outlawed in Ireland until 1989, leading to the development of Irish pirate radio. Upon legalisation, licences were advertised and awarded on a franchise system explained in the article for a national service and a network of regional services covering the country. These all took to the air during 1989 and 1990, and although the national service (Century) eventually failed, all the local services lasted until their licence was revoked, or still exist. Additional licences have been added on an erratic basis since the late 1990s.

An &quot;international&quot; service, Atlantic 252, also operated on 252kHz long wave between 1989 and 2002, although it was aimed solely at the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was never subject to the authority of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and was operated under RTÉ&#x27;s remit as a joint venture between RTÉ and CLT-UFA. After a short period as a sports station (TeamTalk), the frequencies reverted to sole RTÉ control and were used as an additional frequency for RTÉ Radio 1 until transmissions ceased in April 2023, with running costs cited as the reason. 

In Ireland, Community Radio has been active since the late 1970s. However, it took until 1994 before the Independent Radio and Television Commission established an 18-month community radio pilot project to explore and evaluate the potential offered by community broadcasting in an Irish context. This project went operational in 1995, when licenses were issued to eleven community and community of interest groups across the country. 2004 saw the establishment of CRAOL the Community Radio Forum of Ireland.

==Licensing==
Aside from the stations operated by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), radio stations in Ireland operate under sound broadcasting contracts issued by the Coimisiún na Meán. This body replaced the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in 2023 and supervises and regulates RTÉ, commercial Independent National, Regional, and Local Radio stations, as well as the non-profit Community Radio stations, Institutional Services and Temporary Services.

==Transmission==
All stations broadcast on FM, and RTÉ Radio 1 also broadcast on 252 kHz long wave until April 2023, which was mainly intended for reception outside Ireland. RTÉ radio services are also available free-to-air on digital satellite, as is Newstalk, and a number of recently licensed services or applicants have used satellite transmission to homes as part of the licence applications.

Medium wave (AM) licences were issued for new commercial stations for Limerick and Galway in 2002, although these services never reached the air and were later withdrawn. A medium wave licence was awarded for quasi-national religious service Spirit Radio.

During 2006, a group, Choice FM, applied for and received permission to broadcasting on MW in the Dublin area over a period of thirty days. The &quot;easy listening&quot; radio station relayed its FM programming on 1278 kHz MW and operated opt-out programming at various times. The group is said to be interested in obtaining one of the four MW channels that are allocated to the Dublin area, however the future schedule for licensing does not indicate that any MW licences will be offered on a permanent basis.

During 2007, a radio station called The Rock obtained a temporary classic rock music service. The station broadcast on 94.9 FM and also on 1278 kHz MW. The Rock was operated by the same group that operated Choice FM during 2005 and 2006, although different MW facilities were used by the group during 2007.

==Ownership==
Raidió Teilifís Éireann and Bauer Media Audio Ireland dominate the national radio broadcasting sector. RTÉ operates Radio 1, 2FM, the Irish Language station RnaG, and classical station Lyric FM. The two national commercial stations are both owned by Bauer Media Audio Ireland - Today FM and Newstalk.

Ownership rules were relaxed in the mid-2000s, which saw several companies buying up local and national commercial stations, including Scottish Radio Holdings, who sold their stations to Emap, who eventually sold on those stations to Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Communicorp. The ownership of commercial radio in Ireland is largely by two companies; Bauer Media Audio Ireland which owns two national, one regional and two local stations, and News Broadcasting, which owns six local stations.

The rest of the stations, mostly small services, are generally owned by local businesses, with notable proprietors of stakes including Thomas Crosbie Holdings, the Roman Catholic Church and the Mid Western Area Health Board.

Until 31 March 2021, RTÉ also broadcast six DAB stations. These stations are now available via other digital platforms.

*Radio Maria Ireland - religious radio on the digital terrestrial platform

===Multi-city and county radio===
Broadcasting to Greater Dublin (Dublin city and county; limited parts of County Kildare, County Meath and County Wicklow), Cork city and county, Limerick city and county, Galway city and county and County Clare:
*Classic Hits Radio - music service for over-45s
*Spirit Radio - Christian and religious service aimed at over-15s; launched on 27 January 2011 with FM frequencies in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. In July 2012 the station as required by its licence introduced its planned AM transmission on 549 kHz medium wave to increase coverage to nationwide.

Beat 102-103 was the first to air, and was a pilot for the rest of the system.

In 2011, i102-104 and i105-107 merged to become one iRadio entity.

==Independent local radio==
There are 25 commercial stations (Independent Local Radio - ILR) licensed on a regional franchise basis. Often several counties of Ireland are covered by one station only, but Dublin and Cork have several. The majority of the ILR stations collectively own the sales house, Independent Radio Sales.

===Dublin ILRs===
Except for the two original ILR licenses - 98FM and FM104 - each additional ILR license in Dublin was awarded for a specific format, intending on meeting demands which it was felt that 98FM and FM104 were not catering to. The majority of stations heard in Dublin can also be heard in North East Kildare, South Meath and North Wicklow.

*98FM - general service

==Community radio==
Community Radio covers specific local communities or communities of interest. These operate on a non-commercial basis. In Ireland, the BAI requires that community radio stations subscribe to the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (AMARC) Community Radio Charter for Europe. Community radio in Ireland is represented by CRAOL. Currently there are 20 fully licensed community radio stations on air in Ireland, with offers of contracts from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, while there are 42 stations in the process of obtaining a licence.

*BCRfm Ballina Community radio - Ballina, County Mayo
*Eden 102.5 fm - Edenderry, County Offaly

==Special interest services==
Special interest services resemble ILRs in most ways, but must be of specialist interest — e.g. heavier local interest content, or specialist music. Only one such station is licensed, Dublin City FM, which brand themselves as 103.2 Dublin City FM on-air, and DUB CITY on RDS. Dublin City FM are essentially a community station with specialist traffic reports around rush-hour periods.

==Institutional services==

The BAI may also issue licenses to institutions, such as hospitals and colleges, for the provision of low-powered FM services. At present, there are five such stations in operation; all of them are hospital radio stations, with the existing student radio stations operating under community radio or temporary licenses.
*CUH FM Hospital Radio - (102.0FM) - Cork University Hospital, Cork, County Cork.
*Mater Hospital Radio - Mater Hospital, Dublin, County Dublin.
*Dreamtime 92.6FM - S.O.S. Kilkenny Ltd, Callan Road, Kilkenny, Co. Kilkenny.
*South Tipperary General Hospital Radio 93.7FM - South Tipperary General and Maternity Hospital, Clonmel, County Tipperary.
*St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital Radio - St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin.

==Temporary services==
Stations may also be licensed to operate for shorter periods, with temporary licenses allowing stations to operate for up to thirty days in a given twelve-month period. These licenses may be used by stations providing a service to coincide with local, cultural and sporting events or festivals. Another group of stations to avail of this type of license are those that are being run as pilot projects; successful stations may later be established as Community Radio stations, or run for a permanent license.

One such temporary licence station was Sunrise Radio, which broadcast poly-lingual programming in the Dublin area for several months from March 2006. While its licence was renewed for the following year, it was not made permanent, and the broadcast frequency later allocated to another station.

==Defunct stations==
===RTÉ radio===
*Atlantic 252 - a joint venture with RTL, eventually failed financially.
*RTÉ FM3 - Classical music/arts service, had existed prior to the launch of Lyric FM. FM3 time-shared the same national FM network as RnaG, resulting in limited broadcasting hours.
*RTÉ Radio Cork (was originally &#x27;RTÉ Cork Local Radio&#x27;, changed name in 1989 to &#x27;Cork 89FM&#x27;, and relaunched again in 1994 as &#x27;RTÉ Radio Cork&#x27;) - an opt-out of Radio 1 for the Cork area on medium wave and secondary FM transmitters, closed in 1999 due to declining interest.
*RTÉ mobile Community Radio station - existed during the late 1970s and 1980s, this mobile station provided temporary community radio services to towns and cities around the country.

*CKR FM and Radio Kilkenny - franchises redrawn at end of contract, Kildare area awarded to KFM, Carlow and Kilkenny to KCLR. Gentrification of Kildare by Dublin commuters led Carlow to be closer aligned with Kilkenny in the eyes of the BAI, hence the changing of the franchise areas
*Tipperary Mid-West Radio - held a very small franchise for South West Tipperary. Its franchise was merged with the rest of Tipperary franchise (held by Tipp FM). The station continues, being re-licensed as a Community Radio station.
*North West Radio - subsidiary of Mid West Radio; replaced by Ocean FM at end of contract.
*Easy 103 - held a licence for part of Wicklow and Horizon Radio held a licence for north Wicklow. These two stations merged to become East Coast FM.

===Radio Oglaigh na h-Éireann===
Radio Oglaigh na h-Éireann () was established in 1962 to provide a short wave service to Irish Defence Forces serving in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Congo. Daily broadcasts were made on 17.544 MHz at 17:30 UTC, using a transmitter located at the Curragh Camp. Programmes, which were provided by Radio Éireann, included news, sports results, music and drama, including &quot;The Kennedys of Castleross&quot;. The service was discontinued after several years, when the Irish peacekeeping mission in Congo terminated.
