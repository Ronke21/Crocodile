<text>Inje County () is a county in Gangwon Province, South Korea. It has the lowest population density of any South Korean county. The county seat is Inje-eup, which located near the center of the county.

==History==
Inje is located in the north of Gangwon Province. Inje County has been called multiple names throughout its history. It was first known as Jeojokhyeon in the Goguryeo Kingdom, then Heejaehyeon in the Silla Kingdom, and Inje in the Goryeo Dynasty. The area was then known as Youngsohyeon and once again later on became Inje in the Joseon Dynasty. It was finally raised to the status of Inje county in August of 1896. At the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, Korea was split into 13 distinctive administrative zones, and Inje County was located in Kangwon Province, and for a short time was under the administration of North Korea. After the Partition of Korea, this historical province was split in half and Inje County fell under the jurisdiction of South Korea.
===Korean War===

The Republic of Korea Army ROK) 5th Infantry Division recaptured Inje town in Operation Rugged in April 1951 as the UN Forces advanced to the &quot;Kansas Line&quot;, north of the 38th Parallel.

Inje town was lost again to the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army during the Fifth Phase Offensive in late April 1951 and was recaptured in the UN May-June 1951 counteroffensive.

In 1951 the US Marine Corps 1st Medical Battalion operated a field hospital in Inje town.

The 40th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for the defense of the &quot;Kansas Line&quot; from the 24th Infantry Division from February 1952 supported by the ROK 3rd Infantry Division.

After the war ended, Inje County continued to be a strategic location for the military. The Korea Combat Training Center is located there. The Republic of Korea Army&#x27;s III Corps headquarters and its subordinate units are scattered in bases throughout the county.

==Environment==
Inje is located in the Taebaek Mountains and has a landscape dominated by flora. Many species inhabit several areas of the county, not only mountains but rivers also.

===Fauna===
* Asiatic Black Bear : In Korea, the Asiatic Black Bear can be found in the areas of Paekdusan, Seoraksan, and Jirisan, but it is becoming increasingly rare in South Korea.
* Musk deer : Among the Musk deer in the northern hemisphere, this species in the North-East is divided into seven subspecies. This subspecies found in the mountains around Mokpo and Jeonranamdo is also reported to be distributed Manchuria, Amur, Ussuri and Eastern Siberia as well as South Korea.

===Flora===
* Senecio koreanus : The Senecio Koreanus is a Korean Endemic Species.
* Carex chordorhiza : The Carex Chordorhiza is a perennial plant growing with sphagnum in a swamp, at first grows straight and then crawls laterally to take root. From its joint it grows a flower stem of up to 20 cm. Its leaves are flat and 1~1.5 cm wide with colors of gray and green. The heads are egg-like and numbered 2~4 which are 5~7 cm long. Male flowers come out upward but female ones downward without any bracts.
* Megaleranthis saniculifolia : Megaleranthis Saniculifolia is also a Korean Endemic Species and clings to Ranunculaceae. It inhabits the Jeombongsan, Sobaeksan, Jirisan and Taebaeksan areas. Living in the swamps or ridges in deep mountains, the perennial plant sprouts in stubbles. It&#x27;s between 30 and 40 cm tall. Leaves come from the root of the plant and are divided into three parts at the end, a long leafstalk may be split into two or three parts again.

==Geography==
Among the basic local governments in Korea, it ranks second in terms of area after Hongcheon and most of Inje-gun on the 38th parallel belonged to the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. Also the remaining areas were incorporated into Shinnam-myeon and Naeyeon, Hongcheon-gun. After the Korean War, most of the borders of Gangwon-do went north and became Inje-gun, but the inner side was not restored and remained under the jurisdiction of Hongcheon-gun. There are many famous hills, such as Jinbu-ryeong, Misiryeong, Hangyeryeong, Eunbi-ryeong, and Gom-Bae-ryeong. Although it is in the Yeongseo area, it is a point connecting Yeongseo and Yeongdong, so the rent is inevitable. It is also sad that it took 102 steps (which has now been disbanded) to go to Gangwon Province at all, but it is natural that it is a very difficult area to serve.

The dwelling is formed on a narrow flatland along the river, and the Inbukcheon River, which runs through Naerincheon Stream, Seohwa, and Wontong area, meets in Inje-eup and flows into Soyangho Lake.

Inje-gun was Chuncheon because it was located in the Soyanggang River basin in the northern region, and its language also uses a Yeongseo dialect similar to Chuncheon. .[8] However, it is difficult to see it as a living area in Chuncheon at present, but the road to go quickly to the construction of the Soyanggang Dam has been submerged, and in the midst of this, the expansion of 44th street has led to active exchanges between Hongcheon - Inje - Sokcho. Expansion Hongcheon - Inje - Sokcho It can be seen as an extended East Seoul living area.

Like the front area of Gangwon-do, it is very cold in winter. The average annual temperature is 10,1 °C, the average temperature of January, the coldest month, is -5,2 °C, the average temperature of August, the coldest month is 23,3 °C, and the lowest temperature ever recorded in January 1981 is -25, 9 °C, the highest temperature ever recorded on January is -25,9 °C all-time, 37,7 °C on August 1, 2018. The average annual precipitation is 1,210 mm.

Located on the border of Mt. [9] And on January 8, 2021, -29.1 °C was unofficially recorded at Hyangrobong, making it the coldest in the country.

Instead, you might think summer is cool, but it&#x27;s not at all. It would be better than the rear area, but even in summer, as long as it doesn&#x27;t rain, 30 °C is so hot that it&#x27;s standard. As mentioned above, during the heatwave in 2018, 37.7 °C was recorded. Think of it as a typical continental climate.

==Climate==
Inje has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
==Daecheong peak==
Daecheong Peak is the highest peak in the Mt. Seorak ranges and is located near at the boundary of Inje county and Yangyang county with an altitude of 1,708m.

The beautiful snow scenes around Daecheong peak are widely known. Inje county is quite cold from early November, with snow falling around its higher peaks. In 2007, the first heavy snow of the year was recorded as early as 16 November.

==Tourism==
Inje is a modest tourist destination for outdoor activities. It is home to the highest bungee jump in South Korea. It also host the Inje Speedium Resort Circuit.

==Ice fishing festival==
Because of its cold climate, many ice-fishing festivals often occur in Inje and the wider Gangwon-do area. However, the ice fishing in Inje is one of the main attractions in winter with 6,000 tourists per weekday and over 10,000 on weekends.

<doc id="393162" wikidata="Q1431729" url="?curid=393162" title="Council of Four Lands">
<text>The Council of Four Lands (, &quot;Va&#x27;ad Arba&#x27; Aratzot&quot;) was the central body of Jewish authority in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the second half of the 16th century to 1764, located in Lublin. The Council&#x27;s first law is recorded as having been passed in 1580. Seventy delegates from local &quot;kehillot&quot; met to discuss taxation and other issues important to the Jewish community. The &quot;four lands&quot; were Greater Poland, Little Poland, Galicia (with Podolia) and Volhynia. The earliest form of the Council was organized in 1514 by Sigismund I the Old and Abraham of Bohemia was put in charge of it.

In Polish it was referred to as the Jewish [[Sejm (disambiguation)|Sejm]] (). In Latin it was referred to as the Jewish General Congress (, or ).

The terms &quot;Council of Three Lands&quot; and &quot;Council of Five Lands&quot; and more have also been used for the same body. In 1623 the Jewish communities from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania withdrew from the &quot;Council of Four Lands&quot; and established &quot;the Council of the Land of Lithuania&quot; (Va’ad Medinat Lita, sometimes translated as simply &quot;the Council of Lithuania&quot;.)

==Place in Jewish European life==

The great number of the Jewish population of Poland, its importance in the industrial life of the country, and the peculiarities of the political and class organization of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were the reasons why the Jews of Poland formed a separate class enjoying liberal autonomy within the sphere of their communal and spiritual interests, the outcome of which was their exemplary communal organization. A Jewish community, with its administrative, judicial, religious, and charitable institutions, constituted a unit of self-government. The term &quot;Kahal&quot; denoted both the community (a community was also known as a Kahilah Kadisha or Holy Community) and the autonomous communal administration, the two concepts being identical. The administrative functions: the assessment of state and communal taxes, the supervision of charitable institutions, etc. of the &quot;Kahal&quot; were performed by elective &quot;Kahal&quot; elders, while its rabbis (&quot;doctores Judæorum&quot;) had charge of religious and judicial affairs.

==Number of delegates and frequency of meetings==
During the second half of the seventeenth century the sessions of the Council occurred once or twice a year, more frequently at Yaroslav than at Lublin. The number of delegates cannot be exactly ascertained. One source notes that one representative to the Council was elected from each &quot;Kahal&quot;, and that to these &quot;Kahal&quot; delegates were added the six leading rabbis of Poland. It appears from the &quot;Kahal pinkeses&quot; that only the most important &quot;Kahals&quot; of each region sent their delegates to the Council.

The capitals (Poznań, Kraków, Lwów, and Ostrog) of the &quot;four lands&quot; each sent two or even more delegates. The signatures of fifteen to twenty-five delegates—though often the signatures of the six rabbis only—are usually found attached to the extant decisions of the wa&#x27;ads. The total number of delegates, together with the rabbis, evidently reached thirty.

In the eighteenth century the operations of the Council became more and more limited; its sessions took place less regularly, mostly at Jaroslaw. One of the last important congresses was that held at Jaroslaw in the fall of 1753. Among other matters considered was the famous dispute between the rabbis Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybeschutz over the Shabbethaian movement, resulting in the latter&#x27;s acquittal on the charge of heresy in 1753. However, this ruling was later overturned by the Council in 1756, when Eybeschutz was placed under ban.

Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Shmuel of Lublin states in the introduction to his book &quot;Yad Eliyahu&quot; that he remembers attending meetings of the Council of Four Lands as a child. He writes, &quot;During my youth I was raised among many people of our nation, within the holy community of Lublin. In my days there was a meeting of scholars, the wise men of Yisrael, during the Gramitz Fairs every year... I imbibed their words thirstily...&quot;

In 1764 the Polish Diet ordered the discontinuation of Jewish general congresses (Vol. Legum, vii. 50) and the activity of the Council of Four Lands came to an end. The reason for the Diet&#x27;s decision was that the Council had failed to deliver the taxes it had collected. The subsequent partition of Poland among Russia, Austria, and Prussia, changing, as it did, the whole &quot;Kahal&quot; system, was unfavorable to the existence of such central autonomous bodies as the Council.

==Activity==
Its activity may be divided into four branches:
#Legislative
#Administrative
#Judicial
#Spiritual and cultural.

<doc id="393169" wikidata="Q171348" url="?curid=393169" title="Crown of the Kingdom of Poland">
<text>The Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (; ) was a political and legal concept formed in the 14th century in the Kingdom of Poland, assuming unity, indivisibility and continuity of the state. Under this idea, the state was no longer seen as the patrimonial property of the monarch or dynasty, but became a common good of the political community of the kingdom. This notion allowed the state to maintain stability even during periods of interregnum and paved the way for a unique political system in Poland, characterized by a noble-based parliament and the free election of the monarch. Additionally, the concept of the Crown extended beyond existing borders, asserting that previously lost territories still rightfully belonged to it. The term &quot;Crown of the Kingdom of Poland&quot; also referred to all the lands under the rule of the Polish king. This meaning became especially significant after the union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, when it began to be commonly used to denote the Polish part of the joint Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The idea of the Crown in Central Europe first appeared in Bohemia and Hungary, from where the model was taken by kings Ladislaus the Short and Casimir III the Great to strengthen their power. During the reign of Louis the Great in Poland, who spent most of his time in Hungary, as well as during the interregnum following his death and the regency during the minority of his daughter Jadwiga, the idea was adopted by the lords of the kingdom to emphasize their own role as co-responsible for the state.

== The development of the concept of &quot;corona regni&quot; in Poland ==

=== External influences ===
The concept of &quot;corona regni&quot; first emerged in early 12th-century England. By the 13th century, when it had fully developed, the term &quot;corona regni Angliae&quot; signified the inalienable and enduring royal dignity, authority, and rights, primarily encompassing the king’s judicial power and the state as a whole, including territories that had been lost. Similar developments occurred in other European regions, each shaped by local conditions. In France, the term appeared slightly later and initially referred mainly to the royal domain but also extended to the lands held by royal vassals. In Aragon, the Crown denoted a collection of kingdoms and territories united chiefly by their shared ruler, the King of Aragon.

For Poland, the significant development was the emergence of the concept of &quot;corona regni&quot; in Hungary in the late 12th century. Initially, it represented the kingdom as a territorial entity linked to the Árpád dynasty, heirs to St. Stephen&#x27;s crown. The shift came with the twilight of the Anjou dynasty, as the diet legitimized the succession through the female line. During the rule of Sigismund of Luxembourg the Holy Crown was finally distinguished from the King, and the Hungarian estates emphasized the ruler’s obligations to the Crown. By the 15th century, the Crown gained legal personality, standing above both King and Estates, becoming the true sovereign.

In Bohemia, the concept of the &quot;corona regni&quot; emerged primarily in connection with the territorial expansion and consolidation of the state. The Luxemburg dynasty&#x27;s unsuccessful pursuit of the Polish throne underscored the necessity of uniting the Silesian principalities with the Bohemian crown. In 1348, Charles IV formalized the feudal structure of the state and introduced the notion of the &quot;corona regni Bohemiae&quot;, incorporating the Silesian and Upper Lusatian territories bounding them to the perpetual Crown.

=== Idea of the Kingdom ===

The history of Poland as an entity has been traditionally traced to , when the pagan prince Mieszko I and the West Polans adopted Christianity. The Baptism of Poland established the first true Polish state, though the process was begun by Mieszko&#x27;s Piast ancestors. His son and successor, Bolesław I the Brave, Duke of Poland, became the first crowned King of Poland in 1025. And although his son and successor Mieszko II was forced to relinquish the crown, as was his great-grandson Boleslaw II the Bold, the idea of a kingdom survived. Even during the period of deep partition and the collapse of the central ducal power, Poland was still regarded as a kingdom, and the Piast princes, ruling the various provinces, as members of a royal dynasty and princes of Poland. 

A special role was played by Kraków, which was regarded as the main city of the kingdom, as the Wawel Cathedral held the royal jewels. Also important was the cult of Saint Stanislaus Bishop of Kraków, who was presented as the patron saint of the kingdom and its unification. A unified ecclesiastical metropolis headed by the Archbishop of Gniezno also played an important role; its boundaries coincided with those of the kingdom. Gniezno, as the second centre of the state, and the place of coronation, nurtured the cult of the second patron saint, St Adalbert. His influence, however, was less. 

In 1295, the Duke of Greater Poland Przemysł II, although his power did not extend to Kraków, and was crowned king in Gniezno Cathedral, as the first Piast since 1076. He was, however, assassinated a year later. He was succeeded by Wenceslas II, King of Bohemia, who from 1291 ruled Lesser Poland, conquered Greater Poland and in 1300 was crowned King of Poland in Gniezno. This meant the loss of central power for the Piast dynasty. This situation did not last long, however, as Wenceslas II died in 1305, followed by his son and successor, Wenceslas III, in 1306. The Duke of Kuyavia, Władysław Łokietek, managed to occupy first Lesser Poland and then Greater Poland, and made efforts to be crowned by the Pope. In 1320, the Archbishop of Gniezno crowned him king in Kraków, which formally did not infringe on the rights of the Přemyslids&#x27; successor, King John of Bohemia, who still considered himself king of Poland. Władysław&#x27;s successor Casimir III the Great was also crowned in Kraków in 1333. 

Casimir, like his father, considered himself the inherent ruler of the kingdom, the heir of the ancient Bolesławs. He strove to extend his power over the remaining Piast princes and to regain all the lands ruled by the former kings of Poland. The Silesian princes were referred to in Poland as &quot;duces Poloniae&quot;, although they paid homage to the Bohemian Crown. Casimir also abandoned the coat of arms of the Kuyavia line of the Piasts, a hybrid of eagle and lion, in favour of a crowned white eagle, which was also the symbol of the Kingdom. At the congress of Visegrad in 1335, Casimir bought off John of Bohemia claims to the title of king of Poland. This allowed for the expansion of the semantic scope of the term &quot;Kingdom of Poland,&quot; () which was often interpreted in a particularistic manner and limited only to Greater Poland. From that moment, in a territorial sense, it began to denote all the lands currently under the king&#x27;s rule, and in an ideological sense, all the territories that once belonged to the Piast dynasty. Particularly noteworthy was the situation of Ruthenia, which was conquered by Casimir III. Formally, it was a separate kingdom, on whose throne Casimir sat as the heir of his relative, Yuri II Boleslav of the Piast dynasty. 

The king, however, regarded himself as a patrimonial ruler who could freely manage the kingdom and its lands. An expression of this attitude was the appointment of his nephew, King Louis the Great of Hungary, as his successor, rather than any of the numerous male representatives of the Piast dynasty. In his testament, he bequeathed a significant portion of the borderlands to his grandson, Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania from the House of Griffins. However, the court annulled this provision after Louis&#x27;s coronation, as it fragmented the kingdom&#x27;s territory. This was an open challenge to the ruler&#x27;s claim of having the full freedom to manage the territory and resources of the state.

=== Idea of the Crown ===

The concept of &quot;Corona Regni&quot; appears in the documents of Casimir the Great only three times, and all three documents were produced by foreign chanceries in the king&#x27;s name. This idea, which limited the monarch&#x27;s power, gained popularity only after his death. The annulment of Casimir the Great&#x27;s testament in 1370 was essentially the first act undertaken in the name of the interests of the Crown. Ludwik was initially inclined to recognize the will, but strong opposition forced him to refer the matter to the court, which ruled that the ruler could not diminish the territory of the Crown of the Kingdom, a decision that Ludwik accepted. Similarly, the new king, Louis the Great, committed himself to reclaiming the lost territories not for himself, but for the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, during his coronation. Jan Radlica was the first royal chancellor who stopped referring to himself as &quot;of Kraków&quot; or &quot;of the court&quot; chancellor and began to use in 1381 the title &quot;regni Poloniae supremus cancellarius&quot; (supreme chancellor of the Kingdom of Poland).

The concept of the Crown being the real sovereign began to be promoted by the elites of Lesser Poland, who saw it as a way to elevate their role. This was facilitated by the rule of a foreign king, the regency in Poland by his mother, Elizabeth, as well as disputes over the succession after his death, which resulted in a woman, Queen Jadwiga, ascending the Polish throne. In the perception of the time, this violated the old laws and required the consent of the lords. 

The interregnum following the death of Ludwik in 1382, which ended with the coronation of Jadwiga in 1384, was evidence of the vitality of the Crown of the Kingdom. During this period, the magnates (&quot;regnicolae regni Poloniae&quot;) managed the affairs of the state, avoiding a bloody civil war and successfully leading to the coronation of new ruler. Moreover, the basis of power began to rest on an agreement between the dynasty and the kingdom&#x27;s community. The nobles respected the natural right of Louis&#x27;s daughters to the throne, but this right was conditional upon adherence to the oaths and obligations made by the ruler to the Crown of the Kingdom.

===Union of Krewo===

The Union of Krewo was a set of prenuptial agreements made at Kreva Castle on August 13, 1385, between Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila and Polish lords, who were offering him the hand of Queen Jadwiga of Poland. Once Jogaila confirmed the prenuptial agreements on August 14, 1385, Poland and Lithuania formed a personal union. The agreements included the adoption of Christianity, repatriation of lands lost by the Crown. Jogaila also pledged to permanently attach his Lithuanian and Ruthenian lands to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (&quot;terras suas Lithuaniae et Rusie Corone Regni Poloniae perpetuo aplicare)&quot;, the clause which formed the personal union. After being baptized at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on February 15, 1386, Jogaila began to formally use the name Władysław. Three days after his baptism, the marriage between Jadwiga and Władysław II Jagiełło took place. Over the next few years, the Lithuanian princes from the Gediminid dynasty paid homage to Jogaila, himself a Lithuanian and Gediminid, his wife Jadwiga, and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.

The union concluded at Krewo was not an ordinary personal union, common in Europe at that time, precisely because one party was the &quot;Corona Regni&quot;, that is, the community of the Kingdom of Poland, and not a dynasty or ruler, as was the case with the agreement between Casimir the Great and Louis the Great, which elevated the latter to the throne. Both Jogaila and Jadwiga were elected to the Polish throne by the nobles; their natural rights to the throne were weak, and their power rested solely on the agreement between them and the Crown of the Kingdom. According to Robert I. Frost, the aim of the Union of Krewo was not the annexation of Lithuania by Poland, but its incorporation into the community of the kingdom, that is, the Crown.

===Union of Lublin===
The Union of Lublin created the single state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on July 1, 1569 with a real union between the Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Before then, the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania only had a personal union. The Union of Lublin also made the Crown an elective monarchy; this ended the Jagiellonian dynasty once Henry de Valois was elected on May 16, 1573 as monarch.

On May 30, 1574, two months after Henry de Valois was crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on February 22, 1574, he was made King of France, and was crowned King of France on February 13, 1575. He left the throne of the Crown on May 12, 1575, two months after he was crowned King of France. Anna Jagiellon was elected after him.

===Constitution of 1791===
The Constitution of May 3, 1791 is the second-oldest, codified national constitution in history, and the oldest codified national constitution in Europe; the oldest being the United States Constitution. It was called the Government Act (&quot;Ustawa Rządowa&quot;) Drafting for it began on October 6, 1788, and lasted 32 months. Stanisław II Augustus was the principal author of the Constitution, and he wanted the Crown to be a constitutional monarchy, similar to the one in Great Britain. On May 3, 1791, the Great Sejm convened, and they read and adopted the new constitution. It enfranchised the bourgeoisie, separated the government into three branches, abolished liberum veto, and stopped the abuses of the Repnin Sejm.

It made Poland a constitutional monarchy with the King as the head of the executive branch with his cabinet of ministers, called the Guardians of the Laws. The legislative branch was bicameral with an elected Sejm and an appointed Senate; the King was given the power to break ties in the Senate, and the head of the Sejm was the Sejm Marshal. The Crown Tribunal, the highest appellate court in the Crown, was reformed. The Sejm would elect their judges for the Sejm Court (the Crown&#x27;s parliamentary court) from their deputies (&quot;posłowie&quot;).

The Government Act angered Catherine II who believed that Poland needed permission from the Russian Empire for any political reform; she argued that Poland had fallen prey to radical Jacobinism that was prominent in France at the time. Russia invaded the Commonwealth in 1792. The Constitution was in place for less than 19 months; it was annulled by the Grodno Sejm.

==Politics==
The creation of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland was a milestone in the evolution of Polish statehood and the European identity. It represented the concept of the Polish kingdom (nation) as distinctly separate from the person of the monarch. The introduction of the concept marked the transformation of the Polish government from a patrimonial monarchy (a hereditary monarchy) to a &quot;quasi-constitutional monarchy&quot; (&quot;monarchia stanowa&quot;) in which power resided in the nobility, the clergy and (to some extent) the working class, also referred to as an &quot;elective monarchy&quot;.

A related concept that evolved soon afterward was that of Rzeczpospolita (&quot;Commonwealth&quot;), which was an alternate to the Crown as a name for the Polish state after the Treaty of Lublin in 1569. The Crown of the Kingdom of Poland was also related to other symbols of Poland, such as the capital (Kraków), the Polish coat of arms and the flag of Poland.

===Geography===
The concept of the Crown also had geographical aspects, particularly related to the indivisibility of the Polish Crown&#x27;s territory. It can be also seen as a unit of administrative division, the territories under direct administration of the Polish state from the Middle Ages to the late 18th century (currently part of Poland, Ukraine and some border counties of Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Slovakia, and Romania, among others). Parts formed part at the early Kingdom of Poland, then, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until its final collapse in 1795.

At the same time, the Crown also referred to all lands that the Polish state (not the monarch) could claim to have the right to rule over, including those that were not within Polish borders.

The term distinguishes those territories federated with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania () from various fiefdom territories (which enjoyed varying degrees of or semi-independence from the King), such as the Duchy of Prussia () and the Duchy of Courland ().

Prior to the 1569 Union of Lublin, Crown territories may be understood as those of the Kingdom of Poland proper, inhabited by Poles, or as other areas under the sovereignty of the Polish king (such as Royal Prussia) or the szlachta. With the Union of Lublin, however, most of present-day Ukraine (which had a negligible Polish population and had until then been governed by Lithuania), passed under Polish administration, thus becoming Crown territory.

During that period, a term for a Pole from the Crown territory was &quot;koroniarz&quot; (plural: &quot;koroniarze&quot;) – or Crownlander(s) in English – derived from &quot;Korona&quot; – the Crown.

Depending on context, the Polish &quot;Crown&quot; may also refer to &quot;The Crown&quot;, a term used to distinguish the personal influence and private assets of the Commonwealth&#x27;s current monarch from government authority and property. It often meant a distinction between persons loyal to the elected king (royalists) and persons loyal to Polish magnates (confederates).

==Provinces==
After the Union of Lublin (1569) Crown lands were divided into two provinces: Lesser Poland (Polish: Małopolska) and Greater Poland (Polish: Wielkopolska). These were further divided into administrative units known as voivodeships (the Polish names of the voivodships and towns are shown below in parentheses).

===Greater Poland Province===

* Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship (, Brześć Kujawski)
* Gniezno Voivodeship (, Gniezno) from 1768
* Inowrocław Voivodeship (, Inowrocław)
* Kalisz Voivodeship (, Kalisz)
* Łęczyca Voivodeship (, Łęczyca)
* Mazovian Voivodeship (, of Mazowsze, Warsaw)
* Poznań Voivodeship (, Poznań)
* Płock Voivodeship (, Płock)
* Podlaskie Voivodeship (, Drohiczyn)
* Rawa Voivodeship (, Rawa)
* Sieradz Voivodeship (, Sieradz)
* Prince-Bishopric of Warmia

===Lesser Poland Province===

* Bełz Voivodeship (, Bełz)
* Bracław Voivodeship (, Bracław)
* Czernihów Voivodeship (, Czernihów)
* Kijów Voivodeship (, Kijów)
* Kraków Voivodeship (, Kraków)
* Lublin Voivodeship (, Lublin)
* Podole Voivodeship (, Kamieniec Podolski)
* Ruś Voivodeship (, Lwów)
* Sandomierz Voivodeship (, Sandomierz)
* Wołyń Voivodeship (, Łuck)
* Duchy of Siewierz (Siewierz)

===Royal Prussia Province (1569–1772)===

&quot;Royal Prussia&quot; () was a semi-autonomous province of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1569 to 1772. Royal Prussia included Pomerelia, Chełmno Land (Kulmerland), Malbork Voivodeship (Marienburg), Gdańsk (Danzig), Toruń (Thorn), and Elbląg (Elbing). Polish historian Henryk Wisner writes that Royal Prussia belonged to the Province of Greater Poland.

==Other holdings or fiefs==
===Principality of Moldavia (1387–1497)===

The history of Moldavia has long been intertwined with that of Poland. The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz mentioned Moldavians (under the name &quot;Wallachians&quot;) as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King Władysław I, against the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the Hungarian Kingdom which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldavia into its political orbit.

Ties between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the Polish annexation of Galicia in the aftermath of the Galicia–Volhynia Wars and the founding of the Moldavian state by Bogdan of Cuhea. Bogdan, a Vlach voivode from Maramureș who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathian Mountains in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in transforming it into an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of Angevin Poland and Hungary (the latter was still the country&#x27;s overlord), Bogdan&#x27;s successor Lațcu, the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the Poles. Lațcu also accepted conversion to Roman Catholicism around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without lasting consequences.

Petru I profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the Jagiellon realm, becoming a vassal of Władysław II on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the Teutonic Knights, and was granted control over Pokuttya until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the Battle of Obertyn (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the Danube Delta. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled Cetatea Albă in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the Black Sea, before being toppled from the throne for supporting Fyodor Koriatovych in his conflict with Vytautas the Great of Lithuania. Under Stephen I, growing Polish influence was challenged by Sigismund of Hungary, whose expedition was defeated at Ghindăoani in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

Although Alexander I was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from Mircea I of Wallachia), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the Battle of Grunwald and the Siege of Marienburg), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia&#x27;s history, but also saw the first confrontation with the Ottoman Turks at Cetatea Albă in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru&#x27;s long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of Bogdan II and the ascension of Peter III Aaron in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as Matthias Corvinus deposed Aron and backed Alexăndrel to the throne in Suceava. Petru Aron&#x27;s rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia&#x27;s Ottoman Empire allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay tribute to Sultan Mehmed II.

The principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of Pokuttya, the fiefdoms of Cetatea de Baltă and Ciceu (both in Transylvania) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.

===Towns in Spisz (Szepes) County (1412–1795)===
As one of the terms of the Treaty of Lubowla, the Hungarian crown exchanged, for a loan of &quot;sixty times the amount of 37,000 Prague groschen&quot; (approximately seven tonnes of pure silver), 16 rich salt-producing towns in the area of Spisz (Zips), as well as a right to incorporate them into Poland until the debt was repaid. The towns affected were: Biała, Lubica, Wierzbów, Spiska Sobota, Poprad, Straże, Spiskie Włochy, Nowa Wieś, Spiska Nowa Wieś, Ruszkinowce, Wielka, Spiskie Podgrodzie, Maciejowce, Twarożne.

=== Duchy of Siewierz (1443–1795) ===

Wenceslaus I sold the Duchy of Siewierz to the Archbishop of Kraków, Zbigniew Cardinal Oleśnicki, for 6,000 silver groats in 1443. After that point it was considered to be associated with the Lesser Poland Province and was the only ecclesiastical duchy in Lesser Poland. The junction of the duchy with the Lesser Poland Province was concluded in 1790 when the Great Sejm formally incorporated the Duchy, as part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

=== Prince-Bishopric of Warmia (1466–1772) ===

The Prince-Bishopric of Warmia (,) was a semi independent ecclesiastical state, ruled by the incumbent ordinary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia, and a protectorate of Kingdom of Poland, later part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Peace of Thorn (1466–1772)

=== Lauenburg and Bütow Land ===

After the childless death of the last of the House of Pomerania, Bogislaw XIV in 1637, Lauenburg and Bütow Land again became a &quot;terra&quot; (land, &quot;ziemia&quot;) of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1641 it became part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the 1657 Treaty of Bydgoszcz, which amended the Treaty of Wehlau, it was granted to the Hohenzollern dynasty of Brandenburg-Prussia in return for her help against Sweden in the Swedish-Polish War under the same favorable conditions the House of Pomerania had enjoyed before. Lauenburg and Bütow Land was officially a Polish fiefdom until the First Partition of Poland in 1772 when King Frederick II of Prussia incorporated the territory into Prussia and the subsequent Treaty of Warsaw in 1773 made the former conditions obsolete.

===Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (Courland) (1562–1791)===

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia is a duchy in the Baltic region that existed from 1562 to 1791 as a vassal state of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1791 it gained full independence, but on March 28, 1795, it was annexed by the Russian Empire in the Third Partition of Poland. The duchy also had colonies in Tobago and Gambia.

===Duchy of Prussia (1569–1657)===

The &quot;Duchy of Prussia&quot; was a duchy in the eastern part of Prussia from 1525 to 1701. In 1525 during the Protestant Reformation, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Hohenzollern, secularized the Prussian State of the Teutonic Order, becoming Albert, Duke in Prussia. His duchy, which had its capital in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), was established as a fief of the Crown of Poland, as had been Teutonic Prussia since the Second Peace of Thorn in October 1466. This treaty had ended the War of the Cities or Thirteen Years&#x27; War and provided for the Order&#x27;s cession of its rights over the western half of its territories to the Polish crown, which became the province of Royal Prussia, while the remaining part of the Order&#x27;s land became a fief of the Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569). In the 17th century King John II Casimir of Poland submitted Frederick William to regain Prussian suzerainty in return for supporting Poland against Sweden. On July 29, 1657, they signed the Treaty of Wehlau in Wehlau (Polish: Welawa; now Znamensk), whereby Frederick William renounced a previous Swedish-Prussian alliance and John Casimir recognised Frederick William&#x27;s full sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia. Full sovereignty was a necessary prerequisite for upgrading the Duchy to Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.

===Duchy of Livonia (Inflanty) (1569–1772)===

The &quot;Duchy of Livonia&quot; was a territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania – and later a joint domain (Condominium) of the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

==Protectorates==
===Caffa===

In 1462, during the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars, Caffa placed itself under the protection of King Casimir IV of Poland. The proposition of protection was accepted by the Polish king but when the real danger came, help for Caffa never arrived.

<text>The National Library of Sweden (, &quot;KB&quot;, meaning &quot;the Royal Library&quot;) is Sweden&#x27;s national library. It collects and preserves all domestic printed and audio-visual materials in Swedish, as well as content with Swedish association published abroad. Being a research library, it also has major collections of literature in other languages.

==Collections==

The collections of the National Library consist of more than 18 million objects, including books, posters, pictures, manuscripts, and newspapers. The audio-visual collection consists of more than 10 million hours of recorded material.

The National Library is also a humanities research library, with collections of foreign literature in a wide range of subjects. The library holds a collection of 850 broadsides of Sweden dating from 1852.

The National Library also purchases literature about Sweden written in foreign languages and works by Swedes published abroad, a category known as suecana. The National Library has been collecting floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and other electronic storage media since the mid-1990s, along with e-books, e-journals, websites, and other digital material.

In 1953, the National Library purchased considerable amounts of Russian literature from Leningrad and Moscow. These books were to form the basis of a Slavonic library in Stockholm. These plans were consolidated in an agreement made in 1964 between the Lenin Library in Moscow and the National Library in which the respective libraries agreed to exchange their countries&#x27; literature.

== Legal deposit ==
According to the Swedish Legal Deposit Act publishers of printed material must send one copy of every object to the National Library and six other research libraries. Publishers of music, film, radio and TV must similarly submit copies to the library. In some cases only a sample of broadcast material has to be submitted.

In 2012, the Legal Deposit Act for Electronic Material was passed. It states that starting in 2013, publishing companies and public authorities must deliver digitally published content to the National Library.

=== History ===

The obligation to collect all printed works in Swedish was laid down in 1661 in an ordinance from the Swedish Privy Council Chancery. The ordinance (legal deposit) ordered all printers in Sweden to send two copies of every publication printed to the Chancery before the material was distributed. One copy was to go to the Swedish National Archives (Riksarkivet), the other to the National Library. The motive for this provision stemmed not from a desire to preserve publications for posterity but from a desire to monitor their contents.

== Library cooperation ==
The library is responsible for coordinating all Swedish libraries, including public libraries.

The National Library is responsible for supplying information to higher education and research, which includes obtaining central license agreements for research and university libraries to increase access to various databases. The National Library developed and maintains LIBRIS, the national library database system. LIBRIS is freely available to the public via the Internet and contains more than five million titles held in 300 Swedish libraries. The Swedish ISBN Agency is a unit within the National Library. It is responsible for assigning ISBNs having Sweden&#x27;s country prefix of 91- (and 978-91-).

The library is a partner of the World Digital Library.

==History==
The roots of what we now know as the National Library go back to the days of King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century. The king collected books on a variety of subjects including history, science, and theology, as well as maps. The collections were expanded by Eric XIV, Johan III, and Charles IX and kept in the palace known as Tre Kronor (The Three Crowns). Some books were purchased abroad, while others were confiscated from Swedish monasteries dissolved in the Protestant Reformation. King Gustavus Adolphus gave away parts of the royal book collection in 1620: those books were the foundation of the Uppsala University Library.

The collection was also expanded through booty taken during the Thirty Years’ War. These captured treasures included the episcopal library of Würzburg in 1631, the University of Olomouc library in 1642, and the royal library of Prague in 1649. It was in this connection that the 13th-century “Devil&#x27;s Bible” (the Codex Gigas) came to Stockholm. Queen Christina took much of this material with her to Rome after she abdicated the Swedish throne, but the royal collections continued to grow during the reign of Charles X Gustav through additional spoils of war and purchases abroad. The manuscript collection also includes the Anglo-Saxon Stockholm Codex Aureus.

Under the Chancery Decree of 1661, all book printers in Sweden were required by law to submit two copies of everything they printed – one copy for the National Archives and the other for the National Library. Rather than to acquire newly published literature for research purposes, the decree reflected the desire of a great power to exert state control and censorship.

Much of the library went up in flames during the Tre Kronor Palace fire of 1697 when 17,286 bound volumes and 1,103 manuscripts were lost. Only 6,700 volumes and 283 manuscripts survived. Thereafter, the books were stored temporarily in various noble palaces in Stockholm, first in Count Lillie&#x27;s house on what was then Norrmalm Square (1697–1702), and later in the Bonde Palace (1702–1730), and Count Per Brahe&#x27;s house on Helgeandsholmen (1730–1768). Finally, in 1768, the collections could be moved into the northeast wing of the new royal palace.

The collection grew further in its new home when the Antiquities Archive was dissolved in 1780 and most of the books kept there were transferred to the National Library. In 1792, Gustav III donated his private library of 14,500 works and four years later, Gustav IV Adolf donated 7,500 works. As a result, the National Library owned about 40,000 works by 1814.

Several large book collections, either donated or purchased, came to the National Library in the 19th century. Space was limited in the palace and a new home for the collections was required. In 1877, the National Library moved into new, dedicated premises in Humlegården. The library began installing electric lighting in 1887, but the library was not fully electrified until 1964.

=== Book thefts ===
In 2004, it was discovered that dozens of rare books from its collection had been stolen. The subsequent investigation revealed that the thief was Anders Burius, a senior librarian working at the National Library. At least 62 books were stolen and then auctioned off at a German auction house. The police investigation was closed in 2006 and reopened in 2014 upon appeal. The investigation closed after a year and a half with no books repatriated.

In 2011, the first book was returned to the library-an atlas by Cornelius Wytfliet. It had been bought by a map dealer in New York from a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in 2003. Its value was estimated at $450,000. In 2015, some books were repatriated to Sweden by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office. In 2021, ten books were returned. As of 2021, 17 out of 62 stolen books have been returned. The library maintains a list of the missing books.

==The building==
At first, the royal book collections were kept in the Royal Palace (Tre Kronor), which burned down in 1697. The National Library moved into its current building in Humlegården in December/January 1877/1878. The building was designed by Gustaf Dahl and built using cast iron. Two wings were added in 1926–27.

The National Library was reopened in spring 1997 after comprehensive remodeling and additions. Two large underground stacks, which were built into the bedrock below the building, now contain the bulk of the library&#x27;s collections, while library patrons, other visitors, and employees share the space in the main building.

The new section, called the Annex, contains auditoriums, exhibition rooms, and a newspaper reading room. Many Swedish daily newspapers and a large number of foreign newspapers are available on microfilm and in a digital search tool in the Microfilm Reading Room.

==Organization==
The National Library is a state agency that reports to the Ministry of Education and Research. Gunilla Herdenberg has been the National Librarian of Sweden since March 2012.

==Audiovisual media==
Until 2009, the Swedish National Archive of Recorded Sound and Moving Images collected and archived audiovisual material. In 2009, the archive became a part of the National Library and ceased to be an independent institution.

==Digital collections==
Beginning 24 March 1997, the National Library also archived the Swedish part of the World Wide Web as part of a project called &quot;kulturarw3&quot; (a play on words; &quot;kulturarv&quot; is Swedish for cultural heritage). Initially, the contents were not available to the public due to copyright issues, but after 2004 visitors to the library could access the archive from dedicated read-only computers on library premises.

In 2010, mass digitization of Swedish newspapers began, and as of 2016, over 12 million pages had been processed.

In 2020, the library, along with the university libraries in Lund, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Uppsala, and Umeå, launched a project to digitize physical materials printed in Sweden.

<doc id="393173" wikidata="Q371493" url="?curid=393173" title="Brook Benton">
<text>Benjamin Franklin Peay (September 19, 1931 – April 9, 1988), known professionally as Brook Benton, was an American singer and songwriter whose music transcended rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and pop music genres in the 1950s and 1960s, with hits such as &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; and &quot;Endlessly&quot;.

His last hit was the 1970 ballad &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot;. Benton scored more than 50 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart hits as a singer/songwriter and with hits he wrote for other performers.

==Early life and career==
Benton began singing gospel music in a Methodist church choir in Lugoff, South Carolina, where his father was choir master.

In 1948, Benton went to New York where he joined The Langfordaires and The Jerusalem Stars before joining The Sandmen. Epic Records signed The Sandmen in 1954, immediately sending the group to record at the Columbia studios in New York. Columbia placed The Sandmen on its Okeh Records. Upon a second recording session, Okeh decided to push Benton as a solo artist. Benton recorded his first solo, &quot;The Kentuckian Song&quot;, the theme from a movie of the same name.

Benton switched to RCA&#x27;s Vik subsidiary in 1957, where he had a single chart appearance, 1958&#x27;s &quot;A Million Miles From Nowhere&quot;, which peaked at No. 82 on U.S. charts. He wrote two songs that charted for other performers, Clyde McPhatter&#x27;s &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Question&quot; and Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Looking Back&quot;.

In 1958, Benton signed with Mercury Records, where he recorded hits &quot;It&#x27;s Just A Matter Of Time&quot;, &quot;Endlessly&quot;, &quot;Thank You Pretty Baby&quot;, &quot;So Many Ways&quot;, &quot;Baby (You&#x27;ve Got What It Takes)&quot;, &quot;A Rockin&#x27; Good Way&quot; (both duets with Dinah Washington), &quot;Kiddio&quot;, &quot;The Boll Weevil Song&quot;, and &quot;Hotel Happiness&quot;. 

One of Benton&#x27;s sisters was the original artist to record &quot;Baby (You&#x27;ve Got What It Takes)&quot;, in 1958, under the title &quot;You&#x27;ve Got What It Takes&quot;, using the stage name Dorothy Pay, as the B-side of her single &quot;Strollin&#x27; with My Baby&quot;. In August 1959 Benton partnered with Dinah Washington to record the song and their version, released in January 1960, was hugely successful on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, reaching #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #1 on the Hot R&amp;B sides chart for 10 weeks, becoming one of the most successful R&amp;B singles of the 1960s.

==Success==
In 1959, he finally made his breakthrough with hits like &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; and &quot;Endlessly&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. &quot;Endlessly&quot; made it to No. 12. Both of the first two hits were written by Benton with Clyde Otis. They were originally offered to Nat King Cole, but when Otis became an A&amp;R manager and producer at Mercury, he convinced Benton to sign with the label and record them himself, while asking Cole not to record the songs as planned. Benton followed this success with a series of hits, including &quot;So Many Ways&quot; (No. 6), &quot;Hotel Happiness&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Think Twice&quot; (No. 11), &quot;Kiddio&quot; (No. 7), and &quot;The Boll Weevil Song&quot; (No. 2). In 1960, he had two top 10 hit duets with Dinah Washington: &quot;Baby (You&#x27;ve Got What It Takes)&quot; (No. 5) and &quot;A Rockin&#x27; Good Way (to Mess Around and Fall in Love)&quot; (No. 7).

In the mid 1960s, Benton recorded for RCA Records and Reprise Records with minimal commercial success. Then, in 1968, he signed with Cotillion Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, where, the following year, he enjoyed his last major hit with &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot;, written by Tony Joe White and produced and arranged by Arif Mardin, a million-seller which topped the Billboard R&amp;B chart. Cornell Dupree played guitar on the song. Benton recorded a total of five albums with Mardin, including a gospel album, during his stay at Cotillion.

Benton eventually charted a total of 49 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with other songs charting on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s rhythm and blues, easy listening, and Christmas music charts. The last album made by Benton was &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;, which was released posthumously in 2005. He also had records released on various other labels, including All-Platinum, Brut, Olde Worlde, Stax and Groove Records.

==Death==
Weakened from spinal meningitis, Benton died of pneumonia in Queens, New York City, at the age of 56 on April 9, 1988. He was survived by his wife, Mary Benton, and six children: Brook Jr., Vanessa, Roy, Is&#x27;real, Gerald, and Benjamin.

<doc id="393174" wikidata="Q937773" url="?curid=393174" title="Rive Gauche">
<text>&quot;Rive Gauche(;Left Bank&quot;&#x27;) is the southern bank of the river Seine in Paris. Here the river flows roughly westward, cutting the city in two parts. When facing downstream, the southern bank is to the left, whereas the northern bank (or Rive Droite) is to the right.

The Rive Gauche is associated with artists, writers and philosophers, including Colette, Margaret Anderson, Djuna Barnes, Natalie Barney, Sylvia Beach, Erik Satie, Kay Boyle, Bryher, Caresse Crosby, Nancy Cunard, H.D., Janet Flanner, Jane Heap, Maria Jolas, Mina Loy, Henry Miller, Adrienne Monnier, Anaïs Nin, Jean Rhys, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Renee Vivien, Edith Wharton Pablo Picasso, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine, Henri Matisse, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Baldwin, and dozens of members of the great artistic community at Montparnasse.

The phrase implies a sense of bohemianism, counterculture and creativity. Some of its famous streets are the Boulevard Saint-Germain, Boulevard Saint-Michel, the Rue de Vaugirard, Rue Bonaparte, and others.

The Latin Quarter is situated on the Rive Gauche, within the 5th and 6th arrondissements in the vicinity of the University of Paris. In the 12th century, the philosopher Pierre Abélard helped create the neighborhood when, due to his controversial teaching, he was pressured into relocating from the prestigious Île de la Cité to a less conspicuous residence. As he and his followers populated the Left Bank, it became famous for the prevalence of scholarly Latin spoken there. The area&#x27;s origin story formed the basis of the saying, &quot;Paris &#x27;learned to think&#x27; on the Left Bank&quot;.

<text>Alford is a market town and civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England, at the foot of the Lincolnshire Wolds, which form an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The population was recorded as 3,459 in the 2011 Census and estimated at 3,830 in 2021. It lies between the towns of Mablethorpe, Louth, Spilsby, and Skegness and acts as a local retail centre.

== History ==
Alford is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Alforde. There was a settlement at Alford in pre-Norman times and it provided a place to cross the beck. This is intimated in the &#x27;ford&#x27; part of its name.

The town occupied an important position historically and a charter was obtained by William Well, lord of the manor of Alford, in 1283 for a market to be held on Tuesdays and two annual fairs – one at Whitsun and the other in November. These remained active until 1939 with the bull fair continuing until 1972. A cattle market was established in 1911 but closed in 1987.

In 1810 a purpose built theatre was being used by Joseph Smedley at a cost of seven Guineas.

The railway was opened in 1848 but was closed in 1970 with the demolition of the Grimsby to Boston line.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. This stretches east to the coast, with a population of 4,531 recorded in the 2011 census.

==Amenities==
Alford&#x27;s retail outlets cater mainly for local demand. Shops include a pharmacy, a grocery, two butchers (the later one opened in November 2016) and DIY and hardware stores. There are three supermarkets, in Church Street, West Street and Hamilton Road. The five public houses are the &quot;Half Moon Hotel&quot;, &quot;Windmill Hotel&quot;, &quot;George&quot;, &quot;Anchor&quot; and &quot;White Hart&quot;. Four of these still operate as such – the &quot;Half Moon&quot; has a tea shop attached and is a venue for local activities. &quot;The Anchor&quot; has been renovated as a bed-and-breakfast establishment. &quot;The Windmill&quot; is now a hotel, while the &quot;White Hart&quot; is still a traditional pub.

The town has no banks, as the last, Lloyds Bank, closed in September 2018. There is still a Yorkshire Building Society office. Banking facilities are available at the Post Office, which operates in the Quicky Supermarket in West Street.

H &amp; M Ducos Pottery, established in London in 1972, moved to Alford in 1973 and became the Alford Pottery. It acquired premises in Commercial Road in 1978 to manufacture tableware that is exported worldwide. The firm set up the Alford Craft Market, the Alford Festivals of arts and crafts, the Alford Folk Club (now an acoustic club), the Alford Morris Dancing club, the former Alford Jazz Festival, the former Alford Film Society, and other organisations. Alford Craft Market Centre is a cooperative venture selling works from local and regional craftsmen. With help from a substantial National Lottery grant, it provides various classes and workshops to allow the public to experience art and craft activities on a regular basis.

There are National Health private dentists in South Street and a doctor&#x27;s surgery in West Street. A crematorium opened at the entrance to the town in 2008.

The charter market day is Tuesday. The main market is run by the town council in the marketplace, with stalls for groceries, greengroceries, fishmongers and other items, and an auction. The Alford Craft Market has been held in the Market Place every late Spring and August bank holiday since 1975, in the grounds of Alford Manor House. The summer weekly Craft Market now takes place in the Corn Exchange and the Christmas Extravaganza at the Manor House on the first Friday in December. The cattle market closed in 1987 and the site became the Co-op Car Park. In February 2019, the Alford Promotions group was set up by shop-owners and councillors to organize community events, including a Christmas Market, the first of which was held on 30 November 2019.

==Schools==
Alford has three schools: one primary school and two secondary schools. They are located on different sides of Alford.

==Employment and transport==
Most factories have closed in the last few years. The main sources of employment are newer businesses on the Safelincs industrial estate in West Street and the schools, nursing homes and smaller firms.
Beeching&#x27;s Way Industrial Estate in the south-west of the town includes printing and manufacturing firms, a builders&#x27; merchant and a postal sorting office. It was built on the disused lines of the East Lincolnshire Railway from Grimsby to Boston, which closed on 5 October 1970, along with the local station. The naming of the industrial estate as Beeching&#x27;s Way is a reminder of Richard Beeching, who masterminded the nationwide rail cutbacks under publicly owned British Railways at the behest of the Department of Transport.

There is a daytime Monday-to-Friday bus service to Skegness, a single Wednesday service to Boston, and occasional local and school bus services open to other passengers.

 Alford also has bus connections to Mablethorpe and Spilsby, and one service a day to and from Louth. The nearest railway station is in Thorpe Culvert.

== Demography ==

The population was recorded as 3,459 in the 2011 Census and estimated at 3,789 in 2019. Alford electoral ward recorded a population of 4,531 on the 2011 census.

==Landmarks==
===Windmill===
Alford is known for its Grade I listed five-sailed windmill, a tower mill built in 1837 by Sam Oxley, an Alford millwright. In its heyday, it ground 4-5 tons of corn a day. It ceased to operate in 1955, but after two years&#x27; idle, it was restored to full working order in 1957 and is used commercially to produce stone-ground organic flour and cereal, as the only surviving windmill in the town of the three in 1932, each with a different number of sails (four, five and six). Other working windmills in the county remain at Lincoln, Heckington, Boston, Waltham, Kirton in Lindsey, Sibsey, Moulton, and Burgh le Marsh.

===Manor House===

Alford Manor House is one of the country&#x27;s largest thatched buildings of its kind. In 2006, it was refurbished with National Lottery funding through English Heritage. Interactive exhibits were installed and accessibility increased for disabled visitors. It has a tearoom and open gardens.

The Manor House has two permanent exhibitions. &quot;Alford Remembers&quot; has First World War memorabilia and a photography exhibition by Edwin Nainby, who was born in Gedney in January 1842 and died in Alford in July 1908. The youngest son of a Quaker, he was first in business as a photographer in Long Sutton and moved to Alford in 1873. There are over 750 glass photography plates exhibited. The annual events at the Manor House include a Christmas Tree exhibition, a tractor rally and a threshing day. There is a local museum at the back of the Manor House (Hackett&#x27;s Barn), displaying the time when Alford thrived as a Victorian market town.

===Corn Exchange===
The Corn Exchange was given by East Lindsey District Council to a specially instituted body composed solely of volunteers, as a centre for cultural, social and community activities.

==Education==
Alford has a primary school, one of England&#x27;s few remaining grammar schools, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, founded in 1566, and John Spendluffe Technology College. The grammar school received a mixed Ofsted day-inspection report in 2007 and a &quot;Good&quot; school inspection in 2021. The technology college was gauged as &quot;requiring improvement&quot; at a full Ofsted inspection in March 2019 but received a &quot;Good&quot; school inspection in 2023.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire and Hits Radio Lincolnshire.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;LincolnshireWorld&quot; (formerly &quot;Alford Standard&quot;).

==Religious sites==

The Anglican Parish Church of Alford is dedicated to St Wilfrid, a 7th-century English bishop. Built in the 14th century, then restored with additions from 1860, it stands at the junction of Church, South and West streets. It includes St Lawrence&#x27;s Chapel. The original features include a 14th-century screen, a Jacobean pulpit, traces of 16th-century glass and a 17th-century tomb in the chancel. The church founded a school in the Elizabethan period. Regular services and some annual community events such as a flower show are held. The war memorial in the churchyard commemorates local victims of the two world wars and in Northern Ireland.

Alford has a Methodist church, an Independent Congregational church, and Alford Christian Fellowship.

<doc id="393186" wikidata="Q1940839" url="?curid=393186" title="Amble">
<text>Amble is a town on the North Sea coast of Northumberland, England, at the mouth of the River Coquet; Coquet Island is visible from its beaches and harbour. In 2021, the parish of Amble by the Sea had a population of 5,860.

== Etymology ==
There are two suggested origins of the place-name Amble. One theory suggests a Goidelic origin from &quot;Am Béal&quot;, meaning &quot;tidal inlet&quot;, and is attributed to the historical presence of Irish missionaries in the area who spoke that language despite most of the local population not doing so. An earlier theory, originating with Eilert Ekwall, is an Old English origin of &quot;Amma/Anna bile&quot;, meaning &quot;Amma&#x27;s/Anna&#x27;s headland&quot;.

There are sources indicating that the name and variants thereof – such as &quot;Ambell&quot; and &quot;Ambhill&quot; – may have been in use as long ago as 1203 AD. Northumberland was not recorded in the Domesday Book.

== History ==
Various urns, cists, flint spearheads and other evidence of ancient burials were found near to Amble in the 1880s and 1890s. Some of those remains showed signs of cremation.

Outcrops of coal had been found along the coastline between the River Coquet and the River Tyne at least as long ago as the reign of Elizabeth I, when unsuccessful attempts had been made to extract and transport it in an economic manner. A failed proposal to use Amble as a port for the shipment of locally sourced coal and salt is recorded in 1618, although this failure did not discourage William Hewitt from making the then rare decision to reserve for himself the rights to the coal when he sold the townships of Amble and Hauxley in 1630. A significant factor in the failure of all the early attempts, when compared to the success of ventures in the valleys of the Tyne and the Wear, was that of economies of scale. Those more successful areas at that time had plentiful easily accessed reserves which encouraged investment and the sharing of fixed costs such as harbour facilities, buildings and machinery among a large number of enterprises.

The early situation changed as the operators in the valleys exhausted the cheaply extracted ores and found themselves having to mine deeper and also further away from the rivers that were used for transport, thus increasing their costs per unit of coal mined. Some coal was probably being shipped from previously uneconomic places such Amble and Blyth by the end of the seventeenth century, and it was certainly being extracted at Amble by that time.

Amble grew in the nineteenth century as collieries were opened; and the newly built railway links to the Northumberland coalfields made the town a centre for the sea transport and export of coal. Prior to the development of the harbour, the town was &quot;little more than a hamlet&quot;, according to the architectural guides originally compiled by Nikolaus Pevsner. The principal local mineworkings were those at Broomhill and at Radcliffe.

The harbour at Amble was the smallest of those that served the coalfields of Northumberland and Durham. It was originally under the control of the Dukes of Northumberland until, in 1837, a port authority – the Warkworth Harbour Commission – was created to supervise improvements. Following consultations with various engineers, the proposals submitted by John Rennie in 1838 were accepted. These included the construction of breakwaters to the north and the south, which were eventually completed in 1849 at a total cost of £116,000. The larger northern breakwater, which was originally in length, was extended in the early part of the 20th century but suffered from the undermining effects of the tide and required shoring with slag brought in from the ironworks of Hartlepool and Middlesbrough.

The construction of docks had also been mooted in 1844 and 1850 but the arrival of the railway led instead to the construction of coal staithes. A change in consulting engineer in 1869 resulted in extensive dredging of the harbour but did not greatly improve the prospects of the port. Shipments of coal amounted to over 500,000 tons by 1914, but this was a modest volume when compared to the other regional ports. Robert Rennison notes with regard to the relative lack of prosperity that the port served a &quot;small and discrete coalfield&quot;.

The railway branched on a single track to Amble at a point near to Chevington and was opened in September 1849 by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, initially as a freight-only line. Passenger services between Amble and Chevington began in 1879, following the construction of a station at Broomhill in 1878 and facilities at Amble itself. The line between Amble and Broomhill was double-track. The passenger service ended in July 1930 and the general freight service was withdrawn in 1964. Coal traffic, which had amounted to around 750,000 tons annually in the 1920s, came to an end in 1969 when the line was closed completely.

Other industries, such as sea fishing and both ship building and repair in an area known as the Braid had expanded with the growth of the town. Traditional Northumbrian fishing vessels such as cobles had previously sheltered in the natural harbour for centuries. One local coble manufacturing business, J. &amp; J. Harrison, founded in 1870, had been the first to introduce engines to the form and was still producing it in 1973, along with more generally utilised craft.

Amble Golf Club was founded in 1910 but disappeared in the late 1950s.

On 1 December 1943, a Royal Air Force Short Stirling Mk III (EH880) which departed RAF Mepal, Cambridgeshire, had completed its mission of dropping sea mines off the coast of Denmark. The aircraft was due to land at RAF Acklington. The pilots attempted a second approach to Acklington in bad weather; the aircraft crashed into Cliff House Farm, Togston. Six of the seven crew died along with five children on the ground: a 1997 housing development in the western edge of the town has streets named after the children who perished.

==Present day==

Sir Nikolaus Pevsner&#x27;s guide of 1992 says that &quot;Today Amble is a not unpleasant small town but has few buildings of distinction.&quot; Of those, he records the church of St Cuthbert, which was originally constructed in 1870 and expanded in 1929, and its associated 1876-built vicarage. In addition, he notes some early Victorian terraces on Queen Street and North Street, as well as &quot;a fragment of wall with a C 15 window, square-headed and of two trefoiled lights with uncusped sunk panels above. Though it may seem unlikely, this is an &quot;in situ&quot; fragment of the medieval manor house. It belonged to Tynemouth Priory and may have served as a monastic cell.&quot; This latter is found on High Street.

The fishing industry continues in Amble today, albeit with a reduced number of vessels, as does a small marine industry which is mainly concentrated around the construction and repair of yachts and other pleasure craft. A small industrial estate is located to the southwest of the town, whose clients include vehicle repairs and telecommunications companies. However, , most of the units on the estate are unoccupied and the town has been affected by the closure of nearby businesses, such as a site operated by Alcan, as well as two food processing businesses in the town that employed nearly 300 people. A proposed retail development by Tesco had also been postponed due to poor trading conditions. The town&#x27;s mayor announced that &quot;the prospects for jobs are very bleak indeed.&quot;

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution maintains a station at Amble. Amble RNLI station has two lifeboats – the Shannon Class &#x27;Shannon Elizabeth and Leonard&#x27;, which replaced the Mersey Class lifeboat &#x27;The Four Boys&#x27; in November 2016 after the station raised £200,000 towards the new vessel&#x27;s £2,000,000 cost. Amble&#x27;s second lifeboat is the &#x27;D Class&#x27; Inshore Lifeboat (or ILB), the &#x27;Mildred Holcroft&#x27;. There have been lifeboats operating from the town since 1842 and, for example, between 30 and 40 people perished in various wrecks near to Amble on 17–18 December 1872.

===Regeneration and community development===
Amble had been a recipient of regional development assistance from 1965, when the restructuring of coal-mining operations, led by Alfred Robens of the National Coal Board, had a substantial detrimental effect on the local economy. Unemployment in the town was then 6.5 per cent, compared to a national average of 1.5 per cent. By 1969, the Northern Economic Planning Council was proposing the closure of the port, which no longer had any coal traffic, in favour of redevelopment for leisure purposes. The same year saw the closure of the nearby airbase of RAF Acklington, where some of the population worked, and local unemployment exceeded 13 per cent as proposals for a substantial mushroom farming operation that would alleviate the problems were made. The farming operation failed to materialise due to lack of financial support from the government.

The development assistance was withdrawn in 1984, at which time a newspaper report noted that over 30 per cent of the 6,000 population were unemployed, with 80 per cent of council house tenants and 45 per cent of home owners receiving benefits or rebates for their housing costs and over 25 per cent of children claiming free school meals. The change in official status was one of the &quot;glaring anomalies&quot; of a government review, resulting from the town being reclassified as part of the &quot;travel to work area&quot; for Alnwick rather than a part of the industrialised regions to the south. Four businesses had been encouraged by the assistance to locate in the town during the preceding decade, creating around 400 jobs.

Amble Development Trust is a company operating as a charity with the purpose of working with other bodies to regenerate the town. It was established in 1994. The Trust has been involved in numerous local projects to develop Amble both physically and socially, including having input on improvements to Queen Street, which is the main shopping thoroughfare. The work of the Trust and its associated body, the Amble Strategic Partnership, was recognised by the Royal Town Planning Institute in 2003 when they were given the institute&#x27;s Planning for Town Regeneration award. This came soon after the same organisation had awarded them their Regional Award for Planning Achievement.
Recently new housing has been built, adding an extra 900 homes, and a new hotel called the Amble Inn opened in 2019 bringing much-needed employment to the town.
Another project of the Trust is The Ambler, a bi-monthly community newspaper and website, established in 2000 and operated mainly by volunteers. The free bi-monthly newspaper is delivered to every house and business in the town.

== Demography ==
Samuel Lewis reported a township population of 247 in 1831. By the seventh edition of his &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;, which was published in 1848, this figure had risen to 724. The population was reported as being 1,040 in 1851. The 1871 census recorded a population of 1,233, spread among 233 houses.

D. J. Rowe notes that, in common with many Northumbrian towns, historically there was &quot;endemic&quot; overcrowding of the population in Amble. The number of houses that averaged over two people per room was 32.6 per cent in 1911. This figure, while not atypical for the region, was above average for the county and well above that for other regions of the country, such as London.

==Governance==
During the medieval period, Amble was a part of the liberty held by successive priors of Tynemouth, most of whom faced challenges to their authority from both the Crown and their major tenants. The town was ceded to the Crown in 1539, at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Until measures such as the Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867, the electoral franchise was very restricted. In the 1826 General Election, there were nine people eligible to vote due to their freehold interests in Amble, of which six actually lived there; another voter lived in Amble but was enfranchised due to freehold interests held elsewhere. Twelve voters living in Amble qualified as freeholders or through land occupancy in the 1841 election, whilst another lived there but qualified due to property held elsewhere, and one lived elsewhere but held qualifying property in the township.

The Amble Local Government District, given the job of looking after the town, was set up around September 1878, the ecclesiastical parish comprising Amble, Hauxley, Gloster Hill and Togston having been formed by splitting from that of Warkworth in 1869 just before completion of the church construction. Elections to the nine-member committee followed and it first met on 25 November 1878. George W. Beattie was appointed Surveyor and Inspector of Nuisances to the Amble Local Board and Urban Sanitary Authority in January 1879. The administration was replaced by Amble Urban District Council which first met on 3 January 1895. Amble Urban District Council had nine elected Councillors. On 1 April 1974 the urban district was abolished and Amble became part of Alnwick district.

On 29 November 1976 the civil parish was renamed from &quot;Amble&quot; to &quot;Amble by the Sea&quot;.

On 1 April 2009, the local government structure of Northumberland was reorganised. The six former districts were combined with the county to form the unitary authority of Northumberland, based in Morpeth. Amble was in the former Alnwick District based in the town of Alnwick.

An electoral ward of the same name now exists. This ward includes Hauxley with a total population at the 2011 Census of 4,565. However, some outlying parts of the town are excluded from this Amble ward and are instead combined with Warkworth in a ward named Amble West with Warkworth.

==Climate==

Being in the British Isles, Amble experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station for which data are available is at Boulmer, about nine miles to the north.

==Transport==

===Road===
Amble is situated on the A1068 that runs along the north-eastern coastline. This road is the old corn trading road which runs from Hexham in south west Northumberland through Cramlington, Bedlington, Guide Post, Ashington and Ellington. The road continues through more open coastal areas towards Amble and continues approximately to the north to Alnmouth, then winds on to Alnwick.

Amble also lies near to the A1, providing easy access to nearest city Newcastle upon Tyne ( south), Gateshead ( south) and to the Scottish capital Edinburgh ( north).

===Rail===
The East Coast Main Line railway between Edinburgh (journey time approximately 1:10) and London (journey time approximately 3:45) runs via the nearby Alnmouth for Alnwick Station or Widdrington Station.

===Air===
Newcastle Airport is under an hour&#x27;s drive from Amble. It provides daily flights to London and regular flights to other UK centres. The airport also operates regular flights to many European destinations, along with destinations in Africa and North America.

==Media==
===Television===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from either the Chatton or Pontop Pike TV transmitter.
===Radio===
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Heart North East, Capital North East, Smooth North East, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Hits Radio North East, and Koast Radio, a community based radio station.

===Newspapers===
The town is served by the newspaper, &quot;Northumberland Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Ambler&quot; which is a free independent community paper that is run by volunteers. Its first edition hit the streets in Amble back in January 2000. 

==Tourism==
Representations were made in 2006 for Amble to be included in the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which ends at the pier. The town is also adjacent to nature reserves operated by Northumberland Wildlife Trust at Cresswell, Druridge and Hauxley.

The town has a caravan park, as well as guest houses and bed and breakfast accommodation for visitors. The Braid, which forms a part of the harbour, is now a greenfield site with a modern marina. In 2009, part of the Braid was legally designated as a Village Green, despite opposition from the council and the withdrawal of the initial application by the person who sought the status.

The nearby Coquet Island is home to many varieties of nesting sea birds, including puffins and the rare Roseate tern. Access is restricted but there are various providers of boat trips around the island. A £10,000 grant was awarded to promote the town with a &quot;Puffin Festival&quot; during the last two weeks of May 2013, when the presence of that species on the island is at its peak. It was hoped that the grant would also encourage local people to use the town&#x27;s shops.

== Friendliest port ==
In the 1930s, when the RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; was heading on her last voyage to the breaker&#x27;s yard at Rosyth, the town council of Amble sent a telegram to the ship saying &quot;still the finest ship on the seas&quot;. The &quot;Mauretania&quot; replied with greetings &quot;to the last and kindliest port in England&quot;.

The new line, which was officially opened on 22 August 2017, provides a main-line high-speed rail service that passes through Pyeongchang from west to east, with KTX trains calling at Pyeongchang station and Jinbu station (for the Olympic Stadium). KTX trains to Jinbu station were increased for the duration of the 2018 Olympics.

<text>Charles Sebastian Thomas Cabot (6 July 1918 – 23 August 1977) was a British actor. He is best remembered as the gentleman&#x27;s gentleman Giles French in the CBS-TV sitcom &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1966–1971). He was also known for playing the Wazir in the film &quot;Kismet&quot; (1955) and Dr. Carl Hyatt in the CBS-TV series &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1960–1962).

Cabot was also a voice performer in many Disney animated films. He made one of his first contributions in &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963), as both the narrator and Lord Ector. He later played Bagheera in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967). His longest-standing role came through the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; series, in which he narrated &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; (1966), &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; (1968), &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977).

==Early life==
Charles Sebastian Thomas Cabot was born on 6 July 1918 in London. At the age of 14, he left school to work in an automotive garage, where he served as chauffeur and valet for British actor Frank Pettingell.

Cabot became interested in theatre, and after becoming acquainted with other actors and having worked for Pettingell, he joined a repertory company. Cabot admitted that in gaining employment as an actor he lied about previous acting credits. Cabot stated later in a 1968 interview that he believed acting was a type of lying, and he had gained a smoothness in his speech while serving as Pettingell&#x27;s dressing room butler. He initially used an agency to find acting employment. Without attending any drama school, Cabot learned the hard way, having been fired on his first day in a show called &quot;On The Spot&quot;. However, finding more work, Cabot&#x27;s confidence in his acting skills increased, and he was soon receiving personal calls for employment.

==Career==
His formal acting career began with a bit part in &quot;Foreign Affaires&quot; (1935); his first screen credit was in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936). Other British films followed such as &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; (1941), &quot;Pimpernel Smith&quot; (also 1941), &quot;Old Mother Riley Overseas&quot; and &quot;Old Mother Riley Detective&quot; (both 1943) and &quot;They Made Me a Fugitive&quot; (1947). In 1946, he portrayed Iago in a condensed short film version of &quot;Othello&quot;. Post-war, Cabot landed roles in such British films as &quot;Third Time Lucky&quot; (1949), &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot; (1949), as the villainous Fouracada in &quot;Dick Barton Strikes Back&quot; (1949); he was also in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Love Lottery&quot; (1954). He appeared in a couple of international productions, the Spanish-UK-USA Sinbad comedy &quot;Babes in Bagdad&quot; (1952) and the Italian version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1954) as Lord Capulet, before moving to the United States, where he worked for Disney on &quot;Westward Ho, the Wagons!&quot; (1956) and as the scheming landlord Jonathan Lyte in &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; (1957). In George Pal&#x27;s production of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960) he was Dr. Hillyer who doubts the time traveller&#x27;s story. Meanwhile, Cabot had begun to work as a voice actor. In the 1950s he was featured in a radio show called &quot;Horizons West,&quot; a 13-part radio drama which followed the story of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and was the voice of Noah in the first recording of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s biblical &#x27;musical play&#x27; &quot;The Flood&quot; (1962). He also did voice parts for animated films such as Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963) as Sir Ector and in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967) as Bagheera.

About this time Cabot began taking on television work. He was the host of the syndicated &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; series, and he portrayed the Count of Brisemont on &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and Andrew Crippen on &quot;The Beachcomber&quot;. 

He also appeared in such series as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (as the title character &quot;Professor Jacoby&quot;, an obnoxious, ruthless, unsympathetic photographer in the like-named S2E28&#x27;s &quot;The Photographer&quot;), plus in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Hiram Holliday&quot; (1956–57), on the detective series &quot;Meet McGraw&quot; (1958), in the western series &quot;Bonanza&quot; (&quot;The Spanish Grant&quot;, 1960) and &quot;Pony Express&quot; (&quot;The Story of Julesburg&quot;, 1960), &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; (various roles 1961–1971), and as an affable demon in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;A Nice Place to Visit,&quot; 1960), Season 1 Episode 28, which aired on 4/14/1960. Cabot had a two-year period as one of the three leads as college professor Dr. Carl Hyatt on the detective show &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1960–1962). As &quot;Checkmate&quot; fit into the CBS Saturday schedule, Cabot appeared as Eric Whitaker in the 1960 episode &quot;Five O&#x27;Clock Friday&quot; on the ABC adventure series, &quot;The Islanders&quot;. Cabot was a regular panellist on the television game show &quot;Stump the Stars&quot;. He appeared on the NBC interview programme &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. In 1964, he hosted the television series &quot;Suspense&quot; and voiced or narrated a few other film and television projects. In 1965, Cabot played a role on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; as Lucas Sebastian, a billionaire entrepreneur who wanted Jed Clampett to invest in his new venture of undersea farming.

He was cast from 1966 to 1971 as Giles French in the CBS series &quot;Family Affair.&quot; Cabot did not halt his other film and television work during the run of &quot;Family Affair&quot;, but he took a leave of absence from the series at one point. Cabot was also the host of &quot;Journey to Midnight&quot;, as well as other work from the period. He was so vividly etched as French in viewers&#x27; minds that he never shook the image even after &quot;Family Affair&quot; ended production in 1971. 

Cabot received another role as the host (Winston Essex) of &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1972), a supernatural anthology (it was retitled &quot;Circle of Fear&quot; after he left the show). Following the series&#x27; demise, he played Kris Kringle in the television remake of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1973). The role required Cabot to shave the trademark beard he sported since 1957 as makeup crews were unable to make it look Santa-like. Cabot appeared in another Christmas project, the television film &quot;The City That Forgot About Christmas&quot; (1974), and narrated two more &quot;Pooh&quot; projects, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too!&quot; and &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;. He also released an album of spoken recitations of songs by Bob Dylan, as &quot;Sebastian Cabot, actor/Bob Dylan, poet&quot;, in 1967. Two tracks from this album appear on the Rhino Records compilation &quot;Golden Throats: The Great Celebrity Sing Off&quot;.

On Broadway, Cabot portrayed Buckram in &quot;Love for Love&quot; (1947).

== Death ==
On 23 August 1977, Cabot suffered a stroke at his home near Victoria, British Columbia and was taken to a Victoria hospital, where he died at the age of 59. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

==Legacy==
On an episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, on 12 December 2012, comedian Billy Crystal mentioned Cabot in humorous dialogue with the host David Letterman. Letterman commented that Cabot&#x27;s name had not been heard in 30 years. Directly before the commercial break Sebastian Cabot&#x27;s photo was shown on national television as a tribute.

<text>Bawtry is a market town and civil parish in the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. It lies south-east of Doncaster, west of Gainsborough and north-west of Retford, on the border with Nottinghamshire and close to Lincolnshire. The town was historically divided between the West Riding of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. Its population of 3,204 in the 2001 UK census increased to 3,573 in 2011, and was put at 3,519 in 2019. Nearby settlements include Austerfield, Everton, Scrooby, Blyth, Bircotes and Tickhill.

==History==

The origin of the name &quot;Bawtry&quot; is uncertain, but it is thought to contain the Old English words &quot;ball&quot; (&quot;ball&quot;) and &quot;trēow&quot; (&quot;tree&quot;), so meaning it was a &quot;(place at) ball-shaped tree&quot;. It was not mentioned in the Domesday Book, but it appears as &quot;Baltry&quot; in 1199 and as &quot;Bautre&quot; on a 1677 map.

Bawtry was originally the site of a Roman settlement on Ermine Street between Doncaster and Lincoln. In 616 AD, the Anglo-Saxon King Aethelfrith died in battle against Raedwald, King of East Anglia, by the River Idle at Bawtry. The site in Aethelfrith&#x27;s time lay in the southern reaches of Northumbria, a dangerous marshy region close to the border with Lindsey and easily accessible from the Kingdom of East Anglia.

A settlement developed here around a wharf in the Danelaw era. Evidence suggests that St Nicholas&#x27;s Church was first erected in that period. While the village originally lay in Nottinghamshire, boundary changes before the Norman conquest moved it just inside the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Around 1200, a new town was developed adjacent to the older village, under the auspices of John de Busli or Robert de Vipont. In 1213, de Vipont received a royal charter specifying an annual four-day fair at Pentecost, and a market was first recorded in 1247. The town grew as a river port and as a local commercial centre and stopping point between Doncaster and Retford. By the mid-14th century, the port was exporting wool and other items overseas. Meanwhile, the Hospital of St Mary Magdalene was founded, which survived until the 18th century.

Trading in Bawtry later declined and by the 1540s John Leland recorded it as being &quot;very bare and pore&quot;, but it grew again in the Elizabethan period through the shipping of millstones.

Bawtry Hall was the base for RAF No.1 Group Bomber Command during and after the Second World War, and became the headquarters of RAF Strike Command (see RAF Bawtry).

==Geography==

Bawtry is where the western branch of the Roman Ermine Street crosses the River Idle in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, South Yorkshire. It straddles the A638 road, previously the Great North Road.

Nearby towns include Gainsborough to the east, Retford to the south-southeast, Worksop to the south-west and Doncaster to the north-west. The town is just south of Doncaster Sheffield Airport, formerly RAF Finningley, and between Bircotes and Misson at the conjunction of the A614, A631 and A638. In the 20th century Bawtry became a bottleneck, until a bypass was eventually built in 1965. The county boundary with Nottinghamshire runs just to the south of the town – the southernmost house on the Great North Road names itself &quot;Number One Yorkshire&quot;.

The town&#x27;s former prosperity was based on communications: the River Idle when it was a port, the Great North Road in the coaching era, and the Great Northern Railway. Its geographical location is 53° 25&#x27; 40&quot; North, 1° 1&#x27; West, at an elevation of some above sea level.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire (West). Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. The Belmont TV transmitter can also be received which broadcast BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire (East). Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Sine FM, Greatest Hits Radio South Yorkshire, and TX1 Radio. The town is served by local newspaper, &quot;Doncaster Free Press&quot;.

==Community facilities==
Bawtry has a school called Bawtry Mayflower School named after the vessel &quot;Mayflower&quot;, which took William Bradford, leader of the Pilgrims, to the Americas, settling the first Plymouth Colony. Bradford came from Austerfield, about a mile from Bawtry.

The &quot;White Hart&quot; in Swan Street is the town&#x27;s oldest surviving public house, dating from 1689. The older &quot;Swan Inn&quot; in the same street has been converted to other uses. Market Hill and High Street contain buildings of the same period, interspersed with more recent ones. The &quot;Crown Hotel&quot; in High Street was once a coaching inn. Singer Ronan Keating and comedian Billy Connolly have stayed there.

South Parade is a terrace of Georgian houses. The Courtyard, a modern development of housing, shops and businesses, won the Green Apple Awards 2005.

From 1989 to 2013 Bawtry Hall operated as a Christian conference centre and a base for several Christian bodies. It now serves for a wider range of events such as wedding receptions.

<text>The Kingdom of Poland (; Latin: &quot;Regnum Poloniae&quot;) was a monarchy in Central Europe during the medieval period from 1025 until 1385.

== Background == 

The West Slavic tribe of Polans who lived in what is today the historic region of Greater Poland, gave rise to a state in the early 10th century, which would become the nascent predecessor of the Kingdom of Poland. Following the Christianization of Poland in 966, and the emergence of the Duchy of Poland during the rule of Mieszko I, his eldest son Bolesław I the Brave inherited his father&#x27;s dukedom and subsequently was crowned as king.

== History == 
=== Establishment ===
In 1025, Bolesław I the Brave of the Piast dynasty was crowned as the first King of Poland at the cathedral in Gniezno and elevated the status of Poland from a duchy to a kingdom after receiving permission for his coronation from Pope John XIX. Following the death of Bolesław, his son Mieszko II Lambert inherited the crown and a vast territory after his father, which included Greater Poland (with Mazovia), Lesser Poland, Silesia, Pomerania, Lusatia, Moravia, Red Ruthenia, and Upper Hungary. However, in 1031, he was forced to renounce the title and flee the country when a series of peasant uprisings broke out in what became known as the pagan reaction, and Yaroslav I the Wise, the Grand Prince of Kiev, invaded the country from the east while Mieszko II was in Lusatia fighting the Holy Roman Emperor, Conrad II. Yaroslav I installed his ally, the half-brother of Mieszko II, Duke Bezprym, as the ruler of Poland. However, as a result of the upheavals, the kingdom suffered territorial losses and was effectively reduced to a duchy. 

Casimir I the Restorer managed to reunite parts of the kingdom following the crisis and moved the capital to Kraków. However, he failed to reinstitute the monarchy due to opposition from the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1076, Bolesław II the Bold, with the support of Pope Gregory VII, regained the royal crown but was later excommunicated and banished from the kingdom in 1079 for murdering his opponent, Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepanów. In 1079, Władysław I Herman, who never pursued kingship took over the reins after the expulsion of Bolesław II. Władysław I was disinterested in becoming king and the country was effectively run by wojewoda Sieciech.

=== Feudal fragmentation ===
In 1102, Bolesław III Wrymouth became the ruler of Poland. Unlike Władysław I, Bolesław III proved to be a capable leader who restored the full territorial integrity of Poland but ultimately was not able to obtain the royal crown due to continued opposition from the Holy Roman Empire. Upon his death in 1138, the country was divided between his sons into the duchies of Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Masovia, Silesia, Sandomierz, and a Pomeranian vassal. As a result, Poland entered a period of feudal fragmentation that lasted for over 200 years. 

During the first half of the 13th century, the Silesian Piasts attempted to restore the kingdom. Henry the Bearded undertook efforts to reunite the fragmented duchies through a combination of political maneuvering and conquest. He also undertook efforts towards the coronation of his son, Henry II the Pious, and negotiated with other Polish dukes and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, to this end. Henry II, continued his father&#x27;s efforts, but the first Mongol invasion in 1241 and his death at the Battle of Legnica, abruptly halted the unification process. 

=== Reunified kingdom ===

The next attempt to restore the monarchy and unify the Polish kingdom would occur in 1296, when Przemysł II was crowned as the King of Poland in Gniezno. The coronation did not require papal consent as the title of king was already instituted in 1025. However, his reign was short-lived, as he was murdered by assassins sent by the margraviates of Brandenburg. After the killing of Przemysł II, next to take the title of king was Wenceslaus II of Bohemia from the Czech Přemyslid dynasty, who reigned until 1305. Following a vacancy that lasted until 1320, the Kingdom of Poland was fully restored under Władysław I the Elbow-High, who was crowned at the Wawel cathedral in Kraków, and then subsequently strengthened by his son Casimir III the Great, who expanded into Red Ruthenia. However, he had to renounce his claims to Silesia in order to secure peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Casimir III is the only Polish king to receive the title &quot;Great&quot;, and his reign was marked by substantial developments in the kingdom&#x27;s urban infrastructure, civic administration, and military strength. After his death on 5 November 1370, the rule of the Piast dynasty would come to an end.

Following the death of Casimir III, who died without an heir, Louis I of Hungary from the House of Anjou became king in 1370. The period of his transitional rule also marked the rise of the nobility in the political life of the country. When Louis I died in 1382, his daughter Jadwiga took over the throne as King of Poland. Her advisors negotiated with Jogaila of Lithuania, concerning a potential marriage to Jadwiga. Jogaila pledged to convert to Christianity and signed the Union of Krewo in 1385. The agreement also heralded a change in the legal status of the Polish realm to that of a Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, which was a political concept that assumed unbroken unity, indivisibility and continuity of the state. According to this concept, the Kingdom of Poland ceased to be the patrimonial property of a monarch or dynasty, and became a common good of the political community of the Polish kingdom. After the conclusion of the union, Queen Jadwiga married Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned as King Władysław II Jagiełło on 4 March 1386, an event that marked the beginning of the Jagiellon dynasty.

<text>The mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) is a member of the dove family, Columbidae. The bird is also known as the American mourning dove, the rain dove, the chueybird, colloquially as the turtle dove, and it was once known as the Carolina pigeon and Carolina turtledove. It is one of the most abundant and widespread North American birds and a popular gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six broods of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of sonation. The bird is a strong flier, capable of speeds up to .

Mourning doves are light gray and brown and generally muted in color. Males and females are similar in appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate and care for the young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.

== Taxonomy ==
In 1731, the English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the passenger pigeon and the mourning dove on successive pages of his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. For the passenger pigeon he used the common name &quot;Pigeon of passage&quot; and the scientific Latin &quot;Palumbus migratorius&quot;; for the mourning dove he used &quot;Turtle of Carolina&quot; and &quot;Turtur carolinensis&quot;. In 1743, the naturalist George Edwards included the mourning dove with the English name &quot;long-tail&#x27;d dove&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Columba macroura&quot; in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards&#x27;s pictures of the male and female doves were drawn from live birds that had been shipped to England from the West Indies. In 1758, when the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he conflated the two species. He used the Latin name &quot;Columba macroura&quot; introduced by Edwards as the binomial name but included a description mainly based on Catesby. He cited Edwards&#x27;s description of the mourning dove and Catesby&#x27;s description of the passenger pigeon. Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; again in 1766 for the twelfth edition. He dropped &quot;Columba macroura&quot; and instead coined &quot;Columba migratoria&quot; for the passenger pigeon, &quot;Columba cariolensis&quot; for the mourning dove and &quot;Columba marginata&quot; for Edwards&#x27;s mourning dove.

To resolve the confusion over the binomial names of the two species, Francis Hemming proposed in 1952 that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) secure the specific name &quot;macroura&quot; for the mourning dove and &quot;migratorius&quot; for the passenger pigeon, since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description. This was accepted by the ICZN, which used its plenary powers to designate the species for the respective names in 1955.

The mourning dove is now placed in the genus &quot;Zenaida&quot;, introduced in 1838 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte, commemorating his wife Zénaïde. The specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek &quot;makros&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot; and &quot;-ouros&quot; meaning &quot;-tailed&quot;.

The mourning dove is closely related to the eared dove (&quot;Zenaida auriculata&quot;) and the Socorro dove (&quot;Zenaida graysoni&quot;). Some authorities consider them a superspecies, and the three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus &quot;Zenaidura&quot;, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus &quot;Zenaida&quot;. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the mourning dove, though several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of &quot;Zenaida&quot;, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of &quot;Zenaida&quot; by making it paraphyletic.

There are five subspecies:
* &quot;Zenaida macroura marginella&quot; (Woodhouse, 1852) – west Canada and west USA to south central Mexico
* &quot;Zenaida macroura carolinensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – east Canada and east USA, Bermuda, Bahama Islands
* &quot;Zenaida macroura macroura&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – (nominate subspecies) Cuba, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), Puerto Rico, Jamaica
* &quot;Zenaida macroura clarionensis&quot; (Townsend, CH, 1890) – Clarion Island (off west Mexico)
* &quot;Zenaida macroura turturilla&quot; (Wetmore, 1956) – Costa Rica, west Panama

The ranges of most of the subspecies overlap a little, with three in the United States or Canada. The West Indian subspecies is found throughout the Greater Antilles. It has recently invaded the Florida Keys. The eastern subspecies is found mainly in eastern North America, as well as Bermuda and the Bahamas. The western subspecies are found in western North America, including parts of Mexico. The Panamanian subspecies is in Central America. The Clarion Island subspecies is found only on Clarion Island, off Mexico&#x27;s Pacific coast.

The mourning dove is sometimes called the &quot;American mourning dove&quot; to distinguish it from the distantly related mourning collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decipiens&quot;) of Africa. It was also formerly known as the &quot;Carolina turtledove&quot; and the &quot;Carolina pigeon&quot;. The &quot;mourning&quot; part of its common name comes from its doleful call.

The mourning dove was thought to be the passenger pigeon&#x27;s closest living relative on morphological grounds until genetic analysis showed &quot;Patagioenas&quot; pigeons are more closely related. The mourning dove was even suggested to belong to the same genus, &quot;Ectopistes&quot;, and was listed by some authors as &quot;E. carolinensis&quot;. The passenger pigeon (&quot;Ectopistes migratorius&quot;) was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s.

== Description ==

The mourning dove is a medium-sized, slender dove approximately in length. Mourning doves weigh , usually closer to . The mourning dove has a wingspan of 37–45 cm. The elliptical wings are broad, and the head is rounded. Its tail is long and tapered (&quot;macroura&quot; comes from the Greek words for &quot;large&quot; and &quot;tail&quot;). Mourning doves have perching feet, with three toes forward and one reversed. The legs are short and reddish colored. The beak is short and dark, usually a brown-black hue.

The plumage is generally light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, and the outer tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light blue skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance and are generally darker.

Feather colors are generally believed to be relatively static, changing only by small amounts over periods of months. However, a 2011 study argued that since feathers have neither nerves or blood vessels, color changes must be caused by external stimuli. Researchers analyzed how feathers of iridescent mourning doves responded to stimulus changes of adding and evaporating water. As a result, it was discovered that iridescent feather color changed hue, became more chromatic, and increased overall reflectance by almost 50%. Transmission electron microscopy and thin-film models revealed that color is produced by thin-film interference from a single layer of keratin around the edge of feather barbules, under which lies a layer of air and melanosomes. Once the environmental conditions were changed, the most striking morphological difference was a twisting of colored barbules that exposed more of their surface area for reflection, which explains the observed increase in brightness. Overall, the researchers suggest that some plumage colors may be more changeable than previously thought possible.

All five subspecies of the mourning dove look similar and are not easily distinguishable. The nominate subspecies possesses shorter wings and are darker and more buff-colored than the &quot;average&quot; mourning dove. &quot;Z. m. carolinensis&quot; has longer wings and toes, a shorter beak, and is darker in color. The western subspecies has longer wings, a longer beak and shorter toes, and is more muted and lighter in color. The Panama mourning dove has shorter wings and legs, a longer beak, and is grayer in color. The Clarion Island subspecies possesses larger feet, a larger beak, and is darker brown in color.

===Vocalization===
This species&#x27; call is a distinctive, plaintive &#x27;, uttered by males to attract females, and it may be mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard preceding the first coo.) Other sounds include a nested call (&#x27;) by paired males to attract their female mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft &#x27;) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short &#x27;) by either a male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound that is hard to hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing. The mourning dove can also &#x27;clap&#x27; its wings together when taking off, in a similar manner to the rock dove.

== Distribution and habitat==

The mourning dove has a large range of nearly . The species is resident throughout the Greater Antilles, most of Mexico, the Continental United States, southern Canada, and the Atlantic archipelago of Bermuda. Much of the Canadian prairie sees these birds in summer only, and southern Central America sees them in winter only. The species is a vagrant in northern Canada, Alaska, and South America. It has been spotted as an accidental at least seven times in the Western Palearctic with records from the British Isles (5), the Azores (1) and Iceland (1). In 1963, the mourning dove was introduced to Hawaii, and in 1998 there was still a small population in North Kona. The mourning dove also appeared on Socorro Island, off the western coast of Mexico, in 1988, sixteen years after the Socorro dove was extirpated from that island.

The mourning dove occupies a wide variety of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas. It avoids swamps and thick forest.
=== Migration ===
Most mourning doves migrate along flyways over land. Birds in Canada migrate the farthest, probably wintering in Mexico or further south. Those that spend the summer further south are more sedentary, with much shorter migrations. At the southern part of their range, Mourning Doves are present year-round.

Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Mourning doves sunbathe or rain bathe by lying on the ground or a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also water bathe in shallow pools or birdbaths. Dustbathing is common as well.

Outside the breeding season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.
===Breeding===

Courtship begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, the male will approach the female with a puffed-out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs will often preen each other&#x27;s feathers.

The male then leads the female to potential nest sites, and the female will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, and bring it to her. The male will stand on the female&#x27;s back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.

Most nests are in trees, both deciduous and coniferous. Sometimes, they can be found in shrubs, vines, or on artificial constructs like buildings, or hanging flower pots. When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.

The clutch size is almost always two eggs. Occasionally, however, a female will lay her eggs in the nest of another pair, leading to three or four eggs in the nest. The eggs are white, , long, wide, at laying (5–6% of female body mass). Both sexes incubate, the male from morning to afternoon, and the female the rest of the day and at night. Mourning doves are devoted parents; nests are very rarely left unattended by the adults.

Incubation takes two weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are strongly altricial, being helpless at hatching and covered with down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon&#x27;s milk (crop milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after they are capable of digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.

Mourning doves are prolific breeders. In warmer areas, these birds may raise up to six broods in a season. This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high. Each year, mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.

The mourning dove is generally monogamous and forms strong pair bonds.

===Feeding===
Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, which make up more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for rapeseed, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead, they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.

Mourning doves show a preference for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, and wheat. When their favorite foods are absent, mourning doves will eat the seeds of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.

===Predators and parasites===
The primary predators of this species are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize mourning dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove&#x27;s vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.

Mourning doves can be afflicted with several different diseases and parasites, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish growth in the mouth and esophagus that will eventually starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.

== Conservation status ==

The number of individual mourning doves was estimated to be approximately 475 million in 1994, More recent reports indicate that there were approximately 346 million doves in the US as of September 2023. The large population and its vast range explain why the mourning dove is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk. As a gamebird, the mourning dove is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year. However, reporting cautions that mourning doves are in decline in the western United States, and susceptible everywhere in the country due to lead poisoning as they eat spent shot leftover in hunting fields. In some cases, the fields are specifically planted with a favored seed plant to lure them to those sites.

== In culture ==

A Huron/Wyandot legend tells of a maiden named Ayu&#x27;ra (modernly spelled Iohara) who used to care for the bird, who came to love her a great deal. One day, she became sick and died. As her spirit traveled across the land to the entrance to the Underworld, all the doves followed her and tried to gain entrance into the Underworld alongside her. Sky Woman, the deity who guards this door, refused them entry, eventually creating smoke to blind them and take Ayu&#x27;ra&#x27;s spirit away without their knowledge. The smoke stained their feathers gray and they have been in mourning for the maiden&#x27;s loss ever since. The logic behind the story is a play on words—the sound many Native Americans attributed to the bird was &quot;howe howe,&quot; and this is also the sound the Iroquoian peoples used to chant over the dead at funerary events.

The eastern mourning dove (&quot;Z. m. carolinensis&quot;) is Wisconsin&#x27;s official symbol of peace. The bird is also Michigan&#x27;s state bird of peace.

The mourning dove appears as the Carolina turtle-dove on plate 286 of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;.

References to mourning doves appear frequently in Native American literature. Mourning Dove was the pen name of Christine Quintasket, one of the first published Native American women authors. Mourning dove imagery also turns up in contemporary American and Canadian poetry in the work of poets as diverse as Robert Bly, Jared Carter, Lorine Niedecker, and Charles Wright.

The mourning dove is mentioned on the Nick Cave and Warren Ellis track, &quot;Wood Dove&quot;, for the &quot;For the Birds: The Birdsong Project&quot;, Vol. 1.

The mourning dove is also mentioned in other musical tracks, including Ray Charles&#x27; rendition of the popular blues song &quot;Careless Love&quot; and &quot;I Love You, I Love You (I Will Never Let You Go)&quot;.

<text>Étienne or Estienne de La Boétie (; ; 1 November 1530 – 18 August 1563) was a French magistrate, classicist, writer, poet and political theorist, best remembered for his friendship with essayist Michel de Montaigne. His early political treatise &quot;Discourse on Voluntary Servitude&quot; was posthumously adopted by the Huguenot movement and is sometimes seen as an early influence on modern anti-statist, utopian and civil disobedience thought.

== Life ==
La Boétie was born in Sarlat, in the Périgord region of southwest France, in 1530 to an aristocratic family. His father was a royal official of the Périgord region and his mother was the sister of the president of the Bordeaux Parliament (assembly of lawyers). Orphaned at an early age, he was brought up by his uncle and namesake, the curate of Bouilbonnas, and received his law degree from the University of Orléans in 1553. His great and precocious ability earned La Boétie a royal appointment to the Bordeaux Parliament the following year, despite his being under the minimum age. There he pursued a distinguished career as judge and diplomatic negotiator until his untimely death from illness in 1563 at the age of thirty-two. La Boétie was also a distinguished poet and humanist, translating Xenophon and Plutarch, and being closely connected with the leading young Pleiade group of poets, including Pierre de Ronsard, Jean Daurat and Jean-Antoine de Baïf. La Boétie was favorable to the conciliation of Catholicism and Protestantism; &quot;warned of the dangerous and divisive consequences of permitting two religions, which could lead to two opposed states in the same country. The most he would have allowed the Protestants was the right to worship in private, and he pointed out their own intolerance of Catholics. His policy for religious peace was one of conciliation and concord through reforms in the church that would eventually persuade the Protestants to reunite with Catholicism&quot;. He served with Montaigne in the Bordeaux &quot;parlement&quot; and is immortalized in Montaigne&#x27;s essay on friendship. Some historians have questioned whether the two were lovers or not, but each played influential roles in each other&#x27;s lives regardless.

== Writings ==
La Boétie&#x27;s writings include a few sonnets, translations from the classics and an essay attacking absolute monarchy and tyranny in general, &quot;Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr&#x27;un&quot; (&quot;Discourse on Voluntary Servitude, or the Anti-Dictator&quot;). The essay asserts that tyrants have power because the people give it to them. Liberty has been abandoned once by society, which afterward stayed corrupted and prefers the slavery of the courtesan to the freedom of one who refuses to dominate as he refuses to obey. Thus, La Boétie linked obedience and domination, a relationship which would be later theorised by latter anarchist thinkers. By advocating a solution of simply refusing to support the tyrant, he became one of the earliest advocates of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. Murray N. Rothbard summarizes La Boétie&#x27;s political philosophy as follows: To him, the great mystery of politics was obedience to rulers. Why in the world do people agree to be looted and otherwise oppressed by government overlords? It is not just fear, Boetie explains in the &quot;Discourse on Voluntary Servitude&quot;, for our consent is required. And that consent can be non-violently withdrawn. 

It was once thought following Montaigne&#x27;s claims that La Boétie wrote the essay in 1549 at the age of eighteen, but recent authorities argue that it is &quot;likely that the &quot;Discourse&quot; was written in 1552 or 1553, at the age of twenty-two, while La Boétie was at the university&quot;. Some Montaigne scholars have argued that the essay was in fact the work of Montaigne himself. The essay was circulated privately and not published until 1576 after La Boétie&#x27;s death. He died in Germignan near Bordeaux in 1563. His last days are described in a long letter from Montaigne to his own father.

==Influence==
In the 20th century, many European anarchists began to cite La Boétie as an influence, including Gustav Landauer, Bart de Ligt and Simone Weil. Autonomist Marxist thinker John Holloway also cites him in his book &quot;Crack Capitalism&quot; in order to explain his idea of &quot;breaking with capitalism&quot;. Gene Sharp, the leading theorist of nonviolent struggle, cites his work frequently in both &quot;The Politics of Nonviolent Action&quot; and &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy&quot;.

<doc id="393258" wikidata="Q620595" url="?curid=393258" title="Dirichlet series">
<text>In mathematics, a Dirichlet series is any series of the form
formula_1
where &quot;s&quot; is complex, and formula_2 is a complex sequence. It is a special case of general Dirichlet series.

Dirichlet series play a variety of important roles in analytic number theory. The most usually seen definition of the Riemann zeta function is a Dirichlet series, as are the Dirichlet L-functions. Specifically, the Riemann zeta function &quot;ζ(s)&quot; is the Dirichlet series of the constant unit function &quot;u(n)&quot;, namely:
formula_3
where &quot;D(u, s)&quot; denotes the Dirichlet series of &quot;u(n)&quot;.
It is conjectured that the Selberg class of series obeys the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The series is named in honor of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.

==Combinatorial importance==
Dirichlet series can be used as generating series for counting weighted sets of objects with respect to a weight which is combined multiplicatively when taking Cartesian products.

Suppose that &quot;A&quot; is a set with a function &quot;w&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → N assigning a weight to each of the elements of &quot;A&quot;, and suppose additionally that the fibre over any natural number under that weight is a finite set. (We call such an arrangement (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;w&quot;) a weighted set.) Suppose additionally that &quot;an&quot; is the number of elements of &quot;A&quot; with weight &quot;n&quot;. Then we define the formal Dirichlet generating series for &quot;A&quot; with respect to &quot;w&quot; as follows:

:formula_4

Note that if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are disjoint subsets of some weighted set (&quot;U&quot;, &quot;w&quot;), then the Dirichlet series for their (disjoint) union is equal to the sum of their Dirichlet series:

:formula_5

Moreover, if (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) and (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) are two weighted sets, and we define a weight function by

:formula_6

for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;B&quot;, then we have the following decomposition for the Dirichlet series of the Cartesian product:

:formula_7

This follows ultimately from the simple fact that formula_8

==Examples==
The most famous example of a Dirichlet series is

:formula_9

whose analytic continuation to formula_10 (apart from a simple pole at formula_11) is the Riemann zeta function.

Provided that is real-valued at all natural numbers , the respective real and imaginary parts of the Dirichlet series have known formulas where we write formula_12: 

:formula_13

Treating these as formal Dirichlet series for the time being in order to be able to ignore matters of convergence, note that we have:

:formula_14

as each natural number has a unique multiplicative decomposition into powers of primes. It is this bit of combinatorics which inspires the Euler product formula.

Another is:

:formula_15

where is the Möbius function. This and many of the following series may be obtained by applying Möbius inversion and Dirichlet convolution to known series. For example, given a Dirichlet character one has

:formula_16

where is a Dirichlet L-function.

If the arithmetic function has a Dirichlet inverse function formula_17, i.e., if there exists an inverse function such that the Dirichlet convolution of &quot;f&quot; with its inverse yields the multiplicative identity 
formula_18, then the DGF of the inverse function is given by the reciprocal of &quot;F&quot;: 

:formula_19

Other identities include

:formula_20

where formula_21 is the totient function,

:formula_22

where &quot;Jk&quot; is the Jordan function, and

:formula_23

where &quot;σ&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the divisor function. By specialization to the divisor function &quot;d&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;0 we have

:formula_24

The logarithm of the zeta function is given by

:formula_25

where Λ(&quot;n&quot;) is the von Mangoldt function. Similarly, we have that

:formula_26

The logarithmic derivative of the zeta function is then

:formula_27

These last three are special cases of a more general relationship for derivatives of Dirichlet series, given below.

Given the Liouville function &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), one has

:formula_28

Yet another example involves Ramanujan&#x27;s sum:

:formula_29

Another pair of examples involves the Möbius function and the prime omega function:

:formula_30
:formula_31
We have that the Dirichlet series for the prime zeta function, which is the analog to the Riemann zeta function summed only over indices &quot;n&quot; which are prime, is given by a sum over the Moebius function and the logarithms of the zeta function: 

:formula_32

A large tabular catalog listing of other examples of sums corresponding to known Dirichlet series representations is found here. 

Examples of Dirichlet series DGFs corresponding to additive (rather than multiplicative) &quot;f&quot; are given here for the prime omega functions formula_33 and formula_34, which respectively count the number of distinct prime factors of &quot;n&quot; (with multiplicity or not). For example, the DGF of the first of these functions is expressed as the product of the Riemann zeta function and the prime zeta function for any complex &quot;s&quot; with formula_35:

:formula_36

If &quot;f&quot; is a multiplicative function such that its DGF &quot;F&quot; converges absolutely for all formula_37, and if &quot;p&quot; is any prime number, we have that 

:formula_38

where formula_39 is the Moebius function. Another unique Dirichlet series identity generates the summatory function of some arithmetic &quot;f&quot; evaluated at GCD inputs given by 

:formula_40

We also have a formula between the DGFs of two arithmetic functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; related by Moebius inversion. In particular, if formula_41, then by Moebius inversion we have that formula_42. Hence, if &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are the two respective DGFs of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, then we can relate these two DGFs by the formulas: 

:formula_43

There is a known formula for the exponential of a Dirichlet series. If formula_44 is the DGF of some arithmetic &quot;f&quot; with formula_45, then the DGF &quot;G&quot; is expressed by the sum 

:formula_46 

where formula_17 is the Dirichlet inverse of &quot;f&quot; and where the arithmetic derivative of &quot;f&quot; is given by the formula formula_48 for all natural numbers formula_49.

== Analytic properties==
Given a sequence formula_50 of complex numbers we try to consider the value of

:formula_51

as a function of the complex variable &quot;s&quot;. In order for this to make sense, we need to consider the convergence properties of the above infinite series:

If formula_50 is a bounded sequence of complex numbers, then the corresponding Dirichlet series &quot;f&quot; converges absolutely on the open half-plane Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1. In general, if &quot;an&quot; = O(&quot;nk&quot;), the series converges absolutely in the half plane Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; &quot;k&quot; + 1.

If the set of sums 

:formula_53

is bounded for &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot; ≥ 0, then the above infinite series converges on the open half-plane of &quot;s&quot; such that Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 0.

In both cases &quot;f&quot; is an analytic function on the corresponding open half plane.

In general formula_54 is the abscissa of convergence of a Dirichlet series if it converges for formula_55 and diverges for formula_56 This is the analogue for Dirichlet series of the radius of convergence for power series. The Dirichlet series case is more complicated, though: absolute convergence and uniform convergence may occur in distinct half-planes.

In many cases, the analytic function associated with a Dirichlet series has an analytic extension to a larger domain.

=== Abscissa of convergence ===

Suppose 

:formula_57 

converges for some formula_58 

:Proposition 1. formula_59

&quot;Proof.&quot; Note that:

:formula_60

and define 

:formula_61 

where 

:formula_62

By summation by parts we have

:formula_63

:Proposition 2. Define 
::formula_64 
:Then: 
::formula_65 
:is the abscissa of convergence of the Dirichlet series. 

&quot;Proof.&quot; From the definition 

:formula_66 

so that

:formula_67

which converges as formula_68 whenever formula_69 Hence, for every formula_70 such that formula_71 diverges, we have formula_72 and this finishes the proof.

:Proposition 3. If formula_73 converges then formula_74 as formula_75 and where it is meromorphic (formula_76 has no poles on formula_77).

&quot;Proof.&quot; Note that 

:formula_78 

and formula_79 we have by summation by parts, for formula_80

:formula_81

Now find &quot;N&quot; such that for &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot;, formula_82

:formula_83

and hence, for every formula_84 there is a formula_85 such that for formula_86: 

:formula_87

==Formal Dirichlet series==
A formal Dirichlet series over a ring &quot;R&quot; is associated to a function &quot;a&quot; from the positive integers to &quot;R&quot;

:formula_88

with addition and multiplication defined by

:formula_89
:formula_90

where

:formula_91

is the pointwise sum and

:formula_92

is the Dirichlet convolution of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

The formal Dirichlet series form a ring Ω, indeed an &quot;R&quot;-algebra, with the zero function as additive zero element and the function &quot;δ&quot; defined by &quot;δ&quot;(1) = 1, &quot;δ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 0 for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 as multiplicative identity. An element of this ring is invertible if &quot;a&quot;(1) is invertible in &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, so is Ω; if &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain, so is Ω. The non-zero multiplicative functions form a subgroup of the group of units of Ω.

The ring of formal Dirichlet series over C is isomorphic to a ring of formal power series in countably many variables.

==Derivatives==
Given

:formula_93

it is possible to show that

:formula_94

assuming the right hand side converges. For a completely multiplicative function ƒ(&quot;n&quot;), and assuming the series converges for Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; σ0, then one has that

:formula_95

converges for Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; σ0. Here, Λ(&quot;n&quot;) is the von Mangoldt function.

== Products==
Suppose

:formula_96

and

:formula_97

If both &quot;F&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) are absolutely convergent for &quot;s&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot; and &quot;s&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot; then we have

:formula_98

If &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; and &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) we have

: formula_99

==Coefficient inversion (integral formula)==
For all positive integers formula_100, the function &quot;f&quot; at &quot;x&quot;, formula_101, can be recovered from the Dirichlet generating function (DGF) &quot;F&quot; of &quot;f&quot; (or the Dirichlet series over &quot;f&quot;) using the following integral formula whenever formula_102, the abscissa of absolute convergence of the DGF &quot;F&quot; 

:formula_103

It is also possible to invert the Mellin transform of the summatory function of &quot;f&quot; that defines the DGF &quot;F&quot; of &quot;f&quot; to obtain the coefficients of the Dirichlet series (see section below). In this case, we arrive at a complex contour integral formula related to Perron&#x27;s theorem. Practically speaking, the rates of convergence of the above formula as a function of &quot;T&quot; are variable, and if the Dirichlet series &quot;F&quot; is sensitive to sign changes as a slowly converging series, it may require very large &quot;T&quot; to approximate the coefficients of &quot;F&quot; using this formula without taking the formal limit.

Another variant of the previous formula stated in Apostol&#x27;s book provides an integral formula for an alternate sum in the following form for formula_104 and any real formula_105 where we denote formula_106: 

:formula_107

==Integral and series transformations==
The inverse Mellin transform of a Dirichlet series, divided by s, is given by Perron&#x27;s formula. 
Additionally, if formula_108 is the (formal) ordinary generating function of the sequence of formula_109, then an integral representation for the Dirichlet series of the generating function sequence, formula_110, is given by 
:formula_111

Another class of related derivative and series-based generating function transformations on the ordinary generating function of a sequence which effectively produces the left-hand-side expansion in the previous equation are respectively defined in.

==Relation to power series==
The sequence &quot;an&quot; generated by a Dirichlet series generating function corresponding to:

:formula_112

where &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is the Riemann zeta function, has the ordinary generating function:

:formula_113

==Relation to the summatory function of an arithmetic function via Mellin transforms==

If &quot;f&quot; is an arithmetic function with corresponding DGF &quot;F&quot;, and the summatory function of &quot;f&quot; is defined by 

:formula_114 

then we can express &quot;F&quot; by the Mellin transform of the summatory function at formula_115. Namely, we have that 

:formula_116 

For formula_117 and any natural numbers formula_118, we also have the approximation to the DGF &quot;F&quot; of &quot;f&quot; given by 

:formula_119

<doc id="393272" wikidata="Q836046" url="?curid=393272" title="Culture of Hong Kong">
<text>The culture of Hong Kong is primarily a mix of Chinese and Western influences, stemming from Lingnan Cantonese roots and Hong Kong&#x27;s status as a British colony from 1841 to 1997 (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 粵英薈萃). As an international financial center dubbed &quot;Asia&#x27;s World City&quot;, contemporary Hong Kong has also absorbed many international influences from around the world. Moreover, Hong Kong also has indigenous people and ethnic minorities from South and Southeast Asia, whose cultures all play integral parts in modern-day Hong Kong culture. As a result, after the 1997 transfer of sovereignty to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Hong Kong has continued to develop a unique identity under the rubric of One Country, Two Systems.

==History==


==Languages and writing systems==
===Spoken languages===

English and Chinese are the two official languages of Hong Kong. During the British colonial era, English was the sole official language until 1978 but has remained a strong second language in Hong Kong. As the majority of the population in Hong Kong are descendants of migrants from China&#x27;s Canton Province, the vast majority speak standard Cantonese or other Yue Chinese varieties as a first language, with smaller numbers of speakers of Hakka Language or the Teochew dialect of Southern Min. In addition, immigrants and expatriates from the West and other Asian countries have contributed much to Hong Kong&#x27;s linguistic and demographic diversity.

====Hong Kong Cantonese====

Hong Kong Cantonese is the Cantonese language () spoken in Hong Kong. Although it is not one of the Hong Kong indigenous languages, it is the most widely spoken language in Hong Kong nowadays. The Hong Kong style of Cantonese contains many loanwords from English, and also some from Japanese, due to Japan being one of Hong Kong&#x27;s biggest trade partners and the popularity of Japanese pop culture in the city in the past few decades. Nevertheless, Hong Kong Cantonese is still mutually intelligible with the Cantonese spoken by Cantonese people from mainland China or overseas Chinese of Cantonese ancestry. Cantonese is also the primary language used in Hong Kong cultural products (pop songs, movies, etc.).

One distinctive trait of Hong Kong&#x27;s Cantonese is that, due to British cultural influences, Hong Kongers are noted to have a habit of sprinkling their Cantonese with English words, resulting in a new speech pattern called &quot;Kongish&quot;.

====Non-Cantonese Sinitic languages====
Hakka language (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 客家話) is commonly used in many walled villages (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 圍村) in New Territories and Hakka ethnic communities in Hong Kong, being one of the indigenous languages for Hong Kong indigenous peoples. Hakka is, like Cantonese and Mandarin, a member of the Chinese language family, but has close to zero mutual intelligibility with either. Hakka people also has a distinct culture, differing from Cantonese also in terms of traditional architecture, music, cuisine, and other customs.

Waitau language (Jyutping: Wai4 tau4 waa2; Traditional Chinese: 圍頭話), another of Hong Kong&#x27;s indigenous languages, is mostly spoken by the older generation living in walled villages in New Territories. Lastly, the Tanka people (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 蜑家人) from the fishing villages is another group of Hong Kong indigenous peoples. Their language, Tanka (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 蜑家話), with their own version of Cantonese, is another form of Hong Kong indigenous languages.

====Government linguistic policy====
Since the 1997 handover, the government has adopted the &quot;biliterate and trilingual&quot; (Jyutping: Loeng3 man4 saam1 jyu5; Traditional Chinese: 兩文三語, literally &quot;two writing systems and three languages&quot;) policy. Under this principle, &quot;Chinese&quot; (somewhat ambiguously) and English must both be acknowledged as official languages, with Cantonese being acknowledged as the de facto official (at least spoken) variety of Chinese in Hong Kong, while also accepting the use of Mandarin (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 普通話) in certain occasions.

===Writing systems===

In terms of writing systems, Hong Kongers write using Traditional Chinese characters, which not only employ, under varying circumstances, variant and classical characters used since imperial years, but also cover all of the words in Mandarin-based Vernacular Chinese, the language in which government documents and most works of literature are written. With the aid of Cantonese characters invented by Hong Kongers, the Cantonese language can now be written verbatim, and written Cantonese have been becoming more prevalent since the turn of the 21st century, especially in less formal spheres such as internet forums and advertisements.

==Cultural identity==
156 years of rule as a separate British colony, as well as political separation from the rest of Lingnan have resulted in a unique local identity. Elements of traditional Cantonese culture combined with British influences have shaped Hong Kong in every aspect of the city, spanning from law, politics, education, languages, cuisines, and the way of thinking. It is for this reason that many Hong Kongers are proud of their culture (such as the Cantonese language, which has a 1000-year-long history and a rich heritage of traditional songs and poems) and generally refer themselves as &quot;Hongkongers&quot; (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 香港人), to distinguish themselves from the Han Chinese from mainland China (whose culture developed independently). The sense of Hong Kong people asserting their unique identity and nationality has increased over time. This is due to the rising phenomena of conflicts between Hong Kongers and the Mainlanders.

Academic Kam Louie described Hong Kong&#x27;s colonial past as creating a &quot;translation space where Chinese-ness was interpreted for &#x27;Westerners&#x27; and Western-ness translated for Chinese.&quot;

After the handover of Hong Kong, the University of Hong Kong surveyed Hong Kong residents about how they defined themselves. In its latest poll published in June 2022, 39.1% of respondents identified as Hong Konger, 31.4% as Hong Konger in China, 17.6% as Chinese, 10.9% as Chinese in Hong Kong, and 42.4% as mixed identity. In a 2023 Pew Research survey, adults in Hong Kong were most likely to identify as both Chinese and Hong Konger (53%), followed by those who identify primarily a Hong Konger (36%), and solely as Chinese (10%).

Hong Kong&#x27;s &#x27;identity crisis&#x27; did not arise only because of conflicts between &#x27;original&#x27; Hong Kong people and mainland China. As Hong Kong was developed from a fishing village into an international financial city, many middle class individuals yearned for Western or international lifestyles and culture.  The mix of east and west, old and new, has offered Hong Kong people a diverse variety of choices but at the same time confusions. The rapid growth and prosperity and population happened in the 1960s to 1980s when the world was also influenced by globalisation.

==Society==

In Hong Kong, traditional Confucian-derived values such as &quot;family solidarity&quot;, &quot;courtesy&quot; and &quot;saving face&quot; carry significant weight in the minds of the people. Hong Kong&#x27;s mainstream culture is derived from and heavily influenced by the Cantonese from the neighbouring province of Guangdong (&quot;Gwongdung&quot; in Cantonese) and their culture, which is considerably different from those of other Han Chinese people. There are also small communities of Hakka, Hokkien, Teochew and Shanghainese people in Hong Kong.

Structurally, one of the first laws to define people&#x27;s relationships was the Hong Kong Matrimonial Ordinance passed in 1972. The law set the precedent of banning concubinage and same sex marriages with a strict declaration for heterosexual relationships with one partner only. Other economic changes include families in need of assistance due to both parents working. In particular, foreign domestic helpers have become an integral part of the household since the late 1980s.

==Architecture==

In terms of architecture, Hong Kong shows Cantonese, British, and indigenous influences. She has several styles of architecture, most notably Cantonese architecture and British architecture. The former is due to the presence of a large number of people with Cantonese ancestry, and the latter is most commonly seen in government buildings due to the British being the rulers of the city. Hong Kong&#x27;s indigenous peoples also have their own styles, namely walled villages and pang uk. The major architectural styles that can be found in Hong Kong include:
Hong Kong also contained some Chinese Renaissance style architectures such as King Yin Lei at 45 Stubbs Road, and St Mary&#x27;s Church of Sheng Kung Hui (Anglican Communion) in Hong Kong Island.

==Visual arts==
===Fine arts===
Hong Kong supports a variety of artistic activities. The Hong Kong Arts Centre in Wanchai offers a variety of performance venues and galleries, and is supportive of other arts organisations, while Oi! arts center, located inside the historic Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, aims to promote visual arts in Hong Kong by providing a platform for art exhibitions, forums and other art-related activities. M+ has a focus on twentieth- and twenty-first-century visual culture, including design, architecture, and Hong Kong visual culture. At the international level, Hong Kong hosts the leading contemporary art fair Art Basel in Asia and is a center for new media art with venues such as Microwave International New Media Arts Festival and Videotage. Even in less urban areas of the city, Hong Kongers have also built creative oases such as the Cattle Depot Artist Village and the Fo Tan artistic community. Contemporary visual artists from Hong Kong include Nadim Abbas, Amy Cheung, Choi Yan-chi, Ming Fay, Lai Cheuk Wah Sarah, Tsang Tsou Choi, Ho Sin Tung and Eric Siu.

Hong Kong has recently seen a boom in independent art groups.

====Cantonese fine arts====
Hong Kong also hosts several styles of Lingnan (Cantonese) fine arts, including the Lingnan styles of painting and bonsai. For example, Yeung Sin-sum, who is venerated as &quot;the last master of the Lingnan school of painting&quot;, is based (though not born) in Hong Kong. Hong Kong also has an active club supporting Lingnan penjing (English website).

Hong Kong is also home to modern ink painting, which infuses traditional Chinese ink painting with experimental techniques and approaches. Prominent artists in this field include Lui Shou-kwan, Liu Kuo-sung, and Eddy Chan.

===Graffiti art===

Graffiti art (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 塗鴉) is abundant on Hong Kong streets. The Hong Kong style of graffiti art ranges from calligraphy using Chinese characters to satires against politicians. It is technically illegal in Hong Kong, but lax law enforcement results in the proliferation of graffiti art. Nowadays, graffiti art is omnipresent in the streets of Hong Kong, especially in the busier districts such as Mongkok. The work of Tsang Tsou Choi, one of the most prominent Hong Kong graffiti artists, even had his work sold for more than 50,000 Hong Kong dollars.

Nowadays, many Hong Kongers have started regarding graffiti arts as a symbol of their city and host activities promoting graffiti art.

===Comics===

Hong Kong comics (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 香港漫畫) are Hong Kong-based comic books that have provided an avenue of expression long before the arrival of television. While readership has fluctuated through different decades, the art form is one of the most consistent in terms of providing highly affordable entertainment. Hong Kong comics are regularly available at news stands in most street corners. Characters such as Old Master Q, Chinese hero and many others have showcased Han Chinese artwork and stories (especially Cantonese ones). Japanese manga have also been translated and fused into local comics libraries.

===Canton porcelain===

Hong Kongers, like their fellow Cantonese, have also dabbled in Canton porcelain. Canton porcelain (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 廣彩), also called &quot;Cantonese porcelain&quot;, is a distinct style of porcelain that originated from Canton City, the center of Lingnan culture. It primarily involves a specific set of techniques that enable Cantonese to get various colours onto white porcelain, resulting in porcelain products that are unusually bright and colourful. Hong Kongers has worked on Canton porcelain in the early 20th century and exported their products even to the Western world. Nowadays, however, as the city has shifted her focus to service and finance, it is mostly hobbyists who would spend time on this style of porcelain art.

==Performing arts==
===Music===
====Cantonese opera====
Cantonese opera is one of the major categories in Han Chinese opera, originating in southern China&#x27;s Cantonese culture. Like all branches of Han Chinese opera, it is an art form involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting. Features particular to Cantonese opera include being sung in the Cantonese language, plus its heavy use of makeup and headdresses. Cantonese opera also uses a distinct set of musical instruments. Hong Kong also has a distinct style of Cantonese opera (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 神功戲, literally &quot;opera using effort of gods&quot;) specifically played during Cheung Chau Bun Festival. The art form carries a national identity that goes as far back as the first wave of immigrants to arrive in the 1950s. Nowadays, Sunbeam Theatre is one of the places that hold the tradition. 
====Pop music====
Cantopop (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 粵語流行曲), also called HK-pop, has dominated and become synonymous with local music culture since its birth in Hong Kong, though the gradual fall of Cantopop in the mid-1990s had given rise to other forms of pop culture, mainly Japanese, Korean, and western music. Still, Cantopop enjoys considerable popularity in Cantonese communities across the world. Nowadays, the global influence of Mandarin has slightly influenced the style. Mandopop from Taiwan is gaining ground. Most artists are essentially multilingual, singing in both Cantonese and Mandarin. Hong Kong English pop, Japanese, Korean, and western music are also popular among Hong Kongers.

====Classical music====

Western classical music is also widely appreciated by many Hong Kong people. Many schools provide free musical instrument lessons to their students.  There are also quite a number of professional, amateur and student orchestras performing regularly. The best known orchestra is the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra . The Orchestra was originally called the Sino-British Orchestra, it was renamed the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in 1957 and became a professional orchestra in 1974.  The Orchestra is currently under the direction of Music Director Jaap van Zweden. It won the Gramophone Orchestra of the Year Award 2019. 

Another well known orchestra is Hong Kong Sinfonietta (Chinese: 香港小交響樂團). Established in 1990, one of its main focuses of HK Sinfonietta is to promote classical music to the general public. In 2002, the conductor and music director Wing-sie Yip (葉詠詩) joined the orchestra as the first woman conductor in Hong Kong. She has broadened the base of classical music lovers in the city.

An amateur orchestra organised by the Hong Kong Medical Association, also called the Hong Kong Doctors Orchestra is an orchestra formed in 1989 by a group of doctors who loved classical music. This orchestra has performed in many charity events every year. Its aim is to care for patients and the society, not just by medicines, but also by music.

For Hong Kong youths who are interested in becoming professional musicians, they can attend the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts where they can obtain a master&#x27;s degree, bachelor honours degree in Music majoring in a musical instrument. There are also part-time courses offered by the academy accredited by the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications. Many graduates have become professional players and music teachers.

===Theatres===
Hong Kong theatres include:
* Aurora Theatre Hong Kong
* Hong Kong Cultural Centre
* Ko Shan Theatre
* Lyric Theatre
* Star Hall
* Tea House Theatre
* The Hub
* Xiqu Centre, West Kowloon
* Yau Ma Tei Theatre

===Cinema===

The Hong Kong cinema (Jyutping: ; Cantonese: 港產片) industry has been one of the most successful worldwide, especially during the second half of the 20th century. Having received international recognition for directors such as Wong Kar-wai, it has remained a moderate level of prominence despite a severe slump starting in the mid-1990s. Martial artists and film stars such as Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee are known globally, especially in Chinese settlements overseas, historically most of whom have been of Cantonese ancestry and enjoy Cantonese-language entertainment. Many other Hong Kongers actors have transitioned over to Hollywood, including Chow Yun-fat and John Woo.

====Hong Kong humour====
The cinema of Hong Kong is noted for its brands of martial arts movies and comedy. The latter is said to have its own style of humour, which has been termed &quot;Hong Kong humour&quot; (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 港式幽默) - alluding to British humour. It is said to be characterised by black comedy and, more distinctively, Mo lei tau, and may have been influenced by British humour.

===Television dramas===

Locally produced television dramas by the free-to-air networks of TVB and ATV have been fairly popular during 1970s to mid 2000. They have contributed to a unique cultural identity among the Hong Kongers and served as a cultural resource for the Cantonese community worldwide. Many of the well known dramas were exported to South East Asian countries, the US, Canada and the UK in the form of tapes, then VCD/CDs. Hong Kong was the powerhouse for producing a large number of soap opera TV series in Cantonese dialect. However, the gradual demise of ATV and eventually, TVB, because of worsening quality of TV shows and dramas resulted in greater preference for those produced in China and other Asian nations, namely South Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese TV shows, which now dominate the latest TV trends in Hong Kong.

===Animation===
While Hong Kong has had an endless supply from Japanese anime and US Disney animations, China has been trying hard to revitalise the industry. Hong Kong has made contributions in recent years with productions like &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story: The Tsui Hark Animation&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Most notably, companies like Imagi Animation Studios located directly in the territory are now pushing 3D-CG animations into the market.

McDull is arguably the most prominent among Hong Kongers animations.

===Other performing arts===
In addition to the above, Hong Kong has different kinds of performing arts, including drama, dance, and theater. Hong Kong is home to the first full-time comedy club in Asia, The TakeOut Comedy Club Hong Kong. There are also many government-supported theater companies. More recently, in 2014, Hong Kong had had its first outdoor Shakespeare festival, Shakespeare in the Port performed at Cyberport.

The following performing artist groups originated from and based in Hong Kong have seen modest success even beyond Asia:
*Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, who play Chinese music
*Hong Kong Ballet
*Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra
*Hong Kong Sinfonietta

==Literary culture==

===Print media===

Magazine and newspaper publishers distribute and print in numerous languages, most notably Vernacular Chinese and English. The printed media, especially tabloids but also broadsheet newspapers, lean heavily on sensationalism and celebrity gossips. While the practice is criticised, it continues to sell papers. The media is relatively free from government interference compared to that of mainland China, and newspapers are often politicised; some have even shown skepticism toward the Chinese government in Beijing.

===Broadcasting===

In the early 2000s, Hong Kong had two main broadcast television stations, TVB and ATV. The latter was closed in 2016 after a long series of financial issues, and the refusal of the government to renew its broadcasting license. The former, launched in 1967, was the territory&#x27;s first free-to-air commercial station, and is currently the predominant TV station in the city and can also been seen in the neighbouring Gwongdung province and Macau (via cable). Paid cable and satellite television have also been widespread. Hong Kong&#x27;s soap dramas, comedy series, and a variety of shows have reached mass audiences throughout the world of Chinese languages, primarily Cantonese communities. Many international and pan-Asian broadcasters are also based in Hong Kong, including News Corporation&#x27;s STAR TV.

===Hong Kong literature===

Hong Kong literature is the literature produced in Hong Kong. It started in the early 20th century, where successive waves of migrants from mainland China (mostly of Cantonese ancestry) moved to the British-controlled city in their attempts to escape from the then war-torn China. At first, the educated among these migrants felt much resentment for having to stay in Hong Kong, a &quot;land of Southern Barbarians&quot;. Many of their works revolved around expressing such sentiments. Starting from the 1960s, however, Hong Kong developed in such a high pace that writers started writing about Hong Kong herself, with topics ranging from local current events and cultures. Nowadays, Hong Kong literature has been fully developed, with numerous prolific writers producing works such as proses and novels. Hong Kong literature is characterised by its heavy use of daily life scenarios - meaning that romance, humour, and satires are popular genres, although Hong Kong has also produced several prominent wuxia (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 武俠) and science fiction writers. Prominent writers of Hong Kong literature include:

:Amy Cheung, a writer of romance and proses; Notable works include &quot;Women on the Breadfruit Tree&quot; and &quot;For Love or Money&quot;.
:Chip Tsao, known for writing proses and articles that discuss cultures (especially Western ones).
:Jin Yong, a renowned wuxia writer; Several of his novels have been made into movies and animations.
:Ni Kuang, a science fiction writer; He also has had several of his novels made into movies.

====Cantonese literature====
Lingnan literature was traditionally written in classical Chinese, rather than the peoples&#x27; spoken languages. Despite the attempt to create vernacular forms of writing in the late 19th century, the Greater China region still tend to use Vernacular Chinese, a writing system based on Mandarin, not Cantonese (i.e., the peoples&#x27; language in the Lingnan region), in writing. Hong Kong is no exception. The vast majority of works of Hong Kong literature were composed in Vernacular Chinese. However, starting from the 21st century, Hong Kong, as a cultural center in the region, has developed a complete writing system for Cantonese. Some writers in the city now advocate composing literature in written Cantonese.

==Cuisine==


Cuisine holds an important place in Hong Kong culture. From dim sum, hot pot (&quot;da been lo&quot;), fast food, to the rarest delicacies, Hong Kong carries the reputable label of &quot;Gourmet Paradise&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Fair of Food&quot;. Hong Kong cuisine, which is influenced by both Western (mainly British) and Chinese (mainly Cantonese) cultures, is very diverse. Despite these, it is not simply a collection of cuisine from other regions of the world, but also has its own style: an example would be Dai pai dong, casual outdoor dining restaurant, primarily providing Cantonese foods. Cha chaan teng (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 茶餐廳, literally &quot;tea restaurant&quot;) came from bing sutt (&quot;ice chamber&quot;). In these &quot;tea restaurants&quot;, various set meals are served throughout the day for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner, providing eastern (mostly Cantonese) cuisines, British foods such as egg tarts, and Hong Kong foods, such as Hong Kong-style French toast, Hong Kong drinks, Yin-Yeung, and iced lemon tea.

Another Hong Kong speciality is street foods. Before the 1990s, street foods were offered by hawkers, who are vendors with little carts moving around the streets and selling their traditional snacks. The best known Hong Kong street foods are curry fish balls, soya-braised cuttlefish, stinky tofu, curry pig skins, pig-blood jelly, red bean, green bean sweet soup, siu mai, etc. However, after the 1990s, due to food safety regulations, traffic laws and the like, hawkers started to disappear. They were then replaced by licensed food stores making similar types of snacks. These traditional street foods are still delightful for many Hong Kong people and tourists alike.

There are many special foods and drinks in Hong Kong. Hong Kong-style Cantonese pastries are made by most bakeries in Hong Kong, like egg tarts, pineapple buns, wife cake, jin deui, roasted pork buns, and cream bun. Even pastel de nata, a Portuguese egg tart, is being sold in KFC, the fast-food chain restaurant. Poon choi, a cuisine from Hong Kong&#x27;s walled villages, also sees popularity among Hong Kongers.

==Traditional celebrations==

There are some distinctive holidays that are celebrated in Hong Kong as a part of eastern culture, and not generally in western countries, except among certain overseas Chinese (especially Cantonese) communities. The best-known is Lunar New Year, which occurs approximately a month after Gregorian New Year, variably in late January or early February. In Lunar New Year, Hong Kong people also go to flower fairs by tradition during Lunar New Year, much like Cantonese from the mainland. Other Han Chinese events include the Dragon Boat Festival, where &quot;Zongzi&quot; is made by millions at home as part of the tradition, and Mid-Autumn Festival, which involves the massive purchase of Mooncakes from Chinese bakery shops.

There are also several celebrations found only in Hong Kong, namely the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the Birthday of Che Kung, and Hong Kong Well-wishing Festival.
==Religions and beliefs==

Religion in Hong Kong is varied, although most Hong Kongers are of Cantonese / Guangdong descent and thus practice the Cantonese branch of Chinese folk religion, which also has elements of Confucian doctrines, Mahayana Buddhism and Taoist ritual traditions. In their Taoist traditions, Hong Kongers also show Cantonese characteristics. They, like the Cantonese people in the mainland, traditionally worship Wong Tai Sin and several other Taoist sea deities, such as Hung Shing and Mazu.

According to official statistics for the year 2010, about 50% of the utter population belongs to organised religions, specifically there are: 1.5 million Hong Kong Buddhists, 1 million Taoists, 480,000 Protestants, 353,000 Catholics, 220,000 Muslims, 40,000 Hindus, 10,000 Sikhs, and other smaller communities. A significant amount of the adherents of non-indigenous Chinese religions, in some cases the majority, are Hong Kong citizens of non-Han descent.

The other half of the population mostly takes part in other Chinese folk religions, which comprehend the worship of local gods and ancestors, in many cases not declaring this practice as a religious affiliation in surveys. The traditional Cantonese religiosity, including Mahayana Buddhism, was generally discouraged during the British rule over Hong Kong, which favoured Christianity. With the end of British rule and the handover of the sovereignty of the city-state to China, there has been a revival of Buddhism and Chinese folk religions.

===Hong Kong death traditions===
The art of &quot;asking the dead&quot; (Jyutping: ; Traditional Chinese: 問米) has long been a tradition in Hong Kong. It is often common for living people to want to ask dead people about their lives in the underworld. In these rituals, people bring paper-made garments, paper-made money, and paper-made food to burn them, traditionally believing that this could pass the objects to dead people and give the latter a more comfortable afterlife.

This tradition originated from the Warring States period in China, at about 476 BCE. This is a common ancient practice in certain parts of Southern China and Hong Kong. However, the number of shops supporting this has been on the decline as people increasingly view this as superstition nowadays.

==Leisure==

Hong Kongers devote much time to leisure. Mahjong is a popular social activity. Family and friends may play for hours at festivals and on public holidays in homes and mahjong parlours. The sight of elderly men playing Chinese chess in public parks, surrounded by watching crowds, is also common. Other board games such as Chinese checkers are enjoyed by people of all ages.

Among teenagers, shopping, eating out, karaoke and video games are popular, with Japan being a major source of digital entertainment for cultural and proximity reasons. There are also popular local inventions such as the video game Little Fighter Online. In the mid 20th century, Hong Kong had some of the most up-to-date arcade games available outside Japan. Negative associations were drawn between triads and video game arcades. Nowadays, soaring popularity of home video game consoles have somewhat diminished the arcade culture.

===Shopping===

Hong Kong, nicknamed &quot;shopping paradise&quot;, is well known for its shopping district with multiple department stores. Many imported goods transported to Hong Kong have lower tax duties than the international standard, making most items affordable for the general public.

Hong Kong is identified by its materialistic culture and high levels of consumerism. Shops from the lowest end to the most upscale pack the streets in close proximity. Some popular shopping destinations include Mongkok, Tsim Sha Tsui, and Causeway Bay.

===Gambling===

Gambling is popular in Cantonese culture and Hong Kong is no different. Movies such as the 1980s &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; have given a rather glamorous image to gambling in Hong Kong. However, gambling is legal only at three established and licensed institutions approved and supervised by the government of Hong Kong: horse racing (in Happy Valley and Sha Tin), the Mark Six lottery, and recently, football (soccer) betting.

Games such as mahjong and many types of card games can be played for pleasure or with money at stake, with many mahjong parlours available. However, mahjong parlours are slowly diminishing as licences are no longer obtainable and, as a result, many old mahjong parlours have been forced to close.

====Gambling organisations====
The Hong Kong Jockey Club provides the only legal avenue for horse racing and gambling to locals, mostly middle-aged males. The club was established in 1844 by the British colonial government, with the first racecourse being built in Happy Valley. The club closed for a few years during World War II due to the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. In 1975, lottery Mark Six was introduced. And in 2002, the Club offered wagerings for football world championship games including the English FA Premier League and the World Cup.

==Martial arts==
Martial arts in Hong Kong is accepted as a form of entertainment or exercise. Tai chi is one of the most popular, especially among the elderly. Groups of people practice the style in parks early in the morning. Many forms of martial arts are also passed down from different generations of Cantonese ancestry. (Mainly Cantonese) Styles like praying mantis, snake fist, and crane are some of the most recognised. The atmosphere is also distinct as people practice outdoor in peaks next to ultra modern high rise buildings.

==Sports==

Despite limited land resources, Hong Kong continues to offer recreational and competitive sports. Locally, sports in Hong Kong is described as &quot;Club Life&quot;. Major multipurpose venues like Hong Kong Coliseum and regular citizen facilities like Macpherson Stadium are available. Internationally, Hong Kong has participated in Olympic Games, and numerous other Asian Games events.

==Video games==
Arcade games first appeared in Hong Kong in the late 1970s. Most games during the golden age of arcade video games were designed by Japanese companies such as Namco and Taito but licensed by American game developers such as Midway Games and Atari. The first game to center the Hong Kong market was &quot;Pong&quot; but the most popular were Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; (released in 1978, 1980 and 1983 respectively). The games were so popular Pac-Man was featured in the 1983 animated film version of the manhua &quot;Old Master Q, San-T&quot; In 1987 Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; enjoyed unprecedented success and unlicensed film adaptations and comics flooded the market, including one by Xu Jingcheng incorporating elements of Chinese martial arts. Similarly SNK&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; released in 1994 influenced youth fashion for years and at least 30 local &quot;kung fu comics&quot; were based on the game.

<text>Jiaxing (), alternately romanized as Kashing, is a prefecture-level city in northern Zhejiang province, China. Lying on the Grand Canal of China, Jiaxing borders Hangzhou to the southwest, Huzhou to the west, Shanghai to the northeast, and the province of Jiangsu to the north. As of the 2020 census, its population was 5,400,868 and its built-up (or metro) area made of 2 urban districts was home to 1,518,654 inhabitants.

==Administration==
Jiaxing is the birthplace of the Majiabang Culture in the Neolithic Age. The ancestors engaged in farming, animal husbandry, fishing and hunting 7,000 years ago.

The prefecture-level city of Jiaxing administers 7 county-level divisions, including 2 districts, 3 county-level cities and 2 counties.

These are further divided into 75 township-level divisions, including 60 towns, 2 townships and 13 subdistricts.

==History==

===Known as a county===
*210 BC: Qin Shi Huang changed the name of Jiaxing from Changshui District () to Youquan ().
*231: Wild rice () of Jiaxing informed Sun Quan of the Kingdom of Wu that there was a sign of auspice, so Sun changed Youchuan to Hexing District (). This why Jiaxing&#x27;s abbreviation is &quot;He&quot;. Sun also changed his era name to Jiahe () in the following year.
*January 242: Sun He was made the crown prince. Because of the naming taboo, Jiahe was changed to Jiaxing.

==Economy==

Industry is the main economic driver to the city&#x27;s economy, contributing 47% to its GDP in 2015. Jiaxing is also well known as the &#x27;hometown of silk&#x27;, hence it is a famous producer of textiles and woolens. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest exporters of leather goods. There are mechanical, chemical and electronic industries there.

Jiaxing is an important energy base in East China. Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, the first self-designed nuclear power station in China, and Fangjiashan Nuclear Power Plant (under construction) are located in Haiyan County.

===Jiaxing Export Processing Zone===

Established in 2003, Jiaxing Export Processing Zone is a state-level export processing zone approved by State Council. It has a built-up area of 2.98 km2. Its development goal is to become the export processing base for IT, IC, mechanical and electrical, electronics and other high-tech industries.

==Tourism==
South Lake, to the south-east of the old walled city, has been a popular tourist site for centuries. The Chinese Communist Party was officially founded on a boat in the lake, after the delegates to its first congress adjourned their meeting in Shanghai and reconvened here. As a result, the lake is now a popular destination for Communist Party &quot;education&quot; tours.

Within the city proper, the Zicheng (citadel) of Jiaxing was for two millennia the fortified nucleus of the walled city, though only fragmented remains now survive from the imperial era. The main gate was rebuilt in 1990. Jiaxing is one of the very few cities in south-east China that retains any vestige of a citadel. A number of famous writers&#x27; homes also survive in the old walled city, as well as a Carmelite abbey and Gothic abbey church built in 1902.

Meiwan Street and Yuehe Street (Zhongji Road and surrounds) are two restored neighbourhoods to the south and north of the old city respectively, located near the city moat, canals and lakes. Literally &quot;&quot;Prunus&quot; bay street&quot; and &quot;moon river street&quot; respectively, these two neighbourhoods combine restored historic buildings and newly landscaped gardens. Meiwan Street features buildings in the style of private residences of prominent families, and is the location of &quot;Kim Koo&#x27;s refuge&quot;, a house significant in the history of the Korean independence movement, and a family shrine of the Qian family, a prominent local family. By contrast, Yuehe Street features artisan workshops and street food stores. In January 2022, Yuehe Street was named the &quot;first provincial night cultural and tourist concentration area&quot;.

Wuzhen and Xitang, two townships within Jiaxing city limits, feature preserved and restored houses situated along small canals that are evocative of typical canal towns of the region. They are popular tourist destinations and filming locations.

==Transportation==

The city is served by two railway stations: Jiaxing railway station, on the Shanghai–Kunming railway, and Jiaxing South railway station on the high speed Shanghai–Hangzhou Passenger Railway. The city is served by two long-distance bus stations: Jiaxing North Bus Station and the new Jiaxing Transportation Center. Jiaxing is on the G92 Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway, G60 Shanghai–Kunming Expressway and China National Highway 320.

Jiaxing Air Base is being converted to a public-use airport.

==Language==

Jiaxing dialect is a Northern Wu dialect in the Sujiahu dialect grouping. As such, it is a sister dialect of both Shanghainese and Suzhou dialect, and easily intelligible with both. It is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin or other varieties of Chinese such as Cantonese, Hokkien or Hakka.

==Religion==
Local people believe in Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism and Protestantism. Jiaxing Catholic Church and Jiaxing Vincent Abbey are well-known Roman Catholic Churches in Jiaxing.

<text>The Bookman was a literary journal established in 1895 by Dodd, Mead and Company

Frank H. Dodd, head of Dodd, Mead and Company, established &quot;The Bookman&quot; in 1895. Its first editor was Harry Thurston Peck, who worked on its staff from 1895 to 1906. With the journal&#x27;s first issue in February 1895, Peck created America&#x27;s first bestseller list. The lists in &quot;The Bookman&quot; ran from 1895 until 1918, and is the only comprehensive source of annual bestsellers in the United States from 1895 to 1912, when &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; began publishing their own lists.

In the April 1895 edition, &quot;The Bookman&quot;&#x27;s editors explained the need for an American version of the already established London &quot;Bookman&quot;: &quot;&quot;The Bookman&quot; has been a great success since its first appearance in London in 1891, and it is believed that there is ample room and sufficient &quot;clientele&quot; among the great multitude of readers, for a literary journal of the same character in America. The American Edition will retain all of the popular features of the English &quot;Bookman&quot;, but it will be freshly edited and contain additional material of immediate importance to readers in the United States.&quot;

In 1918, the journal was bought by the George H. Doran Company and then sold in April 1927 to Burton Rascoe and Seward B. Collins. After Rascoe&#x27;s departure in April 1928, Collins continued to edit and publish the magazine until it ceased publication in 1933.

It was edited by Arthur Bartlett Maurice (1873–1946) from 1899 to 1916; by G.G. Wyant from 1916 to 1918; and by John C. Farrar during the years it was owned by George H. Doran. Only under the brief editorship of Burton Rascoe from 1927 to 1928 did it abandon its conservative standards and political stance, publishing, for example, Upton Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;Boston&quot;. Its last editor was Seward Collins, under whose editorship &quot;The Bookman&quot; carried articles conforming to his conservative views, influenced by Irving Babbitt, and promoted humanism and distributism. Collins himself was moving towards fascism during his years as editor. When &quot;The Bookman&quot; ceased publication in 1933, Collins launched &quot;The American Review&quot;.

<text>FightBox is a game show that aired on BBC Three from 13 October to 10 November 2003 and is hosted by Lisa Snowdon and Trevor Nelson with Paul Dickenson as commentator.

==Format==
Contestants design their fighters and submit them to the BBC. Out of hundreds of submissions, only sixty were chosen to appear on the programme.

As well as battling each other, the fighters would face one of six &quot;Sentients&quot;, warriors who had won previous (unseen) tournaments and achieved this honour. The Sentients were Banshi, Big George, Kodiak, Nail, Pearl and Vesuvius. Although immortal, they did have certain weaknesses which a fighter could use against them. After winning the first series, competitor warrior Kill Frenzy, created by Usman Arshad, achieved sentience and joined the current six. These seven Sentients featured in the video game mentioned below.

Six Games were played during the show these were: Conquest, Demolition, Duel, Helix, Panic and Revolution. Another game was Showdown, a straight one on one battle to determine the winner of each tournament.

==Production==
&quot;FightBox&quot; was shot using ten cameras in front of an audience of around 200 people. The show used &quot;FreeD&quot; virtual camera technology, which allowed the creation of realtime composite images.

Several video game companies were considered for the development of the show&#x27;s game engine, including Kuju and Warthog Games. Runecraft was eventually chosen for the job. During the airing of the show, Runecraft was shut down and to keep the show alive, BBC acquired the company and renamed it to Gamezlab, where it became part of BBC Multimedia. Gamezlab developed the video game adaptation for the PlayStation 2, PC and Game Boy Advance.

==Reception==
After three weeks, the show had an average audience of 22,000 viewers.

==Video Game==

Following the TV show&#x27;s conclusion, a video game adaptation for PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Advance was released in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2004.

<doc id="393288" wikidata="Q825765" url="?curid=393288" title="Tourism in Hong Kong">
<text>The tourism industry has been an important part of the economy of Hong Kong since it shifted to a service sector model in the late 1980s and early 90s. There has been a sharp increase of domestic tourists from Mainland China following the introduction of the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) in 2003.

== Background ==

The total tourism expenditure associated with inbound tourism reached 7,333 per capita in 2011. According to the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) Overall visitor arrivals to Hong Kong in 2010 totalled just over 36 million, a 21.8% increase over the previous year. The numbers included approximately 22.5 million mainland Chinese arrivals, 8.2 million short-haul (excluding Mainland) arrivals, and 4.8 million long-haul arrivals. In July 2011 more than 3.8 million visitors arrived in Hong Kong, equivalent to more than half of Hong Kong&#x27;s population and setting an outright record for a single month.

Along with the strong growth in the number of Mainland visitors, most other long and short-haul markets are also performing healthily with double-digit growth over 2006. Among long-haul markets, Europe, Africa and the Middle East took the lead with arrivals of 1,916,861, an 11.1% increase that made this Hong Kong&#x27;s best-performing market region in 2006.

While facing increasing competition from Mainland cities and Macau, the Hong Kong Tourism Board works closely with authorities and trade to make Hong Kong an essential component in all combo and multi-destination itineraries.

Tourism, along with international trade and financial services are the three main sources of income for Hong Kong. According to Hong Kong&#x27;s finance secretary, since the protests of 2019, tourism has plunged by 40% compared to 2018.

== Accommodation and length of stay ==
In December 2006, there were 612 hotels and tourist guest houses in Hong Kong, with 52,512 rooms. The average occupancy rate across all categories of hotels and tourist guesthouses was 87% for the whole of 2006, a one-percentage-point growth compared with 2005 despite the 7.4% increase in Hong Kong&#x27;s room supply between December 2005 and December 2006. During 2006, 62.7% of all visitors stayed one night or longer, which is a trend reflecting Hong Kong&#x27;s increasing importance as a regional transport hub.

== Tourism Commission ==
The Tourism Commission was established in May 1999 to promote Hong Kong as Asia&#x27;s premier international city for all visitors. A Tourism Strategy Group, comprising representatives from the Government, the HKTB and various sectors of the tourism industry has been established to advise the Government on tourism development from a strategic perspective.

== Top most visiting nationalities ==
Most visitors arriving to Hong Kong were from the following country or territory of residence:

== Attractions and facilities ==
The following locations are areas generally marked as main attractions.

=== Hong Kong Island ===
=== Kowloon ===
&quot;Including New Kowloon&quot;
=== New Territories ===
&quot;Including the Outlying Islands&quot;
=== Retail ===
Because Hong Kong benefits from favorable taxation rules, it is a favored location for tourists from elsewhere in China to purchase luxury goods like cosmetics, jewelry, and designer fashion goods.

==Tourism events==
Hong Kong has a number a events throughout the year that are aimed at attracting visitors. The authority claims that Hong Kong is an Events Capital of Asia.

===International Chinese New Year Night Parade===

First organised in 1996, the International Chinese New Year Night Parade is one of the most important celebratory events during Chinese New Year in Hong Kong. Originally it was held during day time on Hong Kong Island, and from 2004 onward the event has been held during night time in Tsim Sha Tsui.

Apart from the decorated floats, the parade also features local and international performance groups.

The 2018 parade attracted over 150,000 spectators, half of them were visitors.

== Accessing Hong Kong ==
To facilitate entry of visitors, various measures were introduced in 2002. The quota of the Hong Kong Tour Group Scheme of Mainland visitors has been abolished since January 2002. The number of Mainland travel agents authorized to organize such tours has also increased significantly. Nationals from some 170 countries can visit Hong Kong visa free for period from seven days to 180 days. The Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) was introduced on 28 July 2003. The Scheme has been gradually extended and now covers Guangdong province, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin and nine cities in Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In 2006, over 6.6 million Mainland citizens traveled to Hong Kong under the IVS, which is 20.2% more than 2005.

== Promotion ==
The HKTB continues to promote the destination to business and leisure travellers through its worldwide &quot;Hong Kong – Live it, Love it!&quot; campaign. Leveraging on the opening of several new attractions from 2005 onwards, the HKTB has designated 2006 as &quot;Discover Hong Kong Year&quot;. The global marketing campaign makes use of a series of strategic promotions to showcase the new image of Hong Kong and promote it as a &quot;must-visit&quot; destination in 2006. The HKTB began its travel trade promotion in May 2005 and rolled out the consumer promotions worldwide in late 2005. Aloagreement, a series of joint overseas marketing initiatives is being conducted with Macau and the nine provincial tourism bureaus concerned.

== Controversies ==
===Birth tourism in Hong Kong===

In the years up to till 2012, birth tourism in Hong Kong had been increasing. Pregnant mainland women seeking to give birth in Hong Kong, specifically to benefit from the right of abode. Their parents came from mainland to give birth in Hong Kong, which resulted in their children gaining the right to abode and enjoy social welfare in the city. Hong Kong citizens expressed concerns that the pregnant women and babies put heavier burden on Hong Kong&#x27;s medical system. Some of them even called mainland people &quot;locusts&quot; which take away Hong Kong&#x27;s resources from locals. Over 170,000 new births where both parents were mainland people between 2001 and 2011, of which 32,653 were born in 2010. CY Leung&#x27;s first public announcement on policy as Chief Executive-elect was to impose a &#x27;zero&#x27; quota on mainland mothers giving birth in Hong Kong. Leung further underlined that those who did may not be able to secure the right of abode for their offspring in Hong Kong.

===Parallel trading in Hong Kong===

Since 2012, there have been more mainland parallel traders coming to the northern parts of Hong Kong to import goods and export them back to mainland, which earns them some money for each transfer. Some products that are popular among these traders, such as infant formula, faced shortage in Hong Kong for an extended time as a result. This made the government impose restrictions on the amount of milk powder exports from Hong Kong. Besides, since northern places like Sheung Shui became the transaction centres of the traders, this resulted in discontent from nearby residents.

<doc id="393289" wikidata="Q107011665" url="?curid=393289" title="BBC Three">
<text>BBC Three is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the BBC. It was first launched on 9 February 2003 with programmes for a 16 to 34-year-old target audience. It covers all genres including particularly new comedies, drama, LGBTQ+ programmes, music, fashion, documentaries, brief news, adult animation, and drama series. The television channel closed down on 16 February 2016, and was replaced by an online-only streaming channel of the same name; BBC Three was relaunched as a linear television service on 1 February 2022. The channel broadcasts daily from 7:00 pm to 4:00 am, timesharing with CBBC (which starts at 7:00 am).

BBC Three is the BBC&#x27;s youth-orientated television channel, its remit to provide &quot;innovative programming&quot; to a target audience of viewers between 16 and 34 years old, leveraging technology as well as new talent. Unlike its commercial rivals, 90% of BBC Three&#x27;s output originated from the United Kingdom. Notable exceptions were &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;American Dad&quot; (both of them originating in the United States). It and sister channel BBC Four also carry occasional BBC Sport programming as an overflow for the BBC&#x27;s other channels.

Following budget cuts at the BBC, the first iteration of BBC Three ceased operations in February 2016, despite public opposition, moving to a BBC Three-branded streaming channel the next day on the iPlayer. It returned to broadcast television in the form of a late-night strand on BBC One on Monday to Wednesday nights since 4 March 2019. On 2 March 2021, the BBC confirmed that it planned to relaunch BBC Three&#x27;s linear television channel in 2022 subject to regulatory approval, which was approved in November that year.

==History==
===Original run===
In mid-2000, the BBC decided to reposition and rebrand their two digital channels so that they could be more closely linked to the well established BBC One and BBC Two. Their plan was for BBC Knowledge to be replaced with BBC Four (which took place in 2002) and for BBC Choice to be replaced with BBC Three. However, questions were raised over the proposed format of the new BBC Three, as some thought the new format would be too similar to the BBC&#x27;s commercial rivals, namely ITV2 &amp; E4 at the time. It would be unnecessary competition. Whilst BBC Four, the BBC&#x27;s proposed children&#x27;s channels and digital radio stations all received approval, the BBC Three plans were rejected in September 2001.

The channel was eventually given the go ahead, eleven months after the original launch date on 17 September 2002, following a change to the remit of the channel where a 15-minute news programme and an altered target age range of 25-34 audiences. BBC Three was launched on 9 February 2003. The channel was launched by Stuart Murphy, who previously ran BBC Choice, and before that UK Play, the now-discontinued UKTV music and comedy channel. At 33, Murphy was still the youngest channel controller in the country, a title he had held since launching UK Play at the age of 26; although on 20 October 2005 it was announced that Murphy was soon to leave the channel to work in commercial television.
On 12 May 2011, BBC Three was added to the Sky EPG in the Republic of Ireland on channel 229. It was later moved to channel 210 on 3 July 2012, to free up space for new channels.

For the duration of the 2012 Summer Olympics, BBC Three increased its broadcasting hours to 24 hours to provide extra coverage of Olympic events. Broadcast hours were extended again for the 2014 Commonwealth Games with BBC Three broadcasting from 9:00 am to 4:00 am for the duration of the games. On 16 July 2013 the BBC announced that a high-definition (HD) simulcast of BBC Three would be launched by early 2014. The channel launched on 10 December 2013.

The former controller of the station, Zai Bennett, left to join Sky Atlantic in July 2014, at which point BBC Three commissioner Sam Bickley became acting controller.

===Replacement by Internet service===

In February 2014, BBC Director-General Tony Hall announced that cuts of £100 million would have to be made at the corporation; Hall stated that the corporation could be forced to close one of its television services as a cost-savings measure. On 5 March 2014, Hall announced a proposal to convert BBC Three, discontinuing it as an &quot;open&quot; television service and turn it into an over-the-top Internet television service with a smaller programming budget and a focus on short-form productions. These changes formed part of a package of proposals from the BBC, including extending CBBC&#x27;s hours, reallocating £30 million on BBC One audiences for drama, and launching a one-hour timeshift channel of BBC One. There was notable backlash against the measures, with celebrities including Greg James, Matt Lucas and Jack Whitehall speaking out. A petition against the move on change.org has gathered over 300,000 signatures. However, there was some support from media commentators, and those who backed a &quot;slimmer&quot; BBC.

When the BBC revealed the full detail in December 2014, it admitted there was widespread opposition from BBC Three viewers but said there was support for the wider package of proposals. They believed the public welcomed a BBC One +1 as it admits &quot;a vast majority of viewing still takes place on linear channels&quot;. The &quot;Save BBC Three&#x27;&quot; campaign pointed out this was a contradiction to what the BBC said about BBC Three. The BBC Trust began a 28-day public consultation regarding the plans on 20 January 2015 and it ended with a protest outside Broadcasting House. As part of the consultation a letter of 750 names against the move from the creative industry was sent to the BBC Trust, and this had the backing of a number of celebrities including Daniel Radcliffe, Aidan Turner, Olivia Colman and Lena Headey. The polling company ICM concluded a &quot;large majority&quot; of those that replied to the consultation were against the move, with respondents particularly concerned about those who cannot stream programming online, the effect of the content budget cuts, and the BBC&#x27;s own admission the audience numbers would drop.

Despite significant public opposition, the proposal was provisionally approved by the BBC Trust in June 2015, and nonetheless the BBC Trust issued its final decision to approve the transition in November 2015, citing the fact that younger audiences have increasingly migrated to online television content as opposed to linear television channels, and the BBC&#x27;s ability to &quot;deliver more distinctive content online, while bearing down on costs&quot;. Conditions were imposed on other BBC properties to complement the changes; BBC One and Two will be required to develop &quot;distinctive programmes designed for younger audiences&quot;, as well as air encores of all full-length programmes that originally premiere on the BBC Three online service. The Trust also approved related proposals to allow first-run and third-party content on iPlayer, as well an extension to CBBC&#x27;s broadcast day to 9pm. The BBC One timeshift service was rejected, citing &quot;limited public value&quot;. Jimmy Mulville and Jon Thoday of independent production companies Hat Trick Productions and Avalon reportedly considered legal action against the Trust if it went ahead with the closure of the channel. They had previously offered to buy the channel to keep it on television, but the BBC said the channel was not up for sale.

BBC Three ended regular programming during the late evening in February 2016. Its final programme was an episode of &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, introduced by co-star James Corden from the Los Angeles studio of his U.S. talk show &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. The channel space carried promotional information regarding the BBC Three online service as well as limited programming until it officially shut down on 31 March.

From March 2019, programmes from the new service were carried by BBC One from Monday to Wednesday after the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; under the name &quot;BBC Three on BBC One&quot;.

=== Return to linear television ===
In May 2020, the BBC submitted its annual general plan for 2020–2021. It stated that the broadcaster was considering reinstating BBC Three as a linear channel with a doubled budget, citing that its content &quot;now has the potential to reach a wider audience on a linear channel, as well as the key demographic which will continue to watch online.&quot; A number of series carried by the service, including &quot;Fleabag&quot; and &quot;Normal People&quot;, had achieved strong critical acclaim, with &quot;Fleabag&quot; in particular winning multiple Primetime Emmy Awards.

On 2 March 2021, the BBC officially announced plans to reinstate BBC Three as a linear channel by January 2022, subject to approval by Ofcom. As before, it will timeshare with the CBBC channel and broadcast from 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. nightly. There will be pre-watershed programming targeting teenagers as part of the schedule.

On 16 September 2021, the UK media regulator Ofcom announced provisional approval for allowing BBC Three to return as a broadcast channel in 2022. As a public service channel it has the right to appear in the top 24 channels on EPGs. Sky complained that this would cause other channels to be bumped down the list to a less prominent position. On 25 November 2021, Ofcom announced it had given final approval for BBC Three to relaunch as a broadcast channel with a set period of February 2022, one month later than originally expected. A final logo of BBC Three as a streaming service was handled over the relaunched linear service; however, instead of pink, it uses a lime green colour.

On 5 January 2022, CBBC returned to its pre-2016 hours and BBC Three began test broadcasts on 10 January 2022 ahead of its relaunch on 1 February 2022. Following an introduction by Bimini Bon-Boulash, the relaunched channel&#x27;s first programme was &quot;The Launch Party,&quot; a preview special hosted by BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Clara Amfo and Greg James. This was followed by news programme &quot;The Catch Up&quot;, an &quot;Eating With My Ex&quot; celebrity special, and the premieres of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race: UK vs. the World&quot;, &quot;Lazy Susan&quot;, and the documentary &quot;Cherry Valentine: Gypsy Queen and Proud.&quot;

On 8 September 2022, BBC Three, Four, and one of the BBC Red Button channels were suspended due to the death of Elizabeth II, in order to preserve bandwidth for the broadcast of news coverage and tribute programming on BBC One and Two.

==BBC Three HD==
A high-definition version of BBC Three launched on 10 December 2013 along with high-definition versions of BBC Four, BBC News, CBBC and CBeebies.

Closed in 2016, BBC Three HD was relaunched in 2022 to coincide with the channel&#x27;s return to linear television. However, since the channel&#x27;s closure and eventual re-launch, its bandwidth had been reallocated in Scotland (to BBC Scotland HD) and Wales (to an HD simulcast of S4C). As a result, BBC Three HD is only available on Freeview in England and Northern Ireland. The SD variant is freely available in all regions and BBC Three HD is universally available on Sky, Freesat, cable and online via BBC iPlayer.

==Programming==
The channel&#x27;s target is 16–34-year-olds, and it faces heavy competition from rivals including ITV2 and E4, for an audience that the BBC has traditionally had difficulty in attracting. In 2008 it reached 26.3% of 16–34-year-olds in digital homes—the channel&#x27;s highest ever such reach and above that of E4, ITV2, Dave and Sky 1.

On average, nine million people watched BBC Three every week, and it had a 2.6% share of the 15–34-year-old audience and 1.4% of the whole population, according to the Broadcasters&#x27; Audience Research Board (BARB). These ratings by BARB, the official ratings agency, average out BBC Three&#x27;s viewing figures over a 24-hour period even though the channel only broadcasts in the evening, giving a distorted sense of the channel&#x27;s viewership. Despite several official complaints from the BBC, BARB continued to publish figures which the BBC argues are unrepresentative.

BBC Three&#x27;s programming consists of comedy, drama, spin-off series and repeated episodes of series from BBC One and BBC Two, and other programmes that attempted to alert others of their actions through a series of programmes challenging common beliefs.

An example of BBC Three&#x27;s comedy output includes the award-winning comedy &quot;Little Britain&quot;, which in October 2004 broke its previous viewing record when 1.8 million viewers tuned in for a new series. &quot;Little Britain&quot; was later broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s terrestrial analogue channels BBC One and BBC Two. The channel&#x27;s longest-running comedy programme is &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps&quot;, which ran for ten years, eight of which were on BBC Three (having previously aired on BBC Two and BBC Choice) and continues to be repeated on the channel every week. Some of the most popular comedy programmes on the channel in its original incarnation featured stand-up comedians performing their own take on a subject, usually the news, examples of which include &quot;Russell Howard&#x27;s Good News&quot; (which later transferred to BBC Two, partly due to its success, and partly to BBC Three&#x27;s move to online only) and &quot;Lee Nelson&#x27;s Well Good Show&quot;.

===Comedy and drama===
The channel airs various comedies and dramas; one of its most popular sitcoms is &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, which first aired in May 2007 and was written by and starred James Corden and Ruth Jones. The sitcom was an instant hit, with subsequent series being moved to other BBC channels and the show being granted a Christmas special. Another example is &quot;Being Human&quot;, a drama in which a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf share a flat, which has become a success and heralded several new series. American programming also features, with &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; being the notable examples.

Numerous popular series were either repeated on the channel or have spin-offs created from them. In early 2003, viewers could watch episodes of popular BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; on BBC Three before they were broadcast on BBC One. This programming decision coincided with the relaunch of the channel and helped it break the one million viewers milestone for the first time. An episode of &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot;, which was commissioned for BBC Three and looking behind the scenes of the programme, attracted 611,000 viewers. In 2005, BBC Three commissioned the documentary series &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, which was shown immediately after episodes of the new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had been screened on BBC One. This was followed up in July 2005, when it began to screen repeats of both programmes.

In October 2005, it was announced that BBC Three had commissioned a spin-off drama series from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, designed as a post-watershed science fiction drama for a more adult audience. &quot;Torchwood&quot; launched with 2.4 million viewers in October 2006. &quot;Torchwood&quot; is the first science fiction programme ever to have been commissioned by the channel, and its popularity led to it being broadcast on BBC Two for the second series, and on BBC One for subsequent series. In 2010, BBC Three began airing episodes of the fifth series of BBC drama series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; after they had aired on BBC One as part of its &#x27;catch-up&#x27; programming. From January 2015, BBC Three aired the remaining episodes of &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; before being repeated on BBC One later the same day.

Among its original programming, the channel also gave viewers the comedy drama &quot;Pramface&quot;, which was written by Chris Reddy and comprised 19 episodes over three series, broadcast between 2012 and 2014.

===Documentaries===
BBC Three also aired several youth-focused documentaries, including the BAFTA-winning &quot;Our War&quot;, &quot;Blood, Sweat and T-shirts&quot; (as well as its subsequent sequels), &quot;Life &amp; Death Row&quot; and a season of films focused on mental illness. BBC Three also aired specialist factual documentaries, such as &quot;How Drugs Work&quot; and &quot;How Sex Works.&quot;

Stacey Dooley, since her appearance on &quot;Blood, Sweat and T-shirts&quot; in 2008, presented documentaries including &quot;Stacey Dooley in the USA&quot; (2012–14), &quot;Coming Here Soon&quot; (2012), &quot;The Natives: This is our America&quot; (2017), &quot;Beaten by My Boyfriend&quot; (2015), &quot;Stacey Dooley in Cologne: The Blame Game&quot; (2016), &quot;Sex in Strange Places&quot; (2016), &quot;Stacey Dooley: Hate and Pride in Orlando&quot; (2016), &quot;Stacey Dooley on the Frontline: Girls, Guns and Isis&quot; (2016), &quot;Brainwashing Stacey&quot; (2016), &quot;Stacey Dooley: Face to Face with Isis&quot; (2018), and several other titles under the umbrella title &quot;Stacey Dooley Investigates&quot; (2009–present).

BBC Three also commissions a number of one-off documentaries, including &quot;Growing Up Down&#x27;s&quot; (2014), &quot;My Brother the Islamist&quot; (2011), &quot;Small Teen Big World&quot; (2010); &quot;Stormchaser: The Butterfly and the Tornado&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Autistic Me&quot; (2009). Many were commissioned through BBC Three&#x27;s FRESH scheme which provided an opportunity for &#x27;the next generation of directors&#x27; to make their first 60-minute documentaries for the channel.

In July 2022, a number of documentaries from the regional &quot;We Are England&quot; strand (featuring celebrities such as Bimini, Jayde Adams and Jassa Ahluwalia) were repeated on BBC Three, alongside a number of similarly formatted 30 minute documentaries, now made to get a premiere showing on BBC Three. However, rather than being grouped under a master brand, like BBC One&#x27;s &quot;We Are England&quot; or &quot;Our Lives&quot; programmes, these new documentaries are now just being listed under one off titles such as &quot;Filthy Business&quot; and &quot;Queen of Trucks&quot; on the BBC iPlayer and in programme guides.

===News and sport===
In its original incarnation, BBC Three featured &quot;60 Seconds&quot;, an hourly summary of news, sport and entertainment headlines. They were presented in a relaxed style in keeping with the rest of the channel. As part of the BBC&#x27;s discussions with the government regarding the founding of the channel, a longer news programme had been promised to provide a daily section of news and current affairs. &quot;The News Show&quot;, as it came to be called upon launch, was a &quot;Newsbeat&quot;-style fifteen-minute bulletin, later rebranded and reformatted as the more satirical and frivolous half hour &quot;The 7 O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. However, the BBC discontinued the bulletin in December 2005, following a recommendation made in the 2004 Barwise Report, which found that the channel&#x27;s target audience sought news from elsewhere. Upon the 2022 relaunch of BBC Three, a new summary of news, sport and entertainment was launched under the name &quot;The Catch Up&quot;. This programme is also broadcast on the BBC News channel.

The channel has also shown sports programming. &quot;Match of the Day Live&quot; broadcast international football matches featuring Wales, often when an England match was being shown on BBC One. The channel also showed some matches of England&#x27;s Women&#x27;s team. The 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 Africa Cup of Nations tournaments were shown on the channel, while it is scheduled to air the semi-finals and final of the 2021 edition.

In 2022, The channel along with BBC Four was suspended, following the death of her majesty Queen Elizabeth II. This was done, so that the bandwidth could be used on BBC One and Two for the tribute progammes.

=== Most watched programmes ===
The following is a list of the ten most watched broadcasts on BBC3 since launch, based on Live +7 data supplied by BARB. Number of viewers does not include repeats.
==Presentation==

The channel&#x27;s original idents were conceived by Stefan Marjoram at Aardman Animations and were used from launch until February 2008. Stuart Murphy was touring Aardman Animations looking for new programming ideas for BBC Three when he spotted the cone shaped creatures, he then took the idea back to the Lambie-Nairn agency, responsible for the BBC Three identity package. A feature of this identity is also the music &quot;Three Is The Magic Number&quot;, based (only the lyrics are copied) upon &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;.

BBC Online provided a number of downloads and activities based on the channel&#x27;s identity, these included &quot;BlobMate&quot;, screensavers, wallpapers and also games such as &quot;BlobLander&quot; and &quot;BlobBert&quot;. The idea used by both Lambie-Nairn, who had developed the branding for CBeebies and CBBC, and Aardman, was to create the BBC Three blobs as a relation to the green and yellow blobs of the children&#x27;s channels. Kieron Elliott, Dean Lydiate, Duncan Newmarch, Lola Buckley, Gavin Inskip and Jen Long provided out-of-vision continuity.

On 22 January 2008 a new channel identity was unveiled, which went to air on 12 February. Rebranding was carried out by Red Bee Media, along with agencies MPG and Agency Republic with music and sound design by creative audio company Koink.

In October 2013, BBC Three introduced a new series of idents with a theme of &quot;discovery&quot;. Designed by Claire Powell at Red Bee Media, the idents utilised projection mapping effects. The soundtrack for the idents was composed by Chris Branch and Tom Haines at Brains &amp; Hunch.

On 4 January 2016, alongside the announcement of the date for BBC Three&#x27;s relaunch as an online-only service, a third logo was unveiled. Inspired by the iconography of mobile applications, the new logo incorporated the Roman numeral for the number 3, with the third bar replaced by an exclamation mark. Marketing head Nikki Carr explained that the three bars represented the three principles of BBC Three as a service; making viewers &quot;think&quot;, &quot;laugh&quot;, and have a voice.

The &quot;tricon&quot; was used as the service&#x27;s primary logo until 2020, when a more conventional logo box was adopted—connecting and modifying the &quot;T&quot; and &quot;H&quot; in &quot;Three&quot; to resemble the tricon emblem. In October 2021, this wordmark was replaced with one in the BBC&#x27;s corporate font &quot;Reith Sans&quot; as part of a larger rebranding of the BBC&#x27;s television channels. The tricon remained in use as a secondary logo, such as in an ident used to present BBC Three programmes on BBC One after the rebrand.

The rebrand in 2021 proved to be short-lived, as with the service&#x27;s linear relaunch in February 2022, BBC Three adopted a new identity developed by Superunion and BBC Creative, with idents featuring three animated, pink and purple-coloured hands named &quot;Captain&quot;, &quot;Spider&quot;, and &quot;Pointer&quot; interacting in a lime green backdrop. The channel&#x27;s presentation features the hands &quot;irreverently [observing] what&#x27;s going on in popular culture and young people&#x27;s lives&quot;.

==Awards==
The channel has had critical and popular successes. Most recently, it won &quot;Broadcast Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Digital Channel of the Year&quot; Award for Best General Entertainment Channel, and MGEITF Non Terrestrial Channel of the Year.

It won more awards in its eleven-year broadcast history than its commercial rivals (Sky 1, Sky Living, E4, ITV2, Channel 5 and Comedy Central) have won in their combined 25-year history. In total BBC Three has won 7 BAFTA awards, 5 British Comedy Awards, 15 Royal Television Society Awards and 5 Rose d&#x27;Or Awards since the channel was launched in February 2003.

In 2008, BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; won the BAFTA audience award and the best comedy performance award was awarded to James Corden for his part.

==Criticism==
The channel came in for criticism from several corners, the most prominent of which came from some of the BBC&#x27;s long-standing presenters. These included John Humphrys, who argued that BBC Three and BBC Four should be shut down in the face of budget cuts to BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today programme&quot;, which he presents, as well as Jeremy Paxman.

In July 2010 a UK music magazine printed a letter from the pressure group Friends of Radio 3 that criticised BBC Three for having &#x27;comedies, game shows, films and documentaries, but no arts programming at all&#x27;. In a later issue another correspondent endorsed this assessment on the basis of a search through issues of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, and cast doubt on the BBC&#x27;s claim (in the document &quot;Performance Against Public Commitments 2009/10&quot;) that the channel broadcast &#x27;54 hours of new music and arts programming&#x27; in that year. Two months later the same correspondent wrote in to inform readers that the BBC had refused his &#x27;Freedom of Information&#x27; request concerning the titles of the programmes used in calculating the &#x27;54 hours&#x27; total.

<text>Black Boy (1945) is a memoir by American author Richard Wright, detailing his upbringing. Wright describes his youth in the South: Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee, and his eventual move to Chicago, where he establishes his writing career and becomes involved with the Communist Party. &quot;Black Boy&quot; gained high acclaim in the United States because of Wright&#x27;s honest and profound depiction of racism in America. While the book gained significant recognition, much of the reception throughout and after the publication process was highly controversial.

== Background ==
Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Black Boy&quot; was written in 1943 and published two years later (1945) in the early years of his career. Wright wrote &quot;Black Boy&quot; as a response to the experiences he had growing up. Given that &quot;Black Boy&quot; is partially autobiographical, many of the anecdotes stem from real experiences throughout Wright&#x27;s childhood. Richard Wright&#x27;s family spent much of their lives in deep poverty, enduring hunger and illness, and frequently moving around the South, and finally north, in search of a better life. Wright cites his family and childhood environment as the primary influence in his writing of the book. Specifically, Wright&#x27;s family&#x27;s strong religious beliefs imposed on him throughout his childhood shaped his view of religion. Similarly, the considerable distress—physical, mental, and emotional—that Wright experienced while growing up hungry is documented throughout much of &quot;Black Boy&quot;. 

Most generally, Wright credits the public influence of &quot;Black Boy&quot; to his description of the racial inequalities he was subjected to throughout his travels in America. Wright recognized the power of reading and writing to stimulate &quot;new ways of looking and seeing&quot; at a young age. When he was seventeen, he left Jackson to find work in Memphis where he became heavily involved in literary groups and publications and expanded on his use of words as the weapon &quot;to tell, to march, to fight, to create a sense of hunger for the life that gnaws in us&quot; that is seen in &quot;Black Boy&quot;. Wright claims that he chose to write about the experiences referenced in &quot;Black Boy&quot; in an effort to &quot;look squarely at his life, to build a bridge of words between him and the world&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Black Boy (American Hunger)&quot; is an autobiography following Richard Wright&#x27;s childhood and young adulthood. It is split into two sections, &quot;Southern Night&quot; (concerning his childhood in the south) and &quot;The Horror and the Glory&quot; (concerning his early adult years in Chicago).

=== &quot;Southern Night&quot; ===
The book begins with a mischievous four-year-old Wright setting fire to his grandmother&#x27;s house. Wright is a curious child living in a household of strict, religious women and violent, irresponsible men. After his father deserts his family, young Wright is shuffled back and forth between his sick mother, his fanatically religious grandmother, and various maternal aunts, uncles and orphanages attempting to take him in. Despite the efforts of various people and groups to take Wright in, he essentially raises himself with no central home. He quickly chafes against his surroundings, reading instead of playing with other children, and rejecting the church in favor of agnosticism at a young age. Throughout his mischief and hardship, Wright gets involved in fighting and drinking before the age of six. When Wright turns eleven, he begins taking jobs and is quickly introduced to the racism that constitutes much of his future. He continues to feel more out of place as he grows older and comes in contact with the Jim Crow racism of the 1920s South. He finds these circumstances generally unjust and fights attempts to quell his intellectual curiosity and potential as he dreams of moving north and becoming a writer.

=== &quot;The Horror and the Glory&quot; ===
In an effort to achieve his dreams of moving north, Wright reluctantly steals and lies until he attains enough money for a ticket to Memphis. Wright&#x27;s aspirations of escaping racism in his move North are quickly disillusioned as he encounters similar prejudices and oppressions amidst the people in Memphis, prompting him to continue his journeys towards Chicago.

The youth finds the North less racist than the South and begins understanding American race relations more deeply. He holds many jobs, most of them consisting of menial tasks: he washes floors during the day and reads Proust and medical journals at night. At this time, his family is still suffering in poverty, his mother is disabled by a stroke, and his relatives constantly interrogate him about his atheism and &quot;pointless&quot; reading. He finds a job at the post office, where he meets white men who share his cynical view of the world and religion. They invite him to the John Reed Club, an organization that promotes the arts and social change. He becomes involved with a magazine called &quot;Left Front&quot; and slowly immerses himself in the writers and artists in the Communist Party.

At first, Wright thinks he will find friends within the party, especially among its black members, but he finds them to be just as timid to change as the southern whites he left behind. The Communists fear those who disagree with their ideas and quickly brand Wright as a &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; for his tendency to question and speak his mind. When Richard tries to leave the party, he is accused of trying to lead others away from it.

After witnessing the trial of another black Communist for counter-revolutionary activity, Wright decides to abandon the party. He remains branded an &quot;enemy&quot; of Communism, and party members threaten him away from various jobs and gatherings. He does not fight them because he believes they are clumsily groping toward ideas that he agrees with: unity, tolerance, and equality. Wright ends the book by resolving to use his writing as a way to start a revolution: asserting that everyone has a &quot;hunger&quot; for life that needs to be filled. For Wright, writing is his way to the human heart, and therefore, the closest cure to his hunger.

== Genre and style ==
The genre of Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Black Boy&quot; is a longstanding controversy due to the ambiguity. &quot;Black Boy&quot; follows Wright&#x27;s childhood with a degree of accuracy that suggests it exists as an autobiography, although Wright never confirmed nor denied whether the book was entirely autobiographical or fictitious. None of Wright&#x27;s other books follow the truths of his life in the way &quot;Black Boy&quot; does. The book&#x27;s apparent tendency to intermix fact and fiction is criticized because of the specific dialogue that suggests a degree of fiction. Additionally, Wright omits certain details of his family&#x27;s background that would typically be included in an autobiographical novel. While Wright may have deviated from historical truths, the book is accurate in the sense that he rarely deviates from narrative truth in the candidness and rawness of his writing.

The style in &quot;Black Boy&quot; is so highly regarded because of the frankness that defied social demands at the time of &quot;Black Boy’s&quot; publication. Wright negates the racially based oppression he endured through his ability to read and write with eloquence and credibility as well as with his courage to speak back against the dominant norms of society that are holding him back.

== Analysis ==
Given &quot;Black Boy’s&quot; emphasis on racial inequality in America, many of the motifs refer to the lingering aspects of slave narratives in present day. These motifs include violence, religion, starvation, familial unity and lack thereof, literacy, and the North Star as a guide towards freedom. The depictions of lingering racial animosity are at the core of the arguments in favor of censorship for many critics. The prevalence of violence amidst and against Blacks in America ties back to the violence exerted upon slaves generations before. The theme of violence intermixes with the notion of race as Wright suggests that violence is deeply entrenched into a system where people are distinguished based on their race. Regardless of Wright&#x27;s efforts to break free from this violent lifestyle, a society based on differences will always feed on an inescapable discourse. 

Wright&#x27;s skeptical view of Christianity mirrors the religious presence for many slaves. Throughout &quot;Black Boy&quot;, this skepticism of religion is present as Richard regards Christianity as being primarily based on a general inclusion in a group rather than incorporating any meaningful, spiritual connection to God. The general state of poverty and hunger that Wright endures reflects, to a lesser degree, similar obstacles that slaves faced. Wright&#x27;s portrayal of hunger goes beyond a lack of food to represent a metaphorical kind of hunger in his yearning for a better, freer life. In his search for a better life in the North, Richard is seeking to fulfill both his physical and metaphorical hungers for more. The cyclical portrayal of poverty in &quot;Black Boy&quot; represents society as a personified enemy that crushes dreams for those who aren&#x27;t in command of high society. 

The strong attempt at maintaining family unity also relates to the efforts amidst slaves to remain connected through such immense hardship. Wright&#x27;s longing to journey North in search of improvement embodies the slaves longing to follow the North Star on the freedom trains in search of freedom. Despite the harsh reality upon arrival, throughout &quot;Black Boy&quot;, the North is represented as a land of opportunity and freedom. Lastly, Wright&#x27;s focus on literacy as a weapon towards personal freedom also reflects the efforts of many slaves hoping to free themselves through the ability to read and write. The emphasis on literacy complicates the notion of finding freedom from a physical space to a mental power attained through education.

The most general impact of &quot;Black Boy&quot; is shown through Wright&#x27;s efforts to bring light to the complexities of race relations in America, both the seen and unseen. Given the oppression and lacking education for blacks in America, the raw honesty of their hardships was rarely heard and even more rarely given literary attention, making the impact of &quot;Black Boy’s&quot; narrative especially influential. The book works to show the underlying inequalities that Wright faced daily in America.

In June 1944, the Book of the Month Club expressed an interest in only &quot;Part One: Southern Night.&quot; In response, Wright agreed to eliminate the Chicago section, and in August, he renamed the shortened book as &quot;Black Boy.&quot; &quot;Harper and Brothers&quot; published it under that title in 1945 and it sold 195,000 retail copies in its first edition and 351,000 copies through the Book-of-the-Month Club.

Parts of the Chicago chapters were published during Wright&#x27;s lifetime as magazine articles, but the six chapters were not published together until 1977, by &quot;Harper and Row&quot; as &quot;American Hunger.&quot; In 1991, the Library of America published all 20 chapters, as Wright had originally intended, under the title &quot;Black Boy (American Hunger)&quot; as part of their volume of Wright&#x27;s &quot;Later Works&quot;.

The Book-of-the-Month-Club played an important role in Wright&#x27;s career. It selected his 1940 novel, &quot;Native Son,&quot; as the first Book of the Month Club written by a black American. Wright was willing to change his &quot;Black Boy&quot; book to get a second endorsement. However, he wrote in his journal that the Book-of-the-Month-Club had yielded to pressure from the Communist Party in asking him to eliminate the chapters that dealt with his membership in and disillusionment with the Communist Party. In order for Wright to get his memoir really &quot;noticed&quot; by the general public, his publisher required that he divide the portions of his book into two sections.

== Reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;Black Boy&quot; gained significant traction—both positive and negative—from readers and critics alike. In February 1945, &quot;Black Boy&quot; was a Book-of-the-Month-Club selection, bringing it immediate fame and acclaim. &quot;Black Boy&quot; was also featured in a list compiled by the Lending Section of the American Library Association labeled &quot;50 Outstanding Books of 1945&quot;. The list, which was compiled by numerous individuals and institutions, acclaims &quot;Black Boy&quot; as &quot;the author&#x27;s account of his boyhood [that] is a grim record of frustration, race tension, and suffering&quot;. From 1996 to 2000, the Round Rock Independent School District board in Texas voted 4–2 against a proposal to remove Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Black Boy&quot; from reading lists at local schools, eventually deciding the content of the book was worthy and necessary in schools. In numerous cases of attempted censorship for &quot;Black Boy&quot;, Richard Wright&#x27;s widow, Ellen Wright, stood up and publicly defended the book, claiming that the censorship of &quot;Black Boy&quot; would be &quot;tantamount to an American tragedy&quot;. &quot;Black Boy&quot; was most recently challenged in Michigan in 2007 by the Howell High School for distributing explicit materials to minors, a ruling that was quickly overruled by a prosecutor who found that &quot;the explicit passages illustrated a larger literary, artistic, or political message&quot;.

&quot;Black Boy&quot; has come under fire by numerous states, institutions, and individuals alike. Most petitioners of the book criticize Wright for being anti-American, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, overly sexual and obscene, and most commonly, for portraying a grim picture of race relations in America. On 1945, Theodore G. Bilbo denounced this book on the floor of the Senate, describing this book as &quot;obsene&quot; and aiming to excite Blacks against Whites, closing his statement with a &quot;but it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type.&quot; In 1972, &quot;Black Boy&quot; was banned in Michigan schools after parents found the content to be overly sexual and generally unsuitable for teens. In 1975, the book was challenged in both Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Tennessee, both places claiming the book was obscene and instigated racial tension. &quot;Black Boy&quot; was first challenged in New York in 1976 by the board of education of the Island Trees Free School District in New York. It was soon the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1982. Petitioners against the inclusion of &quot;Black Boy&quot; described the autobiography as &quot;objectionable&quot; and &quot;improper fare for school students.&quot; The book was later challenged in Lincoln, Nebraska on accounts of its &quot;corruptive, obscene nature&quot;. In May 1997, the President of the North Florida Ministerial Alliance condemned the inclusion of &quot;Black Boy&quot; in Jacksonville&#x27;s public schools, claiming the content is not &quot;right for high school students&quot; due to profanity and racial references.

According to the American Library Association, &quot;Black Boy&quot; was the 81st most banned and challenged book in the United States between 2000 and 2009.

<text>CBeebies is a British free-to-air public broadcast children&#x27;s television channel owned and operated by the BBC. It is also the brand used for all BBC content targeted for children aged six years and under. Its sister channel, CBBC, is intended for older children aged six to twelve. It broadcasts every day from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, timesharing with BBC Four.

==History==

On 20 November 2001, the CBeebies name was officially revealed as part of the split of the already-existing CBBC block and would be used as both a children&#x27;s block and a digital channel.

The CBeebies channel launched on 11 February 2002 alongside the CBBC channel, as a spinoff from the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s television strand. The first four shows to air on the channel were &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, &quot;Binka&quot;, &quot;Step Inside&quot; and &quot;Bits and Bobs&quot;. CBeebies domestically broadcasts from 5:30 am to 7:00 pm, broadcasting seven days per week. From the launch of the channel until 1 March 2002, CBeebies timeshared with fellow BBC channel BBC Knowledge but since 2 March 2002, it now timeshares with BBC Four, which is on air after CBeebies closes for the night at 7:00 pm.

CBeebies was joined in March 2007 by its own radio station, aptly named &quot;CBeebies Radio&quot;, which broadcast for three hours each day on BBC Radio 7 until April 2011. CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on CBeebies&#x27; website since 2013, and as a station on BBC Sounds broadcasting from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm. A &quot;CBeebies Weekly&quot; magazine, now named just &quot;CBeebies Magazine&quot;, was first published in 2006.

Since March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the British Forces Broadcasting Service. CBeebies is also available in Ireland.

In September 2018 as part of a branding strategy, BBC Alba&#x27;s unbranded two-hour children&#x27;s block was split into CBeebies Alba and CBBC Alba, with the former airing during the first hour and the latter airing during the second hour. This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows in Scottish Gaelic. The only presenter shared between the CBeebies Alba block and CBeebies channel is Dodge T. Dog, who appears on an occasional basis.

On 15 March 2023, CBeebies rebranded its channel identity, in line with a wider corporate rebranding across the BBC starting in 2021. This was CBeebies&#x27; first rebrand, retiring the logo that the channel had used since its launch 21 years earlier. The new style featured a new logo in line with the BBC&#x27;s 2021 logo, as well as a revamped appearance of the &quot;Bugbie&quot; characters that had been part of the channel&#x27;s identity since launch.

==International and non-English versions==

BBC Studios owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule (compared to the UK version).

The first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was shut down at the end of November 2012 due to &quot;commercial considerations&quot;. The Polish CBeebies channel was launched on 2 December 2007, while feeds in Latin America, East, Southeast Asia, South Africa and Australia were launched in late 2008. In March 2011, an on demand version of the network was launched in the United States and is available on Xfinity.

On 13 May 2011, CBeebies was launched as a programme block on the channel BBC Kids in Canada, available on weekdays between 9:00 am and 3:00 pm. It served a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to Knowledge Kids.

In April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster KBS and Japanese broadcaster Kids Station to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.

In April 2016, a channel for the MENA region was launched.

On 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing BBC Entertainment. CBeebies Asia has already launched in Hong Kong, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Maldives, Macau, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. On 13 April 2017, the localised CBeebies feed for Latin America ceased operations along with BBC Earth and BBC Entertainment.

On 5 April 2018, a feed was launched on Digiturk in Turkey.

On 1 December 2019, the Australian feed launched in New Zealand on Sky.

In March 2020, CBeebies launched on Vietnam&#x27;s television provider Msky.

In July 2020, it was relaunched in India, but with pan-Asian feed in English audio track only.

On 31 October 2020, CBeebies and CBeebies en Español were removed from all cable and satellite providers in the United States.

On 11 January 2022, BBC Kids launched as a FAST channel on Pluto TV in the United States, which airs select CBeebies and CBBC shows from the BBC Studios catalogue. A version of the channel that airs Spanish-dubbed programming titled &quot;Niños por BBC&quot; was launched on the same day. Both channels have since been removed. BBC Kids continues to be available on Samsung TV Plus in the United States.

On 15 December 2022, the Asian feed of CBeebies was launched as a preview channel on Astro, which replaced Boomerang on 1 February 2023.

A planned rebrand for the Polish version of CBeebies was cancelled in March 2024 after the departure of presenter Aneta Piotrowska.

It was announced that CBeebies on Foxtel in Australia would be removed on 31 July 2024, alongside BBC First, BBC Earth, BBC News, and A&amp;E. However, 3 months after the Foxtel shutdown, CBeebies and BBC Kids were removed from Fetch TV on 31 October 2024, marking CBeebies to cease operations in Australia after nearly 16 years.

==Management==
In the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children&#x27;s and Education division and part of BBC North. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC&#x27;s domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children&#x27;s and Education, Patricia Hildago Reina (since 2020). The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with Kay Benbow, the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV and radio. She took over from the first controller Michael Carrington in 2010. In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post would close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children&#x27;s role entitled Head of Content. In January 2021 it was announced that the decision would be reversed, and a new Head of Commissioning and Acquisitions for preschoolers (0–6) would be appointed.

Internationally, CBeebies is owned by BBC Studios, which operate the brand.

==Presentation==
The links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of in-vision continuity, using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel CBBC. They were originally recorded from studio TC0 at BBC Television Centre in London, but moved out in 2008 to Teddington Studios, and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011 onwards, the links have been based at the BBC&#x27;s northern base at studios HQ5 and HQ6 in Dock10 studios at MediaCityUK following the move of the BBC Children&#x27;s department there.

As is with the rest of the BBC&#x27;s channels, there is a lack of advertisements and programmes are occasionally broken up by trailers for new shows, new seasons of said shows or events.

===Logo and identities===

CBeebies uses many identities throughout the day during the breaks in between shows. Most of these idents feature the mascots, named the Bugs, also known as the Bugbies. The Bugbies are yellow blobs with faces, and are similar to the ones used by CBBC between 2002 and 2005, with the only difference being the colour: green for CBBC and yellow for CBeebies with both using purple as a similarity. Most idents before the late 2010&#x27;s feature children saying the channel name twice once the logo appears except the Bedtime idents. The idents have used a moving blobby, slimy-like background or rounded shapes in any colour. Each block has its own ident, and the Bedtime Hour has a few different idents. In 2016, new idents were made for each block, replacing the old ones and the slimy moving background idents were rarely shown. Idents featuring the CBeebies House with it changing to effect the current season have been used from 2016 to 2023.

On 15 March 2023, CBeebies underwent a rebranding by Blue Zoo to fully-adopt the BBC&#x27;s new corporate branding, with the Bugs reimagined in a rounded square-shaped form to evoke the BBC logo, and a new suite of idents and animated scenes incorporating two- and three-dimensional elements.

==Programming==
==Presenters==

Live presenters have been on CBeebies since the channel&#x27;s launch. They are used to fill the gaps between the shows that air on the channel, speaking directly to the child, doing certain activities such as arts and crafts, leading activities based on a topic from the website, showing viewers&#x27; birthday cards, and introducing the shows, well as hosting some of the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters in other services or on children&#x27;s programmes.

===International Presenters===
The international variants feature different personalities per broadcast region.
* The Australian feed is the only non-UK service to feature more than one presenter, as this feed features three presenters. Tara Colegrave has presented since the channel&#x27;s launch in 2008 and when the continuity links moved from the UK to Australia, she was joined by Robbie Harding and Duncan Fellows in 2011.
* The Asian feed shown in countries like Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore has Nisha Anil as the main presenter.
* The now-defunct Latin American feed variant had Roser Cabañas as the presenter.
* The Polish channel had Aneta Piotrowska as main presenter from its launch in 2008 until 2024. On some occasions between November 2014 to 2016 Aneta appeared on the UK channel.
* The South African feed uses former UK presenter Sid Sloane. Cat Sandion also presented on this feed before becoming a presenter on the UK version.
* The CBeebies Alba block on BBC Alba uses Bard Cornark, Ben Cajee and Carrie Macneil as the presenters.
* The Turkish feed uses the UK presenters (e.g., Cat Sandion and George Webster) dubbed over with Turkish voice actors.

===Storytimes===
While the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters at about 1:00 with an often repeated story, the final show of each day, known as CBeebies Bedtime Stories (known as &quot;Stòiridh&quot; in Scottish Gaelic and airing on BBC Alba) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, athletes, singers/musicians and past presenters of BBC children&#x27;s television, including David Walliams, Tom Hardy, Ed Sheeran, Steve Carell, Billie Eilish, Ryan Reynolds, Paloma Faith and Jack Black.

==CBeebies HD==
The channel launched on 10 December 2013, though was rolled-out nationwide up to June 2014 (as did BBC News HD, CBBC HD and BBC Four HD). The channel broadcasts on a commercially operated HD multiplex on Freeview, with limited geographic coverage compared with other multiplexes, and shares its stream with BBC Four HD as they air at different times. Prior to launch, the majority of CBeebies&#x27; HD output was broadcast on BBC HD before its closure on 26 March 2013.

==Other ventures==
===CBeebies website===

The CBeebies website coincided with the launch of the UK channel in February 2002 and showcases a child friendly site with activities themed to various CBeebies programmes, past and present, with games, songs and print-outs featuring for nearly all the shows. The UK version also features links to CBeebies iPlayer, a child friendly version of the BBC iPlayer site or app featuring CBeebies programmes only, to CBeebies radio player and a dedicated micro site containing advice for raising children and toddlers called CBeebies Grown-ups, which was relaunched in 2011.

The international channels and associated websites are run by BBC Studios. As a result, not all of them are the same and some channels have less extensive websites than other services. CBeebies channels in Asia, Australia, Poland, South Africa and the USA all have their own international variant.

===VHS and DVD releases===
BBC Video (and later 2Entertain) have released several VHS/DVD compilations featuring shows airing on CBeebies at the time. As of 2014, Abbey Home Media releases the compilations.
===Album releases===
Five CBeebies-branded CDs have been released, &#x27;CBeebies: The Official Album&#x27; in 2002, &#x27;My CBeebies Album&#x27; in 2006, &#x27;My CBeebies Album (Christmas Edition)&#x27; in 2007, &#x27;CBeebies: Song Time&#x27; in 2010, and &#x27;CBeebies: The Album&#x27; in 2012.

===CBeebies Land===
CBeebies Land opened in May 2014. Designed as a retheme of the previous Storybook Land and Old McDonald&#x27;s Farmyard areas of the Alton Towers theme park, it contains a range of themed rides, attractions and live entertainment based around various popular CBeebies programmes. It offers various indoor and outdoor activities aimed at making an immersive and interactive world for children and young families.

The site based within Alton Towers Resort in Staffordshire includes some of the more popular characters from the original channel for guests to meet. Described as a &#x27;fun environment for pre-schoolers to play and learn&#x27; by critics. Before CBeebies Land, Alton Towers did not have enough rides suitable for young children and since opening, CBeebies Land now makes visiting the amusement park exciting for younger children.

At the start of the year, the theme park sporadically released information on the characters involved in the development via their Facebook and Twitter accounts.
* On 4 January, Mr Tumble was the first character confirmed – featuring in the Something Special Sensory Garden and 5 January saw Mr. Bloom confirmed as featuring in the development in the form of Mr Bloom&#x27;s Allotments.
* On 6 January, the park revealed an In the Night Garden... redesign of their existing Riverbank Eyespy. It features many characters from the show, like Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka.

The fourth reveal on 7 January was that of Nina and the Neurons It was an interactive science lab.

The latest additions to CBeebies Land were in Spring 2022. In December 2021, it was confirmed that Alton Towers were adding three new attractions to CBeebies Land, there was Hey Duggee: The Big Adventure Badge which had replaced Tree Fu Tom Training Camp, Andy&#x27;s Adventures Dinosaur Dig which replaced Mr Bloom&#x27;s Alloment and JoJo and GranGran at Home which replaced Charlie and Lola&#x27;s Moonsquirters &amp; Green drops.

==Awards==
The UK channel and the programmes it has broadcast have received a number of awards throughout the years. In 2002, the CBeebies Interactive TV Services were nominated in the Best Interactive Service category and CBeebies Online was nominated in the same category in 2005 at the BAFTA Children&#x27;s Awards. The channel was awarded Best Children&#x27;s Channel and Highly Commended at the Broadcast Digital Channel Awards 2006, however only achieved a nomination in 2007 and 2008. The channel was also named Children&#x27;s Channel of the Year at the BAFTA Children&#x27;s awards in 2006, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018 and 2019 and was nominated for Channel of the Year in 2008.

The CBeebies UK website was nominated Best Interactive Site at the 2007 BAFTA Children&#x27;s awards, and the brand as a whole also won the Best Design and Innovation award by the Royal Television Society, whose awarding panel said &quot;Its website is an integral part of the brand, with its TV production and online teams working together to create innovative game play and immersive web experiences.&quot;

<text>Ricky Wilde (born Ricki Steven Reginald Smith, 6 November 1961, sometimes credited as Ricki Wilde) is a British songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is the younger brother of singer Kim Wilde; their father is singer-actor Marty Wilde.

==Career==

At the age of eleven, Wilde was signed by record producer Jonathan King to King&#x27;s UK Records label, and released his first single in November 1972, called &quot;I Am an Astronaut&quot;. King became his mentor and had great faith in Wilde and groomed him for stardom as the teenybopper star of 1973. The children&#x27;s magazine Look-in featured Wilde and Donny Osmond on the cover in June 1973 with the headline &quot;Is Ricky Wilde the new Donny?&quot;. Subsequent singles were &quot;Do It Again, a Little Bit Slower&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Go to a Disco&quot; and &quot;Teen Wave&quot;.  However, the singles were not successful in the UK, although he was featured in youth magazines at the time and appeared with his father alongside eleven years old pop rival Darren Burn in BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Man Alive&quot; documentary film &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;, made in July 1973.  He had some hits in Scandinavia and Spain at the time.

Recordings of new material in 1980 led to the &#x27;discovery&#x27; of his sister Kim. Ricky&#x27;s new role was that of producer and co-writer, a role he has fulfilled up until now. By his own admission, he was happy to be more in the background as of that moment.  After Kim Wilde paused her career in pop music, Ricky Wilde continued to work in the music industry. In 2005 he was one of the initiators of the band, Sonic Hub, and of the record label Sonic Hub Records.

He co-directed the film &quot;Shoot The DJ&quot;, released in 2010.

&quot;I Am an Astronaut&quot; was covered by Snow Patrol for the Save the Children compilation album &quot;Colours Are Brighter&quot;; it also featured as a B-side to their single &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. It was translated into Swedish, and recorded by nine-year-old Linus Wahlgren in 1985. The Swedish version was later covered by Wahlgren&#x27;s nephew Benjamin Ingrosso in 2007, also at nine years of age.  Ricky started a podcast with famous blogger Lee Bennett and Eastenders soap star Jake Wood called &#x27;Unsung Heroes&#x27;, talking to songwriters and producers behind the scenes in the music industry.

===Influences===
Wilde has named Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) as &quot;heroes&quot; and a key source of inspiration. Other influences have included Ultravox, John Foxx, Gary Numan, Skids, Sex Pistols, the Clash, Kraftwerk and the Stranglers.

== Discography ==

Wilde has writing and production credits on Kim Wilde albums.

<text>The Alsos Mission was an organized effort by a team of British and United States military, scientific, and intelligence personnel to discover enemy scientific developments during World War II. Its chief focus to investigate the progress that Nazi Germany was making in the area of nuclear technology, and to seize any German nuclear resources that would either be of use to the Manhattan Project or worth denying to the Soviet Union. It also investigated German chemical and biological weapon development and the means to deliver them, and any other advanced Axis technology it was able to get information about in the course of the other investigations (such as the V-2 rocket program).

The Alsos Mission was created after the September 1943 Allied invasion of Italy as part of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s mission to coordinate foreign intelligence related to enemy nuclear activity. The team had a twofold assignment: search for personnel, records, material, and sites to evaluate the above programs and prevent their capture by the Soviet Union. Alsos personnel followed close behind the front lines in Italy, France, and Germany, occasionally crossing into enemy-held territory to secure valuable resources before they could be destroyed or scientists escape or fall into rival hands.

The Alsos Mission was commanded by Colonel Boris Pash, a former Manhattan Project security officer, with Samuel Goudsmit as chief scientific advisor. It was jointly staffed by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the Manhattan Project, and Army Intelligence (G-2), with field assistance from combat engineers assigned to specific task forces.

Alsos teams were successful in locating and removing a substantial portion of the German research effort&#x27;s surviving records and equipment. They also took most of the senior German research personnel into custody, including Otto Hahn, Max von Laue, Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. By November-December 1944, they had concluded that there was no threat of a German atomic bomb, and that the German nuclear program had only reached an experimental phase, not a production phase. After the defeat of Japan, an Alsos mission was sent in to evaluate its nuclear program as well.

==Origin==
The Manhattan Project was the Allied nuclear weapons research-and-development program, operated during and immediately after World War II, led by the United States with contributions principally from the United Kingdom and Canada. Brigadier General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became its director in September 1942. The project operated under a tight blanket of security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, particularly Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or to undertake covert operations against the project.

Allied work on nuclear fission had been motivated by scientists, many of whom were refugees from Nazi Germany, who feared a German atomic bomb program was underway. The discovery of fission had taken place largely in Otto Hahn&#x27;s Berlin laboratory, and many scientists in the United States held the work of German scientists, especially Werner Heisenberg, in high regard. Fear that they were in a &quot;race&quot; for the atomic bomb was one of the main reasons for the establishment of the Manhattan Project and acceleration of the Allied effort. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German nuclear activity were taken seriously. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.

Following the September 1943 Allied invasion of Italy, Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, Chief of Staff of Army Service Forces, was concerned that intelligence activities related to foreign nuclear energy programs were not being properly coordinated. He feared that important items might be overlooked unless those responsible were properly briefed, yet at the same time wished to minimize the number of personnel with access to such secret information. Having the Manhattan Project itself take over responsibility for coordinating these efforts would address both these concerns. Accordingly, he approached Groves on behalf of General George Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army, with that recommendation.

In response, Groves created the &quot;Alsos Mission&quot;, a small team jointly staffed by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the Manhattan Project, and Army Intelligence (G-2). Its assignment was to investigate enemy scientific developments, including nuclear weapons research. Groves was not pleased with the codename (derived from , the Greek word for &quot;&quot;), but decided that changing it would only draw unwanted attention.

The Chief of Army Intelligence, Major General George V. Strong, appointed Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to command the unit. Pash had served as the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, where he had investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. Pash&#x27;s command comprised his executive officer Captain Wayne B. Stanard, four Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) agents, four interpreters, and four scientists: Dr. James B. Fisk from the Bell Telephone Company, Dr. John R. Johnson from Cornell University, Commander Bruce Old from the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Major William Allis, originally from MIT although then serving on the War Department scientific staff.

The Manhattan Project intelligence staff believed that the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan&#x27;s capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified to work in the area.

==Italy==
In December 1943, the Alsos Mission reached Algiers, where Pash reported to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ), Major General Walter B. Smith, and his British Chief of Intelligence, Brigadier Kenneth Strong. This was awkward as Pash&#x27;s instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission, but it turned out that Strong was already fully aware of it. It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong&#x27;s American deputy, Colonel Thomas E. Roderick. The Alsos Mission then moved on to Italy, where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce&#x27;s Allied Control Commission. Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio, the man who had negotiated Italy&#x27;s surrender to the Allies, and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government, who gave him a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities.

Alsos interviewed the Italian Minister for Communications, the Chief of Naval Ordnance, the staff of the Italian Naval Academy, and Italian scientists at the University of Naples, and examined what captured technical documents could be found. There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith&#x27;s S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome on the heels of the advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.

Rome fell on 4 June 1944. When the news came that its fall was imminent, Pash was ordered from London to Italy. He flew back to Italy and entered the city with S-Force on 5 June. Pash took key scientists into custody and arranged for sites targeted by Alsos, including the University of Rome and the &quot;Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche&quot;, to be secured. The Alsos Mission to Italy was reconstituted under the command of Pash&#x27;s deputy, Major Richard C. Ham, and Johnson and Major Robert R. Furman were sent from the United States to join him. They reached Rome on 19 June, and over the next weeks interviewed scientists including Edoardo Amaldi, Gian-Carlo Wick, and Francesco Giordani. The picture that the Alsos Mission built up indicated that the German effort was not far advanced.

==Western Europe==
===Britain===
In December 1943, Groves sent Furman to Britain to discuss the establishment of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project with the British government, and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort. Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh, the head of the Norwegian Section of MI6, was unimpressed with Furman&#x27;s grasp of the subject matter. Groves selected the head of the Manhattan District&#x27;s security activities, Captain Horace K. Calvert, as head of the London Liaison Office, with the title of Assistant Military Attaché. Working in cooperation with Welsh and Michael Perrin from Tube Alloys, the London Liaison Office consisted of Calvert, Captain George B. Davis, two Women&#x27;s Army Corps clerks and three CIC agents.
The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee scientists and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German scientists of interest and possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities, and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium was available in Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by assessing the size of the piles of tailings.

Groves warned General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the possibility that the Germans might disrupt the Normandy landings with radioactive poisons, and sent Major Arthur V. Peterson to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter B. Smith. Under the codename Operation Peppermint, special equipment was prepared and Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use. The British forces made similar preparations for their beaches. The precautions were unnecessary.

Meanwhile, the new head of G-2, Major General Clayton L. Bissell, at the urging of Groves and Furman, decided to create a new, even larger Alsos Mission for western Europe in March 1944. Pash assumed command of the new unit upon its official creation by the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, on 4 April. The military staff for the new mission were selected by Bissell on Pash&#x27;s advice. Lieutenant Colonel George R. Eckman became the deputy commander. Captain Henry A. Schade was appointed as the head of the naval contingent. Groves and Vannevar Bush, the head of OSRD, selected the scientific staff, and appointed Samuel Goudsmit, a University of Michigan physicist with a good command of several western European languages, as its head. Goudsmit had not been working on the Manhattan Project, and therefore could not reveal any of its secrets if captured. The British considered creating their own rival mission, but in the end agreed to participate as a junior partner. Three Dutch and one Norwegian officer also served with the Alsos Mission. By the end of August it had seven officers and 33 scientists.

===France===
On 5 August, Pash received a secret message from Washington, D.C., reporting that the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie had been sighted at his holiday home at L&#x27;Arcouest in Brittany. Joliot-Curie was at the top of Alsos&#x27;s wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate in the wake of the advancing U.S. Third Army. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L&#x27;Arcouest area. Pash and Beatson got there the morning of 17 August with Task Force A, and they were directed to Joliot-Curie&#x27;s house, which had been emptied by the Germans. They searched the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 21 August.
The rest of the advance party of the Alsos Mission moved to Normandy in August 1944, where it joined T-Force, a similar formation to S-Force, at Rambouillet, where it was preparing for the liberation of Paris. An Alsos Mission team including Pash and Calvert reached Joliot-Curie&#x27;s house in the Paris suburbs on 24 August to find that he was not there, but at his laboratory at the Collège de France. The next day they reached the Porte d&#x27;Orléans where they encountered troops of the French &quot;2e Division Blindée&quot;, who were engaged in liberating the city, and came under small arms fire from the German defenders. The Alsos Mission replied with their M1 carbines and Thompson submachine guns as they made their way through the back streets to the college, where they found Joliot-Curie in his office.

Goudsmit interviewed Joliot-Curie in Paris on 27 August. Accompanied by Calvert, Joliot-Curie was flown to London where Perrin and Goudsmit interviewed him about the activities of German scientists. Joliot-Curie recalled visits to the College, which had a cyclotron, by German scientists including Erich Schumann, who had initiated the German nuclear project, and controlled it until it had been handed over to the &quot;Reichsforschungsrat&quot; (National Research Council) in 1942; by Abraham Esau, who had been in charge of nuclear physics under the &quot;Reichsforschungsrat&quot;; and by Walter Gerlach, who had replaced him in January 1944. Other German physicists who had used the facilities included Kurt Diebner, Walther Bothe, and Erich Bagge, all of whom were known to be associated with the German nuclear project.

Meanwhile, T-Force had moved into the Petit Palais. The main body of the Alsos Mission soon followed, and the Mission opened an office at the Place de l&#x27;Opéra. On 5 September, word was received that the British 21st Army Group was about to enter Brussels. There were two important Alsos Mission objectives in Belgium: the corporate headquarters of Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the world&#x27;s largest supplier of uranium ore, in Antwerp, and its uranium processing plant in Olen. A six-man Alsos Mission team set out to secure them, led by Pash and the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, at ETOUSA, Colonel G. Bryan Conrad.

On reaching Brussels, they made contact with Lieutenant Colonel David Strangeways, the commander of R Force, who provided them with an escort of Royal Air Force armored vehicles. They entered Antwerp on 7 September and found the office of Union Minière. They discovered that over 1,000 tons of refined uranium had been sent to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen. They set out for Olen, where they located 68 tons, but another 80 tons were missing, having been shipped to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium. The capture of Eindhoven by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division allowed early access to another high priority target, the Philips plant there. Brigadier Edgar Williams, the 21st Army Group&#x27;s Chief of Intelligence, facilitated the Alsos Mission&#x27;s detour to Eindhoven, where it was able to interview Dutch scientists. Williams also furnished a detachment of Royal Engineers to transport and move the uranium from Olen. Groves had it shipped to England, and, ultimately, to the United States.
The Alsos Mission now attempted to recover the shipment that had been sent to France. Documentation was discovered that said that part of it had been sent to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash&#x27;s command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that had been sent to Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.

Information gathered in Rennes, Paris, and Eindhoven pointed to Strasbourg as a place of particular interest. Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known to be working at the University of Strasbourg, as was , an expert on viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission&#x27;s Biological Warfare section. The Naval section was interested in the torpedo research being carried out there, and jet engine development was being undertaken at Strasbourg&#x27;s Junkers plant.

On 22 November, the U.S. Sixth Army Group notified the Alsos Mission that the capture of Strasbourg was imminent, and it should join T-Force in Saarburg, where it was preparing to enter the city. The Alsos Mission joined T-Force in Strasbourg on 25 November. The German nuclear laboratory was discovered on the grounds of the Strasbourg Hospital, where the physicists attempted to pass themselves off as medics. Fleischmann was taken into custody, but Weizsäcker and Haagen had fled the city.

Documents discovered in Weizsäcker&#x27;s office, Fleischmann&#x27;s laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities taking place at Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in Haagen&#x27;s office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the Germans had been unable to develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For the first time the Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that a German nuclear weapon was not a threat, as it had never gotten to a production phase. As Goudsmit put it later: &quot;The conclusions were unmistakable. The evidence at hand proved definitely that Germany had no atom bomb and was not likely to have one in any reasonable time.&quot;

===Germany===

When the German Operation Nordwind offensive threatened Strasbourg, Pash ordered all captured documents to be removed. Papers indicating the nature of the Alsos Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the Alsos Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered an evacuation plan to be prepared for the Alsos Mission&#x27;s main headquarters in Paris. The embarrassing series of intelligence failures that had led up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the Alsos Mission&#x27;s own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm that it was not a small nuclear explosion.

Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945, but all signs pointed to the lack of a production program. On March 16, Groves wrote to Bissell that &quot;the most complete and factual information we have obtained bearing on the nature of the German effort in our field&quot;— the results of the Strasbourg mission — &quot;tends to confirm our conclusion that the Germans are now behind us.&quot;
A new forward headquarters, Alsos Forward North (AFwdN), was opened at Aachen, and on 8 February the Alsos Mission reopened its forward headquarters in Strasbourg as Alsos Forward South (AFwdS). In March, the U.S. Twelfth Army Group launched Operation Lumberjack, an offensive to clear the Germans west of the Rhine. Pash, who was promoted to colonel on 6 March, led an Alsos Mission detachment into Cologne on 7 March, but little additional information was found.

The interrogation of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in Germany, mostly at the &quot;Auergesellschaft&quot; plant at Oranienburg, so Groves arranged for the plant to be bombed on 15 March 1945. Some 612 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Eighth Air Force dropped 1,500 tons of high explosive and 178 tons of incendiary bombs on the plant.

On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where important scientists were captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn was at his laboratory in Tailfingen, while Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg&#x27;s laboratory in Hechingen, and the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg&#x27;s team had built in Berlin had been moved to Haigerloch. Henceforth, the main focus of the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the Württemberg area. 

In April 1945 a four-man team under Hugh Montgomery uncovered the Buchenwald concentration camp and broke secrecy protocol to request medical help. The team was searching for a German nuclear physicist near Weimar, eastern Germany. 
As the Allied armies advanced into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, where they found documentation concerning the German nuclear program, components of a nuclear reactor, and eight tons of uranium oxide. Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, the chief of the planning board of the &quot;Reichsforschungsrat&quot;, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental centrifuge for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.

The problem with the targets in the Württemberg area was that they not only lay in the path of the French First Army&#x27;s advance, but were also in the occupation zone allocated to France. Groves attempted to get the occupation boundaries changed, but the State Department wanted to know why first, and Groves refused to provide this information. Groves, Marshall, and Stimson then decided that the area would have to be secured by American troops that would carry off what they could and destroy everything else. Pash was sent to ask General Jacob Devers, the commander of the U.S. Sixth Army Group, if the zones of the French First Army and the U.S. Seventh Army could be swapped around. He was informed that the matter would have to be taken up with Eisenhower.

Groves dispatched Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr. to Europe, where he participated in a meeting with Lieutenant General Bedell Smith and Major General Harold Bull of SHAEF; Major General Elbridge Chapman, the commander of the U.S. 13th Airborne Division; Pash, Furman, and Goudsmit of Alsos; and Brigadier General Reuben E. Jenkins from the Sixth Army Group. The plan, codenamed Operation Effective, called for the 13th Airborne Division to occupy the area to prevent its capture by the French, and seize an airfield that could be used to fly in an Alsos Mission team, and later to fly it out, along with captured German scientists. Operation Effective was scheduled for 22 April. Meanwhile, Devers took steps to delay the French advance.
The Alsos Mission had learned that the uranium ores that had been taken from Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the &quot;Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft&quot; (WiFO) plant in Staßfurt. The 83rd Infantry Division captured this on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, Perrin and Air Commodore Sir Charles Hambro, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferrouranium weighing about 1,000 tons, were taken away by an African-American truck company. The uranium was taken to Hildesheim and most of it was flown to the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force; the rest had to be moved to Antwerp by train and loaded onto a ship to England.

On 20 April, the French First Army captured an intact bridge over the Neckar River at Horb and established a bridgehead. It was decided to send in a force on the ground instead of Operation Effective, which was cancelled on 19 April. This time, instead of following or accompanying the front-line troops, the Alsos Mission would operate behind enemy lines. The Alsos Mission had taken delivery of two armored cars, four jeeps with machine gun mounts, and two .50 caliber machine guns. The other two jeeps would carry captured German machine guns. They would be accompanied by three unarmed jeeps. For the operation, codenamed Operation Big, Pash would command a special force called Task Force A, built around his Alsos Mission team and the U.S. 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Wilbur White, less its Company B. Sir Charles Hambro decided to accompany the Alsos Mission with a British group that included Michael Perrin, David Gattiker, Eric Welsh, and Rupert Cecil. Lansdale accompanied Task Force A as Groves&#x27; representative, and Brigadier General Eugene L. Harrison, the G-2 from the Sixth Army Group, as Devers&#x27; representative.

The Alsos Mission set out on 20 April and rendezvoused with the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion at Freudenstadt. The intact bridge over the Neckar River at Horb was crossed and Haigerloch was occupied without opposition on 22 April. The main body of Task Force A arrived on 23 April. In a laboratory in a cellar they found a German experimental nuclear reactor shaped like a cylinder and made of graphite blocks, but the uranium and heavy water were missing. The scientists immediately began dismantling it. Pash left Hambro in charge, while he led troops of Task Force A to Bisingen, and then on to Hechingen, where 25 scientists were captured, including Weizsäcker, Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge. At Tailfingen they took Otto Hahn and nine members of his staff into custody. At Haigerloch, a sealed drum of documents was retrieved from a cesspool, and three drums of heavy water and 1.5 tons of uranium ingots were found buried in a field. The uranium and heavy water were loaded onto trucks. The apertures in the cellar were blown up with minor explosions to prevent their capture by the French.

Werner Heisenberg, &quot;Germany&#x27;s Oppenheimer&quot; according to Gregg Herken, remained at large, having left Hechingen on 19 April. On 1 May, Pash set out in pursuit of Heisenberg with ten men in the two armored cars and two jeeps. They teamed up with the 36th Reconnaissance Troop of the U.S. 36th Infantry Division and entered Urfeld on 2 May, where Pash found Heisenberg at his home. The Americans became involved in firefights with German troops attempting to enter the town, and the 36th Reconnaissance Troop had to head off on another mission, leaving Pash with just seven men. Fortunately, the German force, which numbered about 700, offered to surrender. Pash returned on 3 May with the 3rd Battalion, 142nd Infantry, which took them prisoner, while Pash and his Alsos Mission team took Heisenberg into custody.

By VE day, the Alsos Mission had a strength of 114 men and women. It was officially disbanded on 15 October 1945.

===Operation Epsilon===

German scientists that had been captured by the Alsos Mission were held in several camps, separate from other prisoners of war. After VE Day, SHAEF decided to concentrate them in an internment camp at Kransberg Castle, codenamed &quot;Dustbin&quot;, as part of Operation Epsilon. At Welsh&#x27;s instigation, ten of the nuclear physicists, Bagge, Diebner, Gerlach, Hahn, Harteck, Heisenberg, Korsching, von Laue, von Weizsäcker and Wirtz, were brought to England. They were accommodated between 3 July 1945 and 3 January 1946 at Farm Hall, a house in Godmanchester, near Cambridge. The premises were thoroughly bugged to determine how close the German nuclear project had been to constructing an atomic bomb by listening in to their conversations and transcripts of their conversations were sent to Groves. The most interesting conversations occurred after they received the news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when they struggled to comprehend how the Allies had done what they could not.

==Japan==
Plans for the invasion of Japan incorporated an Alsos Mission. Japanese fire balloon attacks on the United States had aroused fears that the technique might be used in combination with biological agents, which the Japanese Unit 731 was known to be experimenting with. In March 1945, the physicist and seismologist L. Don Leet was appointed as head of the scientific section of the Alsos Mission to Japan. Leet had previously worked with the Manhattan Project on the Trinity nuclear test. Plans were drawn up to prepare and equip a T-Force along the lines of the one in Europe, but made up of personnel already in the Pacific. The mission differed from its European counterpart in that it was solely American and consisted of only one intelligence agency. Responsibility for nuclear matters was subsequently handled by a separate Manhattan Project Intelligence Group organized by Groves.

Leet&#x27;s group reached Manila in July 1945, where they met with the intelligence staff of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s Army Forces, Pacific. Following the surrender of Japan the mission traveled to Japan and visited various research establishments including Tokyo Imperial University, Waseda University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, the Institute for Materials Research, Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Toshiba), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the National Research Council, and the Board of Technology. The mission, which included Karl Compton, interviewed over 300 Japanese scientists and produced reports on Japanese research into radar, rockets, and other developments, including chemical and biological warfare. The Manhattan Project Intelligence Group, under the command of Philip Morrison, arrived in Japan in September 1945 and examined Japan&#x27;s wartime nuclear weapons program. The group concluded that lack of uranium ore and low priority had doomed the Japanese effort. They reported that, contrary to American belief, Japan&#x27;s nuclear physicists were competent.

==Legacy==
After seeing the German project at Haigerloch, Goudsmit wrote that:

In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed little to the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and biological weapons programs that it had been formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies&#x27; own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.

<text>The Vapors are an English new wave and power pop band that initially existed between 1978 and 1981. They had a hit with the song &quot;Turning Japanese&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980 and No. 36 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Career==
===1978–1982===
Based in Guildford, Surrey, an early version of the group were playing at The Three Lions pub in Farncombe when The Jam&#x27;s bassist Bruce Foxton spotted them. The group&#x27;s line-up stabilised with David Fenton (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Howard Smith (drums), Edward Bazalgette (lead guitar) and Steve Smith (bass). Howard Smith and Steve Smith were not related. The group were originally named The Vapours but had removed the &quot;u&quot; to help garner more attention in America. Foxton then offered the group a few gigs and agreed to jointly-manage them with John Weller (father of Paul Weller). The Vapors were then offered a slot supporting The Jam on the Setting Sons tour in 1979.

The group signed to United Artists, releasing their first single, &quot;Prisoners&quot;, at the end of 1979, but it failed to chart. Their second single, &quot;Turning Japanese&quot;, is the song for which they are best remembered. The track was produced by The Jam&#x27;s producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven and reached number 3 in the UK and number 1 in Australia. It was also a top-ten hit in Canada and New Zealand and reached the top 40 in the United States. &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; was believed to euphemistically refer to masturbation, although Fenton (the song&#x27;s writer) denied that claim in an interview on VH1. He did, however, say he wished to thank whoever first came up with that interpretation, as he felt the salacious rumour about what the song &#x27;really&#x27; meant may have been what made it a hit. The follow-up singles &quot;News at Ten&quot; and &quot;Jimmie Jones&quot; both peaked at number 44 in the UK Singles Chart.

The group released two albums; &quot;New Clear Days&quot; (1980) and &quot;Magnets&quot; (1981). &quot;New Clear Days&quot; contained &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; and displayed a new wave sound with socially-conscious lyrics. That album reached the middle of the charts in the UK, Canada, and US. &quot;Magnets&quot; revealed a power pop sound and darker lyrics, with the song &quot;Jimmie Jones&quot; making reference to cult leader Jim Jones. That album sold poorly and the band broke up in 1982. Fenton alleged in a later interview with &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine that lack of record label support was the chief reason for the band&#x27;s split, while a planned single release was cancelled without explanation.

After the Vapors broke up, David Fenton joined the legal profession in the early 1990s, concentrating on the legal aspects of the music industry, and from 1999 he worked as a London-based in-house solicitor for the Musicians&#x27; Union. Edward Bazalgette became a television director; his credits include a 2005 BBC documentary about Genghis Khan and two episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2015. For many years Howard Smith ran an independent record shop, People Records in Guildford, the band&#x27;s home town. Steve Smith formed the band Shoot!Dispute, which appeared in John Peel sessions, and toured in support of Bruce Foxton; and later joined the rap/rock band 1ST.

===2016–present===
After 34 years of inactivity, David Fenton, Ed Bazalgette, and Steve Smith appeared on stage at the Half Moon in Putney on 30 April 2016. With a guest drummer standing in for Howard Smith, they played &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; and then left the stage. Rumors of a reunion were rife, and the Vapors completed a four-date tour in October–November 2016 with Michael Bowes on drums. The Vapors continued with six more concerts in 2017 and 10 in 2018. That included three dates in New York City with David Fenton&#x27;s son, Danny Fenton, standing in for Ed Bazelgette on lead guitar, where they played several new tracks, including &quot;Sundown River&quot;, &quot;Letter to Hiro (No11)&quot;, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, &quot;One of My Dreams&quot;, and &quot;King L&quot;.

As of 2017, the band&#x27;s catalogue masters are controlled by Razor &amp; Tie Industries, which acquired them from Warner Music Group, whose Alternative Distribution Alliance serves as RT Industries&#x27; worldwide distributor when RT was newly launched in 2018. On 21 April 2018, they re-released &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; on red vinyl with bonus tracks for Record Store Day.

In April 2019, the band was announced as the support to From the Jam on the 30-date Setting Sons 40th Anniversary tour. The Vapors had been the opening act for The Jam on the original 1979 Setting Sons tour.

On 3 March 2020, the Vapors announced that they would be releasing a new album, &quot;Together&quot;, and issued &quot;Crazy&quot; as its lead single. &quot;Together&quot; was released on 15 May. It was the first album from the Vapors in 39 years, marking one of the longest gaps between studio albums.

On 30 August, &quot;Girl from the Factory&quot;, the third single from the album, reached number one on the United DJs &quot;Heritage Chart&quot;. Follow-up single &quot;Wonderland&quot; also reached the top of the Heritage Charts on 22 November.

The band celebrated their top-selling album by going out on the New Clear Days 40th Anniversary Tour in 2021. The download-only singles &quot;One of My Dreams Came True&quot; (2021), &quot;Novocaine&quot; (2022), and &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; (2024) all reached the Heritage Chart top ten, maintaining the band profile.

On 2 September 2022 the band returned to their Guildford roots to play at the town&#x27;s Suburbs Holroyd Arms 

In January 2023, a US show was announced: the band played at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on 20 May 2023.

In August 2024, the band announced plans to crowdfund the production of their fourth album, to be released in March of 2025.

<text>Hong Kong Park is a public park next to Cotton Tree Drive in Central, Hong Kong. Built at a cost of HK$398 million and opened on 23 May 1991, it covers an area of and is an example of modern design and facilities blending with natural landscape.

==History==

Part of the site was known as Cantonment Hill in early colonial days in 1841. At the upper part of the former location of the Victoria Barracks, built between 1867 and 1910, the barracks were handed to the government in 1979. Glenealy Junior School occupied part of this site up until 1988. After the school vacated the site, the area was turned into the present park. Hong Kong Park was officially opened on 23 May 1991 by Sir David Wilson, the Governor of Hong Kong at that time. It covers an area of 8 hectares and is an outstanding example of modern design and facilities blending with the natural landscape.

The construction of the park was a joint project by the Urban Council (dissolved in 1999) and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club (renamed the Hong Kong Jockey Club in 1996).

==Historic buildings==

* Flagstaff House (1846), since 1984 housing the Flagstaff House Museum of Teaware

A few historic buildings of former Victoria Barracks were also conserved in the park, including:
* Cassels Block (early 20th century), former barracks for married British officers. Now housing the Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre since 1992
* Rawlinson House (early 20th century), former house of the British Deputy General, converted in the 1980s into Cotton Tree Drive Marriage Registry and the office of the park.
* Wavell House (early 20th century), former quarters for married British officers, converted in 1991 into the aviary support centre (Education Centre).

These historic buildings are graded as Grade II Historic Buildings.

The park can be easily reached by walking through the Pacific Place and its nearby escalator.

==Facilities==
Hong Kong Park captures the natural landscape in the busy and crowded business centre. Its main feature is Edward Youde Aviary which is Hong Kong&#x27;s largest aviary while the Vantage Point is another great place to see the &quot;bird exhibition&quot;. There is also a greenhouse (Forsgate Conservatory) which holds &quot;plant exhibition&quot; such as &quot;Orchid Exhibition&quot; temporarily. There are also many modern gardens, including Garden Plaza and tai chi Garden. To suit the sport-lovers, a sport centre and a squash centre were also built in Hong Kong Park.

==Awards==
* The design of the park won Honour Award for Urban Design (1998) of Hong Kong Chapter, the American Institute of Architects.
* The park was awarded as one of the Top Ten Buildings of the 90s by a building journal in March 2000.

<text>Flagstaff House, built in 1846, is the oldest example of Western-style architecture remaining in Hong Kong. It is located at 10 Cotton Tree Drive, Central – within the Hong Kong Park.

It has been a longtime residence of the Commander of the British forces in Hong Kong during colonial times. Today Flagstaff House houses the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware.

==History==

Flagstaff House had been named as Headquarter House until 1932. The site chosen was a small bluff above the barracks and above Queen&#x27;s Road, then at the waterfront.

The building was designed in Greek revival style. Historians suspect it was designed either by Murdoch Bruce, a Scotsman who was inspector of buildings, or by Lieutenant Bernard Collinson of the Royal Engineers. Construction was completed in 1846, and the first occupant was Major-General George Charles D&#x27;Aguilar, General Officer Commanding from 1844 to 1846, who also held the post of Lieutenant Governor.

The west and east wings were shelled during the Japanese invasion in the Second World War; it also suffered bomb damage. The Japanese repaired it and the Commandant took the building as his residence during the occupation.

After the war, Flagstaff House was again the Commander&#x27;s residence until 1978, when the Commander moved to a purpose built house on Barker Road. It was handed over by the military to the civilian Hong Kong Government as part of the recovery of Victoria Barracks. The Government put it under the responsibility of the Urban Council in 1981.

The building was declared a monument in 1989. It was restored as far as possible to its original mid-19th-century appearance, structurally reinforced, and the interior was to be modified so that it could be used as a museum.

==Museum of Tea Ware==

In 1984, it was converted into the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware, a branch museum of the Hong Kong Museum of Art. The museum specialises in the collection, study and display of teaware, including many samples of the Yixing teapot, from Jiangsu Province, China, as well as the world&#x27;s oldest known extant teapot.

A new wing, the K.S. Lo Gallery, was built and opened in 1995. It is named after local collector (and Vitasoy founder Dr. Kwee Seong Lo), who made a donation to the city in the 1970s. This donation now constitutes the core of the museum&#x27;s collection. The new gallery contains a collection of ceramics and Chinese seals.

<text>A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart and has been identified as the prototype of charts.

A bar graph shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered or stacked in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.

==History==

Many sources consider William Playfair (1759-1824) to have invented the bar chart and the &quot;Exports and Imports of Scotland to and from different parts for one Year from Christmas 1780 to Christmas 1781&quot; graph from his &quot;The Commercial and Political Atlas&quot; to be the first bar chart in history. Diagrams of the velocity of a constantly accelerating object against time published in &quot;The Latitude of Forms&quot; (attributed to Jacobus de Sancto Martino or, perhaps, to Nicole Oresme) about 300 years before can be interpreted as &quot;proto bar charts&quot;.

==Usage==
Bar graphs/charts provide a visual presentation of categorical data. Categorical data is a grouping of data into discrete groups, such as months of the year, age group, shoe sizes, and animals. These categories are usually qualitative. In a column (vertical) bar chart, categories appear along the horizontal axis and the height of the bar corresponds to the value of each category.

Bar charts have a discrete domain of categories, and are usually scaled so that all the data can fit on the chart. When there is no natural ordering of the categories being compared, bars on the chart may be arranged in any order. Bar charts arranged from highest to lowest incidence are called Pareto charts.

===Grouped (clustered) and stacked===
Bar graphs can also be used for more complex comparisons of data with grouped (or &quot;clustered&quot;) bar charts, and stacked bar charts.

In grouped (clustered) bar charts, for each categorical group there are two or more bars color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped bar chart with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show revenue.

Alternatively, Stacked bar charts (also known as Composite bar charts) stack bars on top of each other so that the height of the resulting stack shows the combined result. Unlike a grouped bar chart where each factor is displayed next to another, each with their own bar, the stacked bar chart displays multiple data points stacked in a single row or column. This may, for instance, take the form of uniform height bars charting a time series with internal stacked colours indicating the percentage participation of a sub-type of data. Another example would be a time series displaying total numbers, with internal colors indicating participation in the total by sub-types. Stacked bar charts are not suited to data sets having both positive and negative values.

Grouped bar charts usually present the information in the same order in each grouping. Stacked bar charts present the information in the same sequence on each bar.

===Variable-width (variwide)===
Variable-width bar charts, sometimes abbreviated &quot;variwide&quot; (bar) charts, are bar charts having bars with non-uniform widths. Generally:
* Bars represent quantities with respective rectangles of areas &quot;A&quot; that are respective arithmetic products of related pairs of
:::— vertical-axis quantities (&quot;A/X&quot;) and
:::— horizontal-axis quantities (&quot;X&quot;). sajith 300
:Anuradhapura 230
* Arithmetically, the area of each bar (rectangle) is determined a product of sides&#x27; lengths:
::&quot;codice_1 = Area A&quot; for each bar
Roles of the vertical and horizontal axes may be reversed, depending on the desired application.

Examples of variable-width bar charts are shown at Wikimedia Commons.

===Advantages===

# Easy to read and interpret: Bar charts are easy to read and interpret, even for people without a background in statistics or data visualization. The bars make it easy to compare values and see trends, making it a useful tool for communicating information to a wide range of audiences.
# Can handle large amounts of data: Bar charts can handle large amounts of data and still provide a clear representation of the information. The bars can be made narrow or wide to fit a large number of categories or data points, and the use of color or patterns can make it easier to distinguish between them.
# Customizable: Bar charts can be customized to suit the needs of the user. For example, the color, width, and height of the bars can be adjusted to make the chart more visually appealing, and labels and annotations can be added to provide additional information.
# Useful for comparing values: Bar charts are particularly useful for comparing values between categories or data points. They allow for quick identification of differences and similarities, making it easy to draw conclusions and make decisions.

===Limitations===

# Limited use for continuous data: Bar charts are not useful for displaying continuous data, such as temperature or time. For continuous data, a line chart or scatter plot may be more appropriate. Bar charts of continuous data with error bars are sometimes referred to as dynamite plots.
# Limited use for small sample sizes: Bar charts may not be useful for displaying small sample sizes, as the bars may not accurately represent the data. In such cases, a histogram or box plot may be more appropriate.
# May be misleading: Bar charts can be misleading if the scale is not appropriate or if the data is presented in a way that is designed to mislead the viewer. For example, if the y-axis is truncated, the differences between the bars may appear larger than they actually are.
# Limited scope for multivariate data: Bar charts can only display one or two variables at a time, making them less useful for displaying multivariate data. In such cases, a scatter plot or heat map may be more appropriate.

<doc id="393318" wikidata="Q2990379" url="?curid=393318" title="Gift wrapping algorithm">
<text>In computational geometry, the gift wrapping algorithm is an algorithm for computing the convex hull of a given set of points.

==Planar case==
In the two-dimensional case the algorithm is also known as Jarvis march, after R. A. Jarvis, who published it in 1973; it has O(&quot;nh&quot;) time complexity, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of points and &quot;h&quot; is the number of points on the convex hull. Its real-life performance compared with other convex hull algorithms is favorable when n is small or h is expected to be very small with respect to n. In general cases, the algorithm is outperformed by many others (see Convex hull algorithms).

==Algorithm==
For the sake of simplicity, the description below assumes that the points are in general position, i.e., no three points are collinear. The algorithm may be easily modified to deal with collinearity, including the choice whether it should report only extreme points (vertices of the convex hull) or all points that lie on the convex hull. Also, the complete implementation must choose how to deal with degenerate cases when the convex hull has only 1 or 2 vertices, as well as with the issues of limited arithmetic precision, both of computer computations and input data.
The gift wrapping algorithm begins with &quot;i&quot;=0 and a point &quot;p0&quot; known to be on the convex hull, e.g., the leftmost point, and selects the point &quot;pi+1&quot; such that all points are to the right of the line &quot;pi pi+1&quot;. This point may be found in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) time by comparing polar angles of all points with respect to point &quot;pi&quot; taken for the center of polar coordinates. Letting &quot;i&quot;=&quot;i&quot;+1, and repeating with until one reaches &quot;ph&quot;=&quot;p0&quot; again yields the convex hull in &quot;h&quot; steps. In two dimensions, the gift wrapping algorithm is similar to the process of winding a string (or wrapping paper) around the set of points.

The approach can be extended to higher dimensions.

==Pseudocode==
 algorithm jarvis(S) is
 // &quot;S&quot; is the set of points
 // &quot;P&quot; will be the set of points which form the convex hull. Final set size is i.
 pointOnHull := leftmost point in S // which is guaranteed to be part of the CH(S)
 i := 0
 repeat
 P[i] := pointOnHull
 endpoint := S[0] // initial endpoint for a candidate edge on the hull
 for j from 0 to |S| do
 // endpoint == pointOnHull is a rare case and can happen only when j == 1 and a better endpoint has not yet been set for the loop
 if (endpoint == pointOnHull) or (S[j] is on left of line from P[i] to endpoint) then
 endpoint := S[j] // found greater left turn, update endpoint
 i := i + 1
 pointOnHull := endpoint
 until endpoint == P[0] // wrapped around to first hull point

==Complexity==
The inner loop checks every point in the set &quot;S&quot;, and the outer loop repeats for each point on the hull. Hence the total run time is formula_1. The run time depends on the size of the output, so Jarvis&#x27;s march is an output-sensitive algorithm.

However, because the running time depends linearly on the number of hull vertices, it is only faster than formula_2 algorithms such as Graham scan when the number &quot;h&quot; of hull vertices is smaller than log &quot;n&quot;. Chan&#x27;s algorithm, another convex hull algorithm, combines the logarithmic dependence of Graham scan with the output sensitivity of the gift wrapping algorithm, achieving an asymptotic running time formula_3 that improves on both Graham scan and gift wrapping.

<text>Operation Big was an operation of the Alsos Mission, the Allied seizure of facilities, materiel, and personnel related to the German nuclear weapon project during World War II. It was tasked with sweeping several targeted towns in the area of southwest Germany designated to the French First Army, including Hechingen, Bisingen, Haigerloch, and Tailfingen.

Operating behind German lines the U.S. task force successfully carried out its mission of seizing or destroying all project related assets and capturing its top scientists in the last week of April and first week of May, 1945.

==History==
Shortly after the liberation of Paris it was decided to bomb German nuclear facilities wherever they lay in order to deprive the Soviet Union of their technology and personnel, unless American troops could get to them first. Worried that French forces might beat the US to Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s laboratory in Hechingen, Alsos chief Lt-Col Boris Pash hastily organized a flying column of combat engineers from the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion, the U.S. Sixth Army Group&#x27;s T-Force intelligence assault force (&quot;Task Force A&quot;). His team reached Horb three days later and headed for Haigerloch while the French forward troops occupied themselves with looking for members of the Vichy Government twenty miles deeper into Württemberg in the Sigmaringen enclave.

Pash and his engineers, accompanied by the Sixth Army Group&#x27;s Chief of Intelligence, General Eugene Harrison, overran Haigerloch on 23 April 1945.
Here the elated scientists made their first big discovery. As the engineer troops consolidated the group’s position in the town, the ALSOS team shot open a bolted door sealing the entrance to a cave in the side of a cliff. Inside, the team found a large chamber and several smaller rooms crammed with instruments, control boxes, and an array of cylinders described by a frightened German technician as a uranium machine. Though missing its uranium element, the device was an operating atomic pile, captured undamaged.

With help from engineers, the scientists spent two days dismantling the equipment. Three large drums of heavy water, used to control the reaction in the pile, were later found in the laboratory&#x27;s main chamber and a German scientist told Pash that the reactor&#x27;s uranium cubes had been concealed beneath hay in a nearby barn.

The task force then proceeded to Hechingen where they found and detained Erich Bagge, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, and Karl Wirtz, then went on to Tailfingen where they arrested Otto Hahn. Heisenberg, who had left Hechingen on 19 April, was captured by Pash and a small force at his home in Urfeld am Walchensee, on 3 May 1945.

<text>Hong Kong Disneyland () (abbreviated HKDL; also known as HK Disneyland or Disneyland Hong Kong) is a theme park located on reclaimed land in Penny&#x27;s Bay, Lantau Island, Hong Kong. It opened to visitors on Monday, September 12, 2005, at 13:00 HKT, the second Disneyland in Asia to open after Tokyo Disneyland in 1983, with Shanghai Disneyland later opening in 2016. Hong Kong Disneyland is located inside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and is owned jointly by Hong Kong International Theme Parks (52%) and the Walt Disney Company (48%). It is the most visited theme park in Hong Kong, followed by Ocean Park Hong Kong. Disney attempted to avoid problems of cultural backlash by incorporating Chinese culture, customs, and traditions when designing and building the resort, including adherence to the rules of feng shui. Notably, a bend was put in a walkway near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort entrance so good qi energy would not flow into the South China Sea.

The park consists of eight themed areas: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, Toy Story Land, and World of Frozen. The newest themed area — World of Frozen, opened on 20 November 2023. There are single tickets and annual passes, called Magic Access, that are available for tourists who visit Hong Kong Disneyland. The theme park&#x27;s cast members speak Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Printed guide maps were printed in traditional and simplified Chinese as well as English. Guide maps are now available on the Hong Kong Disneyland mobile app as well as the ability to reserve park visits and other related information for park visits.

The park has a daily capacity of 34,000 visitors — the lowest of all Disneyland parks. The park attracted 5.2 million visitors in its first year, below its target of 5.6 million. Visitor numbers fell 20% in the second year to 4 million, inciting criticisms from local legislators. However, the park attendance jumped by 8% in the third year, attracting a total of 4.5 million visitors in 2007. In 2009, the park attendance again increased by 2% to 4.8 million visitors. The attendance continued to surge and received 5.23 million guests in the 2009/2010 fiscal year. Since the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland, the theme park has hosted over 100 million guests. Hong Kong Disneyland currently occupies and hosts 6–7 million visitors annually, with 6.4 million guests in 2023 making it the 17th-most visited theme park in the world. The park capacity will increase to handle up to 10 million visitors annually over a 15-year expansion period. The park first turned an annual net profit of million (million) for the year ended 29 September 2012. However, it has operated at an increasing loss in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Penny&#x27;s Bay was filled in to provide land for the construction of Hong Kong Disneyland. The bay was previously undeveloped except for the Cheoy Lee Shipyard, which opened in the 1960s.

The city&#x27;s chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, was instrumental in introducing the Disneyland project to Hong Kong. When the SARS epidemic devastated the city&#x27;s economy in 2003, it was hoped that the new Disneyland would help boost confidence in Hong Kong&#x27;s tourism industry.

Hong Kong Disneyland had one of the shortest construction periods of any Disneyland-style theme park. On 12 January 2003, more than 400 guests celebrated the groundbreaking of Hong Kong Disneyland after the finishing of land reclamation in Penny&#x27;s Bay. The audience included Tung Chee-hwa; Michael D. Eisner, former chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company; Bob Iger, president of The Walt Disney Company; and Jay Rasulo, former president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. On 23 September 2004, a special &quot;castle topping ceremony&quot; was held in the park to commemorate the placing of the tallest turret on Sleeping Beauty Castle.

On 12 September 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland was officially opened to the public. The opening ceremony was officiated by Zeng Qinghong, who was then the vice president of China. To help Hong Kong Disneyland grow, the Chinese government had deliberately slowed down the development of Shanghai Disney Resort, which was first conceived in the early 2000s.

=== Expansion ===
In January 2012, Hong Kong Disneyland has been in the process of negotiating with the Government of Hong Kong to invest its HK$5 billion profit for new attractions. Further details of the expansion would be announced within a 12-month period from January 2012. A shopping complex and new hotels would be taken into consideration for the new expansion plan.

In Hong Kong financial secretary John Tsang&#x27;s 2013–14 budget speech, he announced that a new night time parade: &quot;Disney Paint The Night Parade&quot;, as well as a themed area featuring characters from the Marvel Universe, will be built in Hong Kong Disneyland. On 8 October 2013 then Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Thomas O. Staggs confirmed the development of the Iron Man Experience.

On 17 February 2014, Hong Kong Disneyland announced its 2012–13 financial results as well as a plan for the third hotel at the resort. The third hotel would be the largest hotel at the resort, featuring 750 rooms with an adventure and exotic theme, and would cost to build. The third hotel, Disney Explorers Lodge, opened on 30 April 2017.

Hong Kong Disneyland was also built with the space for a second park directly across from the entrance to the current park. Disney has not yet announced that the second park is in development. Land is also available for additional hotels other than the three current, but the common thought is that the second park will be built before a fourth hotel. However, it was announced in September 2020 by the Hong Kong Government that Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s option to purchase the 60-hectare expansion site next to the existing park will not be extended after its expiry on 24 September 2020 as it is unable to commit to using the site in the near future.

On 22 November 2016, the Walt Disney Company and the Hong Kong Government announced plans for a multi-year, expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland. The proposed expansion includes a &quot;Frozen&quot;-themed area (announced for 2021), a Marvel-themed area (opening in phases from 2018 to 2023), a redesigned castle to succeed Sleeping Beauty Castle and hub (announced for 2020), a reimagined attraction (announced for 2021), a new &quot;Moana&quot; stage show (announced for 2018), and live entertainment.

On 24 May 2018, Hong Kong Disneyland opened the first project part of the multi-year expansion: Moana: a Homecoming Celebration, an atmosphere stage show performed daily at the newly built Jungle Junction venue in Adventureland. The park also gave more information on the coming projects as well as the revised dates for these projects: the shooting dark ride Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, replacing Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, opened in 2019 and the new expanded castle will be unveiled in 2020, in time for the park&#x27;s 15th anniversary. Park officials also confirmed the rumors that the future &quot;Frozen&quot;-themed area will feature a copy of Epcot&#x27;s Frozen Ever After and a family roller coaster named Wandering Oaken’s Sliding Sleighs, replacing the previously announced Dancing Sleighs ride, and that the area was opened in 2023.

On 26 January 2020, the park closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with Ocean Park Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland Park. It remained closed for nearly five months, reopening on 18 June 2020. It was the second worldwide Disney park to reopen after Shanghai Disneyland. It reopened with similar strict rules as Shanghai Disneyland, which included limited guest attendance, social distancing, temperature checks, and mandatory wearing of face masks. Hong Kong Disneyland closed again from 15 July to 25 September 2020 due to a heavy upsurge in domestic cases. After reopening for approximately two months, it was announced the park would close for a third time on 2 December 2020 due to a rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region. The park reopened on 19 February 2021. The park closed for the fourth time on 7 January 2022 due to the rising number of cases of the Omicron variant, and reopened on 21 April 2022.

In 2023, Hong Kong Disneyland expanded again and created the world&#x27;s first and largest &quot;Frozen&quot; theme park – &quot;Frozen World&quot;, which officially opened to tourists on 20 November of that year. Visitors can experience the adventure journey of Arendelle here.

== Park layout and attractions ==

Hong Kong Disneyland is located on Lantau Island, is divided into &quot;lands&quot; (themed areas) and well-concealed backstage areas. On entering a land, a guest is completely immersed in a themed environment and is unable to see or hear any other realm. The idea behind this was to develop theatrical &quot;stages&quot; with seamless passages from one land to the next. The public areas occupy approximately . When the park initially opened, it consisted of only four themed areas instead of the traditional five lands:

* Main Street, U.S.A., designed to resemble an early 20th-century Midwest town.
* Fantasyland, bringing to life characters from fairy tales and Disney films.
* Tomorrowland, an optimistic vision of the future.
* Adventureland, featuring jungle-themed adventures.

On 30 June 2009, Donald Tsang, the then Chief Executive of Hong Kong, announced that the expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland had been approved by the Executive Council. The park received three new themed lands — Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point and Toy Story Land — all located outside the Disneyland Railroad track, south of the current area.

* Toy Story Land, based on the Disney·Pixar film series &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Opened 18 November 2011.
* Grizzly Gulch, reminiscing an abandoned mining town set amidst mountains and woods. Opened 14 July 2012.
* Mystic Point, heart of a dense, uncharted rain forest where supernatural events take place. Opened 17 May 2013.

On 2 May 2017, the Executive Council approved another multi-year expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland, adding two new themed lands — World of Frozen and Stark Expo — to the park.

* World of Frozen, themed to the popular Disney franchise &quot;Frozen&quot;. Opened on 20 November 2023.
* Stark Expo, inviting guests to combat villains with Marvel superheroes. Opening in TBA.

On February 25, 2025, HKDL Managing Director Michael Moriarty approved a 20th-anniversary expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland, introducing a new themed land - Pixar Entertainment Experience - to the park.

* Pixar Entertainment Experience, visitors can anticipate immersing themselves in the world of Pixar, with attractions inspired by beloved films such as Inside Out. Moreover, a broader selection of Pixar-themed merchandise will be available for guests to enjoy. Opening in TBA

Throughout the park are &#x27;Hidden Mickeys&#x27;, or representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor.

An elevated berm supports the narrow gauge Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad (built by Severn Lamb) that circumnavigates the park.

===Lands of Hong Kong Disneyland===

Hong Kong Disneyland has eight themed areas, each with different attractions, live entertainment, meet and greet, dining and boutiques.

====Main Street, U.S.A.====

Inspired by the Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland, the buildings of this Main Street are almost identical to those in Anaheim. Like other Disney theme parks, Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s Main Street, U.S.A. serves as the entrance of the park. Plans originally featured a restaurant under the Railroad station, but were scrapped due to budget reasons. The decor is small-town America from the years 1890–1910.

Though being very similar to Anaheim&#x27;s main street, the theme is heavily influenced by European immigrants. Plaza Inn — which has the identical exterior design as the one in Disneyland — mimics a classical Chinese eatery that was created by a wealthy American couple who were infatuated with Chinese culture. Another restaurant, the Market House Bakery is reminiscent of a bakery founded by a Viennese pastry chef who brought the world&#x27;s most famous desserts from the Austrian imperial court.

Unlike Main Streets from other parks, Main Street at Hong Kong Disneyland is built mainly of wood instead of stone. There are no horse-drawn streetcars, though tracks for another of the Main Street Vehicle can be seen in concept art. 

At the end of Main Street is the Castle of Magical Dreams. Opened in 2020, it is double the height of the previous park centerpiece, Sleeping Beauty Castle, the nodes are integrated with symbols relating to 13 princesses. The castle forecourt features a show stage and viewing area for the new daytime stage show and nighttime spectacular, &quot;Follow Your Dreams&quot; and &quot;Momentous&quot;.

The new walk-through attraction &quot;Duffy and Friends Play House&quot; added in 2023.

====Fantasyland====

Fantasyland features the Castle of Magical Dreams (which replaced the Sleeping Beauty Castle) as its icon. The attractions in this area include Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and It&#x27;s a Small World. There is also Fantasy Gardens where costumed Disney characters can be met, and a Fairy Tale Forest. The Fantasyland is also home to the &quot;Mickey and the Wondrous Book&quot; stage show.

====Tomorrowland====

Tomorrowland at Hong Kong Disneyland is themed to a SpacePort which features an emphasis on metallic trim, dominated by blue and purple hues. Since the opening of the park, unique attractions have been added into the Hong Kong&#x27;s Tomorrowland. 

To celebrate the release of the new Star Wars movie, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Star Wars-themed rides debuted at Hong Kong Disneyland, and Star Wars: Hyperspace Mountain subsequently became a permanent major attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland.

The first ever Marvel attraction in a Disney theme park, The Iron Man Experience, opened on 11 January 2017 in an area previously envisioned for a Star Tours-type attraction. The land also featured Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters on opening day, but that was replaced with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, which opened on 31 March 2019. Hong Kong Disneyland announced that the attractions will be redesigned and become part of Stark Expo.

====Adventureland====

Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s Adventureland is the biggest among all Disney parks. It features a large island area home to Tarzan&#x27;s Treehouse, which is circled by the Jungle Cruise (Jungle River Cruise) — much like the Rivers of America in most Frontierland theme areas. The Adventureland is also home to the &quot;Festival of the Lion King&quot; stage show. The new atmosphere stage show &quot;Moana: a Homecoming Celebration&quot; debuted on 25 May 2018 at Jungle Junction. A new outdoor venue. it is the first part of the multi-year expansion being unveiled to the public.

====Toy Story Land====

Opened on 18 November 2011, Toy Story Land is the first new themed land since the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005. It is located to the west side of the park, behind Fantasyland. Toy Story Land is themed using bamboo to act as giant blades of grass surrounding the area. The themed land makes use of characters from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies, such as an enlarged Woody, Rex, an oversized paper plane, and Luxo Jr.

Toy Story Land was marketed by the park as an &quot;Asia exclusive&quot;. For some time its only counterpart was Toy Story Playland at Walt Disney Studios Park in Marne-la-Vallée, France. After Toy Story Land’s popular in Hong Kong, it dolled out across the other Disney Parks in the world, with one at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando opening in June 2018 and one in Shanghai Disneyland opening on April 26, 2018.

The main attractions include Slinky Dog Spin, Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, and RC Racer.

====Grizzly Gulch====

Opened on 14 July 2012, this land is the Hong Kong equivalent of Frontierland and Critter Country. The themed land reminisces an abandoned mining town called &quot;Grizzly Gulch&quot;, set amidst mountains and woods. The centrepiece structure is Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, inspired by Grizzly Peak in Disney California Adventure Park. The town was set to be founded 8 August 1888 — the luckiest day of the luckiest month of the luckiest year — by prospectors looking to discover gold.

====Mystic Point====

Opened on 17 May 2013, Mystic Point is a new themed land in Hong Kong Disneyland. It is set in 1909 at an adventurer&#x27;s outpost established in 1896 in a dense, uncharted rain forest surrounded by mysterious forces and supernatural events. The site features Mystic Manor, home of Lord Henry Mystic, a world traveler and adventurer and his mischievous monkey, Albert.

====World of Frozen====
A land behind Fantasyland hosts two rides themed to the movie &quot;Frozen&quot;. World of Frozen is set in the fictional Kingdom of Arendelle. The land features two rides, a dark ride similar to Frozen Ever After at EPCOT, and a sleigh-style family rollercoaster, called Wandering Oaken&#x27;s Sliding Sleighs. 
&quot;Playhouse in the Woods&quot; is a live interactive show based on the film Frozen II in World of Frozen at Hong Kong Disneyland. It was originally set to open in 2020, but the opening date was delayed to 20 November 2023, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Stark Expo====

On 22 November 2016, it was announced that Tomorrowland would be partly transformed into a Marvel-themed area, as part of a massive six year expansion plan. The first ever Marvel attraction in a Disney theme park, The Iron Man Experience, opened on 11 January 2017 in an area previously envisioned for a Star Tours-type attraction. The replacement of Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters by an attraction featuring Ant-Man and The Wasp, named &quot;Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!&quot; for 2019 and the construction, on the former Autopia site, of a major E ticket attraction, &quot;Avengers Quinjet&quot;, based on the Avengers franchise, which was originally set to be completed by 2024. However, at D23 2024 on 10 August 2024, it was cancelled to make way for a new unnamed Spider-Man attraction. 

On 25 February 2025, Hong Kong Disneyland has confirmed that an expansion is still in the works. At D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event last year, they announced the introduction of a new Spider-Man attraction. The Marvel area is positioned adjacent to Tomorrowland.

On February 25, 2025, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort unveiled plans for a significant expansion of their theme park, introducing a new Pixar Entertainment Experience. An &quot;all-new, exclusive Pixar Entertainment Experience&quot; is set to be added to the park. Hong Kong Disneyland released a map pinpointing the location of this experience between Toy Story Land and the World of Frozen. This experience will be the first of its kind and unique to Hong Kong Disneyland, although specific details have not yet been revealed. The new Pixar entertainment experience will be situated at the northern part of the theme park. Visitors can anticipate immersing themselves in the world of Pixar, with attractions inspired by beloved films like Inside Out.

Both shows were slated to premiere in 2020 for Hong Kong Disneyland’s 15th anniversary celebration (in fact, &quot;Momentous&quot; uses the anniversary anthem &quot;Love the Memory&quot; as its main theme), but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Public transport==
===MTR===
The park is accessible on the MTR via the purpose-built Disneyland Resort line, a themed shuttle train service between the Disneyland Resort station adjacent to the park, and Sunny Bay station, where passengers can transfer to the Tung Chung line for access to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, or Tung Chung. The line runs modified Metro Cammell M-Trains on the non-stop route. The trains run fully automatically without drivers. The first train of the day from Sunny Bay station to Disneyland Resort departs at 06:15 and the last train at 00:45.

===Bus===
Long Win Bus operates 3 regular routes to the Disneyland Resort Public Transport Interchange in front of the park.
Route R8 is a circular route running between Disneyland and the Lantau Link Toll Plaza Bus Interchange. The latter can be accessed by any of the routes with the A or E prefixes (e.g. A11 or E32), and is always the first stop after crossing the Tsing Ma Bridge. It is the only all-day route serving the park, and is jointly operated with vehicles from Citybus.

Two additional regular routes, running on weekends and public holidays only, provide direct service between other places in the New Territories and Disneyland. They are route R33 to Tuen Mun station, connecting to the MTR, and route R42 to Tai Wai station via Tsuen Wan and Sha Tin. For both routes, one trip departs towards Disneyland in the mornings and the return trip departs approximately 20 minutes after the evening fireworks display.

In addition to the above regular trips, seven special routes (including one cross-harbour route) operate to and from Disneyland before and after special events at the park, of which two are operated by Citybus and the other five by Long Win Bus.

Certain midday and late evening trips of Citybus route B5 between the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Hong Kong Port and Sunny Bay station are routed via Disneyland.

==Criticisms==
===2005/2006 Overcrowding problems===
Just before the grand opening, the park was criticised for overestimating the daily capacity. The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on 4 September 2005, when 30,000 locals visited the park. The event turned out to be a disappointment, as there were too many guests. Wait times at fast food outlets were at least 45 minutes, and wait times at rides went up to 2 hours.

Although the park&#x27;s shareholders and the Hong Kong Government set pressure upon the park to lower the capacity, the park insisted on keeping the limit, only agreeing to relieve the capacity problem by extending the opening time by one hour and introducing more discounts during weekdays. However, the park stated that local visitors tend to stay in the park for more than nine hours per visit, implying that the mentioned practices would do little to solve the problem.

During the Lunar New Year 2006, many visitors arrived at the park in the morning bearing valid tickets, but were refused entry, because the park was already at full capacity. Some disgruntled visitors, mainly tourists, attempted to force their way into the park by climbing over the barrier gates. Disneyland management was forced to revise their ticketing policy and designated future periods close to public holidays as &#x27;special days&#x27; during which admission would only be allowed through a date-specific ticket. Ticket prices during the week were changed to reflect cheaper prices. Meanwhile, weekend prices were raised. The prices were changed in an attempt to crowd-control so the crowds would be more even throughout the week and therefore the lines would not be as bad on weekends.

==Public relations==
Disney initially refused to release the attendance figures after media reports surfaced saying the park&#x27;s attendance numbers might be lower than expected. Disney finally declared on 24 November 2005, that Disney had over 1 million guests during its first two months of operation.

In response to negative publicity locally and to boost visitor numbers, Hong Kong Disneyland offered $50 discounts for admission tickets to holders of Hong Kong I.D. cards in the period before 2005 Christmas. Also, from March to June 2006, the park offered Hong Kong I.D. card holders the opportunity to purchase a two-day admission ticket for the price of a single day ticket.

==Attendance==
The significant decline in attendance between 2020 and 2023 is due to the COVID-19 regulations imposed in Hong Kong, which included, during several periods, temporary closure of the Resort, reduction in Park capacity, quarantine measures and vaccinations required for visitors entering Hong Kong.

==In popular culture==
In the 2012 Indian Tamil-language musical romantic comedy film Podaa Podi, a song depicting the relationship between a father and son, written by Vaali and sung by Silambarasan himself, was shot with him and his 1 year old nephew Samarth at Hong Kong Disneyland, making it the first Tamil film to be shot there.

The hit Indian sitcom Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah filmed episodes 1470 to 1478 at Hong Kong Disneyland, where various show characters experienced the attractions.

The music video for the song &quot;Boss&quot; by MIRROR was filmed at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2021.

<text>Operation Harborage was an operation to capture German nuclear energy program scientists, materiel, and facilities in southwestern Germany in the waning days of World War II.

==History==
Part of the Allied Alsos Mission, Operation Harborage was led by Manhattan Project intelligence division chief Col. John Lansdale, Jr. on behalf of project head General Leslie Groves, under the direction of Alsos commander Col. Boris Pash. It was carried out by Alsos team members assisted by combat engineers from the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion, the U.S. Sixth Army&#x27;s T-Force intelligence assault force.

Shortly after the liberation of Paris it was decided to bomb German nuclear facilities wherever they lay in order to deprive the Soviet Union of their technology and personnel, unless American troops could get to them first. In late April 1945 Harborage teams were directed toward the Black Forest cities of Hechingen, Bisingen and Haigerloch. These centers of the relocated German effort were all scheduled to be seized by the French and occupied by them post-war.

By cutting ahead of the French First Army&#x27;s forward troops and operating behind enemy lines American technical intelligence units swept the area clean, seizing and transporting what they could and destroying the rest. The result left the French deprived of a share of the boost German technology and brainpower provided other Allies through the Cold War; these ended up divided among the U.S. (which reaped the lion&#x27;s share), Soviet Union, and Britain.

<text>Utrecht Science Park (also known as De Uithof) is a neighbourhood in Utrecht and the largest science park in the Netherlands. It is located to the east of the city. It is the largest campus of Utrecht University. Apart from the faculties of Law, Humanities and University College Utrecht, most of the university buildings are located in Utrecht Science Park. It is also a main location of the HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht and the University Medical Center Utrecht, and houses the main university library, student housing and botanical gardens.

==History==

The Dutch government purchased a plot of land of approximately 300 hectares for Utrecht University in 1958. The area was named &quot;De Uithof&quot;, after a local farm. The first building, currently known as the Marinus Ruppert Building, opened in 1961.

The city council decided to officially rename De Uithof to &quot;Utrecht Science Park&quot; in 2018.

==Transportation==
On 14 December 2019, the &quot;Uithoflijn&quot; line 22 of the Utrecht sneltram (light rail) system opened, connecting Utrecht Centraal railway station to De Uithof. It replaced bus line 12 which used bi-articulated buses. The &quot;Uithoflijn&quot; has 5 tram stops in De Uithof: Padualaan, Heidelberglaan, UMC, WKZ / Máxima and the tram terminal P+R Science Park.

The tram stop P+R Science Park has a large park-and-ride facility, designed by KCAP, construction of which began in August 2011.

==Buildings in De Uithof==
Some of the buildings on De Uithof have an unusual architecture, and some have won prizes for their architecture. The Educatorium, designed by Rem Koolhaas (1997), contains a glass-bottomed walking bridge and circular walls. The Minnaertgebouw used to contain a large basin that was used to collect rain water, and its outer wall is supported by large characters, M, I, N, N, A, E, R, T. The Universiteitsbibliotheek (University Library), designed by Wiel Arets (2004), is known for its spacious interior and black exterior. All three of these buildings are featured in the book &quot;1001 Buildings You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

===University buildings===
This is a partial list of buildings at the Utrecht Science Park. The official names of all of the buildings are found here. Many of the buildings are named after scientists that worked in a field which is similar to the specialization of the occupants of the building.

<text>BBC Parliament is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel from the BBC that showcases parliamentary content from across the United Kingdom. It broadcasts live and recorded coverage of the British Parliament (House of Commons, House of Lords and Select Committees), the Scottish Parliament, the London Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Senedd. When none of these chambers are sitting, the channel does not broadcast, and its feed is given over to a simulcast of the BBC News channel.

As of January 2022, the channel had a typical weekly peak of approximately 120,000 viewers, during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, representing a monthly reach of 5.41% of UK TV households and 0.06% overall share.

== History ==


John Reith, 1st Baron Reith, the first director-general of the BBC, wanted to broadcast Parliament on radio from the BBC&#x27;s founding in 1922, but the government rejected the idea, as it did proposals from MPs during the 1920s and 1930s. During the Attlee government, a committee led by William Beveridge found that broadcasting parliament would be harmful. A one-month experiment in broadcasting parliament on radio began on 9 June 1975, and MPs on 16 March 1976 voted to continue. Permanent radio broadcasts from the House of Commons began on 3 April 1978, and from the House of Lords on 4 April. The 1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry was among the important events broadcast live.

In 1991, United Artists Programming initiated a trial project to provide highlights of debates from Parliament in a programme called &quot;Yesterday in the Commons&quot; to cable networks across the UK. The trial was deemed to be a success and this led to United Artists Cable launching a full time service, The Parliamentary Channel on 13 January 1992, to provide live and recorded coverage of the British Parliament. It also aired full live coverage of the September party conference season.

In 1998 the channel was purchased by the BBC and was relaunched on 23 September 1998 as BBC Parliament. It now broadcasts on cable, satellite, and Freeview. This followed the launch three years earlier of a Digital Audio Broadcasting, from the Crystal Palace transmitting station, which had offered is a relay of events in Parliament. This audio service became a relay of BBC Parliament when the channel launched, and continued until the DAB radio service was closed down on 14 November 2000.

Due to capacity limitations on the digital terrestrial television platform, now known as Freeview, from launch until 15 October 2002, the channel ran as &quot;audio only&quot;. Then on digital terrestrial (now known as Freeview) from 14 October 2002 until 13 November 2006 the channel was only able to broadcast a quarter-screen picture. After receiving &quot;thousands of angry and perplexed emails and letters&quot;, not to mention questions asked by MPs in the House itself, the BBC eventually found the bandwidth to make the channel full-screen. Viewers were advised to retune their TVs or set-top boxes to receive the full-screen version of BBC Parliament.

Until 2008, BBC Parliament was unique amongst the BBC channels in being broadcast using non-BBC facilities, with ITV&#x27;s Millbank Studios in Westminster supplying the engineering and playout facilities. Production, editorial and journalism were, however, maintained by the BBC.

The previous idents, also based on a Big Ben clock motif, ran from 2009 to 2016. This replaced the channel&#x27;s previous identity which was first introduced in 2002.

BBC Parliament was taken off the air during the 2012 Summer Olympics on Freeview in post-digital switchover areas to enable BBC Three to broadcast 24 hours a day. The BBC had done the same during the 2008 Summer Olympics as it used the space to provide an additional BBC Red Button option for Freeview users.

BBC Parliament HD has been confirmed as launching from 20 October 2021 and rolling out across various platforms at different times right up to the end of 2022, the standard definition service will continue on Freeview. This has been the case since 10 December 2013 when BBC Three, BBC Four, BBC News, CBBC, and CBeebies began high definition simulcasts.

On 5 September 2016 BBC Two began broadcasting BBC Parliament during BBC Two&#x27;s overnight downtime. However this was short-lived and has subsequently been discontinued.

On 14 October 2016, the channel received a new look and new idents, its first revamp since 2009. The channel&#x27;s current identity went live on Monday 10 October 2016 with refreshed music and idents based on clock workings, with colours and images derived from the flags and assemblies of the British home countries and the European Parliament.

In July 2018, the BBC announced that the output on the channel was to be cut back, discontinuing all programming produced for the channel other than parliamentary coverage, and closing the channel entirely during summer months when Parliament and the devolved assemblies are not sitting. The move has been criticised by many including the former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow. In October 2018, the BBC announced that it had shelved these plans.

From 26 July until 31 August 2021, for the first time BBC Parliament simulcast the BBC News channel during a parliamentary recess. This replaced the loop of highlights from the previous Parliamentary session. Starting to broadcast the BBC News Channel during the three major recesses was part of a range of cutbacks to the channel which saw the channel focus only on live and recorded coverage from Westminster and the devolved chambers. Coverage of the House of Lords and Select committees was also reduced. The channel&#x27;s wider political coverage ended at this point. This saw the channel end its mostly live coverage of party conferences, its broadcasts of the BBC&#x27;s national political shows, its Sunday lunchtime simulcast of C-SPAN and repeat of &quot;Question Time&quot; all finished, as did all archive programming. The bespoke highlights programmes &quot;The Day in Parliament&quot; and &quot;The Week in Parliament&quot; and all other programming made for the channel also ended at this point.

In April 2022, BBC Parliament began broadcasting in high-definition, initially only on the Virgin Media platform, BBC Parliament in HD came to Sky and Freesat in February 2023.

Following the death of Elizabeth II, the channel broadcast continuous coverage of the four days of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s lying in state.

== Programming ==

=== Regular programming ===
Whenever the House of Commons is sitting, BBC Parliament carries the chamber live without interruption, with any simultaneous House of Lords sitting being shown in full later the same day and the following morning, often in sections that fit around the sittings of the Commons. The House of Lords is broadcast live only on days when there is no House of Commons sitting scheduled. BBC Parliament also provides full, recorded coverage of the House of Commons&#x27; second chamber Westminster Hall during weekends, when they will also broadcast selected evidence sessions from different select committees of the House of Commons.

Whenever both Westminster chambers are in recess, but a devolved assembly is constituted, the channel will provide live coverage of its work, while during Westminster sessions, coverage of the devolved assemblies usually takes the form of highlights at the weekend of the previous week&#x27;s main debates and business.

Thus, when taken together with both live and recorded coverage from the other bodies it covers, BBC Parliament&#x27;s schedule is dominated by direct broadcasts of the legislative and political institutions, whether they be plenary, quasi-plenary (such as Westminster Hall), or in committees that affect British public life.

==== Election night ====
In the event of one of the devolved nations producing their own results programme on election night, normally the first Thursday in May, BBC Parliament will usually broadcast this telecast to the whole of the United Kingdom. On election night for the 2005, 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections, BBC Parliament aired BBC Scotland&#x27;s result night coverage. A few days afterwards, it would also broadcast a replay of election night coverage from BBC Wales and BBC Northern Ireland. In 2024, the channel aired the network coverage as broadcast as seen on the BBC News Channel due to the channel now carrying the BBC News Channel when none of the UK&#x27;s Parliaments and Assemblies were sitting.

BBC Parliament had also carried BBC Scotland&#x27;s coverage of both the 2011 devolved assembly elections and Scottish Independence Referendum. In March 2011 BBC Parliament simulcast BBC Wales&#x27;s results coverage of the nation&#x27;s devolution referendum.

==== Original programmes ====
Until July 2021, BBC Parliament often broadcast its own original programmes. They were either scheduled or used to fill gaps between the billed programmes, especially when live coverage of a legislative chamber ended before the next programme was due to start. The programmes covered a variety of political and parliamentary subjects, including:

*A to Z of Westminster – A series of short programmes presented by BBC Parliament researchers explaining some of the more common aspects of parliamentary protocol.
*Britain&#x27;s Best Buildings – Only the episode that features the Palace of Westminster was broadcast, usually edited down into short segments that focused on one specific feature of the palace.
*Conversations – Conversations with political figures about their lives and careers, with Parliamentary Correspondent Sean Curran.
*Election File – Short summaries of previous general election results, including short bursts of the BBC&#x27;s original television coverage.
*In House – A new strand of programmes that replaced &quot;A-Z of Westminster&quot; in 2011. The programmes were similar in function to their predecessor series, seeking to explain some of the strange procedures that occur in Parliament.
* Laws and Ladies – A topical chat show, featuring a panel of peers discussing the political issues of the day. Peers featured included Baroness Boothroyd, Baroness Knight of Collingtree and Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde.
*Laying Down the Law – A standalone programme that explained the parliamentary stages a bill must go through to become an Act of Parliament.
*MP Too! – A series of short programmes that looked back at some eighteenth and nineteenth century Members of Parliament (MPs) who were more famous for their work outside of the House of Commons or House of Lords.
*Speaker&#x27;s Lectures – A series of lectures initiated by John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, from 2011 to 2019. To mark the centenary of the Parliament Act 1911, the lectures covered some of the main political figures of the century.
*Village Idioms – Short examinations of modern-day idioms that were coined in Westminster, including &#x27;reading the Riot Act&#x27; and &#x27;flogging a dead horse&#x27;.

=== Archive and special programming ===

==== General election and referendum repeats ====
Between 2002 and 2020, the channel frequently showed recordings of BBC general election coverage, from the 1955 election, the first British election programme to be telerecorded as well as other events such as the 1975 EEC Referendum and the 2016 EU Referendum. Some have been broadcast on the anniversary of their original transmissions. The channel&#x27;s editor has described this as adding &quot;something of value&quot; and says it helps the channel &quot;reach a wider audience for our normal parliamentary schedule&quot;.

1 – Only three hours of the programme is known to exist.
2 – This was given a special introduction by David Dimbleby, the son of Richard Dimbleby who presented the 1959 broadcast. Only the overnight footage was shown because the daytime coverage was not kept.
3 – Only two hours of coverage is known to exist with the surviving coverage originally broadcast in mid-afternoon.
4 – In addition, the overnight coverage of the 1979 election was broadcast on BBC Four on 12 June 2008.
5 – The 1983 coverage was originally scheduled to be shown on 10 October 2003, but was not broadcast.
6 _ The 1987 coverage was originally scheduled to be shown on 10 June 2017 for the 30th anniversary which was the following day 11 June but due to the 2017 General Election having taken place 2 days earlier the planned showing was cancelled and replaced by the re-run of Election 2017
7 – The 1997 coverage was originally scheduled to be shown on 1 May 2017 to coincide with its 20th anniversary but due to the surprise calling of the 2017 general election scheduled for 8 June it was postponed and eventually shown on 4 September 2017.
8 – The 1997 coverage is broadcast &quot;clean&quot;- without the original on-screen graphics, although they have been included on all other election reruns.

==== Special programming ====
From 2002 until 2019 BBC Parliament frequently broadcast programmes that have a historical or broader social significance, often encompassing major events both in the United Kingdom and in the world. They have also included a selection of programmes exploring issues of import and topicality in-depth, akin to BBC Four. They are generally shown on the anniversaries of major events. Programmes in this area have been diverse in character, such as the channel&#x27;s first archive rerun, which was to celebrate the Golden Jubilee in June 2002 when BBC Parliament reran the coronation coverage. All special programming ended in 2020 due to cutbacks at the channel which saw it revert to schedule which only featured live and delayed coverage of the UK&#x27;s Parliamentary bodies.

===== 2005–2006 =====
In 2005, the channel marked the 40th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill by broadcasting archive coverage of his funeral.

Also in 2005, BBC Parliament also marked the 30th anniversary of the first referendum over Europe by reshowing interviews with the two main party leaders, and broadcasting the two hours of the Referendum results coverage which the BBC retains in its archives.

The 50th anniversary of the Suez Crisis was commemorated in November 2006, with writer and broadcaster Anthony Howard introducing a special series of programmes on the channel. This included television broadcasts by the then-prime minister Anthony Eden and the then-Labour Leader of the Opposition Hugh Gaitskell, alongside a new documentary called &quot;Suez in Parliament: a Fine Hullabaloo&quot;.

===== 2007–2008 =====
On 1 April 2007, veteran BBC correspondent Brian Hanrahan introduced &quot;Falklands Night&quot; to mark the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the Falklands War. Programming included the BBC&#x27;s original television news bulletins and reports from the period, alongside editions of &quot;Newsnight&quot; and excerpts of debates from &quot;Question Time&quot;. &quot;Falklands Night&quot; was shown twice during the spring of 2007 to mark the beginning and the end of the conflict.

On 1 July 2007, the channel broadcast &quot;Hong Kong Night&quot;, presented by Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, which reran coverage of the handover ceremony, to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the end of British rule, and the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China.

The tenth anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales was marked on 1 September 2007 with a broadcast of the BBC coverage of her funeral. The rerun was shown at the precise broadcast times of the BBC&#x27;s original coverage, running from 8:25 am until 4:00 pm. David Dimbleby, who anchored the BBC&#x27;s coverage, said a few words at the beginning and end of the rerun.

Cliff Michelmore came out of retirement on 18 November 2007 to present &quot;The Pound in Your Pocket&quot;, a special strand of programming to mark forty years since the devaluation of the Pound by the British government on 18 November 1967. Editions of &quot;The Money Programme&quot; and &quot;24 Hours&quot; were shown along with highlights from the 1968 Budget programme and ministerial broadcasts. The strand&#x27;s title was taken from the famously misquoted television broadcast made by the then-prime minister Harold Wilson about the devaluation on 19 November 1967. Wilson said: &quot;It does not mean that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket, in your purse or bank has been devalued.&quot;

On 26 May 2008, Joan Bakewell introduced an archive evening called &quot;Permissive Night&quot; which examined the liberalising social reform legislation passed by Parliament in the late 1960s. Topics covered included changes to divorce law, the death penalty, the Abortion Act 1967, the Race Relations Act 1968, the partial decriminalisation of homosexual acts (using editions of the documentary series &quot;Man Alive&quot;) and the relaxation of censorship. The evening concluded with a special new edition of &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot;, the review programme that Joan Bakewell presented in the late 1960s.

On 30 November 2008, BBC Parliament broadcast the 1958 State Opening of Parliament to mark 50 years since the event was first televised.

===== 2009 =====
The fall of James Callaghan&#x27;s Labour government was marked on its 30th anniversary – 28 March 2009. Donald MacCormick, making what would prove to be his final television appearance before his death, presented &quot;The Night The Government Fell&quot;, which included nearly three-and-a-half hours of audio highlights of the Commons debate that resulted in Callaghan&#x27;s government losing a vote of no confidence by 311 votes to 310. A documentary charting the evening&#x27;s events was shown, as was McCormick&#x27;s own live programme from Westminster on the night of the vote.

On 28 June 2009, BBC Parliament reran BBC TV&#x27;s coverage of the 1969 Investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales to mark the 40th anniversary of this event. The channel also re-broadcast an interview which Prince Charles gave a few days before his Investiture.

The anniversary of the BBC&#x27;s own &quot;Question Time&quot; series was marked on 25 September 2009 by re-broadcasting the first edition of the topical discussion programme from 30 years earlier. Robin Day presented alongside the inaugural panel of Michael Foot MP, Teddy Taylor, Edna O&#x27;Brien and Archbishop Derek Worlock.

The writer and broadcaster Anthony Howard presented an archive evening on 10 October 2009 entitled &quot;Never Had It So Good&quot;, that looked back on 1959. This included television election broadcasts by the prime minister Harold Macmillan, Leader of the Opposition Hugh Gaitskell and Labour&#x27;s Tony Benn; an edition of &quot;Tonight&quot;; and other BBC current affairs programmes. The evening&#x27;s title is taken from a phrase contained in a speech made by Harold Macmillan in 1957 when he optimistically said, &quot;Let us be frank about it – most of our people have never had it so good&quot;.

===== 2011 =====
At the 2011 Irish general election, BBC Parliament simulcast Irish state broadcaster RTÉ&#x27;s general election results programme on 26 February 2011. The election saw the incumbent Irish government fall to heavy defeat at the hands of the other parties.

<doc id="393331" wikidata="Q837119" url="?curid=393331" title="Kowloon Bay">
<text>Kowloon Bay (Chinese: 九龍灣) is a bay within Victoria Harbour and a neighbourhood within Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The bay is located at the east of the Kowloon Peninsula and north of Hong Kong Island. It is the eastern portion of Victoria Harbour, between Hung Hom and Lei Yue Mun. The bay was divided into half when the 13/31 runway of the former Kai Tak International Airport was constructed in the middle of the bay in the mid-1950s.

The reclamation of north-eastern Kowloon Bay near Ngau Tau Kok is also named Kowloon Bay. It was formerly known asNgau Tau Kok Industrial Area. After the construction of MTR Kowloon Bay station, the area is referred to as Kowloon Bay. The area near the MTR station is residential while the area near the shore is industrial. The area is traditionally an extension of Ngau Tau Kok, and thus facilities such as Ngau Tau Kok Police Station are located there.

==Governance==
Administratively, the reclamation of Kowloon Bay and water east of the runway except the airport area is part of Kwun Tong District. The airport and the waters of the district, on the other hand, belong to Kowloon City District.

==Geography==
Kowloon Bay has undergone massive reclamation over the past century. San Po Kong, which is now far from the coast, was reclaimed from the bay in the early days.

The western part of the bay is now protected from the sea by a breakwater, and forms the To Kwa Wan typhoon shelter. A small barrel rock, the Kowloon Rock, is in the typhoon shelter. Other barrel rocks, the Channel Rock and the Hoi Sham Island (also To Kwa Wan Island), are now connected to land at the former Kai Tak International Airport runway and at To Kwa Wan respectively, by land reclamation.

==Features==
The former Kai Tak International Airport was built on reclaimed land in Kowloon Bay and its one and only runway, which juts out into the bay, is surrounded by water on three sides. The airport was closed in 1998 and now a cruise terminal occupies a part of the site.

Kowloon Bay Depot, the first MTR depot, is located in the area.

==Buildings==
* Amoy Gardens, large private estate
* Electrical and Mechanical Services Department Headquarters
* Enterprise Square Five, a complex comprising MegaBox shopping mall and two office buildings
* Goldin Financial Global Centre, an office building
* Hong Kong Pacific Tower, a grade-A commercial building
* Kai Yip Estate, a public housing estate
* Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre (KITEC), an exhibition and convention centre which also hosts many concerts.
* Richland Gardens, a Private Sector Participation Scheme estate
* Skyline Tower 2, an office tower
* Billion Centre, an office building
* Telford Gardens, a private housing estate built on top of MTR&#x27;s Kowloon Bay station depot
* East Kowloon Cultural Centre, opening in 2024

==Economy==
Fung Seng Enterprises has its head office in Kowloon Bay.

==Education==
Schools and institutions are scarce in this district. The most famous ones include the SPACE of the University of Hong Kong, Town Center of City University of Hong Kong and YCH Law Chan Chor Si College.

Kowloon Bay is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 46. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money); no government primary schools are in this net.

==Schools==

* Kellett School
* Kowloon Bay St. John The Baptist Catholic Primary School

==Future==
In the 1990s, there were plans to convert the bay (reclaiming part or even the entire bay) and the former airport site into an in-city new town which would house 240 to 340 thousand residents and a sports stadium. The reduction in demand for land, environmental issues, and public outcry led to a revision of the project. The scheme would not comply with the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance. Hence, the Kai Tak Development plans do not include any land reclamation. A cruise terminal opened on the southern part of the runway.

==Transport==
The area is serviced by MTR Kowloon Bay station on the Kwun Tong line which is beside Telford Plaza, along with many bus routes along Kwun Tong Road.

The old airport Kai Tak Airport was located next to Kowloon Bay. The airport was closed in 1998 and the new one was opened on Chep Lap Kok.

<text>The Saab Toad, or Paddan in Swedish, was a development car Saab Automobile made in 1966 to test out the new chassis, drive train and engine for the Saab 99.

==Background==
On 2 April 1964, Gudmund&#x27;s day in Sweden, after several years of planning, the Saab board started Project Gudmund. This was a project to develop a new and larger car to replace the Saab 96. This new car became the Saab 99, designed by Sixten Sason, and unveiled in Stockholm on 22 November 1967.

==Overview==

The reason for this project was to preserve secrecy during development of the new model, the Saab 99, which was the company&#x27;s first radically new body shape since the first cars made in 1947. The Toad used the body of a Saab 96, which was long enough for the purpose but had to be widened by . This was achieved by cutting the body in half lengthwise and inserting 20 cm of steel spacer. The windscreen (windshield) and rear window clearly showed the seam.

The bonnet (hood) and grille required widening in a different way, to prevent changing the appearance of the centrally-placed features, as the picture shows. Under the bonnet, the inline four engine for the future Saab 99 was mounted, developed by Triumph in coordination with Saab.

It was rightly believed that the wider body would not be noticed on Sweden&#x27;s roads, where so many SAAB 96 cars were an everyday sight. This deception was successful, for a while, until test drivers allowed a grey Toad to be followed by a similarly-colored SAAB 96, making the different proportions obvious to any observer.

Four Saab Toads were made, but only one remains, in dark gray paintwork. It is currently on display in the SAAB museum in Trollhättan, Sweden.

==Post-Saab Toad==

Further development was carried out on the SAAB Daihatsu, a test car with the new body but badged &quot;Daihatsu&quot;, to prevent its identification by journalists as a developmental SAAB. This vehicle is on display in the SAAB Museum in Trollhättan.

<text>The Saab Monster was an experimental car made by Saab in 1959. This project was part of Saab&#x27;s work in motorsport and the need to derive more power from their two-stroke powerplant. 
==Design==
The project consisted of a &#x27;Toreador Red&#x27; Saab 93 with all excess weight removed, including the bonnet, which was replaced by a plastic one. The engineers then installed two transversely-mounted two-stroke, three cylinder engines, in a &#x27;split in-line&#x27; configuration, driving the front wheels through a modified clutch and gearbox assembly. The drivetrain also used two distributors and an enlarged radiator.

This arrangement gave the car about and a top speed of (achieved at Såtenäs airfield). 
The low weight and the &#x27;drop&#x27; or aerofoil shape of the body gave the rear end a tendency to become airborne when approaching the top speed. The amount of torque, coupled with front-wheel drive, also gave rise to severe understeer. It was the combination of immense power and poor handling that gave rise to the name &#x27;Monster&#x27;.

==History==
Started in 1959, this project was a part of Saab&#x27;s work in motorsport and the need to derive more power from their then-standard two-stroke powerplant.
During the project there was a speed record attempt but this was not recognised on account of discrepancies in scrutineering and recording. 
In the end, the project was terminated because it proved impractical.
The restored Saab Monster is now on display in the Saab museum in Trollhättan.

In the early 1970s Saab and Sportpromotion built a similar vehicle powered by two V4 engines giving .

<text>Government House, located on Government Hill in Central, Hong Kong, is the official residence of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. It was constructed in 1855 as a Colonial Renaissance-style building, but was significantly remodelled during the Japanese occupation, resulting in the current hybrid Japanese-neoclassical form.

Government House was the official residence of the Governor from 1855 to 1997, when the territory was under British rule. Of the 28 governors of Hong Kong, 25 have used this building as their official residence.
Located between Upper Albert Road and Lower Albert Road, Mid-Levels, Central, Government House is on a plot of land. Its front elevation faces south towards the Peak, while right below its northern part are the former Central Government Offices (currently the Justice Place).

Government House is a declared monument under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance.

== History/Timeline ==


Government House was designed by Charles St George Cleverly. Construction started in 1851, eight years after Hong Kong became a British colony, and took four years to complete. The first Governor to live there was Sir John Bowring, the fourth governor of the territory. The last to have was the last and 28th governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten.

Government House also housed the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1855 to the 1930s. The Council used the ballroom from 1891 onward.

During the Japanese occupation during the Second World War (1941–1945), it was occupied by the Japanese Military Governor. The form of the building was changed to a hybrid Japanese/neoclassical image by Seichi Fujimura (藤村正一 &quot;Fujimura Seiichi&quot;) in 1944, primarily through the addition of a tower and roof elements.

On 16 September 1945, the Instrument of Surrender was signed at the Government House.

The Japanese fittings of Government House were removed in 1946, but the tower remains to this day.

During 1947 to 1957, two sculptured stone lions were erected at the entrance.

During 1971 to 1982, a kidney-shaped swimming pool was built in the garden.

During 1982 to 1986, an ornamental pool with a fountain was created at the foot of the main stairs leading down from the north Veranda.

During 1987 to 1992, a small pergola on the lower terrace was erected and the water feature of the main garden staircase was converted into an impressive planter.

Government House was declared a monument in 1995 under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance.

After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997, the House became a reception for ceremonies (such as the conferring of Honours and formal banquets). Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive, did not reside in Government House but rather at Grenville House.

During 1997 to 2005, a bonsai gallery was introduced in the Veranda.

Donald Tsang, the second Chief Executive, moved into Government House in January 2006, following extensive renovations. &quot;The Standard&quot; criticised that the renovation cost was estimated at HK$14.5 million, including a sum of HK$300,000 allocated to a new fish pond designed to accommodate Tsang&#x27;s collection of koi.

During 2005 to 2012, an outdoor fish pond was added in the back garden.

During 2012 to 2017, three-bin composting system was added in the back garden.

In 2017, one of the tennis courts was converted into a Landscaped Area.

In 2022, HK$2.8 million was spent to renovate the house, before the fifth Chief Secretary John Lee moved in.

==Major features==
===Exterior===
The main entrance of the house faces south towards Victoria Peak. Down on the northern side is the Former Central Government Offices, where most government secretariat offices were situated until 2011.

The carriage porch at the front with granite frames is a notable architectural feature of Government House.

The exterior of Government House is plastered in Art Deco style. Government House has its unique character and historical meanings with a blend of different architectural styles added on over more than a century.

===Garden===
Government House has a front lawn and a back garden with dazzling flowers. Originally planted in 1919, the multi-coloured azaleas bloom every spring. There is also a rare species of tree, Brownea grandiceps (Rose of Venezuela), originating from South America and listed in the Register of Old and Valuable Trees of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. Seven metres tall, with a crown spread of nine metres, this tree has been maintained in superb condition by the dedicated horticultural staff. Indeed, there are many mature trees on the grounds. Among those trees stands the giant Litchi chinensis.

The garden also features a kidney-shaped swimming pool and an outdoor fish pond.

===Interior===
* Ballroom – The Ballroom is used for hosting banquets for guests from home and abroad. It is also the venue for the Honours and Awards Presentation Ceremony and various community engagement activities.
* Dining Room – The Dining Room is used for banquets of smaller scale for guests from home and abroad.
* Drawing Room – The Drawing Room is used for receiving guests and holding meetings. Its walls and ceilings are embellished with exquisite plaster mouldings.

=== Gate Lodges and Government House Guards ===
At the front entrance on Upper Albert Road, there are two buildings with an iron gate known as the Gate Lodges. Built in 1855, they are the oldest structures of Government House. They were designed by Surveyor General Charles St. George Cleverly who was in charge of the construction of the first generation of Government House in the 1850s. The lodges once housed the Government House Guards, who stood in front of the house and protected the Governor of Hong Kong. Various units of the British Army stationed in Hong Kong were used as guard units, which included:

* 1st Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment from 1962-63
* C Company of the 1st Battalion of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Regiment Berkshire and Wiltshire

Following the handover in 1997, the Hong Kong Police has taken up the guarding duties of the building.

== Open days ==
The garden of Government House is opened twice a year to the public. At least one will be arranged in spring to enable members of the public to share the delight in viewing the full bloom of the azaleas. Visitors are usually allowed to pass by the drawing room, dining room and ballroom where key official functions are held.

The open days are generally arranged during weekends. Dates are announced through press releases one week in advance. No admission fee is charged.

== Booking ==
The ballroom of Government House was made available in the 1990s on three Fridays each month for bookings by charitable, non-profit or public organisations to host events that benefit the community. The nature of the event under application must be well-matched with the identity of Government House as an important historical monument of Hong Kong and with its status as a dignified location for the Hong Kong Government to hold official functions. In early 2006, the chief executive moved into the Government House and used it as their official residence and office. Most of the staff in the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office were also relocated to the Government House to support the chief executive. Since then, the Government House was no longer available for booking due to security and operational reasons.

== Other official residences ==
In 1900, Mountain Lodge, on Victoria Peak, was built as an alternate summer home for the governor, a role it retained until 1934. The building survived until 1946, but today only the Gate Lodge and Victoria Peak Garden remain. One of three &quot;GOVERNOR&#x27;S RESIDENCE&quot; marking stones of the former Mountain Lodge was erected in the small flower bed in front of the entrance of the Government House in 1980.

From 1934, Fanling Lodge, in the New Territories, was used as a summer residence for the Governor. It has retained this role, and is now the alternative residence of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The Lodge is occupied mainly at weekends and on holidays.

== Feng shui ==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, alleged bad feng shui was the reason Tung Chee Hwa refused to live or work in Government House upon becoming Chief Executive.

&quot;The Standard&quot; believed Tung&#x27;s reason to stay away from the mansion was political: a subtle effort to reduce the age-old British legacy over Hong Kong. Other sources mention that &quot;it was the warning about spying devices [installed throughout Government House] that scared him away&quot;.

== Staff ==
There are 20 housekeeping positions at the Government House. The senior chef is paid around HK$30,000 per month.

<text>Generation Terrorists is the debut studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 10 February 1992 by Columbia Records.

On the back of significant media attention and a &quot;disproportionately high press profile&quot; generated by the band&#x27;s previously released single &quot;Motown Junk&quot; from 1991, &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; was long-awaited by critics thanks to the members&#x27; proclamation that their debut would be the &quot;greatest rock album ever&quot; and sell around sixteen million copies around the world, &quot;from Bangkok to Senegal&quot;. Recorded between July and December 1991 and released in February 1992, the album did not meet these sales figures but it was nonetheless ultimately certified Gold in the United Kingdom and also charted within the Top 100 in Japan.

== Recording ==

&quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; was recorded by tracking (the band recording each instrument separately rather than playing it as a live band and then adding the overdubs later) over a period of twenty-three weeks at Blackbarn Studios, near Guildford, England.

Producer Steve Brown decided not to use live drums on the album, and so most of the drum tracks were recorded with a drum machine, which was programmed by the band&#x27;s drummer Sean Moore.

===Musical style===
Describing the album&#x27;s musical style, &quot;the Quietus&quot; opined &quot;It had to sound passé, it had to be overdone; if you&#x27;re trying to bulldoze the shiny edifice of western pop culture, you can&#x27;t do it tastefully or with subtlety, can you? [...] &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; intentionally overplays its hand, overeggs its pudding and spunks its load at every turn&quot;. and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Joe Tangari wrote that &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; &quot;walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so obviously patterned after the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; that it was actually kind of cute.&quot; Critics have labelled the album as glam rock, hard rock, punk rock, glam punk and glam metal. Other influences on the album&#x27;s sound include Guns N&#x27; Roses and the New York Dolls.

=== Lyrical content ===

All lyrics were written by Richey Edwards and Nicky Wire. All music was written by James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore (except &quot;Damn Dog&quot;, which is a cover version of a song by the Sleez Sisters from the 1980 movie &quot;Times Square&quot;). The album&#x27;s lyrics are politicised similar to that of The Clash and Public Enemy, with the album&#x27;s songs regularly switching from a critical focus on global capitalism to more personal tales of despair and the struggles of youth. Examples of the more politically inspired side of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; include the opening track &quot;Slash &#x27;n&#x27; Burn&quot;, which concerns &quot;third world exploitation&quot;, the track &quot;Repeat (Stars and Stripes)&quot;, a remix of the band&#x27;s own anti-monarchy tirade by Public Enemy production team The Bomb Squad and &quot;Another Invented Disease&quot;, a song whose title was deliberate word play on AIDS and referred to a conspiracy theory insinuating that the virus was manufactured by American biological warfare scientists.

Other tracks combine personal and political themes, implicating a connection between global capitalism and personal struggle; &quot;Nat West-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds&quot; was written as a critique of overseas banking credit policies, but also concerned Richey Edwards&#x27; issues involving overdrafts and refused loans. Marc Burrows of Drowned in Sound considered the song to be an accurate prediction of &quot;global financial meltdown&quot; and its effects on everyday life. The single &quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot;, meanwhile, criticizes consumerism as a &quot;shallow dream&quot; that makes human life overtly commercialized. &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot;, a duet between Traci Lords and Bradfield, was described by Priya Elan of the &quot;NME&quot; as a &quot;perfect snapshot of [female] innocence bodysnatched and twisted&quot;.

Wire and Edwards&#x27; love of poetry is also evident in their lyrics. Stuart Maconie of &quot;Select&quot; speculated that the album&#x27;s lyrics were not primarily written for usage in song format: &quot;You got the impression that often they haven&#x27;t even been tried out in the mouth&quot;. Instead, revolutionary slogans, and rhyme-free verse conveying multiple messages combine to create an album &quot;drenched in Richey and Nicky&#x27;s cut-n-paste lyrical agitation&quot;, with vocalist Bradfield &quot;fitting sentences along the lines of &#x27;Nagasaki royal alienation consumer deathmask strychnine holocaust hate&#x27; into the restrictive confines of a melodic rock chorus.&quot;

=== Album cover ===

Edwards assumed responsibility for the cover; among ideas he had were using Andres Serrano&#x27;s &quot;Piss Christ&quot;, a Jesus figure inside a container of urine; the Bert Stern Marilyn Monroe photographs; a sandpaper sleeve that would scratch the album itself as well as anything else that it was shelved by (similar to &quot;Mémoires&quot; by Asger Jorn and Guy Debord); as well as several other famous religious paintings; but these suggestions were either declined or found too expensive.

The final front cover of the album was a picture of Edwards&#x27; left arm and chest. The arm had a tattoo of a rose with the words &quot;useless generation&quot; in capitals underneath, which was changed to &quot;generation terrorists&quot;. This was not without problems, as the original pressing had made Edwards&#x27; flesh to be bright pink as opposed to the intended mustard. The back cover featured a design similar to their earlier &quot;New Art Riot&quot; EP cover, an EC Flag, though this time it was crumpled and in flames. The working title of the album was &quot;Culture, Alienation, Boredom &amp; Despair&quot; (a lyric from the song &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot;).

== Release ==

&quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; was released on 10 February 1992. The album entered the UK Rock Chart at No. 1, selling around 250,000 copies worldwide initially. These sales coincided with the 1992 BRIT Awards, whose winners relegated &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; to a peak of No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart and has spent a total of 28 weeks in the top 100. Early pressings of the album contain a sample from &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; at the start of &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot;. It was removed from later pressings and does not appear on the legacy 20th anniversary edition of the album. The success of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; at the 1997 BRIT Awards ensured that sales of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; and subsequent albums &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; and &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; enjoyed a late surge; the band&#x27;s debut sold an extra 110,000 copies.

In the US, the track listing was changed, and some of the more political tracks were dropped. &quot;Democracy Coma&quot; was added to make up for this; it was later released as the B-side to &quot;Love&#x27;s Sweet Exile&quot;/&quot;Repeat&quot;, and also appeared on &quot;Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers)&quot;. In addition, four tracks on the US release (&quot;Slash &#x27;n&#x27; Burn&quot;, &quot;Nat West–Barclays–Midlands–Lloyds&quot;, &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot; and &quot;You Love Us&quot;) were remixed by Michael Brauer. These same four tracks also featured live drumming from American drummer Zachary Alford. These tracks were later included on the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; EP in Japan.

The album failed to chart in the United States, shifting only 35,000 units. Music journalist Simon Price suggested that this was because of the arrival of bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden as the &quot;new rock-megastar elite&quot;.

On 5 November 2012, &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; was re-released for its 20th anniversary. There are five editions of the re-release: the original album; a two-disc Deluxe Edition with a bonus disc of demos and a DVD of the documentary film &quot;Culture, Alienation, Boredom, Despair&quot;, about the making of the album – when purchased from the Rough Trade record store in London it also included a free ticket to a showing of the documentary film, followed by an acoustic gig with James Dean Bradfield on 6 November; a four-disc limited edition (3,000 copies worldwide), including, in addition to the contents of the two-disc edition, a replica of a &quot;Generation Terrorist&quot; tour VIP pass; a 10&quot; collage by Richey Edwards; a 10&quot; vinyl LP of a rare Manics radio performance; and a 28-page book from Nicky Wire&#x27;s personal archive.

== Reception ==
Soon after its release &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; was greeted with a favourable reception from magazines such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and RAW, along with a number 15 placing in the &quot;NME&quot; Albums of the Year list for 1992. Andy Gill, music critic for &quot;The Independent&quot;, highlighted in a review of the album&#x27;s 2012 reissue that the music was &quot;derided as sub-Clash&quot; in other contemporary appraisals, but remarked that it &quot;now has an astringent edge&quot;. The album&#x27;s length and lack of &quot;quality control&quot; were common criticisms. Richey Edwards said that &quot;everybody knows the first album would have been better if we&#x27;d left out all the crap.&quot; The underproduction of the album was a common cause of complaint among the band&#x27;s adherents until the superior mix of the Anniversary Edition in 2012.

Nevertheless, by 2012 critics&#x27; perception of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; had remained generally positive. In their retrospective review of the album, &quot;The Quietus&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; should be celebrated, because among its messy feast of ideas it remembers to be fun. There&#x27;s a cleansing and creative glee in its righteous rage and cultural destruction that&#x27;s rarer in &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; and &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;.&quot; AllMusic wrote, &quot;Since the Manics deliver these charged lyrics as heavy guitar-rockers, the music doesn&#x27;t always hit quite as forcefully as intended&quot;, stating that the &quot;relatively polished production and big guitar sound occasionally sell the music short, especially the lesser songs&quot;, but calling the band&#x27;s passion &quot;undeniable, even on the weaker cuts [...] Debut albums rarely come as ambitious as the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; listed &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; as the 18th greatest debut album from the last 50 years, describing the record as &quot;angry as it was bright, the Manics blowtorched their manifesto in pulverising punk guitar squeals.&quot; In a 2012 &quot;In Depth&quot; feature, Dom Gourlay of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; declared &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; to be the most important debut of the 1990s. In a February 2011 issue of &quot;Q&quot; it was voted by readers at #77 in &quot;The 250 Best Albums of Q&#x27;s Lifetime&quot; featuring albums between 1986 and 2011. The same magazine gave the record the award for Classic album in the Q Awards in 2012.

<text>The City of Victoria, (, or ) often called Victoria City or simply Victoria (), was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Hong Kong during its time as a British dependent territory. It was initially named Queenstown but was soon known as Victoria. It was one of the first urban settlements in Hong Kong and its boundaries are recorded in the Laws of Hong Kong. All government bureaux and many key departments still have their head offices located within its limit.

Present-day Central is at the heart of Victoria City. Although the city expanded over much of what is now Kennedy Town, Shek Tong Tsui, Lung Fu Shan, Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Wan Chai, Happy Valley, the Mid-Levels, East Point and parts of Causeway Bay, the name &quot;Victoria&quot; has been eclipsed by &quot;Central&quot; in popular usage. However, the name is still used in places such as Victoria Park, Victoria Peak, Victoria Harbour, Victoria Prison, and a number of roads and streets. It is also retained in the names of various organisations such as the Victoria City District of the Hong Kong Scout, and the Victoria Junior Chamber. The name Victoria District Court had been used into the 1980s, when it was moved to the Wanchai Tower and combined with other district courts in the territory.

==History==
&quot;City of Victoria&quot; had appeared on the statute books early in the 1845, although names such as &quot;Town of Victoria&quot; can be found as well. Letters patent that formally confers the city status and creates the City of Victoria was made on 11 May 1849.

In 1857, the British government expanded the scope of Victoria City and divided it into four &quot;wans&quot; ():

* &quot;Sai Wan&quot; ( &#x27;West Ring&#x27;, present-day Sai Wan, including Kennedy Town, Shek Tong Tsui, and Sai Ying Pun)
* &quot;Sheung Wan&quot; (&#x27;Upper Ring&#x27;, present-day Sheung Wan)
* &quot;Choong Wan&quot; or &quot;Chung Wan&quot; (&#x27;Central Ring&#x27;, present-day Central)
* &quot;Ha Wan&quot; (&quot;Lower Ring&quot;, present-day Wan Chai). 

&quot;Sai Wan&quot;, &quot;Sheung Wan&quot; and &quot;Choong Wan&quot; retain the same Chinese name today. The four &quot;wans&quot; are further divided into nine &quot;yeuks&quot; (, similar to &#x27;district&#x27; or &#x27;neighbourhood&#x27;). The coverage also included parts of East Point and Happy Valley (west of Wong Nai Chung Road on the east side of the racecourse). In 1903, boundary stones were established to mark the city&#x27;s boundary and six of them are still preserved today. The stones spread from Causeway Bay to Kennedy Town.

In the 1890s, Victoria extended four miles west to east along the coastal strip. Buildings were made of granite and brick. Buses and the new tramway would become the main form of transportation in the area.

The city is centred in present-day Central, and named after Queen Victoria in 1843. It occupies the areas known in modern times as Central, Admiralty, Sheung Wan, Wan Chai, East Point, Shek Tong Tsui, the Mid-levels, the Peak, Happy Valley, Tin Hau, and Kennedy Town, on Hong Kong Island.

==Boundaries==

The city boundaries are defined in the laws of Hong Kong as follows:

*On the north – The Harbour;
*On the west – A line running due north and south drawn through the north-west angle of Inland Lot No. 1299 and extending southwards a distance of 850 feet from the aforesaid angle;
*On the south – A line running due east from the southern extremity of the western boundary until it meets a contour in the vicinity of the Hill above Belchers 700 feet above principal datum, that is to say, a level 17.833 feet below the bench-mark known as &quot;Rifleman&#x27;s Bolt&quot;, the highest point of a copper bolt set horizontally in the east wall of the Royal Navy Office and Mess Block Naval Dockyard, and thence following the said contour until it meets the eastern boundary;
*On the east – A line following the west side of the Government Pier, Bay View and thence along the west side of , then along the north side of Causeway Road to . Thence along the west side of Moreton Terrace to the south-east corner of Inland Lot No. 1580 and produced in a straight line for 80 feet, and thence along the north side of Cotton Path and produced until it meets the west side of Wong Nei Chong Road on the east side of Wong Nei Chong Valley and thence to the south-east angle of Inland Lot No. 1364, produced until it meets the southern boundary.

== First streets ==
According to the 1845 map of Victoria City, 16 streets were initially named for the city. These streets exist mainly in the areas of Central and the Mid-Levels, with two being in Sheung Wan. These street names were finalised by the second Governor of Hong Kong, Sir John Francis Davis. All 16 streets were named after persons of great prominence in Great Britain or in Hong Kong, with the location and layout determined according to the position and prominence of the eponymous person:
== Boundary stones ==

In 1903, the Hong Kong Government erected several boundary stones to mark the limits of Victoria, measuring 98 cm in height, tapered at the top and with the inscription &quot;City Boundary 1903&quot;. As the city’s boundaries were clearly defined by ordinance, these stones were more just physical markers.

Three additional boundary stones were found in 2021, adding the total of discovered stones to 10, including the one disappeared in June 2007.
==Districts==

In 1866 the nine districts, also called &quot;yeuks&quot;, are:

* Shek Tong Tsui
* Sai Ying Pun
* Taipingshan, a neighborhood near Sheung Wan that shared its name with Victoria Peak
* Sheong Wan
* Choong Wan North and South, known in modern times as Central in English
* Ha Wan, today&#x27;s Admiralty and Wan Chai
* Wan Chai
* Bowrington, between today&#x27;s Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, known also as Ngo Keng
* So Kun Poo.

Other places that might be considered as &quot;yeuks&quot; include:
*Kennedy Town
*Happy Valley
*Causeway Bay

==Territorial designation==
On 21 May 1982, Sir Crawford Murray MacLehose was made a life peer, weeks after the end of his governorship in Hong Kong. His peerage was announced on 31 December 1981 in the 1982 New Years Honours. He was therefore styled as Baron MacLehose of Beoch, of Maybole in the District of Kyle and Carrick, and of Victoria in Hong Kong. Victoria was listed as the barony&#x27;s territorial designation, alongside MacLehose&#x27;s hometown Maybole. The Barony went extinct on 27 May 2000 when MacLehose passed away.

<doc id="393356" wikidata="Q1372014" url="?curid=393356" title="HSBC Building (Hong Kong)">
<text>HSBC Main Building is a headquarters building of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which is today a wholly owned subsidiary of London-based HSBC Holdings. It is located on the southern side of Statue Square near the location of the old City Hall, Hong Kong (built in 1869, demolished in 1933). The previous HSBC building was built in 1935 and pulled down to make way for the current building. The address remains as 1 Queen&#x27;s Road Central (the north facing side of the building was served by Des Voeux Road Central, which was the seashore, making Queen&#x27;s Road the main entrance, in contrast to the current primary access coming from Des Voeux Road).

==History==
===First building===
The first HSBC (then known as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company Limited) building was Wardley House, used as an HSBC office between 1865 and 1882 on the present site. In 1864 the lease cost HKD 500 a month. After raising a capital of HKD 5 million, the bank opened its doors in 1865.

===Second building===
Wardley House was subsequently demolished and replaced by a second HSBC building that was completed in 1886. The main feature of the second building design was the division of the structure into two almost separate buildings. The building on Queen&#x27;s Road Central was in Victorian style with a verandah, colonnades and an octagonal dome, whereas an arcade which harmonised with the adjacent buildings was constructed on Des Voeux Road. It was designed by Clement Palmer in 1883.

===Third building===
In 1934, the second building was demolished and a third design was erected. The new building opened in October 1935. Upon completion, the building stood as the tallest building in Hong Kong and &quot;the largest building in the Far East&quot;, &quot;the tallest structure in South East Asia&quot;, and &quot;tallest building between Cairo and San Francisco&quot;. The third design used part of the land of the old City Hall, and was built in a mixed Art Deco and Stripped Classical style. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong between 1941 and 1945, the building served as the government headquarters. It was the first building in Asia to be fully air-conditioned. By the 1970s, the bank had outgrown its headquarters; departments were scattered into offices all over Central, and it was obvious that such a &quot;solution&quot; to the space limitations could not continue indefinitely. In 1978, the bank decided to replace it with a new building intended to symbolize the bank’s modernization and the city’s increasing prominence in global finance. Construction began in 1981 and concluded in 1985.

===Current building===
The current building is a steel suspended structure designed by Norman Foster, was finished on 18 November 1985. At the time, it was the most expensive building in the world (c.a. HK$5.2 billion, roughly US$668 million). The decision to replace the previous headquarters marked the bank&#x27;s goals for modernization and role in growth as a financial center.

The first major addition to the building, designed by Hong Kong&#x27;s One Space Ltd, was completed on 23 November 2006, in the form of a ground floor lobby that improves security access to the upper floors and creates a prestigious reception area. Its design and construction included the installation of the &quot;Asian Story Wall&quot;, a multimedia installation consisting of twin banks of 30 seamless plasma screens (the largest installation of its kind in Hong Kong) displaying archived bank heritage and artworks.

The atrium of the HSBC building was the site of the Occupy Hong Kong protests which maintained a presence in the building from 15 October 2011 until their eviction in September 2012.

==Design==
The new building was designed by the British architect Norman Foster and civil &amp; structural engineers Ove Arup &amp; Partners with service design by J. Roger Preston &amp; Partners. It was constructed by the John Lok / Wimpey Joint Venture. From the concept to completion, it took seven years (1978–1985). The building is 180 metres high with 47 storeys and four basement levels. The building has a modular design consisting of five steel modules, which were prefabricated in the UK by Scott Lithgow Shipbuilders near Glasgow and shipped to Hong Kong. About 30,000 tons of steel and 4,500 tons of aluminium were used.

The HSBC Building is an example of high-tech architecture, with its modular design allowing for rapid on-site assembly. This approach enabled large open interior spaces and aligned with the principles of high-tech design, emphasizing exposed systems and functionality.

The original design was heavily inspired by the Douglas Gilling designed Qantas International Centre in Sydney (currently known as Suncorp Place).

The new lobby and its two-part Asian Story Wall were designed by Greg Pearce, of One Space Limited. Pearce was also the Principal Architect of the Hong Kong Airport Express (MTR) station. Conceived as a minimalist glass envelope, the new lobby is designed to be deferential to Foster&#x27;s structure and appears almost to be part of the original.

The building was designed to not have lifts as the primary carrier of building traffic. The lifts only stop every few floors at atriums, groups of floors which are divided for specific functions. The floors are interconnected by escalators. The goal of this design is to add a social dimension and social flow to each floor, allowing for conversations to occur between floors and creating &quot;a village in the sky&quot;. This was to shift away from the social isolation of each floor which is present with central lift systems.

=== Structural features ===

The main characteristic of HSBC&#x27;s Hong Kong headquarters is its absence of internal supporting structure. The inverted &#x27;va&#x27; segments of the suspension trusses spanning the construction at double-height levels is the most obvious characteristic of the building. It consists of eight groups of four aluminium-clad steel columns which ascend from the foundations up through the core structure, and five levels of triangular suspension trusses which are locked into these masts.

A corrosion protection system is present because of Hong Kong&#x27;s hot and humid climate. It introduces cementitious barrier coating, this process uses a special cement blend which takes humidity and increases corrosion protection rather than corroding the cladding and steel.

All flooring is made from lightweight movable panels, under which lies a comprehensive network of power, telecommunication, and air-conditioning systems. This design was to allow equipment such as computer terminals to be installed quickly and easily. Because of the urgency to finish the project, the construction of the building relied heavily on off-site prefabrication; components were manufactured all over the world. For example, the structural steel came from Britain; the glass, aluminium cladding and flooring came from the United States while the service modules came from Japan.

=== Environmental Features ===
A notable feature is that natural sunlight is the major source of lighting inside the building. There is a mirror system at the top of the atrium, which reflects natural sunlight into the building. Through the use of natural sunlight, this design helps to conserve energy and reduces energy consumption.The sun shades are provided on the external facades to block direct sunlight going into the building and to reduce heat gain.The building’s cooling system relies on seawater rather than fresh water, a solution that minimizes environmental impact in the coastal city of Hong Kong. These features, integrated seamlessly into the high-tech design and sustainable architecture.

The building was also designed to comply with safety regulations concerning typhoons and ability to shelter the public plaza on the ground floor level.

== Cultural and symbolic context ==

The HSBC Building is more than a functional headquarters; it is a symbol of Hong Kong’s role as a financial powerhouse. The building’s design was intended to convey openness and innovation, aligning with the city’s rapid modernization in the 1980s. Its prominent location on Statue Square and its alignment with Victoria Harbour reflect its integration into Hong Kong’s cultural and urban identity. Today, the building remains an architectural representation of the city’s global financial influence.

==Feng shui==

The early British settlers in Hong Kong had an interest in feng shui; thus, most of the earliest buildings in Hong Kong, and many buildings constructed thereafter, were built with the philosophies of feng shui in mind. The Chinese believe that those who have a direct view of a body of water—whether it is a river, a sea, or an ocean—are more likely to prosper than those who do not (water is strongly associated with wealth in feng shui). The HSBC building has a wide open area (the Statue Square) in front of it, with no other buildings blocking its view of Victoria Harbour; thus, it is considered to have &quot;good feng shui&quot;.

In the CBC Television series Doc Zone episode &quot;Superstitious Minds&quot;, Writer, Researcher &amp; Associate Producer Tom Puchniak asserts that the design of the nearby Bank of China Tower ignored feng shui principles, and created instant controversy by evoking two knife edges, one pointing towards the British Government House, another towards the HSBC building. After the Bank of China building opened, a series of mishaps occurred, including the death of the Governor, and a downturn in the city&#x27;s economy. It is alleged that HSBC installed two maintenance cranes on the roof, pointing directly at the Bank of China, to defend against the negative energy from the Bank of China building. According to feng shui master Paul Hung, this solved the problem, and HSBC experienced &quot;no harmful results after that.&quot;

==Lion statues==
When HSBC decided to build its third headquarters at 1 Queen&#x27;s Road Central, opened in 1935, it commissioned two bronze lions from Shanghai-based British sculptor W. W. Wagstaff. This commission was inspired by two earlier lions that had been ordered for the new Shanghai office opened in 1923. Cast by J W Singer &amp; Sons in the English town of Frome, to a design by Henry Poole RA, these lions had quickly become part of the Shanghai scene, and passers-by would affectionately stroke the lions in the belief that power and money would rub off on them. They became known as Stephen and Stitt: Stephen was named for A. G. Stephen, the Chief Manager of HSBC in 1923, and G. H. Stitt, the then Shanghai Manager. Stephen is depicted roaring and Stitt is at rest, which was said to represent the characters of these two famous bankers.

Like the Shanghai lions, the Hong Kong lions became objects of veneration, and foci of the Bank&#x27;s perceived excellent feng shui. People are known to still bring their children to stroke the paws and noses of the statues hoping for luck and prosperity.

During World War 2, the lions were confiscated by the Japanese and sent to Japan to be melted down. The war ended before this could happen, and the lions were recognised by an American sailor in a dockyard in Osaka in 1945. They were returned a few months later and restored to their original positions in October 1946.

During the demolition of the building in 1981, the lions were temporarily moved to Statue Square, opposite the main entrance. As a mark of the respect the lions were held in, the move to Statue Square and the move back in 1985 were accompanied by the chairman Sir Michael Sandberg and senior management of the Bank. The placement of the lions both temporarily and in their current locations was made only after extensive consultations with feng shui practitioners.

The lion named Stephen has shrapnel scars in its left hind-quarters dating from the fighting in the Battle of Hong Kong. When this pair of lions was used as the model for the pair commissioned for the new UK Headquarters of HSBC in 2002, Zambian-born New Zealand sculptor Mark Kennedy was asked not to reproduce these &quot;war wounds&quot; in the copies as the shrapnel marks were seen as historical battle-scars.

The following is a list of bronze copies and re-casts of the HSBC lions:
* In Hong Kong:
** Hong Kong (1935) – modelled on Shanghai originals; sculpted by W W Wagstaff, cast by Shanghai Arts and Crafts.
**Hong Kong (replicas) (2015) – copies of Hong Kong lions; for the celebration of the 150th anniversary of HSBC; placed at the lobby of HSBC Centre, HSBC&#x27;s back office headquarter in Hong Kong.
* In China:
** Shanghai (original) (1923) – sculpted by Henry Poole RA, cast by J W Stinger &amp; Sons. The originals are held by the Shanghai Historic Museum (which currently has no permanent home) and are separately on display at the Museum&#x27;s display room under the Oriental Pearl Tower (Stephen) and the Shanghai Banking Museum (Stitt), both in Lujiazui.
** Shanghai (replicas) (c. 1997) – copies of Shanghai originals, commissioned by the government-owned Shanghai Pudong Development Bank after it obtained the former HSBC building.
** Shanghai (current) (2010) – copies of Hong Kong lions.
* In the United Kingdom
**London (2001) – copies of Hong Kong lions; cast by Bronze Age Foundry, Limehouse, at the direction of Mark Kennedy.
**Birmingham (2018) – copies of Hong Kong lions.

Various other HSBC branches throughout the world feature small-scaled replicas of these originals, with varying degrees of faithfulness. Other HSBC branches often feature guardian lions to different designs, such as Chinese guardian lions.

==Lighting scheme==
In 2003, the Hong Kong Tourism Board developed a harbour lighting plan called &quot;A Symphony of Lights&quot;, a large-scale multimedia show featuring lighting, laser, music, and occasionally special pyrotechnics effects during festivals, to promote tourism in Hong Kong. The show was based on the illumination of key buildings on the Hong Kong Island side, and was best viewed from the Kowloon side across the Victoria Harbour. The HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building was one of the participating buildings in the show.

<doc id="393359" wikidata="Q831092" url="?curid=393359" title="Beth number">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in set theory, the beth numbers are a certain sequence of infinite cardinal numbers (also known as transfinite numbers), conventionally written formula_1, where formula_2 is the Hebrew letter beth. The beth numbers are related to the aleph numbers (formula_3), but unless the generalized continuum hypothesis is true, there are numbers indexed by formula_4 that are not indexed by formula_2.

== Definition ==
Beth numbers are defined by transfinite recursion:

* formula_6
* formula_7
* formula_8

where formula_9 is an ordinal and formula_10 is a limit ordinal.

The cardinal formula_11 is the cardinality of any countably infinite set such as the set formula_12 of natural numbers, so that formula_13.

Let formula_9 be an ordinal, and formula_15 be a set with cardinality formula_16. Then, 

* formula_17 denotes the power set of formula_15 (i.e., the set of all subsets of formula_15), 

* the set formula_20 denotes the set of all functions from formula_15 to formula_22,

* the cardinal formula_23 is the result of cardinal exponentiation, and

* formula_24 is the cardinality of the power set of formula_15.

Given this definition,

:formula_1

are respectively the cardinalities of

:formula_27

so that the second beth number formula_28 is equal to formula_29, the cardinality of the continuum (the cardinality of the set of the real numbers), and the third beth number formula_30 is the cardinality of the power set of the continuum.

Because of Cantor&#x27;s theorem, each set in the preceding sequence has cardinality strictly greater than the one preceding it. For infinite limit ordinals formula_10, the corresponding beth number is defined to be the supremum of the beth numbers for all ordinals strictly smaller than formula_10:

:formula_33

One can show that this definition is equivalent to

:formula_34

For instance:

*formula_35 is the cardinality of formula_36.
*formula_37 is the cardinality of formula_38.
*formula_39 is the cardinality of formula_40 formula_41.

This equivalence can be shown by seeing that:

*for any set formula_42, the union set of all its members can be no larger than the supremum of its member cardinalities times its own cardinality, formula_43
*for any two non-zero cardinalities formula_44, if at least one of them is an infinite cardinality, then the product will be the larger of the two, formula_45
*the set formula_46 will be smaller than most or all of its subsets for any limit ordinal formula_10
*therefore, formula_48 for any limit ordinal formula_10

Note that this behavior is different from that of successor ordinals. Cardinalities less than formula_50 but greater than any formula_51 can exist when formula_52 is a successor ordinal (in that case, the existence is undecidable in ZFC and controlled by the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis); but cannot exist when formula_52 is a limit ordinal, even under the second definition presented.

One can also show that the von Neumann universes formula_54 have cardinality formula_55.

== Relation to the aleph numbers ==
Assuming the axiom of choice, infinite cardinalities are linearly ordered; no two cardinalities can fail to be comparable. Thus, since by definition no infinite cardinalities are between formula_56 and formula_57, it follows that 
:formula_58
Repeating this argument (see transfinite induction) yields 
formula_59 
for all ordinals formula_9.

The continuum hypothesis is equivalent to
:formula_61

The generalized continuum hypothesis says the sequence of beth numbers thus defined is the same as the sequence of aleph numbers, i.e., 
formula_62 
for all ordinals formula_9.

== Specific cardinals ==

=== Beth null ===
Since this is defined to be formula_56, or aleph null, sets with cardinality formula_65 include:

* the natural numbers formula_12
* the rational numbers formula_67
* the algebraic numbers formula_68
* the computable numbers and computable sets
* the set of finite sets of integers or of rationals or of algebraic numbers
* the set of finite multisets of integers
* the set of finite sequences of integers.

=== Beth one ===

Sets with cardinality formula_28 include:

* the transcendental numbers
* the irrational numbers
* the real numbers formula_70
* the complex numbers formula_71
* the uncomputable real numbers
* Euclidean space formula_72
* the power set of the natural numbers formula_73 (the set of all subsets of the natural numbers)
* the set of sequences of integers (i.e., formula_74, which includes all functions from formula_12 to formula_76)
* the set of sequences of real numbers, formula_77 
* the set of all real analytic functions from formula_70 to formula_70
* the set of all continuous functions from formula_70 to formula_70
* the set of all functions from formula_70 to formula_70 with at most countable discontinuities 
*the set of finite subsets of real numbers
*the set of all analytic functions from formula_71 to formula_71 (the holomorphic functions)
*the set of all functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers (formula_86).

=== Beth two ===
formula_30 (pronounced &quot;beth two&quot;) is also referred to as formula_88 (pronounced &quot;two to the power of formula_29&quot;).

Sets with cardinality formula_30 include:

* the power set of the set of real numbers, so it is the number of subsets of the real line, or the number of sets of real numbers
* the power set of the power set of the set of natural numbers
* the set of all functions from formula_70 to formula_70 (formula_93)
* the set of all functions from formula_94 to formula_72
* the set of all functions from formula_70 to formula_70 with uncountably many discontinuities 
* the power set of the set of all functions from the set of natural numbers to itself, or the number of sets of sequences of natural numbers
* the Stone–Čech compactifications of formula_70, formula_67, and formula_12
* the set of deterministic fractals in formula_72 
* the set of random fractals in formula_72.

=== Beth omega ===
formula_35 (pronounced &quot;beth omega&quot;) is the smallest uncountable strong limit cardinal.

==Generalization==
The more general symbol formula_104, for ordinals formula_9 and cardinals formula_106, is occasionally used. It is defined by:
:formula_107
:formula_108
:formula_109 if &quot;λ&quot; is a limit ordinal.

So
:formula_110

In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF), for any cardinals formula_106 and formula_112, there is an ordinal formula_9 such that:

:formula_114

And in ZF, for any cardinal formula_106 and ordinals formula_9 and formula_52:

:formula_118

Consequently, in ZF absent ur-elements, with or without the axiom of choice, for any cardinals formula_106 and formula_112, the equality

:formula_121

holds for all sufficiently large ordinals formula_52. That is, there is an ordinal formula_9 such that the equality holds for every ordinal formula_124.

This also holds in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with ur-elements (with or without the axiom of choice), provided that the ur-elements form a set which is equinumerous with a pure set (a set whose transitive closure contains no ur-elements). If the axiom of choice holds, then any set of ur-elements is equinumerous with a pure set.

== Borel determinacy ==

Borel determinacy is implied by the existence of all beths of countable index.

<text>The Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building is the headquarters building of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison, located on Lung Wui Road, Admiralty, Hong Kong. It houses the Central Barracks.

It is a 113-metre (371 ft) tall, 28-floor building located within the former naval base. The former name of the building was the Prince of Wales Building ().

==History==
Constructed in 1979, the building was named the Prince of Wales Building. It housed the head office of the Royal Navy stationed in Hong Kong until the territory&#x27;s handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 July 1997 when it was made the head office of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison. In May 2000, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong passed the Military Installations Closed Areas (Amendment) Order 2000, which renamed the former &quot;Prince of Wales Barracks&quot; to &quot;Central Barracks&quot;, and the Prince of Wales Building to the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building. After the base became the Central Barracks, the old name of the building remained visible in large raised letters along the bottom of the tower for several years. The building underwent a 20-month full renovation, completed in 2014, during which most of the troops were transferred to the Stonecutters Island base.

Due to its distinctive shape, likened to a wineglass, the building stands out from the rest of the Admiralty waterfront buildings. Architects attribute the shape of the building to passive protection, its narrow stem with the protruding upper storeys, supposedly makes it difficult to climb or attack. It is also informally known as &#x27;the upside-down Gin bottle&#x27; due to its shape resembling a bottle of Gordon&#x27;s Gin. The corner of the building at the podium level which faces east (towards Admiralty MTR station) used to be a chapel under British use of the barracks. There used to be a crucifix visible on the exterior—however, during external refurbishment (including replacing the &#x27;Prince of Wales Building&#x27; inscription in English with its current name in Chinese) in 2001, the cross was removed. This was despite initial claims the cross would be retained.

== People&#x27;s Liberation Army in Hong Kong ==

The PLA maintains a number of garrisons in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In addition to the PLA Forces Hong Kong Building, there are notable garrisons at the Stonecutters Island, and at Stanley Fort. Soldiers located at these three garrisons are considered to be the élite of the PLA. The soldiers are not permitted to leave their compounds, even during off-duty times to mingle with the local populace. As a restricted area, the PLA Forces Hong Kong Building is heavily guarded by soldiers with automatic rifles.
