<text>Peter Eric James Prentice (July 20, 1956 – October 13, 2016) was a Canadian politician who served as the 16th premier of Alberta from 2014 to 2015. In the 2004 federal election he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was re-elected in the 2006 federal election and appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians. Prentice was appointed Minister of Industry on August 14, 2007, and after the 2008 election became Minister of Environment on October 30, 2008. On November 4, 2010, Prentice announced his resignation from cabinet and as MP for Calgary Centre-North. After retiring from federal politics he entered the private sector as vice-chairman of CIBC.

Prentice entered provincial politics in his home province of Alberta, and ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta to replace Dave Hancock, who was serving as interim Premier and party leader after Alison Redford&#x27;s resignation. On September 6, 2014, Prentice won the leadership election, becoming both the leader of the Progressive Conservatives and as such the Premier, as his party held a majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.
As Premier of Alberta, Prentice formed a new cabinet consisting of some members from the previous government, but also new Ministers including two who did not hold seats in the Legislature—Stephen Mandel and Gordon Dirks. All three stood as candidates in by-elections scheduled for October 27, 2014, and all three were elected with Prentice becoming the MLA for Calgary-Foothills. After introducing his first budget in 2015, Prentice declared an early provincial election on May 5, 2015. In the election, Prentice&#x27;s PCs suffered an unprecedented defeat, dropping to third place in the legislature with just 10 seats – ending 44 years of Tory rule in Alberta, the longest consecutive reign for any political party at the provincial level in Canada. Despite winning re-election in Calgary-Foothills, on election night Prentice resigned as both PC leader and MLA and retired from politics after results indicated that the Alberta NDP had won a majority government.

On October 13, 2016, Prentice and three others were killed when the aircraft in which they were travelling crashed shortly after taking off from Kelowna, British Columbia. The flight was en route from Kelowna to Springbank Airport, just outside Calgary.

==Background==
Prentice was born to a large, blue-collar family in South Porcupine, near Timmins, Ontario. The family then moved to Alberta in 1969. He was the son of Wilma Lyle Marea (Mawhiney) and Eric Prentice, a professional hockey player who played five games in the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1940s. His uncle Dean Prentice played in the NHL for more than 20 years. Prentice was educated at the University of Alberta (where he became a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity) and Dalhousie University. He paid for his tuition by working as a coal miner in the summer months for seven years.

As a lawyer, he served as a Law Commissioner of the Indian Claims Commission of Canada.

In his personal life, Prentice served for seven years on the Board of Directors at the Calgary Winter Club, including stints as president and Chairman. He was an active member and volunteer leader in the Grace Presbyterian Church. Prentice and his wife Karen have three daughters and two grandchildren.

He was also a member of the Trilateral Commission, a non-partisan organization that aims to increase cooperation within the developed world. In this capacity, Prentice was one of 20 Canadian members.

==Early political career==
Prentice joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1976, and was active in Tory circles ever since. In the 1986 provincial election, Prentice ran for the Progressive Conservatives in Calgary Mountain View, being defeated by NDP candidate Bob Hawkesworth.

During the early 1990s, Prentice served as the governing federal PC party&#x27;s chief financial officer and treasurer (1990–93). Prentice first ran for Parliament as the nominated Progressive Conservative candidate in a spring 2002 by-election in the riding of Calgary Southwest that followed the retirement of Preston Manning as the riding&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP). When newly elected Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper replaced nominated CA candidate Ezra Levant in the by-election, Prentice withdrew from the race, following common practice to allow a party leader to win a seat uncontested so they may lead their party within Parliament.

He ran in the 2003 Progressive Conservative leadership election to support the &quot;United Alternative&quot; proposal to merge the PC party with the Canadian Alliance. He was seen by many as an alternative to the &quot;status quo&quot; candidate and front runner Peter MacKay. A basic platform of Prentice&#x27;s campaign was that &quot;no one has ever defeated the Liberals with a divided conservative family.&quot; Prentice entered the 2003 convention day with some momentum, after delivering a passionate speech to the assembled delegates that encouraged Tories to be proud of their accomplishments, despite recent setbacks, and that recalled the sacrifices of Canadian soldiers who fought in the Battle of Passchendaele. He also unexpectedly received the support of fellow leadership challenger Craig Chandler, who withdrew early. Prentice ultimately emerged in second-place on the fourth ballot to the eventual winner MacKay. Consistent with his positions during the leadership race, Prentice was a supporter of the merger endorsed by both the CA and PC parties in December 2003 that formed the new Conservative Party of Canada.

Prentice was the first declared candidate for the leadership of the new Conservative Party, announcing his run on December 7, 2003, the day after the new party was ratified by members of the PC Party. Prentice began his campaign in Calgary and toured parts of Ontario, specifically visiting Kingston, Ontario, the hometown of the first conservative leader Sir John A. Macdonald. However, he withdrew from the race on January 12, 2004, citing difficulty in raising new funds less than a year after his unsuccessful first leadership bid. The leadership election was won by Stephen Harper, who later became Prime Minister of Canada after the 2006 Canadian federal election.

==Early parliamentary career==
Prentice ran in the riding of Calgary Centre-North in the 2004 election for the new Conservative Party, and won the seat with 54% of the popular vote.

After being sworn in as the MP for Calgary Centre North on July 16, Conservative Party Leader Stephen Harper named Prentice to the Shadow Cabinet as the Official Opposition Critic for Indian and Northern Affairs. In that role Prentice opposed the Tli Cho land claim agreement, which he said would make Canadian law secondary to Tlicho local law. Prentice was also a strong supporter of the proposed and controversial Mackenzie Valley pipeline. He criticized the Liberal government for its treatment of aboriginal women, and its alleged costs of administering the Residential School Claims program for aboriginal victims of abuse.

Prentice described himself as a Red Tory in the Conservative Party and surprised many observers when he voted in favour of Bill C-38 supporting same-sex marriage.

==Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development==
Prentice had been assigned the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development in the Conservative government, and was sworn into this role on February 6, 2006, until August 13, 2007. One of his main challenges as Minister was to implement &quot;The Nunavut Project,&quot; a 2006 report authored by Thomas Berger, to show tangible, measurable results to increase Inuit representation in the Nunavut public services.

===Kelowna Accord and residential schools===
In the fall of 2006, Phil Fontaine, National chief of the Assembly of First Nations, expressed disappointment over the Conservative government&#x27;s refusal to honour the Kelowna Accord, endorsed by 14 jurisdictions (the federal government, 10 provinces, and three territories). Fontaine previously described the federal government&#x27;s point person on Kelowna, Jim Prentice, as an &quot;honourable&quot; person sensitive to native concerns. Prior to January 2006 election, Fontaine and two vice-chiefs of the Assembly of First Nations had a meeting with Prentice. &quot;[Prentice] acknowledged all the hard work that went into Kelowna and (said) that the Conservative party would not put this aside,&quot; says Fontaine. &quot;We took him at his word.&quot; Prentice did not recall saying that: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been very, very careful about what I&#x27;ve said about Kelowna,&quot; According to Fontaine, in their first meeting after the 2006 election, &quot;(Prentice) wanted to apply a very focused approach to his responsibilities.&quot; In the federal budget of May 2006, Fontaine and other native leaders got a glimpse of what &quot;focused&quot; meant: just $450 million (over two years) was committed to implementing Kelowna, not the $1.64 billion for the first two years that Paul Martin had agreed to.

Prentice argued that there was actually $3.7 billion in spending on native peoples in the May 2006 budget, &quot;more than the previous four budgets in total.&quot; That figure includes $2.2 billion in compensation for victims of abuse in residential schools (another deal that was worked out with the previous government) and $300 million for off-reserve housing.

On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper thanked Jim Prentice for his work on addressing the matter of the Indian residential schools and providing a government apology for the residential school system. Stephen Harper&#x27;s thanks to Prentice came before he made the apology to former students of the schools.

==Minister of Industry==
In a cabinet shuffle on August 14, 2007, Prentice became Minister of Industry, succeeding Maxime Bernier.

===Copyright legislation and controversy===
Bringing &quot;Canada into WIPO treaty compliance&quot; had been stated as one of Prentice&#x27;s goals in future copyright legislation. It has been pointed out repeatedly, however, that at the time of Prentice&#x27;s statement of his rationale for introducing amendments to the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;, there was no international legal obligation to implement any provision of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (WCT) or the WIPO Performances &amp; Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) since neither had been ratified by Canada. Prentice has promised to &quot;put consumers first.&quot; claiming in an editorial that &quot;(C-61) allows the recording of webcasts and TV and radio programs to be enjoyed at different times&quot; while ignoring the fact that if the files are protected by digital rights management (DRM) it is illegal to break the DRM to make the recording. Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair of Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, has suggested that the core desire of the draft legislation is &quot;to satisfy U.S. pressure by enacting something very close to the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act&quot;.

Prentice did not immediately provide a rationale for not discussing the issue with CBC Radio Canada despite the hundreds of questions that flooded in from concerned Canadians. He also refused to talk to a group of protesters who went to his office to express their concern, stating &quot;When Canadian Heritage Minister Josée Verner and I have reached a consensus and we&#x27;re satisfied, we will introduce a bill.&quot; Prentice has also implied that he will not follow the Government&#x27;s policy to table the WCT &amp; WPPT 21 days prior to introducing copyright amendments designed to implement parts of these treaties contrary to the Government&#x27;s policy on treaty implementation. Industry Canada announced on June 11, 2008, that Prentice &quot;will deliver brief statements and answer media inquiries shortly after the tabling of a bill to amend the Copyright Act ... [on] Thursday, June 12, 2008&quot;. After less than two hours, hundreds of Canadians and critics panned the new Bill C-61 as nothing more than pandering to US interests at the expense of Canadians.

On a 10-minute interview with the CBC&#x27;s Search Engine radio program he dismissed any question related to digital rights management as &quot;extremely technical&quot; and claimed that the market will take care of copy protected CDs. Prentice then hung up mid question and refused to continue the interview at a later time. Most notably, Jim Prentice hung up before answering Jesse Brown&#x27;s final question about who, under this bill, would have the power to investigate potential copyright violations.

=== Wikipedia controversy ===

During the period of May 27, 2008, to June 4, 2008, edits originating from an IP address belonging to Industry Canada were made to the Jim Prentice article on Wikipedia. The edits included the removal of references to new copyright legislation (claiming that it did not exist) and the addition of two passages about Prentice&#x27;s recent accomplishments as Minister of Industry. Specifically, information about the copyright controversy was deleted from Prentice&#x27;s biography by someone using an Industry Canada IP address.

Jay Walsh, spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation, said in an interview there are tens of thousands of living people with biographies on Wikipedia, &quot;so challenges about information are not uncommon.&quot; Walsh said neutrality of language and guarding against conflicts of interest are two of the central pillars of Wikipedia. He said, &quot;The edits which should be trusted would come from people who don&#x27;t possess a conflict of interest, in this case, it would be worthwhile saying that if someone is making edits from a computer within the government of Canada … if it was someone within that ministry, that would theoretically constitute a conflict of interest.&quot;

===Auto industry===
In a February 29, 2008, speech to the Toronto Board of Trade Prentice rejected the concept of direct subsidies to the auto industry, insisting that setting up a strong economic foundation is a better route to strengthen the business. Former Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion said Finance Minister Jim Flaherty should be fired after the planned shutdown of the GM truck plant in Oshawa, Ont., with Prentice and Flaherty expressing hope for a new GM plant.

===Net neutrality===
While serving as a Federal Cabinet minister, Prentice received criticism that he was sidestepping the issue of Canada&#x27;s net neutrality laws by not providing clear answers regarding the government&#x27;s position on internet throttling practices by national Internet Service Providers (ISPs). New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus raised the issue to Prentice in the House of Commons and said the government&#x27;s &quot;hands off&quot; approach was bad for Canadian innovation. Prentice said that the issue is being appropriately handled by the Federal government agency the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which invited the general public to an open debate on net neutrality.

===Text messaging fees===
After initially appearing to take a stand on the issue, Prentice refused to intervene when Telus and Bell started charging 15 cents for incoming SMS text messages despite widespread opposition by consumer groups. This decision was made after Prentice dialogued with senior Bell and Telus executives and suggested that consumers &quot;seek alternatives&quot;, even in Canada&#x27;s limited-competition cellular industry.

==Minister of the Environment==

On October 30, 2008, Prentice was sworn in as Minister of the Environment in the Conservative Government. During his tenure, funding for the CFCAS (Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences) was not renewed, which some argued lead to a brain drain in the climate scientific community.

===Draft Prentice Movement===
Shortly after the Conservative government faced a possible defeat by the opposition over the Conservatives economic update, a &quot;Conservatives for Prentice&quot; website emerged, gaining a place on the Blogging Tories blogroll. A posting from a person claiming to be David Higginbottom, Prentice&#x27;s campaign manager in the last election, said, &quot;It is unfortunate that at a time when Conservatives need to be working together to prevent what is a desperate power play by the opposition to seize control of our democratically elected government, that a site like this would be created.&quot;

===Resignation===
On November 4, 2010, Prentice announced he was resigning as Environment Minister effective immediately and that he would be resigning as Member of Parliament for Calgary Centre-North by the end of the year to take a job as vice-chairman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

Prentice suggested that his departure was for family reasons; he had committed to spending 10 years in politics, and at that point he had. He expressed a desire to step down so he could explore new opportunities in his life. His resignation raised some questions with the opposition; NDP leader Jack Layton expressed concern over the apparent connection between Ministers and the large banks.

==Premier of Alberta==
Though previously rumoured to have been interested in succeeding Stephen Harper as federal Conservative leader, Prentice entered the 2014 Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership election on May 15, 2014. At the time the Alberta PC party was lagging badly in polls behind the opposition Wildrose due to personal expense controversies with Allison Redford, who resigned as premier and party leader after facing a revolt from the caucus and riding associations, with Dave Hancock serving in these roles for the interim. On September 6, 2014, Prentice won the leadership race with more than 76% of the vote on the first ballot (the leadership contest was conducted using Instant-runoff voting).

Prentice was formally sworn in as premier on September 15, 2014. He immediately named a 20-member Executive Council of Alberta, smaller than the cabinet had been under recent premiers. His recommendations for cabinet appointments included two people, former Edmonton mayor Stephen Mandel and former Calgary Board of Education trustee Gordon Dirks, who were not members of the Legislative Assembly. Prentice was elected to the legislature in a by-election in Calgary-Foothills, the seat formerly held by MLA Len Webber. The PCs won all four of the provincial by-elections held on October 27, 2014, in what was seen at the time as a major electoral success for Prentice.

On November 24, 2014, Wildrose Party MLAs Kerry Towle, (Innisfail-Sylvan Lake), and Ian Donovan, (Little Bow) crossed the floor to join the ruling PC Party&#x27;s caucus giving the turmoil within the Wildrose Party, uncertainty about the leadership of Danielle Smith and confidence in Prentice as reasons for their move.

On December 17, 2014, in a highly unusual move within any parliament using the Westminster system, Leader of the Opposition Danielle Smith confirmed that she and eight other Wildrose members – Rob Anderson, Gary Bikman, Rod Fox, Jason Hale, Bruce McAllister, Blake Pedersen, Bruce Rowe and Jeff Wilson – would cross the floor to the Progressive Conservative caucus. At a press conference, Smith said that her conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared so much common ground that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. &quot;If you’re going to be the official Opposition leader,&quot; she said, &quot;you have to really want to take down the government and really take down the premier. I don&#x27;t want to take down this premier. I want this premier to succeed.&quot; The defections were termed by a journalist as &quot;an unprecedented move in Canadian political history&quot;, although they did not change the overall make-up of the legislature – the Conservatives still held a vast majority of the seats, and the Wildrose Party remained the Official Opposition.
Prentice&#x27;s March 2015 budget &quot;raised a plethora of taxes and fees to help pay the province&#x27;s way out of its hole, but he refuses to touch corporate taxes, because he is spooked by the prospect of investors skipping over Alberta for their next billion-dollar energy project, in favour of some more clement petro-state somewhere else. This array of taxes on you and your friends, but not on the C-Suite in Calgary’s office-tower jungle, has provoked populists on the left and right&quot;. In retrospect, Ron Kneebone of the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy defended Prentice&#x27;s budget saying &quot;&#x27;We&#x27;ve got to look in the mirror.&#x27; He got tossed for it. But he was absolutely right because he said, &#x27;You guys keep electing us for spending all this money.&#x27;&quot;

On April 7, 2015, Prentice advised the Lieutenant Governor to call an early election for May 5 claiming that he needed to seek a new mandate in order to pass his budget, a full year before he was mandated to by the provincial fixed-election law of an election every four years (by the constitution, the incumbent government could run for up to five years before the writ had to be dropped in 2017). The Progressive Conservatives were already lagging in polls behind the resurgent Wildrose Party led by Brian Jean, as Prentice&#x27;s pre-election budget was deeply unpopular with both the left and right in the political spectrum while only &quot;business leaders thought it was tough but fair&quot;. Several gaffes by Prentice hurt him and his party in the campaign, including a comment before the election call in which Prentice appeared to be blaming Albertans, telling them that they had to &quot;look in the mirror&quot; to understand the root cause of Alberta&#x27;s &quot;serious budget shortfall&quot;; Alberta Party leader Greg Clark dubbed this “Mr. Prentice’s Alice in Wonderland moment because it’s only in some alternate reality that the blame for decades of PC mismanagement can be placed squarely on Albertans&quot;. There was an &quot;embarrassing miscalculation in the proposed NDP budget&quot; released two days before the debate that Prentice planned to capitalize upon; during the televised leaders&#x27; debate Prentice said &quot;I know math is difficult&quot; to Alberta New Democratic Party leader Rachel Notley in criticizing the &quot;multibillion-dollar hole in [her] proposed budget&quot;, however Prentice&#x27;s remark came under fire for as being deeply patronizing as well as potentially sexist. While Prentice otherwise performed respectably ahead of Wildrose leader Brian Jean and interim Liberal leader David Swann, the NDP gained momentum as a result of the debate and overtook Wildrose for the lead in polls.

The provincial election ended the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; 44-year run in government, with the Alberta New Democratic Party winning a majority government, the first time the party had been elected to government in the province&#x27;s history. The Progressive Conservatives fell to third place in the legislature, with 10 seats, behind both the NDP and the Wildrose Party. While the PCs placed second in terms of the popular vote, their caucus was decimated due to being completely shut out in Edmonton and losing all but eight seats in Calgary. Thirteen members of Prentice&#x27;s cabinet were defeated, though Prentice himself was re-elected in Calgary-Foothills. However, with the overall result beyond doubt, he resigned as PC leader, disclaimed his seat (thus voiding the election result in his riding) and retired from politics.

During the transition of power, Prentice advised Premier-designate Notley to continue settlement talks with the Lubicon Lake Band. The band had been seeking an agreement for 80 years, and Prentice had reopened negotiations in the fall of 2014. Notley recalled &quot;He saw a path forward and he advised me how to travel that path, for which I, and many, many others, are very grateful&quot;, and the land claim deal was reached in late 2018.

==After politics==
Prentice served as a visiting global fellow at the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C., for a four-month term that begun in February 2016. At the Wilson Center, he wrote the book &quot;Triple Crown: Winning Canada’s Energy Future&quot; with Jean-Sebastien Rioux that was published posthumously by HarperCollins on February 21, 2017.

Prentice was appointed as a senior advisor to private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC in June 2016, specializing in the energy industry.

==Death==

Prentice was among the four people killed in the October 13, 2016, crash of a twin-engine Cessna Citation 500 business jet in Lake Country, British Columbia, shortly after takeoff from Kelowna International Airport en route to Springbank Airport near Calgary. He had spent the day golfing in the Kelowna area and was returning home. In April 2018, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada reported that while no conclusive reason for the crash could be determined, it was likely that the pilot had experienced spatial disorientation shortly after takeoff, having had little experience flying at night.

A state funeral was held for Prentice on October 28, 2016. Numerous dignitaries were in attendance, including former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, interim federal Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, British Columbia Premier Christy Clark, Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, former prime minister Joe Clark and former opposition leader Preston Manning.

Prentice&#x27;s official portrait as Premier of Alberta was unveiled on February 4, 2019. Painted by David Goatley, it depicts Prentice &quot;standing on the third floor of the Alberta legislature, hands resting on the marble railing, eyes looking off in the distance. The expression and gaze shows Jim&#x27;s sense of vision. He&#x27;s thinking of the future and not the past.&quot; At the ceremony of the portrait unveiling, his widow Karen recalled that Prentice was &quot;one who couldn&#x27;t resist meeting with school tours when they passed by his office. He would invite them in, show them around, and give each of them the opportunity to sit in the premier&#x27;s chair. I honestly believe his hope was that the experience would inspire more than one of these children to become involved in politics one day, and perhaps even become premier&quot;.

<text>The zitting cisticola or streaked fantail warbler (Cisticola juncidis) is a widely distributed Old World warbler whose breeding range includes southern Europe, Africa (outside the deserts and rainforest), and southern Asia down to northern Australia. A small bird found mainly in grasslands, it is best identified by its rufous rump; in addition it lacks any gold on the collar and the brownish tail is tipped with white. During the breeding season males have a zigzagging flight display accompanied by regular &quot;zitting&quot; calls that have been likened to repeated snips of a scissor. They build their pouch nest suspended within a clump of grass.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

The zitting cisticola was described by the naturalist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1810 and given the binomial name &quot;Sylvia juncidis&quot;. The type locality is Campofelice di Roccella in Sicily. The current genus name &quot;Cisticola&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;kisthos&quot;, &quot;rock-rose&quot;, and Latin &quot;colere&quot;, &quot;to dwell&quot;. The specific &quot;juncidis&quot; is also from Latin and is a diminutive of &quot;iuncus&quot;, &quot;reed&quot;.

Across their wide distribution range, several variations in populations have been noted and as many as 18 subspecies are recognized. They differ slightly in calls, plumage and size and some have been considered full species in some taxonomic treatments. The nominate form is found in southern France, Greece, Turkey, Sicily, Corsica and Egypt while western Portugal and Spain have &quot;cisticola&quot;. The population in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Iran is &quot;neuroticus&quot; while the northern and eastern African population is &quot;uropygialis&quot; and &quot;perennius&quot; (further south). Gabon, Angola, and southern Africa are home to &quot;terrestris&quot;. The population in the Western Ghats of India, &quot;salimalii&quot;, does not show seasonal tail length variation as in &quot;cursitans&quot; of the plains of India and dry-zone of Sri Lanka, which has a longer tail in the non-breeding season. Population &quot;malaya&quot; is found in southern Southeast Asia, &quot;tinnabulans&quot; further north in southern China while &quot;brunniceps&quot; is found in Korea and Japan. Other populations include &quot;nigrostriatus&quot; (Philippines), &quot;constans&quot; (Sulawesi), &quot;fuscicapilla&quot; (east Java), &quot;leanyeri&quot; (northern Australia), &quot;normani&quot; (northwest Queensland) and &quot;laveryi&quot; (northeast Australia).

This genus is sometimes split off with various other southern warbler genera and given family status as the Cisticolidae. This species was previously known as the fan-tailed warbler, but the current name gives consistency with the many tropical cisticola species, as well as avoiding confusion with an American species also named the fan-tailed warbler.

== Description ==
The zitting cisticola is in length. It is brown above, heavily streaked with black markings. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, white-tipped and flicked frequently, giving rise to the alternative name for the species. The adult males have less crown streaking and more back marking than the females, but there are no great differences between the sexes or the eighteen geographical races. The absence of a nuchal collar separates it from the golden-headed cisticola (&quot;Cisticola exilis&quot;). In the non-breeding season, they tend to skulk within the grass and can be hard to spot.

== Habitat and distribution ==

This species is found mainly in grassland habitats, often near water. Most populations are resident, but some East Asian populations migrate south to warmer areas in winter. In the Himalayas, they ascend to about during summer but are below in the winter. This species is a rare vagrant to northern Europe, mostly as a spring overshoot. Its European range is generally expanding, although northern populations are especially susceptible to hard winters.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Zitting cisticolas are very small insectivorous birds, sometimes found in small groups. The breeding season is associated with the rains. Two broods a year occur in many regions. Males are generally polygynous, but some are monogamous. The male builds the initial nest structure deep in the grasses, and invites females using a special display. Females that accept the male complete the nest. The nest is made by binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The zitting cisticola&#x27;s nest is a cup shape with a canopy of tied-together leaves or grasses overhead for camouflage; 3–6 eggs are laid. The female incubates the eggs, which hatch after about 10 days. More than one brood may be raised. Females change their mates frequently and rarely stay within the same territory, while males are less mobile, maintaining non-overlapping song-territories which shift from day to day. Females can sometimes breed in their first year.

<text>Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes is a 1991 American two-part play by American playwright Tony Kushner. The two parts of the play, Millennium Approaches and Perestroika, may be presented separately. The work won numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Tony Award for Best Play, and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play. Part one of the play premiered in 1991, followed by part two in 1992. Its Broadway opening was in 1993.

The play is a complex, often metaphorical, and at times symbolic examination of AIDS and homosexuality in the United States in the 1980s. Certain major and minor characters are supernatural beings (angels) or deceased persons (ghosts). The play contains multiple roles for several actors. Initially and primarily focusing on one gay and one straight couple in Manhattan, the plot has several additional storylines, some of which intersect occasionally.

In 1994, playwright and professor of theater studies John M. Clum called the play &quot;a turning point in the history of gay drama, the history of American drama, and of American literary culture&quot;.

In 2003, HBO adapted &quot;Angels in America&quot; into a six-episode miniseries of the same title. In the Sunday, June 25, 2006, edition of &quot;The Record&quot;, in an article headlined “An AIDS anniversary: 25 years in the arts”, Bill Ervolino listed the miniseries among the 12 best filmed portrayals of AIDS to date.

In 2017, the play received a much-acclaimed West End revival that won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Revival in 2018. Later that year the production transferred to Broadway, where it received eleven Tony Award nominations, the most ever received by a play at the time. It won three awards: Best Revival of a Play; Best Actor in a Play, for Andrew Garfield; and Best Actor in a Featured Role in a Play, for Nathan Lane.

==Plot==
===Part One: Millennium Approaches===
Set in New York City, the play takes place between October 1985 and February 1986. The play begins at a funeral, where an elderly rabbi eulogizes the deceased woman&#x27;s entire generation of immigrants who risked their lives to build a community in the United States. Soon after, the deceased&#x27;s grandson, Louis Ironson, learns that his lover Prior Walter, the last member of an old stock American family, has AIDS. As Prior&#x27;s illness progresses, Louis becomes unable to cope, and he abandons Prior during a health episode that lands him in the hospital. Prior is given emotional support by their friend Belize, a hospital nurse and ex-drag queen, who separately also deals with Louis&#x27;s self-castigating guilt and myriad excuses for leaving Prior.

Joe Pitt, a Mormon Republican clerk in the same judge&#x27;s office where Louis holds a word-processing job, is offered a position in Washington, D.C. by his mentor, the McCarthyist lawyer and power broker Roy Cohn. Joe hesitates to accept due to his agoraphobic, Valium-addicted wife Harper, who refuses to relocate. Feeling adrift and undesired by Joe, Harper retreats into drug-fueled escapist fantasies, including a dream where she crosses paths with Prior even though the two of them have never met in the real world. She confronts Joe about his deeply-closeted homosexuality, which he views as a sin. Torn by pressure from Roy and a burgeoning infatuation with Louis, Joe drunkenly comes out to his conservative mother Hannah, who reacts by changing the subject and hanging up the phone. Concerned for her son, she sells her house in Salt Lake City and travels to New York. After Joe confesses his homosexuality to a drug-addled Harper and leaves her, she flees their apartment and wanders the streets of Brooklyn, believing she is in Antarctica. Joe sets out to look for her, but follows Louis to Central Park, where they tentatively begin an affair.

Meanwhile, Roy Cohn discovers that he has advanced AIDS and is dying. Defiantly refusing to publicly admit he is gay or has AIDS, Roy instead declares he has liver cancer. Facing disbarment for misappropriating money from a client, Roy is determined to beat the case so he can die a lawyer in good standing, and he attempts to position Joe in the Department of Justice to ensure the case is quashed. When Harper disappears and Joe refuses his offer, Roy flies into a rage and collapses in pain. As he awaits transport to the hospital, he is haunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg, whom he prosecuted in her trial for espionage, and who was executed after Roy illegally lobbied the judge for the death penalty.

Prior begins to experience intense dreams and visions as his health worsens. He hears the voice of an angel telling him to prepare for her arrival, a flaming book erupts from the floor during a medical check-up, and he receives visits from the ghosts of two ancestral Prior Walters, informing him that he is a divine prophet. Prior does not know if these visitations are hallucinations caused by an emotional breakdown or if they are real. At the end of Part One, a glorious winged Angel crashes through Prior&#x27;s bedroom ceiling, addresses him as &quot;Prophet&quot;, and proclaims that &quot;the Great Work&quot; has begun.

===Part Two: Perestroika===
The play begins with a speech given by the world&#x27;s oldest living Bolshevik, Aleksii Antedilluvianovich Prelapsarianov, addressing a crowd in Moscow in December 1985. He condemns the reforms proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev, decrying the notion of progress without political theory, and declaring that the only way forward is to not move.

At the funeral of a friend, a shaken Prior relates his encounter with the Angel to Belize. After revealing the presence of a mystical book underneath the tile in Prior&#x27;s kitchen, the Angel reveals to him that Heaven is a beautiful city that resembles San Francisco, and God, described as a great flaming Aleph, created the universe through copulation with His angels, who are all-knowing but unable to create or change on their own. God, bored with the angels, made mankind with the power to change and create. The progress of mankind on Earth caused Heaven to suffer earthquake-like tremors and physically deteriorate. Finally, on the day of the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, God abandoned Heaven. The Angel brings Prior a message for mankind—&quot;stop moving!&quot;—in the belief that if man ceases to progress, Heaven will be restored. Since the night of his vision, his health has once again started to decline. Belize believes that Prior is projecting his own fears of abandonment and death into an elaborate hallucination, but Prior suspects that his illness is the prophecy taking physical form, and that the only way the Angel can force him to deliver her message is for him to die.

Roy lands at the hospital in the care of Belize, where his condition rapidly declines. He manages to use his political clout to acquire a private stash of the experimental drug AZT, at the expense of withholding the drug from participants in a drug trial. Alone in the hospital and fighting disbarment, Roy finds himself increasingly isolated, with only Belize, who despises him, and the ghost of Ethel for company.

Prior goes to a Mormon visitors center to research angels, where he meets Hannah, who is volunteering there and taking care of Harper, who has slowly returned to reality but is now deeply depressed. Harper and Prior share a spark of recognition from their earlier shared dream, and witness a vision of Joe and Louis together. Louis is aghast to learn that Joe is a practicing Mormon and, regretting his actions and resistant to the intensity of Joe&#x27;s infatuation, begins to withdraw from Joe. He begs Prior&#x27;s forgiveness, which Prior angrily refuses, and Prior, who knows about Louis&#x27; affair with Joe from his vision, becomes deeply hurt that Louis is attempting to move on.

Joe visits Roy, who is near death, and receives a final, paternal blessing from his mentor. However, when Joe confesses he has left Harper for a man, Roy rejects him in a violent reaction of fear and rage, ordering him to return to his wife and cover up his indiscretion. Joe returns to Harper and they have an unsatisfying sexual encounter, which prompts Harper to realize their marriage is over. 
Prior, accompanied by Belize, jealously confronts a confused Joe at work, but the encounter descends into chaos when Belize recognizes Joe as Roy&#x27;s protegé. Belize informs Louis about Joe&#x27;s connection with Roy, whom Louis despises. Louis, as a result, researches Joe&#x27;s legal history and confronts him over a series of hypocritical and homophobic decisions Joe himself wrote. The confrontation turns violent, and Joe punches Louis in the face, ending their affair.

Ethel Rosenberg watches Roy suffer and decline before delivering the final blow as he lies dying: He has been disbarred after all. Delirious, Roy seems to mistake Ethel for his mother, begging her to comfort him, and Ethel sings a Yiddish lullaby as Roy appears to pass away. However, with a sudden burst of energy, he reveals that he has tricked her, viciously declaring that he has finally beaten her. He then suffers a stroke and dies. After Roy&#x27;s death, Belize forces Louis to visit Roy&#x27;s hospital room, where they steal his stash of AZT for Prior. Belize asks Louis to recite the Kaddish for Roy. Unseen by the living, Ethel guides Louis through the prayer, symbolically forgiving Roy before she departs for the hereafter.

After his confrontation with Joe, Prior begins following him obsessively, neglecting his health. He collapses from pneumonia after following Joe to the Mormon center and Hannah rushes him back to the hospital. Prior tells her about his vision and is surprised when Hannah accepts this, based on her belief in angelic revelations within Latter-day Saint theology. At the hospital, the Angel reappears, enraged that Prior has rejected her message. Prior, on Hannah&#x27;s advice, wrestles the Angel, who relents and opens a ladder into Heaven. Prior climbs into Heaven and tells the council of Angels that he refuses to deliver their message, as without progress, humanity will perish, and begs them for more Life, no matter how horrible the prospect might be. He returns to his hospital bed, where he awakens from his vision with his fever broken and his health beginning to recover. He makes amends with Louis, but refuses to take him back. Meanwhile, Harper departs New York for San Francisco, leaving Joe alone.

The play concludes in 1990, five years later. Prior and Louis are still separated, but Louis, along with Belize, remain close in order to support and care for Prior, and Hannah has found new perspective on her rigid beliefs, forging a friendship with the three gay men. Prior, Louis, Belize, and Hannah gather before the angel statue in Bethesda Fountain, discussing the fall of the Soviet Union and what the future holds. Prior talks of the legend of the Pool of Bethesda, where the sick were healed. Prior delivers the play&#x27;s final lines directly to the audience, blessing them and affirming his intentions to live on and telling them that &quot;the Great Work&quot; shall continue.

==Production history==
&quot;Angels in America&quot; was commissioned by the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, by co-artistic directors Oskar Eustis and Tony Taccone. It was first performed in Los Angeles as a workshop in May 1990 by the Center Theatre Group at the Mark Taper Forum.

&quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; premiered in May 1991 in a production performed by the Eureka Theatre Company of San Francisco, directed by David Esbjornson. In London it premiered in a National Theatre production at the Cottesloe Theatre, directed by Declan Donnellan. Henry Goodman played Cohn, Nick Reding played Joe, Felicity Montagu played Harper, Marcus D&#x27;Amico played Louis, and Sean Chapman played Prior. Opening on January 23, 1992, the London production ran for a year. In November 1992 it visited Düsseldorf as part of the first Union des Théâtres de l&#x27;Europe festival.

The play&#x27;s second part, &quot;Perestroika&quot;, was still being developed as &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; was being performed. It was performed several times as staged readings by both the Eureka Theatre (during the world premiere of part one in 1991), and the Mark Taper Forum (in May 1992). It premiered in November 1992 in a production by the Mark Taper Forum, directed by Oskar Eustis and Tony Taccone. In November 1993 it received its London debut at the National Theatre on the Cottesloe stage, in repertory with a revival of &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot;, again directed by Declan Donnellan. David Schofield played Cohn, Daniel Craig played Joe, Clare Holman played Harper, Jason Isaacs played Louis, Joseph Mydell played Belize and won the Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Stephen Dillane played Prior.

The entire two-part play debuted on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre in 1993, directed by George C. Wolfe, with &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; performed on May 4 and &quot;Perestroika&quot; joining it in repertory on November 23, closing December 4, 1994. The original cast included Ron Leibman, Stephen Spinella, Kathleen Chalfant, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Wright, Ellen McLaughlin, David Marshall Grant and Joe Mantello. Among the replacements during the run were F. Murray Abraham (for Ron Leibman), Cherry Jones (for Ellen McLaughlin), Dan Futterman (for Joe Mantello), Cynthia Nixon (for Marcia Gay Harden) and Jay Goede (for David Marshall Grant). &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot; were awarded, in 1993 and 1994 respectively, both the Tony Awards for Best Play and Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Play.

The published script indicates that Kushner made a few revisions to &quot;Perestroika&quot; in the following year. These changes officially completed the work in 1995. In 1994, the first national tour launched at the Royal George Theater in Chicago, directed by Michael Mayer, with the following cast: Peter Birkenhead as Louis Ironson, Reginald Flowers as Belize, Kate Goehring as Harper Pitt, Jonathan Hadary as Roy Cohn, Philip E. Johnson as Joe Pitt, Barbara E. Robertson as Hannah Pitt, Robert Sella as Prior, and Carolyn Swift as the Angel.

The Australian premiere of &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; was produced by Melbourne Theatre Company at Russell Street Theatre on 15 October 1993, running till 20 November 1993. The Australian premier of the entire two-part play was also produced by Melbourne Theatre Company, presented at the Playhouse, Melbourne, on 30 August 1994, running through till 25 September 1994. .

A Toronto production of both plays, directed by Bob Baker, opened at CanStage&#x27;s Berkley Theatre in November 1996 and ran for 8 months. The cast included Steve Cumyn (Prior), Alex Poch-Goldin (Louis), Tom Wood (Roy Cohn), Patricia Hamilton (Hannah, Ethel Rosenberg and others), David Storch (Joe), Karen Hines (Harper), Cassel Miles (Belize, Mr. Lies and others) and Linda Prystawska (Angel and othes).

Kushner made relatively minor revisions to &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and additional, more substantial revisions to &quot;Perestroika&quot; during a run at the Signature Theatre in 2010, which were published in a 2013 complete edition. That production was directed by Michael Greif and featured Christian Borle as Prior, Zachary Quinto as Louis, Billy Porter as Belize, Bill Heck as Joe, Zoe Kazan as Harper, Robin Bartlett as Hannah, Frank Wood as Roy, and Robin Weigert as the angel.

In 2013, a production of the two-part play was produced by Sydney-based theatre company, Belvoir. The cast featured Luke Mullins as Prior Walter, Mitchell Butel as Louis Ironson, Marcus Graham as Roy Cohn, Ashley Zukerman as Joe Pitt, Amber McMahon as Harper Pitt, Robyn Nevin as Hannah Pitt, DeObia Oparei as Belize, and Paula Arundell as The Angel. The show ran from June 1 to July 14 at the Belvoir St Theatre, before transferring to the Theatre Royal for the remainder of its run. The production finished its season on July 27.

A second Toronto production by Soulpepper Theatre Company in 2013 and 2014 starred Damien Atkins as Prior Walter, Gregory Prest as Louis, Mike Ross as Joe, Diego Matamoros as Roy and Nancy Palk as Hannah, Ethel Rosenberg and the rabbi.

&quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; made its Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut, in a production by St Andrews-based Mermaids Theatre, in August 2013 to critical acclaim.

Asia premiered the play in its entirety in 1995 by the New Voice Company in the Philippines.

This was followed by another production in November 2014 at the Singapore Airlines Theatre.

An Italian adaptation of the play premiered in Modena in 2007, in a production directed by Ferdinando Bruni and Elio De Capitani which was awarded several national awards. The same production ran for three days in Madrid in 2012.

In the fall of 2016, the Round House Theatre and Olney Theatre Center in Montgomery County, Maryland, collaborated to present a 25th anniversary production of the play, offering Parts I and II in repertory. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s theater critic called it an &quot;epically engrossing, acidly funny masterwork.&quot;

In April 2017, a new production began previews at the National Theatre, London in the Lyttleton Theatre. Directed by Marianne Elliott, the cast included Andrew Garfield as Prior Walter with Russell Tovey as Joe, Denise Gough as Harper, James McArdle as Louis Ironson, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as Belize and Nathan Lane as Roy Cohn. In April 2018, the production was nominated for six Olivier Awards, winning for Best Revival and Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Play for Gough. The production was filmed and broadcast to cinemas around the world as part of the National Theatre Live initiative, and later released in 2021 on the company&#x27;s &quot;NT at Home&quot; streaming service.

In August 2017, a new production of &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; was brought to San Juan, Puerto Rico, by Teatro Público Inc. Directed by Benjamín Cardona, the cast featured Carlos Miranda as Roy Cohn, Jacqueline Duprey as Hannah, Gabriela Saker as Harper, and Liván Albelo as Prior. The production received critical praise and launched the new theater company.

In September 2017, a revival of the two plays were staged in Melbourne at fortyfivedownstairs for nearly a four-week run. The cast included veteran actor Helen Morse as Hannah Pitt, and Margaret Mills (who had appeared in the original Australian premiere of the play in 1994) as The Angel.

In February 2018, the 2017 Royal National Theatre production transferred to Broadway for an 18-week engagement at the Neil Simon Theatre. The majority of the London cast returned, with Lee Pace replacing Tovey as Joe, and Beth Malone playing the Angel at certain performances. Previews began on February 23, 2018, with opening night on March 25. The production won for Best Revival of a Play at that year&#x27;s Tony Awards, with Garfield and Lane winning for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play respectively for their reprisal of their National Theatre performances, while Denise Gough and Susan Brown were nominated for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. The production was recorded as an audiobook by Random House Audio, with Malone as the Angel and Bobby Canavale and Edie Falco narrating.

A critically acclaimed production opened at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in April 2018, directed by original commissioner Tony Taccone and featuring Randy Harrison as Prior, Stephen Spinella (who originated Prior Walter on Broadway) as Roy Cohn, Carmen Roman as Hannah, Benjamin T. Ismail as Louis, Danny Binstock as Joe, Bethany Jillard as Harper, Francisca Faridany and Lisa Ramirez alternating as the Angel, and Caldwell Tidicue, better known as Bob the Drag Queen, making his stage debut as Belize.

In the spring of 2023, Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Arena Stage presented Part 1, &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot;, starkly staged by Hungarian director Janos Szasz. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s critic noted &quot;&quot;Angels in America&quot; is back in freshly provocative, exhilarating form,&quot; particularly &quot;the collision of seven disparate figures...who interconnect over matters political, medical, romantic — and most malignantly, through the machinations of one of them, lawyer Roy Cohn, played by Edward Gero to the toxic T.&quot;
The South Australian revival of &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; &amp; &quot;Perestroika&quot; directed by Hayley Horton as performed at the Adelaide Little Theatre by the Adelaide Theatre Guild from 2 May 2024 - 25 May 2024. The production starred Kate Anolak as Hannah, Lee Cook as Louis, Rachel Dalton as The Angel, Brant Eustice as Roy, Matt Houston as Prior, Casmira Lorien as Harper, Eric McDowell and Belize and Lindsay Prodea as Joe with original music by Phil Short.

In October 2024, a production of the play opened at Finnish National Theatre where it had also run three decades earlier in 1994. The new production was adapted to a single four-hour play by Linda Wallgren who also directed it.

In April 2025, International Theatre Amsterdam is set to perform a new production of the play, remaking the 2008 version directed by ITA director Ivo van Hove.

==Staging==
Kushner prefers that the theatricality be transparent. In his notes about staging, he writes: &quot;The plays benefit from a pared-down style of presentation, with scenery kept to an evocative and informative minimum. [...] I recommend rapid scene shifts (no blackouts!), employing the cast as well as stagehands in shifting the scene. This must be an actor-driven event. [...] The moments of magic [...] are to be fully imagined and realized, as wonderful &quot;theatrical&quot; illusions—which means it&#x27;s OK if the wires show, and maybe it&#x27;s good that they do...&quot; Kushner is an admirer of Bertolt Brecht, who practiced a style of theatrical production whereby audiences were often reminded that they were in a theatre. The choice to have &quot;no blackouts&quot; allows audiences to participate in the construction of a malleable theatrical world.

One of the many theatrical devices in &quot;Angels&quot; is that each of the eight main actors has one or several other minor roles in the play. For example, the actor playing the nurse, Emily, also plays the Angel, Sister Ella Chapter (a real estate agent), and a homeless woman. This doubling and tripling of roles encourages the audience to consider the elasticity of, for example, gender and sexual identities.

== Cast ==
==Adaptations==
===HBO miniseries===

In 2003, HBO Films created a miniseries adaptation of the play. Kushner adapted his original text for the screen, and Mike Nichols directed. HBO broadcast the film in various formats: three-hour segments that correspond to &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot;, as well as one-hour &quot;chapters&quot; that roughly correspond to an act or two of each of these plays. The first three chapters were initially broadcast on December 7, to international acclaim, with the final three chapters following. &quot;Angels in America&quot; was the most watched made-for-cable film in 2003 and won both the Golden Globe and Emmy for Best Miniseries.

Kushner made certain changes to his play (especially Part Two, &quot;Perestroika&quot;) for it to work on screen, but the HBO adaptation is generally a faithful representation of Kushner&#x27;s original work. Kushner has been quoted as saying that he knew Nichols was the right person to direct the film when, at their first meeting, Nichols immediately said that he wanted actors to play multiple roles, as had been done in stage productions.

The main cast consists of Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Jeffrey Wright (reprising his Tony-winning Broadway role), Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, Patrick Wilson, and Mary-Louise Parker.

===Opera===
&quot;Angels in America – The Opera&quot; made its world premiere at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, France, on November 23, 2004. The opera was based on both parts of the &quot;Angels in America&quot; fantasia, however the script was re-worked and condensed to fit both parts into a two and half hour show. Composer Peter Eötvös explains: &quot;In the opera version, I put less emphasis on the political line than Kushner...I rather focus on the passionate relationships, on the highly dramatic suspense of the wonderful text, on the permanently uncertain state of the visions.&quot; A German version of the opera followed suit in mid-2005. The opera made its US debut in June 2006 at the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion in Boston, Massachusetts.

===Music===
The text of Prior Walter&#x27;s monologue from Act 5, Scene 5 of &quot;Perestroika&quot; was set to music by Michael Shaieb for a 2009 festival celebrating Kushner&#x27;s work at the Guthrie Theater. The work was commissioned by the Twin Cities Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus, which had commissioned Shaieb&#x27;s &quot;Through A Glass, Darkly&quot; in 2008. The work premiered at the Guthrie in April 2009.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Angels in America&quot; received numerous awards, including the 1993 and 1994 Tony Awards for Best Play. The play&#x27;s first part, &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot;, received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

The play garnered much praise upon its release for its dialogue and exploration of social issues. &quot;Mr. Kushner has written the most thrilling American play in years,&quot; wrote &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

A decade after the play&#x27;s premiere, &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; labeled it &quot;one of the most important pieces of theater to come out of the late 20th century.&quot;

By contrast, in an essay titled &quot;Angles in America&quot;, the cultural critic Lee Siegel wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;&quot;Angels in America&quot; is a second-rate play written by a second-rate playwright who happens to be gay, and because he has written a play about being gay, and about AIDS, no one—and I mean no one—is going to call &quot;Angels in America&quot; the overwrought, coarse, posturing, formulaic mess that it is.&quot; In his 1995 book &quot;Homos&quot;, literary critic and queer theorist Leo Bersani called &quot;Angels in America&quot; a &quot;muddled and pretentious play&quot;, &quot;[whose] enormous success [...] is a sign, if we need still another one, of how ready and anxious America is to see and hear about gays—provided we reassure America how familiar, how morally sincere, and, particularly in the case of Kushner&#x27;s work, how innocuously full of significance we can be.&quot;

===Controversy===
In response to the frank treatment of homosexuality and AIDS, and brief male nudity, the play quickly became subject to controversial reaction from conservative and religious groups, sometimes labelled as being part of the &quot;culture war&quot;. In Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1996, there were protests held outside a production of the play by the Charlotte Repertory Theatre at the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. This led to funding cuts for the Arts &amp; Science Council of Charlotte, the city&#x27;s arts funding agency, in the following year.
A 1999 production at Kilgore College, a community college in Kilgore, Texas, sparked protests from area and national homophobic groups and led to the town&#x27;s mayor and commissioners pulling funds for the Texas Shakespeare Festival, which the production&#x27;s director also ran. Kushner wrote a letter of support to the cast and crew, and the production did go forward.

<text>Miltenberg () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the city of Aschaffenburg, the districts of Aschaffenburg and Main-Spessart, and the states of Baden-Württemberg (districts of Main-Tauber and Neckar-Odenwald) and Hesse (districts of Odenwaldkreis and Darmstadt-Dieburg).

==History==
During the Middle Ages there was continuous fighting between the Archbishop of Mainz and the Counts of Rieneck. Both attempted to rule the region and erected castles in the Spessart hills. Later other small fiefs became involved in these fights as well.

During the 13th century the towns along the river Main emerged. As a result of the trade on the river, their wealth grew, and this became a very prosperous region. Prosperity ended abruptly in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when the area was devastated and depopulated.

In 1803, the ecclesial states of Germany were dissolved, among them the Archbishopric of Mainz. By 1816, the Kingdom of Bavaria had annexed the entire region.

The district of Miltenberg was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Miltenberg and Obernburg.

==Geography==
The district is located in a hilly area on both banks of the river Main. On the western bank the Odenwald hills are rising, and on the eastern bank lies the Spessart range.

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €34,833. This places the district 52nd out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).

==Coat of arms==
The district&#x27;s coat of arms might be described thus: Gules a pallet wavy argent, dexter a wheel spoked of six of the same, sinister dancetty of three of the first and second, a chief bendy lozengy argent and azure. The coat of arms displays:
* the blue and silver tilted diamond pattern (&quot;bendy lozengy&quot;) of Bavaria&#x27;s flag in the chief (band at the top)
* a silver wheel, the Wheel of Mainz, symbolising the Archbishopric of Mainz
* a wavy pallet (narrow vertical stripe), symbolising the Main
* three silver points over a red field, the &quot;Franconian Rake&quot;, symbolising the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg

<doc id="394759" wikidata="Q5187156" url="?curid=394759" title="Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood">
<text>The Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (CRB) ( or HRB) was an Australian-based Croatian separatist terrorist organisation.

The organisation was established by four Croatian emigres: Jure Maric, Ilija Tolic, Josip Oblak, and Geza Pasti. The organisation carried out terrorist actions in Europe and Australia. The organisation was active throughout the territory of Yugoslavia in the early and mid-1960s. Its aim was to start an uprising in Yugoslavia and to establish an independent Croatia. This mission failed due to the intervention of the State Security Administration, the Yugoslav secret police.

==Actions==
* Action Kangaroo (July 1963) The objective was to focus on the Croatian villages and provincial enterprises in northern Yugoslavia, spreading anti-Communist propaganda and promoting civil unrest.
* Belgrade cinema bombing in 1968
* Belgrade train station bombing in 1968
* Uprising attempt in Bugojno, 1972
* Action Kaktus; a sabotage attempt on the 1975 tourist season

==Notable members==
Some notable CRB members were:
*Jure Maric
*Ilija Tolic
*Josip Oblak
*
*Blaž Kraljević
*
These people were also members of Ante Pavelić&#x27;s Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP) but they left that organisation because they decided they would not achieve their goals through the political route.

UDBA, the Yugoslav secret police, attempted to curb the group&#x27;s terrorist activities by engaging in covert assassinations of its members. Geza Pašti was killed in Nice in 1965, and Marijan Šimundić was killed in Stuttgart in 1967.

The CRB/HRB&#x27;s motto was: &quot;Život za Hrvatsku&quot; [&quot;Life for Croatia&quot;].

<doc id="394762" wikidata="Q2569896" url="?curid=394762" title="Book of Thoth">
<text>Book of Thoth is a name given to many ancient Egyptian texts supposed to have been written by Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. They include many texts that were claimed to exist by ancient authors and a magical book that appears in an Egyptian work of fiction.

==Texts that are known or claimed to exist==
The Egyptians stored many texts, on a wide range of subjects, in &quot;Houses of Life&quot;, the libraries contained within temple complexes. As Thoth was the god of knowledge, many of these texts were claimed to be his work.

The Book of Thoth is mentioned in the oldest inscription on the sarcophagus of the Imamy with a quote from chapter 68 of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, as well as on the sarcophagus of Sobek.: &quot;You (Imamy) are sitting under the branches of a fig tree near Hathor in front of a wide sun disk when she goes to Heleopolis, with the writing of the word of God in the book of Thoth.&quot;

The church father Clement of Alexandria, in the sixth book of his work &quot;Stromata&quot;, mentions forty-two books used by Egyptian priests that he says contain &quot;the whole philosophy of the Egyptians&quot;. All these books, according to Clement, were written by Hermes (a pre-existing Greek god that the Greeks likened to Thoth, claiming they were the same god, having similar qualities, e.g. both invented writing). Translation from Egyptian language and concepts to Greek language and concepts was not entirely accurate, and some Egyptian authenticity was lost. Among the subjects they cover are hymns, rituals, temple construction, astrology, geography, and medicine.

The Egyptologists Richard Lewis Jasnow and Karl-Theodor Zauzich have dubbed a long Egyptian text from the Ptolemaic period &quot;the Book of Thoth&quot;. This Demotic text, known from more than forty fragmentary copies, consists of a dialogue between a person called &quot;The-one-who-loves-knowledge&quot; and a figure that Jasnow and Zauzich identify as Thoth. The topics of their conversation include the work of scribes, various aspects of the gods and their sacred animals, and the Duat, the realm of the dead.

==Fictional book==
The fictional &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; appears in an ancient Egyptian short story from the Ptolemaic period, known as &quot;Setne Khamwas and Naneferkaptah&quot; or &quot;Setne I&quot;. The book, written by Thoth, contains two spells, one of which allows the reader to understand the speech of animals, and one which allows the reader to perceive the gods themselves.

According to the story, the book was originally hidden at the bottom of the Nile near Coptos, where it was locked inside a series of boxes guarded by serpents. The Egyptian prince Neferkaptah fought the serpents and retrieved the book, but in punishment for his theft from Thoth, the gods killed his wife Ahwere and son Merab. Neferkaptah committed suicide and was entombed along with the book. Generations later, the story&#x27;s protagonist, Setne Khamwas (a character based on the historical prince Khaemwaset), steals the book from Neferkaptah&#x27;s tomb despite opposition from Neferkaptah&#x27;s ghost. Setne then meets a beautiful woman who seduces him into killing his children and humiliating himself in front of the pharaoh. He discovers that this episode was an illusion created by Neferkaptah, and in fear of further retribution, Setne returns the book to Neferkaptah&#x27;s tomb. At Neferkaptah&#x27;s request, Setne also finds the bodies of Neferkaptah&#x27;s wife and son and buries them in Neferkaptah&#x27;s tomb, which is then sealed.

The story reflects the Egyptian belief that the gods&#x27; knowledge is not meant for humans to possess.

==In popular culture==

The &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; is often featured in fiction with Egyptian or supernatural themes. Novels that do so include &quot;Brood of the Witch-Queen&quot; (1918) 
by Sax Rohmer; &quot;Moses, Man of the Mountain&quot; (1938) by Zora Neale Hurston; &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot; (1972) by Ishmael Reed; &quot;The Rosetta Key&quot; (2008) by William Dietrich; and &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (2012) by Rick Riordan. The &quot;Book&quot; plays a role in Henry H. Neff&#x27;s juvenile fantasy series &quot;The Tapestry&quot;, Lisa Maxwell&#x27;s young adult series The Last Magician, and Lynne Ewing&#x27;s young adult series &quot;Sisters of Isis&quot;.

The &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; is mentioned in several stories by H. P. Lovecraft, most notably &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot;, where it is linked with Yog-Sothoth, an alien entity worshiped by sages and magicians.

The &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; also appears in video games. For example, it is a side-quest element in &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey&quot;. In both the multi-player online battle arena &quot;Smite&quot; and &quot;Board Game Online&quot;, the &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; is a usable item. In Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI, it is present as a holy relic that generates faith and tourism. In The Fool&#x27;s Errand, it represents the overarching meta-puzzle that must be unlocked and solved to complete the game.

In the third arc of the manga (and anime) &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, the antagonist Boingo&#x27;s supernatural ability is named Thoth and takes the form of a fortune-telling comic book. In the Japanese novel (and anime) &quot;Myriad Colors Phantom World&quot;, the protagonist has an ability called &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot;.

The &quot;Book of Toth&quot; and the tomb of &quot;Nefer-Ka-Ptah&quot; also are animated in the short film &quot;The riddle of the Sphinx&quot;, directed by the Ukraïnian director &quot;Vladimir Pekar&quot; (1985).

The &quot;Book of Toth&quot; is mentioned in Season 2 Episode 3 (Muninn) of American Gods

<text>Jack Joseph Osbourne (born 8 November 1985) is a British-American media personality. He is the son of heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, and Sharon Osbourne. He starred on MTV&#x27;s reality series &quot;The Osbournes&quot; (2002–2005), along with his father, mother Sharon, and sister Kelly. Osbourne has since pursued a career as a fitness and travel reporter, presenting shows such as &quot;Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie&quot; (2005–2009) and BBC&#x27;s &quot;Saving Planet Earth&quot; (2007). In 2016, he and his father Ozzy travelled the world in the History Channel reality series &quot;Ozzy &amp; Jack&#x27;s World Detour.&quot;

==Early life==
Osbourne was born on 8 November 1985 in London to heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath, and his wife and manager, Sharon (née Levy). Jack Osbourne has stated that his childhood was &quot;perfectly happy and contented&quot;. For the first six years of his life, Jack lived in the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire, then his parents moved the family to Los Angeles, but a year later the family returned to Buckinghamshire. When Osbourne was 11, the family moved back again to Southern California, this time to Beverly Hills. In spite of moving so many times at a young age, Osbourne did not find it disruptive.

One aspect of his life that constant moving did affect was his school life, and Osbourne soon despised going to school, which was not helped by the fact that he was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia at the age of 8, and ADHD at the age of 10. At the time, he was studying at a Christian school in Los Angeles. He returned to England for a year before returning to Los Angeles, where he was enrolled into the special needs Park Century School. At 14, he was offered an internship at Virgin Records, where his mother was managing the band The Smashing Pumpkins. After Sharon stopped managing that band, Osbourne started A&amp;R scouting for Epic Records, where his father had been on for many years. Osbourne also helped his mother in managing his father&#x27;s annual touring festival, Ozzfest, advising her about up-and-coming bands.

On his 13th birthday, Osbourne got drunk for the first time on whisky; by the time he was 14, he was drinking regularly and had started smoking marijuana. He started partying heavily, and made headlines on 21 April 2003, when he was admitted to a child psychiatric ward for an addiction to OxyContin. Osbourne&#x27;s drug addiction escalated after his mother was diagnosed with cancer; he was as well battling with his own depression. His self-destructive behaviour came to a head when he attempted suicide by taking a cocktail of prescription pills and cutting his hands with shards of glass after hearing his girlfriend&#x27;s ex-boyfriend pick up her phone when he called her. He woke up 12 hours later. Osbourne continued with his drug use until he realised that he &quot;never wants to feel this way ever again&quot; and admitted himself into an adolescent psychiatric ward. He spent 10 days detoxing and was moved to an adolescent rehabilitation center in Malibu, where he enrolled in a recovery program.

==Career==

Osbourne gained high visibility in 2002 after appearing in his family&#x27;s reality television show &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, which aired on MTV and won an Emmy Award in 2002. In the show, Osbourne was mostly shown as a rebellious teenager who liked to party and to fight with sister Kelly Osbourne. In a song by Tenacious D advertising &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, Jack Black sings the line &quot;and he&#x27;s got a big &#x27;fro on his head&quot; to describe Osbourne&#x27;s curly hair that grew longer until he eventually shaved it off in the third season of the show. In 2002, Osbourne briefly appeared in &quot;Austin Powers: Goldmember&quot; along with the rest of his family, and subsequently starred in a Super Bowl XXXVI advertisement for Pepsi Twist with sister Kelly. From 2002 to 2003, Osbourne appeared in Season 6 of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, playing Audrey&#x27;s childhood friend. He also made cameos in &quot;The X Factor&quot; (as a &quot;Goth rapper&quot; who sings &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;), the fifth season of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; as a DMV customer and as a dining room guest in the eighth season of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. Post-rehab, Osbourne went on in 2003 to star in his own show on Channel 4, &quot;Union Jack&quot;. In 2004 he played a small role in &quot;New York Minute&quot;, a film starring the Olsen twins, in which he plays a music promoter named Justin.

In 2005, Osbourne started to show more of an interest in fitness through co-hosting the ITV2 show, &quot;Celebrity Wrestling: Bring It On!&quot;. In February that year, he appeared in &quot;Extreme Celebrity Detox&quot; in which he took part in tai chi and climbing exercises. He later appeared in his own programme, &quot;Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie&quot; produced by the same production company (Ginger Productions) as &quot;Extreme Celebrity Detox&quot;. Osbourne lost (50Lb) 23 kg in Thailand at a Muay Thai martial arts camp in Pattaya in order to be fit enough to climb El Capitan (which he achieved) whilst filming the first series of &quot;Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie&quot;. It aired on ITV2 in the UK, the Travel Channel in the United States, The LifeStyle Channel in Australia, GOtv in South Africa and on MuchMusic in Canada. &quot;Adrenaline Junkie&quot; focuses on Osbourne&#x27;s training for sports like rock climbing, mountaineering and a jungle trek in Belize from the Chiquibul Chamber through dense jungle ending at Caracol ruins (guided by the UK extreme conservation organisation Trekforce). He showcased the effects of his weight loss with the two semi-naked photo shoots for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine in 2005 to raise awareness of testicular cancer. The first, taken in June 2005, shows him sitting on a motorbike; the second appeared in the December 2005 issue. After the first series of &quot;Adrenaline Junkie&quot; he began filling in for Stephen Mulhern on CITV&#x27;s Saturday morning kids&#x27; show &quot;Holly &amp; Stephen&#x27;s Saturday Showdown&quot; (which has since ended). Osbourne took part in Sport Relief and faced former singer in the band S Club 7, Bradley McIntosh, in a boxing match of three one-minute rounds to raise money for the charity. Osbourne won by a unanimous decision.

He once claimed to be considering a career in law enforcement and was on reality television show &quot;Armed &amp; Famous&quot;. The show was pulled from CBS in January 2007, and Osbourne was sued by a woman from Muncie, Indiana, whose house was accidentally raided during filming. Osbourne also filmed a programme in Namibia for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Saving Planet Earth&quot; series. He also took part in the Mongol Rally with News Corporation director Andrew Knight&#x27;s daughter, Amaryllis Knight. Osbourne and his family reunited with reality TV show Osvournes Reloaded, whicht debuted 31 March 2009 and was cancelled after the first episode.

Osbourne made and produced a documentary about his father that was originally to be titled to &quot;Wreckage of My Past: The Ozzy Osbourne Story&quot;, but was changed to &quot;God Bless Ozzy Osbourne&quot;. This film premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on DVD in November 2011. In early August 2010, Osbourne directed his first music video, for his dad&#x27;s song &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; from the album &quot;Scream&quot;. The video debuted on 23 August. Osbourne worked for Fuse News from February 2013 to early 2014. Osbourne also had a paranormal investigation show titled &quot;Haunted Highway&quot; that aired on Syfy for two six-episode seasons, during the summers of 2012 and 2013.

Between 2016 and 2018, Osbourne appeared with his father Ozzy in the U.S. worldwide buddy travelogue series &quot;Ozzy &amp; Jack&#x27;s World Detour&quot; on the History Channel. He currently has three paranormal television shows featured on the Travel Channel, which are &quot;Jack Osbourne&#x27;s Night of Terror&quot;, &quot;Portals To Hell&quot; and &quot;The Osbournes Want To Believe&quot; with both of his parents Ozzy and Sharon.

==Personal life==
Osbourne and his girlfriend, actress Lisa Stelly, had their first child, a daughter, on 24 April 2012. Osbourne and Stelly were married in Hawaii on 7 October 2012. In August 2013, Osbourne and his wife announced they were expecting their second child, but on 6 September 2013, Osbourne&#x27;s wife Lisa revealed she suffered a miscarriage in her second trimester; they had been expecting a son. Their next child, a daughter, was born on 13 June 2015. Their third daughter was born on 4 February 2018. The couple announced their separation on 18 May 2018. Their divorce was finalised on 5 March 2019.

Osbourne became engaged to fashion designer Aree Gearhart in December 2021. They welcomed their first child together, a daughter, on 9 July 2022.

In June 2012, Osbourne announced that he had been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. He had experienced symptoms for a number of years including blindness in one eye; numbness in both legs; and problems with his bladder, bowel, and stomach. Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy. He has also made lifestyle changes such as minimizing stress, exercising regularly, and significantly altering his diet. However, he has spoken of his fear of a rapid decline and has admitted that his doctors have urged him to stop participating in highly intensive physical workouts: &quot;Right now am I going to be in a wheelchair? No. But if I don&#x27;t take care of myself, who knows?&quot; While appearing on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in October 2013, Osbourne said that he did not suffer from &quot;any severe symptoms other than the odd bit of tingling down my leg and the occasional bout of fatigue.&quot;

Osbourne and fiancée Aree Gearhart secretly married at the San Ysidro Ranch in California, September 2023.

<text>Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are genetically engineered chromosomes derived from the DNA of the yeast, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; , which is then ligated into a bacterial plasmid. By inserting large fragments of DNA, from 100–1000 kb, the inserted sequences can be cloned and physically mapped using a process called chromosome walking. This is the process that was initially used for the Human Genome Project, however due to stability issues, YACs were abandoned for the use of bacterial artificial chromosome 

The bakers&#x27; yeast &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is one of the most important experimental organisms for studying eukaryotic molecular genetics.

Beginning with the initial research of the Rankin et al., Strul et al., and Hsaio et al., the inherently fragile chromosome was stabilized by discovering the necessary autonomously replicating sequence (ARS); a refined YAC utilizing this data was described in 1983 by Murray et al.

The primary components of a YAC are the ARS, centromere , and telomeres from &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. Additionally, selectable marker genes, such as antibiotic resistance and a visible marker, are utilized to select transformed yeast cells. Without these sequences, the chromosome will not be stable during extracellular replication, and would not be distinguishable from colonies without the vector.

==Construction==
A YAC is built using an initial circular DNA plasmid, which is typically cut into a linear DNA molecule using restriction enzymes; DNA ligase is then used to ligate a DNA sequence or gene of interest into the linearized DNA, forming a single large, circular piece of DNA. The basic generation of linear yeast artificial chromosomes can be broken down into 6 main steps:

==Full chromosome III==

Chromosome III is the third smallest chromosome in S. cerevisiae; its size was estimated from pulsed-field gel electro- phoresis studies to be 300–360 kb

This chromosome has been the subject of intensive study, not least because it contains the three genetic loci involved in mating-type control: MAT, HML and HMR.
In March 2014, Jef Boeke of the Langone Medical Centre at New York University, published that his team has synthesized one of the &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; 16 yeast chromosomes, the chromosome III, that he named synIII. The procedure involved replacing the genes in the original chromosome with synthetic versions and the finished synthesized chromosome was then integrated into a yeast cell. It required designing and creating 273,871 base pairs of DNA - fewer than the 316,667 pairs in the original chromosome.

==Uses in biotechnology==
Yeast expression vectors, such as YACs, YIps (yeast integrating plasmids), and YEps (yeast episomal plasmids), have an advantage over bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) in that they can be used to express eukaryotic proteins that require posttranslational modification. By being able to insert large fragments of DNA, YACs can be utilized to clone and assemble the entire genomes of an organism. With the insertion of a YAC into yeast cells, they can be propagated as linear artificial chromosomes, cloning the inserted regions of DNA in the process. With this completed, two processes can be used to obtain a sequenced genome, or region of interest:

# Physical Mapping 
# Chromosome Walking

This is significant in that it allows for the detailed mapping of specific regions of the genome. Whole human chromosomes have been examined, such as the X chromosome, generating the location of genetic markers for numerous genetic disorders and traits.

==The Human Genome Project==

In the United States, the Human Genome Project first took clear form in February of 1988, with the release of the National Research Council (NRC) report Mapping and Sequencing the Human Genome. YACs are significantly less stable than BACs, producing &quot;chimeric effects&quot; : artifacts where the sequence of the cloned DNA actually corresponds not to a single genomic region but to multiple regions. Chimerism may be due to either co-ligation of multiple genomic segments into a single YAC, or recombination of two or more YACs transformed in the same host Yeast cell. The incidence of chimerism may be as high as 50%. Other artifacts are deletion of segments from a cloned region, and rearrangement of genomic segments (such as inversion). In all these cases, the sequence as determined from the YAC clone is different from the original, natural sequence, leading to inconsistent results and errors in interpretation if the clone&#x27;s information is relied upon. Due to these issues, the Human Genome Project ultimately abandoned the use of YACs and switched to bacterial artificial chromosomes, where the incidence of these artifacts is very low. In addition to stability issues, specifically the relatively frequent occurrence of chimeric events, YACs proved to be inefficient when generating the minimum tiling path covering the entire human genome. Generating the clone libraries is time consuming. Also, due to the nature of the reliance on sequence tagged sites (STS) as a reference point when selecting appropriate clones, there are large gaps that need further generation of libraries to span. It is this additional hindrance that drove the project to utilize BACs instead. This is due to two factors:

# BACs are much quicker to generate, and when generating redundant libraries of clones, this is essential
# BACs allow more dense coverage with STSs, resulting in more complete and efficient minimum tiling paths generated in silico.

However, it is possible to utilize both approaches, as was demonstrated when the genome of the nematode, &quot;C. elegans&quot;. There majority of the genome was tiled with BACs, and the gaps filled in with YACs.

<text>Barton Hartshorn is a civil parish about southwest of Buckingham in Buckinghamshire, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. Its southern boundary is a brook called the Birne, and this and the parish&#x27;s western boundary form part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. At the 2011 Census the population of the parish was included in the civil parish of Chetwode

The toponym &quot;Barton&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;Barley Farm&quot;, and is a common place name in England. In the 11th century it was recorded as &quot;Bertone&quot;. In the 15th century it was recorded as &quot;Barton Hertishorne&quot; and &quot;Beggars Barton&quot;, and in the 16th century it was &quot;Little Barton&quot;. &quot;Hartshorn&quot; comes from a separate hamlet in the same parish and is thought to refer to the shape of the land locally: it lies in the shape of a deer&#x27;s horn.

==Manor==
Before the Norman Conquest of England Wilaf, a thegn of Earl Leofwine Godwinson, held the manor. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that it was one of the extensive landholdings of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. However, by then Odo had already been imprisoned for disobeying William I and forfeited his estates to the Crown.

In the 13th century both Nutley Abbey in Long Crendon and Osney Abbey in Oxford held land at Barton. Both abbeys retained their estates here until the dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s, when they were required to surrender them to the Crown. After the dissolution, Nutley&#x27;s land at Barton was granted to the same secular owner as the adjacent manor of Chetwode, and the two descended together until the 20th century.

Part of the manor house is 17th century and a stone on the west gable is inscribed with the date 1635. Surviving 17th century features include some mullioned windows, a fireplace, staircase, and panelling. Alterations and major extensions to the house made in 1903 and 1908 were designed by the architect was Robert Lorimer.

==Parish church==
The nave of the Church of England parish church of Saint James may be 13th century: it has a 13th-century lancet window in the west wall and a 13th-century doorway (not in its original position) in the south wall. The windows either side of the south door are 14th century, and so too may be the north door. The blocked west doorway is late 15th or early 16th century and in the north wall are two 16th century windows. The south porch may be 17th century. The chancel was added in the 19th century and the transepts in 1841.

==Economic history==

The parish&#x27;s common lands were enclosed by an Act of Parliament passed in 1812.

In 1899 the Great Central Railway completed its main line to London through the southernmost part of the parish. The nearest station was Finmere for Buckingham, which was just over the Oxfordshire county boundary on the main road between Buckingham and Bicester and only from Barton Hartshorn. The station was from Buckingham, more than from Finmere and was actually in Shelswell parish next to the village of Newton Purcell. In about 1922 the Great Central renamed the station Finmere. British Railways closed the station in 1963 and the line in 1966.

<doc id="394770" wikidata="Q706666" url="?curid=394770" title="Albert Kahn (architect)">
<text>Albert Kahn (March 21, 1869 – December 8, 1942) was an American architect noted for his collaborations with his brother Julius Kahn in designing industrial plant complexes such as the Ford River Rouge automobile complex. Based in Detroit, he also designed skyscrapers, office buildings, and mansions in the city and suburbs, as well as many buildings at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Kahn has been called the &quot;architect of Detroit&quot; as the designer of nearly 900 buildings in the city.

Kahn led an organization of hundreds of architect associates, and in 1937 designed 19% of all architect-designed industrial factories in the United States. Under a unique contract in 1929, he established a design and training office in Moscow, sending twenty-five staff there to train Soviet architects and engineers, and to design hundreds of industrial buildings under their first five-year plan. They trained more than 4,000 architects and engineers using Kahn&#x27;s concepts. In 1943, the Franklin Institute posthumously awarded Kahn the Frank P. Brown Medal.

==Early life and education==
Kahn was born on March 21, 1869, to a Jewish family in Rhaunen, in the Kingdom of Prussia, today in Germany. He received his early education in the school of Luxembourg. At age twelve in 1881, Kahn immigrated with his family to Detroit, Michigan. His father Joseph was trained as a rabbi; his mother Rosalie had a talent for the visual arts and music. Kahn had four brothers, including Moritz, who became an engineer, and Julius Kahn, an engineer and inventor, who later collaborated with him in his architectural firm. They also had two sisters, one of whom, Mollie Kahn Fuchs, who later worked closely with Julius to create a type of reinforced concrete that would later be patented. 

When the family immigrated to America, Kahn quickly learned English and went to Detroit public schools. In 1883, he got a job at the architectural business of Mason and Rice where he got his initial architectural training, working primarily on residences and bank buildings.

In 1891, at age 22, Kahn won a Rotch Traveling Fellowship to study in Europe, where he toured Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium with fellow student Henry Bacon, who later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. 

Kahn married Ernestine Krolik in 1896 and they had four children. Ernestine would later briefly serve as a vice president in her husband&#x27;s business, and often helped him with color and fabric selection in designs.

==Career==
Kahn left Mason and Rice in 1895, entering into a partnership with Alexander B. Trowbridge and George W. Nettleton known as Nettleton, Kahn &amp; Trowbridge. In 1902, Kahn formed a partnership with his brother Julius, a civil engineer. Later that year, Julius developed a novel and scientific method of reinforcing concrete with steel, making reinforced concrete construction practical and economical. After receiving a patent on the &quot;Kahn System&quot; of construction in 1903, Julius left Kahn&#x27;s firm and established the Trussed Concrete Steel Company, or Truscon, to market the product. Reinforced concrete allowed for much larger open spaces within factory interiors not obtainable with conventional wood construction and at a lower cost than steel frame construction. Concrete had other beneficial characteristics, such as far better protection from fire and greater load-bearing capacity. By 1905, hundreds of buildings within the United States were being constructed using the Kahn System, including the first reinforced concrete automobile plant, completed for the Cadillac Motor Car Company at 450 Amsterdam Street in TechTown, Detroit. Julius Kahn collaborated with his brother on the design of many industrial projects throughout the US constructed with reinforced concrete, particularly automobile factories, with the result that Kahn became widely known for his expertise in the construction of concrete industrial structures.

Kahn was also responsible for designing many of the buildings and houses built under the direction of the Hiram Walker family in Walkerville, Ontario, including Willistead Manor. Kahn&#x27;s interest in historically styled buildings is also seen in his houses in Detroit&#x27;s Indian Village, the Cranbrook House, the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House, and The Dearborn Inn, the world&#x27;s first airport hotel. Kahn&#x27;s firm designed the Art Deco Fisher Building in Detroit&#x27;s New Center area, a 28-story designated landmark. In 1929, the building was awarded a silver medal by the Architectural League of New York in the category of the year&#x27;s most beautiful commercial building. From 1917 to 1929, Kahn&#x27;s firm also designed the corporate headquarters for all three of the major Detroit daily newspapers and the General Motors building, at the time of its completion in 1922, the second largest office building in the world. His work was part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

=== Michigan ===

Henry Ford became interested in Kahn&#x27;s unique designs that showed many benefits. Ford had Kahn design Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Highland Park Ford Plant in 1909, for developing production techniques in the assembly line of manufacturing the Ford Model T on a large scale. In 1917, Kahn designed the half-mile-long Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan. That factory complex was developed into the largest manufacturing cluster of plants in the United States and later the largest industrial manufacturer in the world with a workforce of 120,000 employees.

Kahn also designed many of what are considered the classic buildings of the University of Michigan in the city of Ann Arbor. These include Angell Hall, Burton Memorial Tower, Hill Auditorium, Hatcher Graduate Library, and William L. Clements Library. Kahn said later in life that, of all the buildings he designed, he wanted most to be remembered for his work on the William L. Clements Library. Kahn frequently collaborated with architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. In all, Parducci worked on about 50 Kahn commissions, including banks, office buildings, newspaper buildings, mausoleums, hospitals, and private residences.

Kahn&#x27;s firm was able to adapt to the changing needs of World War I and designed numerous army airfields and naval bases for the United States government during the war. During World War II, Kahn and his firm were in charge of several of the U.S. government&#x27;s important construction projects that included aeronautical and tank arsenal plants. His 600-person office was involved in making Detroit industry part of America&#x27;s Arsenal of Democracy. Among others, the office designed the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, and the Willow Run Bomber Plant, Kahn&#x27;s last building, located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The Ford Motor Company mass-produced Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers here.

In 1937, Albert Kahn Associates was responsible for 19% of all architect-designed industrial factories in the United States. In 1941, Kahn received the eighth-highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $486,936, of which he paid 72% in tax. Kahn worked on more than 1,000 commissions from Henry Ford and hundreds from other automakers. Kahn designed showrooms for Ford Motor Company in several cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston.

As of 2020, approximately 60 Kahn buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Five of these (the Fisher Building, Ford River Rouge complex, Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, General Motors Building, and Highland Park Ford Plant) were designated National Historic Landmarks. Not all of Kahn&#x27;s works have been preserved. Cass Technical High School in Detroit, designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham and built by Kahn&#x27;s firm in 1922, was demolished in 2011, after vandals had stripped it of most of its fixtures. The Donovan Building, later occupied by Motown Records, was abandoned for decades and deteriorated. The city demolished it as part of its beautification plan before the 2006 Super Bowl XL. In Kalamazoo, Michigan, the Kahn designed Checker Cab Manufacturing plant was shuttered following the bankruptcy of Checker Motors Corporation, in 2009. It was leveled in 2015.

Fifteen Kahn buildings are recognized by official Michigan historical markers:
* Battle Creek Post Office
* The Dearborn Inn
* Detroit Arsenal Plant in Warren, Michigan
* Detroit Free Press Building
* Detroit News Building
* Detroit Urban League (Albert Kahn House)
* Eastern Liggett School
* Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House
* Fisher Building
* Ford Motor Company Lamp Factory
* Grosse Pointe Shores Village Hall
* Highland Park Ford Plant
* Packard Automotive Plant
* Packard Proving Grounds
* Willow Run

=== In the Soviet Union ===
On May 8, 1929, through an agreement signed with Kahn by Saul G. Bron, President of Amtorg, the Soviet government contracted Albert Kahn Associates to help design the Stalingrad Tractor Plant, the first tractor plant in the USSR. On January 9, 1930, a second contract with Kahn was signed for his firm to become consulting architects for all industrial construction in the Soviet Union. Under these contracts, during 1929 to 1932 and the Great Depression, Kahn&#x27;s firm established a design and training bureau in Moscow to train and supervise Soviet architects and engineers. This bureau, under the government&#x27;s &quot;Gosproektstroi&quot;, was headed by Moritz Kahn and 25 others of Kahn Associates staff, who worked in Moscow during this project. They trained more than 4,000 Soviet architects and engineers; and designed 521 plants and factories under the nation&#x27;s first five-year plan.

==Death and legacy==
Kahn died in Detroit on December 8, 1942. Many of his personal working papers and construction photographs are housed at University of Michigan&#x27;s Bentley History Library. His personal working library, the Albert Kahn Library Collection, is housed at Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan. The Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian house most of the family&#x27;s correspondence and other materials.

The life and works of Kahn were celebrated in an exhibition of photographs, drawings, and models at the Detroit Institute of Arts from September 15 to November 1, 1970. It commemorated the 75th anniversary of the architectural firm which was founded by Kahn. Many of Detroit&#x27;s leading industrialists who work in the buildings designed by Kahn were present at the celebration.

A staff writer for the Times Herald newspaper in 1970 wrote that Kahn was often called the father of industrial architecture. He was referred to as Architect of the Colossal by Reader&#x27;s Digest magazine. The science museum Franklin Institute in Philadelphia recognized him as an architectural pioneer and awarded him their gold medal. The American Institute of Architects awarded him two of their gold medals in his lifetime. The staff writer estimated that Kahn was the architect of two billion dollars worth of structures before his death in 1942. The committee on science and arts of the Detroit Institute of Arts noted that none of Kahn&#x27;s discoveries were ever patented, but instead were placed in the hands of architects and engineers engaged in construction during World Wars I and II. The 184 page catalogue put in book form called &quot;The Legacy of Albert Kahn&quot; consists of two essays on the works of Kahn, one by W. Hawkins Ferry the architectural writer and Honorary Curator of Architecture at the Detroit Institute of Arts and another written by Walter B. Sanders as a Professor of Architecture at the University of Michigan.

&quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; writer and historian John Gallagher notes that Kahn produced 1900 buildings, among them being the Fisher Building, the General Motors headquarters, the Ford River Rouge Complex, and many buildings on the campus of the University of Michigan. He points out that what was modern in 1920, like his automobile factories that he built between 1900 and 1920 were obsolete by 1990s standards and were being torn down. Some of his other buildings at that time no longer served the purpose for which they were constructed and were being remodeled for other uses.

<text>Joaquín Turina Pérez (9 December 188214 January 1949) was a Spanish composer of classical music.

==Biography==
Turina was born in Seville. He studied in Seville as well as in Madrid. He lived in Paris from 1905 to 1914 where he took composition lessons from Vincent d&#x27;Indy at the Schola Cantorum de Paris and studied the piano under Moritz Moszkowski. Like his countryman and friend, Manuel de Falla, while in Paris he familiarized himself with the impressionist composers Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy, whose music had a profound influence on his compositional practice.

On 10 December 1908 he married Obdulia Garzón and together they had five children. She was the dedicatee of the &quot;Danzas fantásticas,&quot; which he completed in 1919.

Along with Falla, he returned to Madrid in 1914, working as a composer, teacher and critic. On 28 March 1916, he joined the Madrid Symphony Orchestra at the Hotel Ritz of Madrid to perform the premiere of Falla&#x27;s revised orchestral version of &quot;El amor brujo.&quot; In the early months of 1929, he visited Havana, Cuba, where he gave a series of seven lectures at the Hispanic-Cuban Institute of Culture.

In 1931 he was made professor of composition at the Madrid Royal Conservatory. Among his notable pupils were Vicente Asencio and Celedonio Romero. He died in Madrid in 1949.

==Works==
:&quot;See: List of compositions by Joaquín Turina&quot;

His works include the operas &quot;Margot&quot; (1914) and &quot;Jardín de Oriente&quot; (1923), the &quot;Danzas fantásticas&quot; (1919, versions for piano and orchestra), &quot;La oración del torero&quot; (written first for a lute quartet, then string quartet, then string orchestra), chamber music, piano works, guitar pieces and songs. Much of his work shows the influence of traditional Andalusian music. He also wrote a short one-movement &quot;Rapsodia sinfónica&quot; (1931) for piano and orchestra. His music often conveys a feeling of rapture or exaltation. His guitar works include &quot;Fandanguillo&quot; and &quot;Hommage à Tárrega&quot;, which were written for Andrés Segovia. The dedicatee and/or first performer of a number of his piano works was José Cubiles.

During the 1920s and 1930s, he frequently visited Barcelona and Catalonia and interacted with various Catalan artists, critics and intellectuals, such as Manuel Clausells, Joan Lamote de Grignon, Eugenio d&#x27;Ors, Oleguer Junyent, Frank Marshall, Rafael Moragas, Jaime Pahissa and Santiago Rusiñol. He also collaborated with various musical institutions, such as the Associació Música da Camera, the Barcelona Municipal Band or the Pau Casals Orchestra. As a result of this relationship, he composed &quot;Evocaciones&quot;, a set of three pieces for piano that become a tribute to Catalonia and that include a sardana. On 23 October 1928, together with Pablo Casals, he premiered the transcription for a cello and piano «Jueves Santo a medianoche» (from the &quot;Seville&quot; suite) at the Palau de la Música Catalana.

<text>Black Label Society is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1998 by guitarist/singer Zakk Wylde. To date, the band has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums, one EP, and three video albums.

==History==
===&quot;Sonic Brew&quot; and Formation (1998–1999)===
In the early 1990s, Wylde had formed his own solo band Pride &amp; Glory, playing a mixture of bluesy Southern rock with heavy metal. However, they disbanded in December 1994 after having released only one album. Wylde subsequently recorded an acoustic solo album, &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; (1996). In May 1998, after limited commercial success with &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, Wylde and drummer Phil Ondich recorded what became Black Label Society&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sonic Brew&quot;. It was decided, rather than the album being another solo album for Wylde, that they would form a long term band. It was known from the start that Nick Catanese would be retained as the second guitarist in the band (Catanese previously toured as rhythm guitarist for the Book of Shadows tour). John DeServio, who previously worked with Wylde as a temporary replacement in Pride &amp; Glory, joined as the band&#x27;s bassist for the album&#x27;s tour.

&quot;Sonic Brew&quot; was released in Japan on October 28, 1998. Due to delays in signing with a record label (Spitfire Records), the album was not released in the rest of the world until May 4, 1999.

===Line-up changes and subsequent releases (1999–2007)===
The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Stronger Than Death&quot; followed in 2000, with DeServio being replaced by Steve Gibb. Craig Nunenmacher replaced Ondich in July 2000, with his debut recording with the band being the live album &quot;Alcohol Fueled Brewtality Live +5&quot;. This was followed by &quot;1919 Eternal&quot;, which was dedicated to Wylde&#x27;s father and was released in 2002. Steve Gibb was temporarily replaced by Mike Inez (Alice In Chains) during the Ozzfest 2001 tour, and then Robert Trujillo took over bass duties for the band the next year.

In 2003, Trujillo joined Metallica, leaving the bass position in Black Label Society open, which left room for Inez to rejoin the band for a short two-week tour, supporting the band&#x27;s album &quot;The Blessed Hellride&quot;. James LoMenzo joined the band in 2004 after the release of &quot;Hangover Music Vol. VI&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s last release for Spitfire Records.

On the first four studio albums, Wylde played every instrument, except for the drums, including vocals, guitars, piano, and bass guitar.

In 2005, after the band signed with Artemis Records, the album &quot;Mafia&quot; was released. In October, LoMenzo left the band (and joined Megadeth a few months later) and was replaced by the band&#x27;s original bassist, John DeServio. In 2006, the band left Artemis Records and signed to Roadrunner Records, releasing the album &quot;Shot to Hell&quot;.

In June 2007, Black Label Society parted ways with Roadrunner Records.

===Side bands and lineup changes (2007–present)===
In July 2007, band members DeServio and Catanese both signaled the start of new bands as Zakk Wylde toured with Ozzy Osbourne. Drummer Craig Nunenmacher left the band in February 2010, and was replaced by Will Hunt (of Dark New Day, Evanescence). Hunt&#x27;s first live performance with the band would be on July 24, 2010, at the first edition of the High Voltage Festival in London. 

On August 10, 2010, &quot;Order of the Black&quot;, their eighth studio album, was released. It reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

In 2011 the band toured in support of their new album. The Black Label Berzerkus tour started in Portland, Oregon, with Children of Bodom and Clutch sharing the main support slot and 2cents opening.

In March 2011, Will Hunt left the band to record with Evanescence, and Danzig drummer Johnny Kelly (formerly of Type O Negative) filled in for him for the rest of the tour, however in May 2011, Mike Froedge of doubleDrive and Catanese&#x27;s band Speed X joined the band.

Black Label Society released the compilation album &quot;The Song Remains Not the Same&quot; on May 3, 2011, via Entertainment One Music. The offering features unplugged versions of material from the album &quot;Order of the Black&quot;, as well as additional material recorded during the &quot;Order of the Black&quot; sessions. &quot;The Song Remains Not the Same&quot; was conceived, created and compiled by Zakk Wylde and the title is a nod to one of Wylde&#x27;s favorite bands, Led Zeppelin.

On September 14, 2011, Wylde introduced Breaking Benjamin&#x27;s Chad Szeliga as the band&#x27;s new drummer.

An interview with ESPN announced an acoustic DVD entitled &quot;Unblackened&quot;, in the works for 2012. The album was recorded during the Unblackened show at Club Nokia on March 6, 2013. 

On May 3, 2013, it was announced that Black Label Society would be included in the year&#x27;s installment of Gigantour, along with Megadeth, Device, Hellyeah, Newsted, and upstart band Death Division.

In August 2013, Zakk Wylde stated that he would begin writing a new studio album, and it would be scheduled for a 2014 release. On October 28, they debuted a new music video, a cover of Bill Withers &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;.

It was reported on December 2, 2013, that Nick Catanese had amicably parted from the band.

On January 1, 2014, Wylde announced via Facebook that Lizzy Borden guitarist Dario Lorina would be replacing Nick Catanese as rhythm guitarist. Lorina made his live debut with the band on April 16 in Seattle.

In 2014, Black Label Society played the main stage of Download Festival on the Friday at Donington Park in the UK.

On October 2, 2017, the band released the song &quot;Room of Nightmares&quot;, also announcing that they will be releasing their new album &quot;Grimmest Hits&quot; on January 19, 2018. On November 20, the band released another song from &quot;Grimmest Hits&quot; titled &quot;All That Once Shined&quot;.

On November 29, 2019, Black Label Society released a vinyl-only EP titled &quot;Nuns and Roaches&quot;. The release features six songs originally recorded in 1999.

In August 2021, the band announced their eleventh studio album, titled &quot;Doom Crew Inc.&quot;, to be released on November 26, 2021. The album&#x27;s lead single is titled &quot;Set You Free&quot;, which was selected by &quot;Loudwire&quot; as the 22nd-best metal song of 2021.

<text>The Language poets (or [[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|&quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;]] poets, after the magazine of that name) are an avant-garde group or tendency in United States poetry that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The poets included: Bernadette Mayer, Leslie Scalapino, Stephen Rodefer, Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Ron Silliman, Barrett Watten, Lyn Hejinian, Tom Mandel, Bob Perelman, Rae Armantrout, Alan Davies, Carla Harryman, Clark Coolidge, Hannah Weiner, Susan Howe, James Sherry, and Tina Darragh.

Language poetry emphasizes the reader&#x27;s role in bringing meaning out of a work. It plays down expression, seeing the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In more theoretical terms, it challenges the &quot;natural&quot; presence of a speaker behind the text; and emphasizes the disjunction and the materiality of the signifier. These poets favor prose poetry, especially in longer and non-narrative forms.

In developing their poetics, members of the Language school took as their starting point the emphasis on method evident in the modernist tradition, particularly as represented by Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, and Louis Zukofsky. Language poetry is an example of poetic postmodernism. Its immediate postmodern precursors were the New American poets, a term including the New York School, the Objectivist poets, the Black Mountain School, the Beat poets, and the San Francisco Renaissance.

Language poetry has been a controversial topic in American letters from the 1970s to the present. Even the name has been controversial: while a number of poets and critics have used the name of the journal to refer to the group, many others have chosen to use the term, when they used it at all, without the equals signs. The terms &quot;language writing&quot; and &quot;language-centered writing&quot; are also commonly used, and are perhaps the most generic terms. None of the poets associated with the tendency has used the equal signs when referring to the writing collectively. Its use in some critical articles can be taken as an indicator of the author&#x27;s outsider status. There is also debate about whether or not a writer can be called a language poet without being part of that specific coterie; is it a style or is it a group of people? In his introduction to &quot;San Francisco Beat: Talking With the Poets&quot; (San Francisco, City Lights, 2001 p.vii) David Meltzer writes: &quot;The language cadres never truly left college. They&#x27;ve always been good students, and now they&#x27;re excellent teachers. The professionalization and rationalization of poetry in the academy took hold and routinized the teaching and writing of poetry.&quot; Later in the volume (p. 128) poet Joanne Kyger comments: &quot;The Language school I felt was a kind of an alienating intellectualization of the energies of poetry. It carried it away from the source. It may have been a housecleaning from confessional poetry, but I found it a sterilization of poetry.&quot; 

Online writing samples of many language poets can be found on internet sites, including blogs and sites maintained by authors and through gateways such as the Electronic Poetry Center, PennSound, and UbuWeb.

==History==

The movement has been highly decentralized. On the West Coast, an early seed of language poetry was the launch of &quot;This&quot; magazine, edited by Robert Grenier and Barrett Watten, in 1971. &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;, edited by Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein, ran from 1978 to 1982, and was published in New York. It featured poetics, forums on writers in the movement, and themes such as &quot;The Politics of Poetry&quot; and &quot;Reading Stein&quot;. Ron Silliman&#x27;s poetry newsletter &quot;Tottel&#x27;s&quot; (1970–81), Bruce Andrews&#x27;s selections in a special issue of &quot;Toothpick&quot; (1973), as well as Lyn Hejinian&#x27;s editing of Tuumba Press, and James Sherry&#x27;s editing of &quot;Roof&quot; magazine also contributed to the development of ideas in language poetry. The first significant collection of language-centered poetics was the article, &quot;The Politics of the Referent,&quot; edited by Steve McCaffery for the Toronto-based publication, &quot;Open Letter&quot; (1977).

In an essay from the first issue of &quot;This&quot;, Grenier declared: &quot;I HATE SPEECH&quot;. Grenier&#x27;s ironic statement (itself a speech act), and a questioning attitude to the referentiality of language, became central to language poets. Ron Silliman, in the introduction to his anthology &quot;In the American Tree,&quot; appealed to a number of young U.S. poets who were dissatisfied with the work of the Black Mountain and Beat poets.

The range of poetry published that focused on &quot;language&quot; in &quot;This,&quot; &quot;Tottel&#x27;s,&quot; &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;, and also in several other key publications and essays of the time, established the field of discussion that would emerge as Language (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E) poetry.

During the 1970s, a number of magazines published poets who would become associated with the Language movement. These included &quot;A Hundred Posters&quot; (edited by Alan Davies), &quot;Big Deal,&quot; &quot;Dog City,&quot; &quot;Hills,&quot; &quot;Là Bas,&quot; &quot;MIAM,&quot; &quot;Oculist Witnesses,&quot; &quot;QU,&quot; and &quot;Roof.&quot; &quot;Poetics Journal,&quot; which published writings in poetics and was edited by Lyn Hejinian and Barrett Watten, appeared from 1982 to 1998. Significant early gatherings of Language writing included Bruce Andrews&#x27;s selection in &quot;Toothpick&quot; (1973); Silliman&#x27;s selection &quot;The Dwelling Place: 9 Poets&quot; in &quot;Alcheringa,&quot; (1975), and Charles Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;A Language Sampler,&quot; in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; (1982).

Certain poetry reading series, especially in New York, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, were important venues for the performance of this new work, and for the development of dialogue and collaboration among poets. Most important were Ear Inn reading series in New York, founded in 1978 by Ted Greenwald and Charles Bernstein and later organized through James Sherry&#x27;s Segue Foundation and curated by Mitch Highfill, Jeanne Lance, Andrew Levy, Rob Fitterman, Laynie Brown, Alan Davies, and The Poetry Society of New York; Folio Books in Washington, D.C., founded by Doug Lang; and the Grand Piano reading series in San Francisco, which was curated by Barrett Watten, Ron Silliman, Tom Mandel, Rae Armantrout, Ted Pearson, Carla Harryman, and Steve Benson at various times.

Poets, some of whom have been mentioned above, who were associated with the first wave of Language poetry include: Rae Armantrout, Stephen Rodefer (1940–2015), Steve Benson, Abigail Child, Clark Coolidge, Tina Darragh, Alan Davies, Carla Harryman, P. Inman, Lynne Dryer, Madeline Gins, Michael Gottlieb, Fanny Howe, Susan Howe, Tymoteusz Karpowicz, Jackson Mac Low (1922–2004), Tom Mandel, Bernadette Mayer, Steve McCaffery, Michael Palmer, Ted Pearson, Bob Perelman, Nick Piombino, Peter Seaton (1942–2010), Joan Retallack, Erica Hunt, James Sherry, Jean Day, Kit Robinson, Ted Greenwald, Leslie Scalapino (1944–2010), Diane Ward, Rosmarie Waldrop, and Hannah Weiner (1928–1997). This list accurately reflects the high proportion of female poets across the spectrum of the Language writing movement. African-American poets associated with the movement include Hunt, Nathaniel Mackey, and Harryette Mullen.

==Poetics of language writing: Theory and practice==
Language poetry emphasizes the reader&#x27;s role in bringing meaning out of a work. It developed in part in response to what poets considered the uncritical use of expressive lyric sentiment among earlier poetry movements. In the 1950s and 1960s, certain groups of poets had followed William Carlos Williams in his use of idiomatic American English rather than what they considered the &#x27;heightened&#x27;, or overtly poetic language favored by the New Criticism movement. New York School poets like Frank O&#x27;Hara and the Black Mountain group emphasized both speech and everyday language in their poetry and poetics.

In contrast, some of the Language poets emphasized metonymy, synecdoche and extreme instances of paratactical structures in their compositions, which, even when employing everyday speech, created a far different texture. The result is often alien and difficult to understand at first glance, which is what Language poetry intends: for the reader to participate in creating the meaning of the poem.

Watten&#x27;s &amp; Grenier&#x27;s magazine This (and This Press which Watten edited), along with the magazine &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;, published work by notable Black Mountain poets such as Robert Creeley and Larry Eigner. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten has emphasized the discontinuity between the New American poets, whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein has emphasized the expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.

Gertrude Stein, particularly in her writing after &quot;Tender Buttons,&quot; and Louis Zukofsky, in his book-length poem &quot;A,&quot; are the modernist poets who most influenced the Language school. In the postwar period, John Cage, Jackson Mac Low, and poets of the New York School (John Ashbery, Frank O&#x27;Hara, Ted Berrigan) and Black Mountain School (Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, and Robert Duncan) are most recognizable as precursors to the Language poets. Many of these poets used procedural methods based on mathematical sequences and other logical organising devices to structure their poetry. This practice proved highly useful to the language group. The application of process, especially at the level of the sentence, was to become the basic tenet of language praxis. Stein&#x27;s influence was related to her own frequent use of language divorced from reference in her own writings. The language poets also drew on the philosophical works of Ludwig Wittgenstein, especially the concepts of language-games, meaning as use, and family resemblance among different uses, as the solution to the Problem of universals.

===Language poetry in the early 21st century===
In many ways, what Language poetry is is still being determined. Most of the poets whose work falls within the bounds of the Language school are still alive and still active contributors. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Language poetry was widely received as a significant movement in innovative poetry in the U.S., a trend accentuated by the fact that some of its leading proponents took up academic posts in the Poetics, Creative Writing and English Literature departments in prominent universities (University of Pennsylvania, SUNY Buffalo, Wayne State University, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Diego, University of Maine, the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop).

Language poetry also developed affiliations with literary scenes outside the States, notably England, Canada (through the Kootenay school of writing in Vancouver), France, the USSR, Brazil, Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, and Australia. It had a particularly interesting relation to the UK &quot;avant-garde&quot;: in the 1970s and 1980s there were extensive contacts between American Language poets and veteran UK writers like Tom Raworth and Allen Fisher, or younger figures such as Caroline Bergvall, Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan, cris cheek, and Ken Edwards (whose magazine &quot;Reality Studios&quot; was instrumental in the transatlantic dialogue between American and UK &quot;avant-garde&quot;s). Other writers, such as J.H. Prynne and those associated with the so-called &quot;Cambridge&quot; poetry scene (Rod Mengham, Douglas Oliver, Peter Riley) were perhaps more skeptical about language poetry and its associated polemics and theoretical documents, though Geoff Ward wrote a book about the phenomenon.

A second generation of poets influenced by the Language poets includes Eric Selland (also a noted translator of modern Japanese poetry), Lisa Robertson, Juliana Spahr, the Kootenay School poets, conceptual writing, Flarf collectives, and many others.

A significant number of women poets, and magazines and anthologies of innovative women&#x27;s poetry, have been associated with language poetry on both sides of the Atlantic. They often represent a distinct set of concerns. Among the poets are Leslie Scalapino, Madeline Gins, Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, Rae Armantrout, Jean Day, Hannah Weiner, Tina Darragh, Erica Hunt, Lynne Dreyer, Harryette Mullen, Beverly Dahlen, Johanna Drucker, Abigail Child, and Karen Mac Cormack; among the magazines HOW/ever, later the e-based journal HOW2; and among the anthologies &quot;Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America &amp; the UK,&quot; edited by Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan for Reality Street Editions in London (1996) and Mary Margaret Sloan&#x27;s &quot;Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women&quot; (Jersey City: Talisman Publishers, 1998).

Ten of the Language poets, each of whom at one time curated the reading series at the San Francisco coffee house of that name, collaborated to write &quot;The Grand Piano&quot;, &quot;an experiment in collective autobiography&quot; published in ten small volumes. Editing and communication for the collaboration was accomplished over email. Authors of The Grand Piano were Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, Rae Armantrout, Tom Mandel, Ron Silliman, Barrett Watten, Steve Benson, Bob Perelman, Ted Pearson, and Kit Robinson. An eleventh member of the project, Alan Bernheimer, served as an archivist and contributed one essay on the filmmaker Warren Sonbert. The authors of The Grand Piano sought to reconnect their writing practices and to &quot;recall and contextualize events from the period of the late 1970s.&quot;
 Each volume of &quot;The Grand Piano&quot; features essays by all ten authors in different sequence; often responding to prompts and problems arising from one another&#x27;s essays in the series.

Some poets, such as Norman Finkelstein, have stressed their own ambiguous relationship to &quot;Language poetry&quot;, even after decades of fruitful engagement. Finkelstein, in a discussion with Mark Scroggins about &quot;The Grand Piano&quot;, points to a &quot;risk&quot; when previously marginalized poets try to write their own literary histories, &quot;not the least of which is a self-regard bordering on narcissism&quot;.

<text>Roger A. Morse, Ph.D. (July 5, 1927 - May 12, 2000) was an American bee biologist who taught many beekeepers both the rudiments and the finer practices, through his research and publications. During his long career, three new parasites of the honeybee, acarine mite, varroa mite, and African small hive beetle were introduced to the United States. These, along with the Africanized honeybee and pesticide kills were all important beekeeping issues. Morse was extensively involved in research on each of these and provided guidance to the beekeeping industry.

== Education and career ==

Morse was born in Saugerties, New York, and join the U.S. Army at age seventeen and served from 1944 to 1947. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cornell University in 1950, his masters in 1953 and his doctorate in 1955, and did postgraduate work with the State Plant Board in Gainesville, Florida. After a brief stint as assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, he returned to Cornell University where he remained until retirement. Morse taught a very popular introductory course on beekeeping, which was available to any student as an elective. He was made chairman of the entomology department in 1986, until 1989. In 1989 he was made a fellow of the Entomological Society of America, and had been a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science since 1975. He also served as visiting professor at the University of Helsinki, Finland, the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and the University of the Philippines, Los Baños.

== Publications ==

Morse was a prolific writer of numerous books and magazine articles. He also edited and made contributions to a number of collective works. This is a partial list.

<text>Ozzfest was an annual music festival tour of the United States and sometimes Europe and later Japan, featuring performances by many heavy metal and hard rock musical groups. It was founded by Sharon Osbourne and her husband Ozzy Osbourne, both of whom also organised each yearly tour with their son Jack Osbourne, and was held almost annually between 1996 and 2018. The Ozzfest tour featured bands of a variety of genres within heavy metal and hard rock, including alternative metal, thrash metal, industrial metal, metalcore, hardcore punk, deathcore, nu metal, death metal, post-hardcore, gothic metal and black metal. Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath played the tour several times over the years.

==History==
===1996–1999: early years===
The festival was created in 1996 by Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, after she was rebuffed by Lollapalooza when she tried to get Ozzy on that festival circuit. The tour was well-received, which prompted the festival to become a yearly occurrence.

The first Ozzfest was not a national tour, but rather a two-day festival held in Phoenix, Arizona, and Devore, California, on 25 and 26 October 1996 respectively. Ozzfest Live, a compilation of ten live tracks recorded during this festival, was released on April 29, 1997.

In 1997, there were large protests outside of the festival to cancel Marilyn Manson&#x27;s performance. However, no dates were cancelled. There were also protests of a similar nature in 2001, following the Columbine High School massacre, which some groups had blamed on Marilyn Manson.

In 1998, Ozzfest ventured outside the United States for the first time into the United Kingdom, which featured a different line-up of bands. The festival would eventually return to the UK in 2001 and 2002.

The 1998 US Tour also featured for the first time an Ozzfest web site. Photographs were made during the tour using an early generation Sony Mavica FD-7 digital camera and uploaded each night after the show, and a tour diary was kept from the road.

The concert on 18 July 1998 at Float Rite Park was merged with Warped Tour 1998. Some 39,000 fans were at the 12-hour, six-stage, 48-band event.

===2000–2006: commercial success===
In the early 2000s, artists and bands including Slipknot, Kittie, Pantera, Marilyn Manson, Mudvayne, Godsmack, Rob Zombie, Incubus, Linkin Park, System of a Down, Chevelle, P.O.D., Papa Roach and Disturbed played the yearly music festival. Two compilation albums of the Ozzfest tour were released, one covering select 2001 performances and another for 2002.

On-stage footage of the Ozzfest 2004 tour was shown on MTV, as Ozzy and Sharon hosted a show on the network titled &quot;Battle for Ozzfest&quot; where they chose eight out of hundreds of bands to compete for a spot on the following year&#x27;s Ozzfest. Ozzy selected one member from each chosen band to &quot;tag along&quot; on the tour. Each contestant had to complete numerous challenges to improve his/her band&#x27;s chances of winning the contest. Occasionally, meetings would be held and certain contestants would be eliminated for various reasons. The person who prevailed as the winner and guaranteed his band&#x27;s spot on the Ozzfest tour was Marc Serrano from metalcore act A Dozen Furies. Serrano had appeared at Ozzfest the year prior with his former band Ünloco.

At Iron Maiden&#x27;s last Ozzfest performance, on 20 August 2005 at the Hyundai Pavilion at Glen Helen in San Bernardino, California, several detrimental events took place. During the first song, several members of the crowd, brought on by Sharon Osbourne, bombarded the English metal band Iron Maiden with eggs, bottle caps and ice after vocalist Bruce Dickinson allegedly ridiculed Ozzy&#x27;s need for a teleprompter during his performances, as well as the Osbourne family&#x27;s ventures into reality television (&quot;The Osbournes&quot;, &quot;Battle for Ozzfest&quot;). During three of Iron Maiden&#x27;s songs, the P.A. system was switched off, cutting power to Dickinson&#x27;s microphone and then to all the band&#x27;s instruments. During the concert, Bruce Dickinson can be heard accusing the festival&#x27;s organizers of deliberately cutting off the band&#x27;s power. On Iron Maiden&#x27;s departure, Sharon Osbourne came on stage to make a few statements, telling the audience that she &quot;absolutely loved Iron Maiden&quot; but thought that Dickinson is a &quot;prick.&quot; Rod Smallwood, manager for Iron Maiden, issued a statement shortly after the debacle condemning the attack on the band. In 2006, Bruce Dickinson commented, &quot;Did I have a go at Ozzy and Black Sabbath? No. Why would I? But I do find &quot;The Osbournes&quot; TV series loathsome, and the whole cult of reality TV celebrities disgusting.&quot; In response to claims that he had apologised to Ozzy for Dickinson&#x27;s behaviour, Steve Harris stated &quot;No I didn&#x27;t [apologise]. What I actually said was that, if there was anything to apologise for, then I&#x27;d do it. But that was twisted around to seem like I&#x27;d said sorry – that never happened!&quot;

===2007–2008===
On 7 February 2007, it was announced that tickets to Ozzfest 2007 would be offered free of charge, dubbing the 2007 Ozzfest as &quot;free fest.&quot; Tickets were made available through sponsor websites, the Ozzfest web site and to those buying an advance copy of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s new release, &quot;Black Rain&quot;.

Sponsorship money provided the revenue for the tour, but organizers did not pay any of the bands appearing. Ozzy Osbourne returned to the headlining slot on the tour after only headlining the second stage in 2006. Ozzfest 2007 featured well-established acts such as Lamb of God, Static-X, and Hatebreed.

There were problems with distribution of the free tickets. Fans were given codes to receive tickets through the official Ozzfest website, but due to the heavy load on Live Nation&#x27;s secure servers, there were issues with ticket redemption. Another problem was that many &quot;eBay scalpers&quot; charged fans to pay for the free tickets, often turning out to be unusable duplicates of other tickets. Then, on 26 July, Ozzfest gave away free tickets without requiring its &quot;redemption code&quot; previously required.

At the show of 16 August 2007 in Holmdel, New Jersey, at the PNC Bank Arts Center, controversy was generated as 83 attendees were arrested at the show, most of them underage and arrested prior to 8:00. In addition, two men died, one after overdosing on alcohol and energy drinks.

Questions over whether the event would be held in 2008 began when in April that year Ozzy Osbourne announced that he would be headlining the Canadian Monsters of Rock festival. The 2008 version of the festival took place for only one date at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, Texas on 9 August 2008. The line-up featured Metallica and Ozzy Osbourne as the headliner bands, as well as other acts such as Jonathan Davis (frontman of Korn), Sevendust, DevilDriver, Serj Tankian (frontman of System of a Down), Cavalera Conspiracy, Shadows Fall, Apocalyptica and In This Moment. Along with the two main stages was a third, named the Texas Stage, which, according to Sharon Osbourne, featured such Texas-based bands as The Sword, Drowning Pool, Goatwhore, Soilent Green and Rigor Mortis.

The Canadian Version of &quot;The Monsters of Rock&quot; was held exclusively on 26 July 2008 at the McMahon Stadium located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It was also scheduled as a &quot;one time only&quot; event. The main attraction for the festival of heavy metal and mayhem were metal giants Judas Priest and the headliner, Ozzy Osbourne. In addition, various other &quot;big league&quot; heavy metal outfits attended the festivities. The following bands preceded the two main attractions: Serj Tankian, Hatebreed, Cavalera Conspiracy (featuring current frontman of Soulfly, and former frontman of Sepultura, Max Cavalera), Shadows Fall, Canadian metal unit Voivod, Testament, 3 Inches of Blood, Priestess, Zimmers Hole, and Dillinger Escape Plan.

<text>The Physics Analysis Workstation (PAW) is an interactive, scriptable computer software tool for data analysis and graphical presentation in high-energy physics.

The development of this software tool started at CERN in 1986, it was optimized for the processing of very large amounts of data. It was based on and intended for inter-operation with components of CERNLIB, an extensive collection of Fortran libraries.

PAW had been a standard tool in high energy physics for decades, yet was essentially unmaintained. Despite continuing popularity as of 2008, it has been losing ground to the C++-based ROOT package. Conversion tutorials exist. In 2014, development and support were stopped.

==Sample script==

PAW uses its own scripting language. Here is sample code (with its actual output), which can be used to plot data gathered in files.

<text>36 (thirty-six) is the natural number following 35 and preceding 37.

==In mathematics==
36 is both the square of six, and the eighth triangular number or the sum of the first eight non-zero positive integers, which makes 36 the first non-trivial square triangular number. Aside from being the smallest square triangular number other than 1, it is also the only triangular number (other than 1) whose square root is also a triangular number. 36 is also the eighth refactorable number, as it has exactly nine positive divisors, and 9 is one of them; in fact, it is the smallest positive integer with at least nine divisors, which leads 36 to be the 7th highly composite number. It is the sum of the fourth pair of twin-primes (17 + 19), and the 18th Harshad number in decimal, as it is divisible by the sum of its digits (9).

It is the smallest number formula_1 with exactly eight solutions (37, 57, 63, 74, 76, 108, 114, 126) to the Euler totient function formula_2. Adding up some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 6, 12, and 18) gives 36; hence, it is also the eighth semiperfect number.

This number is the sum of the cubes of the first three positive integers and also the product of the squares of the first three positive integers.

36 is the number of degrees in the interior angle of each tip of a regular pentagram.

The thirty-six officers problem is a mathematical puzzle with no solution.

The number of possible outcomes (not summed) in the roll of two distinct dice.

36 is the largest numeric base that some computer systems support because it exhausts the numerals, 0–9, and the letters, A-Z. See Base 36.

The truncated cube and the truncated octahedron are Archimedean solids with 36 edges.

The number of domino tilings of a 4×4 checkerboard is 36.

Since it is possible to find sequences of 36 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member, 36 is an Erdős–Woods number.

The sum of the integers from 1 to 36 is 666 (see number of the beast).

36 is also a Tridecagonal number.

The cosine of an angle of 36 degrees is half the golden ratio. This is equivalent to cos(/5) and sin(54). The point of the golden triangle is 36 degrees.

== In religion ==
* Jewish tradition holds that the number 36 has had special significance since the beginning of time: According to the Midrash, the light created by God on the first day of creation shone for exactly 36 hours; it was replaced by the light of the Sun that was created on the Fourth Day. The Torah commands 36 times to love, respect and protect the stranger. Furthermore, in every generation there are 36 righteous people (the &quot;Lamed Vav Tzadikim&quot;) in whose merit the world continues to exist. In the modern celebration of Hanukkah, 36 candles are kindled in the menorah over the eight days of that holiday (not including the &quot;shamash&quot; candle).

== In culture ==
* In French-speaking countries, 36 is often used as a placeholder number.

<text>39 (thirty-nine) is the natural number following 38 and preceding 40.

== In mathematics ==

*39 is the 12th distinct semiprime and the 4th in the (3.q) family. It is the last member of the third distinct semiprime pair (38,39).
*39 has an aliquot sum of 17, which is a prime. 39 is the 4th member of the 17-aliquot tree within an aliquot sequence of one composite numbers (39,17,1,0) to the Prime in the 17-aliquot tree. 
*It is a perfect totient number.
*39 is the sum of five consecutive primes (3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13) and also is the product of the first and the last of those consecutive primes. Among small semiprimes only three other integers (10, 155, and 371) share this attribute. 39 also is the sum of the first three powers of 3 (3 + 3 + 3). Given 39, the Mertens function returns 0.
*39 is the smallest natural number which has three partitions into three parts which all give the same product when multiplied: {25, 8, 6}, {24, 10, 5}, {20, 15, 4}.

*39 is a Perrin number, coming after 17, 22, 29 (it is the sum of the first two mentioned).
*Since the greatest prime factor of 392 + 1 = 1522 is 761, which is more than 39 twice, 39 is a Størmer number.
*The F26A graph is a symmetric graph with 39 edges.

<doc id="394784" wikidata="Q369099" url="?curid=394784" title="Kevin DuBrow">
<text>Kevin Mark DuBrow (October 29, 1955 – November 19, 2007) was an American singer, best known as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Quiet Riot from 1975 until 1987, and again from 1993 until his death in 2007.
==Early life, photography work and family==
Kevin DuBrow was born to Laura and Alvin Dubrow. He was raised in Los Angeles with his younger brother, Terry, who went on to become a plastic surgeon and TV personality. At age 13, Kevin and his family eventually settled in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys. DuBrow was raised Jewish and had the nickname &quot;Butch&quot; growing up.

DuBrow learned to play 12-string guitar, and his first band consisted of 11-year-olds who played only one gig, to an audience of senior citizens who were not particularly fond of rock music. By the time he was in his mid-teens, he had developed an appreciation for a number of British rock acts including the Small Faces, Queen, Spooky Tooth, Rod Stewart and Humble Pie. Singer Steve Marriott would leave the biggest impact on DuBrow and act as a compass in his musical career.
DuBrow enjoyed a hobby of photography in his teenage years, often taking photos at rock &#x27;n roll concerts from 1969 to 1975. He became proficient enough as a photographer that he was soon selling his photos to rock magazines for publication, including &quot;Rock&quot; and &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine. Among the acts he photographed were Jeff Beck, Robin Trower, and Mott the Hoople.

Through his photography work, he became friends with producer Ron Sobol, and the two traded photographs that they shot at concerts. Not long after Dubrow photographed Rod Stewart at a concert in 1970, he said he realized he wanted to be on the other side of the lens. He once commented: &quot;shooting concerts is what made me become a singer. I saw Rod Stewart in &#x27;70. I was taking pictures, and I thought, &#x27;Wow, I want to be up there! I don&#x27;t wanna be behind the camera.&quot;

==Career==

===With Quiet Riot===
Quiet Riot was formed by Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni (who would later be replaced by Rudy Sarzo) in 1975, who recruited DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth. This lineup disbanded in 1979 when Rhoads went on to join Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band, with Rhoads personally enlisting Greg Leon as his replacement. For a time the band&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;DuBrow&quot;, which had a rotating lineup of members including Leon, Chuck Wright, Frankie Banali, with brothers Tony and Carlos Cavazo.

After the death of Rhoads in a plane crash in 1982, while on tour with Osbourne, DuBrow changed the name of the band back to Quiet Riot. Rudy Sarzo, who had also joined Ozzy Osbourne, left Osbourne&#x27;s band and rejoined Quiet Riot shortly before the release of &quot;Metal Health&quot;, which went to the top of the charts, making Quiet Riot the first metal band to achieve number one status on their (U.S. release) debut album. Their singles included &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; (originally written and recorded by English band Slade in 1973), and &quot;Metal Health (Bang Your Head)&quot;.

In February 1987, DuBrow was fired from Quiet Riot. “It wasn’t the band that wanted him out,” said drummer Frankie Banali in 2013. “It was management and the label. But it took the band to make the change.” However, DuBrow had a habit of publicly bad-mouthing other bands, which alienated a lot of musicians and fans, and also caused problems for Quiet Riot members (bassist Rudy Sarzo was famously punched in the face by Ozzy Osbourne after DuBrow publicly insulted the English singer). Another factor cited in the decision to fire DuBrow was his excessive drinking and drug use. “We all indulged,&quot; said Banali, &quot;but Kevin could be told nothing by no one, and his lifestyle choices had made it impossible for us to continue with him.” 

Shortly after his firing from Quiet Riot, DuBrow signed with Kim Richards for personal management. With Richards&#x27; help, DuBrow formed and began recording with a new band named Little Women. Richards, who was at that time working on the soundtrack for the Blake Edwards film &quot;Switch&quot;, arranged for the DuBrow-penned &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; to be included on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack.

In 1991, DuBrow regrouped with his former Quiet Riot bandmate Carlos Cavazo alongside Kenny Hillery and Pat Ashby in a new band called Heat, (Quiet Riot had continued on in 1987 with new singer Paul Shortino of Rough Cutt but by this time had disbanded). In June 1991, Heat renamed themselves Quiet Riot. Quiet Riot continued through the 90s in several different incarnations, including a full reunion with the &quot;Metal Health&quot;-era line-up. They released the albums &quot;Terrified&quot; (1993), &quot;Down to the Bone&quot; (1995), &quot;Alive and Well&quot; (1999) and &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; (2001).

During 2006, Quiet Riot worked on a new studio album that was expected to be released in either 2006 or 2007. The band stated that they had set no timetable for the release of the album, that they were financing the project themselves, and that it would be released when they saw fit and on their terms. The album, &quot;Rehab&quot;, was released on October 3, 2006. The lineup on the album was DuBrow, Banali, Tony Franklin, and Neil Citron. Singer Glenn Hughes also made a guest vocal appearance on the album.

===Other projects===
In 2004, after Quiet Riot&#x27;s 2003 breakup, DuBrow recorded a collection of cover versions for his first solo album, &quot;In for the Kill&quot;. The album was recorded in DuBrow&#x27;s home in Las Vegas, Nevada.

DuBrow also worked as a morning DJ for the Rock Station in Las Vegas, KOMP 92.3 on the morning show alongside longstanding host Craig Williams. Talk of show syndication had been heavily rumored but DuBrow departed the show to pursue touring with Quiet Riot.

==Personal life==

DuBrow dated Las Vegas radio DJ Lark Williams for seven years, breaking up shortly before his death.

===Death===
On November 25, 2007, DuBrow was found deceased at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada. Friends had been unable to contact DuBrow for a week and he failed to show up for Thanksgiving dinner hosted by his friend Glenn Hughes. According to Hughes, DuBrow had told him some ten days before that he had wanted to make adjustments in his lifestyle. The cause of death was revealed to be an overdose by a combination of cocaine, sleeping pill Zolpidem, painkillers, and alcohol. It was also determined that he had died six days earlier before being found. Nevertheless, his grave marker labels his death, &quot;Nov. 25, 2007&quot;.
In an email to Spain&#x27;s The Metal Circus, Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali wrote: &quot;I can&#x27;t even find the words to say. Please respect my privacy as I mourn the passing and honor the memory of my dearest friend Kevin DuBrow.&quot; DuBrow was buried at Pacific View Cemetery in Corona del Mar, California next to his stepfather Harold Mandell. A rabbi presided over his funeral service on November 30, 2007.

<doc id="394787" wikidata="Q1809613" url="?curid=394787" title="Drill string">
<text>A drill string on a drilling rig is a column, or string, of drill pipe that transmits drilling fluid (via the mud pumps) and torque (via the kelly drive or top drive) to the drill bit. The term is loosely applied to the assembled collection of the smuggler pool, drill collars, tools and drill bit. The drill string is hollow so that drilling fluid can be pumped down through it and circulated back up the annulus (the void between the drill string and the casing/open hole).

== Components ==

The drill string is typically made up of three sections:

* Bottom hole assembly (BHA)
* Transition pipe, which is often heavyweight drill pipe (HWDP)
* Drill pipe

=== Bottom hole assembly (BHA) ===

The Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) is made up of: a drill bit, which is used to break up the rock formations; drill collars, which are heavy, thick-walled tubes used to apply weight to the drill bit; and drilling stabilizers, which keep the assembly centered in the hole. The BHA may also contain other components such as a downhole motor and rotary steerable system (RSS), measurement while drilling (MWD), and logging while drilling (LWD) tools. The components are joined together using rugged threaded connections. Short &quot;subs&quot; are used to connect items with dissimilar threads.

=== Transition pipe ===

Heavyweight drill pipe (HWDP) may be used to make the transition between the drill collars and drill pipe. The function of the HWDP is to provide a flexible transition between the drill collars and the drill pipe. This helps to reduce the number of fatigue failures seen directly above the BHA. A secondary use of HWDP is to add additional weight to the drill bit. HWDP is most often used as weight on the bit in deviated wells. The HWDP may be directly above the collars in the angled section of the well, or the HWDP may be found before the kick-off point in a shallower section of the well.

=== Drill pipe ===

Drill pipe makes up the majority of the drill string back up to the surface. Each drill pipe comprises a long tubular section with a specified outside diameter (e.g. 3 1/2 inch, 4 inch, 5 inch, 5 1/2 inch, 5 7/8 inch, 6 5/8 inch). At each end of the drill pipe, tubular larger-diameter portions called the tool joints are located. One end of the drill pipe has a male (&quot;pin&quot;) connection whilst the other has a female (&quot;box&quot;) connection. The tool joint connections are threaded which allows for the mating of each drill pipe segment to the next segment.

== Running a drill string ==

Most components in a drill string are manufactured in 31-foot lengths (range 2) although they can also be manufactured in 46 foot lengths (range 3). Each 31-foot component is referred to as a joint. Typically two, three or four joints are joined together to make a stand. Modern onshore rigs are capable of handling ~90 ft stands (often referred to as a triple).

Pulling the drill string out of or running the drill string into the hole is referred to as tripping. Drill pipe, HWDP and collars are typically racked back in stands in to the monkeyboard which is a component of the derrick if they are to be run back into the hole again after, say, changing the bit. The disconnect point (&quot;break&quot;) is varied each subsequent round trip so that after three trips every connection has been broken apart and later made up again with fresh pipe dope applied.

== Stuck drill string ==

A stuck drill string can be caused by many situations.

* Packing-off due to cuttings settling back into the wellbore when circulation is stopped.
* Differentially when there is a large difference between formation pressure and wellbore pressure. The drill string is pushed against one side of the well bore. The force required to pull the string along the wellbore in this occurrence is a function of the total contact surface area, the pressure difference and the friction factor.
* Keyhole sticking occurs mechanically as a result of pulling up into doglegs when tripping.
* Adhesion due to not moving it for a significant amount of time.

Once the tubular member is stuck, there are many techniques used to extract the pipe. The tools and expertise are normally supplied by an oilfield service company. Two popular tools and techniques are the oilfield jar and the surface resonant vibrator. Below is a history of these tools along with how they operate.

===Jars===

==== History ====

The mechanical success of cable tool drilling has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, in the salt well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received a patent for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well drilling. Later, using jars, the cable tool system was able to efficiently meet the demands of drilling wells for oil.

The jars were improved over time, especially at the hands of the oil drillers, and reached the most useful and workable design by the 1870s, due to another patent received in 1868 by Edward Guillod of Titusville, Pennsylvania, which addressed the use of steel on the jars&#x27; surfaces that were subject to the greatest wear. Many years later, in the 1930s, very strong steel alloy jars were made.

A set of jars consisted of two interlocking links which could telescope. In 1880 they had a play of about 13 inches such that the upper link could be lifted 13 inches before the lower link was engaged. This engagement occurred when the cross-heads came together. Today, there are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottom hole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder,
imparting an impact load.

In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling. Jars are designed to be reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well. Jarring effectiveness is
determined by how rapidly you can impact weight into the jars. When jarring without a compounder or accelerator you rely only on pipe stretch to lift the drill collars upwards after the jar releases to create the upwards impact in the jar. This accelerated upward movement will often be reduced by the friction of the working string along the sides of the well bore, reducing the speed of upwards movement of the drill collars which impact into the jar. At shallow depths jar impact is not achieved because of lack of pipe stretch in the working string.

When pipe stretch alone cannot provide enough energy to free a fish, compounders or accelerators are used. Compounders or accelerators are energized when you over pull on the working string and compress a compressible fluid through a few feet of stroke distance and at the same time activate the fishing jar. When the fishing jar releases the stored energy in the compounder/acclerator lifts the drill collars upwards at a high speed creating a high impact in the jar.

==== System dynamics ====

Jars rely on the principle of stretching a pipe to build elastic potential energy such that when the jar trips it relies on the masses of the drill pipe and collars to gain velocity and subsequently strike the anvil section of jar. This impact results in a force, or blow, which is converted into energy.

=== Surface resonant vibrators ===

====History====
The concept of using vibration to free stuck objects from a wellbore originated in the 1940s, and probably stemmed from the 1930s use of vibration to drive piling in the Soviet Union. The early use of vibration for driving and extracting piles was confined to low-frequency operation; that is, frequencies less than the fundamental resonant frequency of the system and consequently, although effective, the process was only an improvement on conventional hammer equipment. Early patents and teaching attempted to explain the process and mechanism involved, but lacked a certain degree of sophistication. In 1961, A. G. Bodine obtained a patent that was to become the &quot;mother patent&quot; for oil field tubular extraction using sonic techniques. Mr. Bodine introduced the concept of resonant vibration that effectively eliminated the reactance portion of mechanical impedance, thus leading to the means of efficient sonic power transmission. Subsequently, Mr. Bodine obtained additional patents directed to more focused applications of the technology.

The first published work on this technique was outlined in a 1987 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) paper presented at the International Association of Drilling Contractors in Dallas, Texas detailing the nature of the work and the operational results that were achieved. The cited work involving liner, tubing, and drill pipe extraction and was very successful. Reference Two presented at the Society of Petroleum Engineers Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in Anaheim, California, November 2007 explains the resonant vibration theory in more detail as well as its use in extracting long lengths of mud stuck tubulars.

==== System dynamics ====

Surface Resonant Vibrators rely on the principle of counter rotating eccentric weights to impart a sinusoidal harmonic motion from the surface into the work string at the surface. Reference Three (above) provides a full explanation of this technology. The frequency of rotation, and hence vibration of the pipe string, is tuned to the resonant frequency of the system. The system is defined as the surface resonant vibrator, pipe string, fish and retaining media. The resultant forces imparted to the fish is based on the following logic:

* The delivery forces from the surface are a result of the static overpull force from the rig, plus the dynamic force component of the rotating eccentric weights
* Depending on the static overpull force component, the resultant force at the fish can be either tension or compression due to the sinusoidal force wave component from the oscillator
* Initially during startup of a vibrator, some force is necessary to lift and lower the entire load mass of the system. When the vibrator tunes to the resonant frequency of the system, the reactive load impedance cancels out to zero by virtue of the inductance reactance (mass of the system) equaling the compliance or stiffness reactance (elasticity of the tubular). The remaining impedance of the system, known as the resistive load impedance, is what is retaining the stuck pipe.
* During resonant vibration, a longitudinal sine wave travels down the pipe to the fish with an attendant pipe mass that is equal to a quarter wavelength of the resonant vibrating frequency.
* A phenomenon known as fluidization of soil grains takes place during resonant vibration whereby the granular material constraining the stuck pipe is transformed into a fluidic state that offers little resistance to movement of bodies through the media. In effect, it takes on the characteristics and properties of a liquid.
* During pipe vibration, Dilation and Contraction of the pipe body, known as Poisson&#x27;s ratio, takes place such that when the stuck pipe is subjected to axial strain due to stretching, its diameter will contract. Similarly, when the length of pipe is compressed, its diameter will expand. Since a length of pipe undergoing vibration experiences alternate tensile and compressive forces as waves along its longitudinal axis (and therefore longitudinal strains), its diameter will expand and contract in unison with the applied tensile and compressive waves. This means that for alternate moments during a vibration cycle the pipe may actually be physically free of its bond.

<doc id="394789" wikidata="Q1756520" url="?curid=394789" title="Live &amp; Loud">
<text>Live &amp; Loud is a live album recorded by the former Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne, released on 28 June 1993. At the time, it was to be Osbourne&#x27;s final album following Osbourne&#x27;s final tour before retiring, aptly titled &quot;No More Tours&quot;. The track &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; featured the original line-up of Black Sabbath, the members of which were invited to join Ozzy as guest stars for the Costa Mesa Reunion shows.

In addition to the standard release in a &#x27;fat-boy&#x27; 2CD case, the album was released as a digipak with a metal &#x27;speaker grille&#x27; cover and included tattoos, as well as the booklet; the official release was preceded by a single CD sampler issued as a promotional item.

A DVD of &quot;Live &amp; Loud&quot; was also issued, one of the first music compilations released in that format. The DVD is a compilation of live footage from several shows rather than a single concert: this is evident as Osbourne can be seen both shirtless and wearing different clothes during the same song, while guitarist Zakk Wylde can be seen playing up to three different guitars in the same song. The live recordings in the CD (with the exclusion of Wylde&#x27;s guitar solo and Castillo&#x27;s drum solo) are used as the soundtrack for the collage of performances in the video release, the only difference being in the selection of speeches with which Osbourne introduces some of the songs.

In 1994, Osbourne won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the live version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Change the World&quot;, featured on this album.

Due to ongoing legal litigation regarding song writing credits for the track &quot;Shot In The Dark&quot;, this album, along with &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; and &quot;Just Say Ozzy (&quot;both of which also included the song), were not remastered and reissued along with the rest of Ozzy&#x27;s back catalog in 2002. However, the Grammy-winning live track, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Change the World&quot; from &quot;Live &amp; Loud&quot; did appear on &quot;The Essential Ozzy Osbourne&quot; compilation released in 2003.

<text>The Ozzman Cometh is a compilation album by British heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne released in 1997. It is his third greatest hits collection. Its initial, limited-edition 2-CD pressing contained five previously unreleased songs. Versions released in 2002 later have only one disc, and the song &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; is replaced by &quot;Miracle Man&quot;. This was due to a legal action brought about by the song&#x27;s co-writer, Phil Soussan, for unpaid royalties.

The CD Version is Digitally Labeled as The Ozzman Cometh: Greatest Hits. The tracks &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot;, &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; are performed by Osbourne&#x27;s previous band Black Sabbath during a 26 April 1970 performance on the BBC Radio 1 show &quot;John Peel&#x27;s Sunday Show&quot;, conducted by British DJ John Peel. &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; and &quot;War Pigs&quot; are early versions of tracks that would be recorded and released on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Paranoid&quot; with new lyrics.

<text>Jackie Brown is a 1997 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, based on the 1992 novel &quot;Rum Punch&quot; by Elmore Leonard. It stars Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, a flight attendant who smuggles money between the United States and Mexico. Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, and Robert De Niro appear in supporting roles.

&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; pays homage to 1970s blaxploitation films, particularly &quot;Coffy&quot; and &quot;Foxy Brown&quot;, both of which also starred Grier. It is the only feature-length film directed by Tarantino that was based on another work.

&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; was released in the United States on December 25, 1997, by Miramax Films. It received positive reviews and grossed $74.7 million worldwide on a $12 million budget. It was both Grier and Forster&#x27;s first lead role in a major film for many years, and earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Forster, and Golden Globe Award nominations for Jackson and Grier.

==Plot==

Jackie Brown, a flight attendant, smuggles money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie, a gun runner in Los Angeles. When Ordell&#x27;s bagman, Beaumont Livingston, is arrested, Ordell hires bail bondsman Max Cherry to bail him out. He then lures Beaumont into the trunk of a car and murders him.

Acting on information Beaumont had already given them, ATF agent Ray Nicolette and LAPD detective Mark Dargus intercept Jackie with Ordell&#x27;s cash and a bag of cocaine. After Jackie is sent to jail, Ordell has Max pay her bail. Ordell arrives at Jackie&#x27;s apartment, but she pulls out a gun she stole from Max&#x27;s glovebox. She negotiates a deal with Ordell: she will pretend to help the authorities while smuggling in the remaining $550,000 of Ordell&#x27;s money.

Ordell replaces Beaumont with Louis Gara, a criminal associate and former cellmate who has just been released from prison. Melanie Ralston, one of Ordell&#x27;s mistresses, asks Louis to betray Ordell and take the money for themselves. Louis tells Ordell, but Ordell replies that he is not concerned about her, given that he knows she’s not to be trusted completely.

Unaware of the plan to smuggle in $550,000, Nicolette and Dargus devise a sting to catch Ordell during a transfer of $50,000. Jackie plans to keep the $500,000 for herself. She recruits Max, offering him a cut. During a test run, Jackie smuggles in $10,000, with Nicolette and Dargus aware, to swap with Sheronda, Ordell&#x27;s live-in girlfriend, at a shopping mall. After Jackie leaves, Max observes an unknown woman swap bags with Sheronda. He informs Jackie and she confronts Ordell, who reveals that he sent Simone Hawkins, another mule, to secure his money as a backup.

On the day of the transfer, Ordell discovers that Simone has left town with the $10,000. He reluctantly recruits Melanie to perform the swap instead. Jackie enters a dressing room in a department store to try on a suit. Though she has told Nicolette the exchange will take place in the food court, she has told Ordell she will swap bags in the dressing room. The bag contains only $40,000; Jackie leaves the rest in the dressing room for Max. Jackie takes $10,000 and places it on top of the bag she gives to Melanie. Jackie runs to the food court and finds Nicolette, claiming Melanie burst into the dressing room and stole the money.

During the exchange, Melanie is uncooperative, and in the parking lot afterwards mocks Louis for forgetting where they parked. He loses his temper and fatally shoots her. Louis then tells Ordell, who discovers that most of the money is missing. When Louis recalls seeing Max at the shopping mall, an enraged Ordell kills Louis.

Ordell instructs Max to tell Jackie that Ordell will kill them if she does not return the money and that if she goes to the police, he will name her as an accessory. Max goes to Ordell&#x27;s house, and tells him that Jackie, frightened, is waiting in Max&#x27;s office with the money. Ordell holds Max at gunpoint as they enter his office. Jackie yells out that Ordell has a gun. Nicolette, Dargus, and Cherry&#x27;s business partner Winston, who provided Max with Ordell&#x27;s location, hiding in the back, ambush him and shoot him dead. The charges against Jackie are dropped, and she plans a trip to Madrid. Max declines an invitation to join her. They kiss goodbye and he watches her drive away.

==Production==
===Development===
After completing &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary acquired the film rights to Elmore Leonard&#x27;s novels &quot;Rum Punch&quot;, &quot;Freaky Deaky&quot;, and &quot;Killshot&quot;. Tarantino initially planned to film either &quot;Freaky Deaky&quot; or &quot;Killshot&quot; and have another director make &quot;Rum Punch&quot;, but changed his mind after re-reading &quot;Rum Punch&quot;, saying he &quot;fell in love&quot; with the novel all over again. &quot;Killshot&quot; was later adapted into a film released in 2008, produced by &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; producer Lawrence Bender.

While adapting &quot;Rum Punch&quot; into a screenplay, Tarantino changed the ethnicity of the main character from white to black, as well as renaming her from Burke to Brown, titling the screenplay &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. Tarantino hesitated to discuss the changes with Leonard, finally speaking with Leonard as the film was about to start shooting. Leonard loved the screenplay, considering it the best of the twenty-six screen adaptations of his novels and short stories, and also stating that it was possibly the best screenplay he had ever read.

Tarantino&#x27;s screenplay otherwise closely followed Leonard&#x27;s novel, incorporating elements of Tarantino&#x27;s trademark humor and pacing. The screenplay was also influenced by blaxploitation films, but Tarantino said &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; is not a blaxploitation film.

&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; alludes to Grier&#x27;s career in many ways. The film&#x27;s poster resembles those of Grier&#x27;s films &quot;Coffy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Foxy Brown&quot; (1974) and includes quotes from both films. The typeface for the film&#x27;s opening titles was also used for those of &quot;Foxy Brown&quot;; some of the background music is taken from these films, including four songs from Roy Ayers&#x27;s original score for &quot;Coffy&quot;.

The film&#x27;s opening sequence recreates that of &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), in which Dustin Hoffman passes wearily through Los Angeles International Airport past white tiles to a somber &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel. In &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, Grier walks to a soaring soul music song, &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; by Bobby Womack, which is from the film of the same name that was a part of the blaxploitation genre, just like &quot;Foxy Brown&quot; and &quot;Coffy&quot;.

===Casting===
Tarantino wanted Pam Grier to play the title character. She previously read for the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; character Jody, but Tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for Eric Stoltz to yell at her. Grier did not expect Tarantino to contact her after the success of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. When she showed up to read for &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, Tarantino had posters of her films in his office. She asked if he had put them up because she was coming to read for his film, and he responded that he was actually planning to take them down before her audition, to avoid making it look like he wanted to impress her.

Several years after the release of the movie, Sylvester Stallone claimed that he turned down the role of Louis Gara. Tarantino considered Paul Newman, Gene Hackman and John Saxon for the role of Max Cherry, before casting Robert Forster.

====&quot;Out of Sight&quot;====
While &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; was in production, Universal Pictures was preparing to begin production on director Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, an adaptation of Leonard&#x27;s 1996 novel of the same name that also features the character of Ray Nicolette, and waited to see whom Tarantino would cast as Nicolette for &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. Michael Keaton was hesitant to take the part of Ray Nicolette, even though Tarantino wanted him for it. Keaton subsequently agreed to play Nicolette again in &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, uncredited, appearing in one brief scene. Although the legal rights to the character were held by Tarantino and Miramax Films, as &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; had been produced first, Tarantino insisted that Miramax Films not charge Universal for using the character in &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, allowing the character&#x27;s appearance without Miramax Films receiving financial compensation.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives it an approval rating of 88% based on 96 reviews and an average rating of 7.60/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Although somewhat lackadaisical in pace, &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; proves to be an effective star vehicle for Pam Grier while offering the usual Tarantino wit and charm.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a 64 out of 100 based on 23 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert rated the film four out of four stars, writing that &quot;Tarantino leaves the hardest questions for last, hides his moves, conceals his strategies in plain view, and gives his characters dialogue that is alive, authentic and spontaneous.&quot; He also ranked the film as one of his favorites of 1997. Movie critic Mark Kermode for BBC Radio Five Live lists &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; as his favorite film by Quentin Tarantino. Samuel L. Jackson, who appears frequently in Tarantino&#x27;s films, named his character of Ordell Robbie as one of his favorite roles.

===Box office===
The film grossed $39.7million in the United States and Canada and $35.1million in other territories for a total gross of $74.7million, against a budget of $12million. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $9.3million, finishing 5th at the box office.

===Controversy===
&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; has attracted criticism for its use of the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot;, which is used 38 times, the most in any Tarantino film until &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015). During an interview with Manohla Dargis, Tarantino said: &quot;The minute any word has that much power, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, everyone on the planet should scream it. No word deserves that much power.&quot; The filmmaker Spike Lee criticized the film&#x27;s use of the word, and said: &quot;I&#x27;m not against the word, and I use it, but not excessively. And some people speak that way. But, Quentin is infatuated with that word. What does he want to be madean honorary black man? And he uses it in all his pictures: &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;... I want Quentin to know that all African-Americans do not think that word is trendy or slick.&quot; Lee took his concerns to the film&#x27;s producers, Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender.

The film critic Pascoe Soyurz said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily align myself with Spike Lee, but I do have some reservations about a film of this kind coming out at this time. It seems to me there&#x27;s a kind of culture-vulture feel to it. I&#x27;m concerned about the whole &#x27;blaxploitation&#x27; thing. Hollywood is a dream factory but it was Hollywood that created some of the most negative images of black people, which had major effects on the way we were perceived around the world.&quot; He concludes by stating that Tarantino&#x27;s use of the word &quot;devalues the word and the word has a lot of significance.&quot;

===Awards===
Grier and Jackson were nominated for Golden Globe Awards (Grier for Best ActressMotion Picture Musical or Comedy and Jackson for Best ActorMotion Picture Musical or Comedy). Forster was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. In 2008, the film was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, ranking in at .

At the 48th Berlin International Film Festival, Jackson won the Silver Bear for Best Actor award.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album for &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, entitled &quot;Jackie Brown: Music from the Miramax Motion Picture&quot;, was released on December 9, 1997.

Songs by a variety of artists are heard throughout the film, including The Delfonics&#x27; &quot;La-La Means I Love You&quot; and &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot;, Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Who Is He&quot;, The Grass Roots&#x27; &quot;Midnight Confessions&quot;, Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Tennessee Stud&quot;, Bloodstone&#x27;s &quot;Natural High&quot;, and Foxy Brown&#x27;s &quot;(Holy Matrimony) Married to the Firm&quot;. There are several songs included that were featured in blaxploitation films as well, including Bobby Womack&#x27;s &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;, from the film of the same name, and Pam Grier&#x27;s &quot;Long Time Woman&quot;, from her 1971 film &quot;The Big Doll House&quot;. The original soundtrack also features separate tracks with dialogue from the film. Instead of using a new film score, Tarantino incorporated Roy Ayers&#x27; funk score from the film &quot;Coffy&quot;.

A number of songs used in the film do not appear on the soundtrack, such as &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; (The Meters), and &quot;Piano Impromptu&quot; (Dick Walter).

==Home media==
The Special Edition DVD, released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 2002, includes an introduction from Tarantino, an hour-long retrospective interview, a subtitle trivia track, and soundtrack chapter selection, a half-hour making-of documentary (&quot;&quot;How It Went Down&quot;), the entire &quot;Chicks Who Love Guns&quot;&quot; video as seen in the film, many deleted and alternate scenes, including an alternate opening title sequence, Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s review, &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; appearances on MTV, TV spots and theatrical trailers, written reviews, and articles and filmographies, and over an hour of trailers for Pam Grier and Robert Forster films dating from the 1960s onwards. The box also includes a mini-poster of the film, similar to the one above, and on the back of that, two other mini-postersone of Grier, the other of Forster, both similar to the album cover.

Although the Special Edition DVD&#x27;s back cover states that the film is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it was actually shot with a 1.85:1 ratio, the only Tarantino-directed film to date shot in such a format with the exception of his segment in the film &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot;.

On October 4, 2011, Miramax released &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; on Blu-ray Disc along with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The film is presented in 1080p HD in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. The disc was the result of a new licensing deal with Miramax and Lionsgate.

Following Paramount Global&#x27;s 49% stake in Miramax, the film was reissued on Blu-ray and DVD by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment on September 22, 2020. In 2023, Lionsgate announced that they had purchased the distribution rights to &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, along with both &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films; all three films were released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 10, 2023. The 4K remaster of Jackie Brown was released on Blu-ray and digitally on January 21, 2025.

<doc id="394795" wikidata="Q6896568" url="?curid=394795" title="Molly Elliot Seawell">
<text>Molly Elliot Seawell (October 23, 1860 – November 15, 1916), an early American historian and writer, was a descendant of the Seawells of Virginia and a niece of President John Tyler. Raised on a large plantation, her education included being &quot;turned loose in a library of good books&quot;, her father&#x27;s home containing the best literature of the 18th century. She read English classics, and was especially fond of poetry. She did not read a novel until after she was 17, and the first was Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. Her three amusements were reading, riding and piano-playing. Her father, a prominent lawyer, died just as Seawell reached adulthood.

Seawell sent some stories to &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; when William S. Walsh was the editor. Recognizing Seawell&#x27;s ability to be unusual, he encouraged her from the beginning. Her first stories were signed with a pen name till her friends persuaded her to sign her own name, which occurred after &quot;Maid Marian&quot; was published. This is considered her best story. She ventured into the genre of juvenile literature when she sent &quot;Little Jarvis&quot; to &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; to contend for the prize.

It is possible that Seawell&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Absence of Creative Faculty in Women&quot; attracted more attention than any of her books. Women answered it, and the discussion was joined by Andrew Lang, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and others. &quot;The Critic&quot; stated that essay attracted more attention than any single article ever published in its columns. In style, Seawell was said to resemble Jane Austen. Seawell&#x27;s works, besides numerous short stories, included: &quot;Young Heros of our Navy&quot;, &quot;Maid Marian and Other Stories&quot;, &quot;Midshipman Paulding&quot;, &quot;Hale Weston&quot;, &quot;Paul Jones&quot;, and &quot;The Midshipmen&#x27;s Mess&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Molly Elliot Seawell was born in Gloucester, Virginia, a member of one of the older European families to settle in Virginia. Her father, John Tyler Seawell, a lawyer and orator, was a nephew of President John Tyler. Her mother (Tyler&#x27;s second wife), Frances Elizabeth Jackson Seawell, was a native of Baltimore whose father, Major William Jackson, a distinguished officer in the War of 1812, who was with the Cavalry division at the Battle of North Point, 12 September 1814.

Descendants of the original Seawells spell the family name in one of two forms: &quot;Sewell&quot; (as in Sewell&#x27;s Point, Norfolk, Virginia) and &quot;Seawell.&quot; Otis Notman interviewing Molly Elliot Seawell for &quot;The New York Times Saturday Review of Books&quot; noted that the regional pronunciation of the name was &quot;Sowell,&quot; although Molly Elliot Seawell pronounced her name as it was spelled (&quot;Talks&quot;, 392).

Seawell spent her early life at the family&#x27;s plantation home, &quot;The Shelter,&quot; which had been a hospital in the American Revolutionary War. She described her early formation as a &quot;... secluded life ... in the library of an old Virginia country house, and in a community where conditions more nearly resembled the eighteenth than the nineteenth century&quot; (&quot;The Ladies&#x27; Battle&quot;, 116).

Her father was a student of the Classics, who influenced her learning. She was not allowed to read a novel until she was 17, instead reading history, encyclopedias, and the works of William Shakespeare and the Romantic poets. Her education was primarily informal at home, where she learned riding, dancing, and household management. In addition to these influences and her Tidewater surroundings, Seawell&#x27;s seafaring uncle, Joseph Seawell, contributed to her future literary subjects.

==Life==

After her father&#x27;s death and between her move to Norfolk and settling for life in Washington, D.C., Seawell made the first of many trips to Europe. Her visits took her to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, France, Germany, and even as far as Imperial Russia. Apparently the appeal of Russia and Germany was the therapeutic waters of the baths, to which Seawell attributed the improvement of a chronic eye condition (Notman &quot;Some Authors,&quot; &quot;Talks&quot;). Her summers in Europe, returning to Washington in October, became a regular event. These travels extended the material of her literary subjects which included the sea, England, France, and Central Europe.

The household Seawell sustained with her mother and her younger sister Henrietta on P Street near Washington&#x27;s fashionable Du Pont Circle was the location of an artists&#x27; salon of sorts. She entertained artists and writers there in addition to such notables of the time as the Earl of Carlisle and his daughter, Lady Dorothy Howard (Notman &quot;Some Authors,&quot; &quot;Talks&quot;). After the death of her mother and later of Henrietta, Seawell temporarily withdrew from social life, despite an enormous capacity for friendship and interest in people.

Seawell&#x27;s health had been precarious for a number of years. She died of cancer in her home on November 15, 1916, only a few weeks after her 56th birthday. Her Roman Catholic Requiem Mass was held at the Church of St. Matthew (now the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle). Her body was interred in Baltimore&#x27;s Greenmount Cemetery.

==Writings==
The death of her father when she was 20 (Notman &quot;Talks&quot; 392) prompted Molly Elliot Seawell, her mother and her younger sister, Henrietta, to move from &quot;The Shelter&quot; in Gloucester to Norfolk and later to Washington, D.C. It was either in Norfolk or in Washington that Seawell began her literary career in earnest.

She first wrote using pseudonyms (including the patrician-sounding &quot;Foxcroft Davis&quot; – the novels &quot;Mrs. Darrell&quot; and &quot;The Whirl&quot; – and the Russian &quot;Vera Sapoukhyn&quot;) until the publication of her short story &quot;Maid Marian&quot; in 1886, a tale she later dramatized for actress Rosina Vokes. Her first novel, &quot;Hale-Weston&quot;, published in 1889, was widely read and translated into German. These successes established her literary career; in her own words:

In 1890, Seawell received a prize for a short story. Five years later, she received a $3000 prize from the New York &quot;Herald&quot; for a story.

Her literary production included forty books of fiction, collected short fiction, non-fiction, and numerous political columns from Washington for New York dailies and essays. Among her political essays was a 1910 article for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; opposing women&#x27;s suffrage, in which she also spoke ill of the extension of the franchise to African Americans after the Civil War.

For her short stories and historical works, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by American professor Charles W. Kent in 1910 and 1911

==Style==

Seawell&#x27;s fiction might be distinguished into three genres: regional fiction, romances, and books for boys (primarily nautical stories). Their strong suit is Seawell&#x27;s ability in characterization rather than her plots. In an interview with her, Notman observed this strength (&quot;Talks&quot; 392), to which she replied: &quot;My people usually seem flesh and blood to me. If they do not have the breath of life in them at the beginning, no amount of labor can make them real.&quot; Mitchell in American Women Writers remarks more critically, &quot;Plot was never her strong point, and the perfect ladies and gentlemen, the overt racism, and the condescending tone are interesting only because they reflect values once widespread&quot; (41).

Seawell was widely read in her time and, at the beginning of the 20th century, was included in standard reference works on American writers and among the &quot;Times&#x27;s&quot; Otis Notman&#x27;s interviews with William Dean Howells, Jack London, and Theodore Dreiser.

<text>Andreas Libavius or Andrew Libavius was born in Halle, Germany and died in July 1616. Libavius was a renaissance man who spent time as a professor at the University of Jena teaching history and poetry. After which he became a physician at the Gymnasium in Rothenburg and later founded the Gymnasium at Coburg. Libavius was most known for practicing alchemy and writing a book called &quot;Alchemia&quot;, one of the first chemistry textbooks ever written.

==Life==
Libavius was born in Halle, Germany, as Andreas Libau, the son of Johann Libau. His father, only a linen worker, could not give Libavius an education because in this time period only the wealthy were able to get a higher education. Showing great intelligence as a child Livavius overcame his personal status and attended the University of Whittenburg at the age of eighteen in 1578. In 1579 he entered the University of Jena where he studied philosophy, history and medicine. In 1581 he obtained the academic degree of &quot;magister artium&quot; and was named a poet laureate.

He began teaching in Ilmenau in 1581 and remained there until 1586 when he moved to Coburg to teach there. In 1588 he went to study at the University of Basel and received the degree of &quot;medicinae doctor&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he became a professor of history and poetry at the University of Jena. At the same time, he also supervised the disputations in the field of medicine.

In 1591 he became physician of the city council of Rothenburg and, one year later, became the superintendent of schools. This position led to conflict with the rector of schools causing Libavius to move to Coburg in 1605. In 1606 he was offered and accepted the position of headmaster of the reestablished Casimirianum Gymnasium in Coburg. He lived in Coburg from 1607 until his death in 1616.

Little is known about his personal life, but he did have two sons, Michael, and Andreas, who followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a teacher and physician. He also had two daughters, Susanna, and one whose name is not known.

== Alchemy ==
Libavius is best known for his work as an alchemist above all else. Alchemy was an early science whose goals were to transform matter like turning base metals to gold. Alchemists also tried to find an elixir of life that would allow them to cure all disease. Alchemy is the study that turned into what we know today as chemistry. Libavius believed that his studies in alchemy would help further advancements in the medical field.

In 1597 Libavius published &quot;Alchemia&quot;, a textbook that summarized all the discoveries alchemists had made at this point. &quot;Alchemia&quot; was organized into four parts: what to have in a laboratory, descriptions of procedures, chemical analysis, and transmutation. Publishing such a book was blasphemous, as many alchemists wanted to keep their findings to themselves to prevent their findings from being misused. Libavius thought that knowledge should be shared if it could be used to help better mankind.

His studies in alchemy led to many new discoveries in chemistry. He discovered methods to prepare a number of chemicals like hydrochloric acid, ammonium sulfate and tin chloride. He also recorded the dangers of alchemy, as most of it was done in homes, and proposed the development of a series of laboratories, called chemical houses, to make alchemy a safer practice.

==Views on alchemy ==
Libavius was a staunch believer in chrysopoeia, or the ability to transmute a base metal into gold. This viewpoint was a matter of much debate for alchemists of the time, and he defended it in several of his writings. Though he did discover several new chemical processes, he tended to be more of a theoretician, and he leaned toward traditional Aristotelianism rather than Paracelsian alchemy.

He was an opponent of Paracelsus on the grounds of Paracelsus&#x27; disrespect for ancient thought, magnification of personal experience above others&#x27; experience, overstatement of the didactic function of nature, use of magical words and symbols in natural philosophy, confusion of natural and supernatural causes, interjection of seeds into the creation of the universe, and postulation of astral influences. Despite this, he did not entirely reject all Paracelsian methods.
In &quot;The Rosicrucian Enlightenment,&quot; Frances Yates states:

Andrea Libavius was one of those &quot;chymists&quot; who was influenced up to a point by the new teachings of Paracelsus in that he accepted the use of the new chemical remedies in medicine advocated by Paracelsus, whilst adhering theoretically to the traditional Aristotelian and Galenist teachings and rejecting Paracelsist mysticism. Aristotle and Galen appear, honourably placed, on the title-page of Libavius&#x27;s main work, the &quot;Alchymia&quot;, published at Frankfurt in 1596 ... Libavius criticized the Rosicrucian &quot;Fama&quot; and &quot;Confessio&quot; in several works. Basing himself on the texts of the two manifestos, Libavius raises serious objections to them on scientific, political, and religious grounds. Libavius is strongly against theories of macro-microcosmic harmony, against &quot;Magia and Cabala&quot;, against Hermes Trismegistus (from whose supposed writings he makes many quotations), against Agrippa and Trithemius—in short he is against the Renaissance tradition.

He accepted the Paracelsian principle of using occult properties to explain phenomena with no apparent cause but rejected the conclusion that a thing possessing these properties must have an astral connection to the divine.

He was also critical of alchemists who claimed to have produced a panacea, or cure-all, not because he didn&#x27;t believe that a panacea was possible, but because these alchemists invariably refused to disclose their formulas. He believed that anyone who managed to create a panacea was duty bound to teach the process to as many other people as possible, so that it could benefit mankind. He was particularly critical of Georgius am Wald (also called Georgius an und von Wald), an alchemist who wrote a book in which he claimed to have made a panacea. Libavius considered am Wald to be a fraud and declared that am Wald&#x27;s panacea was no more than sulfur and mercury, not gold as am Wald claimed. Between 1595 and 1596 he dedicated four volumes, &quot;Neoparacelsica&quot;, &quot;Tractatus duo physici&quot;, &quot;Gegenbericht von der Panacea Amwaldina&quot;, and &quot;Panacea Amwaldina victa&quot; to exposing am Wald as a quack.

==Works==
Within a span of 25 years (1591–1616) Libavius wrote more than 40 works in the field of logic, theology, physics, medicine, chemistry, pharmacy and poetry. He was actively involved in polemics, especially in the fields of chemistry and alchemy, and as such many of his writings were controversial at the time.

Libavius was an orthodox Lutheran, and in his theological treatises, which he wrote under the pseudonym of Basilius de Varna, he criticized Catholicism, specifically the Jesuit order, and later on in his life, Calvinism. This can also be seen in some of his non-theological works, particularly in some of the works produced during his involvement with the conflict between the Paracelsists, anti-Paracelsists, Galenists, and Hermetics.

In 1597, he wrote the first systematic chemistry textbook, &quot;Alchymia&quot;, where he described the possibility of transmutation. In this book he also showed that cuprous salt lotions are detectable with ammonia, which causes them to change color to dark blue. In 1615 he wrote &quot;Syntagmatis alchamiae arcanorum&quot; where he detailed the production of tin chloride, something that he developed in 1605. He was not the first person to invent this process, however, as the Franciscan friar Ulmannus had discovered it earlier and wrote about in the book &quot;Buch der heiligen Dreifaltigkeit&quot; in 1415.

He also contributed works to the study of medicine. Between 1599 and 1601 he wrote &quot;Singularia&quot;, a four volume collection of lectures on natural science, which included a collection of descriptions and discussions about medical phenomena. In 1610 he published one of the first German medical texts, &quot;Tractatus Medicus Physicus und Historia des fürtrefflichen Casimirianischen SawerBrunnen/ unter Libenstein/ nicht fern von Schmalkalden gelegen&quot;.

<doc id="394815" wikidata="Q1065449" url="?curid=394815" title="Introduced species">
<text>An introduced species, alien species, exotic species, adventive species, immigrant species, foreign species, non-indigenous species, or non-native species is a species living outside its native distributional range, but which has arrived there by human activity, directly or indirectly, and either deliberately or accidentally. Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem. Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are considered naturalized. The process of human-caused introduction is distinguished from biological colonization, in which species spread to new areas through &quot;natural&quot; (non-human) means such as storms and rafting. The Latin expression neobiota captures the characteristic that these species are &quot;new&quot; biota to their environment in terms of established biological network (e.g. food web) relationships. Neobiota can further be divided into neozoa (also: neozoons, sing. neozoon, i.e. animals) and [[Neophyte (botany)|neophyta]] (plants).

The impact of introduced species is highly variable. Some have a substantial negative effect on a local ecosystem (in which case they are also classified more specifically as an invasive species), while other introduced species may have little or no negative impact (no invasiveness), and integrate well into the ecosystem they have been introduced to. Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests. They are called biocontrols and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example. In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown. The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists, governments, farmers and others.

== Terminology ==
The formal definition of an introduced species from the United States Environmental Protection Agency is &quot;A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area. Also called an exotic or non-native species&quot;.

In the broadest and most widely used sense, an introduced species is synonymous with &quot;non-native&quot; and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the basic definition given above. However, some sources add to that basic definition &quot;and are now reproducing in the wild&quot;, which means that species growing in a garden, farm, or house may not meet the criteria unless they escape and persist.

===Subset descriptions===

There are many terms associated with introduced species that represent subsets of introduced species, and the terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons. Examples of these terms are &quot;invasive&quot;, &quot;acclimatized&quot;, &quot;adventive&quot;, &quot;naturalized&quot;, and &quot;immigrant&quot; species.

The term &quot;invasive&quot; is used to describe introduced species that cause ecological, economic, or other damage to the area in which they were introduced.

Acclimatized species are introduced species that have changed physically and/or behaviorally in order to adjust to their new environment. Acclimatized species are not necessarily optimally adjusted to their new environment and may just be physically/behaviorally sufficient for the new environment.

Adventive species are often considered synonymous with &quot;introduced species&quot;, but this term is sometimes applied exclusively to introduced species that are not permanently established.

Naturalized species are often introduced species that do not need human help to reproduce and maintain their population in an area outside their native range (no longer adventive), but that also applies to populations migrating and establishing in a novel environment (e.g.: in Europe, house sparrows are well established since early Iron Age though they originated from Asia).

Immigrant species are species that travel, sometimes by themselves, but often with human help, between two habitats. Invasiveness is not a requirement.

=== Invasive species ===
Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an &quot;introduced species&quot;. Such species might be termed naturalized, &quot;established&quot;, or &quot;wild non-native species&quot;. If they further spread beyond the place of introduction and cause damage to nearby species, they are called &quot;invasive species&quot;. The transition from introduction, to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants. Introduced species are essentially &quot;non-native&quot; species. Invasive species are those introduced species that spread widely or quickly and cause harm, be that to the environment, human health, other valued resources, or the economy. There have been calls from scientists to consider a species &quot;invasive&quot; only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause.

According to a practical definition, an invasive species is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location, spreading (invading) by natural means. The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm. For example, U.S. Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines &quot;invasive species&quot; as &quot;an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health&quot;. The biological definition of invasive species, on the other hand, makes no reference to the harm they may cause, only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction.

Some argue that &quot;invasive&quot; is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define.

From a regulatory perspective, it is neither desirable nor practical to list as undesirable or outright ban all non-native species (although the State of Hawaii has adopted an approach that comes close to this). Regulations require a definitional distinction between non-natives that are deemed especially onerous and all others. Introduced &quot;pest&quot; species, that are officially listed as invasive, best fit the definition of an invasive species. Early detection and rapid response is the most effective strategy for regulating a pest species and reducing economic and environmental impacts of an introduction. Management of invasion pathways are on the forefront of eliminating unwanted invasive species this would include preliminary steps; educating the public, cooperation from industries and government resources.

In Great Britain, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prevents the introduction of any animal not naturally occurring in the wild or any of a list of both animals or plants introduced previously and proved to be invasive.

== Nature of introductions ==

By definition, a species is considered &quot;introduced&quot; when its transport into an area outside of its native range is human mediated. Introductions by humans can be described as either intentional or accidental. Intentional introductions have been motivated by individuals or groups who either (1) believe that the newly introduced species will be in some way beneficial to humans in its new location or, (2) species are introduced intentionally but with no regard to the potential impact. Unintentional or accidental introductions are most often a byproduct of human movements and are thus unbound to human motivations. Subsequent range expansion of introduced species may or may not involve human activity.

=== Intentional introductions ===
Species that humans intentionally transport to new regions can subsequently become successfully established in two ways. In the first case, organisms are purposely released for establishment in the wild. It is sometimes difficult to predict whether a species will become established upon release, and if not initially successful, humans have made repeated introductions to improve the probability that the species will survive and eventually reproduce in the wild. In these cases, it is clear that the introduction is directly facilitated by human desires.

In the second case, species intentionally transported into a new region may escape from captive or cultivated populations and subsequently establish independent breeding populations. Escaped organisms are included in this category because their initial transport to a new region is human motivated.

The widespread phenomena of intentional introduction has also been described as biological globalization.

Positive Introductions 

Although most introduced species have negative impacts on the ecosystems they enter into, there are still some species that have affected the ecosystem in a positive way. For example, in New Hampshire invasive plants can provide some benefits to some species. Invasive species such as autumn olive, oriental bittersweet, and honeysuckle produce fruit that is used by a handful of fruit-eating bird species. The invasive plants can also be a source of pollen and nectar for many insects, such as bees. These invasive plants were able to help their ecosystem thriving, and increase the native animal&#x27;s chances of survival. Several introduced exotic trees served as nest sites for resident waterbird species in Udaipur city, India.

==== Motivations for intentional introductions ====

===== Economic =====

Perhaps the most common motivation for introducing a species into a new place is that of economic gain. Non-native species can become such a common part of an environment, culture, and even diet that little thought is given to their geographic origin. For example, soybeans, kiwi fruit, wheat, honey bees, and all livestock except the American bison and the turkey are non-native species to North America. Collectively, non-native crops and livestock account for 98% of US food. These and other benefits from non-natives are so vast that, according to the Congressional Research Service, they probably exceed the costs.

Other examples of species introduced for the purposes of benefiting agriculture, aquaculture or other economic activities are widespread. Eurasian carp was first introduced to the United States as a potential food source. The apple snail was released in Southeast Asia with the intent that it be used as a protein source, and subsequently to places like Hawaii to establish a food industry. In Alaska, foxes were introduced to many islands to create new populations for the fur trade. About twenty species of African and European dung beetles have established themselves in Australia after deliberate introduction by the Australian Dung Beetle Project in an effort to reduce the impact of livestock manure. The timber industry promoted the introduction of Monterey pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;) from California to Australia and New Zealand as a commercial timber crop. These examples represent only a small subsample of species that have been moved by humans for economic interests.

The rise in the use of genetically modified organisms has added another potential economic advantage to introducing new/modified species into different environments. Companies such as Monsanto that earn much of their profit through the selling of genetically modified seeds has added to the controversy surrounding introduced species. The effect of genetically modified organisms varies from organism to organism and is still being researched today, however, the rise of genetically modified organisms has added complexity to the conversations surrounding introduced species.

===== Human enjoyment =====
Introductions have also been important in supporting recreation activities or otherwise increasing human enjoyment. Numerous fish and game animals have been introduced for the purposes of sport fishing and hunting. The introduced amphibian (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;) that threatens the endemic California salamander (&quot;A. californiense&quot;) was introduced to California as a source of bait for fishermen. Pet animals have also been frequently transported into new areas by humans, and their escapes have resulted in several introductions, such as feral cats, parrots, and pond slider.

&quot;Lophura nycthemera&quot; (silver pheasant), a native of East Asia, has been introduced into parts of Europe for ornamental reasons.

Many plants have been introduced with the intent of aesthetically improving public recreation areas or private properties. The introduced Norway maple for example occupies a prominent status in many of Canada&#x27;s parks. The transport of ornamental plants for landscaping use has and continues to be a source of many introductions. Some of these species have escaped horticultural control and become invasive. Notable examples include water hyacinth, salt cedar, and purple loosestrife.

In other cases, species have been translocated for reasons of &quot;cultural nostalgia&quot;, which refers to instances in which humans who have migrated to new regions have intentionally brought with them familiar organisms. Famous examples include the introduction of common starlings to North America by the American Eugene Schieffelin, a lover of the works of Shakespeare and the chairman of the American Acclimatization Society, who, it is rumoured, wanted to introduce all of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays into the United States. He deliberately released eighty starlings into Central Park in New York City in 1890, and another forty in 1891.

Yet another prominent example of an introduced species that became invasive is the European rabbit in Australia. Thomas Austin, a British landowner, had rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them. A more recent example is the introduction of the common wall lizard (&quot;Podarcis muralis)&quot; to North America by a Cincinnati boy, George Rau, around 1950 after a family vacation to Italy.

===== Addressing environmental problems =====
Intentional introductions have also been undertaken with the aim of ameliorating environmental problems. A number of fast spreading plants such as kudzu have been introduced as a means of erosion control. Other species have been introduced as biological control agents to control invasive species. This involves the purposeful introduction of a natural enemy of the target species with the intention of reducing its numbers or controlling its spread.

A special case of introduction is the reintroduction of a species that has become locally endangered or extinct, done in the interests of conservation. Examples of successful reintroductions include wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the U.S., and the red kite to parts of England and Scotland. Introductions or translocations of species have also been proposed in the interest of genetic conservation, which advocates the introduction of new individuals into genetically depauperate populations of endangered or threatened species.

=== Unintentional introductions ===

Unintentional introductions occur when species are transported by human vectors. Increasing rates of human travel are providing accelerating opportunities for species to be accidentally transported into areas in which they are not considered native. For example, three species of rat (the black, Norway and Polynesian) have spread to most of the world as hitchhikers on ships, and arachnids such as scorpions and exotic spiders are sometimes transported to areas far beyond their native range by riding in shipments of tropical fruit. This was seen during the introduction of &quot;Steatoda nobilis&quot; (Noble false widow) worldwide through banana shipments. 

Further there are numerous examples of marine organisms being transported in ballast water, among them the invasive comb jelly &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot;, the dangerous bacterium &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, or the fouling zebra mussel. The Mediterranean and Black Seas, with their high volume shipping from exotic sources, are most impacted by this problem. Busy harbors are all potential hotspots as well: over 200 species have been introduced to the San Francisco Bay in this manner making it the most heavily invaded estuary in the world. 

There is also the accidental release of the Africanized honey bees (AHB), known colloquially as &quot;killer bees&quot;) or Africanized bee to Brazil in 1957 and the Asian carp to the United States. The insect commonly known as the brown marmorated stink bug (&quot;Halyomorpha halys&quot;) was introduced accidentally in Pennsylvania. Another form of unintentional introductions is when an intentionally introduced plant carries a parasite or herbivore with it. Some become invasive, for example, the oleander aphid, accidentally introduced with the ornamental plant, oleander.

Yet another unintentional pathway of introduction is during the delivery of humanitarian aid in the aftermath of natural disasters. This occurred during relief efforts for Hurricane Maria in Dominica, it was found that the common green iguana, the Cuban tree frog, and potentially the Venezuela snouted tree frog were introduced with the former two becoming established.

Most accidentally or intentionally introduced species do not become invasive as the ones mentioned above. For instance, Some 179 coccinellid species have been introduced to the U.S. and Canada; about 27 of these non-native species have become established, and only a handful can be considered invasive, including the intentionally introduced &quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot;, multicolored Asian lady beetle. However the small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can produce profound ecological changes. In North America, &quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot; has become the most abundant lady beetle and probably accounts for more observations than all the native lady beetles put together.

== Introduced plants ==
Many non-native plants have been introduced into new territories, initially as either ornamental plants or for erosion control, stock feed, or forestry. Whether an exotic will become an invasive species is seldom understood in the beginning.

A very troublesome marine species in southern Europe is the seaweed &quot;Caulerpa taxifolia&quot;. &quot;Caulerpa&quot; was first observed in the Mediterranean Sea in 1984, off the coast of Monaco. By 1997, it had covered some 50 km2. It has a strong potential to overgrow natural biotopes, and represents a major risk for sublittoral ecosystems. The origin of the alga in the Mediterranean was thought to be either as a migration through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea, or as an accidental introduction from an aquarium.

This species has become invasive in Australia, where it threatens native rare plants and causes erosion and soil slumping around river banks. It has also become invasive in France where it has been listed as an invasive plant species of concern in the Mediterranean region, where it can form monocultures that threaten critical conservation habitats.

== Introduced animals ==

Most introduced species do not become invasive. Examples of introduced animals that have become invasive include the gypsy moth in eastern North America, the zebra mussel and alewife in the Great Lakes, the Canada goose and gray squirrel in Europe, the beaver in Tierra del Fuego, the muskrat in Europe and Asia, the cane toad and red fox in Australia, nutria in North America, Eurasia, and Africa, and the common brushtail possum in New Zealand. In Taiwan, the success of introduced bird species was related to their native range size and body size; larger species with larger native range sizes were found to have larger introduced range sizes.

One notoriously devastating introduced species is the small Indian mongoose (&quot;Urva auropunctata&quot;). Originating in a region encompassing Iran and India, it was introduced to the West Indies and Hawaii in the late 1800s for pest control. Since then, it has thrived on prey unequipped to deal with its speed, nearly leading to the local extinction of a variety of species.

In some cases, introduced animals may unintentionally promote the cause of rewilding. For example, escaped horses and donkeys that have gone feral in the Americas may play ecological roles similar to those of the equids that became extinct there at the end of the Pleistocene.

The exotic pet trade has also been a large source of introduced species. The species favored as pets have more general habitat requirements and larger distributions. Therefore, as these pets escape or are released, unintentionally or intentionally, they are more likely to survive and establish non-native populations in the wild. Among the popular exotic pets that have become alien or invasive species are parrots, frogs, terrapins, and iguanas.

=== Most commonly introduced species ===

Some species, such as the Western honey bee, brown rat, house sparrow, ring-necked pheasant, and European starling, have been introduced very widely. In addition there are some agricultural and pet species that frequently become feral; these include rabbits, dogs, ducks, snakes, goats, fish, pigs, and cats. Many water fleas such as &quot;Daphnia&quot;, &quot;Bosmina&quot; and &quot;Bythotrephes&quot; have introduced around the world, causing dramatic changes in native freshwater ecosystems.

== Genetics ==
When a new species is introduced, the species could potentially breed with members of native species, producing hybrids. The effect of the creating of hybrids can range from having little effect, a negative effect, to having devastating effects on native species. Potential negative effects include hybrids that are less fit for their environment resulting in a population decrease. This was seen in the Atlantic Salmon population when high levels of escape from Atlantic Salmon farms into the wild populations resulted in hybrids that had reduced survival. Potential positive effects include adding to the genetic diversity of the population which can increase the adaptation ability of the population and increase the number of healthy individuals within a population. This was seen in the introduction of guppies in Trinidad to encourage population growth and introduce new alleles into the population. The results of this introduction included increased levels of heterozygosity and a larger population size. Wide-spread introductions of non-native iguanas are causing devastating effects on native &quot;Iguana&quot; populations in the Caribbean Lesser Antilles, as hybrids appear to have higher fitness than native iguanas, leading to competitive outcompetition and replacement. Numerous populations have already become extinct and hybridization continues to reduce the number of native iguanas on multiple islands.

In plants, introduced species have been observed to undergo rapid evolutionary change to adapt to their new environments, with changes in plant height, size, leaf shape, dispersal ability, reproductive output, vegetative reproduction ability, level of dependence on the mycorrhizal network, and level of phenotype plasticity appearing on timescales of decades to centuries.

== On a planetary body ==
It has been hypothesized that invasive species of microbial life could contaminate a planetary body after the former is introduced by a space probe or spacecraft, either deliberately or unintentionally. It has also been hypothesized that the origin of life on earth is due to introductions of life from other planets billions of years ago, possibly by a sentient race. Projects have been proposed to introduce life to other lifeless but habitable planets in other star systems some time in the future. In preparation for this, projects have been proposed to see if anything is still alive from any of the feces left behind during the six Moon landings from 1969 to 1972.

<text>George Preston Marshall (October 11, 1896 – August 9, 1969) was an American professional football executive who founded the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s Washington Redskins. He founded the team as the Boston Braves in 1932. The following season, he relocated the club from Braves Field to Fenway Park and renamed them as the Redskins. Prior to the start of the 1937 NFL season, Marshall relocated the team to Washington, D.C.

Marshall was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame with its inaugural class of 1963. He was a supporter of racial segregation and was the last NFL owner to integrate African Americans onto a roster, only doing so in 1962 amid pressure from the federal government who threatened to block the use of D.C. Stadium. Marshall owned the team and was its president until his death from health issues in 1969. 

==Early life and college==
Marshall was born in Grafton, West Virginia, where his parents, Thomas Hildebrand (&quot;Hill&quot;) Marshall and Blanche Preston Marshall, owned the local newspaper. When he was a teenager, his family moved to Washington D.C., after his father bought a laundry business there. He briefly attended Randolph–Macon College in Ashland, Virginia before dropping out at age 18.

==Career==

Marshall initially pursued acting, and was an extra for a local theater but this pursuit was interrupted in 1918 when he was drafted into World War I, although he was not deployed abroad. He was discharged from the U.S. Army the same year, in December 1918. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1919, he took over the two-store laundry business. In 1926, he financed the Washington Palace Five basketball team. The team folded in 1928.

In 1932, he and three other partners were awarded an NFL franchise for Boston. The team was known as the Boston Braves, as it played on the same field as baseball&#x27;s Boston Braves. After the team incurred a $46,000 loss in its first season, Marshall&#x27;s partners sold their interests to him.

In 1933, he moved the team from Braves Field to Fenway Park, which the team shared with the Boston Red Sox. He hired coach &quot;Lone Star&quot; William Henry Dietz, who claimed to be part Sioux and changed the team name from the Braves to the Redskins. Marshall said that he chose the name so that the team could keep its Native American logos.

In 1936, the team won the Eastern division and hosted the 1936 NFL Championship Game, which Marshall moved from Boston to the Polo Grounds in New York City. After a lack of support by fans despite winning the division title, he moved the team to Washington, D.C. for the 1937 season.

At the time, college football was more popular than the NFL. Marshall saw the NFL as not just a sport but as a form of entertainment and incorporated elements of college football, including gala halftime shows, a marching band, and a fight song, &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot;. To increase scoring, Marshall and George Halas, owner of the Chicago Bears, successfully suggested allowing a forward pass to be thrown from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, rather than at a minimum of five yards behind the line. He also suggested moving the goal posts from the end line to the goal line, where they were in Canadian football, to encourage the kicking of field goals. This change remained in place for about four decades until NFL goal posts were returned to the end line in the mid-1970s as part of an effort to lessen the influence on the game of kicking specialists.

Marshall also pushed to standardize the schedule so that each team played the same number of games, the teams were split into divisions with the winners meeting in a championship game, and game gate receipts were split between the home team and the visitor using by either a 60–40 split or a guaranteed amount of money, whichever was larger. During the 1937 season, Marshall rented a train and brought 10,000 fans to New York City to watch the team play the New York Giants. In 1946, he sold the laundromat business, which by then had grown to 57 locations. In the 1950s, Marshall was the first NFL owner to embrace television. He initiated the first network appearances for any NFL team and built a television network to broadcast Redskins games across the Southern United States.

In 1960, Marshall opposed the addition of the Dallas Cowboys to the NFL, ending his team&#x27;s stature as the only team south of the Mason–Dixon line. He only agreed to the addition after a rival acquired the rights to the fight song from the writer of the music and threatened to prohibit the team from playing it at games. In November 1960, Marshall sold 25% of the team to Jack Kent Cooke for $350,000. Marshall was extremely frugal and did not let the team spend money on travel expenses and salaries. He once berated Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney for driving up salaries by signing then University of Colorado&#x27;s Byron White for $15,800, then the highest contract in football in the late 1930s. One sportswriter referred to Marshall as &quot;the last of the small-time spenders.&quot;

===Racism===
As a result of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement promoted by Marshall, NFL teams did not sign black players until 1946, when two teams broke the agreement. Marshall refused to do so, claiming that integrating the team would cause the team to lose fans in the Southern United States and his team was at the time the southernmost team in the NFL. He said that &quot;We&#x27;ll start signing Negroes when the Harlem Globetrotters start signing whites.&quot;

His refusal to integrate was routinely mocked by Shirley Povich, a columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who called him &quot;one of pro football’s greatest innovators, and its leading bigot.&quot; Marshall unsuccessfully sued Povich for $200,000 after a critical article.

Marshall downplayed the issue of integration, saying &quot;I am surprised that with the world on the brink of another war they are worried about whether or not a Negro is going to play for the Redskins&quot; and doubted that &quot;the government had the right to tell the showman how to cast the play.&quot; Marshall had a long-running feud with Redskins shareholder Harry Wismer, who favored integration.

In 1961, United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and Attorney General of the United States Robert F. Kennedy issued an ultimatum: unless Marshall signed a black player, the government would revoke the Redskins&#x27; 30-year lease on D.C. Stadium (later known as RFK Memorial Stadium). Udall and Kennedy were well within their rights to take this action, since D. C. Stadium had been funded by government money and was located on federal land. As well, the Constitution vests Congress, and ipso facto the federal government, with ultimate authority over the capital.

Marshall selected Ernie Davis, Syracuse University&#x27;s All-American running back, as his top draft choice in the 1962 NFL draft. However, Davis refused to play for the team and was traded to the Cleveland Browns for All-Pro Bobby Mitchell, who became the first black player to play for the Redskins. Marshall became an enthusiastic supporter of Mitchell. The Redskins only had three winning seasons in the 23 years between the 1946 integration of the NFL and Marshall&#x27;s death in 1969. On a television show, Oscar Levant asked Marshall if he was anti-Semitic, to which he responded: &quot;Oh no, I love Jews, especially when they&#x27;re customers.&quot;

==Personal life==

His obituary in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated: &quot;Marshall considered it a lost opportunity were he not the center of attention&quot;. He had a fear of flying and never learned to drive.

In 1920, Marshall married Elizabeth Morton, a former &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; girl. They had two children, separated in 1928 and divorced in 1935. His mistress in the 1920s and 1930s was silent screen actress and &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; dancer Louise Brooks. She gave him the nickname &quot;Wet Wash&quot; because he owned a laundry chain. He was married to film actress-author Corinne Griffith from 1936 to 1957. She referred to him in print as &quot;The Marshall &quot;without&quot; a plan.&quot;

The George Preston Marshall Foundation serves the interests of children in the Washington metropolitan area. Marshall added a caveat that no money from the foundation would ever go toward &quot;any purpose which supports the principle of racial integration in any form&quot;; however, this requirement was thrown out by the courts.

==Death==

In August 1962, he underwent surgery to correct a hernia. Later, he suffered a cerebral thrombosis.

In 1963, soon after his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Marshall suffered a debilitating stroke that left him legally incompetent to manage his affairs. Three conservators were assigned to manage the football team: C. Leo DeOrsey, who owned 13% of the team and Edward Bennett Williams and Milton W. King, who each owned 5% of the team. Marshall appointed board member Edward Bennett Williams to run the team&#x27;s daily operations in 1965.

In August 1969, Marshall died in his sleep at his home in Georgetown from hemiphlagia and a heart condition, compounded by diabetes and arteriosclerosis. His funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral with a huge crowd in attendance. Marshall is buried at the family plot in Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia.

<text>Joshua David Bell (born December 9, 1967) is an American violinist and conductor. He is currently music director of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.

== Early life and education ==
Bell was born in Bloomington, Indiana, one of four children of Shirley Bell, a therapist, and Alan P. Bell, a psychologist and professor at Indiana University (IU), and former Kinsey researcher. His father was of Scottish descent and his mother was Jewish (her father was born in Mandatory Palestine and her mother was from Minsk).

Bell began playing the violin at age four after his mother discovered that he had taken rubber bands from around the house and stretched them across the handles of his nine dresser drawers to pluck out music he had heard her play on the piano. His parents got a scaled-to-size violin for him when he was five and started giving him lessons. Bell took to the instrument but had an otherwise normal Indiana childhood, playing video games and excelling at sports, especially tennis and bowling. He placed in a national tennis tournament at age ten.

Bell&#x27;s first violin teacher was Donna Bricht, widow of Indiana University music faculty member Walter Bricht. His second was Mimi Zweig, and his third the violinist and pedagog Josef Gingold, who accepted Bell as a student after his parents assured him that they were not interested in pushing their son to be a star but simply wanted him to have the best teacher for his abilities. By age 12, Bell was serious about the instrument, thanks in large part to Gingold&#x27;s inspiration.

At age 14, Bell appeared as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti. He studied violin at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music and graduated from Bloomington High School North in 1984. In 1989 Bell received an Artist Diploma in violin performance from Indiana University. IU also honored him with a Distinguished Alumni Service Award two years after his graduation. He has been named an &quot;Indiana Living Legend&quot; and received the Indiana Governor&#x27;s Arts Award.

== Career ==

Bell made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1985, at age 17, with the St. Louis Symphony. In 1990, at age 22, he went on the American Russian Young Artists Orchestra&#x27;s first tour of Russia. He has since performed with many of the world&#x27;s major orchestras and conductors. As well as the standard concerto repertoire, he has performed new works. Nicholas Maw&#x27;s violin concerto is dedicated to Bell, who premiered it in 1993 and won a Grammy Award for his recording. He performed the solo part on John Corigliano&#x27;s Oscar-winning soundtrack to the film &quot;The Red Violin&quot; and was featured in &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot;. He also appeared in the movie &quot;Music of the Heart&quot;, with other violinists.

Bell&#x27;s instrument is the Gibson ex Huberman, a Stradivarius made in 1713 during what is known as Stradivari&#x27;s &quot;Golden Era&quot;. The violin was stolen twice from its previous owner, Bronisław Huberman; the final time, the thief confessed to the act on his deathbed. Bell had played the violin; its owner at the time, violinist Norbert Brainin, jokingly told him that it could be his for $4 million. On August 3, 2001, Bell was in London to perform at The Proms; before the concert he was approached by J &amp; A Beare. He learned that the violin was in London and about to be sold to a German industrialist to become part of a collection. Bell played the violin at the Proms that same evening. He later sold his previous violin, the Tom Taylor Stradivarius, for a little more than $2 million and bought the Gibson ex Huberman for a little under the $4 million asking price. The 2013 documentary &quot;The Return of the Violin&quot; tells the story of the instrument&#x27;s theft, return, and subsequent acquisition by Bell. Bell&#x27;s first recording with the Gibson ex Huberman was &quot;Romance of the Violin&quot; for Sony Classical Records in 2003.

Bell served as artistic partner for the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra from 2004 until 2007, and as a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He also serves on the artists&#x27; selection committee for the Kennedy Center Honors and is an adjunct associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bell won the Avery Fisher Prize on April 10, 2007, at Lincoln Center in New York City. The prize is given once every few years to classical instrumentalists for outstanding achievement. On May 3, 2007, Indiana University&#x27;s Jacobs School of Music announced that Bell had joined the faculty as a senior lecturer.

In 2008, Bell received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Bell collaborated with Hans Zimmer by providing violin solos for the soundtrack of the 2009 film &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, based on Dan Brown&#x27;s 2000 novel of the same name.

In May 2011, the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (ASMF) named Bell its music director. He has recorded commercially with the ASMF for the Sony Classical label. In July 2017, the ASMF announced a three-year extension of his contract, through 2020. Bell and the orchestra won the 2017 Helpmann Award for Best Individual Classical Music Performance. In April 2024, the ASMF announced an additional extension of Bell&#x27;s contract as its music director through August 2028.

In 2013, Bell accompanied Scarlett Johansson in the song &quot;Before My Time&quot;. Written by J. Ralph for the documentary &quot;Chasing Ice&quot;, it received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Bell played himself in three episodes of &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot; in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In 2016, he had a cameo in the penultimate musical episode of &quot;Royal Pains&quot;. He also appeared as himself in episode 8 (&quot;Quacktice Makes Perfect&quot;) of the 2017 Netflix original series &quot;Julie&#x27;s Greenroom&quot;.

In October 2024, the New Jersey Symphony announced the appointment of Bell as its new principal guest conductor, effective with the 2025–2026 season, with an initial contract of four seasons.

== &quot;Washington Post&quot; experiment ==
In an experiment initiated by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Gene Weingarten, Bell donned a baseball cap and played as an incognito busker at the Metro subway station L&#x27;Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C., on January 12, 2007. The experiment was videotaped on hidden camera; of the 1,097 people who passed by, seven stopped to listen to him, and one recognized him. For his nearly 45-minute performance, Bell collected $32.17 from 27 passersby (excluding $20 from the one who recognized him). Three days earlier, he earned considerably more playing the same repertoire at a concert. Weingarten won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his article on the experiment. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; posted the video on YouTube and a feature-length documentary, &quot;Find Your Way: A Busker&#x27;s Documentary&quot;, chronicled Bell&#x27;s experience. A somewhat inaccurate retelling of the story went viral.

== Personal life ==
Bell and his former partner, Lisa Matricardi, have three sons: Josef (born 2007), and twins Benjamin and Samuel (born 2010). On October 5, 2019, Bell married opera singer Larisa Martinez at their home in Mount Kisco, New York. They also live in the Gramercy Park neighborhood of Manhattan.

<text>Brock University is a public research university in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. It is the only university in Canada in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, at the centre of Canada&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula on the Niagara Escarpment. The university bears the name of Maj.-General Sir Isaac Brock, who was responsible for defending Upper Canada against the United States during the War of 1812.

Brock offers a wide range of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including professional degrees. Brock was ranked third among Canadian universities in the undergraduate category for research publication output and impact indicators in 2008 (the most recent ranking completed). Brock University is the only school in Canada and internationally to offer the MICA (Mathematics Integrated with Computing and Applications) program. Brock University&#x27;s Department of Health Sciences offers the only undergraduate degree in Public Health in Canada. At the graduate level, Brock offers 49 programs, including nine PhD programs.

Brock&#x27;s co-op program is Canada&#x27;s fifth-largest, and the third largest in Ontario as of 2011. Graduates enjoy one of the highest employment rates of all Ontario universities at 97.2 percent.

Brock has 12 Canada Research Chairs and nine faculty members who have received the 3M Teaching Fellowship Award, the only national award that recognizes teaching excellence and educational leadership.
==History==
In 1963 the Brock University Founders&#x27; Committee, chaired by Arthur Schmon and co-chaired by William B Gunning, offered Dr. James A. Gibson the invitation to become the founding president.

Brock University was established by the passage of the Brock University Act by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1964. When the university first opened in September 1964, classes were held at the St. Paul Street United Church in downtown St. Catharines for 13 weeks until the Glenridge Campus was completely renovated.

Brock&#x27;s Glenridge campus was officially opened on October 19, 1964 with Gibson as the university&#x27;s founding president. In 1996 Brock University honoured Gibson by naming the university library in his honour.

Richard L. Hearn was appointed the university&#x27;s inaugural chancellor in 1967. Canadian Cree actress Shirley Cheechoo was Chancellor from 2015 to 2020.

Brock University is named after Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, who commanded the British and Canadian forces during the War of 1812. Although the British and Canadian forces went on to win, Brock lost his life during the Battle of Queenston Heights in 1812, fought from the present-day site of the campus. His last words are said to have been &quot;Surgite!&quot; (Latin for &quot;push on&quot;) — now used as the university&#x27;s motto. For his contribution to Canada, Brock was voted the 28th Greatest Canadian in a 2004 poll, conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Main campus and residences==

=== Isaac Brock Plaza ===
Using a blend of new construction and major upgrades of existing space, the project will grow Goodman School of Business from its current 50,526 sq. ft. to 76,758 sq. ft.

A feature will be the two-storey glass “engagement atrium” at the west end of the complex.

Taro Hall&#x27;s nine current classrooms will be extensively renovated with new floors, ceilings, furniture, accessibility, lighting and technology, and all existing offices and spaces will either be enlarged or renovated with new flooring and fixtures.

=== Arthur Schmon Tower===
 The Arthur Schmon Tower was built in 1968 and houses the administrative offices for the university. Schmon was the primary force behind getting a university established in the Niagara peninsula and was the chairman of the Brock University Founders&#x27; Committee, formed in 1962. The Schmon Tower, along with the surrounding Thistle Complex, are characterized by their distinctive brutalist architecture.

The Schmon Tower also houses the James A. Gibson Library, named for founding president of the university James Alexander Gibson, which serves as the academic library for the university and is a member of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries. The main floor of the library consists of the Matheson Learning Commons which includes computer workstations, study rooms, multimedia classrooms, and the library&#x27;s circulation and information desk.

Welch Hall is home to Brock&#x27;s Faculty of Education, the Instructional Resource Centre, as well as the David S. Howes Theatre. It recently underwent an expansion, designed by Diamond and Schmitt Architects and costing in excess of $8 million, which added additional lecture halls and administrative offices as well as upgrades to Welch Hall&#x27;s facilities.

===Mackenzie Chown Complex===
Designed by Canadian architect Raymond Moriyama, who also served as Chancellor of Brock, the Mackenzie Chown Complex primarily contains seminar rooms and science laboratories. The Mackenzie Chown Complex also houses the Pond Inlet convention space and the Map, Data &amp; GIS Library. It was named for Mackenzie Chown, a former mayor of St. Catharines who served as chairman of the Brock Board of Trustees and chairman of the fundraising committee for a new science laboratory building to be added to the Complex.
===Plaza Building===
Completed in 2007, and designed by MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects, the Plaza Building contains the Faculty of Social Sciences, as well as computer facilities, seminar rooms, and the new Brock Campus Bookstore.

The Cairns Family Health and Bioscience Research Complex was completed in 2012. Designed by architectsAlliance, Toronto, Canada with lab design by Payette Associates of Boston, Massachusetts, USA, this building contains the University&#x27;s most advanced research laboratories. It is intended to advance Canada&#x27;s science and technology infrastructure and position Brock as a leader in human health and biosciences. CFHBRC researchers, who include six Canada Research Chairs, conduct research in areas such as cancer treatments, infectious diseases, biotechnology and green chemistry.

The facility houses the BioLinc business incubator to forge partnerships between research and industry, and stimulate an economic cluster in advanced health studies and biomanufacturing in the Niagara Region. The complex is also home to the Niagara Campus of the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine.

The CFHBRC was developed based on principles of sustainability and quality environments, following the Canadian Green Building Council&#x27;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system. Construction of the CFHBRC began in August 2009, and it officially opened in September 2012.

===Rankin Family Pavilion===
Established in 2019 and funded by LINC and the Rankin family - this new building is Brock&#x27;s latest and grandest change.

===Residences===

Brock&#x27;s St. Catharines on-campus residence system can accommodate up to 2,777 students. There are eight residence buildings that can be categorized in three ways (traditional, semi-suite and townhouse). The majority of residents are first-year students. There is a sizable population of upper-year students who live in residence, typically in the Brock Suites designated areas. All residence students have access to two dining halls which are operated by Aramark under the Fresh Food Company brand. The residence dining halls are located in the DeCew and Lowenberger buildings.

* DeCew is the oldest of the residences; it was built in 1969 and designed by architect John Andrews in association with St. Catharines architects Salter Fleming Secord. DeCew contains 411 beds in a traditional residence style building. DeCew is undergoing a major multi-phase renovation beginning in Spring 2019.
* Gordon and Betty Vallee Residence, commonly referred to as &quot;Vallee&quot;, is a semi-suite residence built in 1995. All of the rooms are single rooms with a washroom shared between two students.
* Quarry View Residence opened in the fall of 2003. It contains 250 single-room beds and 40 double room beds divided into three- or four-person units. Quarry View is a townhouse-style residence where students have a common living area and a full-size kitchen.
* Arnie Lowenberger Residence is a semi-suite style residence similar to Vallee and Earp residences, however a double room and a single room share an adjoining bathroom. The residence is named for Dr. Arnie Lowenberger, Athletic Director and Dean of Physical Education. He was also the first Director of Residences at Brock University.
* Village Residence contains 888 beds. It was originally opened in 1989 and expanded in 1993, 1998, and 2002. It is a townhouse style residence (five students in three single rooms and one double room share a common living space and kitchen).
* Alan Earp Residence was officially opened in 2001, and is home to 255 students. The building was designed by Moriyama and Teshima Architects. The building is very similar to Vallee Residence, in that all of its rooms are single rooms with a washroom shared between two students.

The enabling legislation is the &quot;Brock University Act, S.O. 1964.&quot; Many of the buildings on campus were designed by the architectural firm Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects.

The Brock Centre for the Arts is located on campus and features two large theatres, The Sean O&#x27;Sullivan (537 seats) and The David S. Howes (508 seats). The centre presents some figures in Canadian arts and entertainment, academics, and politics, and attracts general audiences from the Niagara Region.

==Hamilton Campus (2000-2023) and Burlington Campus (2023-present)==
Brock University also maintained a satellite campus in the city of Hamilton, Ontario. The primary user of this facility was the Faculty of Education, specifically the Teacher Education Department and Graduate Studies in Education and Continuing Education.

The Hamilton Campus was officially opened November 2, 2000. It was a campus with computer labs, an Instructional Resource Centre / Library, gymnasium, large classrooms, full and part-time faculty office space, food services, conference facilities, a board room, and green spaces within the courtyards and surrounding lawns of the campus.

The Hamilton Campus closed and moved to a new location in the Burlington area in 2023. In partnership with the City of Burlington, the University plans to relocate to the site of the former Robert Bateman High School.

==Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts==
Construction began in the fall of 2012 on the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts in downtown St. Catharines. The facility was designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects and included the adaptive reuse of the Canada Hair Cloth Company, a five-storey brick and timber frame building from the 19th century.

After extensive work totalling $46 million, the Walker School&#x27;s new home opened its doors in 2015, becoming the newest centre for the arts and culture industry in Niagara Region. The purpose-built facility houses 50 full-time faculty, part-time instructors and staff and more than 500 students. It will serve students pursuing careers as artists, theatre directors, actors, musicians, cultural theorists and skilled teachers. The creation of the centre was hoped to regenerate downtown St. Catharines and gain traffic from the influx of students. Brock chose not to include food services in the facility to further integrate student life and activity with the downtown neighbourhood.

The Walker School is neighbours with St. Catharines&#x27; new FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre, located on adjacent lands. Construction of the $100 plus-million project, which was also designed by Diamond Schmitt, was completed in time for the Fall 2015 semester. The centre opened officially in November, with Brock agreeing to use two of the four theatres in the centre for daytime lectures, music recital and performance.

==Rodman Hall Art Centre==
The School of Fine and Performing Arts owned Rodman Hall from 2003 until 2020. It was used as a downtown art gallery and teaching centre. The Centre provided exhibit space, fine art services and resources to the students and faculty of Brock University. Nationally, Rodman Hall supported the development of artists and cultural workers in southern Ontario through the dissemination of contemporary art, the management of the region&#x27;s pre-eminent art collection, and the preservation of a significant historic house and gardens.

The site was purchased by a local developer from The University in 2020, converted to a hotel and event space, and renamed the Rodman Hall Boutique Hotel and Events Centre.

<text>Carl Weathers (January 14, 1948 – February 2, 2024) was an American actor, director and gridiron football player. His prominent roles included boxer Apollo Creed in the first four &quot;Rocky&quot; films (1976–1985), Colonel Al Dillon in &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), Chubbs Peterson in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996), and Combat Carl in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise. He also portrayed Det. Beaudreaux in the television series &quot;Street Justice&quot; (1991–1993) and a fictionalized version of himself in the comedy series &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2004, 2013), and voiced Omnitraxus Prime in &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot; (2017–2019). He had a recurring role as Greef Karga in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–2023), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

Weathers played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs before playing professionally as a linebacker. He joined the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) after going undrafted in the 1970 NFL draft. After two seasons with the Raiders, he played three seasons with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL).

==Early life==
Weathers was born on January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father was a day laborer. As an eighth-grade student, he earned an athletic scholarship to St. Augustine High School, a private school. He was an all-around athlete, involved in boxing, football, gymnastics, judo, soccer, and wrestling. He played football and graduated from Long Beach Poly High School in 1966.

==College football career==
Weathers played football as a defensive end in college. He started his college career in 1966 at Long Beach City College, where he did not play in 1966 due to an ankle injury suffered when he tripped over a curb surrounding the running track while warming up for practice with another linebacker. He then transferred and played for San Diego State University, becoming a letterman for the San Diego State Aztecs in 1968 and 1969, helping the Aztecs win the 1969 Pasadena Bowl, finishing with an 11–0 record, and a No. 18 ranking in the Final UPI Poll, playing for head coach Don Coryell. At San Diego State, Weathers—who considered acting his first love and had been performing in plays even back in grade school—received a master in theatre arts.

== Professional football career ==
Weathers signed with the Oakland Raiders of the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 1970. Now playing as a linebacker, Weathers played in seven games for the Raiders in 1970, helping them win the AFC West Division title, on their way to the first-ever AFC Championship Game. Before the 1971 season, Weathers converted to the position of strong safety. He played in one game of the 1971 NFL season before the Raiders released him in September 1971, after head coach John Madden told Weathers, &quot;You&#x27;re just too sensitive.&quot;

Later that month, Weathers signed with the BC Lions of the CFL. He played for the Lions until 1973, playing 13 games in total. During the off-seasons, Weathers attended San Francisco State University and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama in 1974.

Weathers retired from football in 1974, and began pursuing an acting career. In his NFL career he appeared in 8 games in two seasons, but did not record any stats. The only stat he recorded in his CFL career was a single fumble recovery. In later years, Weathers narrated NFL Films&#x27; season recap of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 seasons. During the 2017 NFL draft, he appeared on NFL Network&#x27;s pre-draft coverage.

==Acting career==

Weathers began working as an extra while still playing football. He had his first significant roles in two blaxploitation films directed by his longtime friend Arthur Marks: and . Weathers also appeared in an early 1975 episode of the sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; titled &quot;The Nude&quot;, portraying an angry husband who suspected his wife of cheating on him with J.J. He also guest-starred in a 1975 episode of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; titled &quot;The Brothers Caine&quot;, and in an episode of &quot;Cannon&quot; titled &quot;The Hero&quot;. In 1976, he appeared as a loan shark in an episode of the crime-drama &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, and in the &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; episode &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; as escaped convict Jack Hopper.

While auditioning for the role of Apollo Creed alongside Sylvester Stallone in &quot;Rocky&quot;, Weathers criticized Stallone&#x27;s acting, which led to him getting the role. He reprised the role of Apollo Creed in the next three &quot;Rocky&quot; films: &quot;Rocky II&quot; (1979), &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982), and &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985).

Weathers briefly appears as an Army MP in one of the three released versions of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (originally released in 1977). In 1978, Weathers portrayed Vince Sullivan in a TV movie, &quot;Not This Time&quot;. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Weathers starred in a number of action films for the small and big screen, including , , , and . Weathers hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1988 and appeared in a skit on the show in 2003.

Weathers appeared in Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; music video and co-starred in the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, as Chubbs, a golf legend teaching Happy how to play golf. He reprised the role nearly four years later in the Sandler comedy &quot;Little Nicky&quot;. Filming a fall stunt in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, Weathers fractured two vertebrae and his osteophytes grew out and connected and self-fused badly. He said he was in excruciating pain for three to four years.

Another notable television role was Sgt. Adam Beaudreaux on the cop show &quot;Street Justice&quot;. Afterwards, during the final two seasons of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1992–1994), his character, Hampton Forbes, replaced Bill Gillespie as the chief of police. He also played MACV-SOG Colonel Brewster in the CBS series &quot;Tour of Duty.&quot;

In 2004, Weathers received a career revival as a comedic actor beginning with appearances in three episodes of the comedy series &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as a cheapskate caricature of himself, who serves as Tobias Fünke&#x27;s acting coach. He was then cast in the comedies &quot;The Sasquatch Gang&quot; and &quot;The Comebacks.&quot; Weathers had a guest role in two episodes of &quot;The Shield&quot; as the former training officer of main character Vic Mackey.

Weathers provided the voice for Colonel Samuel Garrett in the Pandemic Studios video game &quot;.&quot; In 2005, he was a narrator on &quot;Conquest! The Price of Victory — Witness the Journey of the Trojans!,&quot; an 18-part television show about USC athletics. Weathers was a principal of Red Tight Media, a film and video production company that specializes in tactical training films made for the United States armed forces. He also appeared in one episode of &quot;ER&quot; in 2008 during its finale season.

For the sixth film in the &quot;Rocky&quot; series, &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006), Stallone asked Weathers, Mr. T, and Dolph Lundgren for permission to use footage from their appearances in the earlier &quot;Rocky&quot; films. Mr. T and Lundgren agreed, but Weathers wanted an actual part in the movie, even though his character had died in &quot;Rocky IV&quot;. Stallone refused, and Weathers decided not to allow Stallone to use his image for flashbacks from the previous films. They instead used footage of a fighter who looks similar to Weathers. Weathers and Stallone patched up their differences and Weathers agreed to allow footage of him from previous films to be used throughout &quot;Creed&quot; (2015).

Weathers portrayed the father of Michael Strahan and Daryl &quot;Chill&quot; Mitchell&#x27;s characters on the short-lived 2009 Fox sitcom &quot;Brothers&quot;. Weathers acted as Brian &quot;Gebo&quot; Fitzgerald in advertising for Old Spice&#x27;s sponsorship of NASCAR driver Tony Stewart. He also appeared in an ongoing series of web-only advertisements for Credit Union of Washington, dispensing flowers and the advice that &quot;change is beautiful&quot; to puzzled-looking bystanders. He also starred in a series of commercials for Bud Light, in which he introduced plays from the &quot;Bud Light Playbook.&quot; At the conclusion of each commercial, Weathers could be seen bursting through the Bud Light Playbook and shouting &quot;Here we go!&quot;

In 2019, Weathers appeared as Greef Karga in several episodes of the first season of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. He returned for the second season and also directed the episode &quot;Chapter 12: The Siege&quot;. He returned for season 3 and directed the episode &quot;Chapter 20: The Foundling&quot;. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor.

==Personal life==
Weathers was married three times. He married Mary-Ann Castle in 1973; they had two sons and divorced in 1983. In 1984, Weathers married Rhona Unsell; they divorced in 2006. Weathers was married to Jennifer Peterson from 2007 until 2009. Weathers was with his longtime partner Christine Kludjian from 2014, until his death in 2024.

<doc id="394825" wikidata="Q5639223" url="?curid=394825" title="Hail to the Commanders">
<text>&quot;Hail to the Commanders&quot; is the fight song of the Washington Commanders, an American football team belonging to the National Football League (NFL). At home games, the song is performed by the Washington Commanders Marching Band when the team scores a touchdown. 

The music was composed in 1937 by Barnee Breeskin with lyrics written by Corinne Griffith, the wife of franchise founder George Preston Marshall. The musical arrangement and lyrics have since gone through various revisions. The song was known as &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot; until the retirement of the Redskins branding in 2020.

==History==

In 1937, Marshall moved the team from Boston to Washington, D.C. With this move and the introduction of his team to the nation&#x27;s capital, Marshall commissioned a 110-member marching band to provide the new fans with the &quot;pomp and circumstance&quot; and &quot;pageantry&quot; of a public victory parade. Marshall said he wanted his team and their games to emulate the spectacle of gladiators at the Colosseum. He also wanted to incorporate elements of the college football experience into the pro game. He outfitted the band with $25,000 of uniforms and instruments and asked the band leader, Barnee Breeskin, to compose a fight song worthy of such a team of gladiators and warriors.

The original lyrics were written by Marshall&#x27;s wife Corinne Griffith to reflect the Native American warrior imagery of the team as the &quot;Redskins&quot;. The lyrics were later reworked to be less offensive to contemporary sensibilities, although the Redskins name became increasingly criticized as a racial slur. Washington began playing the song at home games for the 1938 season. &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot; is the second oldest fight song for a professional American football team; the oldest fight song is &quot;Go! You Packers! Go!&quot;, composed in 1931 for the Green Bay Packers.

The original fight song lyrics are as follows:
:: &quot;Hail to the Redskins! Hail Vic-to-ry!&quot;
:: &quot;Braves on the warpath, Fight for old D.C.&quot;
:: &quot;Scalp &#x27;em, Swamp &#x27;em, We will take-em big score!&quot;
:: &quot;Read &#x27;em, Weep &#x27;em, Touchdown—we want heap more!&quot;
:: &quot;Fight on, Fight on till you have won,&quot;
:: &quot;Sons of Wash-ing-ton (Rah! Rah! Rah!)&quot;
:: &quot;Hail to the Redskins! Hail Vic-to-ry!&quot;
:: &quot;Braves on the warpath, Fight! For old D.C.&quot;

==Revisions==
The first revision, in 1959, replaced &quot;D.C&quot; with &quot;Dixie.&quot;The song&#x27;s original first stanza had evolved into the line &quot;Fight for old Dixie&quot;, while earlier arrangements of the song closed to the opening of the southern folk song &quot;Dixie&quot; played as a countermelody. In 1963, the lyrics were changed from Dixie back to the original &quot;D.C.&quot;, evidenced by a 1963 Media Guide.

The Redskins played south of the Mason-Dixon line, and as there were no established NFL teams in the region until the 1960s, Marshall aggressively marketed his franchise as &quot;Team of the South&quot;. He would recruit players from Southern schools, refuse to employ black players (until 1962), feature Southern bands at halftime, and sign contracts to feature the team on Southern radio networks and television networks. 

In July 1965, a black Washington fan wrote to the owner of the team, describing the racial unrest that &quot;Dixie&quot; caused and asking for it to be stopped. According to an article in &quot;The Washington Afro-American&quot; of October 23, 1965, &quot;Dixie&quot; was no longer played as a countermelody that year.

In 1972, the lyrics were altered after representatives of Native American groups raised concerns about lines that referred to the practice of scalping and used non-standard grammar in a stereotype of Native American speech. 

Team president Edward Bennett Williams met with a delegation of Native Americans representatives, including Dennis Banks from the American Indian Movement; LaDonna Harris, president of Americans for Indian Opportunity; and Leon Cole, president of the National Congress of American Indians. They asked him to replace the team nickname, retire the female &quot;Redskinette&quot; dancers in pseudo-native dress, and change the lyrics to the fight song. 

Williams listened to their concerns, but in the end he only changed the song lyrics, saying, &quot;The &#x27;swamp &#x27;ems,&#x27; &#x27;scalp &#x27;ems,&#x27; and &#x27;heap &#x27;ems&#x27; is a mockery of dialect. We won’t use those lyrics anymore.&quot; 

The modified third and fourth lines were:

:: &quot;Run or pass and score, We want a lot more!&quot;
:: &quot;Beat &#x27;em, swamp &#x27;em, Touchdown—let the points soar!&quot;

Playing of &quot;Hail to the Redskins!&quot; was halted at home games in 2020 and 2021 when the franchise abandoned its controversial team nickname. The song was restored upon the Commanders rebranding in 2022, with the phrase &quot;Braves on the Warpath&quot; replaced by &quot;Fight for our Commanders&quot; via an online fan vote. The current lyrics are as follows:

:: &quot;Hail to the Commanders! Hail Victory!&quot;
:: &quot;Fight for our Commanders! Fight for Old DC!&quot;
:: &quot;Run or pass and score, we want a lot more!&quot;
:: &quot;Beat &#x27;em, Swamp &#x27;em, Touchdown! Let the points soar!&quot;
:: &quot;Fight on! Fight on! Til you have won!&quot;
:: &quot;All of Washington! Rah! Rah! Rah!&quot;
:: &quot;Hail to the Commanders! Hail Victory!&quot;
:: &quot;Fight for our Commanders! Fight for Old DC!&quot;

== Dallas Cowboys incident ==
When the NFL began considering expansion to Texas, Marshall strongly opposed the move, as it would end his three-decade monopoly on pro football in the South. In 1958, potential owner Clint Murchison, who was trying to bring the NFL to Dallas, bought the rights to &quot;Hail to the Redskins&quot; from a disgruntled Breeskin and threatened to prevent Marshall from playing it at games. Marshall agreed to back Murchison&#x27;s bid, Murchison gave him back the rights to the song, and the Dallas Cowboys were founded. Marshall immediately revised the lyrics, changing &quot;Fight for old D.C.&quot; to &quot;Fight for old Dixie&quot; in an attempt to retain the south as exclusive fans of the Washington Redskins.

==Other usage==
The LG Twins of the Korea Baseball Organization use the song&#x27;s melody in their own fight song.

<text>Scott Eugene Fischer (December 24, 1955 – May 11, 1996) was an American mountaineer and mountain guide. He was renowned for ascending the world&#x27;s highest mountains without supplemental oxygen. Fischer and Wally Berg were the first Americans to summit Lhotse (27,940 feet / 8516 m), the world&#x27;s fourth highest peak. Fischer, Charley Mace, and Ed Viesturs summitted K2 (28,251 feet/ 8611m) without supplemental oxygen. Fischer first climbed Mount Everest (29,032 feet / 8,848.86 m) in 1994 and later died during the 1996 blizzard on Everest while descending from the peak.

==Early life==
Fischer was the son of Shirley and Gene Fischer and was of German, Dutch, and Hungarian ancestry. He spent his early life in Michigan and New Jersey. After watching a TV documentary in 1970 in his home in the Basking Ridge section of Bernards Township, New Jersey, about the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) with his father, he headed to the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming for the summer. While attending Ridge High School, from which he graduated in 1973, he spent his summers in the mountains with NOLS, eventually becoming a full-time senior NOLS instructor.

==Career==
In 1977, Fischer attended an ice climbing seminar by Jeff Lowe in Utah. A group of climbers scaled the frozen Bridal Veil Falls in Provo Canyon. During the climb, Fischer began to climb solo on the near-vertical ice formation when his ice axe broke, leaving him stranded. The others managed to get him a new axe, but when he ascended again, the tool popped out and he fell hundreds of feet. He survived but injured his foot with his ice axe as he fell.

In 1984, Fischer and Wes Krause became the second-ever team to scale the Breach Icicle on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa after Reinhold Messner and Konrad Renzler in 1978. A few months later they came to Nepal for the autumn climbing season and tried to reach the Annapurna Fang just because of its cheap permit and total cost. On descend Krause was injured but both survived.

That same year Fischer and two friends, Wes Krause and Michael Allison, each chipped in $500 and founded &quot;Mountain Madness&quot;, an adventure travel service (quite soon Allison moved to Atlanta and sold them his share). Fischer and Krause guided clients in climbing major mountain peaks worldwide, but later Krause who lived in Kenya put his effort on Africa (Kilimanjaro route and safari).

In the summer of 1986, Fischer, Krause, and Robert Birkby went to Soviet Union and reached Elbrus (Caucasus Mountains). Fischer and Krause also tried to summit Ushba but failed. Later Fischer and Birkby made “a walk” to Ushba: while descending the icefall Fischer fell into a crevasse, dragging his friend along. Birkby was able to anchor with his ice ax, ensuring their safety. That same year Fischer and Krause organised another group to reach the highest soviet mountain Communism Peak (Pamir). They reached the summit together with Stacy Allison, the best of many of Fischer’s students. One climber of the team fell sick in a lower camp; Fischer and Wes tried to evacuate him, but unfortunately he died on the slope.

In the autumn of 1987, Fischer and Krause organised trip to China, trying to reach Mount Everest from Tibet via the Northern Wall. To finance their own climbs they usually organized base camp trekking trips for clients of &quot;Mountain Madness&quot;, so Fischer’s mother Shirley was in Everest base camp (probably first time in Mount Everest history a climber was with his mother). Fischer, Krause, Stacy Allison, and Samuel Belk had spent four nights in Camp IV waiting for weather but were forced to go down because of strong wind and snowfalls.

Returning to Seattle, Fischer had sent two resumes to the 1988 American Everest expedition (South route): Allison&#x27;s and his own. He persuaded her at least to go for an interview. As a result, he was rejected but Allison was invited to join the team. Consequently, in 1988 she went to Nepal and became the first American woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Fischer was trekking to Kala Patthar and they met each other at the Everest base camp.

In 1990, Fischer and Wally Berg became the first Americans to summit Lhotse (27,940 feet / 8516 m), the world&#x27;s fourth highest peak, as a part of Glenn Porzak&#x27;s Everest — Lhotse expedition. At EBC he met Rob Hall, Gary Ball, Peter Hillary, and Tim Macartney-Snape. All of them made a summit on the same day as Porzak‘s team. Fischer and Berg were in Camp III ready for their Lhotse attempt, but first had to go up to the Yellow Band in order to evacuate their teammate Mike Brauning from the South Col into Camp II. The next morning they returned to Camp III and, after a short rest, advanced to camp IV. The next morning on May 13, the birthday of Fischer’s son Andy, they reached the summit. Fischer was upset with the achievement as his real goal was Everest, but being a few days off schedule he didn’t have the time nor resources for it. Additionally, no one was on the Everest slopes at the time to help ensure the ropes and ladders installed by the Nepali Army Everest team on the Khumbu Icefall for the 1990 climbing season hadn&#x27;t been removed.

In 1992, during the climb on K2 as a part of a Russian-American expedition, Fischer fell into a crevasse and tore the rotator cuff of his right shoulder. Against his doctor&#x27;s advice, Fischer spent two weeks trying to recover and asked climbing partner Ed Viesturs to tape his shoulder and tether it to his waist so it would not continue to dislocate. He then resumed the climb using only his left arm. On their first summit bid, the climbers abandoned their attempt at Camp III to rescue Aleskei Nikiforov, Thor Keiser, and Chantal Mauduit. Fischer, Viesturs, and Charley Mace reached the summit on their second attempt without supplemental oxygen. During their descent, they met climbers Rob Hall and Gary Ball, who were suffering from altitude sickness at Camp II. Hall&#x27;s health improved along the descent, but Ball required subsequent help from Fischer and the other climbers to reach the base of the mountain.

Through Mountain Madness, Fischer guided the 1993 Climb for the Cure on Denali (20,320 feet) in Alaska which eight students at Princeton University organized. The expedition raised $280,000 for the American Foundation for AIDS Research. In 1994, Fischer and Rob Hess climbed Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen. They also formed a part of the expedition that removed 5000 pounds of trash and 150 discarded oxygen bottles from Everest. With the climb, Fischer had climbed the top of the highest peaks on six of the seven continents, except Vinson Massif in Antarctica. The American Alpine Club awarded the David Brower Conservation Award to all expedition members. In January 1996, Fischer and Mountain Madness guided a fundraising ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro (19,341 feet / 5,895 m) in Africa.

==Death==

In May 1996, Fischer guided eight clients in climbing Everest. He was assisted by Neal Beidleman, Anatoli Boukreev, and eight Sherpas, led by Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa. On May 6, the Mountain Madness team left Base Camp (5,364 meters) for their summit climb. At Camp II (6,400 meters), Fischer learned that his friend Dale Kruse was ill and could not make it out of Camp I (6,000 m). Fischer descended from Camp II, met with Kruse, and continued to Base Camp with him. Leaving Kruse at Base Camp, he ascended to rejoin his team at Camp II. He was slow on ascent to Camp III (7,200 m) the following day, and on May 9, he left Camp III for Camp IV at the South Col (7,950 m). On May 10, Fischer reached the summit after 3:45 PM, much later than the safe turnaround time of 2:00 PM due to his team climbing much slower than expected. He was exhausted from previous efforts and the ascent and became increasingly ill, possibly suffering from HAPE, HACE, or a combination of both.

His climbing partner, Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa, descended part of the way with him when a blizzard started. Near the Southeast ridge balcony (8,400m), Fischer asked Lopsang to descend without him and send back Boukreev for help. After the storm subsided, on May 11, two Sherpas reached Fischer and &quot;Makalu&quot; Gau Ming-Ho, leader of a Taiwanese expedition. Fischer was unresponsive, and the Sherpas placed an oxygen mask over his face before carrying Gau to Camp IV. After rescuing other people, Boukreev finally reached Fischer, who was already dead. He described Fischer as having exhibited paradoxical undressing, commonly associated with hypothermia. &quot;His oxygen mask is around face, but bottle is empty. He is not wearing mittens; hands completely bare. Down suit is unzipped, pulled off his shoulder, one arm is outside clothing. There is nothing I can do. Scott is dead.&quot; Boukreev shrouded Fischer&#x27;s upper torso and moved his body off the main climbing route. His body remains on the mountain.

Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa died in an avalanche in the autumn of 1996, also on an expedition to Everest, and Boukreev died in December 1997 in an avalanche on an expedition to Annapurna. Fischer&#x27;s climbing firm Mountain Madness was bought in 1997 by Keith and Christine Boskoff.

==Personal life==
In 1981, Fischer married Jeannie Price, who was his student on a NOLS Mountaineering Course in 1974. They moved to Seattle in 1982 where they had two children, Andy and Katie Rose Fischer-Price.

==Legacy==

*A memorial stupa for Fischer was built by the Sherpas in 1996 outside the village of Dughla in the Solukhumbu District of Nepal. In 1997, Ingrid Hunt, the doctor who had accompanied the 1996 Mountain Madness Everest Expedition to Base Camp, returned to place a bronze memorial plaque on it in his honor.
*The American Alpine Club established the Scott Fischer Memorial Conservation Fund in his memory which helps environmentally proactive expeditions throughout the world.
*A route up Mount Kilimanjaro is dedicated to Fischer. This route is called the Western-Breach Route. There is a plaque in memorial for Fischer along this route.

===In popular culture===
*In the 1997 TV movie &quot;Into Thin Air: Death on Everest&quot;, Fischer is portrayed by Peter Horton.
*In the 2015 film &quot;Everest&quot;, Fischer is portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal.

<doc id="394832" wikidata="Q4400003" url="?curid=394832" title="Plate number coil">
<text>A plate number coil (PNC) is a United States postage stamp with the number of the printing plate or plates printed on it. The plate number typically appears as one or more small digits in the margin at the bottom of the stamp. The plate number may be centered or, on some coil issues, located toward the right. Although most plate numbers are composed of just numbers, both a combination of letter and number may be used. In the case when a letter is represented in the plate number, an upper case letter usually appears at the beginning or at the end of the sequence with the former serving as a good identifier of the stamp printer.

The plate number is on one stamp out of the number of stamps printed by a single revolution of rotary printing press used to print the stamps. The interval numbers have ranged from 7 to 52.

The first coil stamp was produced in USA with plate numbers printed on periodic stamps was the 18¢ Flag of 1981.

Collectors specializing in PNC collecting typically save plate number coils in the following formats:
# PNC5 - Plate Number Coil 5 - A strip of 5 mint stamps with the plate number coil on the center stamp.
# PNC3 - Plate Number Coil 3 - A strip of 3 mint stamps with the plate number coil on the center stamp. Although many collectors still collect coils in this format, a larger number of these collectors prefers the PNC5 format. As a result, a PNC3 is less desirable than a PNC5 as evidenced by many specialized stamp catalogs now assigning much higher premiums to PNC5 formats of earlier coil issues. Initially, saving PNC3s had been the practice adopted by many collectors and dealers alike and, therefore, not many early issues were saved in the longer format.
# PNS - Plate Number Single - A single unused or used plate number coil stamp. If used, the plate number must be identifiable and not be obliterated by the postmark, although many precanceled issues, in order to show their proper use and to be collectible, should not receive any postmarks.
# On cover - An envelope bearing a used plate number coil stamp with a contemporary postmark tying the stamp to the envelope. Many collectors prefer the cover to have the correct postage and proper stamp or stamps used for the envelope. An example of an improper use is to combine many precanceled stamps and older issues on an envelope as payment for a first class postage. Although this practice is allowed by the Post Office, most collectors find this and stamp collector contrived or philatelic covers less desirable.

Some coil issues will require collectors to save longer than even the PNC5 mentioned earlier. For example, the United States Crops coil stamps, issued in 2006, have five designs with only one of the stamp designs bearing a plate number. While some collectors will save this issue as a PNC5 and no shorter, others may choose to save it as a PNC11 so that the stamps of the same design with and without the plate number are represented.

<text>Ralph Maxwell Lewis (February 14, 1904 – January 12, 1987), was an American mystic and the second Imperator of the Rosicrucian organisation AMORC from 1939 to 1987. He is the author of a number of books regarding mysticism. His father, Harvey Spencer Lewis, was the first Imperator of AMORC.

==Early life and education==
Lewis was born to Harvey Spencer Lewis and Mollie Foldsmith Lewis February 14, 1904, in New York City. He received his early education in New York and the New Jersey Military Academy. In 1918, his family took up residence in San Francisco, California, where he began his studies of law and accounting in 1919.

==AMORC==
Lewis formally joined AMORC in 1921. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1939, Lewis became the leader (imperator) and was duly elected.

In &quot;Fédération Universelle des Ordres et Sociétés Initiatiques&quot;, FUDOSI, he was known by the nomen mysticum (mystical name) Sar Validivar and received his initiation in Martinism during the second convention of FUDOSI in September 1936. In the same year, he was initiated as a Rose-Croix Order Kabalistique and in the Traditional Martinist Order in Europe. On August 2, 1939, he was elected by the Board of Directors of the Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC as Imperator of the order, a position he held until his Great Initiation on January 12, 1987.

In March 1940, Lewis was elected President of the International Supreme Council of the order Rosæ Crucis. Among the awards he received in his lifetime was the honorary degree of doctor of literature from Andhra University in India, and the star and the cross of science from the International Academic Council.

He founded the Grand Lodge of Brazil in the summer of 1956, and he commissioned new buildings for the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in 1966.

Lewis died January 12, 1987. He was succeeded by Gary L. Stewart.

== Personal life ==
On March 28, 1923, he married Gladys Natishna Hammer, who was known to all Rosicrucians as Soror Gladys Lewis.

<doc id="394839" wikidata="Q5116884" url="?curid=394839" title="Church of God Mountain Assembly">
<text>The Church of God, Mountain Assembly (CGMA) is a Holiness Pentecostal Christian body formed in 1907, with roots in the late 19th-century American holiness movement and early 20th-century Pentecostal revival. The denomination maintains headquarters in Jellico, Tennessee and is a member of the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (formerly the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America).

The main geographical strength of the body (about 65% of the churches) is in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. But, they are also in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Indiana, Montana, West Virginia, Alabama, Michigan, and Kansas. There were over 10,000 members in over 103 USA churches in 2018 and nearly 720 churches in 21 nations. The denomination&#x27;s World Missions Department serves foreign nations with children&#x27;s homes, schools, pastors, and churches.

==History==
In the late nineteenth century, several ministers of the South Union Baptist Association of United Baptists embraced the holiness movement. At its annual session in 1905, the South Union Association of United Baptists excluded all ministers preaching entire sanctification and the danger of apostasy. On August 24, 1907, representatives met at Ryan’s Creek church in Whitley County, Kentucky and formed a new association. They chose the name Church of God. The early leaders were Reverends J. H. Parks, Steve Bryant, and Allen Moses. Shortly after organization, they embraced Pentecostalism. After discovering that other bodies were holding property and transacting business under the name Church of God, this body added the words &quot;Mountain Assembly&quot; to &quot;Church of God&quot; for identification and legal purposes in 1911. In 1917 the body was incorporated, and in 1922 permanent headquarters were established in Jellico, Tennessee.

&quot;The Gospel Herald&quot;, official publication of the Church of God Mountain Assembly, was first published in 1942. A more episcopal form of government was adopted in 1944, that included the offices of General Overseer and General Secretary and Treasurer.

The Church of God Mountain Assembly has endured three divisions since its formation, resulting in the formation of the General Assembly Church of God (org. 1916 in McCreary County, Kentucky), Church of God of the Union Assembly (org. 1920 in Jackson County, Georgia) and the Church of God of the Original Mountain Assembly (org. 1946 at Williamsburg, Kentucky).

==Doctrine==
The church utilizes a Church Covenant, and holds a twelve article Statement of Faith. Doctrines of the &quot;Church of God Mountain Assembly&quot; include:
*the Bible as the inspired, infallible Word of God
*God in three distinct persons – Father, Son and Holy Ghost
*the deity, virgin birth, sinless life, sacrificial atonement, and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ
*salvation by faith through regeneration by the Holy Ghost
*sanctification as a second work of grace
*the full Gospel of the New Testament including divine healing and other gifts of the Spirit
*water baptism by immersion, The Lord&#x27;s Supper as Ordinances
*the pre-Millennial second coming of Christ
*In speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives them utterance and that it is the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost

<text>Harvey Spencer Lewis (November 25, 1883 – August 2, 1939), a Rosicrucian author, mystic and the founder of AMORC. He led AMORC as its first leader (imperator) from its creation in 1915 until his death.

==Early life==
Lewis was born November 25 1883 in Frenchtown, New Jersey. His parents were of Welsh and German ancestry. Lewis was an advertising agent.

== Esotericism ==
He had founded a group called the New York Institution for Psychical Research. In 1904 he founded the Rosicrucian Research Society. The Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross (AMORC) was founded in 1915. He founded the organization after a trip to France with his father, claiming that he had been initiated into Rosicrucianism and was given a mission to spread it there in what he called an &quot;old tower&quot; in Toulouse. He presented this as a revival of the original, partially mythical and ancient Rosicrucian Order. 

Lewis affiliated with many occult groups, especially Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Ordo Templi Orientis. Following a 1916 split in the O.T.O., the schismatic German branch recognized AMORC, giving him a document to prove this. He was proud of receiving this document, despite differences in belief between the two organizations (AMORC did not practice sex magic). While predominantly Rosicrucian, the works of Lewis also incorporate neo-Templar elements, having a particular interest in the 18th century revivalist order of Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat and the Knights Templar. Lewis had had some contact with neo-Templar figures and related European occultists, including Émile Dantinne.

Lewis was interested in Egyptology, and founded the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San Jose. It is located in Rosicrucian Park.

== Works ==
In 1931, Lewis, under the pen name Wishar S[penle] Cerve, wrote a book (published by the Rosicrucians) about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that a bibliographic note on Mount Shasta described as &quot;responsible for the legend&#x27;s widespread popularity.&quot; Lewis authored &quot;The Mystical Life of Jesus&quot; in 1929. The book is notable for defending a variant of the swoon hypothesis that Jesus survived his crucifixion. Lewis plagiarized entire chapters from &quot;The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ&quot; by Levi H. Dowling.

== Death ==
Lewis died in 1939. He was succeeded as leader of AMORC by his son, Ralph Maxwell Lewis.

<text>47 (forty-seven) is the natural number following 46 and preceding 48. It is a prime number.

It is the adopted favorite number of Pomona College, a liberal arts college in Southern California, whose alumni have added cultural references to it in numerous places, including many &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes.

==Mathematics==
47 is a safe prime, an isolated prime, a highly cototient number, an Eisenstein prime, and a Lucas number.

47 is also a supersingular prime. It is the last consecutive prime number that divides the order of at least one sporadic group.

==In popular culture==

===Pomona College===


===Other===
Late rapper Capital Steez was infatuated with the number 47 and what it meant spiritually. He believed the number 47 was the &quot;perfect expression of balance in the world&quot;, representing the tension between the heart and the brain (the fourth and seventh chakras, respectively.) The number featured on the cover of &quot;AmeriKKKan Korruption&quot;, stylized to resemble a swastika.

<text>Margaret Cochran Corbin (November 12, 1751January 16, 1800) was a woman who fought in the American Revolutionary War. On November 16, 1776, her husband, John Corbin, was one of 2800 American soldiers defending Fort Washington in northern Manhattan from 8,000 attacking Hessian troops under British command. Margaret was too nervous to let her husband go into battle alone, so she decided she wanted to go with him. Since she was a nurse, she was allowed to accompany her husband as a nurse for injured soldiers. John Corbin was on the crew of one of two cannons the defenders deployed; when he fell in action, Margaret Corbin took his place and continued to work the cannon until she too was seriously wounded. It is said that Corbin was standing next to her husband when he fell during battle. Immediately, she took his post, and because she had watched her husband, a trained artilleryman, fire the cannon so much, she was able to fire, clean and aim the cannon with great ease and speed. This impressed the other soldiers and was the beginning of her military career. She later became the first woman in U.S. history to receive a pension from Congress for military service when she could no longer work due to injury, and was enlisted into the Corps of Invalids.

==Early life==
Margaret Cochran was born in Western Pennsylvania on November 12, 1751, in what is now Franklin County. The surname Cochran is of Irish origin anglicized from maccogaráin or Ó Cogaráin. Her parents were Robert Cochran, an Irish immigrant and his wife, Sarah. In 1756, when Margaret was five years old, her parents were attacked by Native Americans. Her father was killed, and her mother was kidnapped, never to be seen again — Margaret and her brother, John, escaped the raid because they were not at home. Margaret lived with her uncle for the rest of her childhood.

In 1772, at the age of 21, Margaret married a Virginia farmer named John Corbin.

==American Revolutionary War==
When the war began, John enlisted in the First Company of Pennsylvania Artillery as a matross, an artilleryman who was one of the members of a cannon crew. As was common at the time for wives of soldiers, Margaret became a camp follower, accompanying John during his enlistment. She joined many other wives in cooking, washing, and caring for the wounded soldiers. She acquired the nickname &quot;Molly Pitcher&quot; (as did many other women who served in the war) by bringing water during fighting, both for thirsty soldiers and to cool overheated cannons.

On November 16, 1776, Fort Washington, where John&#x27;s company was part of the garrison left behind when General George Washington retreated with the Continental Army to White Plains, New York, was attacked by the British. John Corbin was in charge of firing a small cannon at the top of a ridge, today known as Bennett Park. During an assault by the Hessians, John was killed, leaving his cannon unmanned. Margaret had been with her husband on the battlefield the entire time, and, after witnessing his death, she immediately took his place at the cannon, continuing to fire until her arm, chest, and jaw were hit by enemy fire. The British ultimately won the Battle of Fort Washington, resulting in the surrender of Margaret and her comrades and the taking of the last American position in New York City. As the equivalent of a wounded soldier, Margaret was released by the British on parole.

===After the Battle of Fort Washington===


After the battle, Margaret went to Philadelphia, completely disabled from her wound, and never fully healed. Life was difficult for her because of her injury, and in 1779 she received aid from the government. On June 29, the Executive Council of Pennsylvania granted her $30 to cover her present needs, and passed her case on to Congress&#x27;s Board of War. On July 6, 1779, the Board, sympathetic to Margaret&#x27;s injuries and impressed with her service and bravery, granted her half the monthly pay of a soldier in the Continental Army and a new set of clothes or its equivalent in cash. With this act, Congress made Margaret the first woman in the United States to receive a military pension from Congress.

After Congress&#x27;s decision, Margaret was included on military rolls until the end of the war. She was enrolled in the Corps of Invalids, created by Congress for wounded soldiers. In 1781, the Corps of Invalids became part of the garrison at West Point, New York. She was discharged from the Continental Army in 1783. There is a historical marker near her monument at West Point.

==Later years==
Corbin received financial support from the government after the war, the first woman to do so. She died on January 16, 1800, at the age of 48, in Highland Falls, New York, where the local historical society erected a historical marker — to Captain Molly, in her honor.

==Legacy==
A memorial commemorating her heroism was erected in 1909 near the scene of her service on the C. K. G. Billings Estate, in what would later become New York City&#x27;s Fort Tryon Park. In addition, after the park was constructed, &quot;Margaret Corbin Circle&quot; lies just outside the main entrance, and &quot;Margaret Corbin Drive&quot; connects the circle through the park to the Henry Hudson Parkway. A plaque honoring Corbin, placed by the Chamber of Commerce of Washington Heights in 1982, is located on the eastern of the two stone plynths which mark the start of Margaret Corbin Drive. A large Art Deco mural depicting the Battle of Fort Washington scene decorates the lobby of a nearby apartment building at 720 Fort Washington Avenue. According to the New York Historical Association, Corbin was &quot;honored as no woman of the revolution has ever been honored before&quot;.

In 1926, The New York State Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) verified Margaret&#x27;s records and recognized her heroism and service to the United States through the papers of General Henry Knox. Remains believed to be hers were exhumed and re-interred with full military honors at the cemetery of the United States Military Academy at West Point behind the Old Cadet Chapel in the West Point Cemetery. The Margaret Corbin Monument was erected by the DAR at the gravesite. However, a 2017 archeological study revealed that the remains that had been moved were not those of Corbin, but rather an unknown male. The location of Corbin&#x27;s remains is unknown. Every year, the DAR presents the Margaret Cochran Corbin Award to a woman in military service.

In June 2021, the Manhattan Campus of the New York Harbor Health Care System of the 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs, located on East 23rd Street in the Kips Bay section of Manhattan, was renamed the Margaret Cochran Corbin Campus. It was the first such facility in the United States to be named after a woman veteran. A bill to rename the facility was introduced to Congress by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney; the bill was signed into law in January 2021.

<text>Royal Roads University (also referred to as RRU or Royal Roads) is a public university with its main campus in Colwood, British Columbia, Canada. The university is located at Hatley Park National Historic Site on Vancouver Island and is the successor to the Royal Roads Military College (RRMC), which was originally a training base for naval officers and later Canadian Air Force and Army personnel. After the end of the Cold War, the college was decommissioned, however, it was reinstituted following negotiations between the Department of National Defence and the Government of British Columbia by which the &quot;Royal Roads University Act&quot; was passed, leading to the establishment of Royal Roads University in June 1995. 

The campus covers approximately 260 hectares of leased property on the grounds of Hatley Castle, which was designed by architect Samuel Maclure in the early twentieth century for British Columbia politician and coal magnate James Dunsmuir and his family. Royal Roads is a small-scale university offering over 70 programs ranging from certificates and diplomas to undergraduate and graduate degrees. RRU currently has an enrolment of around 4,100 undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as a network of over 34,000 alumni from both the current university and the former military college.

==History==

The university&#x27;s main building, Hatley Castle, is a Scottish baronial style mansion that was completed in 1908 for James Dunsmuir, who was then the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia and previously the province&#x27;s Premier from 1900 to 1902. At the outbreak of World War II, plans were made for King George VI, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and their two daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, to reside in Canada. Hatley Castle was purchased by the federal government in 1940 for use as the King&#x27;s royal palace, but it was decided that having the Royal Family leave the UK at a time of war would be too big a blow to morale, and the family stayed in London.After the death of Dunsmuir and then his widow Laura, the family sold the estate to the federal government in 1940 to be used by the Canadian military. The facility was named and commissioned in December 1940 to train reserve officers for service in World War II. The institution went through several name changes before it eventually became Royal Roads Military College in 1968 (achieving full degree-granting status in 1975). The college&#x27;s name refers to an anchorage located in Juan de Fuca Strait between the city of Victoria, British Columbia and Alert Bay. 

Petty Officer First Class Gabby R. Bruner, Royal Roads bandmaster from 1979 to 1985, composed &quot;Hatley Park&quot; as the official quick march for RRMC and &quot;Dunsmuir Castle&quot; for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Royal Roads in 1983.

When the military college was decommissioned, many of the academic staff stayed on. The historic buildings of the military college, and the extensive gardens, which were part of the estate of the Dunsmuir&#x27;s, continue to be a centrepiece of the campus. Hatley Castle, the former residence of the Dunsmuir family, houses a small Canadian Military museum. In 1995, Hatley Park and former Royal Roads Military College was declared a National Historic Site of Canada to commemorate the Dunsmuir family (1908–1937) and RRMC (1940–1995). The site was designated with a plaque in 2000 as an example of a well-preserved Edwardian park with gardens.

In June 1995, Royal Roads University became a public degree-granting university. A replica of Horatio Nelson&#x27;s quote, &quot;Duty is the great business of a sea officer: All private considerations must give way to it however painful it is&quot;, which hung over the entrance to the Grant Building, was returned to Royal Roads University&#x27;s campus for Homecoming in 2011.

==Royal Roads University Museum==

The museum is located in the lower level of Hatley Castle, on the campus of the Royal Roads University and former campus of the Royal Roads Military College. The museum&#x27;s mandate is to collect, conserve, research, and display material relating to the history of the Royal Roads Military College, its former cadets and its site.

The Royal Roads Military College Museum is a member of the Canadian Museums Association and the Organization of Military Museums of Canada. The Royal Roads Museum is an accredited museum within the Canadian Forces Museum System. The museum has formed a cooperating association of friends of the museum to assist with projects. The museum is not open to the public.

==Academics==
Royal Roads University offers applied and professional programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate levels, focusing on graduate level career development, with some on-campus undergraduate programs being offered as full-time accelerated. General studies and continuing education classes are also offered for non-degree or diploma seeking students. The programs are generally flexible, modelled as a blended format that combines periodic in-person sessions with online courses. This format is designed to favour working professionals, who may complete the programs at a distance while maintaining their career and other personal commitments. The university offers three formats: i) on-site with 100% face-to-face learning, ii) blended, with part of the program taught in-person and the rest online; and iii) completely online or through correspondence. Residency-based programs range from one to three weeks, and are often held on campus, but select programs may host their residencies in unique locations around the world. Mature students are welcome, and assessments of prior experience are available for transfer credit in the relevant subject area. The Royal Roads University Student Association represents undergraduate students at the university. 

==Campus and grounds==
The campus and surrounding grounds of Royal Roads University are situated at Hatley Park National Historic Site in Colwood, British Columbia. Royal Roads leases the land from the Department of National Defence for $1 per year and assumes all stewardship responsibilities related to the site including the cost of site management, operations, the protection, preservation, and restoration of heritage assets, which include all buildings, gardens, and other historic and natural features on the site.





==Other buildings==
The grounds, a mix of landscaped gardens and natural woodland, still go by the name of Hatley Park that the Dunsmuir family gave their estate (although it is not a designated park). Hatley Castle and its surroundings have made appearances in numerous movies and TV series programs such as &quot;Smallville&quot; where it serves as the Luthor Mansion, and the second and third &quot;X-Men&quot; films where the university is transformed into Professor Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters.

Visitors to the Hatley Park can tour the extensive walking trails, as well as the Hatley Castle museum. The museum is free to enter, and contains historic, local memorabilia as well as a gift shop. Tours of the castle itself are available (schedule is seasonal) and access to the heritage gardens (approx 20 acres) have a visitor fee that helps offset the cost of preserving the site.

In a visit to the university in August 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated: &quot;There is surely no more beautiful campus in Canada than Lord Dunsmuir’s magnificent castle and the majestic forest and gardens of the Hatley Park National Historic Site. But beneath the Edwardian grandeur of Royal Roads lies a cutting-edge modern university&quot;.

During the life of the college, the HMCS Royal Roads Bell was displayed in the porte-cochere of Hatley Castle. After the closing of Royal Roads Military College, the HMCS Royal Roads Bell was kept in the Museum at CFB Esquimalt. It was officially repatriated on 10 Sep 2010 during the Royal Roads University 2010 Homecoming.

==Rankings==
Based on the 2011 National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), Royal Roads University was ranked as the 1st public institution for an active and collaborative learning experience and for level of academic challenge.

In 2008, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s Canadian University Report gave Royal Roads grades in particular categories along with 55 other universities. The grades are based on the Globe and Mail student satisfaction survey. Royal Roads was one of the 14 universities in the under 4000 students assessment pool and received a grade of B-.

=== Business school ranking ===
The BCom and MBA programs at Royal Roads were ranked by Corporate Knights Magazine in July 2007. The Royal Roads BCom program placed 28th out of the 47 BCom programs in Canada. The MBA placed 20th out of 35 MBA programs. In 2008, Corporate Knights Magazine dropped the Bcom ranking from 28th to 36th out of 47 BCom programs in the country. The MBA program dropped from 20th to 31st with the assessment pool for the ranking growing from 35 to 38 MBA programs. In 2009, Corporate Knights Magazine ranked the Bcom 25th overall out of 47 universities and 4th in the Small Sized Business School category. The MBA ranked 22 overall out of 35 universities and 4th in the Small Sized Business School category. Corporate Knights magazine bases its rankings on &quot;the integration of environmental and social issues into university and college programmes.&quot;

He has had minor roles in a number of films, including Bruce Lee&#x27;s uncompleted last film &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1972). During this time period (1964–75), he also taught physical education at Malaga Cove Intermediate School in Palos Verdes Estates, California. Dan was commissioned in 1977 by the Dallas Cowboys to incorporate martial arts into the team’s training.

The film &quot;I Am Bruce Lee&quot; provided Inosanto an opportunity to reveal a little-known fact about the friendship the two men shared. Inosanto was teacher to Bruce Lee, introducing him to nunchaku. Inosanto explained that he introduced the weapon to Lee, taught him the basics and some exercises to get him started on his weapons training. The &quot;Game of Death&quot; movie, one of the most recognizable of the Bruce Lee films, showcases the use of the nunchaku by Lee and Inosanto. He is featured as the &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Man of the Year&quot;.

Inosanto holds Instructor or black belt level ranks in several martial arts. He is known for promoting the Filipino Martial Arts. He is responsible for bringing several obscure forms of the South East Asia Martial Arts into the public eye such as Silat, a hybrid combative form existing in such countries as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. He has also been promoted to fifth degree black belt in the Machado family style of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He trained Shoot wrestling under Yorinaga Nakamura. Currently he is the vice-president of Lameco International, carrying on the Eskrima of the late Filipino martial artist Edgar Sulite. Inosanto has appeared on YouTube videos talking about training in Systema and appreciation for his teacher, Martin Wheeler.

<doc id="394867" wikidata="Q127878" url="?curid=394867" title="Khedive">
<text>Khedive ( ; ; ) was an honorific title of Classical Persian origin used for the sultans and grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire, but most famously for the viceroy of Egypt from 1805 to 1914.

It is attested in Persian poetry from the 10th century and was used as an Ottoman honorific from the 16th. It was borrowed into Ottoman Turkish directly from Persian. It was first used in Egypt, without official recognition, by Muhammad Ali Pasha, the ethnically Albanian governor of Ottoman Egypt and Turco-Egyptian Sudan from 1805 to 1848. The initially self-declared title was officially recognized by the Ottoman government in 1867 and used subsequently by Isma&#x27;il Pasha of Egypt and his dynastic successors until 1914. The term entered Arabic in Egypt in the 1850s.

==Etymology==
This title is recorded in English since 1867, borrowed from French , in turn from Ottoman Turkish , from Classical Persian (&quot;lord&quot;).

== Egypt in the 19th and early 20th centuries ==

=== Wilāyah (1805–1867) ===

Following the 1798 French invasion of Egypt and Napoleon&#x27;s defeat of Egyptian forces, which consisted largely of the ruling Mamluk military caste, the Ottoman Empire dispatched troops from Rumelia (the Balkan provinces of the Ottoman Empire) under the command of Muhammad Ali Pasha to restore the Empire&#x27;s authority in what had hitherto been an Ottoman province. However, upon the French defeat and departure, Muhammad Ali seized control of the country and declared himself ruler of Egypt, quickly consolidating an independent local powerbase. After repeated failed attempts to remove and kill him, in 1805, the Sublime Porte officially recognized Muhammad Ali as Pasha and Wāli (Governor) of Egypt. However, demonstrating his grander ambitions, he claimed for himself the higher title of Khedive, as did his successors, Abbas I, Sa&#x27;id I and Ibrahim Pasha.

=== Khedivate (1867–1914) ===

The Muhammad Ali dynasty&#x27;s use of the title Khedive was not sanctioned by the Ottoman Empire until 1867 when Sultan Abdülaziz officially recognized it as the title of Ismail Pasha. Moreover, the Porte accepted Ismail&#x27;s alteration of the royal line of succession to go from father to son, rather than brother to brother, as was the tradition in the Ottoman Empire, and Arab dynasties. In May 1879, the United Kingdom and France began pressuring the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II to depose Ismail Pasha, and this was done on June 26, 1879. The more pliable Tewfik Pasha, Ismail&#x27;s son, was made his successor as the new Khedive. Ismail Pasha left Egypt and initially went into exile to Naples, but was eventually permitted by Sultan Abdülhamid II to retire to his Palace of Emirgan on the Bosphorus in Constantinople. There he remained, more or less a state prisoner, until his death. He was later buried in Cairo.

After the nationalist Urabi Revolt of 1882, Britain invaded Egypt in support of Tewfik Pasha, and established an occupation over the country. During this period, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty under Tewfik Pasha and his son Abbas II continued to rule Egypt and Sudan using the title &quot;Khedive&quot;, whilst still under nominal (de jure) Ottoman sovereignty until 1914.

Abbas II of Egypt was deposed by the British in 1914, and Egypt was declared a protectorate of Britain, the Sultanate of Egypt, which was ruled by Abbas&#x27;s uncle Hussein Kamel under the title of Sultan.

<text>.info is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. The name is derived from &quot;information&quot;, although registration requirements do not prescribe any particular purpose.

The TLD &quot;info&quot; followed ICANN&#x27;s highly publicized announcement, in late 2000, of a phased release of seven new generic top-level domains. The event was the first addition of major gTLDs since the Domain Name System was developed in the 1980s. The seven new gTLDs, selected from over 180 proposals, were meant in part to take the pressure off the domain.

==History==
Domain &quot;info&quot; has been operated by Afilias since its creation. In 2003, it was the first gTLD domain to support IETF standards-based internationalized domain names. In 2001, Afilias CTO (Ram Mohan) discovered problems with the Universal Acceptance of the domain due to it being the first tld whose length was greater than two or three characters. 

The launching of &quot;info&quot; involved a &quot;Sunrise Period&quot; for trademark owners, followed by a &quot;landrush&quot; open to all, the first time such a process had ever been conducted for a new gTLD. This process received criticism for giving trademarks precedence over words that are generic in other contexts; for instance, the Caterpillar construction equipment company was able to register before feline enthusiasts were.

Although a large number of fraudulent registrations were initially made by registrants who did not actually own a valid trademark, a challenge procedure later weeded out most of these.

Prior to launch, the names of countries were reserved from registration at the request of ICANN, to the consternation of those who had paid pre-registration fees to attempt to register these names in the landrush. ICANN&#x27;s Governmental Advisory Committee, composed of country representatives from around the world applauded the move, the first by any major domain to protect the national interests of sovereign nations.

In November 2020, it was announced that Afilias was acquired by Donuts, the domain name registry operator. In 2022, Afilias and Donuts were merged and brought under a single company, Identity Digital.

==Usage==
Domain &quot;info&quot; has been the most successful of the seven new domain names, with over 5.2 million domain names in the registry as of April 2008. After the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York switched to the easier to remember mta.info website to lead users to latest information on schedules and route changes on the area&#x27;s transportation services. ICANN and Afilias have also sealed an agreement for country names to be reserved by ICANN under resolution 01.92.

&quot;Info&quot; is an unrestricted domain, meaning that anyone can obtain a second-level domain for any purpose, similar to the domains &quot;com&quot;, &quot;net&quot; and &quot;org&quot;. This is in contrast to TLDs such as &quot;edu&quot;, or &quot;coop&quot;. &quot;Info&quot; is the only top-level domain that was explicitly created and chartered for unrestricted use, although various other TLDs resulted in this situation &quot;de facto&quot;. &quot;Info&quot; stands for &quot;information&quot; in about 37 languages, and is a neutral name.

Afilias, the registry operator of both the &quot;info&quot; and &quot;aero&quot; top-level domains, has been aggressive in its marketing of the domain, with significant registrar incentives and outreach events.

<doc id="394871" wikidata="Q6610686" url="?curid=394871" title="List of colleges in Alberta">
<text>Colleges in Alberta may refer to several types of educational institutions. College in Canada most commonly refers to a career-oriented post-secondary institution that provides vocational education or education in applied arts, applied technology and applied science. These publicly funded institutions are known as comprehensive community colleges and polytechnic institutions and provide apprenticeships, certificates, and diploma programs. Comprehensive community colleges may also provide undergraduate programs in collaboration with a university, while polytechnic institutions may also provide select undergraduate programs approved by the provincial government.

In addition to publicly funded institutions, several privately funded post-secondary institutions also use the term &quot;college&quot; in their name. This includes private career colleges licensed by the province, faith-based institutions, and several other types of post-secondary institutions.

==Public institutions==
All publicly funded post-secondary institutions, including comprehensive community colleges, polytechnic institutions, and other institutions like the Banff Centre are governed under provincial legislation called the Post-secondary Learning Act. 

===Comprehensive community colleges===
Comprehensive community colleges are publicly funded post-secondary institutions with a focus on providing vocational skills in specific fields, as well as providing continuing education programs and academic upgrading needed for admission into other institutions (like universities in Alberta). These institutions may conduct research that supports economic and social development in their region.

These institutions provide certificate and diploma programs. These institutions may also provide apprenticeships for technical training programs and undergraduate programs in collaboration with a university. 

The following is a list of publicly funded comprehensive community colleges:
===Polytechnic institutions===
Polytechnic institutions are publicly funded post-secondary institutions with a focus on industry and vocational training, as well as technical programming. These institutions also provide programs for academic upgrading and continuing education programs. These institutions may conduct research and scholarly activities that align with the credentials they offer or are focused on strengthening economic development in the province.

These institutions provide apprenticeships, certificate, and diploma programs. These institutions may also provide select undergraduate programs approved by the provincial government.

The following is a list of publicly funded comprehensive community colleges:

===Other public institutions===
There is one publicly funded institution in Alberta with a specialized focus on the fine arts and culture, the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, based in Banff. As opposed to other publicly funded comprehensive community colleges and polytechnic institutions, the Banff Centre services the entire province. The Banff Centre provides certificate and diploma programs and is permitted to conduct research and scholarly activities that align with the credentials they offer.

==Private institutions==
===Private career college===
There are over 190 private career colleges based in Alberta that offer various career training and vocational programs. All private career colleges are licensed under the Provincial Vocational Training Act and its related regulations. 

Although these institutions are privately operated and financed, the provincial government monitors private career colleges by requiring them to submit annual reports on student graduation and job placement rates as well as through compliance reviews. A private career college&#x27;s licence can be revoked by the provincial government if graduation and job placement rates are below 70 per cent for four consecutive reporting periods.

===Faith-based institutions===
There are 12 faith-based institutions in Alberta. Many of these institutions are privately operated and funded, although some are affiliated with a public university in Alberta. These institutions offer bachelor of theology programs, and may also be approved to provide select degree programs by the provincial government.

The following is list of designated faith-based institutions based in Alberta:
===Other types of privately funded &quot;colleges&quot;===
In addition to private career colleges and faith-based institutions, there exist several post-secondary flight schools and language schools that also use the term &quot;college&quot; in their name. However, the majority of these institutions do not use the term in their name.

<doc id="394874" wikidata="Q4405432" url="?curid=394874" title="True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days">
<text>The True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (TLC) is a breakaway sect of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It is headquartered in Manti, Utah, United States, where as of 2004 it maintained a membership of 300 to 500 adherents. The church has a meetinghouse in Manti, and in the past also owned a building in Manti called the Red Brick Store, not to be confused with the Red Brick Store in Nauvoo, Illinois.

==Establishment==

The church was organized on May 3, 1994, in response to what was felt to be a general apostasy of the LDS Church. This apostasy included Brigham Young (and subsequent presidents of the LDS Church) scattering the LDS Church membership rather than gathering it; the discontinuation of plural marriage; changes to ordinances and temple-related doctrine; and an increasing trend of what TLC describes as &quot;watering-down&quot; doctrine.

The TLC began as a study group and Priesthood Council in the early 1990s, where people from both the LDS Church and Mormon fundamentalist churches met together to discuss doctrine. During this period, the leader of the study group, James Dee Harmston (born November 6, 1940; died June 27, 2013), served a mission to Nauvoo. Prior to his retirement and founding of the TLC, Harmston worked as a real estate developer and lobbyist for the Reagan Administration.

A manuscript called &quot;Further Light &amp; Knowledge&quot; dealing with research into the true order of prayer was published in 1990 by Ogden Kraut&#x27;s publishing house, Pioneer Press. Gary Barns likely authored the manuscript, but authorship is not completely clear because an undated manuscript by the same title, believed to be written by Harmston, has been circulated in various Mormon fundamentalist discussion groups. In 1994, Harmston claimed the ancient biblical patriarchs Enoch, Noah, Abraham and Moses laid their hands on his head and conferred upon him the keys of the Melchizedek priesthood. Harmston then organized the church and collected his revelations in the &quot;Manti Revelation Book&quot;. He formally organized a hierarchy consisting of a President of the High Priesthood (himself), a Presiding Patriarch, a First Presidency, and a Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

One investigative article in 1996 wrote of the TLC&#x27;s beginnings that:

Jim and Elaine Harmston &quot;donned their Mormon temple robes at home and created a makeshift altar from a pillow and piano bench topped by a white bed sheet. They knelt to utilize the &#x27;true order of prayer,&#x27; a ritual said to facilitate otherworldly communication ... They say God gave them the same answer He gave Smith (in the grove when asking what church to join) only this time He said the current church was among the &#x27;wrong&#x27; churches and they should start their own&quot;.

==TLC doctrines and teachings==
Soon after organizing the church, Harmston taught a number of semi-private seminars known as &quot;the Models,&quot; discussing the necessity of following early Mormon doctrines. Besides the doctrines of plural marriage and the law of consecration, the TLC also teaches &quot;multiple mortal probations,&quot; a form of reincarnation limited in scope to one&#x27;s own gender and species, i.e., human men are reincarnated as human men and human women as human women. This doctrine is considered false by the LDS Church and some Mormon fundamentalist groups. The TLC also teaches &quot;the gathering,&quot; a doctrine familiar to early Mormonism and referenced numerous times in Latter Day Saint scripture. &quot;The gathering&quot; is the idea that all the &quot;elect&quot; of Israel should gather together. To the TLC church, this gathering is thought to be primarily to Manti, but can be elsewhere in Sanpete County, Utah.

Harmston taught he was the reincarnation of Joseph Smith and that he had been ordained by Moses. He predicted a period of upheaval beginning before 2004, and began a survivalist community where he and 300 followers would stay during that period. They would be armed and would have food stored beforehand. Several former sect members sued Harmston, hoping to recover $250,000. Members of the sect were excommunicated by the LDS Church for &quot;undue preoccupation with Armageddon.&quot;

While proselytizing was heavily pursued during the infancy of the TLC, all missionary work ceased by March 2000. This was in part due to a revelation and promise by Harmston that Christ would appear on March 25, 2000, perform the ordinance of deliverance, and begin the terrestrial order (or, Millennium). This promise was conditional upon the faithfulness of the members, but when it was not fulfilled, some members felt Harmston had prophesied inaccurately. This precipitated the subsequent apostasy of several members of the First Presidency and Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Randy Maudsley, Jeff Hanks, Kent Braddy, Bart Malstrom and John Harper all either left or were excommunicated). The Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency were subsequently reorganized. One of the church&#x27;s better proselytizing tools, its website, shut down completely a short time later due to a revelation declaring that &quot;the day of the Gentile&quot; had ended, meaning preaching to non-members (gentiles) must cease. A CD-ROM version of the TLC website has continued to be mailed to persons interested in joining the TLC. While the TLC has decided to remain offline in regards to their public missionary work, discussion forums do exist with former members, and cached archives of TLC website material is available on the internet.

The end of &quot;the day of the Gentile&quot; is a reference to previous revelations, particularly in the Doctrine and Covenants, that the gospel of Jesus Christ would first go to the Gentiles and then to the Jews (&quot;the House of Israel&quot;). This policy, in addition to the above factors, discontinued the TLC&#x27;s policy of open missionary work or attempts at conversion. Those seriously seeking knowledge or membership have been directed at times to attend meetings or research doctrine and other information from the early Latter Day Saint movement.

While the TLC has claimed many early LDS Church doctrines as its own, it has been noted that the TLC itself has changed some of its doctrinal interpretation since its formation. The TLC teaches that only the perception of doctrine has changed, and the actual foundational material remains.

The TLC has a strong youth program heavily involved in Scouting, including the Venturing Scout program which allows participation of both young men and young women.

==Lawsuit==
In 1998, two disaffected members accused Harmston of fraud when they failed to see Jesus. In 2002, a court awarded them $300,000, but the award was later overturned. An appeals court in 2005 granted the two former members the right to a new trial. The settlement was later reduced to $60,000 due to the church&#x27;s financial hardship.

==Media coverage==

A twenty-minute audio documentary, &quot;Saints of the Last Days&quot;, aired on National Public Radio&#x27;s program &quot;This American Life&quot; in April 1996. It discussed the breakup of the study group that preceded the TLC, which occurred prior to the formal organization of the TLC. The TLC itself was heavily profiled in a 1999 A&amp;E Network documentary, &quot;Inside Polygamy&quot; (AAE #17685).

A book containing the accounts of two of Harmston&#x27;s wives (Pauline and Rachel Strong) was published in 2006. Numerous other anti-polygamy books include &quot;exposés&quot; of the TLC.

A 2007 documentary critical of Mormon fundamentalist groups, &quot;Lifting the Veil of Polygamy&quot;, included interviews with a former TLC member. In 2010, the anti-polygamy TV program &quot;Polygamy: What Love Is This?&quot; also aired an interview with a former TLC member.

Some ex-members (including one former member of the First Presidency) have maintained blogs with information about the church.

==Terminology and place within the Latter Day Saint movement==

The term &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot; appears to have been coined in the 1940s by LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen. While Mormon fundamentalists, including members of TLC, call themselves &quot;Mormon&quot;, the LDS Church considers the designation to apply only to its members and not to members of other sects of the Latter Day Saint movement. The LDS Church therefore claims that there is no such thing as a &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot;, nor that there are any &quot;Mormon sects&quot;. The LDS Church suggests that the correct term to describe these splinter groups is &quot;polygamist sects&quot;. The LDS Church has repeatedly emphasized that it is not affiliated with Mormon fundamentalists. If members of the LDS Church are found to be engaging in polygamy, they are excommunicated. The TLC does practice polygamy.

The TLC may also be distinguished from historical Mormon fundamentalism which traces priesthood lineage either through the 1886 Revelation (John W. Woolley line) or those who believe Benjamin F. Johnson&#x27;s claims (the LeBaron family line). The TLC does teach that the 1886 revelation is legitimate and believes that (as stated in the revelation) John Taylor met with Joseph Smith and Jesus Christ. It has not been made clear how it doctrinally understands the existence of a resurrected Joseph Smith, since James Harmston was believed to be his reincarnation.

The TLC is a re-restorationist movement in that it holds that the original keys passed down from Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, were lost through apostasy and a re-restoration was necessary.

Some doctrinal distinctions also exist between Mormon fundamentalism and TLC teachings. For example, while the TLC does offer the original endowment Joseph Smith restored, it is understood that a &quot;living endowment&quot;—or administration of keys not all at the same time, but possibly during separate sessions—is necessary for the living, while endowments for the dead are performed in the same manner as the mainstream LDS faith and some other Mormon faiths. The TLC also provides temple ordinances beyond those revealed to Joseph Smith prior to his martyrdom in 1844.

==Other TLC doctrines==

The TLC shares much doctrinal common ground with other new religious movements, including Edgar Cayce and The Summit Lighthouse.

The TLC teaches that the Word of Wisdom involves a raw food diet and has also incorporated some ideas from the &quot;Eat Right 4 Your Type&quot; books by Dr. Peter D&#x27;Adamo. Sugar, honey, and meat are forbidden.

Harmston gave up clothing with leather or other animal products, suggesting he may have adopted a vegan lifestyle. Whether or not the rest of the membership is living the same is the subject of speculation by some former members. In 2005, the President of the &quot;temporal church&quot; Dan Simmons changed from using sugar to using xylitol, but again the practice of other members is unclear.

At one time, the TLC had an &quot;endowment house&quot; in Fairview, Utah, but this was lost when the property owner (a member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency) left the TLC. They have continued to offer temple ordinances for the living and the dead without the Fairview endowment house, consistent with the threefold mission of the church, which includes &quot;redeem the dead&quot;. Historically in Mormonism, ordinances for living people could be performed in endowment houses whereas ordinances for the dead required a temple.

==Death of Harmston==
Harmston died of a heart attack Thursday, June 27, 2013, at Sanpete Valley Hospital. Harmston had a history of heart trouble, but his death was unexpected.

<text>.coop is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. It is intended for the use of cooperatives, their wholly owned subsidiaries, and other organizations that exist to promote or support cooperatives.

The TLD was proposed by the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) as a response to the announcement by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in late 2000 of a phased release of seven new generic top-level domains in an expansion of the Internet domain name space.

The proposal was backed by many cooperatives and similar trade groups around the world, including the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). The technical infrastructure for the TLD was developed by the worker cooperative Poptel in the United Kingdom and became operational on January 30, 2002.

The domain&#x27;s sponsoring organization is DotCooperation LLC (also known as dotCoop), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA). DotCooperation is responsible for the TLD operation, including the enforcement of registration requirements. In 2005, the Midcounties Co-operative assumed operation of the domain registry through a subsidiary unit (Midcounties Co-operative Domains). DynDNS was contracted as the sole DNS provider for the registry in 2006.

Active domain holders are automatically included in an online coop directory and registrants receive a periodic newsletter. Registrations are processed via accredited ICANN domain name registrars or their resellers.

 domains are in use around the world; however, many co-ops, as businesses in the global community, also maintain domain names in other generic or country code top-level domains to identify themselves both as a co-op and as a business.

<text>A research library is a library that contains an in-depth collection of material on one or several subjects. A research library will generally include an in-depth selection of materials on a particular topic or set of topics and contain primary sources as well as secondary sources. Research libraries are established to meet research needs and, as such, are stocked with authentic materials with quality content. Research libraries are typically attached to academic or research institutions that specialize in that topic and serve members of that institution. Large university libraries are considered research libraries, and often contain many specialized branch research libraries. The libraries provide research materials for students and staff of these organizations to use and can also publish and carry literature produced by these institutions and make them available to others. Research libraries could also be accessible to members of the public who wish to gain in-depth knowledge on that particular topic.

Research libraries face a unique challenge of making research materials accessible and available to patrons. They also need to ensure there are no copyright-related issues with their materials, ensure that as many materials as possible are open access, and ensure all their materials are reliably sourced.

Some specialized research libraries could include those affiliated to governmental organizations which may hold documents of historical, legal or political import, or music libraries which will have books and journals on music, as well as films and recordings for musicians to access.

Research libraries will generally have materials that are typically non-fiction and scholarly. These traditionally included books, periodicals, journals, newspapers, manuscripts and cassette tapes. With the advent of technology, this has evolved to include CDs, DVDs, Ebooks, audiobooks and online research catalogues. Research library collections are focused on one or more subjects or fields of study and the material available on those topics are typically more extensive and in-depth than that found in public lending libraries. Institutions such as universities may have multiple research libraries on campus, each dedicated to different faculties or subjects.

Research libraries may also publish their own scholarly research which is conducted by their librarians on their topics of choice.

==History==

Libraries first appeared in Southwest Asia more than 5,000 years ago as repositories to store written resources for retrieval, often written on materials like bamboo, clay, and later papyrus. The most durable of these materials was clay, and tablets made of clay are the most common artifacts retrieved from ancient library sites. Many great civilizations built libraries which contained knowledge and information that were accumulated over years, sometimes centuries, and from across regions.

The oldest known library in the world was excavated in Ebla in northern Syria. Excavation of the site of the ancient city began in 1964 and archeologists have since uncovered more than 20,000 clay tablets that documented the economic and cultural life of the city&#x27;s residents. Archives dating back to 3000 BC were also discovered in 1975. The library also contained scientific records and observations on topics such as zoology, mineralogy, and information on Ebla&#x27;s business and tax issues.

One of the greatest ancient libraries in the world was the Library of Ashurbanipal, which was founded in the 7th century BC in Niveah, near present-day Iraq, by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. The library contained around 30,000 cuneiform tablets written in multiple languages pertaining to scholarly texts, archival documents and religious materials along with some works of ancient literature. The king sent his scribes to other libraries in the region to record their contents to create a register of contents.

Probably the most renowned library in the ancient world was the Great Library of Alexandria, in Egypt. The library was part of the royal complex that included the research institution known as the Mouseion, and is believed to have been established during the reigns of Ptolemy I Soter (367–283 BC) and his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC). 
There are report that the library at its height had up to 400,000 scrolls, though there is uncertainty regarding the exact number and how many scrolls were original works, as some of these may have been copies. The works collected covered a wide range of topics including works by Homer, Herodotus, Plato, and Aristotle. The library drew scholars from across the world and led to Alexandria being known as a hub for knowledge and learning.

The US Library of Congress is one of the largest and most well-known research libraries in the world. It is the United States Congress&#x27; official research library and is the oldest federal cultural institution in the country, having been founded in 1800. It contains more than 170 million items that cover a wide range of subjects from across the world and in 470 different languages. The library has offices abroad through which it is able to acquire and maintain materials that are not easily available through traditional acquisition methods.

== Services ==
Research libraries can be either reference libraries, which do not lend their holdings, or lending libraries, which do lend all or some of their holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their material; most academic research libraries, at least in the U.S., now lend books, but not periodicals or other material. Books available in research libraries can include textbooks, journals and rare manuscripts. As the contents of research libraries are so focused, there can sometimes be a high demand for certain book titles. To ensure that as many patrons as possible can have access to the books they need, libraries have reserve collections, the books of which are only available for short-term loans. These loans can range from a few days to as short as a few hours. Patrons can also gain access to periodicals and journals that require paid subscriptions through their libraries which they can use to access primary research materials.

A research library is often connected to the services of the university related to scholarly communication, such as support for open access journals run by the institution and the operation of an institutional repository, as well as support for the usage of other institutions&#x27; repositories and open archives through discovery tools and academic search engines like BASE, CORE and Unpaywall.

Rare books and manuscripts are often very valuable and can sometimes be fragile. These are often not available for loan, and can only be accessed within the library and sometimes under the supervision of the librarian. Rare books are those that were printed before 1850 and of which very few copies still exist today. They are highly valuable for research purposes as they often form the basis of historical research. Having a rare book in a library&#x27;s collection is very prestigious and is often indicative of the library&#x27;s high standards for materials.

Libraries may also have archives of old photographs, films, musical scores and even artwork. They often also have archives of old newspapers and periodicals. Newspapers are often accessible through microfiche machines, which are used to view images of back issues of such publications. Research libraries also often provide patrons with basic technological equipment such as computers, scanners and printers to aid them in their work.

These libraries frequently collaborate with one another to share resources through inter-library loans. This enables each library to meet the needs of more patrons while keeping their costs down. Libraries may also collaborate to share the costs features such as licensing information sources. This is especially important today, with libraries being required to offer more services for their patrons with fewer resources.

=== Research librarians ===
Librarians at research libraries are responsible for curating the library&#x27;s collections. They identify the best books and resources by reading catalogues, publishers&#x27; announcements and book reviews, and acquire them for the libraries. These resources are often of high quality and are from trusted sources and publishers. They also catalogue and organize the books and resources, maintain and repair books as required. Librarians can also work with colleagues in other institutions to share resources and better the relationships between institutions.

Librarians who work in research libraries often have in-depth knowledge of the subjects that are the focus of the institutions in which they work. They are therefore able to answer more specific topical queries that patrons might have while also giving advice on the best resources to access for the necessary information. They conduct informational or reference interviews with patrons to ascertain what information they are looking for, and the purpose behind their research. This can help them to direct users to the appropriate databases or materials or in some cases obtaining these materials from external sources for them.

With the changing role of libraries, research librarians&#x27; roles have evolved to include more than just selecting and maintaining the library&#x27;s offerings and books, and helping patrons locate the items of their choice. Today, librarians must also be technologically savvy so they can teach users how to use the library&#x27;s electronic systems.

Many librarians conduct their own independent research on topics pertaining to a library&#x27;s field or on the topic of libraries themselves. When the library is affiliated with an academic institution, librarians may even have quotas on how much research they must complete and how many papers they should publish. Oftentimes, these librarians have to meet their quotas in order to be eligible for promotions or even tenure positions at the library. Librarians&#x27; research can help to improve the level of service offered by the staff of the institution by increasing their knowledge of the investigative process. The research conducted may also support the operations of the library.

Librarians also spearhead the digitization projects of any primary research sources that the library might have. These sources are typically the result of research projects conducted by the librarians affiliated with that institution. Digitization projects are often intensive and long-drawn. Librarians need to identify which materials should be digitized and the priority in which they should be digitized. They also need to ascertain what formats will be most suitable for the materials and the patrons, raise the necessary funds and obtain the rights to digitize the items. They then need to prepare the original documents, have them scanned or otherwise converted and ensure that all the necessary metadata is added. They then have to perform quality checks to ensure that the material is of the highest quality and fit to be released to the public.

=== Future prospects ===
With the rapid advancement of technology and the advent of the digital age, consumers expectations are changing and libraries are being required to improve their digital infrastructure. This phenomenon began in the early 2010s and has been accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic when many libraries across the world were physically closed forcing patrons to rely solely on their electronic offerings. Libraries have had to update their technological infrastructure in order to keep up with the new demands of the public.

The first step the average person takes when they conduct research is no longer visiting the library but searching for information online. Patrons will obtain a basic understanding of their topic and identify the books or materials they need before ever setting foot in a library. They can also identify which libraries will provide them the most convenient access to these materials through online archives and catalogues. This is what makes effective digitization projects in libraries and the maintenance of accurate online catalogues crucial for libraries&#x27; continued survival. Libraries may also have functions on their websites which enable patrons to email librarians with questions directly to obtain answers in a quick and efficient manner and also ensure that questions will be addressed by the most qualified party.

Libraries are now required to have extensive digital collections which comprise electronic journals, Ebooks and virtual reference services. They must also make their catalogues available online for users to quickly determine whether the library has the materials they need and when and how these materials will be available for their use. Many libraries also have interlinked systems that enable patrons to reserve and borrow books from affiliated libraries, effectively increasing their collection size while keeping costs down. This can make it possible for libraries to offer resources that have a narrow appeal and a low demand but that could still be useful for patrons to access.

Libraries are also required to be more efficient to meet both consumer demand and to keep up with continuing budget cuts. One benefit of increasing digitization is that it enables greater automation of workflows within libraries which ensures that they become more streamlined. These increased efficiencies ensure libraries and their librarians are able to provide the highest quality service possible.

<text>The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (abbreviated to FLDS Church or FLDS) is a Mormon fundamentalist group whose members practice polygamy. It is variously defined as a cult, a sect or a new religious movement. The FLDS Church has been involved in various illegal activities, including child marriages, child abandonment, sexual assault and human trafficking including child sexual abuse. The sect is not connected to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter-day Saint denomination.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) traces its claim to spiritual authority to when Brigham Young, then-president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), once visited the Short Creek Community and said, &quot;This will someday be the head and not the tail of the church. This will be the granaries of the Saints. This land will produce in abundance sufficient wheat to feed the people.&quot; 

In 1904, the LDS Church issued the Second Manifesto renouncing polygamy, and eventually excommunicated Mormons who continued to solemnize or enter into new plural marriages. Short Creek, located in what was then the Arizona Territory, soon became a gathering place for these Mormons. Members of the community believed a statement published in 1912 by Lorin C. Woolley, of a purported 1886 divine revelation to then-LDS Church President John Taylor, took precedence over the 1890 Manifesto, which had prohibited new plural marriages by LDS members. The community believed that in issuing the 1890 Manifesto, Wilford Woodruff sold his right to the Priesthood, thereby making Lorin&#x27;s father, John W. Woolley, his successor by the One Man doctrine. 

After being excommunicated by the LDS Church, some of the locally prominent men in Short Creek, including Lorin Woolley and John Y. Barlow, created the organization known as the Council of Friends. The Council, consisting of seven high priests that were said to be the governing priesthood body on Earth, was the governing ecclesiastical body over the Short Creek Community until being incorporated as the FLDS Church under Rulon Jeffs. In 1935, the LDS Church excommunicated the Mormon residents of Short Creek who refused to sign an oath renouncing polygamy. Following this, Barlow led those in Short Creek who were dedicated to preserving the practice of plural marriage. Consequently, Mormon fundamentalists that didn&#x27;t follow Barlow separated, leading to the creation of multiple fundamentalist organizations outside Short Creek by 1954. These included the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) and Kingston group through Joseph White Musser.

=== Postwar development and Short Creek raid ===
In the morning of July 26, 1953, 102 Arizona state police officers and National Guard soldiers raided the fundamentalist Mormon community of Short Creek, Arizona. They arrested the entire populace, including 236 children. Of those 236 children, 150 were not allowed to return to their parents for more than two years. Other parents never regained custody of their children.

The Short Creek raid was the largest mass arrest of polygamists in American history, and it received a great deal of press coverage. After the raid, polygamists continued to live there, and later the town was renamed Colorado City.

===From Leroy S. Johnson to Warren Jeffs===
John Y. Barlow claimed to be both head of temporal affairs and the Priesthood through his United Effort Plan. By 1984, a schism emerged in Short Creek when some took issue with his One Man authority. Those followers moved south of Colorado City to Centennial Park, Arizona and called themselves &quot;The Work of Jesus Christ&quot;, or &quot;Second Ward.&quot;

Leroy S. Johnson succeeded Barlow, and stress on the One Man Rule doctrine strengthened. Rulon Jeffs succeeded Leroy, incorporating Short Creek as the FLDS in 1984 to reorganize to an Episcopal polity reflecting the One Man authority.

With no clear succession, Warren Jeffs assumed leadership when Rulon Jeffs died. Winston Blackmore, who had been serving in Canada as the Bishop of Bountiful for the FLDS Church, was excommunicated by Jeffs in an apparent power struggle. This led to a split within the community in Bountiful, British Columbia, with an estimated 700 FLDS members leaving the church to follow Blackmore.

===Legal troubles, 2003–2006===

Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states of the United States as well as Canada and Mexico. Attempts to overturn the illegality based on right of religious freedom have been unsuccessful. In 2003, the church received increased attention from the state of Utah when police officer Rodney Holm, a member of the church, was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a 16- or 17-year-old and one count of bigamy for his marriage to and impregnation of plural wife Ruth Stubbs.[&quot;&quot;] The conviction was the first legal action against a member of the FLDS Church since the Short Creek raid.[&quot;&quot;]

In November 2003, church member David Allred purchased for YFZ Land LLC the Isaacs Ranch northeast of Eldorado, Texas, on Schleicher County Road 300 &quot;as a hunting retreat&quot;. The property would be known within the sect as Yearning For Zion Ranch, or YFZ Ranch. Allred sent 30 to 40 construction workers from Colorado City–Hildale to work on the property, which soon included three 3-story houses, each 8,000 to , a concrete plant, and a plowed field. After seeing FLDS Church critic Flora Jessop on the ABC television program &quot;Primetime Live&quot; on March 4, 2004, concerned Eldorado residents contacted Jessop. Jessop investigated, and on March 25, 2004, held a press conference in Eldorado confirming that the new neighbors were FLDS Church adherents. On May 18, 2004, Schleicher County Sheriff David Doran and his Chief Deputy visited Colorado City, and the FLDS Church officially acknowledged that the Schleicher County property would be a new base for the church. It was reported in the news media that the church had built a temple at the YFZ Ranch; this is supported by evidence including aerial photographs of a large stone structure (approximately wide) in a state of relative completion. A local newspaper, the &quot;Eldorado Success&quot;, reported that the temple foundation was dedicated by Warren Jeffs on January 1, 2005.

On January 10, 2004, Dan Barlow (the mayor of Colorado City) and about 20 other men were excommunicated from the church and stripped of their wives and children (who would be reassigned to other men), and expelled from town. The same day two teenage girls reportedly fled the town with the aid of Flora Jessop, who advocates for plural wives&#x27; escape from polygamy. The two girls, Fawn Broadbent and Fawn Holm, soon found themselves in a highly publicized dispute over their freedom and custody. Jessop sought help for the two Fawns from the Arizona Department of Child Protective Services, who assigned the girls to a foster home, but the girls fled when a judge barred them from contact with Jessop and their new address was given to their parents. Fawn Broadbent was allowed to move in with Carl Hohm, while Fawn Hohm remained in hiding. Fawn Hohm eventually moved in with a polygamist follower of Winston Blackmore.

In October 2004, Flora Jessop reported that David Allred purchased a parcel of land near Mancos, Colorado, (midway between Cortez and Durango) about the same time he bought the Schleicher County property. Allred told authorities the parcel was to be used as a hunting retreat.

In July 2005, eight men of the church were indicted for sexual contact with minors. All of them turned themselves in to police in Kingman, Arizona, within days.

On July 29, 2005, Brent W. Jeffs filed suit accusing three of his uncles, including Warren Jeffs, of sexually assaulting him when he was a child. The suit also named the FLDS Church as a defendant. On August 10, former FLDS Church member Shem Fischer, Dan Fischer&#x27;s brother, added the church and Warren Jeffs as defendants to a 2002 lawsuit claiming he was illegally fired because he no longer adhered to the faith. Fischer, who was a salesman for a wooden cabinetry business in Hildale, claimed church officials interfered with his relationship with his employer and blacklisted him. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the company and found that Fischer was not fired from his job, but quit instead. The district court ruling was overturned in part on the basis that Fischer was discriminated against on the basis of religion when he reapplied for his position and was denied employment because he had left the FLDS church. The parties eventually settled the case for an agreed payment of damages to Shem Fischer. 

In July 2005, six teenaged and young adult &quot;Lost Boys&quot; who claimed they were cast out of their homes on the Utah–Arizona border to reduce competition for wives, filed suit against the FLDS Church. &quot;The [boys] have been excommunicated pursuant to that policy and practice and have been cut off from family, friends, benefits, business and employment relationships, and purportedly condemned to eternal damnation&quot;, their suit read. &quot;They have become &#x27;lost boys&#x27; in the world outside the FLDS community.&quot;

On May 7, 2006, the FBI named Warren Jeffs to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He was captured on Interstate 15 on August 28, 2006, just north of Las Vegas, after a routine traffic stop.

The mayor of Colorado City, Terrill C. Johnson, was arrested on May 26, 2006, for eight fraudulent vehicle registration charges for registering his vehicles in a state in which he was not resident, which is a felony. He was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility in Hurricane, Utah, and was released after paying the $5,000 bail in cash.

===Leadership struggles, 2007–11===
On September 25, 2007, after trial by a jury in St. George, Utah, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape and was sentenced to ten years to life in prison. This conviction was later overturned, but he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years and fined $10,000 after being convicted on charges of aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault.

From 2007 to 2011, the leadership of the FLDS Church was unclear. On November 20, 2007, following Warren Jeffs&#x27;s conviction, attorneys for Jeffs released the following statement: &quot;Mr. Jeffs resigned as President of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Inc.&quot; The statement did not address his position as prophet of the church, but merely addressed his resignation from his fiduciary post as president of the corporation belonging to the FLDS Church.

According to a &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; telephone transcript, there is evidence that, when incarcerated, Warren Jeffs named William E. Jessop, a former first counselor, as his successor or, alternatively, that Jeffs had told Jessop on January 24, 2007, that he (Jeffs) had never been the rightful leader of the FLDS. Many press accounts suggested that Merril Jessop, who had been leading the Eldorado compound, was the de facto leader of the church. Additionally, on January 9, 2010, documents filed with the Utah Department of Commerce named Wendell L. Nielsen as the president of the sect. The FLDS incorporation charter does not require the church president to be the church&#x27;s prophet, but previous president Rulon Jeffs had also been prophet. In 2010, Willie Jessop, the church&#x27;s spokesman, refused to name the incumbent prophet &quot;out of fear there&#x27;d be retaliation by the government&quot;.

On January 28, 2011, Jeffs reasserted his leadership of the denomination, and Nielsen was removed as the church&#x27;s legal president. According to affidavits submitted by FLDS church leaders, Jeffs was acclaimed as leader at mass meetings of 4,000 church members in February and April 2011, and on April 10, 2011, a group of 2,000 male FLDS members voted unanimously to &quot;uphold and sustain&quot; Jeffs&#x27;s authority. By that time Willie Jessop had publicly broken with Jeffs, putting himself forward as a challenger for the leadership, but he was subsequently declared an apostate and left the church. A 2012 CNN documentary confirmed that Jeffs still led the church from prison.

===April 2008 raid===

In April 2008, acting on a call from an alleged teen victim of physical and sexual abuse at the FLDS compound in Schleicher County, Texas, Texas Child Protective Services and Department of Public Safety officers entered the compound to serve search and arrest warrants and carry out court orders designed to protect children. Over the course of several days, from April 3 through April 10, Texas CPS removed 439 children under age 18 from the church&#x27;s YFZ Ranch, while law enforcement, including Texas Rangers, executed their search and arrest warrants on the premises. The April 2008 events at the YFZ Ranch generated intense press coverage in the U.S., especially in the Southwest, and also garnered international attention.

On April 18, 2008, following a two-day hearing, Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st Judicial District Court ordered all of the FLDS children to remain in the temporary custody of Child Protective Services. Judge Walther&#x27;s ruling was subsequently reversed by the 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin, Texas in a ruling that Texas CPS was not justified in removing every child from the ranch. The 3rd Court of Appeals granted mandamus relief and ordered the trial court to vacate the portion of its order giving CPS temporary custody of the FLDS children. CPS petitioned the Texas Supreme Court requesting that the 3rd Court of Appeals&#x27; ruling be overturned, but the Texas Supreme Court, in a written opinion issued May 29, 2008, declined to overturn the ruling of the 3rd Court of Appeals.

The abuse hotline calls that prompted the raid are now believed to have been made by Rozita Swinton, a non-FLDS woman with no known connection to the FLDS community in Texas. Nevertheless, a court determined that the search warrants executed at the YFZ compound were legally issued and executed, and that the evidence seized could not be excluded on the grounds that the initial call may have been a hoax.

===Child sex assault convictions===
In November 2008, 12 FLDS men were charged with offenses related to alleged underage marriages conducted during the years since the sect built the YFZ Ranch. As of June 2010, six FLDS members had been convicted of felonies and received sentences ranging from seven to 75 years&#x27; imprisonment.

On November 5, 2009, a Schleicher County, Texas jury found Raymond Jessop, 38, guilty of sexual assault of a child. According to evidence admitted at trial, Jessop sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl to whom he had been &quot;spiritually married&quot; when the girl was 15 years old. The same jury sentenced Jessop to 10 years in prison and assessed a fine of $8,000.

On December 18, 2009, a Schleicher County, Texas jury found Allan Keate guilty of sexual assault of a child. Keate fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl. According to documents admitted at trial, Keate had also given three of his own daughters away in &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;celestial&quot; marriage, two of them at 15 and one at 14, to older men. The youngest of the three went to Warren Jeffs. Keate was sentenced to 33 years in prison. His conviction and sentence were later upheld on appeal.

On January 22, 2010, Michael George Emack pleaded no contest to sexual assault charges and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He married a 16-year-old girl at YFZ Ranch on August 5, 2004. She gave birth to a son less than a year later.

On March 17, 2010, a Tom Green County, Texas jury found Merril Leroy Jessop guilty of sexual assault of a child after deliberating for one hour. The court found that Jessop, 35, sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl while living at the FLDS Ranch in Schleicher County, Texas. The jury sentenced Jessop to 75 years in prison and assessed a $10,000 fine.

===April 2010 raid===
On April 6, 2010, Arizona officials executed search warrants at governmental offices of the towns of Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah. According to one report, the warrants involved the misuse of funds and caused the Hildale Public Safety Department to be shut down. According to another report, city personnel and volunteers were ordered out of the buildings while the search was being conducted, prompting protests from Colorado City Fire Chief Jake Barlow. Despite these protests, public safety did not appear to be affected, as the county law enforcement agencies involved routed calls for emergency service through the county offices. A search warrant was also executed at Jake Barlow&#x27;s residence.

The search warrant affidavit states that the Mohave County District Attorney sought records relating to personal charges on an agency credit card from the Colorado City Fire Department under the open records laws. Chief Barlow indicated that there were no personal charges, therefore there were no records to disclose. Records obtained by subpoena from the banks involved showed a series of purchases made by Chief Barlow and Darger that are questionable, including diapers, child&#x27;s clothing, and food, although the firefighters are not fed by the department. 

===After the raid===
In November 2012, the Texas Attorney General&#x27;s Office instituted legal proceedings to seize the FLDS ranch property in Eldorado, Texas. The basis for the forfeiture and seizure proceeding was cited as the use of FLDS property as &quot;...a rural location where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities&quot;, therefore, the property is contraband and subject to seizure. On April 17, 2014, Texas officials took physical possession of the property.

In 2012, Warren Jeffs published a volume titled &quot;Jesus Christ Message to All Nations&quot; containing various revelations, including one proclaiming his innocence and others serving as warnings to specific countries around the world.

In June 2014, the Arizona Office of the Attorney General filed a motion in U.S. District Court seeking to dissolve the local police forces and &quot;the disbandment of the Colorado City, Arizona/Hildale, Utah Marshal&#x27;s Office and the appointment of a federal monitor over municipal functions and services.&quot; As the basis for the legal proceeding, the Arizona Attorney General stated that &quot;[t]he disbandment of the Colorado City/Hildale Marshal&#x27;s Office is necessary and appropriate because this police department has operated for decades, and continues to operate, as the de facto law enforcement arm of the FLDS Church.&quot;

===Reconsolidation efforts since 2022===
Documents presented to the media and state prosecutors in 2022–23 indicate that Warren Jeffs issued a series of revelations from prison in 2022 reasserting his authority over the church and calling its members together. In one document from June 2022, Jeffs instructed that fathers seeking &quot;restoral&quot; should reunite with their wives and children, while warning that God &quot;cannot allow sin living to dwell&quot; in the church any longer; another, distributed in August, required that children be gathered back to the church over the next five years in preparation for the imminent end of the world.

A group of mothers who had left the church stated in April 2023 that a number of children cared for by former members had gone missing since the August 2022 revelation, and were likely to have rejoined the church. In June 2023, Heber Jeffs, a nephew of Warren Jeffs, was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation on a charge of custodial interference after abetting the disappearance of the daughter of a former member of the church in 2022 in accordance with the revelations of that year.

By 2023, investigators stated that the members of the FLDS Church had spread out to avoid the attention of authorities, some moving north into North Dakota, and were communicating regularly with Warren Jeffs over Zoom. Warren Jeffs&#x27;s son Helaman Jeffs had also emerged as a figure of authority within the church by this time. The revelations in 2022 were to be distributed by Helaman Jeffs, and he was also given the authority to perform polygamous marriages. Helaman is using a P.O. box in Ruso, North Dakota, close to a reported FLDS compound.

==Leaders==

===Previous heads===
As senior member of the Priesthood Council in Short Creek:
* John Y. Barlow (1935–1949)

As president of the FLDS Church:
* Rulon T. Jeffs (1986–2002)

===Current head===
Warren Jeffs became head of the FLDS Church in 2002. In the years immediately following Jeffs&#x27;s imprisonment in 2007, the leadership of the church was unclear. Other claimed leaders in this period include:
* William E. Jessop, 2007–2010, claimant to the succession
* Merril Jessop, 2007 – February 2011 de facto leader
* Wendell L. Nielsen, 2010 – January 28, 2011, president of the church&#x27;s corporate entity.
* Lyle Jeffs, brother of Warren Jeffs and former head and bishop of the church until his brother removed him from these posts in 2012, as reported by the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot;. In 2011, a former member of the church stated that Lyle Jeffs had been Warren Jeffs&#x27;s designated successor.
* Samuel R. Bateman, 2019–2023, claimant to the succession

In 2011, Warren Jeffs retook legal control of the church and purged 45 of its members.

Another FLDS member, Samuel R. Bateman, broke from Jeffs and declared himself prophet in 2019. Arrested in 2022 and charged with sexual abuse, he is recognized as prophet of the FLDS Church by some 50 followers .

===Bishops===
* James Oler – Canada

==Distinctive doctrines==
=== One Man Rule ===
In direct contrast to the structure of the Short Creek Community, the FLDS Church teaches that God only works through one man who has all Priesthood keys. In operation the President cannot be a member of the Priesthood Council. Rulon Jeffs , .

===Marriage and placement marriage===
The FLDS Church teaches the doctrine of plural marriage, which states that God commands in order for a man to receive the highest form of salvation to have a minimum of three wives. Connected with this doctrine is the patriarchal doctrine, the belief that wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands and placement marriage. The prophet elects to take wives from men as well as give wives to men according to their worthiness. This practice is also called the law of placing or placement marriage.

===Property ownership===

The land and houses formerly occupied by the FLDS Church on the Utah/Arizona border are owned by the United Effort Plan (UEP), established in 1942 as a subsidiary organization of the church. The UEP also owns most of the property of the businesses that were controlled by FLDS Church members in that area. The church viewed this &quot;United Order&quot; as a means of living the traditional Latter Day Saint doctrine of the &quot;Law of Consecration&quot;. In 2005, the UEP was seized by the state of Utah following a lawsuit by the Attorney General. The UEP was worth $100 million at this time. State control of the UEP ended in 2019, with the trust reformed into a &quot;religiously neutral&quot; entity benefiting the original donors and their heirs, including those who had left the FLDS Church.

=== Serpent seed ===
As an extension of the Adam-God teaching, it is taught that likewise there are literal children of Satan as there are literal children of God. Children of Satan were to be born with the Mark Of Cain as pay for his slaying of Abel in creation, and therefore justifying the Priesthood Ban. The seed of Cain survived the Flood through Ham&#x27;s wife so that Satan would be represented, but with a curse of bondage.

===Dress===
Men and women are forbidden to have any tattoos or body piercings. In general, women do not cut their hair short or wear makeup, trousers, or any skirt above the knees. Men wear plain clothing, usually long-sleeved collared shirt and full-length trousers. Women and girls usually wear pastel-colored homemade long-sleeved prairie dresses, with hems between ankle and mid-calf, along with long stockings or trousers underneath, usually keeping their hair coiffed.

==Criticism==

===Plural marriage===
At the time of his death, FLDS Church leader Rulon Jeffs was confirmed to have married 46 women and fathered more than 60 children. It was estimated in 2018 that Warren Jeffs might have at least 79 wives. Because the type of polygamy which is practiced is actually polygyny, the practice of it inevitably leads to bride shortages, and FLDS members are additionally known to practice child marriages, incest, and child abuse.

The FLDS Church members are known to violate laws when they practice polygamy. Former members of the FLDS Church, including Warren Jeffs&#x27; son Wendell Jeffson, have testified that its members including Warren Jeffs himself, regularly practice incest and child sexual abuse.

In 2015, Lyle Jeffs&#x27;s estranged wife Charlene Jeffs claimed in a custody dispute that the FLDS Church currently enforces a doctrine which only allows women to have sex with men who are members of the group appointed as &quot;seed bearers&quot;, defined as &quot;elect&quot; men of a &quot;worthy blood line chosen by the Priesthood to impregnate&quot; women. Under this doctrine, men no longer are allowed to have children with their wives. Charlene Jeffs wrote in her custody petition: &quot;It is the husband&#x27;s responsibility to hold the hands of their wives while the seed bearer &#x27;spreads his seed&#x27;. In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen seed bearer, or a couple of them, rape his wife or wives.&quot; She also described the &quot;Law of Sarah&quot;, in which FLDS women perform sex acts on each other in order to prepare for a sexual encounter with a man who is in the FLDS leadership. Lorin Holm, who claimed to have been part of Jeffs&#x27; &quot;inner circle&quot; before he was excommunicated from the group in 2011, later described the &quot;Law of Sarah&quot; practice in Jeffs&#x27;s community as being akin to a lesbian sex show with Jeffs participating and sermonizing. Holm also said that mothers who would not take part were sent away to &quot;redeem themselves&quot;, and their children were given to other women. This interpretation of the &quot;Law of Sarah&quot; differs from the &quot;Law of Sarah&quot; described in the 1843 polygamy revelation of Joseph Smith, in which Smith referred to the Law as a basis for consent to polygamous marriages by wives.

In 2022, FLDS Church leader Samuel Bateman was found to have 20 wives, which included underage girls, and, according to his family, also sought to marry his teenage daughter. According to criminal charges which were filed against him for destroying evidence linked to a federal investigation on sexual abuses, Bateman, who acted as the self-proclaimed &quot;prophet&quot; of a Colorado City-based splinter sect of the FLDS Church, used his position in the church to also sexually abuse 10 underage girls who he took as his wives in &quot;atonement&quot; ceremonies.

=== Sexual abuse of minors ===
The FLDS Church has been suspected of trafficking girls across state lines, and it has also been suspected of trafficking underage girls across the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, for the purpose of involuntary plural marriage and child sexual abuse. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also suspects that the FLDS Church trafficked more than 30 underage girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 so they could be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the activities of the FLDS Church: &quot;In essence, it&#x27;s human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.&quot; According to the &quot;Vancouver Sun,&quot; it is unclear whether Canada&#x27;s anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS Church&#x27;s pre-2005 activities, as it may not apply retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change.

===Welfare receipt===
FLDS Church leaders have encouraged their flock to take advantage of government assistance in the form of welfare and the WIC (woman-infant-child) programs. Since the government only recognizes one woman as the legal wife of a man, the rest of his wives are considered single mothers and as a result, they are eligible to receive government assistance. The more wives and children one has, the more welfare checks and food stamps one can receive. By 2003, for example, more than $6 million in public funds were being channeled into the community of Colorado City, Arizona. In his book &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; (p. 15), Jon Krakauer writes that, &quot;Fundamentalists call defrauding the government &#x27;bleeding the beast&#x27; and regard it as a virtuous act.&quot; Carolyn Campbell (&quot;Inside Polygamy in the &#x27;90s&quot;, 102) adds, &quot;The attitude of some polygamists is &#x27;the government is untrustworthy and corrupt, and I&#x27;m above it, but give me those food stamps and free medical care.

===Lost boys===
Former members have reported that the FLDS Church has excommunicated more than 400 teenage boys for offenses such as dating or listening to rock music. Some former members claim that the real motive for these excommunications is to ensure a sufficient female majority to allow for each male to marry three or more wives. In 2014, six men aged 18 to 22 filed a conspiracy lawsuit against Jeffs and Sam Barlow, a former Mohave County deputy sheriff and close associate of Jeffs, for the &quot;systematic excommunication&quot; of young men to reduce competition for wives.

The FLDS sect has kicked out boys as young as 15 years old.

===Racism===
In its Spring 2005 Intelligence Report, the Southern Poverty Law Center added the FLDS Church to its list of hate groups because of the church&#x27;s doctrines, which include its fierce condemnation of interracial relationships. Warren Jeffs has said, &quot;the black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth&quot;.

===Blood atonement===
Former FLDS Church member Robert Richter reported to the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; that Warren Jeffs has repeatedly alluded to the 19th-century teaching of &quot;blood atonement&quot; in church sermons. Under the doctrine of blood atonement, certain serious sins, such as murder, can only be atoned for by the sinner&#x27;s death.

===Birth defects===
The Colorado City/Hildale area has the world&#x27;s highest incidence of fumarase deficiency, an extremely rare genetic disease. Geneticists attribute this to the prevalence of cousin marriages between descendants of two of the town&#x27;s founders, Joseph Smith Jessop and John Yeates Barlow. It causes encephalopathy, severe intellectual disability, unusual facial features, brain malformation, and epileptic seizures.

===Child labor abuses===
On April 20, 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor assessed fines which totaled US$1.96 million against a group of FLDS Church members, including Lyle Jeffs, a brother of the church&#x27;s controversial leader, Warren Jeffs, for alleged child labour violations which were committed during the church&#x27;s 2012 pecan harvest at an orchard near Hurricane, Utah.

In April 2017, filings in U.S. District Court stated that Paragon Contractors, a company with ties to the FLDS Church, and Brian Jessop agreed to pay $200,000 in federal fines over the following year. These fines were levied against Paragon Contractors because it previously violated federal child labor laws. This settled a dispute with the U.S. Department of Labor hours before Paragon Contractors was due to face a potential contempt of court citation before a federal judge. The company was facing sanctions because in 2012, hundreds of children who were members of the Hildale-based FLDS Church were put to work harvesting pecans on a farm which was located in southern Utah under orders from FLDS Church leaders.

=== LDS Church&#x27;s attitude ===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has stated that &quot;the polygamists and polygamist organizations in parts of the Western United States and Canada have no affiliation whatsoever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, and it has also declared that polygamy is strictly prohibited by the current doctrine of the LDS Church. Additionally, the LDS Church states that the term &quot;Mormon&quot; is incorrectly applied to the FLDS adherents and it also discourages its own members from using the term &quot;Mormon&quot; as a descriptive term for members of the LDS Church themselves.

==In popular culture==

Popular media, including books and television programs, have focused on the FLDS Church.
* In 2011, the history of the FLDS Church was featured in &quot;Escaping Evil: My Life in a Cult&quot; on the Crime &amp; Investigation Network cable channel.
* In 2013 and 2014, the TV Channel TLC aired two reality television series named &quot;Breaking the Faith&quot; and &quot;Escaping the Prophet&quot;. Both center on members of the FLDS leaving the group and adjusting to the outside world.
* On June 28, 2014, Lifetime premiered a new movie called &quot;Outlaw Prophet: Warren Jeffs&quot; which stars Tony Goldwyn as Warren Jeffs. Lifetime has also made an original movie titled &quot;Escape from Polygamy&quot; (2013) which is inspired by the FLDS.
* In 2017 &quot;Evil Lives Here&quot; (Season 2 Episode 3 &#x27;My Brother, the Devil&#x27;) features Wallace Jeffs, half-brother to Warren Jeffs and nephew Brent Jeffs, revealing some of the horrors of the FLDS Church and the crimes of Warren Jeffs.
* On August 29, 2018, Great Big Story uploaded a short documentary-styled cinematic storytelling video titled &quot;She Escaped a Cult and Now Helps Others&quot; as part of its documentary series &quot;Defenders&quot; and follows Briell Decker, one of Warren Jeffs&#x27;s 79 former wives, in her journey to help others walk out of the terrors that she experienced when she was a member of the church. She started the Short Creek Dream Center with Director Jena Jones to help other ex-FLDS members embrace freedom in one of Warren Jeffs&#x27;s former homes through providing residents with counselling therapy sessions, meals, temporary lodging as well as future job preparations and arrangements.
* In 2022, Netflix premiered the documentary mini-series &quot;Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey&quot; which documents the rise and fall of Warren Jeffs, including testimony from investigators and escaped members of the church, and audio evidence from Warren Jeffs&#x27; trial for sexual assault of minors.

<text>Avar (, , &quot;language of the mountains&quot; or , , &quot;Avar language&quot;), also known as Avaric,&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-2/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-3/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a Northeast Caucasian language of the Avar–Andic subgroup that is spoken by Avars, primarily in Dagestan. In 2010, there were approximately one million speakers in Dagestan and elsewhere in Russia.

==Geographic distribution==
It is spoken mainly in the western and southern parts of the Russian Caucasus republic of Dagestan, and the Balaken, Zaqatala regions of north-western Azerbaijan. Some Avars live in other regions of Russia. There are also small communities of speakers living in the Russian republics of Chechnya and Kalmykia; in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Jordan, and the Marmara Sea region of Turkey. It is spoken by about 1,200,000 people worldwide. UNESCO classifies Avar as vulnerable to extinction.

==Status==
It is one of six literary languages of Dagestan, where it is spoken not only by the Avar, but also serves as the language of communication between different ethnic and linguistic groups.

==Dialects==

Glottolog lists 14 dialects of Avar, some of which correspond to the villages where they are spoken. The dialects are listed in alphabetical order based on their name in Glottolog:

* (Antsukh / &quot;Анцух&quot;) 
* Andalal-Gxdatl 
* Bacadin 
* Batlux 
* Hid 
* Karax 
* Kaxib 
* Keleb 
* Salatav 
* Shulanin 
* Untib 
* Xunzax (Khunzakh / &quot;Xунзах&quot;)
* Zakataly 
* Zaqatala

==Phonology==
There are competing analyses of the distinction transcribed in the table with the length sign . Length is part of the distinction, but so is articulatory strength, so they have been analyzed as fortis and lenis. The fortis affricates are long in the fricative part of the contour, e.g. (tss), not in the stop part as in geminate affricates in languages such as Japanese and Italian (tts). Laver (1994) analyzes e.g. as a two-segment affricate–fricative sequence [] ( = ).

Avar has five phonemic vowels: /a e i o u/.

===Lexical accent===
In Avar, accent is contrastive, free and mobile, independent of the number of syllables in the word. Changes in lexical accent placement indicate different semantic meaning and grammatical meanings of a word:
* ~ 

==Morphosyntax==

Avar is an agglutinative language, of SOV order.

Adverbs do not inflect, outside of inflection for noun class in some adverbs of place: e.g. the in &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;in front&quot;. Adverbs of place also distinguish locative, allative, and ablative forms suffixally, such as &quot;inside&quot;, &quot;to the inside&quot;, and &quot;from the inside&quot;. is an emphatic suffix taken by underived adjectives.

==Writing systems==

There were some attempts to write the Avar language in the Georgian alphabet as early as the 14th century. The use of the Perso-Arabic script for representing Avar in marginal glosses began in the 15th century. The use of Arabic, which is known as &quot;ajam&quot;, is still known today.

Peter von Uslar developed a Cyrillic-based alphabet, published in 1889, that also used some Georgian-based letters. Many of its letters have not been encoded in Unicode. The alphabet takes the following form: а б в г ӷ д е ж һ і ј к қ л м н о п ԛ р с ҫ т ҭ у х х̓ хّ ц ц̓ ꚑ ч ч̍ чّ /ч̓ ш ƞ ƞ̓ ɳّ ດ

As part of Soviet language re-education policies in 1928 the Ajam was replaced by a Latin alphabet, which in 1938 was in turn replaced by the current Cyrillic script. Essentially, it is the Russian alphabet plus one additional letter called &quot;palochka&quot; (&quot;stick&quot;, Ӏ). As that letter cannot be typed with common keyboard layouts, it is often replaced with a capital Latin letter i ( &quot;I&quot; ), small Latin letter L ( &quot;l&quot; ), or the numerical digit &quot;1&quot;.

=== Current orthography ===
The Avar language is usually written in the Cyrillic script. The letters of the alphabet are (with their pronunciation given below in IPA transcription):

===Arabic writing conventions===

One feature of Avar Arabic script is that similar to alphabets such as Uyghur and Kurdish, the script does not omit vowels and does not rely on diacritics to represent vowels when need be. Instead, modified letters with dot placement and accents have been standardized to represent vowels. Thus, Avar Arabic script is no longer an &quot;impure abjad&quot; unlike its parent systems (Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman), it now resembles a proper &quot;alphabet&quot;.

While this was not the case for most of the several centuries during which Arabic alphabet has been used for Avar, this has become the case in the latest and most common conventions. This was indeed not the case at the time of writing of a linguistic article for the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1881.

As an example, in Avar Arabic Script, four varieties of the letter &quot;yāʼ&quot; (&quot;ی&quot;) have been developed, each with a distinct function.

Nevertheless, Avar Arabic script does retain two diacritics.

First is &quot;shadda&quot; (ـّـ), used for gemination. While in Cyrillic, two back to back letters, including digraphs are written, in Arabic script, shadda is used.

Second diacritic in use in Avar Arabic script is ḍammah (ـُـ). In Arabic, Persian, and historically in Ottoman Turkish, this diacritic is used to represent [o] or [u]. But in Avar, this diacritic is used for labialization [◌ʷ] and not for any sort of vowel. So, it is the case that this diacritic is used in conjunction with a follow-up vowel. For example, the sound &quot;зва&quot; [zʷa] is written as &quot;زُا&quot;.

This diacritic can optionally be used in conjunction with shadda. For example, the sound &quot;ссвa&quot; [sʷːa] is written as &quot;سُّا&quot;.

If a word starts with a vowel, if it&#x27;s an [a] sound, it is written with &quot;alif&quot; &quot;ا&quot;. Otherwise, the vowel needs to be preceded by a &quot;vowel carrier&quot;, which is &quot;hamza-ya&quot;&#x27; (ئـ). No need for such a carrier in the middle of words. Below table demonstrates vowels in Avar Arabic Script.

===Sample comparison===
==Literature==
The literary language is based on the болмацӏ (&quot;bolmacʼ&quot;)—&quot;bo&quot; = &quot;army&quot; or &quot;country&quot;, and &quot;macʼ&quot; = &quot;language&quot;—the common language used between speakers of different dialects and languages. The &quot;bolmacʼ&quot; in turn was mainly derived from the dialect of Khunzakh, the capital and cultural centre of the Avar region, with some influence from the southern dialects. Nowadays the literary language is influencing the dialects, levelling out their differences.

The most famous figure of modern Avar literature is Rasul Gamzatov (died November 3, 2003), the People&#x27;s Poet of Dagestan. Translations of his works into Russian have gained him a wide audience all over the former Soviet Union.

<text>Louise Lanctôt (born March 24, 1947) is a Canadian convicted kidnapper and writer. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Lanctôt is a political activist for the cause of Quebec independence from Canada. Louise Lanctôt was an active member of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale political party that later merged with the Parti Québécois. She was also a member of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) and is the sister of convicted kidnapper Jacques Lanctôt, and was married to Jacques Cossette-Trudel who joined the FLQ with her.

During what became known as the October Crisis, as a member of the Liberation Cell, on October 5, 1970, Louise Lanctôt along with her brother Jacques Lanctôt, Yves Langlois, Nigel Hamer, and Marc Carbonneau put their plans into action. They carried out an armed abduction of James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner to Canada, from his Montreal home as part of their violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada.

On October 10, Chenier Cell leader Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose along with Bernard Lortie and Francis Simard, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec Vice Premier and Cabinet Minister Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, the goal of the FLQ was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

Lanctôt, with the help of her husband and other members of the &quot;Liberation Cell,&quot; held James Cross hostage, taking his photo and sending it to police with a list of demands that included money and the release of other convicts. They advised authorities that Cross would be executed and further threats to Cross&#x27; life were delivered to several radio stations along with their demands.

Early in December 1970, police discovered the location of Louise Lanctôt and her fellow kidnappers holding James Cross. His release was negotiated and on December 3, 1970, Lanctôt with her husband and child, plus the three other known members of her cell, were granted their request for safe passage to Cuba by the Government of Canada after approval by Castro. Although Lanctôt and her friends who wanted to go to Cuba were exiled from Canada for life, they were later found in France. For four years, Louise Lanctôt lived in La Courneuve in Île-de-France.

Over the years, all of the Front de libération du Québec members wanted to return to Canada and began secret negotiations through the reigning government Parti Québécois to achieve that goal. On October 13, 1977, Quebec Premier René Lévesque announced he was considering a request for a pardon for Louise Lanctôt and her husband. Eventually, the federal government consented. On her return to Montreal on December 13, she pleaded guilty at trial and was sentenced to two years in jail for her part in the kidnapping. She was freed on parole after serving eight months, following which she received Quebec government financial assistance (just as any other citizen is eligible for) to attend the Université du Québec à Montréal, where she received a degree in communications in 1982 and continued on to doctoral studies in human sciences.

Divorced from her husband, during the times when the Parti Québécois has been in government, she has been employed by numerous Quebec government-funded institutions, including as a researcher for the Collège de Maisonneuve, the Université du Québec à Montréal, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Université de Montréal health administration department, and the &quot;Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec&quot;.

The author of several books, Louise Lanctôt is a member of the Quebec Writers Union.

<text>The State University of New York at Purchase, commonly referred to as Purchase College or SUNY Purchase, is a public liberal arts college in Purchase, New York. Established in 1967 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller, SUNY Purchase is one of 13 comprehensive colleges in the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

==History==

The land that would become Purchase College was first settled by the Thomas family in 1734. John Thomas served as an assemblyman in colonial New York from 1743 to 1776. He served as a judge for the Court of Common Pleas in Westchester and a Muster-Master. Judge Thomas was an early supporter of American independence. Robert Bolton wrote in &quot;History of Westchester County&quot; that Thomas was &quot;a warm Whig&quot; who gave the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence in New York at the White Plains courthouse on July 11, 1776. On March 22, 1777, Thomas was imprisoned by the British and died on May 2, 1777.

John Thomas&#x27; sons, John Thomas, Jr. and Thomas Thomas, also fought for American independence. Thomas Thomas was later appointed a General. He is buried at the Thomas family graveyard, which is located behind the Neuberger Museum of Art on the campus of Purchase College. A tall, white stone obelisk commemorates General Thomas and his family.

In 2019, Thomas J. Schwarz announced that he was stepping down from his role as president after 18 years of service. State University of New York Board of Trustees has appointed Dennis Craig as interim president of Purchase College effective on August 1, 2019.
Milagros Peña was named the next President of Purchase College in May 2020.

In addition to advocating on the student body&#x27;s behalf, the PSGA runs the college&#x27;s Student Center, (known to the student body as &quot;The Stood&quot;), and most non-academic activities on campus, including numerous student-run services, and all clubs and organizations.

=== Clubs ===

Purchase College hosts a variety of clubs, organizations and services for its students to engage in their hobbies and interests with one another. As of spring 2018, Purchase boasts over 50 of these organizations, reflecting its on-campus diversity.

=== Events ===

In addition to its clubs, Purchase College holds several events throughout the year, accommodating the diverse musical and artistic interests of its student body. Most notably, these events include:
* Culture Shock: Culture Shock is an annual two-day music and carnival festival sponsored by the PSGA. Typically held in April, the weekend festival has featured dozens of renowned performers, including alumni students who have recently graduated from Purchase&#x27;s Music Conservatory. Some notable performers include: Iggy Azalea, Flatbush Zombies, MF Doom, Lil B, Ween, Jay Electronica, SZA, Dan Deacon, Regina Spektor, Deerhoof, Pissed Jeans, Animal Collective, GZA, Cat Power, Blonde Redhead, Bouncing Souls, Ghostface Killah, Ted Leo, Biz Markie, Kool Keith, Slick Rick, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Solange, Drake, Tycho, Beach Fossils, Dead Prez, The Front Bottoms, and Big Freedia.
* Fall Fest: An &quot;appetizer&quot; for Culture Shock, Fall Fest is the first of the two major music festivals at Purchase College, typically held in October. Like Culture Shock, Fall Fest features of number of bands and Purchase Music Conservatory Alumni.
* Zombie Prom: Zombie Prom is a prom-type event held annually in the spring that features live music, a DJ, and students dressed up as zombies.
* Student-run shows that take place in one of the two stages at The Stood: Whitson&#x27;s or Mainstage.

=== The Stood ===
The SUNY Purchase Student Center, which is known to the student body as simply &quot;The Stood&quot; was created on January 26, 2003 by Offer Ben-Arie as a recreation hall for students. Before its inception, the building which houses The Stood was a warehouse called the Butler Building. The Stood serves as a space on campus for students to express themselves outside of a school setting. The Stood is a fully equipped music venue, hosting many of the college&#x27;s larger events such as: Fall Fest, Zombie Prom, SK80s, Afrodisiac, Stood-o-ween, and sometimes Culture Shock. These events usually take place on the larger of the two stages inside of The Stood, typically known as Mainstage, which has a capacity of 900. Smaller, more underground shows happen in The Stood&#x27;s other performance room, Whitson&#x27;s Memorial Greeting Hall, which is more commonly known as just &quot;Whitson&#x27;s&quot; and has a capacity of 250. Students can book this room to play their own shows. Curated events sometimes happen in Whitson&#x27;s, featuring larger, non-student acts. Some notable people and artists who have played in Whitson&#x27;s are: Mitski, Princess Nokia, and Crumb. These events are typical to what you would see at a smaller venue in New York City, and are always free. The building is student-run and student-funded by the Mandatory Student Activity Fee.

=== Greek Life ===
Purchase College does not officially recognize fraternities or sororities on its campus, and the student body has a traditional disdain for such organizations. However, upon request, the college will allow such organizations to use space on campus, as available, to the same extent it provides space to other student organizations.

==Campus==
Purchase College is located on approximately in Westchester County, New York on the former Strathglass farm. The property was originally owned by Thomas Thomas, an American Revolutionary War soldier, whose family-and-servant cemetery remains on the campus between the south end of the Humanities and Visual Arts buildings. The college is adjacent to the Westchester County Airport, and is across the street from PepsiCo&#x27;s corporate headquarters.

==Dormitories and housing==

Purchase college consists of six dormitory halls, Crossroads, Central (formerly Big Haus), Farside, Outback, Fort Awesome, and Wayback; along with three apartment complexes, The Olde, The Commons (The Neu), and Alumni Village. Crossroads, Farside, and parts of Central house first year students and the staff in the building, one professional Residence Coordinator (RC) and two Residence Assistants (RA&#x27;s) per floor, are accommodated towards offering first year students help. The other parts of Central along with Outback, Fort Awesome, Wayback, and the apartment complexes are upperclassmen housing and the selection process of these buildings are determined by the amount of credits one has. Outback residence hall is also a part of the wellness program housing the school provides which according to its page on the Purchase website &quot;houses students committed to holistic health and wellness. Staff and residents develop programs that focus specifically on areas of Wellness including Physical, Intellectual, Vocational/Occupational, Emotional, Social (Cultural, Societal, Family, Community), Environmental and Spiritual.&quot;

In the fall of 2016, some apartments in the Commons K street apartment block caught fire during cooking activities. No students were hurt and most were able to return to their apartments, but others were housed at the neighboring Manhattanville College until replacement housing was available for them on campus.

==Architecture==
The college&#x27;s master architectural plan was created by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes and reflected the belief that &quot;modern architecture might be able to reshape the world.&quot; It has been described as a &quot;period piece of the 1960s&quot; and the architects who designed and built the campus include Philip Johnson and John Burgee, Paul Rudolph, Venturi &amp; Rauch, Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Henderson, The Architects Collaborative, Giovanni Pasanella, and Gunnar Birkerts. The campus&#x27; original buildings were placed close together to allow the surrounding fields to remain open. The college grounds are also home to many sculptures.

==Campus sustainability==
The college consistently ranks as one of the top sustainable colleges in the nation having ranked 72nd by the Sierra Club&#x27;s America&#x27;s greenest colleges. This ranking factors in the college&#x27;s energy use, waste, water, food, and purchasing policies. The college is also included in the 2014 Princeton Review Guide to Green Colleges.

In 2014, the college unveiled the &quot;Rocket&quot; composting system, which has the capacity to handle 460 gallons of food waste every week.

<text>Donna Reed (born Donna Belle Mullenger; January 27, 1921 – January 14, 1986) was an American actress. Her career spanned more than 40 years, with performances in more than 40 films. She is well known for her portrayal of Mary Hatch Bailey in Frank Capra&#x27;s fantasy holiday film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946). Reed won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s war drama film &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953).

Reed is also known for her work in television, notably as Donna Stone, a middle-class American mother and housewife in the sitcom &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; (1958–1966) whose character was more assertive and complex than most other television mothers of the era. She received numerous Emmy Award nominations for this role and the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Star in 1963. Later in her career, Reed replaced Barbara Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie Ewing Farlow in the 1984–1985 season of the television melodrama &quot;Dallas;&quot; she successfully sued the production company for breach of contract when she was abruptly fired upon Bel Geddes&#x27; decision to return to the show.

== Early life ==
Reed was born Donna Belle Mullenger on January 27, 1921, on a farm near Denison, Iowa, the daughter of Hazel Jane (née Shives) and William Richard Mullenger. The eldest of five children, she was raised as a Methodist. She had two brothers, William Lee (1927–1993), and Keith Mullenger, and two sisters, Lavone “Heidi” Flynn (1924–2019) and Karen Moreland (born 1942). In 1936, while she was a sophomore at Denison (Iowa) High School, her chemistry teacher gave her the book &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;. The book is said to have greatly influenced her life. Upon reading it she won the lead in the school play, was voted Campus Queen and was in the top 10 of the 1938 graduating class.

After graduating from Denison High School, Reed planned to become a teacher but was unable to pay for college. She moved to California to attend Los Angeles City College on her aunt&#x27;s advice. While attending college, she performed in various stage productions, although she had no plans to become an actress. After receiving several offers to screen test for studios, Reed eventually signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; however, she insisted on finishing her education first. She completed her associate degree, then signed with an agent.

== Career ==
===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===

In 1941, after signing with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Reed made her film debut in &quot;The Get-Away&quot; opposite Robert Sterling; she was then billed as Donna Adams.

MGM soon changed her name to Donna Reed because there was anti-German feelings during World War II. &quot;A studio publicist hung the name on me, and I never did like it&quot;, Reed once said. &quot;I hear &#x27;Donna Reed&#x27; and I think of a tall, chic, austere blonde that isn&#x27;t me. &#x27;Donna Reed&#x27; – it has a cold, forbidding sound.&quot;

Reed had a supporting role in &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941) and in Wallace Beery&#x27;s &quot;The Bugle Sounds&quot; (1942). Like many starlets at MGM, she played opposite Mickey Rooney in an Andy Hardy film, in her case the hugely popular &quot;The Courtship of Andy Hardy&quot; (1942). She was second billed in a children&#x27;s film, &quot;Mokey&quot; (1942). Reed starred in &quot;Calling Dr. Gillespie&quot; (1942) and &quot;Apache Trail&quot; (1942), then did a thriller with Edward Arnold, &quot;Eyes in the Night&quot; (1942), directed by Fred Zinnemann.

Reed appeared in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1943) with Mickey Rooney, &quot;Dr. Gillespie&#x27;s Criminal Case&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Man from Down Under&quot; (1943). She was one of many MGM stars to make cameos in &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943). Her &quot;girl-next-door&quot; good looks and warm onstage personality made her a popular pin-up for many GIs during World War II and she personally answered letters from many GIs serving overseas. Reed starred in &quot;See Here, Private Hargrove&quot; (1944) and &quot;Gentle Annie&quot; (1945), a Western. She was in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1945) and played a nurse in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; (1945), opposite John Wayne. MGM was very enthusiastic about Reed&#x27;s prospects at this time.

Reed collaborated with her Denison High school chemistry teacher Edward R. Tompkins (who worked on the Manhattan Project) on the 1947 MGM film &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot;, which dealt with the history and concerns of the atom bomb. Reed helped provide the story but did not appear in the final film. Reed was top billed in a romantic comedy &quot;Faithful in My Fashion&quot; (1946) with Tom Drake, which lost money.

MGM lent Reed to RKO for the role of Mary Bailey in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life.&quot; The film has since been named as one of the 100 best American films ever made by the American Film Institute and is regularly aired on television during the Christmas season. Reed later said it was &quot;the most difficult film I ever did. No director ever demanded as much of me.&quot;

Back at MGM, she appeared in &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; (1947) with Lana Turner and Van Heflin, a financial hit.

Paramount borrowed Reed for two films with Alan Ladd, &quot;Beyond Glory&quot; (1948), where she replaced Joan Caulfield at the last minute, and &quot;Chicago Deadline&quot; (1949). In 1949, Reed expressed a desire for better roles.

===Columbia===

In June 1950 Reed signed a contract with Columbia Studios. She appeared in two films which teamed her with John Derek, &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Hero&quot; (1951) and &quot;Scandal Sheet&quot; (1952). She had a cameo in &quot;Rainbow &#x27;Round My Shoulder&quot; (1952).

Reed was the love interest of Randolph Scott in &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Knot&quot; (1952), then was borrowed by Warner Bros for &quot;Trouble Along the Way&quot; (1953) with Wayne. She was loaned out to play John Payne&#x27;s love interest in Edward Small&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Seven Seas&quot; (1953).

Reed played the role of Alma &quot;Lorene&quot; Burke, girlfriend of Montgomery Clift&#x27;s character, in the World War II drama &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953). The role earned Reed an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1953.

The qualities of her parts did not seem to improve: she was the love interest in &quot;The Caddy&quot; (1953) with Martin and Lewis at Paramount; &quot;Gun Fury&quot; (1953) with Rock Hudson; &quot;Three Hours to Kill&quot; (1954) with Dana Andrews; and &quot;They Rode West&quot; (1954) with Robert Francis. Reed returned to MGM to act in &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; (1954).

Reed began guest starring on television shows such as &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Tales of Hans Anderson&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and &quot;Suspicion&quot;.

She continued to appear in features, usually as the love interest, in &quot;The Far Horizons&quot; (1955) at Pine-Thomas Productions with Fred MacMurray and Charlton Heston as Lewis and Clark, playing Native American Sacagawea; &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; (1956) with Steve Allen at Universal, playing Goodman&#x27;s wife; &quot;Ransom!&quot; (1956) at MGM as Glenn Ford&#x27;s wife; &quot;Backlash&quot; (1956), a Western at Universal with Richard Widmark; &quot;Beyond Mombasa&quot; (1957), shot in Kenya with Cornel Wilde, during which she was injured while making the film; and &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; (1958), shot in England with Stewart Granger for Romulus Pictures.

=== &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; ===
From 1958 to 1966, Reed starred in &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, a television series produced by her then-husband, Tony Owen. The show featured her as Donna Stone, the wife of pediatrician Alex Stone (Carl Betz) and mother of Jeff (Paul Petersen) and Mary Stone (Shelley Fabares). Reed was attracted to the idea of being in a comedy, something with which she did not have much experience. She also liked playing a wife.

The show ran for eight seasons on ABC. Reed won a Golden Globe Award and earned four Emmy Award nominations for her work on the series.

Reed described her show as &quot;[...] a realistic picture of small-town life with an often humorous twist. Our plots revolve around the most important thing in America—a loving family.&quot; In the show, Reed&#x27;s character, Donna Stone, is a loving mother and wife, but also a strong, smart woman with feelings and a sense of humor.

However, some feminists criticized the show, asserting that it promoted submissiveness among housewives. In a 1979 interview, Reed, who had raised four children, responded, &quot;I played a strong woman who could manage her family. That was offensive to a lot of people.&quot;

In a 1984 television interview, Reed said of her show, &quot;I felt that I was making, for women, a statement. This mother was not stupid. She wasn&#x27;t domineering, but she was bright and I thought rather forward-thinking, &quot;happily&quot; married.&quot;

In a 2008 interview, Paul Petersen, who portrayed her son Jeff Stone in the series, also shared his opinions about the production&#x27;s significance:
That&#x27;s what the show was really about, the importance of family. That&#x27;s where life&#x27;s lessons are transmitted, generation to generation. There&#x27;s a certain way in which these are transmitted, with love and affection...[&quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;] depicts a better time and place. It has a sort of level of intelligence and professionalism that is sadly lacking in current entertainment products. The messages it sent out were positive and uplifting. The folks you saw were likable, the family was fun, the situations were familiar to people. It provided 22-and-a-half-minutes of moral instruction and advice on how to deal with the little dilemmas of life.

===Later career===

When &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; ended its run in 1966, Reed took time off from acting to concentrate on raising her children and engaging in political activism. She returned to acting in the late &#x27;70s, appearing in the TV movies &quot;The Best Place to Be&quot; (1979) and &quot;Deadly Lessons&quot; (1983) and a guest stint on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

In the 1984–85 season of the TV series &quot;Dallas&quot;, Reed replaced Barbara Bel Geddes, who left the show due to illness, as Miss Ellie Ewing. Of the show, Reed explained in a 1984 interview,
One of the &quot;main&quot; reasons &quot;Dallas&quot; is successful is the family. They all stick together. They may squabble, but they pull for one another and live under one roof, which is really tribal, and it&#x27;s not true anymore! And I think deep down, everyone misses that.After Bel Geddes recovered and unexpectedly expressed a desire to return to the role for the 1985–86 season, Reed was abruptly fired. She sued in an attempt to stop the production of &quot;Dallas&quot; while she negotiated to be reinstated as Miss Ellie. Reed then sued for breach of contract, later settling out of court for over $1 million.

== Personal life ==
From 1943 to 1945, Reed was married to make-up artist William Tuttle. After they divorced in 1945 she married producer Tony Owen. They raised four children together: Penny Jane (born 1945), Anthony (born 1946), Timothy (born 1949), and Mary Anne (born 1957) (the two older children were adopted). After 26 years of marriage, Reed and Owen divorced in 1971.

Three years later, Reed married Grover W. Asmus, a retired United States Army colonel. They remained married until her death in 1986.

=== Political views ===
Reed, who was a registered Republican, became interested in politics in particular during the Vietnam War when she became concerned that her adopted son, Tony, might be drafted. In 1967, Reed became a peace activist and co-chaired the anti-war advocacy group, Another Mother for Peace. The group&#x27;s slogan was &quot;War is not healthy for children and other living things.&quot; In a 1971 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Reed said,

In the beginning, we felt [Tony] should serve his country in a noncombatant role. But he wouldn&#x27;t even accept that, feeling the whole thing was immoral. He didn&#x27;t trust the government or the military. I&#x27;ve learned a lot from Tony.
Reed supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

In addition to opposing the Vietnam War, Reed also opposed nuclear power plants. She supported Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy from Minnesota, a strong anti-war advocate, in the 1968 presidential election.

== Death ==

Reed died on January 14, 1986, at age 64, of pancreatic cancer in Beverly Hills, California. She had been diagnosed with the illness three months earlier and was told it was at a terminal stage. Her remains are interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

== Legacy ==
In 1987, Grover Asmus (Reed&#x27;s widower), actresses Shelley Fabares and Norma Connolly, and numerous friends, associates, and family members created the Donna Reed Foundation for the Performing Arts. Based in Reed&#x27;s hometown of Denison, the non-profit organization grants scholarships for performing arts students, runs an annual festival of performing arts workshops, and operates the Donna Reed Center for the Performing Arts.

Denison hosts an annual Donna Reed Festival. Reed&#x27;s childhood home was located on Donna Reed Drive in Denison but was destroyed by a fire in 1983. Reed bequeathed her Academy Award to her hometown, and it is on display at the W. A. McHenry Museum in Denison.

In May 2010, Turner Classic Movies honored Reed as their star of the month which saw Mary Owen pay a special tribute to her mother.

In a 2011 article, actress Shelley Fabares (who played Mary Stone on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;) wrote,
[Donna Reed] definitely became my second mother. She was a role model and remains so to this day. I still periodically hear her voice in my head when I am making a decision about doing something, I hear her urging me on to make the stronger decision of the two. I just adored her.Fabares also described Reed as &quot;a real Iowa girl. There is a bedrock decency to people in the Midwest. They are thoughtful and ready to help you if something needs to be done. She never lost that Midwest girl.&quot;

The state of Iowa announced Donna Reed Day on January 27, 2021, marking the 100th anniversary of her birth.

<text>The Pancharatna kritis (transliterated as Pañcaratna kṛti) (Sanskrit: &quot;pancha&quot; &quot;five&quot; + &quot;ratna&quot; &quot;gems&quot;) are a set of five &quot;kritis&quot; (songs) in Carnatic classical music, composed by the 18th-century Indian composer Tyagaraja. The first &quot;kriti&quot; is penned in Sanskrit while the other four &quot;kritis&quot; are penned in Telugu. The songs are: &quot;Jagadananda karaka&quot;, &quot;Dudukugala Nanne&quot;, &quot;Sadhinchene&quot;, &quot;Kanakana Ruchira&quot; and &quot;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&quot;.

==Tyagaraja and the Pancharatna Kritis==
Tyagaraja lived in the late 18th century and early 19th century in Tiruvaiyaru in present-day Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu. His compositions are considered to be some of the finest in Carnatic music. Of the five &quot;Pancharatna Kritis&quot;, four are in Telugu and one in Sanskrit. They are set to music in five ragas: Nata, Gaula, Arabhi, Varali and Sri.

==Composition==
The &quot;Pancharatna kritis&quot; were written in praise of the Hindu deity Rama. They are set to &quot;Adi Tala&quot; and each raga represents the mood of the song and the meaning of its lyrics. All the &quot;kritis&quot; were composed in the style of a Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP) with the &quot;charanams&quot; (stanzas) substituting for the &quot;kalpana swaras&quot; (improvisatory passages) in the &quot;pallavi&quot; section of the RTP.

The &quot;Pancharatna Kritis&quot; are:
# Jagadananda Karaka (Ragam Natai)
# Duduku gala (Ragam Goula)
# Sadhinchene (Ragam Arabhi)
# Kanakana Ruchira (Ragam Varali)
# Endaro Mahanubhavulu (Shree Ragam)

The melodic forms of these compositions (Nata, Goula, Arabhi, Varali, Sri) are the five &quot;Ghana ragas&quot; of Carnatic music, also called the &quot;ghanapanchaka&quot;. These five ragas lend themselves to elaborate improvisations. They are so called because they are suited for playing tanam on the veena. Nata and Varali are the most ancient of the Carnatic ragas and date back to over a thousand years ago.

A particularly difficult musical challenge has been taken up successfully by Tyagaraja in three of these compositions. The raga Naata has a particularly distinctive use of the &quot;dhaivatam&quot; note or swara (A in the C scale of Western classical notes). Tyagaraja has avoided the &quot;dhaivatam&quot; completely in the first &quot;Pancharatna Kriti&quot; without losing the &quot;swarupa&quot;, or character, of the ragam. Similarly &quot;gandharam&quot; is a note of some beauty in Goula (E in the C scale). Tyagaraja has made minimal use of this note, without losing the character of the ragam. Finally, he avoids &quot;dhaivatam&quot; in Sri ragam, again a note that is present in some very characteristic &quot;sancharas&quot; (phrases) of this ragam.

==Lyrical synopsis==
===&quot;Jagadānanda kārakā&quot;===
In this song, Tyagaraja praises Ramachandra, one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. He eulogizes Ramachandra as one who is the cause of all bliss in the universe. which was used in the court of the Maratha king Sarabhoji who ruled this area in the 18th century. Rama was Tyagaraja&#x27;s favorite god. The kriti is set to Nata raga.

===&quot;Duḍukugala nannē dora koḍuku brōchurā yentō&quot;===
In this second &quot;Pancharatna Kriti&quot; composed in Telugu, Tyagaraja lists all the errors he has committed in his life and asks who but Rama could redeem such a sinner. The sins described include: just wandering around as though being satisfied with a full meal, giving sermons to people who are not interested in listening or who do not have the capability to understand, self-styling oneself as a great person, and mistaking the dross for the real thing. He lists four categories of people to whom he has made the claim of greatness; the ignorant, the riff-raff, the low social folk and women. In a play on words, he reproaches those who desire wives and progeny. The kriti is set to Gowla raga.

===&quot;Sādhinchene ō manasā&quot;===
This &quot;Pancharatna Kriti&quot; was composed in Telugu and has been set to Arabhi raga. It is written in a playful tone, rich with metaphor and simile without a surfeit of adjectives - all the while arresting the attention of the singers. In this &quot;kriti&quot;, Tyagaraja sings the greatness of the lord Krishna in a lucid manner. The style adopted in this &quot;kriti&quot; is very sweet in comparison with the other four.

===&quot;Kana kana ruci rā kanaka vasana ninnu&quot;===
This is the least sung or performed of the five &quot;Pancharatna Kritis&quot; composed in Telugu, but it is considered by some to be the most lingering and beautiful. It describes the divine beauty of Sri Rama, whom Tyagaraja worshiped. He says that the more he Tyagaraja looks upon His beautiful features, the more his mind is attracted to Him Sri Rama. This composition is rarely taught, and rarely heard in concerts, owing to the raga it is set to Varali raga.

===&quot;Endarō mahānubhāvulu&quot;===

&quot;Endarō mahānubhāvulu&quot; is believed to be one of the earlier &quot;kritis&quot; Tyagaraja composed in Telugu. The song is a salutation to and praise of all the great saints and musicians down the ages. Tyagaraja clearly delineates and lists the &quot;Mahanubhavalu&quot;, or great ones, in the &quot;kriti&quot; itself, mentioning the saints Narada and Saunaka, among others. In this kriti, Tyagaraja describes the greatness of devotees of the Lord. The belief in Kerala and Tamil Nadu is that Tyagaraja composed the &quot;kriti&quot; spontaneously in his joy upon hearing the divine music of the Malayali singer Shadkala Govinda Marar. But according to the Walajapet disciples&#x27; version of the origin of the &quot;kriti&quot;, it was composed and learned by Tyagaraja&#x27;s disciples before the arrival of Marar. This, according to P. T. Narendra Menon, was the legendary, historically significant meeting between two great musicians. Since &quot;Endharo mahanubhavalu&quot; is said to have been composed by Tyagaraja at a young age, it is possible that after hearing Marar sing and in appreciation of the greatness of Marar, Tyagaraja could have asked his disciples to sing the &quot;kriti&quot; on this occasion. Humility is the foundation of all. The kriti is set to Shri raga

==Miscellaneous==
M. S. Subbulakshmi, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Maharajapuram Santhanam, and Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna are among the hundreds of great Indian classical vocalists who have brought these &quot;kritis&quot; closer to the modern world.

<text>The Church of Christ, informally called Hedrickites and the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), is a denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement headquartered in Independence, Missouri, on what is known as the Temple Lot. The nickname for members of the church comes from the surname of Granville Hedrick, who was ordained as the church&#x27;s leader in July 1863. Unlike the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Community of Christ, the Temple Lot church rejects the office of prophet or president, being instead led by its Quorum of Twelve Apostles. The church also rejects the doctrines of baptism for the dead and celestial marriage promulgated by the Utah-based LDS Church, as well as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. While once avidly engaged in dialogue with other Latter Day Saint factions, the church no longer has any official contact with any other organization. It is notable for its sole ownership of the Temple Lot, which it has held for nearly 150 years. As of 2013, membership is 7,310 members in 11 countries. Most of the members live in the United States, but there are parishes in Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Nigeria, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Tanzania, India, Ethiopia, and the Philippines.

==History==

===Origins===

The Temple Lot church shares its early history with the larger Latter-Day Saint denominations, including the LDS Church and the Community of Christ (formerly the RLDS Church). After the death of Joseph Smith, the Latter Day Saint movement&#x27;s founder, on June 27, 1844, several leaders vied for control and established rival organizations. By the 1860s, five early Mormon branches found themselves unaffiliated with any larger group. Located in Bloomington, Illinois; Crow Creek, Illinois; Half Moon Prairie, Illinois; Eagle Creek, Illinois; and Vermillion, Indiana, these branches united under the leadership of Granville Hedrick in May 1863. On July 18, 1863, Hedrick was ordained as &quot;President, Prophet, Seer and Revelator&quot;. Participating in Hedrick&#x27;s ordination was John E. Page who had been an apostle under Smith. The Temple Lot church affirms a founding date of April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York, and claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Smith&#x27;s original Church of Christ. Hedrick later distanced himself from the title of &quot;President&quot;, as he ultimately came to believe that this was an unscriptural office.

At the time of its commencement in 1863, Hedrick retained the name of &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; for his organization, reflecting his insistence that it was a continuation of Smith&#x27;s church, which had adopted that name in 1838. This was soon shortened to &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, however, as this had been the name under which Smith originally incorporated the church in 1830. Hedrick also wished to distinguish his church from the LDS Church in Utah. The parenthetical &quot;(Temple Lot)&quot;, while not part of the legal name of the church, is usually appended to the name to distinguish the church from the many other Latter Day Saint and non–Latter Day Saint churches that use the name &quot;Church of Christ&quot;.

===Temple Lot===

The church currently occupies a property in Independence, Missouri, known as the Temple Lot. This grassy, plot is considered by Latter Day Saints of nearly all persuasions to be the site designated by Joseph Smith for the temple of the New Jerusalem, a sacred city to be built preparatory to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The Hedrickites returned to Independence in 1867 to purchase the designated lot for this temple, and the church has been headquartered there ever since. In 1891, the church was sued by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for title to the Temple Lot. The RLDS Church won at trial, but this decision was reversed on appeal. In the 1930s, the Temple Lot church excavated the site in an attempt to build a temple, but their efforts stalled because of the Great Depression and internal disputes, and the excavation was filled in 1946. The lot was re-landscaped, and is today occupied only by the church&#x27;s headquarters and a few trees in its northeast corner. No further plans to erect such an edifice have been announced.

===Church burnings===
In July 1898, W. D. C. Pattison, a suspended member of the LDS Church from Boston, Massachusetts, was arrested and briefly detained after attempting to remove a fence placed around the Temple Lot. Late in the following month, he reportedly demanded that church officials sign ownership of the property over to him because he believed he was the &quot;One Mighty and Strong&quot;. He was detained by police but released a few days later. Early on September 5, 1898, he set fire to the tiny headquarters building, and then walked to the police station and turned himself in. After he testified in court appearances in November 1898, Pattison was found guilty but insane and sentenced to a stay in a mental institution. The building was reconstructed in 1905.
On January 1, 1990, a member of the Church of Christ who had recently joined the LDS Church set fire to the unoccupied church building on the Temple Lot, claiming that his actions were part of a political protest and a prophecy that war was coming to America. The fire caused significant damage to the second story of the building, although the first floor containing church records and documents remained intact. On February 1, 1990, the remainder of the building was razed. Construction of a new headquarters building began in August 1990. The man was convicted by a jury of second-degree arson and breaking and entering on January 16, 1991.

===Divisions===
In 1929, the Temple Lot church split between adherents and opponents of a series of &quot;messages&quot; allegedly given by John the Baptist to Otto Fetting, an apostle of the church. While the first eleven of these missives were accepted by the Temple Lot membership, the twelfth was rejected, leading Fetting to withdraw with a portion of the membership and found The Church of Christ (Fettingite). The Temple Lot organization retained the church name and properties, including the Temple Lot.

Fetting&#x27;s organization later divided after his death into three factions: the first followed the teachings of apostle S. T. Bronson and accepted a Saturday Sabbath; the second rejected Bronson&#x27;s teachings while remaining faithful to Fetting&#x27;s. The third faction was composed of adherents of William A. Draves, who claimed that the &quot;Messenger&quot; was appearing to him after Fetting&#x27;s death. Draves&#x27;s adherents would form the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, which later gave birth to other sects.

Another sect breaking with the Temple Lot church was the Church of Christ (Hancock), founded in 1946 by Pauline Hancock, who had resigned from the Temple Lot church due to her disagreements with that organization over its teachings on the Godhead. This church initially accepted only the King James Bible and Book of Mormon as scripture, though it rejected the latter in 1973 and formally dissolved itself in 1984. Hancock was the first woman to found and lead a church in the Latter Day Saint movement.

Although all of these sects (with the exception of the last) have similar core beliefs— reflected in their use of the same &quot;Articles of Faith and Practice&quot;—none of them recognizes the others as legitimate.

==Doctrines==

===Church leadership===
Although the Temple Lot church accepts the veracity of Joseph Smith as a prophet of God, it does not necessarily accept everything that Smith taught or claimed to be revelation. One distinct difference between it and other Latter-Day Saint churches lies in its rejection of the office of President of the Church. Instead of a president–prophet, the Church of Christ is led by its Quorum of Twelve Apostles, with all members of that body being considered equal in precedence and authority. Members of the Temple Lot church believe that Smith was wrong to assume the office of church president, an office they deem to not have been provided for in either the Bible or the Book of Mormon, their two scriptural standards. Although Granville Hedrick was ordained to be president of his church in 1863, he later repudiated this ordination, even referring to Smith as a &quot;fallen prophet&quot;.

Like the LDS Church, but unlike the Community of Christ, the Temple Lot church limits its priesthood offices to men.

===Authority===
The Church of Christ assumes its authority from Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery&#x27;s account of May 15, 1829, when John the Baptist came to them and ordained them to the Priesthood of Aaron, &quot;which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness&quot;. John said that he came to them on behalf of the ancient apostles Peter, James, and John. In Smith&#x27;s account, he and Cowdery were baptized and were given the keys of the Aaronic priesthood, which included the authority to baptize. The messenger told them that the priesthood they were ordained to did not hold the keys of conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that that authority would be conferred upon them later. Smith and Cowdery reported that Peter, James, and John visited them later that same year and bestowed upon them the higher Melchizedek priesthood.

===The only true church===
The Church of Christ teaches that it is the only true church in the modern world and that all other churches are an abomination in the eyes of the Lord. As published on the official church website: &quot;There is no other authority to represent the Kingdom of God on the earth in modern times, nor had there been in the churches for 1260 years prior to 1830&quot;.

===Scriptures===
The Church of Christ rejects the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, as well as Joseph Smith&#x27;s &quot;Inspired Version&quot; of the Bible, preferring to use only the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon as doctrinal standards. The Book of Commandments is accepted as being superior to the Doctrine and Covenants as a compendium of Smith&#x27;s early revelations (due to changes effected in many Doctrine and Covenants sections that had earlier been printed in the Book of Commandments), but is not accorded the same status as the Bible or Book of Mormon. The Temple Lot church publishes its own edition of the Book of Mormon, identical in chaptering and versification to versions printed by the Community of Christ. &quot;The Word of the Lord&quot;, used by the Fettingite and Elijah Message organizations, which broke off from the Temple Lot church, is rejected; however, the Temple Lot church maintains an openness to the idea that revelation might conceivably come to any member of the church at any time, whether male or female, holder of the priesthood or not.

===Other doctrinal distinctions===
Baptism for the dead, celestial marriage, plural marriage, and exaltation doctrines are all rejected by the Temple Lot church. The offices of high priest and patriarch are also rejected as being &quot;doctrinal innovations&quot; not sanctioned in the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Book of Commandments.

===Temples===
Temple Lot church members still believe that a temple will be reared on the Temple Lot, but it will not be like any of the LDS Church or Community of Christ temples currently in use. Rather, it has been generally described by the Temple Lot organization as a place for Jesus to show himself and &quot;endow his servants whom he chooses with power to preach the gospel in all the world to every kindred, tongue, and people, that the promise of God to Israel may be fulfilled&quot;. The church does not accept the legitimacy of the Community of Christ&#x27;s Independence Temple, located across the street from the Temple Lot, nor of any of the over 165 temples constructed by the LDS Church.

===David Whitmer===
Doctrines of the Church of Christ are heavily influenced by the writings of David Whitmer, a leading figure of early Mormonism who was expelled from Smith&#x27;s church in 1838. In 1887, Whitmer published a pamphlet deeply critical of Sidney Rigdon and Smith. This pamphlet, entitled &quot;An Address to all Believers in Christ&quot;, is widely read and promoted among members of the Church of Christ today, and is on sale in the lobby of its headquarters building. In it, Whitmer repeatedly claims that Smith had &quot;fallen&quot;—or began to &quot;fall&quot;—from his divine calling almost as soon as the church was established in 1830, or perhaps even before then. Whitmer&#x27;s reasoning includes his charge that Smith was to have &quot;pretended to no other gift&quot; except the translation of the Book of Mormon, and was never to be more than a &quot;first elder&quot; among &quot;fellow elders&quot; in the fledgling church.
