<text>The Battle of Karbala () was fought on 10 October 680 (10 Muharram in the year 61 AH of the Islamic calendar) between the army of the second Umayyad caliph Yazid I () and a small army led by Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, at Karbala, Sawad (modern-day southern Iraq).

Prior to his death, the Umayyad caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I () had nominated his son Yazid as his successor. Yazid&#x27;s nomination was contested by the sons of a few prominent companions of Muhammad, including Husayn, son of the fourth caliph Ali, and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, son of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam. Upon Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death in 680, Yazid demanded allegiance from Husayn and other dissidents. Husayn did not give allegiance and traveled to Mecca. The people of Kufa, an Iraqi garrison town and the center of Ali&#x27;s caliphate, were averse to the Syria-based Umayyad caliphs and had a long-standing attachment to the house of Ali. They proposed Husayn overthrow the Umayyads. On Husayn&#x27;s way to Kufa with a retinue of about 70 men, his caravan was intercepted by a 1,000-strong army of the caliph at some distance from Kufa. He was forced to head north and encamp in the plain of Karbala on 2 October, where a larger Umayyad army of 4,000 arrived soon afterwards. Negotiations failed after the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad refused Husayn safe passage without submitting to his authority, a condition declined by Husayn. Battle ensued on 10 October during which Husayn was killed along with most of his relatives and companions, while his surviving family members were taken prisoner. The battle was the start of the Second Fitna, during which the Iraqis organized two separate campaigns to avenge the death of Husayn; the first one by the Tawwabin and the other one by Mukhtar al-Thaqafi and his supporters.

The Battle of Karbala galvanized the development of the pro-Alid party (&quot;Shi&#x27;at Ali&quot;) into a distinct religious sect with its own rituals and collective memory. It has a central place in Shi&#x27;a history, tradition, and theology, and has frequently been recounted in Shi&#x27;a literature. For the Shi&#x27;a, Husayn&#x27;s suffering and death became a symbol of sacrifice in the struggle for right against wrong, and for justice and truth against injustice and falsehood. It also provides the members of the Shi&#x27;a faith with a catalog of heroic norms. The battle is commemorated during an annual ten-day period during the Islamic month of Muharram by Shi&#x27;a, culminating on tenth day of the month, known as the Day of &quot;Ashura&quot;. On this day, Shi&#x27;a Muslims mourn, hold public processions, organize religious gathering, beat their chests and in some cases self-flagellate. Sunni Muslims likewise regard the incident as a historical tragedy; Husayn and his companions are widely regarded as martyrs by both Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Muslims.

==Political background==
After the third caliph Uthman&#x27;s assassination by rebels in 656, the rebels and the townspeople of Medina declared Ali, a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, caliph. Some of Muhammad&#x27;s companions including Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (then governor of Syria), and Muhammad&#x27;s widow A&#x27;isha, refused to recognize Ali. They called for revenge against Uthman&#x27;s killers and the election of a new caliph through &quot;shura&quot; (consultation). These events precipitated the First Fitna (First Muslim Civil War). When Ali was assassinated by Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam, a Kharijite, in 661, his eldest son Hasan succeeded him but soon signed a peace treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya to avoid further bloodshed. In the treaty, Hasan was to hand over power to Mu&#x27;awiya on the condition that Mu&#x27;awiya be a just ruler and that he would not establish a dynasty. After the death of Hasan in 670, his younger brother Husayn became the head of the Banu Hashim clan to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad also belonged. Though his father&#x27;s supporters in Kufa gave him their allegiance, he would abide to the peace treaty between Hasan and Mu&#x27;awiya as long as the latter was alive.

The Battle of Karbala occurred within the crisis resulting from the succession of Yazid I. In 676, Mu&#x27;awiya nominated his son Yazid as successor, a move labelled by the historian Wilferd Madelung as breach of the Hasan–Muawiya treaty. With no precedence in Islamic history, hereditary succession aroused opposition from several quarters. Mu&#x27;awiya summoned a &quot;shura&quot;, or consultative assembly, in Damascus and persuaded representatives from many provinces to agree to his plan by diplomacy and bribes. He then ordered Marwan ibn al-Hakam, then the governor of Medina, where Husayn and several other influential Muslims resided, to announce the decision. Marwan faced resistance to this announcement, especially from Husayn, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Abd Allah ibn Umar and Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, the sons of Muhammad&#x27;s prominent companions, all of whom, by virtue of their descent, could also lay claim to the caliphal title. Mu&#x27;awiya went to Medina and pressed the four dissenters to accede. He followed and threatened some of them with death, but they still refused to support him. Nonetheless, Mu&#x27;awiya convinced the people of Mecca that the four had pledged their allegiance, and received allegiance from them for Yazid. On his return to Damascus, he secured allegiance from the people of Medina as well. There was no further overt protest against the plan for Yazid&#x27;s succession. According to the historians Fitzpatrick and Walker, Yazid&#x27;s succession, which was considered as an &quot;anomaly in Islamic history&quot;, transformed the government from a &quot;consultative&quot; form to a monarchy. Before his death in April 680, Mu&#x27;awiya cautioned Yazid that Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr might challenge his rule and instructed him to defeat them if they did. Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad.

==Prelude==
On his succession, Yazid charged the governor of Medina, al-Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn, Ibn al-Zubayr and Abd Allah ibn Umar, with force if necessary. Walid sought the advice of his Umayyad relative Marwan ibn al-Hakam, who suggested that Ibn al-Zubayr and Husayn should be forced to pledge allegiance as they were dangerous, while Ibn Umar should be left alone since he posed no threat. Walid summoned the two, but Ibn al-Zubayr escaped to Mecca. Husayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting, suggesting it should be done in public. Marwan told Walid to imprison or behead him, but due to Husayn&#x27;s kinship with Muhammad, Walid was unwilling to take any action against him. A few days later, Husayn left for Mecca without acknowledging Yazid. He arrived in Mecca at the beginning of May 680, and stayed there until the beginning of September.

Husayn had considerable support in Kufa, which had been the caliphal capital during the reigns of his father and brother. The Kufans had fought the Umayyads and their Syrian allies during the First Fitna, the five-year civil war which had established the Umayyad Caliphate. They were dissatisfied with Hasan&#x27;s abdication and strongly resented Umayyad rule. While in Mecca, Husayn received letters from pro-Alids in Kufa informing him that they were tired of the Umayyad rule, which they considered to be oppressive, and that they had no rightful leader. They asked him to lead them in revolt against Yazid, promising to remove the Umayyad governor if Husayn would consent to aid them. Husayn wrote back affirmatively that a rightful leader is the one who acts according to the Qur&#x27;an and promised to lead them with the right guidance. Then he sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in Kufa. Ibn Aqil attracted widespread support and informed Husayn of the situation, suggesting that he join them there. Yazid removed Nu&#x27;man ibn Bashir al-Ansari as governor of Kufa due to his inaction, and installed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, then governor of Basra, in his place. As a result of Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil&#x27;s following began to dissipate and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely. It was defeated and Ibn Aqil was killed. Husayn had also sent a messenger to Basra, another garrison town in Iraq, but the messenger could not attract any following and was quickly apprehended and executed.

Husayn was unaware of the change of political circumstances in Kufa and decided to depart. Abd Allah ibn Abbas and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr advised him not to move to Iraq, or if he was determined, not to take women and children with him. The sincerity of Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s advice has been doubted by many historians, however, as he had his own plans for leadership and was supposedly happy to be rid of Husayn. Nevertheless, he offered Husayn support if he would stay in Mecca and lead the opposition to Yazid from there. Husayn refused this, citing his abhorrence of bloodshed in the sanctuary, and decided to go ahead with his plan.

==Journey towards Kufa==

Husayn left Mecca with some fifty men and his family on 9 September 680 (8 Dhu al-Hijjah 60 AH), a day before Hajj. He took the northerly route through the Arabian Desert. On persuasion of Husayn&#x27;s cousin Abd Allah ibn Ja&#x27;far, the governor of Mecca Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id sent his brother and Ibn Ja&#x27;far after Husayn in order to assure him safety in Mecca and bring him back. Husayn refused to return, relating that Muhammad had ordered him in a dream to move forward irrespective of the consequences. At a place known as Tan&#x27;im, he seized a caravan carrying dyeing plants and clothes sent by the governor of Yemen to Yazid. Further on the way, at a place called Tha&#x27;labiyya, the small caravan received the news of the execution of Ibn Aqil and the indifference of the people of Kufa. Husayn at this point is reported to have considered turning back, but was persuaded to push forward by Ibn Aqil&#x27;s brothers, who wanted to avenge his death; according to Madelung and I. K. A. Howard, these reports are doubtful. Later, at Zubala, Husayn learned of the capture and execution of his messenger Qays ibn Musahir al-Saydawi, whom he had sent from the Hejaz (western Arabia) to Kufa to announce his arrival. He informed his followers of the situation and asked them to leave. Most of the people who had joined him on the way left, while his companions from Mecca decided to stay with him.

Ibn Ziyad had stationed troops on the routes into Kufa. Husayn and his followers were intercepted by the vanguard of Yazid&#x27;s army, about 1,000 men led by al-Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi, south of Kufa near Qadisiyya. Husayn said to them: I did not come to you until your letters were brought to me, and your messengers came to me saying, &#x27;Come to us, for we have no imām. God may unite us in the truth through you.&#x27; Since this was your view, I have come to you. Therefore, if you give me what you guaranteed in your covenants and sworn testimonies, I will come to your town. If you will not and are averse to my coming, I will leave you for the place from which I came to you. He then showed them the letters he had received from the Kufans, including some in Hurr&#x27;s force. Hurr denied any knowledge of the letters and stated that Husayn must go with him to Ibn Ziyad, which Husayn refused to do. Hurr responded that he would not allow Husayn to either enter Kufa or go back to Medina, but that he was free to travel anywhere else he wished. Nevertheless, he did not prevent four Kufans from joining Husayn. Husayn&#x27;s caravan started to move towards Qadisiyya, and Hurr followed them. At Naynawa, Hurr received orders from Ibn Ziyad to force Husayn&#x27;s caravan to halt in a desolate place without fortifications or water. One of Husayn&#x27;s companions suggested that they attack Hurr and move to the fortified village of al-Aqr. Husayn refused, stating that he did not want to start the hostilities. On 2 October 680 (2 Muharram 61 AH), Husayn arrived at Karbala, a desert plain north of Kufa, and set up camp.
On the following day, a 4,000-strong Kufan army arrived under the command of Umar ibn Sa&#x27;d. He had been appointed governor of Rayy to suppress a local rebellion, but then recalled to confront Husayn. Initially, he was unwilling to fight Husayn, but complied following Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s threat to revoke his governorship. After negotiations with Husayn, Ibn Sa&#x27;d wrote to Ibn Ziyad that Husayn was willing to return. Ibn Ziyad replied that Husayn must surrender or he should be subdued by force, and that to compel him, he and his companions should be denied access to the Euphrates river. Ibn Sa&#x27;d stationed 500 horsemen on the route leading to the river. Husayn and his companions remained without water for three days before a group of fifty men led by his half-brother Abbas was able to access the river. They could only fill twenty water-skins.

Husayn and Ibn Sa&#x27;d met during the night to negotiate a settlement; it was rumored that Husayn made three proposals: either he be allowed to return to Medina, submit to Yazid directly, or be sent to a border post where he would fight alongside the Muslim armies. According to Madelung, these reports are probably untrue as Husayn at this stage is unlikely to have considered submitting to Yazid. A &quot;mawla&quot; of Husayn&#x27;s wife later claimed that Husayn had suggested that he be allowed to leave, so that all parties could allow the fluid political situation to clarify. Ibn Sa&#x27;d sent the proposal, whatever it was, to Ibn Ziyad, who is reported to have accepted but then persuaded otherwise by Shemr ibn Ziljawshan. Shemr argued that Husayn was in his domain and letting him go would be to demonstrate weakness. Ibn Ziyad then sent Shemr with orders to ask Husayn for his allegiance once more and to attack, kill and disfigure him if he was to refuse, as &quot;a rebel, a seditious person, a brigand, an oppressor and he was to do no further harm after his death&quot;. If Ibn Sa&#x27;d was unwilling to carry out the attack, he was instructed to hand over command to Shemr. Ibn Sa&#x27;d cursed Shemr and accused him of foiling his attempts to reach a peaceful settlement but agreed to carry out the orders. He remarked that Husayn would not submit because there was &quot;a proud soul in him&quot;.

The army advanced toward Husayn&#x27;s camp on the evening of 9 October. Husayn sent Abbas to ask Ibn Sa&#x27;d to wait until the next morning, so that they could consider the matter. Ibn Sa&#x27;d agreed to this respite. Husayn told his men that they were all free to leave, with his family, under the cover of night, since their opponents only wanted him. Very few availed themselves of this opportunity. Defense arrangements were made: tents were brought together and tied to one another and a ditch was dug behind the tents and filled with wood ready to be set alight in case of attack. Husayn and his followers then spent the rest of the night praying.

==Battle==
After the morning prayer on 10 October, both parties took up battle positions. Husayn appointed Zuhayr ibn Qayn to command the right flank of his army, Habib ibn Muzahir to command the left flank, and his half-brother Abbas as the standard bearer. Husayn&#x27;s companions, according to most accounts, numbered thirty-two horsemen and forty infantrymen; although forty-five horsemen and one hundred foot-soldiers, or a total of a few hundred men have been reported by some sources. Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army totaled 4,000. According to the Shi&#x27;a sources, however, more troops had joined Ibn Sa&#x27;d in preceding days, swelling his army to 30,000 strong. The ditch containing wood was set alight. Husayn then delivered a speech to his opponents reminding them of his status as Muhammad&#x27;s grandson and reproaching them for inviting and then abandoning him. He asked to be allowed to leave. He was told that first he had to submit to Yazid&#x27;s authority, which he refused to do. Husayn&#x27;s speech moved Al-Hurr ibn Yazid Al-Tamimi to defect to his side.

After Husayn&#x27;s speech, Zuhayr ibn Qayn attempted to dissuade Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s soldiers from killing Husayn, but in vain. Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army fired several volleys of arrows. This was followed by duels in which several of Husayn&#x27;s companions were slain. The right wing of the Kufans, led by Amr ibn al-Hajjaj, attacked Husayn&#x27;s force, but was repulsed. Hand-to-hand fighting paused and further volleys of arrows were exchanged. Shemr, who commanded the left wing of the Umayyad army, launched an attack, but after losses on both sides he was repulsed. This was followed by cavalry attacks. Husayn&#x27;s cavalry resisted fiercely and Ibn Sa&#x27;d brought in armoured cavalry and five hundred archers. After their horses were wounded by arrows, Husayn&#x27;s cavalrymen dismounted and fought on foot.

Since Umayyad forces could approach Husayn&#x27;s army from the front only, Ibn Sa&#x27;d ordered the tents to be burned. All except the one which Husayn and his family were using were set on fire. Shemr wanted to burn that one too, but was prevented by his companions. The plan backfired and flames hindered the Umayyad advance for a while. After noon prayers, Husayn&#x27;s companions were encircled, and almost all of them were killed. Husayn&#x27;s relatives, who had not taken part in the fighting so far, joined the battle. Husayn&#x27;s son Ali Akbar was killed; then Husayn&#x27;s half-brothers, including Abbas, and the sons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib, Jafar ibn Abi Talib and Hasan ibn Ali were slain. The account of Abbas&#x27; death is not given in the primary sources, al-Tabari and Baladhuri, but a prominent Shi&#x27;a theologian Shaykh Al-Mufid states in his account in &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; that Abbas went to the river together with Husayn but became separated, was surrounded, and killed. At some point, a young child of Husayn&#x27;s, who was sitting on his lap, was hit by an arrow and died.

=== Death of Husayn ibn Ali ===

The Umayyad soldiers hesitated to attack Husayn directly, but he was struck in the mouth by an arrow as he went to the river to drink. He collected his blood in a cupped hand and cast towards the sky, complaining to God of his suffering. Later, he was surrounded and struck on the head by Malik ibn Nusayr. The blow cut through his hooded cloak, which Husayn removed while cursing his attacker. He put a cap on his head and wrapped a turban around it to staunch the bleeding. Ibn Nusayr seized the bloodied cloak and retreated.

Shemr advanced with a group of foot soldiers towards Husayn, who was now prepared to fight as few people were left on his side. A young boy from Husayn&#x27;s camp escaped from the tents, ran to him, tried to defend him from a sword stroke and had his arm cut off. Ibn Sa&#x27;d approached the tents, and Husayn&#x27;s sister Zaynab complained to him: &quot;&#x27;Umar b. Sa&#x27;d, will Abu &#x27;Abd Allah (the kunya of Husayn) be killed while you stand and watch?&quot; Ibn Sa&#x27;d wept but did nothing. Husayn is said to have killed many of his attackers. They were, however, still unwilling to kill him and each of them wanted to leave this to somebody else. Eventually Shemr shouted: &quot;Shame on you! Why are you waiting for the man? Kill him, may your mothers be deprived of you!&quot; The Umayyad soldiers then rushed Husayn and wounded him on his hand and shoulder. He fell on the ground face-down and an attacker named Sinan ibn Anas stabbed and then decapitated him.

==Aftermath==

Seventy or seventy-two people died on Husayn&#x27;s side, of whom about twenty were descendants of Abu Talib, the father of Ali. This included two of Husayn&#x27;s sons, six of his paternal brothers, three sons of Hasan ibn Ali, three sons of Jafar ibn Abi Talib, and three sons and three grandsons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib. Following the battle, Husayn&#x27;s clothes were stripped, and his sword, shoes and baggage were taken. The women&#x27;s jewelry and cloaks were also seized. Shemr wanted to kill Husayn&#x27;s only surviving son Ali Zayn al-Abidin, who had not taken part in the fighting because of illness, but was prevented by Ibn Sa&#x27;d. There are reports of more than sixty wounds on Husayn&#x27;s body, which was then trampled with horses as previously instructed by Ibn Ziyad. The bodies of Husayn&#x27;s companions were decapitated. There were eighty-eight dead in Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army, who were buried before he left. After his departure, members of the Banu Asad tribe, from the nearby village of Ghadiriya, buried the headless bodies of Husayn&#x27;s companions.

Husayn&#x27;s family, along with the heads of the dead, were sent to Ibn Ziyad. He poked Husayn&#x27;s mouth with a stick and intended to kill Ali Zayn al-Abidin, but spared him after the pleas of Husayn&#x27;s sister Zaynab. The heads and the family were then sent to Yazid, who also poked Husayn&#x27;s mouth with a stick. The historian Henri Lammens has suggested that this is a duplication of the report regarding Ibn Ziyad. Yazid was compassionate towards the women and Ali Zayn al-Abidin, and cursed Ibn Ziyad for murdering Husayn, stating that had he been there, he would have spared him. One of his courtiers asked for the hand of a captive woman from Husayn&#x27;s family in marriage, which resulted in heated altercation between Yazid and Zaynab. The women of Yazid&#x27;s household joined the captive women in their lamentation for the dead. After a few days, the women were compensated for their belongings looted in Karbala and were sent back to Medina.

===Tawwabin uprising===

A few prominent Alid supporters in Kufa felt guilty for abandoning Husayn after having invited him to revolt. To atone for what they perceived as their sin, they began a movement known as the Tawwabin, under Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad, to fight the Umayyads. As long as Iraq was in Umayyad hands, the movement remained underground. After the death of Yazid in November 683, the people of Iraq drove out the Umayyad governor Ibn Ziyad; the Tawwabin called on the people to avenge Husayn&#x27;s death, attracting large-scale support. Lacking any political program, they intended to punish the Umayyads or sacrifice themselves in the struggle. Their slogan was &quot;Revenge for Husayn&quot;. Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, another prominent pro-Alid of Kufa, attempted to dissuade the Tawwabin from this endeavor in favor of an organized movement to take control of the city, but Ibn Surad&#x27;s stature as a companion of Muhammad and an old ally of Ali, prevented most of his followers from accepting Mukhtar&#x27;s proposal. Although 16,000 men enlisted to fight, only 4,000 mustered. In November 684, the Tawwabin left to confront the Umayyads, after mourning for a day at Husayn&#x27;s grave in Karbala. The armies met in January 685 at the three-day Battle of Ayn al-Warda in present-day northern Syria; most of the Tawwabin, including Ibn Surad, were killed. A few escaped to Kufa and joined Mukhtar.

===Revolt of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi===

Mukhtar was an early settler of Kufa, having arrived in Iraq following its initial conquest by the Muslims. He had participated in the failed rebellion of Muslim ibn Aqil, for which he was imprisoned by Ibn Ziyad, before being released after the intervention of Abd Allah ibn Umar. Mukhtar then went to Mecca and had a short-lived alliance with Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who had established himself in Mecca in opposition to Yazid. After Yazid&#x27;s death, he returned to Kufa where he advocated revenge against Husayn&#x27;s killers and the establishment of an Alid caliphate in the name of Husayn&#x27;s half-brother Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, and declared himself his representative. The defeat of the Tawwabin left the leadership of the Kufan pro-Alids in his hands. In October 685, Mukhtar and his supporters, a significant of number of whom consisted of local converts (&quot;mawali&quot;), overthrew Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s governor and seized Kufa. His control extended to most of Iraq and parts of northwestern Iran. His attitude towards &quot;mawali&quot;, whom he awarded many favors and equal status with Arabs, provoked a rebellion by the dissatisfied Arab aristocracy. After crushing the rebellion, Mukhtar executed Kufans involved in the killing of Husayn, including Ibn Sa&#x27;d and Shemr, while thousands of people fled to Basra. He then sent his general Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar to fight an approaching Umayyad army, led by Ibn Ziyad, which had been sent to reconquer the province. The Umayyad army was routed at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 and Ibn Ziyad was slain. Meanwhile, Mukhtar&#x27;s relations with Ibn al-Zubayr worsened and Kufan refugees in Basra persuaded Mus&#x27;ab ibn al-Zubayr, the governor of the city and younger brother of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, to attack Kufa. Facing defeat in open battle, Mukhtar and his remaining supporters took refuge in the palace of Kufa and were besieged by Mus&#x27;ab. Four months later, in April 687, Mukhtar was killed while some 6,000–8,000 of his supporters were executed. According to Mohsen Zakeri, Mukhtar&#x27;s attitude towards &quot;mawali&quot; was one of the reasons behind his failure, as Kufa was not ready for such &quot;revolutionary measures&quot;. Mukhtar&#x27;s supporters survived the collapse of his revolution and evolved into a sect known as the Kaysanites. The Hashimiyya, a splinter group of the Kaysanites, was later taken over by the Abbasids and eventually overthrew the Umayyads in 750.

==Primary and classic sources==

The primary source of the Karbala narrative is the work of the Kufan historian Abu Mikhnaf titled &quot;Kitab Maqtal Al-Husayn&quot;. Other early monographs on the death of Husayn, which have not survived, were written by al-Asbagh al-Nubata, Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju&#x27;fi, Ammar ibn Mu&#x27;awiya al-Duhni, Awana ibn al-Hakam, al-Waqidi, Hisham ibn al-Kalbi, Nasr ibn Muzahim, and al-Mada&#x27;ini; of these al-Nubta&#x27;s monograph was perhaps the earliest. Although Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, he was an adult by the time of the revolt of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath, which occurred in 701, some twenty years after the Battle of Karbala. As such he knew many eyewitnesses and collected firsthand accounts and some with very short chains of transmission, usually only one or two intermediaries. The eyewitnesses were of two kinds: those from Husayn&#x27;s side; and those from Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s army. Since few people from Husayn&#x27;s camp survived, most eyewitnesses were from the second category. According to Julius Wellhausen, most of them regretted their actions in the battle and embellished the accounts of the battle in favor of Husayn in order to dilute their guilt. Although as an Iraqi, Abu Mikhnaf had pro-Alid tendencies, his reports generally do not contain much bias on his part. Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s original text seems to have been lost and the version extant today has been transmitted through secondary sources such as the &quot;History of Prophets and Kings&quot;, also known as &quot;The History of Tabari&quot;, by Muḥammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari; and &quot;Ansab al-Ashraf&quot; by Ahmad ibn Yaḥya al-Baladhuri. Nevertheless, four manuscripts of a &quot;Maqtal&quot; located at Gotha (No. 1836), Berlin (Sprenger, Nos. 159–160), Leiden (No. 792), and Saint Petersburg (Am No. 78) libraries have been attributed to Abu Mikhnaf. Tabari quotes either directly from Abu Mikhnaf or from his student Ibn al-Kalbi, who took most of his material from Abu Mikhnaf. Tabari occasionally takes material from Ammar ibn Mu&#x27;awiya, Awana and other primary sources, which, however, adds little to the narrative. Baladhuri uses same sources as Tabari. Information on the battle found in the works of Dinawari and Ya&#x27;qubi is also based on Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s &quot;Maqtal&quot;, although they occasionally provide some extra notes and verses. Other secondary sources include al-Mas&#x27;udi&#x27;s &quot;Muruj al-Dhahab&quot;, Ibn Ath&#x27;am&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Futuh&quot;, Shaykh al-Mufid&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot;, and Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani&#x27;s &quot;Maqatil al-Talibiyyin&quot;. Most of these sources took material from Abu Mikhnaf, in addition to some from the primary works of Awana, al-Mada&#x27;ini and Nasr ibn Muzahim.

Although Tabari and other early sources contain some miraculous stories, these sources are mainly historical and rational in nature, in contrast to the literature of later periods, which is mainly hagiographical in nature.

The Battle of Karbala was also reported by an early Christian source. A history by the Syriac Christian scholar Theophilus of Edessa, who was chief astrologer in the Abbasid court between 775 and 785, is partially preserved in a number of extant Christian chronicles, including those by Michael the Syrian and the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor. Theophilus&#x27;s history corroborates the death in battle of Husayn and most of his men at Karbala after suffering from thirst. But in contrast to all Muslim sources, which state that Husayn fought Yazid, Theophilus appears to have written that Husayn was killed by Muawiyah as the final engagement of the First Fitna between the Umayyads and Ali&#x27;s supporters.

==Historical analysis==
Based on an official report sent to caliph Yazid, which describes the battle very briefly, stating that it lasted for no longer than a siesta, Lammens concludes that there was no battle at all but a quick massacre that was over in an hour; he suggests that the detailed accounts found in the primary sources are Iraqi fabrications, since their writers were dissatisfied with their hero being killed without putting up a fight. This is countered by the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, who argues that despite there being some fabricated accounts, all of the contemporary accounts together form &quot;a coherent and credible narrative&quot;. She criticizes Lammens&#x27; hypothesis as being based on a single isolated report and being devoid of critical analysis. Similarly, Madelung and Wellhausen assert that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset and that the overall account of the battle is reliable. Vaglieri and Madelung explain the length of the battle despite the numerical disparity between the opposing camps as Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s attempt to prolong the fight and pressure Husayn into submission instead of attempting to quickly overwhelm and kill him.

According to Wellhausen, the compassion that Yazid showed to the family of Husayn, and his cursing of Ibn Ziyad was only for show. He argues that if killing Husayn was a crime its responsibility lay with Yazid and not Ibn Ziyad, who was only performing his duty. Madelung holds a similar view; according to him, early accounts place the responsibility for Husayn&#x27;s death on Ibn Ziyad instead of Yazid. Yazid, Madelung argues, wanted to end Husayn&#x27;s opposition, but as a caliph of Islam could not afford to be seen as publicly responsible and so diverted blame onto Ibn Ziyad by hypocritically cursing him. According to Howard, some traditional sources have a tendency to exonerate Yazid at the cost of Ibn Ziyad and lower authorities.

===Modern historical views on motivations of Husayn===
Wellhausen has described Husayn&#x27;s revolt as a premature and ill-prepared campaign by an ambitious person. He writes &quot;He reaches out to the moon like a child. He makes the greatest demands and does not do the slightest; the others should do everything... As soon as he encounters resistance, it is over with him; he wants to go back when it is too late.&quot; Lammens has agreed to this view and he sees in Husayn a person who disturbs public peace. According to Heinz Halm, this was a struggle for political leadership between the second generation of Muslims, in which the poorly equipped pretender ended up losing. Fred Donner, G. R. Hawting, and Hugh N. Kennedy see Husayn&#x27;s revolt as an attempt to regain what his brother Hasan had renounced.

Vaglieri, on the other hand, considers him to be motivated by ideology, saying that if the materials that have come down to us are authentic, they convey an image of person who is &quot;convinced that he was in the right, stubbornly determined to achieve his ends...&quot; Holding a similar view, Madelung has argued that Husayn was not a &quot;reckless rebel&quot; but a religious man motivated by pious convictions. According to him, Husayn was convinced that &quot;the family of the Prophet was divinely chosen to lead the community founded by Moḥammad, as the latter had been chosen, and had both an inalienable right and an obligation to seek this leadership.&quot; He was, however, not seeking martyrdom and wanted to return when his expected support did not materialize. Maria Dakake holds that Husayn considered the Umayyad rule oppressive and misguided, and revolted to reorient the Islamic community in the right direction. A similar view is held by Mahmoud Ayoub. S. M. Jafri proposes that Husayn, although motivated by ideology, did not intend to secure leadership for himself. Husayn, Jafri asserts, was from the start aiming for martyrdom in order to jolt the collective conscience of the Muslim community and reveal what he considers to be the oppressive and anti-Islamic nature of the Umayyad regime. M. Momen sides with Jafri, citing the reports that Husayn was warned about the collapse of the Shia revolt in Kufa. Instead of changing his course, however, he pressed on toward Kufa, urging his supporters to leave him and save their lives.

==Impact==

The killing of the grandson of Muhammad shocked the Muslim community. The image of Yazid suffered and gave rise to sentiment that he was impious. The event has had an emotional impact on Sunnis, who remember the event as a tragic incident and those killed in the company of Husayn as martyrs. The impact on Shi&#x27;a Islam has been much deeper.

===Shi&#x27;a Islam===
Prior to the Battle of Karbala, the Muslim community was divided into two political factions. Nonetheless, a religious sect with distinct theological doctrines and specific set of rituals had not developed. Karbala gave this early political party of pro-Alids a distinct religious identity and helped transform it into a distinct religious sect. Heinz Halm writes: &quot;There was no religious aspect to Shi&#x27;ism prior to 680. The death of the third imam and his followers marked the &#x27;big bang&#x27; that created the rapidly expanding cosmos of Shi&#x27;ism and brought it into motion.&quot;
Husayn&#x27;s death at Karbala is believed by Shi&#x27;as to be a sacrifice made to prevent the corruption of Islam by tyrannical rulers and to protect its ideology. He is, as such, believed to have been fully aware of his fate and the outcome of his revolt, which was divinely ordained. He is thus remembered as the prince of martyrs (&quot;Sayyed al-Shuhada&quot;). The historian G. R. Hawting describes the Battle of Karbala as a &quot;supreme&quot; example of &quot;suffering and martyrdom&quot; for Shi&#x27;as. According to Abdulaziz Sachedina, it is seen by Shi&#x27;as the climax of suffering and oppression, revenge for which came to be one of the primary goals of many Shi&#x27;a uprisings. This revenge is believed to be one of the fundamental objectives of the future revolution of the twelfth Shi&#x27;a Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, whose return is awaited. With his return, Husayn and his seventy-two companions are expected to be resurrected along with their killers, who will then be punished.

====Shi&#x27;a observances====

Shi&#x27;a Muslims consider pilgrimages to Husayn&#x27;s tomb to be a source of divine blessings and rewards. According to Shi&#x27;a tradition the first such visit was performed by Husayn&#x27;s son Ali Zayn al-Abidin and the surviving family members during their return from Syria to Medina. The first historically recorded visit is Sulayman ibn Surad and the Penitents going to Husayn&#x27;s grave before their departure to Syria. They are reported to have lamented and beaten their chests and to have spent a night by the tomb. Thereafter this tradition was limited to the Shi&#x27;a imams for several decades, before gaining momentum under the sixth Shi&#x27;a imam Jafar Sadiq and his followers. Buyids and Safavids also encouraged this practice. Special visits are paid on 10 Muharram (&quot;Ashura&quot; Pilgrimage) and 40 days after the anniversary of Husayn&#x27;s (&quot;Arba&#x27;een&quot; Pilgrimage). The soil of Karbala is considered to have miraculous healing effects.
Mourning for Husayn is considered by Shi&#x27;as to be a source of salvation in the afterlife, and is undertaken as a remembrance of his suffering. After the death of Husayn, when his family was being taken to Ibn Ziyad, Husayn&#x27;s sister Zaynab is reported to have cried out after seeing his headless body: &quot;O Muhammad!... Here is Husayn in the open, stained with blood and with limbs torn off. O Muhammad! Your daughters are prisoners, your progeny are killed, and the east wind blows dust over them.&quot; Shi&#x27;a Muslims consider this to be the first instance of wailing and mourning over the death of Husayn. Husayn&#x27;s son Zayn al-Abideen is reported to have spent the rest of his life weeping for his father. Similarly, Husayn&#x27;s mother Fatima is believed to be weeping for him in paradise and the weeping of believers is considered to be a way of sharing her sorrows. Special gatherings (&quot;majalis&quot;; sing. &quot;majlis&quot;) are arranged in places reserved for this purpose, called &quot;husayniyya&quot;. In these gatherings the story of Karbala is narrated and various elegies (&quot;rawda&quot;) are recited by professional reciters (&quot;rawda khwan&quot;).
During the month of Muharram, elaborate public processions are performed in commemoration of the Battle of Karbala. In contrast to pilgrimage to Husayn&#x27;s tomb and simple lamenting, these processions do not date back to the time of the battle, but arose during tenth century. Their earliest recorded instance was in Baghdad in 963 during the reign of the first Buyid ruler Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla. The processions start from a &quot;husayniyya&quot; and the participants parade barefoot through the streets, wailing and beating their chests and heads before returning to the &quot;husayniyya&quot; for a &quot;majlis&quot;. Sometimes, chains and knives are used to inflict wounds and physical pain. In South Asia, an ornately tacked horse called &quot;zuljanah&quot;, representing Husayn&#x27;s battle horse, is also led riderless through the streets. In Iran, the battle scenes of Karbala are performed on stage in front of an audience in a ritual called &quot;taziya&quot; (passion play), also known as &quot;shabih&quot;. In India however, &quot;taziya&quot; refers to the coffins and replicas of Husayn&#x27;s tomb carried in processions.

Most of these rituals take place during the first ten days of Muharram, reaching a climax on the tenth day, although &quot;majalis&quot; can also occur throughout the year. Occasionally, especially in the past, some Sunni participation in &quot;majalis&quot; and processions has been observed. According to Yitzhak Nakash, the rituals of Muharram have an &quot;important&quot; effect in the &quot;invoking the memory of Karbala&quot;, as these help consolidate the collective identity and memory of the Shi&#x27;a community. Anthropologist Michael Fischer states that commemoration of the Battle of Karbala by the Shi&#x27;a is not only the retelling of the story, but also presents them with &quot;life models and norms of behavior&quot; which are applicable to all aspects of life, which he calls the Karbala Paradigm. According to Olmo Gölz, the Karbala Paradigm provide Shi&#x27;as with heroic norms and a martyr ethos, and represents an embodiment of the battle between good and evil, justice and injustice. Rituals involving self-flagellation have been criticized by many Shi&#x27;a scholars as they are considered to be innovative practices damaging reputation of Shi&#x27;ism. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned the practice in Iran since 1994.

===Politics===
The first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of &quot;Revenge for Husayn&quot;. Although the Penitents had used the same slogan, they do not seem have had a political program. In order to enhance their legitimacy, Abbasid rulers claimed to have avenged the death of Husayn by dethroning the Umayyads. During the early years of their rule, they also encouraged Muharram rituals. Buyids, a Shi&#x27;a dynasty originally from Iran which later occupied the Abbasid capital Baghdad while accepting the Abbasid caliph&#x27;s suzerainty, promoted the public rituals of Muharram to portray themselves as patrons of religion and to strengthen the Shi&#x27;a identity in Iraq. After taking over Iran in 1501, Safavids, who were previously a Sufi order, declared the state religion to be Twelver Shi&#x27;ism. In this regard, Karbala and Muharram rituals came to be a vehicle of Safavid propaganda and a means of consolidating the dynasty&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a identity. Riza Yildirim has claimed that the impetus of the Safvid revolution was the revenge of the death of Husayn. The founder of the dynasty, Shah Ismail, considered himself to be the Mahdi (the twelfth Shi&#x27;a Imam) or his forerunner. Similarly, Qajars also patronized Muharram rituals such as processions, &quot;taziya&quot; and &quot;majalis&quot;, to improve the relationship between the state and the public.

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shi’ites in countries such as Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, have interpreted Husayn&#x27;s martyrdom at Karbala as symbolic of religious and political resistance against oppression in his era. In these countries, Shi’ites view Husayn as a role model in their daily lives, drawing inspiration for their religious and political resistance against perceived anti-Shia forces, whether domestic or international.

====Iranian revolution====
Karbala and Shi&#x27;a symbolism played a significant role in the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In contrast to the traditional view of Shi&#x27;ism as a religion of suffering, mourning and political quietism, Shi&#x27;a Islam and Karbala were given a new interpretation in the period preceding the revolution by rationalist intellectuals and religious revisionists like Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, Ali Shariati and Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi. According to these, Shi&#x27;ism was an ideology of revolution and political struggle against tyranny and exploitation, and the Battle of Karbala and the death of Husayn was to be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle; weeping and mourning was to be replaced by political activism to realize the ideals of Husayn.

After the White Revolution reforms of the Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which were opposed by the Iranian clergy and others, Ruhollah Khomeini labelled the Shah as the Yazid of his time. Condemning the Iranian monarchy, Khomeini wrote: &quot;The struggle of al-Husayn at Karbalâ is interpreted in the same way as a struggle against the non-Islamic principle of monarchy.&quot; Opposition to the Shah was thus compared with the opposition of Husayn to Yazid, and Muharram ritual gatherings became increasingly political in nature. According to Aghaie, the Shah&#x27;s hostility towards various Muharram rituals, which he considered to be uncivilized, contributed to his fall. The Islamic republic that was established after the revolution has since promoted Muharram rituals. The clerics encourage public participation in elections as a form of &quot;political activism&quot; comparable to that of Husayn. Martyrdom spirit influenced by the death of Husayn was frequently witnessed in Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq war.

==== Hezbollah ====
Lebanese Shi&#x27;ite organization Hezbollah compared Husayn&#x27;s fight against those who tried to kill him and his family to Hezbollah’s conflicts with Israel and the South Lebanon Army, asserting that Hezbollah operatives who died in martyrdom operations against them died glorious and heroic martyrs’ death.

==In literature and art==
South Asian philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal sees Husayn&#x27;s sacrifice as being similar to that of Ishmael and compares Yazid&#x27;s opposition to Husayn with the opposition of Pharaoh to Moses. Urdu poet Ghalib compares Husayn&#x27;s suffering with that of Mansur al-Hallaj, a tenth century Sufi, who was executed on a charge of claiming divinity.

===Maqtal literature and legendary accounts===
&quot;Maqtal&quot; (pl. &quot;Maqatil&quot;) works narrate the story of someone&#x27;s death. Although &quot;Maqatil&quot; on the deaths of Ali, Uthman and various others have been written, the &quot;Maqtal&quot; genre has focused mainly on the story of Husayn&#x27;s death.

As well as Abu Mikhnaf&#x27;s &quot;Maqtal&quot;, other Arabic &quot;Maqatil&quot; on Husayn were written. Most of these mix history with legend and have elaborate details on Husayn&#x27;s miraculous birth, which is stated to be on 10 Muharram, coinciding with his date of death. The universe as well as humanity are described as having been created on the day of &quot;Ashura&quot; (10 Muharram). &quot;Ashura&quot; is also asserted to have been the day of both Abraham&#x27;s and Muhammad&#x27;s birth and of the ascension of Jesus to heaven, and of numerous other events concerning prophets. Husayn is claimed to have performed various miracles, including quenching his companions&#x27; thirst by putting his thumb in their mouths and satisfying their hunger by bringing down food from the heavens, and to have killed several thousand Umayyad attackers. Other accounts claim that when Husayn died, his horse shed tears and killed many Umayyad soldiers; the sky became red and it rained blood; angels, jinns and wild animals wept; that light emanated from Husayn&#x27;s severed head and that it recited the Qur&#x27;an; and that all of his killers met calamitous end.

&quot;Maqtal&quot; later entered Persian, Turkish, and Urdu literature, and inspired the development of &quot;rawda&quot;.

===Marthiya and rawda===
When Shi&#x27;ism became the official religion of Iran in the 16th century, Safavid rulers such as Shah Tahmasp I, patronized poets who wrote about the Battle of Karbala. The genre of &quot;marthiya&quot; (poems in the memory of the dead, with popular forms of Karbala related &quot;marthiya&quot; being &quot;rawda&quot; and &quot;nawha&quot;), according to Persian scholar Wheeler Thackston, &quot;was particularly cultivated by the Safavids.&quot; Various Persian authors wrote texts retelling romanticized and synthesized versions of the battle and events from it, including Sa&#x27;id al-Din&#x27;s &quot;Rawdat al-Islam&quot; (The Garden of Islam) and Al-Khawarazmi&#x27;s &quot;Maqtal nur &#x27;al-&#x27;a&#x27;emmah&quot; (The Site of the Murder of the Light of the Imams). These influenced the composition of the more popular text &quot;Rawdat al-Shuhada&quot; (Garden of Martyrs), which was written in 1502 by Husain Wa&#x27;iz Kashefi. Kashefi&#x27;s composition was an effective factor in the development of &quot;rawda khwani&quot;, a ritual recounting of the battle events in &quot;majalis&quot;.

Inspired by &quot;Rawdat al-Shuhada&quot;, the Azerbaijani poet Fuzûlî wrote an abridged and simplified version of it in Ottoman Turkish in his work &quot;Hadiqat al-Su&#x27;ada&quot;. It influenced similar works in Albanian on the subject. Dalip Frashëri&#x27;s &quot;Kopshti i te Mirevet&quot; is the earliest, and longest epic so far, written in the Albanian language; the Battle of Karbala is described in detail and Frashëri eulogizes those who fell as martyrs, in particular Husayn.

Urdu &quot;marthiya&quot; is predominantly religious in nature and usually concentrates on lamenting the Battle of Karbala. South Indian rulers of Bijapur (Ali Adil Shah), and Golkonda Sultanate (Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah) were patrons of poetry and encouraged Urdu &quot;marthiya&quot; recitation in Muharram. Urdu &quot;marthiya&quot; afterwards became popular throughout India. Famous Urdu poets Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Rafi Sauda, Mir Anees, and Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer have also composed &quot;marthiya&quot;. Comparing Karl Marx with Husayn, Josh Malihabadi argues that Karbala is not a story of the past to be recounted by the religious clerics in &quot;majalis&quot;, but should be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle towards the goal of a classless society and economic justice.

===Sufi poetry===
In Sufism, where annihilation of the self (&quot;nafs&quot;) and suffering in the path of God are paramount principles, Husayn is seen as a model Sufi. Persian Sufi poet Hakim Sanai describes Husayn as a martyr, higher in rank than all the other martyrs of the world; while Farid ud-Din Attar considers him a prototype of a Sufi who sacrificed himself in the love of God. Jalal ud-Din Rumi describes Husayn&#x27;s suffering at Karbala as a means to achieve union with the divine, and hence considers it to be a matter of jubilation rather than grief. Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai devoted a section in his &quot;Shah Jo Risalo&quot; to the death of Husayn, in which the incident is remembered in laments and elegies. He too sees Husayn&#x27;s death as a sacrifice made in the path of God, and condemns Yazid as being bereft of divine love. Turkish Sufi Yunus Emre labels Husayn, along with his brother Hasan, as the &quot;fountain head of the martyrs&quot; and &quot;Kings of the Paradise&quot; in his songs.

===Paintings and murals===
Although the Islamic clergy has been disapproving of pictorial representation of early figures of Islam, the popularity of the &quot;taziya&quot; passion plays in Iran facilitated public acceptance of such representations in the form of paintings depicting battle scenes. The paintings, called &quot;shamayel&quot; or &quot;parda&quot;, originated in the Qajar era and were not intended as professional works of high art, but rather as popular representations for the &quot;taziya&quot; scenes. The &quot;cartoon style&quot; paintings usually depict multiple battle scenes on a single canvas as well as scenes from the hereafter showing Husayn and his supporters enjoying in the paradise and their enemies burning in hell. They are often used to decorate &quot;husayniyyas&quot;. The &quot;shamayel&quot; subsequently gave rise to murals when scenes started to be painted directly on walls.

<doc id="402600" wikidata="Q5471700" url="?curid=402600" title="Fort Mojave Indian Reservation">
<text>The Fort Mohave Indian Reservation is an Indian reservation along the Colorado River, currently encompassing in Arizona, in California, and in the southernmost point of Nevada. Located around the tri-point of the three states, the reservation is home to approximately 1,100 members of the federally recognized Fort Mojave Indian Tribe of Arizona, California, and Nevada (), a federally recognized tribe of Mohave people.

Native Americans occupy less than 50 percent of the Mojave reservation. The Mohave people have leased much of their land to cotton, maize, and soybean farming companies, which employ a large population of resident white and Mexican Americans.

The site of the former Fort Mohave and the eastern terminus of the Mojave Road are situated within the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation.

==History==
These lands were occupied for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of Indigenous peoples. The property covers areas along the Colorado River of the three adjacent states of Arizona, California, and Nevada. It also is sporadically traversed by the Mojave River in California.

The Fort Mohave Indian Reservation was established in 1890, and comprised the land of the former camp Mojave military reservation, thereby transferring it from the War Department to the Office of Indian Affairs. For decades until the early 1930s, it operated an Indian boarding school for Native American students from the Mohave and other tribes, as part of efforts to assimilate youth to the mainstream culture. They were forced to speak English and practice Christianity while at the school. The property was transferred to the reservation in 1935. It has allowed the buildings to deteriorate, as they were symbolic of a painful period in relations with the US.

==Economy==
The Mojave have leased considerable amounts of reservation land to agricultural companies for cultivation of commodity crops: soybeans, corn, and alfalfa. Many white and Mexican American workers live here, with less than 50% of the reservation occupied by Mohave and other Native Americans.

From 1995 the tribe operates the Avi Resort &amp; Casino in Nevada. On October 20, 2003, the reservation government announced an agreement between the reservation and California Governor Gray Davis to allow the operation of a casino west of Needles, California (directly across the Colorado River from the Tribe&#x27;s Arizona Reservation Lands).

==Language revitalization==
As of 2012, The Center for Indian Education at Arizona State University &quot;has facilitated &quot;workshops for both learners and speakers at the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation in northwest Arizona, California and Nevada. Fort Mojave has about 22 elders who speak some Mojave.&quot; The project is also bringing elders together with younger people to teach the traditional Mojave &quot;bird songs.&quot;

The language preservation work of poet Natalie Diaz on the reservation was featured on the PBS NewsHour in March 2012.

==Location==
The Fort Mojave Indian Reservation is located at .

==Education==
The portion of the reservation in California is served by the Needles Unified School District and the portion in Nevada by the Clark County School District. For elementary education in Arizona, one of the portions served by the Bullhead City Elementary School District and the other by the Mohave Valley Elementary School District. Both portions in Arizona are served by the Colorado River Union High School District for secondary education.

<doc id="402601" wikidata="Q2227089" url="?curid=402601" title="Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (1748–1814)">
<text>Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (; 1748 – 27 April 1814) ruled the First Saudi State from 1803 to 1814. Saud annexed Mecca and Medina from the Ottoman Empire making him the first Al Saud ruler who received the title of the servant of the Two Holy Cities. During his rule the state experienced a significant level of strength and expansion for which he was called Saud Al Kabeer or Saud the Great. 

==Early life==
Saud was born in Diriyah in 1748. He was the eldest son of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad. The mother of Saud was a daughter of Uthman bin Mu&#x27;ammar, ruler of Uyaina.

Saud&#x27;s succession was decided and announced in 1787. Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, religious leader of the state, asked people to express their allegiance to him as heir apparent. It was Abdul Wahhab&#x27;s last significant function in affairs of state. From early age Saud began to act as the chief military commander of the Emirate together with his uncle, Abdullah bin Muhammad, who was the father of Turki bin Abdullah, the founder of the Emirate of Nejd or the Second Saudi State. Saud led the forces of the Emirate in 1789 and conquered Al Hasa region defeating the army of the Bani Khalid Emirate who had been the ruler of the region. Although the rule of Bani Khalid Emir, Abdul Muhsin bin Abdullah Al Hamid, was ended by them, the Emirate could not completely capture the eastern Arabia. When Abdul Muhsin was killed by his tribe members in 1791, Saud again attacked them and won a victory eliminating the dominance of Bani Khalid in the region in 1792. 

In April 1802 Saud led an army with 12,000 Wahhabis and attacked Karbala destroying the tomb of Imam Hussain bin Ali, a grandson of Muhammad. In addition, they stole valuable materials in the tomb and killed the inhabitants of the city. Following the incident Saud sent a message to the Ottoman governor in Iraq stating: &quot;As for your statement that we seized Karbala, slaughtered its people, and took their possessions — praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds! We make no apology for that, and we say: &#x27;And like catastrophes await the unbelievers&#x27; [Quran 47:10].&quot;

==Reign==
The reign of Saud bin Abdulaziz began in 1803. Upon his accession to the throne he held the titles of both Emir and Imam like his father.

Saud&#x27;s reign was a period of religious cleansing in Arabia and in nearby regions. He continued to attack on shrines in Iraq, and Basra was blockaded by his forces for twelve days. The Emirate extended its rule beyond Najd and into the Hijaz which culminated with the capture of Medina in April 1804 and Mecca in 1806. In addition to capturing Hijaz he managed to strengthen his authority there. Furthermore, Bahrain and Oman were annexed to the Emirate, and Saud exerted his influence in Yemen. In 1805 Saud&#x27;s supremacy was also recognized by the rulers of Qawasim and Muscat, and Saud managed to capture a part of Oman. The same year he also annexed the Buraimi Oasis.

Saud&#x27;s forces transformed the Kaaba in Mecca and destroyed the tombs of numerous religious figures in Medina in accordance with Wahhabi theology. Due to the differences between Saud and the Ottomans in terms of the interpretation of Islam Saud ordered not to mention the name of the Ottoman sultan in Friday prayers in Mecca. Following the capture of Mecca he sent a letter to Ottoman Sultan Selim III, inviting him to follow the Wahhabi theology. In the same letter he declared that he had captured Mecca and destroyed all tombs there and that he would not let people from Damascus and Cairo to visit Mecca &quot;with the Mahmal and with trumpet and drums.&quot;

In 1807 Saud did not permit pilgrims from Egypt, Syria and Istanbul to enter Hijaz and expelled Turkish soldiers and settlers from Mecca. Such religious transformations did not sit well with other Muslims, and many other Muslims found his actions to be extreme, and were stunned that the holy cities had been taken so easily. The Ottoman Empire did not want to relent control over the cities to local tribesmen. The Ottomans could not retake the cities on their own though as the bulk of their forces were tied up in Europe. Muhammad Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, was assigned to recapture the Arabian territories in 1809. One of his sons, commanding the Egyptian troops, succeeded in re-conquering Hijaz in 1813.

==Personal life and death==
Saud had a very different personality than his father, who was a deeply religious figure. He was interested in material side of the rule. However, like his grandfather and father he dressed in a plain way, and his armaments were not decorated unlike those of the Mamluk and Ottoman rulers. He died in Diriyya on 27 April 1814 due to fever and was succeeded by his eldest son Abdullah. 

Saud&#x27;s other sons included Mishari, Turki, Nasser and Saad. His youngest son, Khalid, ruled the Emirate of Nejd or the Second Saudi State from 1838 to 1841 with the support of the Ottomans. Three of Saud&#x27;s sons were killed in the siege of Diriyah by Ibrahim Pasha, who also arrested Saud&#x27;s successor, Abdullah bin Saud. Mishari bin Saud returned to Diriyah in 1819 and attempted to establish his rule, but Mohammed bin Mishari bin Muammar who began to rule the region after the collapse of the Emirate imprisoned him.

<doc id="402607" wikidata="Q505423" url="?curid=402607" title="Jerry Rice">
<text>Jerry Lee Rice (born October 13, 1962) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played for 20 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He won three Super Bowl titles with the San Francisco 49ers before two shorter stints at the end of his career with the Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks. For his accomplishments and numerous records, Rice is widely regarded as the greatest wide receiver of all time and one of the greatest players in NFL history. His biography on the official Pro Football Hall of Fame website names him &quot;the most prolific wide receiver in NFL history with staggering career totals&quot;. In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; listed Rice second behind Jim Brown on its list of &quot;Football&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. In 2010, he was chosen by NFL Network&#x27;s NFL Films production &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot; as the greatest player in NFL history.

Rice played college football for four seasons with the Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils, setting several National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and team receiving records, including becoming the all-time leader in NCAA receiving touchdowns. He joined the 49ers after being selected with the 16th overall pick of the 1985 NFL draft. After a modest rookie season, Rice emerged in the following season as one of the best receivers in the league, leading the NFL in receiving yards and touchdowns, a feat he achieved four times. In 1987, Rice set the record for most receiving touchdowns in a season, with 22, in a twelve-game strike-shortened season. He won back-to-back championships in 1988 and 1989, and was the MVP of the former championship. Rice developed connections with quarterbacks Joe Montana and Steve Young that are viewed as among the best in NFL history, helping him lead the league in both receiving yards and touchdowns six times, and in receptions twice.

Going into the 1990s, Rice won a third Super Bowl in 1994, and a second Offensive Player of the Year Award. After recovering from a knee injury and his play regressing, San Francisco released him in June 2001, where the Raiders would sign him to a four-year deal. He continued to start for the team, and helped lead them to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVII, where they were defeated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, affecting Rice&#x27;s previously unblemished Super Bowl record. Midway through 2004, the Raiders traded him to the Seahawks, where he spent his final season. He briefly signed with the Broncos, retiring shortly before the start of the 2005 season.

Rice is the career leader in most major statistical categories for wide receivers, including receptions, receiving touchdowns, receiving yards, scrimmage yards, and total touchdowns, holding the postseason records for these statistics, and once held the single-season records for yards and touchdowns. He scored more points than any other non-kicker in NFL history with 1,256. Rice was selected to the Pro Bowl 13 times (1986–1996, 1998, 2002) and named All-Pro twelve times in his 20 NFL seasons, including ten First-team All-Pros, tied for the most by any player. Rice was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006. Rice was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 2007, and in the same year was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame. The NFL honored him as a member of the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team and the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team, as well as both the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team and NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

== Early life ==
Jerry Lee Rice Sr. was born on October 13, 1962, in Starkville, Mississippi, and lived in Crawford, Mississippi, the sixth of eight children. Crawford was a small town, having only 600 residents. Rice&#x27;s father, Joe, was a brick mason who built houses by hand, while holding other jobs to provide for the family. Joe was described by Rice as &quot;a tough man&quot; and held him and his siblings to a strict lifestyle. Eddie B., Rice&#x27;s mother, raised Rice while Joe was working, and after Rice left cleaned the houses of wealthy families. Rice and his brothers often worked with their father building houses, catching bricks on top of scaffolds to make sure his father had bricks to lay. He did not see bricklaying as being his future saying that &quot;it taught me the meaning of hard work.&quot; The Rice family struggled financially, with Rice sometimes not having many pairs of clothing or having a &quot;hearty meal on the table&quot;. Providing for his family, he and his brothers picked corn, cotton, carrots, and hay. Rice asserted that he was shy as a child and did not have many friends.

Rice attended B. L. Moor High School in Oktoc, Mississippi. Although he played mock games of basketball and football, Rice initially played no sports in high school. He enjoyed playing sandlot football and watching football on television. His mother didn&#x27;t allow him to join the school&#x27;s football team in his freshman year, as she thought that football was &quot;too rough&quot; for Rice. While Rice was a sophomore, the school&#x27;s assistant principal caught him skipping class with a friend, causing him to panic and sprint away. After Rice fled, the principal was impressed with his speed, and informed the school&#x27;s football coach, Charles Davis, who offered Rice a place on the team. Initially unhappy about this, Rice&#x27;s mother relented after realizing that &quot;the more I fought it, the more determined he was, so I gave it up.&quot; Rice played basketball as a forward and was on the track and field team, competing in the high jump. He played multiple positions in high school including running back, defensive back and tight end. The position he was most skilled at was wide receiver. During the off-season before his junior year, he increased his training; running several miles back to his house because he didn&#x27;t have a ride. Rice had a breakout junior season, primarily playing wide receiver and defensive back.

Rice was a Mississippi All-State selection at wide receiver in his senior year. Due to the small size of Moor, few of his statistics were officially recorded. According to sports journalist Glenn Dickey, Rice caught 50 receptions and 30 touchdowns as a senior, helping to lead the team to a record over his final two seasons. He and Moor&#x27;s starting quarterback, Willie Gillespie, were very dependable, enough for them to be nicknamed Johnny Unitas and Raymond Berry. Rice initially wanted to go to Mississippi State University, but the team wasn&#x27;t interested in him. Mississippi State was one of over 40 NCAA Division I-A schools which contacted him, but did not offer a scholarship. He was drawn to Mississippi Valley State, in part because the school&#x27;s coach, Archie Cooley, ran a pass-heavy offense—enough that Cooley was nicknamed &quot;The Gunslinger.&quot; After Cooley watched Rice play in person and after he visited the school&#x27;s campus, Rice committed to playing at Mississippi Valley State.

==College career==

Rice attended Mississippi Valley State University from 1981 to 1984. When Rice arrived at Mississippi Valley State, he attended summer school and freshman orientation before the regular season. Two of his former teammates from B.L. Moor were there as well, but both left before the start of training camp. Rice studied receiving techniques from Gloster Richardson, stating: &quot;I soaked up everything I could.&quot;

In 1981, Rice&#x27;s freshman season, he caught 30 passes for 428 yards and two touchdowns. In 1982, Rice played his first season with freshman quarterback Willie Totten. They became friends and practiced into the evening. Under the direction of Cooley, Mississippi Valley State ran an &quot;unusual&quot; offense, playing four wide receivers who tended to line up on one side of the field. Rice caught 66 passes for 1,133 yards and seven touchdowns as a sophomore that year. Together, Totten and Rice became known as &quot;The Satellite Express.&quot; Success on the field did not put any money in his pocket, and many times he relied on friends for food, stating that the food given to him at Mississippi Valley &quot;were not enough for a growing man&quot;.

Rice had a record-setting 1983 campaign, including NCAA marks for receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,450). He was named a first-team Division I-AA All-American. He set a single-game NCAA record with 24 receptions against Southern University. He acquired the nickname &quot;World,&quot; because of his ability to seemingly catch anything thrown near him.

After an August practice experiment, Cooley had Totten call all the plays at the line of scrimmage without a huddle, resulting in even more staggering offensive numbers. Rice caught 17 receptions for 199 yards against Southern, 17 receptions for 294 yards, and five receiving touchdowns against Kentucky State, and 15 for 285 yards against Jackson State. During the game against Kentucky State, Rice caught twelve passes and scored three touchdowns in a single quarter. As a senior in 1984, he surpassed his own Division I-AA records for receiving yards (1,845), and receptions (112); his 27 touchdown receptions in the 1984 season set the NCAA record for every division. The 1984 Delta Devils averaged more than 60 points per game. Rice was named to the Division I-AA All-American team and finished ninth in Heisman Trophy balloting in 1984.

In the Blue–Gray Classic all-star game played on Christmas Day, he earned MVP honors after four receptions for 101 yards and a 60-yard touchdown. He finished his career with 301 catches for 4,693 yards and 50 touchdowns, (although some sources have his numbers as 310 receptions, 4,856 receiving yards, and 51 touchdowns); his NCAA record for total career touchdown receptions stood until 2006 when New Hampshire wide receiver David Ball recorded his 51st career receiving touchdown. Rice&#x27;s all-division NCAA record for total career receptions stood until 1999 when Scott Pingel of Division III Westminster logged his 302nd career reception. By the end of his college career, he had broken 18 NCAA records. Rice became a member of the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity at the Delta Phi chapter. In 1999, the school renamed its football stadium from Magnolia Stadium to Rice–Totten Stadium in honor of the players. Rice was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006, and was in the inaugural class of the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2010.

During this time, Rice met Jackie Mitchell at an MVS basketball game, while she was still in high school. Rice eventually approached her, and they dated casually before Rice met her mother. Her mother was initially unhappy about Rice and preferred that Mitchell see another boy that lived in Greenville, Mississippi, but after meeting Rice in person she approved of him.

==Professional career==

===San Francisco 49ers (1985–2000)===
Rice&#x27;s record-breaking season at Mississippi Valley State caught the attention of NFL scouts. Sources vary on his 40-yard dash time, which was measured between 4.45 and 4.71 seconds. Both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers showed interest in him. San Francisco had won two out of the previous four Super Bowls prior to the draft. Rice later wrote in &quot;Go Long!&quot; that he was unsure about what success he might have in the league, and that he would &quot;often play head games&quot; with himself; his backup plan if his football career didn&#x27;t pan out was fixing electronics. In a 2022 interview with Fox News Digital, Rice expressed his doubts about being drafted at the time: &quot;To be honest, I never thought I was going to get drafted, I downplayed everything because I didn&#x27;t want that disappointment of getting up here and then come down in disappointment if it didn&#x27;t happen&quot;.

In the first round of the 1985 NFL draft, Dallas had the No. 17 selection and San Francisco, as Super Bowl champion from the previous season, had the last. 49ers coach Bill Walsh sought Rice after seeing television highlights of his college performances. Walsh &quot;saw the deep-threat the 49ers lacked ... a player who could break open a game with one play.&quot; The 49ers traded their first, second, and third-round picks for the New England Patriots&#x27; first and third-round picks. The 49ers had the No. 16 selection overall and drafted Rice before the Cowboys had a chance. Walsh described Rice as &quot;a swift, smooth player who&#x27;s got great instincts running with the ball, going to the ball and catching in a crowd.&quot; Rice was selected by the United States Football League (USFL), where the Birmingham Stallions selected him with the No. 1 overall pick of the 1985 USFL Draft, but the league folded after its 1986 season. In training camp, Rice had to compete with 49ers Dwight Clark and Freddie Solomon for roster spots at the wide receiver position.

==== Joe Montana and first two Super Bowls (1985–1989) ====
In July 1985, Rice was one of 21 rookie players who had not yet signed a contract. Rice signed a rookie contract for five years that paid him $377,000 per year. He wrote that during training camp, he was nicknamed &quot;Fifi&quot; because of his haircut, but he was praised by his teammates for his work ethic. It was with the 49ers where Rice switched from his college number, 88 (which was already taken by teammate Freddie Solomon), to his now famous #80 (in honor of his idol, Steve Largent). Rice made his NFL debut in the 49ers&#x27; regular season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. He had four receptions for 67 yards in the 28–21 loss. Rice scored his first receiving touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons on a 25-yard reception from Joe Montana in Week 5. Rice had a breakout game with ten receptions for a then franchise-record 241 yards against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 13, his first over 100 receiving yards, with San Francisco losing 27–20. For his game against the Rams, Rice earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After a seven reception, 111-yard performance in a 31–16 victory in the regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, while scoring a rushing touchdown, CBS announcer Pat Summerall stated that &quot;When this guy [Rice] is finished [retires], he&#x27;ll be considered one of the greatest wide receivers to ever play this game.&quot; He recorded 49 catches, for 927 yards, and three receiving touchdowns, averaging 18.9 yards per catch in his rookie season, and started four out of sixteen possible games. United Press International (UPI) named Rice the NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year, and he was selected to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. Nevertheless, Rice struggled, dropping numerous passes that season. In a game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Rice dropped two wide-open passes and later fumbled on an 8-yard pass that was intended to boost Rice&#x27;s confidence. Rice said that his poor play may have been impacted by his increased wealth and the distractions that came with it. The 49ers finished the regular season with a record and made the postseason. During the Wild Card Round against the New York Giants, Rice had four receptions for 44 yards in the 17–3 loss.

During the 1986 off-season, Rice spent much of his time studying the 49ers playbook. Playing against the Los Angeles Rams, Rice had six receptions for 157 yards and a touchdown in a Week 2 loss. He followed that with a seven reception, 120-yard game against the New Orleans Saints in a 26–17 victory in Week 3. Following a two-touchdown game against the Miami Dolphins in Week 4, Rice had six receptions for 172 yards and three touchdowns in a 35–14 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In Week 10, against the St. Louis Cardinals, he had four receptions for 156 receiving yards and three touchdowns in the 43–17 victory. Rice had his second career 200-yard receiving game against the Washington Redskins, having a 12 reception, 204-yard performance in Week 11. For his game against Washington, he won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. He won NFC Offensive Player of the Month for November. Overall, he caught 86 passes for 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns, both of which led the league, the first of four seasons in which Rice led the NFL in both receiving yards and touchdown receptions. He was named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams. The 49ers finished the regular season with a 10–5–1 record, won the NFC West, and made the postseason. Rice struggled in the Divisional Round against the eventual Super Bowl-winning Giants, fumbling what would have been a long touchdown on the game&#x27;s first drive. The 49ers lost 49–3.

In the first game of the 1987 season, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rice went for eight receptions and 108 yards with a touchdown in a 30–17 loss. The following week against the Cincinnati Bengals, Rice recorded four receptions for 86 yards and two touchdowns in a 27–26 victory. The NFL Players Association began a strike after the season&#x27;s second game, causing Rice to miss the next four games while backups replaced him (including a canceled game). He picketed outside the 49ers practice facility while some of his teammates (including quarterback Joe Montana and halfback Roger Craig), crossed picket lines to play. When the strike ended, Rice resumed playing in Week 7. In Week 10, against the New Orleans Saints, he had four receptions for 108 yards and two touchdowns in the 26–24 loss. In the following game, a 24–10 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had seven receptions for 103 yards and three receiving touchdowns in the 24–10 victory. His continued his productive streak with seven receptions for 126 yards and three touchdowns in a 38–24 victory over the Cleveland Browns in the following game. For his game against the Browns, he won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Two weeks later, in Week 14, Rice recorded three receiving touchdowns for the third time in four games in a 41–0 victory over the Chicago Bears. In the final two games of the regular season, Rice recorded four total receiving touchdowns. Rice scored a receiving touchdown in every game he played that season. In total, he scored 22 receiving touchdowns in 12 games, coupled with 1,078 receiving yards from 65 receptions. His touchdown number broke a then-NFL-record previously held by Mark Clayton (18), which Rice officially broke against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 15. The record was broken by Randy Moss in 2007, when he scored 23 receiving touchdowns. After being selected to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams, Rice was awarded the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award, becoming the first wide receiver to receive the award. He was also named the NFLs MVP by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. In 1987, the touchdown runner-up was receiver Mike Quick with 11, marking the first time in post-NFL–AFL merger history that a category leader doubled the total of his nearest competitor and the second time in the history of the NFL from its inception; the first being Don Hutson in 1942. The 49ers finished the season 13–2,the best record in the NFL, but lost in the Divisional Playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings 36–24, with Rice having three receptions for 28 yards.

Before the 1988 season, Rice signed a five-year, $5.05 million contract in June that kept him with the 49ers through 1992. He was plagued by an ankle injury throughout the season, In Week 3, Rice had eight receptions for 163 yards in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons. In the following game, he recorded 163 receiving yards once again and had three touchdowns in a 38–7 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. In Week 13, he had six receptions for 171 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in a 48–10 victory over the San Diego Chargers. He won NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Chargers. He still put up high numbers in the games he played, finishing the season with 64 receptions for 1,306 yards and nine receiving touchdowns, averaging a career-high 20.4 yards per reception, earning him more selections to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams. The 49ers won the NFC West with a 10–6 record. Rice had five receptions for 61 yards and three touchdowns, scoring all three in the first half of the 49er&#x27;s 34–9 win against the Vikings during the Divisional Round. In the 49ers&#x27; 28–3 win over the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship, he had five receptions for 133 yards and two touchdowns. In Super Bowl XXIII, Rice had an 11 reception, 215-yard performance with a touchdown, helping the 49ers to a narrow 20–16 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Both his receptions and receiving yards were Super Bowl records. For his performance, Rice was named the Super Bowl MVP; he called the win &quot;stupendous&quot;. He became the third wide receiver to earn Super Bowl MVP honors. Even though Rice won the MVP, Montana uttered the famous: &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World!&quot; line, instead of Rice; Rice attributed him not saying it to racism. Overall, Rice caught 21 receptions for 409 yards and six touchdowns; his yards and touchdown numbers stood as postseason records until Larry Fitzgerald broke both of them in 2008.

After the 1988 season, 49ers head coach Bill Walsh retired from coaching after much speculation, and was to be replaced by George Seifert; Rice was saddened by this, referring to Walsh his &quot;West Coast father&quot;. Rice started off the season strong with six receptions for 163 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in a 30–24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In the following game, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had eight receptions for 122 receiving yards in the 20–16 victory. In the next game, a 38–28 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a season-high 164 receiving yards on six receptions for two touchdowns. Two weeks later, he had seven receptions for 149 receiving yards and a touchdown in a 24–20 victory over the New Orleans Saints in Week 5. Starting in Week 7, Rice had a six-game stretch where he had three games with two receiving touchdowns and three games going over the 100-yard mark. By the end of the 1989 season, Rice had gained 82 receptions for 1,483 yards and 17 receiving touchdowns; both his yards and touchdown numbers led the league. For the fourth straight season, Rice was selected to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro team. San Francisco finished the regular season with a 14–2 record, the league&#x27;s best. Rice had six receptions for 114 yards and two touchdowns in the Divisional Round against the Minnesota Vikings; the 49ers won 41–13. In the NFC Championship against the Los Angeles Rams, he had six receptions for 55 yards in the 30–3 victory. Rice finished Super Bowl XXIV with seven receptions for 148 yards and three touchdowns in the 49ers 55–10 blowout victory against the Denver Broncos.

==== Steve Young years (1990–1994) ====

In the 1990 season, Rice started all 16 games. In Week 3, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 171 yards and a touchdown in the 19–13 victory. For his game against the Falcons, he won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. On October 14, in Week 6 against the Falcons, Rice caught a career-best five touchdowns to go with 13 receptions for 225 yards in the 45–35 victory. For the second time and against the same opponent in the 1990 season, Rice won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. On November 4, against the Green Bay Packers, Rice had a six reception, 181-yard performance with a touchdown. In the following game, against the Dallas Cowboys, he had 12 receptions for 147 yards and one touchdown in the 24–6 victory. In three of the last four games of the regular season, Rice went over 100 receiving yards. Rice had a successful year, leading the NFL in receptions (100), receiving yards (1,502), and receiving touchdowns (13), becoming the first player to lead the NFL in all three categories in the Super Bowl era: only Sterling Sharpe (1992), Steve Smith Sr. (2005), and Cooper Kupp (2021) have managed the feat since. He was named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams. Rice&#x27;s efforts helped San Francisco finish the year with an NFL-best 14–2 record. During the Divisional Round against the Redskins, Rice had six receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown in the 28–10 victory. Montana injured his elbow in the NFC Championship against the New York Giants, ending with the 49ers losing 15–13, failing to repeat as NFC champions for a third time; Rice went for five receptions and 54 yards in the game.

In 1991, Montana was ruled out for the season with an injury, making Steve Young the starting quarterback. Along with Montana, teammates Ronnie Lott and Roger Craig had left in free agency, making Rice &quot;the last of the Mohicans&quot; as he described himself, the only remaining star player from San Francisco&#x27;s 80s dynasty. Rice started the season with six receiving touchdowns in the first four games, which included a 150-yard game against the San Diego Chargers in Week 2. In Week 7, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had seven receptions for 138 yards and one touchdown in the 39–34 loss. Rice recorded 80 receptions for 1,206 yards and led the league in receiving touchdowns with 14 in the 1991 season, and was again selected to the Pro Bowl. He suffered a torn posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) against the Vikings, but the injury did not cost him any games. San Francisco managed to win their final six games to finish with a 10–6 record but they failed to make the postseason, marking the first time in Rice&#x27;s career that the 49ers failed to do so.

During the 1992 season, a quarterback controversy swirled around Montana and Young. Rice openly supported Montana, but Young ended up starting, while Montana rehabbed. Wanting a high-value contract, Rice skipped training camp. He eventually signed with the 49ers for a three-year, $7.5 million contract, returning to training camp. On September 13, Rice was knocked unconscious against the Buffalo Bills, and was taken out of the game with a concussion. In Week 7, against the Falcons, Rice had a seven reception, 183-yard performance with two touchdowns to go along with a 26-yard touchdown rush, totaling 209 scrimmage yards in the 56–17 victory. He won NFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game against the Falcons. In Week 13 against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had eight receptions for 133 receiving yards and one touchdown in the 20–14 victory. He won NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Eagles. Rice surpassed Steve Largent&#x27;s career receiving touchdown record on December 6 in a Week 14 game against the Miami Dolphins, scoring his 101st touchdown. In Week 16 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had seven receptions for 118 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 21–14 victory. Overall, Rice finished the season with 84 catches for 1,201 yards and ten touchdowns, and was once again named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro team. Rice helped the 49ers to an NFL-best 14–2 record, and they made the postseason. San Francisco won in the Divisional Round against the Redskins, but lost in the NFC Championship against the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys, being unable to stop the offense of Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. Rice had eight receptions for 123 yards and a touchdown in the game, with the touchdown being his 13th of his postseason career, an NFL record.

After the 1992 season, in April 1993, Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs; Rice wasn&#x27;t able to properly say goodbye to him, and believed that San Francisco should have &quot;treated Joe with more class&quot; when they traded him. In Week 8, Rice had a 155-yard performance with two receiving touchdowns against the Phoenix Cardinals. In Week 11, Rice had eight receptions for 172 yards and four touchdowns against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 45–21 victory. For his game against Tampa Bay, he won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Two weeks later, he had eight receptions for 166 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 35–10 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 16, he had four receptions for 132 receiving yards and one touchdown in the 55–17 victory over the Detroit Lions. Rice caught 98 receptions for 1,503 yards and 15 touchdowns in the 1993 season; both his receiving yards and touchdown numbers led the league. He was awarded his second career NFL Offensive Player of The Year Award, along with being selected to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams. San Francisco finished the season 10–6, and made the postseason. Rice and the 49ers won in the Divisional Round against the New York Giants, but once again lost in the NFC Championship against the Dallas Cowboys; Rice recorded nine receptions for 126 yards during the 1993 postseason.

While he didn&#x27;t get along with free agent addition Deion Sanders, he believed Sanders would help in the 49ers&#x27; pursuit of the Super Bowl. These assertions were proven correct, as Rice made it back to the Super Bowl with the 49ers in 1994, recording 112 receptions for 1,499 yards and 13 touchdowns, with Sanders winning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award. The season began against the Los Angeles Raiders, where he had a seven reception, 169-yard game with two touchdowns (rushing for one more), moving into first place in the NFL records for career touchdowns, with 127. On September 18 against the Rams, his 147 receiving yards from 11 catches moved him past Art Monk as the NFLs active leader in that category and past Charlie Joiner for third all-time. In Week 12, in another game against the Rams, he had 16 receptions for 165 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns. For his game against the Rams, he won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 15 against the Chargers, he had 12 receptions for 144 receiving yards in the 38–15 victory. He passed Largent for second place in the 16th game of the season. Rice was selected to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams. With a 13–3 record and making the postseason, the 49ers won against the Bears in the Divisional Round. In the NFC Championship, they faced the Cowboys for the third straight year. After two previous defeats, the 49ers were victorious against the Cowboys 38–28. Rice was a vital component in their 49–26 victory over the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX, combined with a six-touchdown performance by Young, Rice caught ten passes after catching six in the 49ers last two postseason games, coupled with 149 yards and three touchdowns, despite playing with a separated shoulder for much of the game. In three Super Bowl appearances at this point in his career, Rice caught 28 receptions for 512 yards and seven touchdowns, with all three statistics career Super Bowl records.

==== Final 49ers&#x27; seasons (1995–2000) ====
During the 1995 season, Rice had a record-setting campaign. After an 87-yard, one-touchdown day to start the season against the New Orleans Saints, Rice had 11 receptions for 167 yards and two touchdowns in a 41–10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. Following a two-touchdown game against the New England Patriots in Week 3, Rice had 11 receptions for 181 yards in a 27–24 loss to the Detroit Lions. In Rice&#x27;s next three games, he scored a receiving touchdown in each. On October 29, with an eight reception, 108-yard performance in Week 9, he surpassed James Lofton as the all-time leader in receiving yards against the Saints, with 14,040. Against the Cowboys, he had five receptions for 161 yards and a touchdown in a Week 11 victory. In Week 12, against the Miami Dolphins, he had eight receptions for 149 yards and two touchdowns in the 44–20 victory. Rice had one of the best statistical games in his career against the Vikings, catching 14 passes for a career-high 289 yards (at the time the fifth-most ever in a game), and three touchdowns. Rice won NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Vikings. Vikings head coach Dennis Green said of Rice: &quot;We did take the 49ers out of their running game, but Jerry was the one ingredient we had a hard time stopping&quot;, &quot;In fact, we had a hard time slowing him down&quot;. In the final game of the regular season against the Atlanta Falcons, he surpassed Art Monk as the all-time leader in receptions, with 942; his performance included 12 receptions for 153 yards, a 41-yard touchdown-throw, and a fumble recovery for a touchdown; his yards total was enough to break the record for most receiving yards in a season, with 1,848 yards, coupled with 122 receptions and 15 touchdowns. He was selected to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro teams. His single-season receiving yards record was not broken until Calvin Johnson broke it in 2012. With an 11–5 record and making the postseason, the 49ers lost in the Divisional Round to the Green Bay Packers, in which Rice had 11 receptions for 117 yards.

During the offseason of 1996, Rice and Jackie were expecting their third child, and on May 16, 1996, Jada Rice was born. Minutes after the birth, however, Jackie suffered complications and nearly died from blood loss. She made a recovery after many surgeries. This caused Rice to miss almost all of June mini-camp and one week of training camp; he was supported by his teammates and coaches along the way. Even through these troubles, he was available for the start of the regular season. In Week 4, against the Carolina Panthers, he had ten receptions for 127 receiving yards. In Week 7, he had his only game of the season with multiple receiving touchdowns with two against the Green Bay Packers. He had ten receptions for 129 yard and a touchdown in a Week 15 loss to the Carolina Panthers. Overall, he recorded 108 receptions (leading the NFL) for 1,254 yards and eight touchdowns. Rice was selected to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro. With a 12–4 record and making the postseason, San Francisco won in the Wild Card Round against the Philadelphia Eagles 14–0 with Rice scoring a touchdown, but lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round, as the 49ers were unable to gain any ground with their offense, with only 196 yards of total offense. Through 1994 and 1996, Rice racked up 342 catches for 4,601 yards and 36 touchdowns.

Before the 1997 season, Rice signed a seven-year, $32 million contract. During the 49ers&#x27; opening game of the season, Rice tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee on a reverse. Warren Sapp of the Buccaneers grabbed Rice by the face mask and wrenched him to the ground, drawing a 15-yard personal foul. The injury broke Rice&#x27;s streak of 189 consecutive games played; throughout high school, college, and the NFL he had never missed a game excluding three strike games. Wanting to make it back in time for the retirement of Montana&#x27;s jersey number, he made his return 14 weeks later on December 15, much earlier than doctors wanted him to. He scored a touchdown, but he cracked his left patella as he came down with the catch. He missed the Pro Bowl team for the first time in 11 years due to the injury. San Francisco still made the postseason with a 13–3 record, beating the Minnesota Vikings in the Divisional Round 38–22, but lost for the third straight time against the Green Bay Packers 23–10 in the NFC Championship.

Rice made a full recovery, coming back in time for the 1998 regular season opener. In Week 4, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 162 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 31–20 victory. In Week 11, in another game against the Falcons, he had ten receptions for 169 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown. Overall, he recorded 82 catches for 1,157 yards and nine touchdowns, becoming the oldest receiver ever to record a 1,000-yard season, at age 36, and returned to the Pro Bowl team. San Francisco made the postseason with a 12–4 record. They faced the Packers once again the Wild Card Round. Although Rice only had one catch for six yards in the game, the 49ers defeated the Packers 30–27. San Francisco was defeated in the Divisional Round by the Atlanta Falcons 18–20. Rice had a receiving touchdown in the loss.

In Week 13 of the 1999 season, Rice had nine receptions for 157 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the 44–30 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. In the 49ers&#x27; regular season finale against the Atlanta Falcons, he had six receptions for 143 yards in the 34–29 defeat. Rice finished the 1999 season with 67 receptions for 830 yards and five touchdowns. The season was the first that Rice failed to reach 1,000 yards receiving while playing in all 16 games. San Francisco struggled as a whole, going 4–12 and missing the postseason, losing 11 out of their last 12 games after Young had concussion troubles, leading him to retire after the season.

In the 2000 season, his final season in San Francisco, he again missed 1,000 receiving yards, with 75 receptions for 805 yards and seven touchdowns. The 2000 season marked Rice&#x27;s first without having a game where he recorded at least 100 receiving yards. In his final home game against the Bears, he had seven receptions for 76 yards in the 17–0 victory. It was the same game in which Terrell Owens set the single-game record for receptions, with 20. That angered Rice as he wanted it to be a special day for him, not for Owens, and many of Owens&#x27; receptions were intentionally called in order for him to break the record. San Francisco again struggled going 6–10 and missing the postseason.

=== Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, and later career (2001–2005) ===

==== Oakland Raiders ====
With the emergence of Terrell Owens in San Francisco and because of their desire to rebuild the team and clear salary, Rice was released by the 49ers in June 2001 and signed with the Oakland Raiders for a four-year, $7.8 million contract. He joined a Raiders team coming off a loss in the playoffs to form one of the oldest receiver duos with Tim Brown (age 35). During the season, he had an eight reception, 131-yard performance with three touchdowns against the Chargers, and a nine reception, 108-yard performance against the Broncos. Rice caught 83 passes for 1,139 yards and nine touchdowns for the year. Oakland finished the season with a 10–6 record and made the postseason. The Raiders played the New York Jets in the Wild Card Round, winning 38–24, with Rice having nine receptions for 183 yards and a touchdown. In the Divisional Round, the Raiders faced Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. In what was later called the &quot;Tuck Rule Game&quot;, the Raiders lost in overtime 16–13, after officials reviewed an apparent Brady fumble, overturning the call on the field to be an incomplete pass, allowing the Patriots to kick the game-tying field goal, all in a severe snowstorm.

In 2002, Rice caught 92 passes for 1,211 yards and seven touchdowns, while being named to his 13th Pro Bowl team, and to the Second-team All-Pro team. Rice&#x27;s teammate, Raiders starting quarterback Rich Gannon, was named the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player for the 2002 season. Against the Tennessee Titans, where Rice had seven receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, he surpassed Walter Payton as the all-time leader in scrimmage yards, with 21,281 scrimmage yards. He scored his 200th career touchdown against the Broncos. Oakland finished the season with an 11–5 record and made the postseason. They won in the Divisional Round against the Jets, 30–10. Rice had a receiving touchdown in the win. The team won in the AFC Championship against the Tennessee Titans, 41–24, making it to the Super Bowl. There, against the Buccaneers, coached by former Raiders head coach Jon Gruden, they were defeated 21–48, with Gannon throwing five interceptions, including three for touchdowns, and Rice having five receptions for 77 yards and a touchdown. Up to this point, Rice had been undefeated in the Super Bowl, having already won three with San Francisco. The fact that he lost a Super Bowl overwhelmed him to the point that he cried in his hotel room after the game.

In Week 4 of the 2003 season, Rice had seven receptions for 126 receiving yards in the 34–31 victory of the San Diego Chargers. In Week 16, against the Green Bay Packers, he had ten receptions for 159 receiving yards in the 41–7 loss. Overall, in the 2003 season, Rice caught 63 passes for 869 yards; he didn&#x27;t score a touchdown until the 12th game of the season, scoring only two through the whole year. Oakland as a team regressed from their 11–5 record in 2002 to a 4–12 record in 2003, leading to the firing of head coach Bill Callahan. That led Rice to be frustrated about his role with the team.

By the time the 2004 season was starting, Rice struggled, and by the fourth game of the season, Rice had five receptions for only 64 yards. Because of that, he asked Raiders owner Al Davis to trade him.

==== Seattle Seahawks ====
Rice was traded to the Seattle Seahawks six games into the 2004 season in exchange for a seventh round pick and reunited with Seattle head coach Mike Holmgren, who had previously worked with Rice as San Francisco&#x27;s offensive coordinator. After speaking with Largent, Rice was permitted to wear Largent&#x27;s retired jersey No. 80. In a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Dallas Cowboys, Rice set the career record for combined net yards by catching a 27-yard touchdown pass from Matt Hasselbeck, his 35th career record. He finished that game eight receptions for 145 yards and a touchdown. In total Rice had 25 receptions for 362 receiving yards and three touchdowns with the Seahawks, having 30 receptions for 429 yards and three touchdowns in total for the season. At age 41, he managed to play 17 games in a 16-game season, as he was traded before Oakland&#x27;s bye week and after Seattle&#x27;s, and never missed a game, so he played six games for the Raiders and 11 for the Seahawks. Rice played his last non-preseason professional game for Seattle, a Wild Card Round loss to the St. Louis Rams in which he did not catch a pass.

===Denver Broncos===
After the 2004 season, Rice signed a one-year contract worth $790,000 in total salary with the Denver Broncos which was his lowest contract offer in his 20 years in the league. Rice never played for the Broncos, therefore he was only allowed his guaranteed money for a grand total of $25,000.

==== Retirement ====
Just before the 2005 season, on September 5, 2005, Rice announced his retirement after 20 seasons. In August 2006, the 49ers announced that Rice would sign a contract with them, allowing him to retire as a member of the team where his NFL career began. On August 24, he officially retired as a 49er, signing a one-day contract for $1,985,806.49. The number represented the year Rice was drafted (1985), his No. 80, the year he retired (2006), and the 49ers (49). The figure was ceremonial, and Rice received no money. A halftime ceremony honored him during the 49ers&#x27; match-up with the Seattle Seahawks on November 19, 2006.

== Legacy ==
Rice holds numerous NFL receiving records. His 197 career touchdown receptions are 41 scores more than the second place of 156 touchdown receptions by Randy Moss; his 208 total touchdowns (197 receiving, ten rushing, and one fumble recovery) are 33 scores ahead of Emmitt Smith&#x27;s second-place total of 175. His 22,895 career receiving yards are 5,403 yards ahead of the second-place Larry Fitzgerald. His 1,256 career points scored make him the highest-scoring non-kicker in NFL history. Many of these records are considered by sports analysts to be unbreakable. During a career spanning two decades, Rice averaged 75.6 receiving yards per game. He received MVP votes in six out of his 20 seasons, finishing as the runner-up twice in 1987 and 1995. He won two NFL Offensive Player of The Year Awards, and a Bert Bell Award in 1987.

Rice is remembered as one of the best clutch players in football history, often making game-winning catches throughout his career. Rice also was noted as an effective blocking receiver. Rice&#x27;s &quot;famous&quot; catching ability, sometimes attributed to him having to catch bricks when working with his father during his childhood, led him to 1,549 career receptions, 117 ahead of the second-place Fitzgerald.

Despite being keen about his public image early in his career, Rice is remembered for his work ethic and dedication. He still cared extensively about his physical appearance, often tailoring his uniform and jersey, and combed his hair before putting on his helmet; his philosophy was: &quot;If you look good, feel good, you&#x27;ll play good&quot;, as described by Shawn Rogers, one of his friends. In his 20 NFL seasons, Rice missed only 17 regular season games, 14 of them in the 1997 season and the other three in the strike-shortened season of 1987; his 303 games are the most ever by an NFL wide receiver by a wide margin. In addition to staying on the field, his work ethic showed in his dedication to conditioning and running precise routes, with coach Dennis Green calling him &quot;the best route runner I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. One of the best-known examples of his dedication and ethic was &quot;The Hill,&quot; a steep hill in Edgewood County Park &amp; Natural Preserve which is long. Rice sprinted across the hill every day during the offseason to improve his abilities.

In 1999, Rice was ranked No. 2 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, behind only Jim Brown, and was 35 places ahead of the next-highest-ranked player then active, Deion Sanders. In 2000, Rice won the ESPY Award for Pro Football Player of the Decade for the 1990s. On November 4, 2010, he was ranked No. 1 on &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;. In 2011, The Sports Network awarded the inaugural Jerry Rice Award, to be given each year to the most outstanding freshman Football Championship Subdivision (formerly I-AA) player. The inaugural winner was Towson running back Terrance West.

In January 2015, Rice talked about putting Stickum, a substance which makes the ball easier to catch and hold on to, on his gloves during his career saying, &quot;I know this might be a little illegal, guys, but you put a little spray, a little Stickum on them, to make sure that texture is a little sticky.&quot; Stickum and similar adhesives were banned in the NFL in 1981, four years before Rice joined the league; he said that &quot;all players&quot; who played in his era used the substance. The claims were rebutted by Pro Football Hall of Fame members Cris Carter and Michael Irvin. Rice retracted his claim shortly thereafter and said that he &quot;never used Stickum.&quot;

Rice was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2010 in his first year of eligibility. He was inducted in Canton, Ohio, on August 7, 2010, alongside Emmitt Smith, Floyd Little, Russ Grimm, Rickey Jackson, Dick LeBeau, and John Randle. On September 20, 2010, during halftime of a game against the Saints, the 49ers retired Rice&#x27;s No. 80 jersey. He was officially named to both the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team and the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. During his career, he was included in the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team and the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team.

== Personal life ==
Rice married Jacqueline Bernice Mitchell on September 8, 1987. Jacqueline Rice filed for divorce in June 2007, which became final in late December 2009. They have three children, Jaqui Bonet (born 1987), Jerry Rice Jr. (born 1991), and Jada Symone (born 1996). Jerry Jr., who attended high school at Menlo School in Atherton, California, graduated in 2009. He was a walk-on at UCLA and redshirted his first season. After three seasons and limited playing time, Jerry Jr. graduated from UCLA and transferred to UNLV, and was eligible to play immediately. He played wide receiver for the Rebels and participated in a 49ers local pro day before the 2014 NFL draft, but was not drafted. Jerry Rice has another son, Brenden Rice, who played football for the University of Colorado for two years. On January 1, 2022, it was announced that Brenden was transferring to the University of Southern California. As of October 21, 2019, Rice is married to Latisha Pelayo whom he had dated since 2008.

Rice is a Christian. He said he grew up as a Christian and still has the same faith from his youth.

=== After football ===

During the 2005–2006 broadcasting season, Rice competed in the reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He paired with dancer Anna Trebunskaya, and they reached the final two before losing to singer Drew Lachey and his partner Cheryl Burke. In 2009, Rice portrayed Hal Gore in the film &quot;Without a Paddle: Nature&#x27;s Calling&quot;. In the same year, he guest-starred as himself in the episode &quot;Lyin&#x27; King&quot; on the sitcom &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;. Rice has co-authored two books about his life: &quot;Rice&quot; (with Michael Silver, published 1996, ) and &quot;Go Long: My Journey Beyond the Game and the Fame&quot; (with Brian Curtis, published 2007, ). In 2019, he co-authored a book &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The NFL at 100&quot; (with Randy O. Williams, ), celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Football League. Rice and his dog, Nitus, were featured in &quot;Jerry Rice &amp; Nitus&#x27; Dog Football&quot;, a video game for the Wii that was released on August 16, 2011. Rice served as an alumni captain for &quot;Team Rice&quot; during the 2014 and 2016 Pro Bowls. In 2022, Rice partnered with the American Red Cross to raise awareness about blood donations.

Rice has played golf for over 20 years and woke up early to play golf during his football career. He competed in the Fresh Express Classic at TPC Stonebrae on the Nationwide Tour on April 15–16, 2010, receiving a sponsor&#x27;s exemption to play in the tournament. Rice missed the cut and finished one shot ahead of last place, 17-over and 151st among the 152 players who completed two rounds. He was a team captain on The Big Break Puerto Rico, where his team won.

After Colin Kaepernick announced that he would be kneeling during the national anthem during games, Rice criticized his actions and said on Twitter, &quot;All lives matter. So much going on in this world today. Can we all just get along! Colin, I respect your stance but don&#x27;t disrespect the Flag&quot;. He backtracked a bit later that month after being criticized by other players and the public.

<doc id="402609" wikidata="Q307587" url="?curid=402609" title="Abdullah bin Saud Al Saud">
<text>Abdullah bin Saud Al Saud (; died May 1819) was the last ruler of the First Saudi State, from 1814 to 1818, and was executed in Constantinople under the Ottoman Empire. Although the Ottomans maintained several garrisons in the Nejd thereafter, they were unable to prevent the rise of the Emirate of Nejd, also known as the Second Saudi State, led by Turki bin Abdullah.

==Early life==
Abdullah was the eldest son of Saud bin Abdulaziz, who declared him as the heir apparent in 1805. Abdullah&#x27;s first military command was in 1811. In his second command he fought against the Egyptians in 1812, and was unable to prevent them from ultimately recapturing Hejaz. Following his failure, Saud bin Abdulaziz took back the command, which delayed the capture of the region.

==Reign==
Abdullah succeeded his father, Saud, in May 1814. At the beginning of his reign, Abdullah faced intra-family challenges from his uncle Abdullah bin Muhammad, but managed to settle these problems. 

His father had initiated a war with the Ottoman Empire with the capture of Hejaz, which were regained by the Ottomans in 1813. Because of his father&#x27;s conquest, Abdullah immediately had to face an invasion of his domains by an Ottoman-Egyptian army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali Pasha. The Ottoman forces began their campaign by quickly recapturing Mecca and Medina. Heavily outnumbered and under-equipped, the forces of Diriyah Emirate were defeated in 1815 and retreated to their stronghold of Najd. Following the battle, Muhammad Ali sent a letter to Abdullah requesting his submission and, in May 1815, an agreement was made which terminated Abdullah&#x27;s claims over two Islamic holy cities, Mecca and Medina, and recognised the supremacy of the Ottoman sultan. Between 1814 and 1816 Abdullah had to deal with the concerns of the British regarding piracy coming from the Qasimi region. Abdullah sent several letters to William Bruce who was the British resident in Bushehr to inform him that the Emirate did not involve in any such event.

Rather than engage the Ottomans in open battle, Abdullah decided to attempt to weather the invasion by fortifying his forces in the Najd towns in 1816. As a result, Ibrahim took the villages of Najd one by one, sacking any town that resisted. Ibrahim finally reached the Saudi capital at Diriyah. After a siege lasting several months, Abdullah finally surrendered on 9 September 1818, marking the end of the Saudi state.

==Fall of the Emirate and execution of Abdullah bin Saud==
Ibrahim systematically razed Diriyah to the ground and sent many members of the Al Saud clan into captivity in Egypt and Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire. Three brothers of Abdullah and eighteen Al Saud members were killed. Abdullah, his three sons and two of his supporters were brought to Cairo in November 1818. 

After a six-month stay in Cairo, Abdullah was transferred to Constantinople by Muhammad Ali Pasha, with a recommendation for a pardon. This was refused and, in May 1819, he and his two supporters were publicly beheaded in the square before Hagia Sophia for their crimes against Islamic holy cities and mosques. Hakan Özoğlu and Altan Tan argue that Abdullah&#x27;s four sons were also beheaded with him. Prior to his execution, Abdullah, who had forbidden listening to music, was forced to listen to the lute.

===Reasons for his execution===
In 1802, during the Wahhabi sack of Karbala, the mausoleum of Husayn ibn Ali was desecrated by the army of Abdullah bin Saud, causing anger and shock in the Muslim world. As a result, the Ottoman authorities found themselves in a situation that they had to punish the Saudis for their crimes. The guardian of Islam&#x27;s religious places was the Turkish-Ottoman Caliph in Constantinople, Mahmud II, who ordered that an Egyptian force be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to defeat Abdullah bin Saud and his allies. In 1818, an Egyptian army led by Ibrahim Pasha led a siege on their capital, Diriyah, in Najd. Abdullah eventually surrendered. Abdullah bin Saud was taken along with two of his supporters who were then sent to Cairo and then to Constantinople.

<text>Casimir-Pierre Périer (11 October 1777 16 May 1832) was a French banker, mine owner, political leader and statesman. In business, through his bank in Paris and ownership of the Anzin Coal Co. in the Department of Nord, he contributed significantly to the economic development of France in the early stages of industrialization. In politics, he was a leading liberal member of the Chamber of Deputies throughout the Bourbon Restoration and president of the chamber at the outset of the July Revolution of 1830. He led the liberal-conservative Resistance Party in support of the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe I. He became president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Interior in the spring of 1831 (13 March 1831 – 16 May 1832). Although his ministry was brief, his strong government succeeded in restoring order at home and keeping peace abroad. He fell victim to the cholera epidemic in France in 1832.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Grenoble, Casimir Perier was the fourth of the eight sons of &quot;Milord&quot; Claude-Nicolas Perier (1742–1801), the rich merchant-manufacturer and banker who opened his Château de Vizille to the famous meeting of the Estates of Dauphiné (21 July 1788) foreshadowing the French Revolution. His mother was the former Marie-Charlotte Pascal (1749–1821), the daughter of a prominent linens manufacturer at nearby Voiron. Both his father and grandfather (Jacques Perier, 1702–82) made their fortunes in the commerce of canvas and linen cloths. Claude added the manufacture of printed cotton cloths (&quot;Indiennes&quot;) at the Château de Vizille, which he purchased in 1780 from Gabriel Louis de Neufville, duc de Villeroy. The Revolution and Napoleon opened up new opportunities for families of the wealthy &quot;bourgeoisie grenobloise&quot; such as the Periers. Claude Perier shifted the center of his business affairs to Paris, where he took up residence beginning in 1794 (rue Saint-Honoré) and mingled with leading French financiers. In 1795 he invested in and became a director of the largest coal mining company in northern France, the Anzin Company; in 1796 he helped to found a major investment bank in Paris, the Caisse des Comtes Courants; and in 1799, shortly after Napoleon&#x27;s coup d’état of Brumaire, he became one of the founders and first directors of the famous Bank of France.

Claude Perier died on 6 February 1801, leaving his remarkably large family of ten children to share his enormous estate valued at 5,800,000 francs. Casimir, who was twenty-four years old at the time, inherited shares in the Anzin Company, land at Grenoble (Department of Isère) and in common with his brother Scipion, the property in Paris on the rue Saint-Honoré. He&#x27;d had little experience in business or banking. His father had anticipated that the three eldest brothers, Augustin, Alexandre and Scipion, would carry on the family businesses at Grenoble/Vizille. Casimir himself gave no clear indication of a specific career choice. He was intelligent, energetic, handsome and eager to succeed, but he had spent his life mostly as a student and received a church-school and Jesuit-tutor classical education. During service with the army in Italy from 1799 to 1800, he began to consider a military career, but his father&#x27;s death and legacy, the lure of Paris, and his close friendship with his older brother Scipion took him in a much different direction.

===Business career===

The two brothers, Casimir and Scipion, founded a bank in Paris (8 June 1801), located at No. 8, Place Vendôme until 1809, and after that year at No. 27, rue Neuve du Luxembourg (now the rue Cambon). Henry Flory and William Sabatier, who were former associates with their father at the Bank of France and the Anzin Company, respectively, helped to get the bank started. The youngest Perier brother, Joseph, joined the bank in 1822, approximately one year after the death of Scipion. The affairs of the older Perier bank at Grenoble were by then administered mainly by another younger brother, Alphonse. The bank of &quot;Perier Frères&quot; in Paris, which played a significant and leading role in the early stages of the industrial revolution in France, would be near the peak of its success in the 1820s, numbering importantly by then among a small and select group of private banking houses known collectively as &quot;&quot;la haute banque parisienne&quot;.&quot; Scipion became a regent of the Bank of France in 1818, Casimir in 1820. They both became members of the influential Chamber of Commerce of Paris.

The two most important clients of the Perier bank were the Anzin Coal Company (Department of Nord) and the Perier-owned iron foundry and workshops in Paris at Chaillot. The founder-owner of the Chaillot firm, Jacques-Constantin Perier (1742–1818), who was not related to the Paris bankers, was well known for having brought the Watt steam engine to France. Famously, he used a Watt engine at Chaillot to provide Paris with water pumped from the Seine. In 1802 he supplied the Anzin Company with twenty of his engines for winding and drainage at the mines. Casimir and Scipion Perier purchased the Chaillot firm in 1818 and used its workshops to upgrade Anzin with more efficient Cornish high-pressure engines patented in France by Arthur Woolf. Chaillot was an important part of the most notable entrepreneurial achievement of the Periers during the Restoration, namely, the renovation, managerial reorganization and business expansion of Anzin.

The Anzin Coal Company, which was established in 1757 as a closely held, family-owned firm managed by a self-perpetuating board of six directors, fell on hard times during the Revolution until rescued in 1795 by heavy investments from wealthy representatives of &quot;la grande bourgeoisie&quot; . Thus Claude Perier became a director of the company. The firm did reasonably well after 1795, although most of the new outsiders (&quot;les Parisiens&quot;) who joined the founding families looked on Anzin as simply one of many investments. Not so Casimir and Scipion Perier, who determined to become active owner-directors for purposes of renovating and re-energizing the company for increased production and maximization of profits. The Perier bank in Paris became the company bank, regulating Anzin&#x27;s accounts and contracts and supervising its large reserve funds. The brothers gradually took over making company policies. They were a good team. Scipion had the broad knowledge of the science and technology of the times (he was a long-standing member of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry, est. 1801); Casimir acted as the determined, driving force for innovation and risk-taking as opposed to the &#x27;old ways&#x27; and too cautious decision-making. He was Anzin&#x27;s ‘ &quot;homme fort&quot;’ during the rejuvenation of the company in the 1820s. His much-quoted 1826 general report on Anzin company affairs illustrated the thoroughness of his knowledge of his firm&#x27;s needs and potential. One measure of success during the Restoration was that output of coal at the mines increased from 250,000 metric tons in 1816 to 509,000 tons in 1830.

In association with other prominent bankers and business leaders, the Periers also engaged in the establishment of new financial institutions of the Restoration. Thus in 1818 Casimir and Scipion were among the founder-directors of the first French savings bank, the Caisse d’Épargne et de Prévoyance de Paris (No. 104, rue Richlieu). Besides the Perier bank, other investors included Jacques Laffitte (governor of the Bank of France, 1814–19) and the banks of Lefebvre, Pillet Will, and Cottier. The same five banking houses helped back the organization during 1816-20 of an important early insurance company, the Compagnie Royale d’Assurances, and in 1823 they would take part in the Compagnie des Quatre Canaux, a joint-stock company for loans to the government to improve the canal system in northern France. Perhaps a best example of the Perier bank&#x27;s involvement in innovative financial ventures during the Restoration was the case of the ill-starred Société Commanditaire de l’Industrie. Conceived in 1825 mainly by Jacques Laffitte, its prospective president, this joint-stock company capitalized at 100 million francs was intended to help remedy the growing need in France for increased investment capital for large-scale projects in areas such as mining, metallurgy, canal construction and land development. It had the support of the &quot;haute banque&quot; and foreign banking houses. Casimir Perier and William Ternaux, France&#x27;s leading woolens manufacturer, were its prospective vice-presidents. But in the end, unfortunately, the conservative Villèle ministry under Charles X refused to authorize the establishment of the Commanditaire.

Casimir Perier&#x27;s policy as a banker was to spread his capital investment over a wide range of characteristic early nineteenth century business enterprise. He engaged as well in almost continuous investment in land and real estate, calculated most recently at about 15% of his total investments during 1815-30. Most notable were his purchases of highly valued properties on the rue Neuve du Luxembourg, the rue Sainte-Honoré and the Champs-Elysées; a summer residence in the Bois de Boulogne; the Château Saint-Pierre (&#x27;le Taillis&#x27;) in Normandy, near Rouen; and the parkland and ruins of the Château Pont-sur-Seine (Department of Aube), a property owned previously by Napoleon that was destroyed by invading armies in 1814. Casimir&#x27;s largest investment in Paris real estate during the Restoration was made in 1829-30 when he agreed to pay 744,600 francs for properties on the rue Saint-Honoré owned by Francis Egerton, Duke of Bridgewater. By the time of the Revolution of 1830, Casimir Perier was one of the richest men in Paris. At the age of 55 in 1832, when he died of cholera, his estate was estimated at close to 14 million francs.

Both Casimir and Scipion Perier valued education and believed strongly in the advancement of science and technology. They supported Joseph Degérando&#x27;s Société pour l’Amélioration de l’Enseignement Élémentaire (est. 1815) and they arranged at Anzin for night-school instruction for workers using courses designed by Charles Dupin. In Paris, they supported the practical education programs provided by the École Spéciale de Commerce, founded in 1816, and the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures established in 1828. After Casimir was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1817, he would vote to protect the budgets of the Conservatory of Arts and Sciences and trade schools in the departments.

===Political career===

Casimir Perier&#x27;s wide-ranging business interests and investments help to explain his opposition in the Chamber of Deputies to financial policies of Restoration ministries. In 1817, he opposed the policy of the Richelieu ministry for raising loans to pay the war indemnity demanded by the allied coalition after Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat. In the 1820s, he was a leader in debates (1821–1822) against the policies of the Villèle ministry for financing canal construction and (1824–1825) for indemnifying the nobility for lands confiscated during the Revolution.

Perier entered the Chamber of Deputies for Paris in 1817, taking his seat in the Left Centre with the moderate opposition, and making his first speech in defense of the freedom of the press. Re-elected for Paris in 1822 and 1824, and in 1827 for Paris and for Troyes, he elected to represent Troyes (Department of Aube), and sat for that constituency until his death. Perier&#x27;s violence in debate was not associated with any disloyalty to the Bourbon Restoration, and he held resolutely aloof from the Republican conspiracies and intrigues which prepared the way for the revolution of 1830. Under the Martignac ministry, there was some prospect of a reconciliation with the court, and, in January 1829, he was nominated a candidate for the presidency of the chamber; but in August with the elevation to power of Jules, Prince de Polignac, the truce ceased, and on 15 March 1830, Perier was one of the 221 deputies who repudiated the Ordinances put forward by Charles X.

Averse by instinct and by interest to popular revolution, Perier nevertheless sat on the provisory commission of five at the Hôtel de Ville during the Three Glorious Days of July 1830, but he refused to sign the declaration of Charles X&#x27;s dethronement. Perier reluctantly recognized in the government of Louis Philippe&#x27;s constitutional monarchy the only alternative to the continuance of the Revolution, but he was no favorite with the new king, whom he scorned for his trucking with the Paris &#x27;mob&#x27;. He became President of the Chamber of Deputies, and sat for a few months in the cabinet, though without a portfolio.

===President of the Council===
During the first years of the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, following the fall of the weak and discredited ministry of Jacques Laffitte, Perier, who had drifted more and more to the Right, was summoned to power (13 March 1831), and, in the short space of a year, he more or less restored civic order in France and re-established her credit in Europe. Paris was in a constant state of disturbance from March to September, and was only held in check by the premier&#x27;s determination. The Canut Revolt at Lyon was suppressed after hard fighting; and at Grenoble, in face of the quarrels between the military and the inhabitants, Perier declined to make any concession to the townsfolk. For Perier, the Revolution of 1830 was not the beginning of greater things to come, it was the end of the Revolution of 1789. As he said to Odilon Barrot of Laffitte&#x27;s &quot;Party of Movement&quot;: &quot;No, Monsieur, there has not been a revolution, only a change in the head of state.&quot;

As a minister, Perier refused to be dragged into armed intervention in favor of the revolutionary government of Warsaw, but his policy of peace did not exclude energetic demonstrations in support of French interests. He constituted France the protector of Belgium by the prompt expedition of the army of the north against the Dutch in August 1831. French influence in Italy was asserted by the audacious occupation of Ancona (23 February 1832); and the refusal of compensation for injuries to French residents by the Portuguese government was followed by a naval demonstration at Lisbon.

Perier had undertaken the premiership with many forebodings, and overwork and anxiety prepared the way for disease. In the spring of 1832, during the cholera outbreak in Paris, he visited the hospitals in company with Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans. He fell ill the next day of a violent fever, and died six weeks later.

==Private life==
Casimir Perier married (13 October 1805) Marie Cécile Laurence Loyer, nicknamed &quot;Pauline&quot;, the daughter of Laurent-Pouthus Loyer, an old regime magistrate of Lyon who was a victim of the Terror during the Revolution. There were two sons: Auguste Casimir-Perier (1811–1876), deputy for Seine and Aube, and Charles-Paul Perier (1812–1897), deputy and senator for Seine-Inférieur. Auguste-Casimir&#x27;s son, Jean Casimir-Perier (1847–1907), was elected President of the Third Republic in 1894.

<text>Ernő Goldfinger (11 September 1902 – 15 November 1987) was a Hungarian-born British architect and designer of furniture. He moved to the United Kingdom in the 1930s, and became a key member of the Modernist architectural movement. He is most prominently remembered for designing residential tower blocks, some of which are now listed buildings.

==Biography==

Goldfinger was born in Budapest to a Jewish family. The family business was forestry and saw-mills, which led Goldfinger to consider a career in engineering until he became interested in architecture after reading Hermann Muthesius&#x27;s &quot;Das englische Haus&quot;, a description of English domestic architecture around the turn of the twentieth century. 

Goldfinger moved to Paris in 1921, after the defeat and collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1923, he went to study at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in the atelier of Léon Jaussely, and in the following years got to know many other Paris-based architects, including Auguste Perret, Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. In 1929, before finishing his studies, Goldfinger established a partnership and worked on a number of interior designs and an extension to a holiday home at Le Touquet.

He was strongly influenced by the publication of Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Vers une architecture&quot;, and became a fervent admirer of Le Corbusier&#x27;s former mentor, Auguste Perret, an expert in designing reinforced concrete structures and an inspiration for Goldfinger when designing his own home. In the early 1930s, Goldfinger met and married Ursula Blackwell, heiress to the Crosse &amp; Blackwell fortune. Goldfinger was based in the UK for the remainder of his career.

===Modernist in London===

In 1934, Ernő and his wife, Ursula, moved to a flat in Highpoint I, London. Before World War II, Goldfinger built three houses (including his own) at 1–3 Willow Road in Hampstead, North London, and another at Broxted, Essex. His own house, 2 Willow Road, is now in the care of the National Trust.

===Post World War II===
After the war, Goldfinger was commissioned to build new offices for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper and the headquarters of the British Communist Party. In the 1950s, he designed two London primary schools from prefabricated pre-cast concrete with brick infill for the London County Council in Putney. A cottage forming part of one of these schools, Brandlehow School, was demolished by a rogue developer who was prosecuted in 2008, and ordered to restore the building to &quot;exactly match&quot; its former appearance.
 On the site of George Coles&#x27;s Trocadero cinema in south-east London, Goldfinger built Alexander Fleming House for the Ministry of Health, and the Odeon Elephant &amp; Castle, which opened in 1966, and has since been demolished.

====Rise of the high rise====
In an attempt to solve the huge shortage of housing in the country following World War II, during which nearly 4 million houses had been destroyed or damaged, the British Government began to see high-rise buildings as a solution. Goldfinger rose to prominence in England as a designer of tower blocks.

Among his most notable buildings of the period were the 27-floor Balfron Tower and the adjacent eleven-storey Carradale House in Poplar, which served as models for the similar 31-floor Trellick Tower in Kensal Town (started 1968, completed 1972). These three buildings are notable examples of Brutalist architecture.

===Personal life===
Goldfinger was known as a humourless man given to notorious rages. He sometimes fired his assistants if they were inappropriately jocular, and once forcibly ejected two prospective clients for imposing restrictions on his design.

A discussion on a golf course about Ernő with Goldfinger&#x27;s cousin prompted Ian Fleming to name the James Bond adversary and villain Auric Goldfinger after Ernő—Fleming had been among the objectors to the pre-war demolition of the cottages in Hampstead that were removed to make way for Goldfinger&#x27;s house at 2 Willow Road. Goldfinger consulted his lawyers when &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was published in 1959, which prompted Fleming to threaten to rename the character &#x27;Goldprick&#x27;, but eventually decided not to sue; Fleming&#x27;s publishers agreed to pay his costs and gave him six free copies of the book.

Goldfinger died on 15 November 1987, at the age of 85. He was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium where his ashes remain.

==Legacy==
Although Goldfinger enjoyed living in his own buildings, they were unpopular among both the public and many post-modernist architects. Towards the end of the 20th century Goldfinger&#x27;s work became more appreciated. Trellick Tower is now a Grade II* listed building and has become something of a design icon, appearing on T-shirts, paintings, and in the lyrics of the song &quot;Best Days&quot; by Blur. The few privately owned flats within fetch high prices at sale. Balfron Tower and Carradale House are also listed Grade II, while an adjacent building by Goldfinger&#x27;s studio, the 14-storey Glenkerry House, is run as a housing co-operative and is regarded as a model for management of buildings of the type.

In 2000, Ernő Goldfinger&#x27;s estate endowed a sum of money to foster links between Hungary and the United Kingdom by sponsoring young Hungarian architectural students to study, travel, or work in the UK. Their intention was to honour his achievements, his commitment to his profession, and his lifelong support for his compatriots. Six RIBA Goldfinger Scholarships were awarded from 2002 to 2011.

<doc id="402633" wikidata="Q5502930" url="?curid=402633" title="Fresh Air">
<text>Fresh Air is an American radio talk show broadcast on National Public Radio stations across the United States since 1985. It is produced by WHYY-FM in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The show&#x27;s hosts are Terry Gross and Tonya Mosley. , the show was syndicated to 624 stations and claimed nearly 5 million listeners. The show is fed live weekdays at 12:00 noon ET. In addition, some stations carry &quot;Fresh Air Weekend&quot;, a re-programming of highlights of the week&#x27;s interviews. In 2016, &quot;Fresh Air&quot; was the most-downloaded podcast on iTunes.

==Overview==
The show began in 1975 at WHYY (then called WUHY), with Judy Blank as host. In September of that year, Terry Gross took over as presenter and producer; nearly 50 years later she remains its chief presenter. In 1985, WHYY launched a weekly half-hour edition of &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, which was distributed nationally by NPR. The show began daily national broadcasts in 1987. The show is composed primarily of interviews with prominent figures in various fields, among them entertainment and the arts, culture, journalism, and global current affairs. This main segment is followed by shorter segments, most often comprising coverage and reviews of events and new releases in various cultural and entertainment spheres. The subjects of these shorter segments include movies, books, stage plays, television programs, as well as recordings of popular music, jazz, and classical music. The program also features commentary and interviews from a range of regular contributors, including Maureen Corrigan, David Bianculli, Dave Davies, Ken Tucker, Kevin Whitehead, John Powers, Lloyd Schwartz, Geoffrey Nunberg, Justin Chang, and Nick Quah. Past contributors include Geoff Nunberg, Milo Miles, and Ed Ward. Tonya Mosley, who co-hosted WBUR&#x27;s &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;, was named co-host of &quot;Fresh Air&quot; in 2023. The show was formerly titled &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot; but is now simply branded &quot;Fresh Air&quot;.

David Edelstein was let go from his position as film critic for the show on November 27, 2018, for comments made in the wake of Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s death.

The executive producer of &quot;Fresh Air&quot; is Danny Miller. The program is produced and edited by Amy Salit, Phyllis Myers, Ann Marie Baldonado, Sam Briger, Lauren Krenzel, Heidi Saman, Therese Madden, Seth Kelley, Thea Chaloner, and Susan Nyakundi. The show is directed by Roberta Shorrock. Audrey Bentham is the engineer. Molly Seavy-Nesper is the producer of Digital Media.

==Background==
The program&#x27;s interviews are pre-recorded and edited, not broadcast live.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT, Kerr, 11/17/2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As with many such radio programs, guests are often not in the studio during recording, and often speak remotely from a local affiliate station, or a home studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT, Burton, 10/25/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When pressing news requires, the show has gone live, such as during the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, and in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing on April 19, 2013.

&quot;Fresh Air&quot; interviews are generally first aired on the Monday through Thursday shows. The Friday shows are rebroadcasts of past interviews.

The show&#x27;s theme song, a jazz piece called &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, was composed for the program by Joel Forrester of The Microscopic Septet.

==Controversial interviews==
In February 2002, when Gross interviewed Gene Simmons of Kiss, Simmons discussed his sexual experimentation with women of all age groups and propositioned Gross in demonstration; according to NPR&#x27;s website, Simmons withheld permission to supply transcripts or audio of the interview on their website.

In July 2010, &quot;Fresh Air&quot; was removed from Mississippi Public Broadcasting radio because of &quot;recurring inappropriate content&quot;, shortly after the broadcast of an interview with comedian Louis C.K. in which he discussed his sex life. By mid-2011, it had returned to the state network&#x27;s evening line-up.

==Awards==
In 1993, NPR, &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, and Gross were presented with the George Foster Peabody Award with praise for her &quot;probing questions, revelatory interviews, and unusual insights&quot;. The show was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2012. The show also won an institutional Peabody in 2022.

In 2004, Gross published a book of her favorite interviews from the show under the title &quot;All I Did Was Ask&quot;.

In 2016, Gross received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama, &quot;For her artful probing of the human experience. Her patient, persistent questioning in thousands of interviews over four decades has pushed public figures to reveal personal motivations behind extraordinary lives—revealing simple truths that affirm our common humanity.&quot;

<doc id="402635" wikidata="Q7978096" url="?curid=402635" title="Weapons of Mass Deception">
<text>Weapons of Mass Deception is pejorative expression used by some people to describe U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction as justification for the war on Iraq.

The variation Weapons of Mass Distraction has also been used by pundits and satirists. This punning alteration accuses the Bush administration of using the war in Iraq to draw the nation&#x27;s attention away from other problems, such as the economic recession of 2002. The meaning was later inverted to describe Bush&#x27;s alleged attempts to divert attention away from the war following a drop in public support for the war.

== Book ==

&quot;Weapons of Mass Deception&quot; was used as the title of a nonfiction book by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber. This book focused specifically on the PR tactics and techniques of the Bush administration after the September 11th terrorist attacks.

* Publisher: Tarcher (July 28, 2003)

== Other media ==
&quot;Weapons of Mass Deception&quot; was also used as the title of a documentary produced by Danny Schechter which originally aired on HBO.

It is also the name of the fourth album by the British band Dissident Prophet.

Also, a popular NPR commentator Connie Rice read her Top Ten Weapons of Mass Distraction on The Tavis Smiley Show, July 14, 2004.

<doc id="402636" wikidata="Q13583449" url="?curid=402636" title="Flight (military unit)">
<text>A flight is a small military unit within the larger structure of an air force, naval air service, or army air corps; and is usually subordinate to a larger squadron. A military aircraft flight is typically composed of four aircraft, though two to six aircraft may also form an aircraft flight; along with their aircrews and ground staff. In some very specific examples, typically involving historic aircraft, a flight may contain as many as twelve aircraft, as is the case with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) of the British Royal Air Force (RAF). In most usages, two or more flights make up a squadron. Foreign languages equivalents include (French), (Spanish), (Portuguese), &quot;lanka&quot; (Ukrainian), (Romanian), (Russian), and (German).

In the case of a non-flying, or &quot;ground flight&quot;, such as Mechanical Transport Flight (MTF), Supply Flight, Accounts Flight, etc; no aircraft, and a roughly equivalent number of support personnel may be utilised.

The term &quot;flight&quot; is also a basic unit for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

== Origins ==
The use of the term &quot;flight&quot; originated in the United Kingdom  to describe a collection of aircraft (typically four in the early days of aviation), and dates back to around 1912. It has been suggested that the term was coined by technical sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which was examining the British air arrangements around the same time.

== Commonwealth flights ==
=== Aircraft flight ===
In the United Kingdom Royal Air Force (RAF), and the other air forces of the British Commonwealth, from where much air force terminology emanated, an aircraft flight, in the first decades of air forces, was commanded by a flight lieutenant (FltLt), a rank equivalent to captain in armies and other air forces, or a naval lieutenant. More recently, however, it has become common for a flight to be led by a squadron leader (SqnLdr); a formal rank distinct from a squadron commander; equivalent to an army major or naval lieutenant commander.

On rare occasions, a flight may further be sub-divided into two sections, each containing two to three aircraft, which share ground staff with the other section, and are usually commanded by a flight lieutenant.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s (RN) Fleet Air Arm (FAA), the Army Air Corps (AAC), and other Commonwealth naval and army aviation arms also have flights. In the Fleet Air Arm, a flight could be as few as a single helicopter operating from a smaller ship.

=== Ground flight ===
A ground flight within an air force is roughly equivalent to a platoon in an army, and may be commanded by a flight lieutenant, flying officer, pilot officer, or warrant officer. These ground flights may carry out operational roles (such as air traffic control, airfield defence, or firefighting), engineering roles (such as aircraft maintenance, ground-based mechanical engineering, or other ground systems maintenance), support roles (including medical, dental, physical training, supply and logistics, training and education, and legal units), or purely administrative roles (such as finance, infrastructure, or human resource management).

A flight is also a basic unit of guided missiles, such as surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).

== American flights ==
The United States Air Force (USAF) has three types of flights: numbered, alphabetic, and aircraft (which may be designated by alpha-numerics or name).

A numbered flight is a unit with a unique base, wing, group, or Numbered Air Force mission; such as training or finance, though not large enough to warrant designation as a squadron. Numbered flights are uncommon, and are usually only found in basic training facilities.

An alphabetic flight is an operational component of a flying or ground squadron, not an independent unit; alphabetic flights within a squadron normally have identical or similar functions, and are normally designated A, B, C, and so, on within the squadron. Flights in the USAF are generally authorised to have between 20 and 100 personnel, and are normally commanded by a company-grade officer (lieutenant or captain), and/or a flight chief, usually a senior non-commissioned officer with the rank of master sergeant or senior master sergeant.

In USAF flying squadrons, the term flight also designates a tactical sub-unit of a squadron consisting of two or three elements (designated &quot;sections&quot; in U.S. Army and U.S. Naval Aviation), with each element consisting of two or three aircraft. The flight operates under the command of a designated flight leader. In U.S. Army Aviation, the equivalent organisational level of a flight is called a &quot;platoon&quot;, while in U.S. Naval Aviation the flight is known as a &quot;division&quot;.

In Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile units of the U.S. Air Force, a flight is composed of ten unstaffed launch facilities, remotely controlled by a staffed launch control center, containing two personnel. Five of these flights make up one missile squadron. The Air Force has a total of 45 ICBM missile flights.

Under U.S. military and FAA common usage, for air traffic control and separation purposes, a &quot;flight&quot; of aircraft is simply two or more aircraft intentionally operating in close proximity to each other (typically in formation) under a designated &quot;flight leader&quot;, without regard to military organisational hierarchy.

== French flights ==
An (literal translations: &quot;squad&quot; or &quot;small squadron&quot;) is the label given to flights in the air forces and navies of some French-speaking countries. While the term is frequently translated into English as &quot;squadron&quot;, an was originally a smaller unit (whereas the French , also translated as &quot;squadron&quot;, in the context of aviation is a much larger unit, comparable in status to a naval squadron).

The first air were formed in France before World War I, in 1912. They were initially a loosely defined group of aircraft capable of similar tasks, in most cases not more than six aeroplanes in each. During the war, the became the basic independent unit of aviation within the French armed forces. An was a homogeneous unit, armed with a single type of aeroplane, with permanent flying and ground personnel attached, motorised transport and tent hangars. By mid-1915, the had grown to 119 of 10 aircraft each: 14 of fighters, 50 of bombers and the rest reconnaissance, spotter and communications units. While initially operated independently, during the Battle of Verdun (1916), (fighter) were formed into larger formations, for easier coordination.

During World War II, French usually fielded between 10 and 12 aircraft. Hence they were roughly equivalent to a German , Italian or Polish (10 aircraft in 1939). This was in contrast to air squadrons of the British Commonwealth or United States, which usually had 12–18 aircraft, divided into two to four flights.

Until 1949, between one and four French formed a . Since then, however, have been subordinate to . As such, and are the equivalent of the German language terms and ; and the English language terms &quot;wing&quot; and &quot;group&quot; (the definitions of which also vary from one nation to another).

== German flights ==
A (meaning swarm) as part of a (squadron) comprises four aircraft and can be further subdivided into twoships called (meaning rout, two aircraft). The tactical formation, however, is the &quot;twoship with hot spare&quot; (the English term is used), the third aircraft being released before reaching the target if none of the others had to be sent back earlier. The (meaning chain) of three aircraft is a historic term. These terms refer to groups of aircraft only and are not used for ground units.

<doc id="402638" wikidata="Q3492117" url="?curid=402638" title="Terry Gross">
<text>Terry Gross (born February 14, 1951) is an American journalist who is the host and co-executive producer of &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, an interview-based radio show produced by WHYY-FM in Philadelphia and distributed nationally by NPR. Since joining NPR in 1975, Gross has interviewed thousands of guests.

Gross has won praise over the years for her low-key and friendly yet often probing interview style and for the diversity of her guests. She has a reputation for researching her guests&#x27; work the night before an interview, often asking them unexpected questions about their early careers.

== Early life ==
Terry Gross was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and grew up in its Sheepshead Bay neighborhood, the second child of Anne (Abrams), a stenographer, and Irving Gross, who worked in a family millinery business, where he sold fabric to milliners. She grew up in a Jewish family, and all her grandparents were immigrants, her father&#x27;s parents from Tarnów, Poland, and her mother&#x27;s from the Russian Empire. She said that her family lived in an apartment near Senior&#x27;s Restaurant, a local landmark. When she was young, people would often ask where Gross came from, assuming that her lack of a heavy Brooklyn accent meant she grew up elsewhere. She has an older brother, Leon J. Gross, who works as a psychometric consultant.

In 1968, Gross graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and a Master of Education degree in communications from the University at Buffalo. While in college, she married her high-school boyfriend who attended the same university; they subsequently divorced. She took a year off from school to hitchhike across the country.

In 1972, Gross started teaching 8th grade at an inner-city public junior high school in Buffalo. She said she was ill-equipped for the job, especially at establishing discipline, and was fired after only six weeks.

== Career ==
Gross began her radio career in 1973 at WBFO, an NPR CPB-funded college station, then broadcasting from the Main Street Campus of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, where she started out as a volunteer on a show called &quot;Woman Power&quot;, then co-hosted &quot;This is Radio&quot;. Typical subjects of these shows were women&#x27;s rights and public affairs.

In 1975, she moved to WHYY-FM in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to host and produce &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, which was a local interview program at the time. In 1985, &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot; went national, being distributed weekly by NPR. It became a daily program two years later. Gross typically conducts the interviews from the WHYY-FM studios in Philadelphia, with her subject at the studio of a local NPR affiliate convenient to them connected via telephone or satellite feed. For the majority of these conversations, Gross is not face-to-face with her subjects. Gross creates a daily show that is an hour long, usually includes two interviews, and is distributed to over 190 NPR stations. The show reaches an audience of millions of daily listeners. Many of the producers and staff on Gross&#x27;s show have been with her since the late 1970s to 1980s.

=== Interview style ===
The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that Gross&#x27;s interviews are &quot;a remarkable blend of empathy, warmth, genuine curiosity, and sharp intelligence.&quot; Gross prides herself on preparation; prior to interviewing guests, she reads their books, watches their movies, or listens to their CDs. The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; opined that &quot;Terry Gross ... is almost certainly the best cultural interviewer in America, and one of the best all-around interviewers, period. Her smart, thoughtful questioning pushes her guests in unlikely directions. Her interviews are revelatory in a way other people&#x27;s seldom are.&quot;

Gross said that when she first started working in radio, her voice was much higher with anxiety. For years she took singing lessons, and has worked to relax her voice and to achieve a more natural, deeper tone. Much has been written about Gross&#x27;s voice, and the precision of her use of language has been the subject of much analysis.

=== Difficult interviews ===
There have been some occasions when interviews have not gone smoothly. Gross asked Nancy Reagan about the lack of funding and mishandling of HIV/AIDS by her husband, President Ronald Reagan, which was not well received. Several guests, including Lou Reed, Jann Wenner, Faye Dunaway, Peter Boyle, Monica Lewinsky, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, and Adam Driver, have stopped their interviews prematurely.

Three notable examples are:
* February 4, 2002: Kiss singer and bassist Gene Simmons. The interview began with Gross not pronouncing Simmons&#x27;s original Hebrew last name to his liking. Simmons dismissively replied to her that she pronounced without &quot;flavor&quot; because she had a &quot;Gentile mouth&quot;; Gross responded that she is Jewish. In the interview, Gross asked Simmons about his studded codpiece, to which Simmons replied, &quot;It holds in my manhood, otherwise it would be too much for you to take,&quot; adding, &quot;If you want to welcome me with open arms, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re also going to have to welcome me with open legs,&quot; to which Gross replied, &quot;That&#x27;s a really obnoxious thing to say.&quot; Unlike most &quot;Fresh Air&quot; guests, Simmons refused to grant permission for the interview to be made available on the NPR website. The interview appears in Gross&#x27;s book &quot;All I Did Was Ask&quot;. As of 2024, the interview is currently available in the Fresh Air archive online.
* October 8, 2003: Fox News television host Bill O&#x27;Reilly. O&#x27;Reilly walked out of the interview because of what he considered biased questions, creating a media controversy fed by the ongoing presidential campaign. Toward the end of the interview, O&#x27;Reilly asked Gross if she had been as tough on Al Franken, who had appeared on the program two weeks earlier. Gross responded, &quot;No, I wasn&#x27;t ... we had a different interview.&quot; Gross was later criticized by then NPR ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin for &quot;an interview that was, in the end, unfair to O&#x27;Reilly&quot; and that &quot;it felt as though Terry Gross was indeed &#x27;carrying Al Franken&#x27;s water&#x27;. &quot; Dvorkin described Gross&#x27;s interviewing tactic of reading a quote critical of O&#x27;Reilly after he had walked out of the room as &quot;unethical and unfair&quot;. Gross was later supported by an NPR colleague, Mike Pesca, who contended that O&#x27;Reilly did have the opportunity to respond to a criticism that Gross read to O&#x27;Reilly levelled by &quot;People&quot; magazine, but that he defaulted by prematurely abandoning the interview. On September 24, 2004, Gross and O&#x27;Reilly met again on O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s television show, where Gross assured O&#x27;Reilly, &quot;no matter what you ask me, I&#x27;m staying for the entire interview.&quot;
* February 9, 2005: Lynne Cheney, conservative author and the wife of Vice President Dick Cheney. The initial focus of the interview was on Cheney&#x27;s latest history book, but Gross moved on to questions about Cheney&#x27;s lesbian daughter Mary and her opinion of the Bush administration&#x27;s opposition to same-sex marriage. Cheney declined to comment on her daughter&#x27;s sexuality, but repeatedly stated her opposition to a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which was being endorsed by President George W. Bush. Cheney declined to discuss the matter further. When Gross brought the interview back to issues of gay rights, Cheney again refused to comment. According to producers, Cheney had been warned that Gross would ask about politics and current events.

===Other appearances===
On October 30, 1988, Gross played radio host &quot;Rose Butler&quot; in a remake of the famous &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast of fifty years earlier. The 1988 version was produced by WGBH in Boston and picked up by 150 National Public Radio stations.

Gross appeared as a guest voice on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as herself in the episodes &quot;The Debarted&quot; and &quot;The Girl on the Bus&quot;.

During the spring 1998 semester, Gross was a guest lecturer at University of California-Berkeley&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism.

In 2012, Gross appeared in a short comedic film by Mike Birbiglia titled &quot;The Secret Criminal Life of Terry Gross.&quot;

In 2015 she appeared on &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; and played the game &quot;Not My Job&quot;, answering questions about Hulk Hogan.

In June 2017, Gross appeared as a guest-voice on &quot;Clarence&quot; as Aberdale Public Radio host, Debra Copper, in the episode &quot;Public Radio&quot;.

In January 2020, Gross appeared on the PBS program &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, in which she explored her Jewish heritage. A year prior, host Henry Louis Gates Jr. had been a guest on &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. At the conclusion of their &quot;Fresh Air&quot; interview, Gates invited Gross to appear on &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;.

In 2020, Gross appeared as a fictionalized version of herself in the audiobook version of the Max Brooks novel &quot;Devolution&quot;.

She is the voice of Pam in the HBO Max animated series &quot;The Fungies!&quot;.

== Personal life ==
While she was in college in the late 1960s, Gross was married for about a year to a man she knew from high school, with whom she had been living previously. Gross said she dropped out of college in her sophomore year to hitchhike with him across the country before they were married. She obtained a divorce by the time she started her radio career in 1973.

Gross has been married to Francis Davis, a former jazz critic for &quot;The Village Voice,&quot; since 1994. They have been together since 1978. Davis is Catholic, and Gross is Jewish, but neither is practicing. They reside in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and share a passion for music. They have no children, which Gross has said was a deliberate choice on their part.

<doc id="402640" wikidata="Q502190" url="?curid=402640" title="Duke of Orléans">
<text>Duke of Orléans () was a French royal title usually granted by the King of France to one of his close relatives (usually a younger brother or son), or otherwise inherited through the male line. First created in 1344 by King Philip VI for his younger son Philip, the title was recreated by King Charles VI for his younger brother Louis, who passed the title on to his son and then to his grandson, the latter becoming King Louis XII. The title was created and recreated six times in total, until 1661, when Louis XIV bestowed it upon his younger brother Philippe, who passed it on to his male descendants, who became known as the &quot;Orléans branch&quot; of the Bourbons.

Based at the Palais-Royal, the Duke of Orléans Louis-Philippe II contested the authority of his cousin Louis XVI in the adjacent Louvre. His son would eventually ascend to the throne in 1830 as Louis-Philippe I, King of the French. The descendants of the family are the Orléanist pretenders to the French throne.

Île d&#x27;Orléans, in Canada, is named after Duke of Orléans Henri II, and the city of New Orleans in the United States is named after Duke of Orléans Philippe II.

The holder of the title held the style of Serene Highness.

==House of Valois==
The first Dukedom of Orléans was created for Philip of Valois, seventh son of Philip VI of France and younger brother of John the Good, in 1344. This appanage merged the appanages of Touraine and Valois. However, the first ducal line ended with Philip, who died without legitimate children.

==House of Valois-Orléans==
The second dukedom of Orléans was created in 1392 by Charles VI of France for his younger brother Louis. His role as leading figure in court, regent for his brother during his madness and wealthy landlord, as well as head of the Armagnac party, permitted his descendant to maintain a prominent role in French politics. His grandson Louis XII became king after the extinction of the direct Valois in 1498, while his great-grandson Francis I succeeded the last in 1515. The direct line of Valois-Orléans became extinct with the death of Louis XII in 1515, although the dukedom of Orléans was integrated among the crown&#x27;s properties after his ascent to the throne in 1495.

==House of Valois-Angoulême==
The third dukedom of Orléans was created by Francis I for his second son Henry at his birth. When Henry&#x27;s elder brother and Dauphin, Francis, Duke of Brittany, died childless in 1536, Henry substituted him as Dauphin and ceded the title to his younger brother Charles, Duke of Angoulême, who died childless in 1545.

The fourth dukedom was created by Henry II for his son Louis at his birth. The child duke, however, died one year later, and the title passed to his recently born brother Charles, who became King of France in 1560. The title passed to Charles&#x27; brother, Henry, Duke of Angoulême, who six years later exchanged the appanages of Orléans for the Dukedom of Anjou, becoming the heir &quot;in pectore&quot; of the Crown.

==House of Medici==
After Henry&#x27;s exchange of appanages, Charles IX gave the Orléanais to his mother Catherine, former Queen of France, as reward for her role as regent, mainly about toleration politics. She was the only &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Orléans, so is included among the ruling dukes.

==First House of Bourbon-Orléans==
The fifth dukedom was created in 1626 by Louis XIII for his younger brother Gaston, Duke of Anjou. Gaston became a libertine and scheming figure at court, plotting the assassination of Cardinal Richelieu and later joining the Fronde, a coalition of nobles who opposed the royal centralisation. Finally forgiven by Louis XIII, he died without male heirs, extinguishing the first Bourbon House of Orléans.

&quot;Notes:&quot; the Monsieur d&#x27;Orléans, second son of Henry IV isn&#x27;t included in the list due to his short life (4 years) and lack of official baptism or name.

==Second House of Bourbon-Orléans==

The sixth and final creation was for Philip, Duke of Anjou, who received the Orléanais by his brother Louis XIV. Through his marriage with Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, he established a long dynasty that finally arose to the throne in 1830, with the deposition of Charles X and the proclamation of Louis Philippe I. Louis Philippe passed his title to his son and dauphin, Ferdinand, who died in a carriage accident in 1842.

==Current use==
*Legitimists recognize Jean, Count of Paris, Head of the House of Orléans, as Duke of Orléans, inheriting the title as the heir male of Philip I, Duke of Orléans.
*Orleanists recognize Jacques d&#x27;Orléans, uncle of the Count of Paris, as Duke of Orléans. Per Orleanist-Unionist reckoning, the title merged with the crown in 1883 and was subsequently granted to Jacques upon his marriage in 1969.

<doc id="402647" wikidata="Q1305251" url="?curid=402647" title="Black rosy finch">
<text>The black rosy finch or black rosy-finch (Leucosticte atrata) is a species of passerine bird in the family Fringillidae native to alpine areas above treeline, of the western United States. It is the most range-restricted member of its genus, and a popular photography subject for birdwatchers.

==Taxonomy==
The black rosy finch was first classified by American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1874. This bird has been thought to form a superspecies with the three other rosy finches: grey-crowned rosy finch &quot;(L. tephrocotis)&quot; and the brown-capped rosy finch &quot;(L. australis)&quot;, all of which were classified as the same species as the Asian rosy finch &quot;(L. arctoa)&quot; from 1983–1993. Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another. Along with four Asian rosy finches, the three North American rosy finches form the mountain finch genus &quot;Leucosticte&quot;. There are no recognized subspecies of the black rosy finch. Alternative common names include: &quot;roselin&quot; (in French), &quot;Rußschneegimpel&quot; (in German), and &quot;pinzón montano negro&quot; (in Spanish).

==Description==
Adults are black on the head, back and breast with pink on the belly, rump and wings. There is a patch of grey at the back of the head. They have short black legs and a long forked tail. The grey-crowned rosy finch has a brown body instead of black and the brown-capped rosy finch and lacks the grey patch on the back of the head.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black rosy finch&#x27;s breeding habitat is mountain areas above the tree-line, amongst alpine rocks and cliffs. Because of this it is one of the least studied birds in North America. Its distribution range is between that of the grey-crowned rosy finch (&quot;L. tephrocotis&quot;), which is located to north and west, and the brown-capped rosy finch (&quot;L. australis&quot;), which is located to the south and east.

The paucity of definitive information about its breeding distribution lead the Wildlife Action Plan Joint Team of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to designate the finch a &quot;species of greatest conservation need&quot; in Utah.

==Behavior==
The black rosy finch builds a cup nest in a cavity on a cliff. Most birds migrate short distances to lower elevations and further south and return to the alpine areas in April. These birds forage on the ground, may fly to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat seeds from weeds and grasses and insects, often in areas where snow is melting, uncovering food items and new plant shoots are growing. They often feed in small flocks, sometimes mixing with grey-crowned rosy finches. A male will defend its female&#x27;s territory during breeding season, not just the nest but where ever she goes. This behavior is common with the rosy finches. When breeding both males and females develop throat pouches, known as gular pouches or gular skin, to carry food to their chicks, a trait seen in only one other North American genus, &quot;Pinicola&quot;. Due to their inaccessibility, actual black rosy finch nests had been reached by only three researchers as of 2002. The nests are made of grass and stems and lined with fine grass, hair, and feathers. They are known to use protected areas such as openings in cliffs, mine shafts, caves, and rafters. They eat seeds and insects, usually foraged from the ground, including snowfields. Their call is a buzz-sounding &quot;chew&quot;.

<text>Hoarding disorder (HD) or [[Plyushkin]]&#x27;s disorder is a mental disorder characterised by persistent difficulty in parting with possessions and engaging in excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which no space is available. This results in severely cluttered living spaces, distress, and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Excessive acquisition is characterized by repetitive urges or behaviours related to amassing or buying property. Difficulty discarding possessions is characterized by a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them. Accumulation of possessions results in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that their use or safety is compromised. It is recognised by the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5).

Prevalence rates are estimated at 2% to 5% in adults, though the condition typically manifests in childhood with symptoms worsening in advanced age, at which point collected items have grown excessive and family members who would otherwise help to maintain and control the levels of clutter have either died or moved away.

People with hoarding disorder commonly live with other complex and/or psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Other factors often associated with hoarding include alcohol dependence and paranoid, schizotypal and avoidant traits.

== Diagnosis==

Collecting and hoarding may seem similar, but there are distinct characteristics that set the behaviors apart. Collecting is a hobby often involving the targeted search and acquisition of specific items that form—at least from the perspective of the collector—a greater appreciation, deeper understanding, or increased synergistic value when combined with other similar items. Hoarding, by contrast, typically appears haphazard and involves the overall acquiring of common items that would not be especially meaningful to the person who is gathering such items in large quantities. People who hoard keep common items that hold little to no meaning or value to others, unlike some collectors, whose items may be of great value to select people. Most hoarders are disorganized, and their living areas are crowded and in disarray. Most collectors can afford to store their items systematically or to have enough room to display their collections. Age, mental state, or finances have caused some collectors to fall into a hoarding state.

== The Clutter Image Rating ==

A UK charity called Hoarding UK has found that people have very different ideas about what it means to have a cluttered home. For some, a small pile of things in the corner of an otherwise well-ordered room constitutes serious clutter. For others, only when the narrow pathways make it hard to get through a room does the clutter register. To ensure an accurate sense of a clutter problem and encourage people to get support, Hoarding UK uses the Clutter Image Rating, created by R. O. Frost and G. Steketee, a series of pictures of rooms in various stages of clutter—from completely clutter-free to very severely cluttered.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of hoarding disorder is estimated to be between 2 and 6 percent, although some surveys indicate the lifetime prevalence may be as high as 14%. First-degree relatives of those with hoarding disorder are significantly more likely to report hoarding symptoms, and hoarding likely comes about due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Rates of hoarding increase significantly with age, and people over the age of 54 are three times as likely to meet criteria for hoarding disorder. However, hoarding symptoms typically manifest in early childhood, and worsen to the point of becoming clinically significant during middle age. Over half of hoarders report the onset of hoarding as being associated with a traumatic life event, and in this portion of hoarders, the age of onset is much higher. Epidemiological studies have found that hoarding is twice as common in males, although clinical studies on hoarding tend to be predominantly female, suggesting that male hoarders are a significantly understudied and under-treated population.

Hoarding is a significant problem around the world and can pose a public health risk when hoarding escalates enough to damage the integrity of a structure or attract vermin. Accumulated items can block exits during fires and increase the risk of injury. In Japan, hoarder houses are known as , and have become a topic of public alarm in Japanese mass media. In the Eastern United States, they are sometimes called Collyer mansions or Collyers, after the infamous Collyer brothers.

=== Comorbidity ===
Under the DSM-IV, hoarding was listed as a symptom of obsessive–compulsive personality disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder; however, hoarding was found to have a relatively weak connection to OCD or OCPD compared to their other symptoms. Due to this evidence, hoarding disorder was separated as its own disorder in the DSM-5. However, hoarding does frequently co-occur with OCD. OCD patients with hoarding symptoms were found to display a distinct form of hoarding in which they were more likely to hoard &quot;bizarre items&quot; and perform compulsive rituals associated with their hoarding behavior, such as rituals around checking items or rituals to be performed before discarding them.

However, the majority of hoarders do not show OCD symptoms. Hoarding has been found to be correlated with depression, social anxiety, compulsive grooming disorders such as trichotillomania, bipolar disorder, reduced cognitive and affective empathy and compulsive shopping. Hoarders have higher than average rates of traumatic past events, particularly those associated with loss or deprivation. Past events which occurred before the onset of hoarding are correlated to a subject&#x27;s emotional attachment to physical objects, and past events after the onset of hoarding increase a subject&#x27;s anxiety around memory. Hoarders are also more likely to have a past with alcohol abuse.

The prevalence of different comorbidities is influenced by gender. In men, hoarding is associated with generalized anxiety disorder and tics, while among women, hoarding is associated with social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and compulsive grooming behaviors like nail-biting and skin-picking.

== Studies ==
In a 2010 study using data from self-reports of hoarding behavior from 751 participants, it was found most reported the onset of their hoarding symptoms between the ages of 11 and 20 years old, with 70% reporting the behaviors before the age of 21. Fewer than 4% of people reported the onset of their symptoms after the age of 40. The data showed that compulsive hoarding usually begins early, but often does not become more prominent until after age 40. Different reasons have been given for this, such as the effects of family presence earlier in life and limits on hoarding imposed by housing situation and lifestyle. The understanding of early onset hoarding behavior may help in the future to better distinguish hoarding behavior from &quot;normal&quot; childhood collecting behaviors.

A second key part of this study was to determine if stressful life events are linked to the onset of hoarding symptoms. Similar to self-harming, traumatized persons may create a problem for themselves in order to avoid their real anxiety or trauma. Facing their real issues may be too difficult for them, so they create an artificial problem (in their case, hoarding) and prefer to battle with it rather than determine, face, or do something about their real anxieties. Hoarders may suppress their psychological pain by hoarding. The study shows that adults who hoard report a greater lifetime incidence of having possessions taken by force, forced sexual activity as either an adult or a child, including forced sexual intercourse, and being physically handled roughly during childhood, thus proving traumatic events are positively correlated with the severity of hoarding. For each five years of life the participant would rate the severity of their hoarding symptoms from 1 to 4, 4 being the most severe. Of the participants, 548 reported a chronic course, 159 an increasing course and 39 people, a decreasing course of illness. The incidents of increased hoarding behavior were usually correlated to five categories of stressful life events.

Although excessive acquiring is not a diagnostic criterion of hoarding, at least two-thirds of individuals with hoarding disorder excessively acquire possessions. Having a more anxiously attached interpersonal style is associated with more compulsive buying and greater acquisition of free items and these relationships are mediated by stronger distress intolerance and greater anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism has been shown to increase both the sentimental value and perceived utility of items. These findings indicate that individuals may over-value their possessions to compensate for thwarted interpersonal needs. Feeling alone and/or disconnected from others may impair people&#x27;s ability to tolerate distress and increase people&#x27;s tendencies to see human-like qualities in objects. The humanness of items may increase their perceived value and individuals may acquire these valued objects to alleviate distress. Individuals with hoarding problems have been shown to have greater interpersonal problems than individuals who only excessively acquire possessions, which provides some support for the assumption that individuals with hoarding problems may have a stronger motivation to hang onto possessions for support. As possessions cannot provide support in the way humans can and because saving excessively can frustrate other people due to its impact on their quality of life, individuals with hoarding disorder may be caught in a feedback loop. They may save to alleviate distress, but this saving may cause distress, which may lead them to keep saving to alleviate the distress.

== Treatment ==
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a commonly implemented therapeutic intervention for compulsive hoarding. As part of cognitive behavior therapy, the therapist may help the patient to:
* Discover why one is compelled to hoard.
* Learn to organize possessions in order to decide what to discard.
* Develop decision-making skills.
* Declutter the home during in-home visits by a therapist or professional organizer.
* Gain and perform relaxation skills.
* Attend family and/or group therapy.
* Be open to trying psychiatric hospitalization if the hoarding is serious.
* Have periodic visits and consultations to keep a healthy lifestyle.

This modality of treatment usually involves exposure and response prevention to situations that cause anxiety and cognitive restructuring of beliefs related to hoarding. Furthermore, research has also shown that certain CBT protocols have been more effective in treatment than others. CBT programs that specifically address the motivation of the affected person, organization, acquiring new clutter, and removing current clutter from the home have shown promising results. This type of treatment typically involves in-home work with a therapist combined with between-session homework, the completion of which is associated with better treatment outcomes. Research on internet-based CBT treatments for the disorder (where participants have access to educational resources, cognitive strategies, and chat groups) has also shown promising results both in terms of short- and long-term recovery.

Other therapeutic approaches that have been found to be helpful:
# Motivational interviewing originated in addiction therapy. This method is significantly helpful when used in hoarding cases in which insight is poor and ambivalence to change is marked.
# Harm reduction rather than symptom reduction. Also borrowed from addiction therapy. The goal is to decrease the harmful implications of the behavior, rather than the hoarding behaviors.
# Group psychotherapy reduces social isolation and social anxiety and is cost-effective compared to one-on-one intervention. Group CBT tends to have similar outcomes to individual therapy. Although group treatment often does not include home sessions, experimental research suggests that treatment outcomes may be improved if home sessions are included. Individuals have been shown to discard more possessions when in a cluttered environment compared to a tidy environment. Indeed, a meta-analysis found that a greater number of home sessions improves CBT outcomes.

Individuals with hoarding behaviors are often described as having low motivation and poor compliance levels, and as being indecisive and procrastinators, which may frequently lead to premature termination (i.e., dropout) or low response to treatment. Therefore, it was suggested that future treatment approaches, and pharmacotherapy in particular, be directed to address the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairments demonstrated by individuals with hoarding symptoms.

Mental health professionals frequently express frustration regarding hoarding cases, mostly due to premature termination and poor response to treatment. Patients are frequently described as indecisive, procrastinators, recalcitrant, and as having low or no motivation, which can explain why many interventions fail to accomplish significant results. To overcome this obstacle, some clinicians recommend accompanying individual therapy with home visits to help the clinician: 

Likewise, certain cases are assisted by professional organizers as well.

== In popular culture ==
Emily Maguire wrote &quot;Love Objects&quot; in 2021, a novel about a woman with hoarding disorder that focused on the behavior and the consequences of a hoarder being exposed.

There have been several television shows that focused on those suspected to have hoarding disorder. &quot;Hoarders&quot;, an ongoing series by A&amp;E, focuses on helping one or two individual &quot;hoarders&quot; per episode and features a rotating cast of professional psychologists and organizers who specialize in hoarding disorder. A similar show, &quot;&quot; ran from 2010 to 2014 on TLC. &quot;Hoarders: Canada&quot; followed a similar format to &quot;Hoarders&quot; and &quot;Hoarding: Buried Alive.&quot; &quot;Britain&#x27;s Biggest Hoarders&quot; is an ongoing series hosted by Jasmine Harman, the daughter of a hoarder, and follows her as she and a team of experts seek to help others with the disorder. &quot;The Hoarder Next Door&quot; is a four-part series based in Britain that followed a group of hoarders participating in a treatment program led by psychotherapist Stelios Kiosses. &quot;Confessions: Animal Hoarding&quot; is a six-episode series aired on Animal Planet that focused on those who hoard animals and their living conditions. &quot;Hoarder House Flippers&quot; is more focused on the hoarded house, where teams work hard to flip properties that have been hoarded.

There have been possible depictions of hoarding in literature before the diagnosis was created. In Nikolai Gogol’s book &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (1842), wealthy Plyushkin displays hoarding behaviors. For example, he serves an old cake from years ago to a business partner, having a servant scrape off the mold. He is famous among the locals for his compulsion to find and keep items.

&quot;Le Cousin Pons&quot;, a novella written by Honoré de Balzac in 1846, features Pons, who hoards art and antiques. He collected relatively low-value items, hoping they would become more valuable with time. However, he is unwilling to part with any of his items even when he becomes destitute. He dies with his collection intact.

In Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1862), London shop owner Krook hoards items, primarily legal documents. He continues to buy items but doesn&#x27;t sell any, even though he claims he buys to sell later for a profit. Several documents that would resolve a legal case central to the novel&#x27;s plot are lost among his hoard.

<doc id="402653" wikidata="Q653368" url="?curid=402653" title="District attorney">
<text>In the United States, a district attorney (DA), county attorney, county prosecutor, state&#x27;s attorney, prosecuting attorney, commonwealth&#x27;s attorney, or solicitor is the chief prosecutor or chief law enforcement officer representing a U.S. state in a local government area, typically a county or a group of counties. The exact scope of the office varies by state. Generally, the prosecutor is said to represent the people of the jurisdiction in the state&#x27;s courts, typically in criminal matters, against defendants. District attorneys are elected in almost all states, and the role is generally partisan. This is unlike similar roles in other common law jurisdictions, where chief prosecutors are appointed based on merit and expected to be politically independent.

The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case against an individual suspected of breaking the state&#x27;s criminal law, initiating and directing further criminal investigations, guiding and recommending the sentencing of offenders, and are the only attorneys allowed to participate in grand jury proceedings. The prosecutors decide what criminal charges to bring, and when and where a person will answer to those charges. In carrying out their duties, prosecutors have the authority to investigate persons, grant immunity to witnesses and accused criminals, and plea bargain with defendants.

A district attorney or state attorney leads an office of other prosecutors and related staff. Staff attorneys are most commonly known as assistant district attorneys (ADAs) or deputy district attorneys (DDAs); in states where the head of office is called state attorney the staff attorneys are usually referred to as Assistant State Attorney (ASAs) Most prosecutions will be delegated to the assistant attorneys, with the head-of-office sometimes prosecuting the most important cases and having overall responsibility for the agency and its work. Most criminal matters in the United States are handled in state judicial systems, but a comparable office for the United States Federal government is the United States Attorney.

In most states, DAs are directly elected. They are appointed In Alaska, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the District of Columbia, the United States Attorney is responsible for prosecuting offenses under the DC Code, in addition to prosecuting federal offenses.

== History ==
This term for a prosecutor originates with the traditional use of the term &quot;district&quot; for multi-county prosecutorial jurisdictions in several U.S. states. For example, New York appointed prosecutors to multi-county districts prior to 1813. Even after those states broke up such districts and started appointing or electing prosecutors for individual counties, they continued to use the title &quot;district attorney&quot; for the most senior prosecutor in a county rather than switch to &quot;county attorney&quot;.

== Role ==
The principal duties of the district attorney are usually mandated by law and include representing the State in all criminal trials for crimes which occurred in the district attorney&#x27;s geographical jurisdiction. The geographical jurisdiction of a district attorney may be delineated by the boundaries of a county, judicial circuit, or judicial district.

Their duties generally include charging crimes through informations or grand jury indictments. After levying criminal charges, the state&#x27;s attorney will then prosecute those charged with a crime. This includes conducting discovery, plea bargaining, and trial.

In some jurisdictions, the district attorney may act as chief counsel for city police, county police, state police and all state law enforcement agencies within the state&#x27;s attorney&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In some jurisdictions, the district attorney oversees the operations of local prosecutors with respect to violations of county ordinances. In other jurisdictions, the district attorney prosecutes traffic matters or misdemeanors. In some states the district attorney prosecutes violations of state laws to the extent that the state permits local prosecution of these. District attorneys do not prosecute federal crimes, which are the jurisdiction of a United States Attorney.

Many district attorneys also bear responsibilities not related to criminal prosecution. These include defending the county against civil suits, occasionally initiating such suits on behalf of the county, preparing or reviewing contracts entered into by the county and providing legal advice and counsel to local government. In some jurisdictions, the county attorney does not handle any criminal matters at all, but serves only as the legal counsel to the county.

For example, in Arizona, Missouri, Montana, and Minnesota a county attorney represents the county and state within their county, prosecutes all felonies occurring within the county, and prosecutes misdemeanors occurring within unincorporated areas of the county. Minnesota county attorneys also prosecute all juvenile cases, regardless of severity. In Ohio a county prosecutor represents the county and state within their county, prosecutes all crimes within the county, and is legal adviser to the board of county commissioners, board of elections, and all other county officers and boards. On the other hand, county attorneys in Kentucky and Virginia prosecute only certain misdemeanors and sometimes traffic matters and serve as legal counsel for their county, with felony prosecutions and prosecutions of offenses not handled by the county attorney being the responsibility of the commonwealth&#x27;s attorney for the given county.

== Departments ==
The district attorney usually divides their services into several departments that handle different areas of criminal law. Each department is staffed by several duly appointed and sworn ASAs. The departments of a large district attorney&#x27;s office may include but are not limited to: felony, misdemeanor, domestic violence, traffic, juvenile, charging (or case filing), drug prosecution, forfeitures, civil affairs such as eminent domain, child advocacy, child support, victim assistance, appeals, career criminal prosecution, homicide, investigations, organized crime/gang, and administration.

== Nomenclature ==
The name of the role of local prosecutor may vary by state or jurisdiction based on whether they serve a county or a multi-county district, the responsibility to represent the state or county in addition to prosecution, or local historical customs.

&quot;District attorney&quot; and &quot;assistant district attorney&quot; are the most common titles for state prosecutors, and are used by jurisdictions within the United States including California, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.

&quot;State&#x27;s attorney&quot; or &quot;state attorney&quot; is used in Connecticut, Florida (state attorney), Illinois, Maryland, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont. In Maryland, the roles of Assistant and Deputy are reversed from those used in &quot;District Attorney&quot; jurisdictions, with Deputy State&#x27;s Attorney being the primary subordinate to the elected State&#x27;s Attorney and Assistant State&#x27;s Attorneys (ASA) being the line-level prosecutors of the office.

In Virginia, the title is &quot;commonwealth&#x27;s attorney&quot;. Kentucky splits the role between two officials—by statute, the &quot;commonwealth&#x27;s attorney&quot; serves in the Circuit Court (the court of general jurisdiction), and the &quot;county attorney&quot; serves in the limited-jurisdiction District Court, although the two officials may enter into a written agreement to split their duties as they see fit. Commonwealth&#x27;s attorneys are elected in their respective jurisdictions in both Virginia and Kentucky for terms of four years and six years, respectively. Kentucky&#x27;s county attorneys are elected in their jurisdictions to four-year terms.

&quot;County attorney&quot; is used in Arizona, Missouri, Montana, Minnesota, and New Hampshire. Note that in other states the &quot;county attorney&quot; represents the county in civil matters, whereas the &quot;district attorney&quot; prosecutes crimes.

&quot;Solicitor&quot;, or more fully a &quot;circuit solicitor&quot;, is the term South Carolina uses to refers to its prosecutors. One solicitor is elected for each of the state&#x27;s 16 judicial circuits, consisting of two to five counties. Appointed assistants to a circuit solicitor are &quot;assistant solicitors&quot;.

In St. Louis, Missouri, the title is &quot;circuit attorney&quot;, while in St. Louis County, Missouri, the title is &quot;prosecuting attorney&quot;.

==Assistant district attorney ==

The assistant district attorney (assistant DA, ADA), or state prosecutor or assistant state&#x27;s attorney, is a law enforcement official who represents the state government on behalf of the district attorney in investigating and prosecuting individuals alleged to have committed a crime. In carrying out their duties to enforce state and local laws, ADA have the authority to investigate persons, issue subpoenas, file formal criminal charges, plea bargain with defendants, and grant immunity to witnesses and accused criminals.

&quot;Administrative assistant district attorney&quot; (admin ADA), &quot;executive assistant district attorney&quot; (exec ADA), &quot;chief assistant district attorney&quot; (chief ADA), or &quot;first assistant district attorney&quot; (First ADA) are some of the titles given to the senior ADA leadership working under the DA. The chief ADA, Executive ADA, or first ADA, depending on the office, is generally considered the second-in-command, and usually reports directly to the DA. The exact roles and job assignments for each title vary with each individual office, but generally include management of the daily activities and supervision of specialized divisions within the office. Often, a senior ADA may oversee or prosecute some of the larger crimes within the jurisdiction. In some offices, the Exec ADA has the responsibility of hiring lawyers and support staff, as well as supervising press-releases and overseeing the work of the office.

The salary of an ADA will be lower than the elected DA. The non-monetary benefits of the job induce many to work as an ADA; these include the opportunity to amass trial experience, perform a public service, and network professionally. Upon leaving employment as an ADA, persons seek employment as a judge, in private law firms, or as U.S. Attorneys.

== Appeals ==
Depending on state law, appeals are moved to appellate courts (also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts in some states). During the appeals process district attorneys, in many cases, hands all relative prosecutorial materials to a state appellate prosecutor who in turn will represent the state in appellate courts with the advice and consent of the district attorney. In other cases, such as in New York, the District Attorney&#x27;s Office will have in-house appellate prosecutors who handle appeals.

==District attorney investigators==
Some district attorneys maintain their own law enforcement arm whose members are sworn peace officers. Depending on the jurisdiction, they are referred to as &quot;district attorney investigators&quot; or &quot;county detectives&quot;.

== Other countries ==
In England and Wales, the vast majority of criminal prosecutions are prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is appointed by the Attorney General for England and Wales. Within the CPS, 14 Chief Crown Prosecutors, answering to the DPP, head regional teams of Crown Prosecutors. With the exception of the AG and Solicitor General for England and Wales, no prosecutors are political officials in England and Wales and no prosecutor in England and Wales is a law enforcement official by virtue of their job.

In Canada, the equivalent position to a district attorney is a &quot;crown attorney&quot;, &quot;crown counsel&quot; or &quot;crown prosecutor&quot; depending on the province, and the equivalent to an assistant district attorney is the assistant crown attorney, assistant crown counsel or assistant crown prosecutor respectively. Some provinces appoint a Director of Public Prosecutions. 

In India, the equivalent position to a District Attorney is typically called a &quot;Public Prosecutor.&quot; Public Prosecutors represent the state in criminal cases and are responsible for prosecuting individuals accused of committing crimes. They work under the supervision of the Director of Prosecutions or the Advocate General at the state level, depending on the specific legal framework of the state.

<doc id="402657" wikidata="Q2996339" url="?curid=402657" title="Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals">
<text>The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) is part of the Antarctic Treaty System. It was signed at the conclusion of a multilateral conference in London on 11 February 1972.

== Contents ==
CCAS had the objective &quot;to promote and achieve the protection, scientific study, and rational use of Antarctic seals, and to maintain a satisfactory balance within the ecological system of Antarctica.

CCAS forbids the killing or capture of Antarctic seals except in specific circumstances. The contracting parties of CCAS may decide the standards for killing and capture as dynamics of the seal populations change, and these decisions should be &quot;based upon the best scientific and technical evidence available&quot;.

CCAS also mandates communication between the different countries that signed it regarding all research, hunting, and capture of seals. The scientific aspect of this communication is done through the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

=== Scope ===
The geographic range of the agreement covers all seas south of 60°S latitude. It protects the following seal species:

* &quot;Mirounga leonina&quot; Southern elephant seal
* &quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot; Leopard seal
* &quot;Leptonychotes weddelli&quot; Weddell seal
* &quot;Lobodon carcinophagus&quot; Crabeater seal
* &quot;Ommatophoca rossi&quot; Ross seal
* &quot;Arctocephalus sp.&quot; Southern fur seals

At the time of creation, all fur seals in the Antarctic area where in the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;, however since then many species formerly in that genus have been reclassified under &quot;Arctophoca&quot; with only &quot;A. pusillus&quot; remaining.

== History ==
Shortly after the discovery of Antarctica, people began hunting seals at an unsustainable rate. Many species were close to extinction before the signing of CCAS.

It was opened for ratification on 1 June 1972, and entered into force on 11 March 1978.

The 17 parties to CCAS are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States. New Zealand has signed, but not ratified the convention.

The countries meet at least every five years after 1972 to review CCAS, as is mandated in Article 7.

<text>Alan Richard Michaels (born November 12, 1944) is an American television play-by-play sportscaster for &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; on Amazon Prime Video and in an emeritus role for NBC Sports. He has worked on network sports television since 1971, with his most recent work being with NBC Sports after nearly three decades (1976–2006) with ABC Sports. Michaels is known for his many years calling play-by-play of National Football League (NFL) games, including &quot;ABC Monday Night Football&quot; from 1986 to 2005 and &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; from 2006 to 2021. He is also known for famous calls in other sports, including the Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Winter Olympics and the earthquake-interrupted Game 3 of the 1989 World Series.

==Early life and education==
Alan Richard Michaels was born on November 12, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. Michaels was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, to Jay Leonard Michaels and Lila Roginsky/Ross. He grew up as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. In 1958, Michaels&#x27; family moved to Los Angeles, the same year the Dodgers left Brooklyn. He graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in 1962. Michaels attended Arizona State University, where he majored in radio and television and minored in journalism. He worked as a sports writer for ASU&#x27;s independent student newspaper, &quot;The State Press&quot;, and called Sun Devils football, basketball, and baseball games for the campus radio station. He also is a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.

===Early career===
Michaels&#x27;s first job in television was with Chuck Barris Productions, choosing women to appear on &quot;The Dating Game&quot;. His first sportscasting job came in 1967, when he was hired to do public relations for the Los Angeles Lakers and serve as a color commentator on the team&#x27;s radio broadcasts alongside veteran play-by-play announcer Chick Hearn. However, he was terminated after appearing on just four games due to Chick Hearn&#x27;s displeasure on working with someone so young.

He resumed his broadcasting career in 1968 after moving to Honolulu, where he worked as a sports anchor for KHVH-TV (now KITV) and called play-by-play for the Hawaii Islanders baseball team in the Pacific Coast League as well as the University of Hawaii&#x27;s football and basketball teams and local high school football games. He was named Hawaii&#x27;s &#x27;Sportscaster of the Year&#x27; in 1969. In 1970, Michaels appeared as attorney Dave Bronstein in an episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; called &quot;Run, Johnny, Run&quot; (Air date: January 14, 1970); the episode also featured a young Christopher Walken.

In 1971, Michaels moved to Cincinnati, where he became the radio play-by-play announcer for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball. In 1972, after the Reds won the National League Championship Series and advanced to the World Series, he helped to cover the Fall Classic for NBC Sports. He also was the network&#x27;s play-by-play man for the hockey coverage at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan.

In December 1973, after Bill Enis, an NBC sports announcer and sportscaster for KPRC-TV in Houston had died from a heart attack at the age of 39 two days before he was to call the regular-season NFL finale between the Houston Oilers and Cincinnati Bengals, Michaels was brought in to replace Enis in the booth with Dave Kocourek.

In 1974, he left the Reds for a similar position with the San Francisco Giants and also covered basketball for UCLA, replacing Dick Enberg on the Bruins&#x27; tape delayed telecasts of their home games, during a period when UCLA was in the midst of an 88-game winning streak. He left NBC that year and announced regional NFL games for CBS Sports in 1975. In 1976 he joined ABC Sports part-time to call the network&#x27;s backup &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; games. That year, he called two no-hitters: by the Pirates&#x27; John Candelaria vs. Los Angeles on August 9 (for ABC) and the Giants&#x27; John Montefusco at Atlanta on September 29, 1976 (for Giants radio).

==ABC Sports (1977–2006)==
In January 1977, Michaels signed with ABC Sports on a full-time basis. In 1983, he became the network&#x27;s lead baseball announcer, replacing Keith Jackson. Up until that point, Michaels and Jackson would split play–by–play duties for ABC&#x27;s coverage of the World Series beginning in 1979, with Michaels assigned to call the games from the National League park and Jackson calling games from the American League park.

Over the next three decades, Michaels covered a wide variety of sports for ABC, including Major League Baseball, college football (working alongside the likes of Frank Broyles, Lee Grosscup, and Ara Parseghian from 1977–1985 and later, his &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; colleagues Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf for the Sugar Bowl from 1989 to 1992), college basketball (normally teaming with Joe B. Hall from 1987–1989), the Indianapolis 500, ice hockey, track and field events, horse racing (including the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes from 1986 to 2000), golf, boxing (such as the 1985 Marvin Hagler/Thomas Hearns fight), figure skating (working alongside Dick Button and Peggy Fleming), road cycling (Michaels in particular, provided commentary for those events at the 1984 Summer Olympics with Greg LeMond and Eric Heiden), and many events of the Olympic Games as well as the Olympic trials.

Other prominent events that Michaels covered for ABC included serving as the studio host for the Stanley Cup Finals from –. Also, he served as host for the yearly Tiger Woods Monday night specials that aired in July or August.

Episodes of &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; featuring Michaels early in his ABC career have been featured at least two occasions on the ESPN Classic comedy series &quot;Cheap Seats&quot;.

===The Miracle on Ice===

Two of Michaels&#x27;s more famous broadcasts were of the 1980 Winter Olympics ice hockey medal round match between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the attempted third game of the 1989 World Series.

In 1980, an unheralded group of college ice hockey players from the United States won the gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games. The medal round match on February 22—which, contrary to popular belief, did not yet assure the team of the gold medal—was of particular interest, as it was played against a heavily favored professional squad from the Soviet Union, and was in front of an incredibly excited pro-American crowd in Lake Placid, New York. Michaels&#x27;s memorable broadcast of this game, including his interjection—&quot;Do you believe in miracles? YES!&quot;—as time expired on the 4–3 United States victory, earned the game the media nickname of &quot;The Miracle on Ice&quot;.

Most assume that the game was broadcast live (indeed, CTV, which held Canadian rights to the game, aired it live); but in reality, the game started at 5:05 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and ABC decided against pre-empting local and network news (on the East Coast) to carry the game live. Instead, most of it—including the entire third period—was broadcast within the regularly scheduled, prime-time telecast from 8:30 to 11 p.m. Eastern time (and on a six-and-a-half-hour delay on the West Coast from 8:30 to 11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time). Despite being on tape, the game was one of the highest-rated programs of the 1979–80 television season and remains the most-watched ice hockey game in the history of American television.

Michaels, along with broadcasting partner Ken Dryden, recreated their Olympic commentary in the 2004 film &quot;Miracle&quot;. Although Michaels and Dryden recreated the bulk of their commentary for the film, the closing seconds of the game against the Soviet Union used the original ABC Sports commentary from 1980. Gavin O&#x27;Connor, the director of &quot;Miracle&quot;, decided to use the last 10 seconds of Michaels&#x27;s original &quot;Do you believe in miracles? YES!&quot; call in the film because he felt he couldn&#x27;t ask him to recreate the emotion he experienced at that moment. Thus they cleaned up the recording to make the transition to the authentic call as seamless as possible.

Michaels later recalled, &quot;When I look back, obviously Lake Placid would be the highlight of my career. I can&#x27;t think of anything that would ever top it. I can&#x27;t dream up a scenario.&quot;

Michaels was only on this particular assignment because he had done one hockey game, eight years prior. The game in question was the gold medal game (the Soviet Union vs. Czechoslovakia) of the 1972 Winter Olympics (on NBC) in Sapporo, Japan. Other announcers on the ABC Sports roster such as Keith Jackson, Frank Gifford, and Howard Cosell had never done a hockey game before. Michaels recalled this during a &quot;Real Sports&quot; interview in January 2009. Michaels also apparently beat out WABC-AM and New York Islanders commentator George Michael for the assignment.

Two days later, Michaels would broadcast the gold medal game, in which the United States defeated Finland, closing the game out by declaring &quot;This impossible dream comes true!&quot;

Al Michaels continued serving as ABC&#x27;s lead play-by-play announcer for their ice hockey coverage for their next two Winter Olympics, both with Dryden, the lead color commentator. In 1984 from Sarajevo, Mike Eruzione, who was the captain of the gold medal-winning United States ice hockey team from 1980, primarily worked with Don Chevrier. For ABC&#x27;s final Winter Olympics four years later, Eruzione was this time, paired with Jiggs McDonald.

Michaels along with John Davidson would later call Games 1 and 4 of the Calgary–Los Angeles Stanley Cup playoff series in 1993 for ABC.

===Memorable baseball moments===
====1972 National League Championship Series====

Even though the events of October 17, 1989, in San Francisco are widely considered to be the most dramatic baseball-related moment of Michaels&#x27;s career, he had several others that were memorable.

In the 1972 National League Championship Series, the defending World Series Champion Pittsburgh Pirates faced the Cincinnati Reds. In Game 5, with both teams tied at two games apiece, the Pirates led 3–2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and were three outs away from advancing to the World Series. But Pirates closer Dave Giusti unraveled. He surrendered a game-tying home run to Johnny Bench before allowing back-to-back singles to Tony Pérez and Denis Menke before being relieved by Bob Moose, who almost worked out of the jam by recording two outs.

But with pinch-hitter Hal McRae at the plate, Moose lost his footing and uncorked a wild pitch sending George Foster, who was pinch running for Pérez, home with the pennant-clinching run and setting off a massive celebration at Riverfront Stadium.

As previously mentioned, later that October, Michaels participated in his first ever World Series as a broadcaster, where he assisted NBC&#x27;s Curt Gowdy for Games 1–2, 6, and 7 in Cincinnati. Michaels was a product of the then broadcasting policy of announcers who represented the participating teams (a process that ended following the 1976 World Series) being invited to do televised network play–by–play for the World Series. As such, Games 3–5 of the 1972 World Series instead, featured Oakland Athletics broadcaster Monte Moore working for NBC alongside Curt Gowdy.

====1983 World Series====

On June 6, 1983, Michaels officially succeeded Keith Jackson as the lead play-by-play announcer for &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot;. Michaels, who spent seven seasons working backup games (initially teaming with Bob Gibson and Norm Cash), was apparently very miffed over ABC Sports&#x27; delay in announcing him as its top baseball announcer. Unlike Jackson, whose forte was college football, Michaels as previously mentioned, had gigs with the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants before joining ABC in 1976. &quot;TV Guide&quot; huffed about Jackson by saying &quot;A football guy, on baseball!&quot; Jackson was unavailable for several World Series games in and because of conflicts with his otherwise normal college football broadcasting schedule. Thus, Michaels did play-by-play for games on weekends.

====1986 American League Championship Series====

In 1986, Michaels was also on hand for what he says was &quot;the greatest of all the thousands of games I&#x27;ve done.&quot; On October 12 at Anaheim Stadium, Michaels along with Jim Palmer called Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. The California Angels held a 3 games to 1 lead of a best-of-seven against the Boston Red Sox. In the game, the Angels held a 5–2 lead going into the ninth inning. Boston scored two runs on a home run by Don Baylor, closing the gap to 5–4.

When Donnie Moore came in to shut down the rally, there were two outs, and a runner on first base, Rich Gedman, who had been hit by a pitch. The Angels were one out from their first-ever trip to the World Series. But Dave Henderson hit a 2–2 pitch off Moore for a home run, giving the Red Sox a 6–5 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore continued to pitch for the Angels. He was able to stifle a 10th inning Red Sox rally by getting Jim Rice to ground into a double play. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th-inning via a sacrifice fly by Henderson. The Angels could not score in the bottom of the 11th and lost the game 7–6.
The defeat still left the Angels in a 3 games to 2 advantage, with two more games to play at Fenway Park. The Angels were not able to recover, losing both games by wide margins, 10–4 and 8–1. Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS ended with Calvin Schiraldi striking out Jerry Narron.

Despite the fact that ABC Sports and ESPN have been under the same corporate umbrella (The Walt Disney Company) since 1996, Michaels never served as a regular commentator for &quot;ESPN Major League Baseball&quot;. The only time that Michaels appeared in an ESPN booth of any kind was as a guest commentator on &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot; in 2003 as part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Living Legends Series&quot;. Michaels joined Gary Thorne and Joe Morgan, whom he worked with on ABC&#x27;s 1989 World Series coverage and served as ABC&#x27;s #2 baseball team behind Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver in 1989, for a game at Dodger Stadium between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds.

====1987 World Series====

In a February 2015 interview, Michaels alleged that the Minnesota Twins pumped artificial crowd noise into the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Responding to Michaels&#x27; theory, Twins President Dave St. Peter said that he did not think the Twins needed &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in order to win the World Series. Instead, he argued that &quot;appreciation and respect&quot; should be paid to players like Frank Viola, Gary Gaetti, Kent Hrbek, and Kirby Puckett, who, he said, &quot;came out of nowhere to win a championship.&quot;

====1989 World Series====

On October 17, 1989, Michaels was in San Francisco, preparing to cover the third game of the 1989 World Series between the home team, the San Francisco Giants, and the visiting Oakland Athletics. ABC&#x27;s network telecast began with a recap of the first two games (to the soundtrack of James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Hello Old Friend&quot;), both won by Oakland. Soon after Michaels handed off to his broadcast partner, Tim McCarver, who started assessing the Giants&#x27; chances for victory in the game, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck (at approximately 5:04 p.m. local time). While the network feed was breaking up due to the shaking, Michaels exclaimed &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what, we&#x27;re having an earth —&quot;, and at that moment, the feed completely broke up before he could finish his sentence. ABC then put up a green &quot;World Series&quot; telop graphic card on the screen for technical difficulties and restored audio via a telephone link 15 seconds later.  Michaels quipped, &quot;Well folks, that&#x27;s the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!&quot; Michaels then reported from the ABC Sports production truck outside Candlestick Park on the earthquake, for which he later was nominated for an Emmy Award for news broadcasting. Michaels relayed his reports to Ted Koppel, who was stationed at the ABC News bureau in Washington, D.C.

According to Tim McCarver, when the earthquake hit, he, Michaels and Jim Palmer immediately grabbed hold of what they perceived to be the armrests. In reality, the announcers were clutching on each other&#x27;s thighs and they were each left with bruises the next day. Years later (on a 1999 &quot;SportsCenter&quot; retrospective about the 1989 World Series earthquake), Michaels would boldly admit his strong belief that had the earthquake lasted much longer than 15 seconds, he would have been killed. Michaels added that the only time that he really had been scared during the earthquake was when he moved in a position which he perceived to be backward. The three announcers were sitting on a ledge with their backs turned and no bracing behind them.

There was later speculation that if Michaels won an arbitration case involving ABC, he would join CBS Sports as its lead baseball announcer. ABC following the 1989 World Series, had lost its baseball package to CBS for the next four years. Michaels had been feuding with ABC over an alleged violation of company policy. Michaels&#x27; contract with ABC was originally set to expire in late 1992. Ultimately however, ABC announced a contract extension that sources said would keep Michaels at ABC through at least the end of 1995 and would pay him at least $2.2 million annually with the potential to earn more. That would make Michaels the highest-paid sports announcer in television.

====The Baseball Network (1994–1995)====

In 1994, ABC resumed their relationship with Major League Baseball for the first time since 1989 with a broadcasting joint-venture with NBC dubbed The Baseball Network. Michaels was once again paired with Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver, for whom he had broadcast three World Series (1985, 1987, and 1989), two All-Star Games (1986 and 1988), and the 1988 National League Championship Series with. On the subject of Michaels returning to baseball for the first time since the Loma Prieta earthquake interrupted the World Series, Jim Palmer said, &quot;Here Al is, having done five games since 1989, and steps right in. It&#x27;s hard to comprehend how one guy could so amaze.&quot;

A player&#x27;s strike in August 1994 would however, force the cancellation of that season&#x27;s postseason, including the World Series. Then in June 1995, both ABC and NBC announced they would be dissolving The Baseball Network at the end of the 1995 season. The following month, Michaels along with Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver, called the All-Star Game from Arlington, Texas. Come that October, Michaels, Palmer, and McCarver would call Games 1–2 of the National League Division Series between the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers, Game 4 of the NLDS between the Atlanta Braves and Colorado Rockies, Games 1–2 of the National League Championship Series between Atlanta and Cincinnati, and Games 1, 4–5 of the World Series between Atlanta and the Cleveland Indians.

In what would be the final out he would ever call for a baseball broadcast on ABC, Michaels yelled &quot;Back to Georgia!&quot; following the strikeout of Atlanta second baseman Mark Lemke by Cleveland closer José Mesa. ABC was in-line to televise a possible seventh game (since NBC was already scheduled to broadcast Game 6), however the Braves wound up clinching the world title two nights later. Game 5 of the 1995 World Series would not only prove to be the final Major League Baseball game Michaels would call (not counting a one shot appearance on MLB Network for a game between the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets on July 8, 2011), but it would also prove to be the last time a Major League Baseball game would be broadcast on ABC until the 2020 Wild Card series.

Michaels would later write in his 2014 autobiography &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make This Up: Miracles, Memories, and the Perfect Marriage of Sports and Television&quot; that the competition between the two networks could be so juvenile that neither ABC nor NBC wanted to promote each other&#x27;s telecasts during the 1995 World Series. To give you a better idea, in the middle of Game 1, Michaels was handed a promo that read &quot;Join us here on ABC for Game 4 in Cleveland on Wednesday night and for Game 5 if necessary, Thursday.&quot; Michaels however, would soon follow this up by saying &quot;By the way, if you&#x27;re wondering about Games 2 and 3, I can&#x27;t tell you exactly where you can see them, but here&#x27;s a hint: Last night, Bob Costas, Bob Uecker, and Joe Morgan [NBC&#x27;s broadcast crew] were spotted in Underground Atlanta.&quot;

===&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;===

Michaels&#x27;s longest-running assignment was that of the lead play-by-play announcer on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; telecasts, a position he held for 20 seasons beginning in 1986. Before that, his most notable NFL assignment for ABC was hosting (along with Jim Lampley) the pre-game coverage of Super Bowl XIX at the end of the 1984 season. In 1988, he called his first Super Bowl. Three years later, he was on hand to call the thrilling Super Bowl between the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills.

The trio of Michaels, Dan Dierdorf (who joined &quot;MNF&quot; the year after Michaels&#x27;s first), and Frank Gifford lasted until the 1997 season when Gifford was replaced following disclosure of an extramarital affair. During the 1980s, Gifford would fill-in for Michaels on play-by-play whenever he went on baseball assignments for the League Championship Series (1986 and 1988) or World Series (1987 and 1989).

Former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason (who left after the 1999 season) replaced Gifford in 1998, and Dierdorf was dropped after that season. Unexpectedly, comedian Dennis Miller joined the cast in 2000 along with Dan Fouts. In 2002, following Miller and Fouts&#x27; departure, John Madden joined Michaels in a well-received pairing.

===&quot;NBA on ABC&quot;===

After disastrous ratings in the 2003 NBA Finals, ABC decided to revamp their lead NBA broadcast team. Brad Nessler was reassigned to the second broadcast team, where he was joined by Sean Elliott and Dan Majerle. Michaels was hired to replace Nessler as lead broadcaster of the NBA.

For the first several weeks of the 2003–2004 season, he had no partner. However, Doc Rivers, a critically acclaimed analyst when he worked with Turner Sports, became available after a 1–19 start by his Orlando Magic. Rivers was hired weeks before ABC&#x27;s Christmas Day season opener. He and Michaels worked that game together, one of only six they did together during the regular season (all other games Rivers worked were with Brad Nessler). During the playoffs, the team worked every single telecast, including the 2004 NBA Finals, which saw great improvement in television ratings. During the 2004 NBA Playoffs, Doc Rivers was hired by the Boston Celtics. Though Rivers continued to work games with him throughout the rest of the playoffs, ABC would have to find a new lead color commentator for the 2004–2005 season.

Early in the 2004–2005 season, ABC found a new partner for Al Michaels. Memphis Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, a broadcasting legend with CBS, TBS, and TNT, was forced into retirement for health reasons and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers. He and Brown began their partnership on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated Shaquille O&#x27;Neal-Kobe Bryant game. After that game, the two did not do a game together again until March 2005. He became sporadic in NBA coverage, doing two games in early March, and then three more games in April. Brown worked every week of ABC&#x27;s coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster Mike Breen. For the 2005–2006 season, the pair were slated to remain as ABC&#x27;s lead broadcast team. The duo worked that year&#x27;s Christmas Day game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat and was expected to work the NBA Finals together as well. However, due to his impending departure to NBC, that plan did not come to fruition.

Replacing him on &quot;The NBA on ABC&quot; was Mike Breen, who became the lead broadcaster for an over-the-air NBA package for the first time in his career. Breen worked the 2006 NBA Finals with Hubie Brown, as well as all the main games ABC broadcast that year. This gave ABC its first consistent lead broadcaster since Brad Nessler, as Breen (unlike Michaels) did games every week. To put things into proper perspective, during his two-season tenure as ABC&#x27;s lead NBA broadcaster, he called just 13 of a possible 26 regular season games, with all but two games taking place from either Los Angeles (where he resides) or Sacramento.

Besides his inconsistent work, Michaels (despite being initially seen as adding credibility to ABC&#x27;s NBA broadcasts in contrast to his predecessor, Brad Nessler) was criticized for apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire&#x27;s block of Tim Duncan&#x27;s shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a &quot;great, great contested shot&quot;) expected of a No. 1 play-by-play voice. Barry Horn of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; said that Michaels was simply &quot;not a basketball guy&quot;. Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals that Michaels &quot;shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, &#x27;Only five weeks to the [NFL] Hall of Fame Game, I&#x27;m almost there!&#x27;&quot;

Another criticism that he received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he&#x27;s better known). The result was that he would hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about.

==Move from ABC to NBC==
===ABC loses NFL rights===
In 2003, Michaels was quoted as saying, &quot;ABC Sports has been my professional home for the last 26 years, and I am delighted that will continue to be for several more...&quot; after signing a long-term contract extension.

In 2005, it was announced that &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; would be moving from ABC to ESPN beginning with the 2006 season, and partner John Madden announced he would be joining NBC Sports, which had acquired the rights to &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; games. Despite speculation that Michaels might be joining NBC as well, Michaels stated that he would continue as the &quot;MNF&quot; play-by-play announcer, stating, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m a creature of Monday night. I&#x27;m home and I&#x27;m staying home.&quot; Plans were for Michaels to be teamed with Joe Theismann (who would be coming over from &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;) on the Monday night telecasts.

At the time, then-ABC Television President Alex Wallau said, &quot;For 26 years Al has played a pivotal role here at ABC Sports, and for 17 of those years he&#x27;s been the face and voice synonymous with television&#x27;s most successful sports franchise, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;... It&#x27;s Al&#x27;s outstanding play-by-play coverage, coupled with his breadth of knowledge, experience and enthusiasm, that keep &quot;MNF&quot; fans invigorated, excited and coming back for more.&quot; also, &quot;Al Michaels has been invaluable to the Network and we are thrilled to have him remain in our family. [...] Al is the consummate professional and makes everyone around him better&quot; said then-ABC Sports President Howard Katz; however, in the weeks leading up to Super Bowl XL, it was widely speculated that Michaels was attempting to get out of his contract with ESPN to join Madden at NBC. By this time, it was clear that NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; would be the NFL&#x27;s premier prime-time package, with ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; relegated to secondary match-ups similar to that network&#x27;s previous Sunday night telecasts. Michaels added fuel to the fire by refusing to state his future plans, and he couldn&#x27;t &quot;respond to rumors ... because that would become a distraction.&quot;

On February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that its &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; team would consist of Mike Tirico on play-by-play, with Theismann and Tony Kornheiser as analysts. ESPN explicitly stated that Michaels would not return to either &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts or ABC&#x27;s NBA broadcasts (on which Michaels had been lead NBA play-by-play man).

===Oswald the Lucky Rabbit &quot;trade&quot;===
On February 9, 2006, NBC confirmed that Michaels would be joining Madden at NBC to broadcast the NFL on Sunday nights, thus ending Michaels&#x27;s 20-year run on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and almost 30 years of service with ABC. In exchange for letting Michaels out of his contract with ABC and ESPN, NBCUniversal sold ESPN cable rights to Friday coverage of the next four Ryder Cups, granted ESPN increased usage of Olympic highlights, and sold to parent company Disney the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a cartoon character developed by Walt Disney himself (which he lost in 1928) but previously owned by Universal Pictures (now NBCUniversal). NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol explained, &quot;We earn nothing from those rights; they&#x27;ve had no value in the United States.&quot;

Michaels had a bemused take on the &quot;trade&quot;. After it was noted to Michaels that the Kansas City Chiefs gave the New York Jets a draft pick as compensation for releasing coach Herman Edwards from his contract, Michaels stated, &quot;Oswald is definitely worth more than a fourth-round draft choice. I&#x27;m going to be a trivia answer someday.&quot; In an article with the magazine &quot;Game Informer&quot;, Warren Spector, a designer on the game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;, stated that Disney CEO Bob Iger wanted Oswald to be in the game so badly, he made this trade to get the rights of the character back.

==NBC Sports (2006–present)==
===&quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;===

Michaels and Madden began their new NBC tenure on August 6, 2006, with NBC&#x27;s telecast of the preseason Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, with their regular-season debut on September 7. Michaels called &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; with John Madden from August 6, 2006 – April 15, 2009. On April 16, 2009, Cris Collinsworth made an agreement with NBC to join Michaels, replacing Madden for &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. On February 1, 2009, Michaels called Super Bowl XLIII, his first Super Bowl telecast for NBC and seventh overall as a play-by-play announcer. Michaels is the third man to ever do play-by-play for an NBC broadcast of a Super Bowl, following the footsteps of Curt Gowdy and Dick Enberg. Michaels also called Super Bowl XLVI on February 5, 2012, Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015, Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, and Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, and in doing so, he tied Pat Summerall for the most Super Bowls called by a play-by-play announcer, though Summerall still holds the record for the most Super Bowls announced at 16, having also worked Super Bowl I as a sideline reporter and Super Bowls II, IV, VI, and VIII as a color commentator.

Michaels usually ate his dinner while doing play-by-play commentary during a typical broadcast of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. Michaels would have cookies and grapes during the first half and a light dinner during the second half, having his bites during commercial breaks.

On May 24, 2022, NBC announced that despite his official departure from &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; following the 2021 season, Michaels would still call at least one NFL playoff game for NBC under an &quot;emeritus&quot; role, though in December 2023 it was reported that he was cut from postseason coverage on NBC beginning with the 2023–24 NFL playoffs.

===NBC Olympic Daytime host===
In March 2009, it was announced that Michaels would be serving as the daytime host for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was Michaels&#x27;s first involvement in an Olympic telecast since he called ice hockey at the 1988 Calgary Games for ABC, as well as his first non-NFL event for NBC. NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said that Michaels had previously expressed an interest in contributing to NBC&#x27;s Olympics coverage. Michaels also co-hosted NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Closing Ceremony (with Bob Costas). Michaels also served as daytime co-host (with Dan Patrick) for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and co-hosted the Closing Ceremony (with Costas and Ryan Seacrest). For the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Michaels served as weekday host on NBCSN and weekend daytime host on NBC. He returned to host daytime coverage for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

According to Michaels, ABC was in the running to purchase the broadcasting rights for the 1996 Summer Games from Atlanta. As a provision in his contract renewal with ABC back in 1992, in the event that ABC were to broadcast the Olympics again, Michaels would get to become the prime time anchor while Jim McKay would instead play an emeritus role. Ultimately though, NBC bought the rights to the Atlanta Games for $456 million, edging out ABC by $6 million.

===Premier Boxing Champions===

In January 2015, NBC announced that Michaels would be at ringside along with Marv Albert and Sugar Ray Leonard for the &quot;PBC on NBC&quot; Saturday night bouts. In partnership with Haymon Boxing, NBC would televise 20 &quot;PBC on NBC&quot; events, including five shown in prime time on Saturday nights.

==MLB Network (2011)==
On July 8, 2011, Michaels teamed up with Bob Costas (with the two announcers alternating between play-by-play and color commentary) to call a game between the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants on MLB Network. It was Michaels&#x27;s first appearance on a baseball telecast since August 6, 2003 (when he served as a guest commentator on an ESPN game, as previously mentioned) and his first as a primary announcer since Game 5 of the 1995 World Series on ABC. (Michaels had called Games 1, 4 and 5 of that series with Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver, while Costas called Games 2, 3 and 6 with Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker for NBC.) Michaels and Costas also made appearances on SportsNet New York and Comcast SportsNet Bay Area during the game&#x27;s middle innings, since the MLB Network broadcast was blacked out in the Mets&#x27; and Giants&#x27; respective home markets.

==&quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; (2016, 2022–present)==
Michaels first called &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; in 2016, as part of a deal which would see NBC produce several Thursday night games for broadcast on NFL Network with simulcasts on selected games on NBC. The following year, NBC confirmed that Mike Tirico would take over as the voice of NBC-produced Thursday night games.

On March 23, 2022, the NFL and Amazon announced that Michaels would become the full-time play-by-play announcer for &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;, alongside Kirk Herbstreit, for the first year of the package airing exclusively on Amazon Prime Video and Twitch.

Throughout his tenure as the play-by-play announcer for Amazon Prime, viewers have repeatedly criticized Michaels for a perceived lack of enthusiasm during games. When asked about his experience calling Thursday night games, Michaels hinted at the suboptimal quality of the games and said, &quot;I mean, you just can&#x27;t oversell something. Do you want me to sell you a 20-year-old Mazda? That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re asking me to do. I can&#x27;t sell you a used car.&quot;

In 2014, Michaels released his autobiography titled &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make This Up: Memories and the Perfect Marriage of Sports and Television&quot;, which reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for nonfiction.

Michaels had an acting role in a 1970 episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, and has appeared as himself in the films &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and &quot;BASEketball&quot;, as well as on several TV shows including &quot;Coach&quot; and &quot;Spin City&quot;. His call of the U.S. hockey team&#x27;s victory in the 1980 Olympics can be heard in the 2004 film &quot;Miracle&quot;. Michaels re-recorded all his original play-by-play coverage for the film, except for the memorable line.

Brian d&#x27;Arcy James portrayed Michaels in the 2002 television movie &quot;Monday Night Mayhem&quot;. Michaels has also been lampooned on several occasions by noted impressionists, Frank Caliendo and Billy West as well as in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Mother Tucker&quot;.

Michaels was also the featured voice in &quot;HardBall III&quot;, a popular computer baseball game for PC. He was also featured, along with John Madden, in the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series from &quot;Madden NFL 2003&quot; to &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot;.

<text>The brown-capped rosy finch (Leucosticte australis) is a medium-sized finch endemic to North America.

Adults are brown on the head, back, and breast. The belly and rump are pink, with additional pink shading on the wings and tail. The pink is pronounced on the male but more subdued on the female. The forehead is black or grayish brown. The bill is yellow in winter and black in summer. These birds have short black legs and a long forked tail.

Their breeding habitat is mountain peaks in the central Rocky Mountains of the United States. They build a cup nest in a cavity on a cliff, or re-use abandoned cliff swallow nests. In winter, these birds migrate short distances to lower elevations.

These birds can be found in alpine snowfields and also at feeders, especially in the winter. They forage on the ground, but may fly to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat seeds from weeds and grasses and insects. They often feed in small flocks with other rosy finches.

At one time, the three North American rosy finches were considered to be one species.

Despite fears that the population of this bird is declining, an analysis published in 2023 found a healthy population with more than three times the birds estimated in a 2016 report.

<text>Ray Solomonoff (July 25, 1926 – December 7, 2009) was an American mathematician who invented algorithmic probability, his General Theory of Inductive Inference (also known as Universal Inductive Inference), and was a founder of algorithmic information theory. He was an originator of the branch of artificial intelligence based on machine learning, prediction and probability. He circulated the first report on non-semantic machine learning in 1956.

Solomonoff first described algorithmic probability in 1960, publishing the theorem that launched Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory. He first described these results at a conference at Caltech in 1960, and in a report, Feb. 1960, &quot;A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference.&quot; He clarified these ideas more fully in his 1964 publications, &quot;A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference,&quot; Part I and Part II.

Algorithmic probability is a mathematically formalized combination of Occam&#x27;s razor, and the Principle of Multiple Explanations.
It is a machine independent method of assigning a probability value to each hypothesis (algorithm/program) that explains a given observation, with the simplest hypothesis (the shortest program) having the highest probability and the increasingly complex hypotheses receiving increasingly small probabilities.

Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference, which is based on solid philosophical foundations and has its root in Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory. The theory uses algorithmic probability in a Bayesian framework. The universal prior is taken over the class of all computable measures; no hypothesis will have a zero probability. This enables Bayes&#x27; rule (of causation) to be used to predict the most likely next event in a series of events, and how likely it will be.

Although he is best known for algorithmic probability and his general theory of inductive inference, he made many other important discoveries throughout his life, most of them directed toward his goal in artificial intelligence: to develop a machine that could solve hard problems using probabilistic methods.

== Life history through 1964 ==

Ray Solomonoff was born on July 25, 1926, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Jewish Russian immigrants Phillip Julius and Sarah Mashman Solomonoff. He attended Glenville High School, graduating in 1944. In 1944 he joined the United States Navy as Instructor in Electronics. From 1947–1951 he attended the University of Chicago, studying under Professors such as Rudolf Carnap and Enrico Fermi, and graduated with an M.S. in Physics in 1951.

From his earliest years he was motivated by the pure joy of mathematical discovery and by the desire to explore where no one had gone before. At the age of 16, in 1942, he began to search for a general method to solve mathematical problems.

In 1952 he met Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and others interested in machine intelligence. In 1956 Minsky and McCarthy and others organized the Dartmouth Summer Research Conference on Artificial Intelligence, where Solomonoff was one of the original 10 invitees—he, McCarthy, and Minsky were the only ones to stay all summer. It was for this group that Artificial Intelligence was first named as a science. Computers at the time could solve very specific mathematical problems, but not much else. Solomonoff wanted to pursue a bigger question, how to make machines more generally intelligent, and how computers could use probability for this purpose.

== Work history through 1964 ==

He wrote three papers, two with Anatol Rapoport, in 1950–52, that are regarded as the earliest statistical analysis of networks.

He was one of the 10 attendees at the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. He wrote and circulated a report among the attendees: &quot;An Inductive Inference Machine&quot;. It viewed machine learning as probabilistic, with an emphasis on the importance of training sequences, and on the use of parts of previous solutions to problems in constructing trial solutions for new problems. He published a version of his findings in 1957. These were the first papers to be written on probabilistic machine learning.

In the late 1950s, he invented probabilistic languages and their associated grammars. A probabilistic language assigns a probability value to every possible string. 
Generalizing the concept of probabilistic grammars led him to his discovery in 1960 of Algorithmic Probability and General Theory of Inductive Inference.

Prior to the 1960s, the usual method of calculating probability was based on frequency: taking the ratio of favorable results to the total number of trials. In his 1960 publication, and, more completely, in his 1964 publications, Solomonoff seriously revised this definition of probability. He called this new form of probability &quot;Algorithmic Probability&quot; and showed how to use it for prediction in his theory of inductive inference. As part of this work, he produced the philosophical foundation for the use of Bayes rule of causation for prediction.

The basic theorem of what was later called Kolmogorov Complexity was part of his General Theory. Writing in 1960, he begins: &quot;Consider a very long sequence of symbols ... We shall consider such a sequence of symbols to be &#x27;simple&#x27; and have a high a priori probability, if there exists a very brief description of this sequence – using, of course, some sort of stipulated description method. More exactly, if we use only the symbols 0 and 1 to express our description, we will assign the probability 2−&quot;N&quot; to a sequence of symbols if its shortest possible binary description contains &quot;N&quot; digits.&quot;

The probability is with reference to a particular universal Turing machine. Solomonoff showed and in 1964 proved that the choice of machine, while it could add a constant factor would not change the probability ratios very much. These probabilities are machine independent.

In 1965, the Russian mathematician Kolmogorov independently published similar ideas. When he became aware of Solomonoff&#x27;s work, he acknowledged Solomonoff, and for several years, Solomonoff&#x27;s work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was more concerned with randomness of a sequence. Algorithmic Probability and Universal (Solomonoff) Induction became associated with Solomonoff, who was focused on prediction — the extrapolation of a sequence.

Later in the same 1960 publication Solomonoff describes his extension of the single-shortest-code theory. This is Algorithmic
Probability. He states: &quot;It would seem that if there are several different methods of describing a sequence, each of these methods should be given &quot;some&quot; weight in determining the probability of that sequence.&quot; He then shows how this idea can be used to generate the universal a priori probability distribution and how it enables the use of Bayes rule in inductive inference. Inductive inference, by adding up the predictions of all models describing a particular sequence, using suitable weights based on the lengths of those models, gets the probability distribution for the extension of that sequence. This method of prediction has since become known as Solomonoff induction.

He enlarged his theory, publishing a number of reports leading up to the publications in 1964. The 1964 papers give a more detailed description of Algorithmic Probability, and Solomonoff Induction, presenting five different models, including the model popularly called the Universal Distribution.

== Work history from 1964 to 1984 ==

Other scientists who had been at the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Conference (such as Newell and Simon) were developing the branch of Artificial Intelligence that used machines governed by if-then rules, fact based. Solomonoff was developing the branch of Artificial Intelligence that focussed on probability and prediction; his specific view of A.I. described machines that were governed by the Algorithmic Probability distribution. The machine generates theories together with their associated probabilities, to solve problems, and as new problems and theories develop, updates the probability distribution on the theories.

In 1968 he found a proof for the
efficacy of Algorithmic Probability, but mainly because of lack of general interest at that time, did not publish it until 10 years later. In his report, he published the proof for the convergence theorem.

In the years following his discovery of Algorithmic Probability he focused on how to use this probability and Solomonoff Induction in actual prediction and problem solving for A.I. He also wanted to understand the deeper implications of this probability system.

One important aspect of Algorithmic Probability is that it is complete and incomputable.

In the 1968 report he shows that Algorithmic Probability is &quot;complete&quot;; that is, if there is any describable regularity in a body of data, Algorithmic Probability will eventually discover that regularity, requiring a relatively small sample of that data. Algorithmic Probability is the only probability system known to be complete in this way. As a necessary consequence of its completeness it is &quot;incomputable&quot;. The incomputability is because some algorithms—a subset of those that are partially recursive—can never be evaluated fully because it would take too long. But these programs will at least be recognized as possible solutions. On the other hand, any &quot;computable&quot; system is &quot;incomplete&quot;. There will always be descriptions outside that system&#x27;s search space, which will never be acknowledged or considered, even in an infinite amount of time. Computable prediction models hide this fact by ignoring such algorithms.

In many of his papers he described how to search for solutions to problems and in the 1970s and early 1980s developed what he felt was the best way to update the machine.

The use of probability in A.I., however, did not have a completely smooth path. In the early years of A.I., the relevance of probability was problematic. Many in the A.I. community felt probability was not usable in their work. The area of pattern recognition did use a form of probability, but because there was no broadly based theory of how to incorporate probability in any A.I. field, most fields did not use it at all.

There were, however, researchers such as Pearl and Peter Cheeseman who argued that probability could be used in artificial intelligence.

About 1984, at an annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), it was decided that probability was in no way relevant to A.I.

A protest group formed, and the next year there was a workshop at the AAAI meeting devoted to &quot;Probability and Uncertainty in AI.&quot; This yearly workshop has continued to the present day.

As part of the protest at the first workshop, Solomonoff gave a paper on how to apply the universal distribution to problems in A.I. This was an early version of the system he has been developing since that time.

In that report, he described the search technique he had developed. In search problems, the best order of search, is time formula_1, where formula_2 is the time needed to test the trial and formula_3 is the probability of success of that trial. He called this the &quot;Conceptual Jump Size&quot; of the problem. Levin&#x27;s search technique approximates this order, and so Solomonoff, who had studied Levin&#x27;s work, called this search technique Lsearch.

== Work history — the later years ==
In other papers he explored how to limit the time needed to search for solutions, writing on resource bounded search. The search space is limited by available time or computation cost rather than by cutting out search space as is done in some other prediction methods, such as Minimum Description Length.

Throughout his career Solomonoff was concerned with the potential benefits and dangers of A.I., discussing it in many of his published reports. In 1985 he analyzed a likely evolution of A.I., giving a formula predicting when it would reach the &quot;Infinity Point&quot;. This work is part of the history of thought about a possible technological singularity.

Originally algorithmic induction methods extrapolated ordered sequences of strings. Methods were needed for dealing with other kinds of data.

A 1999 report, generalizes the Universal Distribution and associated convergence theorems to unordered sets of strings and a 2008 report, to unordered pairs of strings.

In 1997, 2003 and 2006 he showed that incomputability and subjectivity are both necessary and desirable characteristics of any high performance induction system.

In 1970 he formed his own one man company, Oxbridge Research, and continued his research there except for periods at other
institutions such as MIT, University of Saarland in Germany and the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Lugano, Switzerland. In 2003 he was the first recipient of the Kolmogorov Award by The Computer Learning Research Center at the Royal Holloway, University of London, where he gave the inaugural Kolmogorov Lecture. Solomonoff was most recently a visiting professor at the CLRC.

In 2006 he spoke at AI@50, &quot;Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: the Next Fifty Years&quot; commemorating the fiftieth anniversary
of the original Dartmouth summer study group. Solomonoff was one of five original participants to attend.

In Feb. 2008, he gave the keynote address at the Conference &quot;Current Trends in the Theory and Application of Computer Science&quot; (CTTACS), held at Notre Dame University in Lebanon. He followed this with a short series of lectures, and began research on new applications of Algorithmic Probability.

Algorithmic Probability and Solomonoff Induction have many advantages for Artificial Intelligence. Algorithmic Probability gives extremely accurate probability estimates. These estimates can be revised by a reliable method so that they continue to be acceptable. It utilizes search time in a very efficient way. In addition to probability estimates, Algorithmic Probability &quot;has for AI another important value: its multiplicity of models gives us many different ways to understand our data;

A description of Solomonoff&#x27;s life and work prior to 1997 is in &quot;The Discovery of Algorithmic Probability&quot;, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Vol 55, No. 1, pp 73–88, August 1997. The paper, as well as most of the others mentioned here, are available on his website at the publications page.

In an article published the year of his death, a journal article said of Solomonoff: &quot;A very conventional scientist understands his science using a single &#x27;current paradigm&#x27;—the way of understanding that is most in vogue at the present time. A more creative scientist understands his science in very many ways, and can more easily create new theories, new ways of understanding, when the &#x27;current paradigm&#x27; no longer fits the current data&quot;.

<doc id="402674" wikidata="Q1352119" url="?curid=402674" title="Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources">
<text>The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, also known as the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, andCCAMLR, is part of the Antarctic Treaty System.

The convention was opened for signature on 1 August 1980 and entered into force on 7 April 1982 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, headquartered in Tasmania, Australia. The goal is to preserve marine life and environmental integrity in and near Antarctica.

It was established in large part to concerns that an increase in krill catches in the Southern Ocean could have a serious impact on populations of other marine life which are dependent upon krill for food.

In 1989, CCAMLR set up the Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) to further monitor the effects of fishing and harvesting of species in the area.

On 19 October 2022, Ecuador became a New Member of the Commission, the 26th member of the CCAMLR.

== Member states ==

== Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) ==
In 2009, the Commission agreed by consensus to creating a representative network of MPAs by 2012. It was the first international body to do this based on recommendations from the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development. In 2011, it identified nine planning domains within which to designate these protected areas.
=== South Orkneys MPA ===
In 2009, the Commission agreed by consensus to establish the world&#x27;s first high-seas MPA to protect ocean surrounding the South Orkney Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean.

It was proposed by the United Kingdom and covers 94,000 km2. It came into force in May 2010.

=== Ross Sea MPA ===
In 2010, a proposal for an MPA in the Ross Sea were put forward by both the US and New Zealand. These were later combined as a joint proposal.

In July 2013, the Commission held a special meeting in Bremerhaven to consider proposals for MPAs in both the Ross Sea and East Antarctica. Consensus was not reached after Russia voted against the proposals, citing uncertainty about whether the commission had the authority to establish a protected area.

On 28 October 2016, after several years of scientific and diplomatic discussions, the Commission agreed by consensus to designate the Ross Sea marine protected area at its annual meeting in Hobart. The protected area covers 1.55 million square kilometres of ocean, of which 72% is a no-take zone. The remaining 28% include some harvesting of fish and krill for the purpose of scientific research.

The Ross Sea MPA will be in force for 35 years. At the end of its review period in 2052, CCAMLR Members must agree by consensus to renew or modify it as needed.

=== East Antarctic MPA ===
In 2010, Australia, France and the European Union submitted a proposal for an MPA in East Antarctica. It originally included seven representative areas with varying degrees of protection and covered 1.8 million square kilometres of ocean. By 2017, these were scaled back to three areas covering just under 1 million square kilometres. This was due to the political concerns and economic interests expressed by some Member states. The proposal was also amended to include an expiration of 30 years after designation and the ability to review its monitoring and management every ten years. It has been under consideration by the Commission since 2012.

In 1818, Gmelin was one of the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color in a flame.

In 1826, Jean-Baptiste Guimet was credited with having devised a process for the artificial manufacture of ultramarine. Two years later, in 1828, Gmelin published his own process for the artificial manufacture of ultramarine. Since Gmelin was the first to publish this process, he received the recognition for this discovery. In his publication, Gmelin stated that silica, alumina, and soda are the main constituents of ultramarine and the rich color comes from sulfur.

==Death==

Gmelin died in Tübingen, Germany, where he spent his entire life, on May 13, 1860.

<text>The subtropical zones or subtropics are geographical and climate zones immediately to the north and south of the tropics. Geographically part of the temperate zones of both hemispheres, they cover the middle latitudes from to approximately 35° to 40° north and south. The horse latitudes lie within this range.

Subtropical climates are often characterized by hot summers and mild winters with infrequent frost. Most subtropical climates fall into two basic types: humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa), where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months, for example Southeast China and the Southeastern United States, and dry summer or Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa/Csb), where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months, such as the Mediterranean Basin or Southern California.

Subtropical climates can also occur at high elevations within the tropics, such as in the southern end of the Mexican Plateau and in Da Lat of the Vietnamese Central Highlands. The six climate classifications use the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for planet Earth.

A great portion of the world&#x27;s deserts are within the subtropics, as this is where the semi-permanent subtropical anticyclone resides (typically inland on the southwest sides of continents). Areas bordering warm oceans (typically on the southeast sides of continents) have hot and wet summers with frequent (but brief) convective rainfall (tropical cyclones can also contribute to annual rainfall). Areas bordering cool oceans (typically on the southwest sides of continents) are prone to fog, aridity, and dry summers. Plants such as palms, citrus, mango, pistachio, lychee, and avocado are grown in the subtropics.

== Definition ==
The tropics have been &quot;historically&quot; defined as lying between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, at latitudes north and south, respectively. According to the American Meteorological Society, the poleward fringe of the subtropics is at latitudes approximately 35° north and south, respectively.

Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate depending on the climate system used.

The most well known is the Trewartha climate classification, which defines a subtropical region as one that has at least eight months with a mean temperature greater than and at least one month with a mean temperature under .

German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined &quot;warm temperate zones&quot; as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between and in the Northern Hemisphere and between and in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone, which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.

According to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: &quot;rainy winters of the west sides&quot; and &quot;eastern subtropical climate&quot;. According to the Wilhelm Lauer &amp; Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: &quot;high-continental&quot;, &quot;continental&quot;, and &quot;maritime&quot;. According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.

Leslie Holdridge defined the subtropical climates as having a mean annual biotemperature between the frost line or critical temperature line, 16 °C to 18 °C (depending on locations in the world), and 24 °C. The frost line separates the warm temperate region from the subtropical region. It represents the dividing line between two major physiological groups of evolved plants. Most of the plants are sensitive to low temperatures on the warmer side of the line. They can be killed back by frosts as they have not evolved to withstand periods of cold. On the colder temperate side of the line, the total flora is adapted to survive periods of variable lengths of low temperatures, whether as seeds in the case of the annuals or as perennial plants that can withstand the cold. The 16 °C–18 °C segment is often &quot;simplified&quot; as 17 °C formula_1.

The Holdridge subtropical climates straddle more or less the warmest subtropical climates and the less warm tropical climates as defined by the Köppen-Geiger or Trewartha climate classifications.

However Wladimir Köppen has distinguished the hot or subtropical and tropical (semi-)arid climates (&quot;BWh&quot; or &quot;BSh&quot;) having an average annual temperature greater than or equal to from the cold or temperate (semi-)arid climates (&quot;BWk&quot; or &quot;BSk&quot;) whose annual temperature average is lower. This definition, though restricted to dry regions, is almost similar to Holdridge&#x27;s.

== Rainfall ==
Heating of the earth by the sun near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection winds along the monsoon trough or Intertropical Convergence Zone. The upper-level divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As the air moves towards the mid-latitudes, it cools, gets denser and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge. Many of the world&#x27;s deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas, within the subtropics. This regime is known as a semiarid/arid subtropical climate, which is generally in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents. Examples of this climate are the coastal areas of Southern Africa and the west coast of South America.

The humid subtropical climate is often on the western side of the subtropical high. Here, unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours, and summer is normally the season of peak annual rainfall. In the winter (dry season) the monsoon retreats, and the drier trade winds bring more stable airmass and often dry weather, and frequent sunny skies. Areas that have this type of subtropical climate include Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of South America. In areas bounded by warm ocean like the southeastern United States and East Asia, tropical cyclones can contribute significantly to local rainfall within the subtropics. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons.

The Mediterranean climate is a subtropical climate, usually found on the western side of continents, with a wet season in winter and a dry season in the summer. Regions with this type of climate include the rim lands of the Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Australia, parts of the west coast of South America around Santiago and the coastal areas of the lower west coast of the United States.

== Flora ==

These climates do not routinely see hard freezes or snow due to winter on average being above freezing, which allows plants such as palms and citrus to flourish. As one moves toward the tropical side the slight winter cool season disappears, while at the poleward threshold of the subtropics the winters become cooler. Some crops which have been traditionally farmed in tropical climates, such as mango, litchi, avocado and aloe vera, are also cultivated in the subtropics. Pest control of the crops is easier than in the tropics, due to the cooler winters.

Tree ferns (pteridophytes) are grown in subtropical areas, as are dracaena and yucca, and trees in the Taxaceae. Apple, pear and pomegranate also grow well in the subtropics.
==Varieties==

===Humid subtropical climate===

The humid subtropical climate is a subtropical climate type characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. This climate can be found in northern Middle East, northern South Asia, Northern Vietnam, eastern Australia, southern and southeastern China, southern Japan, the deep southeastern United States, southeastern South America, southeastern Southern Africa, northcentral Southern Europe, and southern and southwestern Eastern Europe. 

In most humid subtropical climates, summer is the wettest season. In summer, the subtropical high pressure cells provide a sultry southernly flow of tropical air with high dew points, and frequent (but brief) convective showers are common. With decreasing latitude most humid subtropical climates typically have drier winters and wetter summers, however some sectors with this climate see a more even rhythm of seasonal rainfall. Tropical lows and weakening tropical storms often contribute to seasonal rainfall in most humid subtropical climates. In the cool season (winter) the subtropical highs retreat, and the humid subtropics are more influenced by the westerlies and the fronts and storms that move with them.



===Subtropical highland climate===

The Subtropical highland climate is a climate variant often grouped together with oceanic climates found in some mountainous areas of either the subtropics or tropics. It has characteristically mild temperatures year-round, featuring the four seasons in the subtropics and no marked seasons in the tropics, the latter usually remaining mild to cool through most of the year. Subtropical highland climates under the Cfb classification usually have rainfall spread relatively evenly in all months of the year similar to most oceanic climates while climates under the Cwb classification have significant monsoon influence, usually having dry winters and wet summers.


===Mediterranean climate===
The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of lower West Coast of the United States, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cooler winters with rainfall. In Europe, the northernmost mediterranean climates are found along the Italian Riviera, at 44° latitude. Parts of southwestern Australia around Perth have a Mediterranean climate as do areas around coastal South Africa.


===Semi-desert/desert climate===

According to Köppen, arid subtropical climates are characterized by an annual average temperature above , the absence of regular rainfall, and high humidity.

<doc id="402681" wikidata="Q3261783" url="?curid=402681" title="Aluminum can">
<text>An aluminum can (British English: aluminium can) is a single-use container for packaging made primarily of an aluminum exterior with an epoxy resin or polymer coated interior.
It is commonly used for food and beverages such as olives and soup but also for products such as oil, chemicals, and other liquids. Global production is 180 billion annually and constitutes the largest single use of aluminum globally.

==Usage==

Use of aluminum in cans began in 1957. Aluminum offers greater malleability, resulting in ease of manufacture; this gave rise to the two-piece can, where all but the top of the can is simply stamped out of a single piece of aluminum, rather than constructed from two pieces of steel. The inside of the can is lined by spray coating an epoxy lacquer or polymer to protect the aluminum from being corroded by acidic contents such as carbonated beverages and imparting a metallic taste to the beverage. The epoxy may contain bisphenol A. A label is either printed directly on the side of the can or will be glued to the outside of the curved surface, indicating its contents.

Most aluminum cans are made of two pieces. The bottom and body are &quot;drawn&quot; or &quot;drawn and ironed&quot; from a flat plate or shallow cup. After filling, the can &quot;end&quot; is sealed onto the top of the can. This is supplemented by a sealing compound to ensure that the top is air tight.

The advantages of aluminum over steel (tinplate) cans include;
* light weight
* competitive cost
* usage of easy-open aluminum ends: no need for a can opener
* clean appearance
* aluminum does not rust
* easy to press into shape
The easy-open aluminum end for beverage cans was developed by Alcoa in 1962 for the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and is now used in nearly all of the canned beer market.

==Recycling==

Aluminum cans can be made with recycled aluminum. In 2017, 3.8 million tons of aluminum were generated in the US of which 0.62 million tons were recycled - a recycling rate of 16%. According to estimates from the Aluminum Association, a large amount of aluminium remains unrecycled in the US, where roughly $700 million worth of cans end up in landfills each year. In 2012, 92% of the aluminum beverage cans sold in Switzerland were recycled. Cans are the most recycled beverage container, at a rate of 69% worldwide.

One issue is that the top of the can is made from a blend of aluminum and magnesium to increase its strength. When the can is melted for recycling, the mixture is unsuitable for either the top or the bottom/side. Instead of mixing recycled metal with more aluminum (to soften it) or magnesium (to harden it), a new approach uses annealing to produce an alloy that works for both.

The aluminum can is also considered the most valuable recyclable material in an average recycling bin. It is estimated that Americans throw away nearly 1 billion dollars a year in wasted aluminum. The aluminum industry pays nearly 800 million dollars a year for recycled aluminum since it is so versatile.

Because of the advantages of aluminium packaging (shelf life, durability, food grade factor) over plastics, it is considered an alternative to PET bottles, with the possibility of replacing the majority of them in the next decades.

== Cans as collectibles ==
Some people collect cans as a hobby. Can collections can be exclusive to one sector only, eg., some collectors may collect soda cans only, while others may dedicate themselves to collecting beer cans or oil cans exclusively, but some collectors may collect cans regardless of the type of can. 

One aspect that may make someone interested in building a can collection as a hobby is the variety of cans available worldwide promoting such things as films, musical albums and tours, sporting teams and events, countries, ideals and even some non-food or petrol-oriented brands and companies.

Celebrities can also be featured on collectible cans; such was the case of tennis player Andre Agassi, who had a set of four Pepsi Max soda cans dedicated to him in 1996.

Davide Andreani of Italy is in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the largest collection of soda cans of one specific brand in the world, with over 20,000 cans in his collection. According to a website named canmuseum.com, the largest collection of Pepsi Cola cans belongs to Chris Cavaletti, also of Italy, who owned 12,402 Pepsi Cola cans from 81 countries as of 2022, while the largest collection of Coca-Cola soda cans belonged to Gary Feng of Canada with 11,308 variations of the Coca-Cola cans from 108 countries collected, with William B. Christensen of the United States owning the largest collection of beer cans with 75,000 from 125 countries and Allan Green, of the United States also, with the largest collection of wine cans, at 449.

Some webpages are dedicated to the hobby of can collecting.

<text>Johann Friedrich Gmelin (8 August 1748 – 1 November 1804) was a German naturalist, chemist, botanist, entomologist, herpetologist, and malacologist.

== Education ==
Johann Friedrich Gmelin was born as the eldest son of Philipp Friedrich Gmelin in 1748 in Tübingen. He studied medicine under his father at University of Tübingen and graduated with a Master&#x27;s degree in 1768, with a thesis entitled: &#x27;, defended under the presidency of Ferdinand Christoph Oetinger, whom he thanks with the words &#x27;.

== Career ==

In 1769, Gmelin became an adjunct professor of medicine at University of Tübingen. In 1773, he became professor of philosophy and adjunct professor of medicine at University of Göttingen. He was promoted to full professor of medicine and professor of chemistry, botany, and mineralogy in 1778. He died in 1804 in Göttingen and is buried there in the Albani cemetery with his wife Rosine Louise Gmelin (1755–1828, née Schott).

Johann Friedrich Gmelin when young became a respected colleague of Carl Linnaeus, probably when Linnaeus was visiting the Netherlands or northern Germany around 1770, and collected plants &quot;Persia&quot; on his behalf. Later in life he published several textbooks in the fields of chemistry, pharmaceutical science, mineralogy, and botany. He also edited and published the posthumous 13th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Carl Linnaeus from 1788 to 1793. This contained descriptions and scientific names of many new species, including birds that had earlier been catalogued without a scientific name by John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Gmelin&#x27;s publication is cited as the authority for over 290 bird species and also a number of butterfly species.

== Legacy ==
Among his students were Georg Friedrich Hildebrandt, Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer, Friedrich Stromeyer, and Wilhelm August Lampadius. He was the father of Leopold Gmelin.

He described the redfin pickerel in 1789. In the scientific field of herpetology, he described many new species of amphibians and reptiles. In the field of malacology, he described and named many species of gastropods.

The plant genus &quot;Gmelina&quot; was named after J.F. Gmelin (or possibly J.G. Gmelin, or both) by Linnaeus.

 The abbreviation &quot;Gmel.&quot; is also found.

<doc id="402688" wikidata="Q4724365" url="?curid=402688" title="Algorithmic probability">
<text>In algorithmic information theory, algorithmic probability, also known as Solomonoff probability, is a mathematical method of assigning a prior probability to a given observation. It was invented by Ray Solomonoff in the 1960s. 
It is used in inductive inference theory and analyses of algorithms. In his general theory of inductive inference, Solomonoff uses the method together with Bayes&#x27; rule to obtain probabilities of prediction for an algorithm&#x27;s future outputs.

In the mathematical formalism used, the observations have the form of finite binary strings viewed as outputs of Turing machines, and the universal prior is a probability distribution over the set of finite binary strings calculated from a probability distribution over programs (that is, inputs to a universal Turing machine). The prior is universal in the
Turing-computability sense, i.e. no string has zero probability. It is not computable, but it can be approximated.

Formally, the probability formula_1 is not a probability and it is not computable. It is only &quot;lower semi-computable&quot; and a &quot;semi-measure&quot;. By &quot;semi-measure&quot;, it means that formula_2. That is, the &quot;probability&quot; does not actually sum up to one, unlike actual probabilities. This is because some inputs to the Turing machine causes it to never halt, which means the probability mass allocated to those inputs is lost. By &quot;lower semi-computable&quot;, it means there is a Turing machine that, given an input string formula_3, can print out a sequence formula_4 that converges to formula_5 from below, but there is no such Turing machine that does the same from above.

==Overview==

Algorithmic probability is the main ingredient of Solomonoff&#x27;s theory of inductive inference, the theory of prediction based on observations; it was invented with the goal of using it for machine learning; given a sequence of symbols, which one will come next? Solomonoff&#x27;s theory provides an answer that is optimal in a certain sense, although it is incomputable. Unlike, for example, Karl Popper&#x27;s informal inductive inference theory, Solomonoff&#x27;s is mathematically rigorous.

Four principal inspirations for Solomonoff&#x27;s algorithmic probability were: Occam&#x27;s razor, Epicurus&#x27; principle of multiple explanations, modern computing theory (e.g. use of a universal Turing machine) and Bayes’ rule for prediction.

Occam&#x27;s razor and Epicurus&#x27; principle are essentially two different non-mathematical approximations of the universal prior.

* Occam&#x27;s razor: &quot;among the theories that are consistent with the observed phenomena, one should select the simplest theory&quot;.
* Epicurus&#x27; principle of multiple explanations: &quot;if more than one theory is consistent with the observations, keep all such theories&quot;.

At the heart of the universal prior is an abstract model of a computer, such as a universal Turing machine. Any abstract computer will do, as long as it is Turing-complete, i.e. every computable function has at least one program that will compute its application on the abstract computer.

The abstract computer is used to give precise meaning to the phrase &quot;simple explanation&quot;. In the formalism used, explanations, or theories of phenomena, are computer programs that generate observation strings when run on the abstract computer. Each computer program is assigned a weight corresponding to its length. The universal probability distribution is the probability distribution on all possible output strings with random input, assigning for each finite output prefix &quot;q&quot; the sum of the probabilities of the programs that compute something starting with &quot;q&quot;. Thus, a simple explanation is a short computer program. A complex explanation is a long computer program. Simple explanations are more likely, so a high-probability observation string is one generated by a short computer program, or perhaps by any of a large number of slightly longer computer programs. A low-probability observation string is one that can only be generated by a long computer program.

Algorithmic probability is closely related to the concept of Kolmogorov complexity. Kolmogorov&#x27;s introduction of complexity was motivated by information theory and problems in randomness, while Solomonoff introduced algorithmic complexity for a different reason: inductive reasoning. A single universal prior probability that can be substituted for each actual prior probability in Bayes&#x27;s rule was invented by Solomonoff with Kolmogorov complexity as a side product. It predicts the most likely continuation of that observation, and provides a measure of how likely this continuation will be.

Solomonoff&#x27;s enumerable measure is universal in a certain powerful sense, but the computation time can be infinite. One way of dealing with this issue is a variant of Leonid Levin&#x27;s Search Algorithm, which limits the time spent computing the success of possible programs, with shorter programs given more time. When run for longer and longer periods of time, it will generate a sequence of approximations which converge to the universal probability distribution. Other methods of dealing with the issue include limiting the search space by including training sequences.

Solomonoff proved this distribution to be machine-invariant within a constant factor (called the invariance theorem).

== Fundamental Theorems ==

=== I. Kolmogorov&#x27;s Invariance Theorem ===

Kolmogorov&#x27;s Invariance theorem clarifies that the Kolmogorov Complexity, or &quot;Minimal Description Length&quot;, of a dataset 
is invariant to the choice of Turing-Complete language used to simulate a Universal Turing Machine:

:formula_6

where formula_7.

=== Interpretation ===

The minimal description formula_8 such that formula_9 serves as a natural representation of the string formula_3 relative to the Turing-Complete language formula_11. Moreover, as formula_3 can&#x27;t be compressed further formula_8 is an incompressible and hence uncomputable string. This corresponds to a scientists&#x27; notion of randomness and clarifies the reason why Kolmogorov Complexity is not computable.

It follows that any piece of data has a necessary and sufficient representation in terms of a random string.

=== Proof ===

The following is taken from 

From the theory of compilers, it is known that for any two Turing-Complete languages formula_14 and formula_15, there exists a compiler formula_16 expressed in 
formula_14 that translates programs expressed in formula_15 into functionally-equivalent programs expressed in formula_14.

It follows that if we let formula_8 be the shortest program that prints a given string formula_3 then:

:formula_22

where formula_23, and by symmetry we obtain the opposite inequality.

=== II. Levin&#x27;s Universal Distribution ===

Given that any uniquely-decodable code satisfies the Kraft-McMillan inequality, prefix-free Kolmogorov Complexity allows us to derive the Universal 
Distribution:

:formula_24

where the fact that formula_11 may simulate a prefix-free UTM implies that for two distinct descriptions formula_8 and formula_27, formula_8 isn&#x27;t 
a substring of formula_27 and formula_27 isn&#x27;t a substring of formula_8.

=== Interpretation ===

In a Computable Universe, given a phenomenon with encoding formula_32 generated by a physical process the probability of that phenomenon is well-defined and equal to the sum over the probabilities of distinct and independent causes. The prefix-free criterion is precisely what guarantees causal independence.

=== Proof ===

This is an immediate consequence of the Kraft-McMillan inequality.

Kraft&#x27;s inequality states that given a sequence of strings formula_33 there exists a prefix code with codewords formula_34 where formula_35 if and only if:

:formula_36

where formula_37 is the size of the alphabet formula_38.

Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s suppose we may order the formula_39 such that:

:formula_40

Now, there exists a prefix code if and only if at each step formula_41 there is at least one codeword to choose that does not contain any of the previous formula_42 codewords as a prefix. Due to the existence of a codeword at a previous step formula_43 codewords are forbidden as they contain formula_44 as a prefix. It follows that in general a prefix code exists if and only if:

:formula_45

Dividing both sides by formula_46, we find:

:formula_36

QED.

== History ==

Solomonoff invented the concept of algorithmic probability with its associated invariance theorem around 1960, publishing a report on it: &quot;A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference.&quot; He clarified these ideas more fully in 1964 with &quot;A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference,&quot; Part I and Part II.

In terms of practical implications and applications, the study of bias in empirical data related to Algorithmic Probability emerged in the early 2010s. The bias found led to methods that combined algorithmic probability with perturbation analysis in the context of causal analysis and non-differentiable Machine Learning

==Sequential Decisions Based on Algorithmic Probability==
Sequential Decisions Based on Algorithmic Probability is a theoretical framework proposed by Marcus Hutter to unify algorithmic probability with decision theory. The framework provides a foundation for creating universally intelligent agents capable of optimal performance in any computable environment. It builds on Solomonoff’s theory of induction and incorporates elements of reinforcement learning, optimization, and sequential decision-making.

===Background===
Inductive reasoning, the process of predicting future events based on past observations, is central to intelligent behavior. Hutter formalized this process using Occam’s razor and algorithmic probability. The framework is rooted in Kolmogorov complexity, which measures the simplicity of data by the length of its shortest descriptive program. This concept underpins the universal distribution MM, as introduced by Ray Solomonoff, which assigns higher probabilities to simpler hypotheses.
Hutter extended the universal distribution to include actions, creating a framework capable of addressing problems such as prediction, optimization, and reinforcement learning in environments with unknown structures.

===The AIXI Model===
The AIXI model is the centerpiece of Hutter’s theory. It describes a universal artificial agent designed to maximize expected rewards in an unknown environment. AIXI operates under the assumption that the environment can be represented by a computable probability distribution. It uses past observations to infer the most likely environmental model, leveraging algorithmic probability.
Mathematically, AIXI evaluates all possible future sequences of actions and observations. It computes their algorithmic probabilities and expected utilities, selecting the sequence of actions that maximizes cumulative rewards. This approach transforms sequential decision-making into an optimization problem. However, the general formulation of AIXI is incomputable, making it impractical for direct implementation.

===Optimality and Limitations===
AIXI is universally optimal in the sense that it performs as well as or better than any other agent in all computable environments. This universality makes it a theoretical benchmark for intelligence. However, its reliance on algorithmic probability renders it computationally infeasible, requiring exponential time to evaluate all possibilities.
To address this limitation, Hutter proposed time-bounded approximations, such as AIXItl, which reduce computational demands while retaining many theoretical properties of the original model. These approximations provide a more practical balance between computational feasibility and optimality.

===Applications and Implications===
The AIXI framework has significant implications for artificial intelligence and related fields. It provides a formal benchmark for measuring intelligence and a theoretical foundation for solving various problems, including prediction, reinforcement learning, and optimization.
Despite its strengths, the framework has limitations. AIXI assumes that the environment is computable, excluding chaotic or non-computable systems. Additionally, its high computational requirements make real-world applications challenging.
Philosophical Considerations
Hutter’s theory raises philosophical questions about the nature of intelligence and computation. The reliance on algorithmic probability ties intelligence to the ability to compute and predict, which may exclude certain natural or chaotic phenomena. Nonetheless, the AIXI model offers insights into the theoretical upper bounds of intelligent behavior and serves as a stepping stone toward more practical AI systems.

<text>Johann Georg Gmelin (8 August 1709 – 20 May 1755) was a German naturalist, botanist and geographer.

== Early life and education ==
Gmelin was born in Tübingen, the son of a professor at the University of Tübingen. He was a gifted child and began attending university lectures at the age of 14. In 1727, he graduated with a medical degree at the age of 18. He then travelled to St Petersburg and obtained a fellowship at the Academy of Sciences in 1728. He lectured at the university from 1730, and in the following year was appointed professor of chemistry and natural history.

At his suggestion, Johann Amman left Hans Sloane in London to take up a post in St Petersburg. The final two volumes of Johann Christian Buxbaum&#x27;s (1693–1730) &quot;Centuria&quot; were published posthumously by Gmelin.

== The Second Kamchatka Expedition ==
Gmelin was elected one out of three professors to join Vitus Bering’s Second Kamchatka Expedition (1733–1743). During the early part of the expedition - leaving St Petersburg in August 1733 - he was accompanied by the young student Stepan Krasheninnikov. They travelled together through the Ural Mountains and western Siberia to Yeniseysk. He described the position of the Yenisey river as a boundary between Europe and Asia and participated in measuring the lowest temperature ever recorded at Yeniseysk. He was also the first person to measure the fact that the level of the Caspian Sea was below that of the Mediterranean Sea. He eventually reached Bering’s headquarters at Yakutsk in September 1736. Unfortunately, Gmelin&#x27;s residence burned on November 8, destroying all his natural history collections and notes plus part of his library. The subsequent summer, he made as many re-collections of specimens as possible to replace the loss. His &quot;Flora Sibirica&quot; (1747–1769) was based on his observations and collections. It contains descriptions of 1178 species, 294 of which he illustrated. His nephew Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin assisted him in editing the final two volumes. A fifth volume of &quot;Flora Sibirica&quot;, mainly on cryptogams, was written by Stepan Krasheninnikov, but was never printed. Gmelin also described the journey in his &quot;Reise durch Sibirien von dem Jahr 1733 bis 1743&quot; (1751–1752).

== Later life ==
Gmelin returned to the University of Tübingen in 1747 and became professor of medicine and, in 1751, director of the university&#x27;s botanic garden. His travel description was published there. It was translated to French and Dutch, but not to Russian, &quot;because it contained uncomplimentary observations and comments on Russians&quot;.

Gmelin was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749.

The plant genus &quot;Gmelina&quot; (Lamiaceae) and several dozen plant and animal species are named after him. Although possibly some are named after Johann Friedrich Gmelin.

<text>Leopold Gmelin (2 August 1788 – 13 April 1853) was a German chemist. Gmelin was a professor at the University of Heidelberg. He worked on the red prussiate and created Gmelin&#x27;s test, and wrote his &quot;Handbook of Chemistry&quot;, which over successive editions became a standard reference work still in use.


== Life ==
Gmelin was a son of the physician, botanist and chemist Johann Friedrich Gmelin and his wife Rosine Schott. Due to his family he early came in contact with medicine and the natural sciences, in 1804 he attended the chemical lectures of his father. In the same year Gmelin moved to Tübingen to work in the family pharmacy, he also studied at the University of Tübingen among other relatives including Ferdinand Gottlieb Gmelin (a cousin) and Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer (husband of a cousin). Supported by Kielmeyer, Gmelin moved to the University of Göttingen in 1805 and later he worked as assistant in the laboratory of Friedrich Stromeyer, by whom he successfully passed his exams in 1809.

Leopold Gmelin returned to Tübingen and again heard the lectures of Ferdinand Gottlieb Gmelin and Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer. In February 1811, Gmelin clashed with the medical student Gutike, according to an insult he challenged him to a duel, without serious injuries. Because duels were forbidden among students the incident was kept a secret at first, he nevertheless came to light. On March 10, Gmelin fled and went to Joseph Franz von Jacquin at the University of Vienna. Focus of his research was the &quot;Black pigment of oxen and calves eyes&quot;, outcome of this work was also the subject of Gmelins dissertation. In 1812, he received his doctorate in Göttingen in absentia. Until 1813, Gmelin went on an extensive study trip through Italy. After his return, he began to work as a Privatdozent at the Heidelberg University since the winter semester of 1813/14, at first he worked on his Habilitation in Göttingen. On 26 September of the following year, he was appointed associate professor in Heidelberg.

In the fall of 1814, he went on another educational trip to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, he remained there until the spring of 1815. Together with his cousin, Christian Gottlob Gmelin he made the acquaintance of René Just Haüy, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Louis Jacques Thénard and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin.

In 1816, Gmelin married Louise in Heidelberg-Kirchheim, a daughter of the Kirchheimer pastor Johann Conrad Maurer, the lawyer Georg Ludwig von Maurer became his brother-in-law. Together they had three daughters and one son, including Auguste, the future wife of the physician Theodor von Dusch.

When the chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth died in Berlin in 1817, Gmelin should have succeeded him. However, he refused and became full Professor of Chemistry at the Heidelberg University. There, a close cooperation with Friedrich Tiedemann evolved with time. The two published &quot;The digestion after tests&quot; in 1826 and established the basis of the physiological chemistry. In the field of digestive chemistry Gmelin later discovered more components of bile and introduced Gmelin&#x27;s test. When Friedrich Wöhler worked on complex cyanogen compounds in 1822, Gmelin assisted him and discovered the &quot;Red prussiate&quot;.

From 1833 to 1838, Gmelin owned a paper mill in the north of Heidelberg situated Schriesheim, he had taken it over in the hope of profit. However, the work in the mill showed to be very time- and money-consuming and at the expense of his academic activity.

In 1817, the first volume of Gmelin&#x27;s Handbook of Chemistry was published. By 1843, it had grown in the fourth edition to 9 volumes. In this edition Gmelin included atomic theory and devoted much more space to the increasingly important organic chemistry. The Handbuch was published in print until the 8th edition in 1990, with an online database, which is less complete and less up-to-date than the print edition. The terms ester and ketone (from German &quot;Aketon&quot;, meaning acetone) were introduced by Gmelin. Until his death Gmelin worked on the fifth edition of the handbook, which had become a valuable source of chemical information and documentation. He also established the basis of an unambiguous classification of inorganic substances, later named the Gmelin system.

At the age of 60, Gmelin suffered a first stroke, and another in August 1850. In both strokes the right half of his body was affected; he was able to recover from the paralysis, but remained debilitated. In the spring of 1851, Gmelin applied for retirement, which was granted a few months later. In the two following years, he suffered increasingly from the effects of a brain illness, at nearly 65 years Leopold Gmelin died in Heidelberg on 13 April 1853, and was buried at the Mountain Cemetery in Heidelberg. The grave complex is located in the department E. There also rests his wife Luise Gmelin and more family members.
== Work ==
In his works Leopold Gmelin dealt with physiology, mineralogy and chemistry. His experimental work was marked by his very thorough and comprehensive way of working; also some writing talent is attributed to him.

Gmelin&#x27;s first physiological work was his dissertation on the black pigment of oxen&#x27;s and calves&#x27; eyes, whose &quot;coloring principle&quot; he tried to fathom. Despite the simplest chemical means he could describe the properties of the pigment and recognized the carbon rightly as the cause of staining. Gmelin&#x27;s most important physiological work was the 1826 released &quot;digestion by experiments&quot;, which he made together with Friedrich Tiedemann. The work, which also described many new working techniques, contained groundbreaking insights into the gastric juice, in which they found hydrochloric acid, and bile, in which Gmelin and Tiedemann among others discovered cholesterol and taurine. Introduced by Gmelin, Gmelin&#x27;s test enabled the detection of bile constituents in the urine of people suffering from jaundice. Furthermore, Gmelin and Tiedemann delivered a new, more refined view of the absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract; they were the founders of modern physiology.

The mineralogical works of Gmelin dealt with the analyses of various minerals, such as the hauyne, a silicate mineral, with which he made his habilitation in Göttingen, or the laumontite and the cordierite. In addition, Gmelin also analysed mineral waters and in 1825 published the work &quot;try of a new chemical mineral system&quot;, since he knew that the time&#x27;s usual division on outer or physical characteristics was inadequate. Leopold Gmelin&#x27;s mineral system was taken largely critical among experts, but the basic idea of an order based on the chemical composition proved to be useful.

Gmelin released the &quot;Handbook of theoretical chemistry&quot;, which was continued as the &quot;Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry&quot; until 1997 in about 800 volumes by the Gmelin Institute, and it is continued by the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker as a database. The manual, even during his lifetime his most important work, was initially intended to be a textbook, which should unite the whole chemical knowledge at that time. Due to the enormous increase in knowledge and the associated development of the handbook into a reference book, Gmelin published a compact textbook of chemistry in 1844. His chemical achievements include the discovery of the croconic acid; he thus had synthesised the first cyclic organic compound, and he made the previously mentioned discovery of the red prussiate.

Leopold Gmelin also developed a forerunner of the Periodic table and improved chemical equipment.

<text>The speed prior is a complexity measure similar to Kolmogorov complexity, except that it is based on computation speed as well as program
length.
The speed prior complexity of a program is its size in bits plus the logarithm of the maximum time we are willing to run it to get a prediction.

When compared to traditional measures, use of the Speed
Prior has the disadvantage of leading to less optimal predictions, and
the advantage of providing computable predictions.

<doc id="402706" wikidata="Q5016887" url="?curid=402706" title="Caerdydd (TV series)">
<text>Caerdydd is a Welsh language television programme set in Cardiff made by Fiction Factory for Welsh public service television station S4C. The series is &quot;a stylish, new drama about modern, urban Welsh-speakers living in a bilingual city&quot; following &quot;a group of modern urban twenty- and thirtysomethings&quot; with &quot;their complex friendships and relationships [set] against a backdrop of relentless socialising&quot;. First commissioned by S4C&#x27;s drama editor Angharad Jones in 2005, as part of a drive by S4C to reach a younger audience, the third series of &quot;Caerdydd&quot; started its run on S4C on 30 March 2008. A fourth series was commissioned and went into production in Spring 2008. It started broadcasting on 14 June 2009.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Caerdydd&quot; (2nd series) has received three nominations for the &quot;2008 Bafta Cymru&quot; awards: Best Screenwriter for Ed Talfan, Best Design for Hayden Pearce and Best Director of Photography (Drama) for Richard Wyn. The second series was also nominated at the &quot;Celtic Media Festival&quot; 2008 for best drama series.

The third series has been nominated for Best Drama Series at the &quot;2009 Bafta Cymru&quot; awards; Roger Wiliams as Best Screenwriter, and Ryland Teifi as Best Actor.

==Criticism==
Criticism of the series focuses mainly on three topics:
* the series was originally set in Dublin and only transferred to Cardiff when commissioned by S4C.
* the large amount of English spoken, not just as some characters are non-Welsh speakers, but also English words in Welsh dialogue.
* explicit sex scenes of both a heterosexual and homosexual nature.

==&quot;Sex In The Assembly&quot; controversy==

A row started after the broadcast of episode three in series III as it emerged that a sex scene was actually filmed &quot;on location&quot; in a toilet room of the Senedd, the Welsh National Assembly building, and not in a television studio. Officials of the National Assembly for Wales Commission who approved the filming for the Neuadd area, the corridors of the building and for one scene in the baby-changing room, were not made aware of the nature of the scene. The scene itself, filmed on 14 March 2008, involves Lea Kennedy (played by Alys Thomas) who is working for an unnamed party group and her much older boyfriend Stephen James (Dewi Rhys Williams) having sexual intercourse. As a result, S4C announced that it was investigating the matter and had contacted producers. One AM, William Graham (Conservative) called for scripts to be vetted more closely in the future.

S4C&#x27;s investigation came to this conclusion: &quot;S4C has looked into the circumstances surrounding the filming of drama series Caerdydd at the Senedd and is satisfied that the production company followed the correct procedures. We are confident that Senedd personnel who dealt with this issue were not misled.&quot;

The National Assembly&#x27;s investigation came to this conclusion: &quot;The National Assembly has carried out a full internal review of the circumstances of the filming of Caerdydd. We can confirm that at no stage of the negotiations about the use of the building for filming, or during the filming itself, was the content of the scene disclosed by the programme makers. Despite this setback, the Assembly is committed to being open and accessible to all, including programme makers, and we sincerely hope that this does not prevent us from working with responsible companies in future.&quot;

<text>Leonid Anatolievich Levin ( ; ; ; born November 2, 1948) is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. 

He is known for his work in randomness in computing, algorithmic complexity and intractability, average-case complexity, foundations of mathematics and computer science, algorithmic probability, theory of computation, and information theory. He obtained his master&#x27;s degree at Moscow University in 1970 where he studied under Andrey Kolmogorov and completed the Candidate Degree academic requirements in 1972.

He and Stephen Cook independently discovered the existence of NP-complete problems. This NP-completeness theorem, often called the Cook–Levin theorem, was a basis for one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems declared by the Clay Mathematics Institute with a $1,000,000 prize offered. The Cook–Levin theorem was a breakthrough in computer science and an important step in the development of the theory of computational complexity.

Levin was awarded the Knuth Prize in 2012 for his discovery of NP-completeness and the development of average-case complexity.
He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and
a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Biography==
He obtained his master&#x27;s degree at Moscow University in 1970 where he studied under Andrey Kolmogorov and completed the Candidate Degree academic requirements in 1972. After researching algorithmic problems of information theory at the Moscow Institute of Information Transmission of the National Academy of Sciences in 1972–1973, and a position as senior research scientist at the Moscow National Research Institute of Integrated Automation for the Oil/Gas Industry in 1973–1977, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1978 and also earned a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1979. His advisor at MIT was Albert R. Meyer.

He is well known for his work in randomness in computing, algorithmic complexity and intractability, average-case complexity, foundations of mathematics and computer science, algorithmic probability, theory of computation, and information theory.

His life is described in a chapter of the book &quot;Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists&quot;.

Levin and Stephen Cook independently discovered the existence of NP-complete problems. This NP-completeness theorem, often called the Cook–Levin theorem, was a basis for one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems declared by the Clay Mathematics Institute with a $1,000,000 prize offered. The Cook–Levin theorem was a breakthrough in computer science and an important step in the development of the theory of computational complexity. Levin&#x27;s journal article on this theorem was published in 1973; he had lectured on the ideas in it for some years before that time (see Trakhtenbrot&#x27;s survey), though complete formal writing of the results took place after Cook&#x27;s publication.

Levin was awarded the Knuth Prize in 2012 for his discovery of NP-completeness and the development of average-case complexity.

He is currently a professor of computer science at Boston University, where he began teaching in 1980.

<text>Vibroplex is the brand of side-to-side mechanical, semi-automatic Morse key first manufactured and sold in 1905 by the Vibroplex Company, after its invention and patent by Horace Greeley Martin of New York City in 1904. The original device became known as a &quot;bug&quot;, most likely due to the original logo, which showed an &quot;electrified bug&quot;. 
The Vibroplex Company has been in business continuously for 119 years, as of 2024. Amateur radio operator Scott E. Robbins, also known by the call sign W4PA, became the eighth owner of the Vibroplex Company on December 21, 2009. The company is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.

The most common Vibroplex models have a single lever with a flat thumbpiece, or paddle, on the left side and a fingerpiece, or knob, on the right side.

The advantage of the key over a standard telegraph key is that it automatically generates strings of one of the two pulses from which Morse code characters are composed, the shortest one or &quot;dot&quot; (or &quot;dits&quot;), so that the operator&#x27;s hand does not have to make the rapid movements necessary to generate multiple dots. When the knob is pressed from the right, it makes a continuous contact suitable for sending &quot;dashes&quot; (or &quot;dahs&quot;). When the paddle is pressed from the left, a horizontal pendulum at the opposite end of the lever is set into motion, intermittently closing a set of contacts, sending a series of short pulses &quot;dots&quot; at a speed that is controlled by the position of the pendulum weight. A skilled operator can achieve sending speeds in excess of 40 words per minute with a bug.

The Vibroplex Original Bug key has been in continuous production for over 100 years, with only minor cosmetic changes. Numerous Vibroplex keys are available to this day; the company presently markets and sells 27 variations of Morse code keys, including the Original Bug, iambic paddles, the Vibrokeyer (an electronic variant of the Original Bug) and traditional straight keys.

<text>Vestmannaeyjar (, sometimes anglicized as Westman Islands) is a municipality and archipelago off the south coast of Iceland.

The largest island, Heimaey, has a population of 4,414, most of whom live in the archipelago&#x27;s main town, Vestmannaeyjabær. The other islands are uninhabited, although six have single hunting cabins. Vestmannaeyjar came to international attention in 1973 with the eruption of Eldfell volcano, which destroyed many buildings and forced a month-long evacuation of the entire population to mainland Iceland. Approximately one-fifth of the town was destroyed before the lava flow was halted by application of 6.8billion litres of cold sea water.

==Geography==

The Vestmannaeyjar archipelago is young in geological terms. The islands lie in the Southern Icelandic Volcanic Zone and have been formed by eruptions over the past 10,000–12,000 years. The volcanic system consists of 70–80 volcanoes both above and below the sea.

Vestmannaeyjar comprises the following islands:

*Heimaey ()
*Surtsey ()
*Elliðaey ()
*Bjarnarey ()
*Álsey ()
*Suðurey ()
*Brandur ()
*Hellisey ()
*Súlnasker ()
*Geldungur ()
*Geirfuglasker ()
*the islands Hani , Hæna , Hrauney and the skerry Grasleysa are called &quot;Smáeyjar&quot; (, small islands).

Total: 

There are 18 islands and about 30 rock stacks and skerries. All the islands have been built up in submarine eruptions and consist of alternating layers of palagonite tuff and lava. The oldest geological formations are in the northern part of Heimaey (&quot;Home Island&quot;), the largest island and the only inhabited one. Basalt columns can be seen in many places, and the sea has eroded the soft rock of the shoreline and scooped out many picturesque coves and grottos, which are among the special features of the islands.

There was a submarine eruption southeast of Hellisey in 1896. The next eruption began on 14 November 1963. It lasted about four years – one of the longest in Icelandic history – and gave birth to Surtsey, the 15th island in the group. In the eruption of 1973 that lasted for 155 days, Heimaey grew by about . The Vestmannaeyjar group is about long and broad, the closest point lying about from the mainland.

==Biodiversity==
There is generally very little snow, but a lot of rain. Owing to this microclimate, returning migrant birds are often first seen in the spring and they set out from the islands in the autumn. All of Iceland&#x27;s seabirds can be found in Vestmannaeyjar: the guillemot, gannet, kittiwake, Iceland gull, and puffin. The puffin is the most plentiful species and is the Vestmannaeyjar emblem. More than 30 species of birds nest in their millions in the cliffs and grassy ledges, and other species make irregular appearances.

There are about 150 plant species in the flora of the islands, and about 80 types of insect have been identified.
The waters around the Vestmannaeyjar contain some of the North Atlantic&#x27;s richest fishing grounds. The two main commercially exploited species in Iceland, cod and haddock, are found in abundance in Vestmannaeyjar. Other species, such as flat-fish, herring and capelin, are also commonly harvested as they migrate through the area in the autumn and winter. Lobsters and ocean perch are found in large numbers in the deep water to the southeast of the islands. Seals, small types of whale and other marine species are also present in large numbers around the islands.

The townspeople have a tradition of guiding stray puffins to safe locations.

==Climate==

With extremely high precipitation considering the latitude, Vestmannaeyjar features a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) under the Köppen climate classification. It is often very windy in the islands, and the highest wind speed measured in Iceland () was recorded in Stórhöfði, the southern of the island&#x27;s two major peninsulae. The main wind directions are easterly and south-easterly. The islands enjoy the country&#x27;s highest average annual temperature, the Gulf Stream having a strong warming effect, especially in winter.


==History and name==



The islands are named after Gaels who had been captured into slavery by Norsemen. The Old Norse word &quot;Vestmenn&quot;, literally &quot;Westmen&quot;, was applied to the Celts of Britain and Ireland, and retained in Icelandic even though Iceland is further west than Britain and Ireland. (In contrast, the Norse Gaels often called themselves Ostmen or Austmenn – &quot;East-men&quot;.)

Not long after Ingólfr Arnarson arrived in Iceland, his blood brother Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson was murdered by the thralls he had brought with him. Ingólfur tracked them down to the Vestmannaeyjar and killed them all in retribution, hence the name Vestmannaeyjar (the islands of the west men). This is speculated to have occurred in AD 875.

On 16 July 1627, in an event known as the Turkish Abductions, the islands were captured by a fleet of three ships of Barbary Pirates from Algiers, who stayed there until 19 July under the control of Ottomans. They had earlier raided the east of Iceland and Murat Reis from Salé in Morocco had commanded another raid in Grindavík in June of that year. The pirates captured 234 people from the islands and took them on a 27-day voyage to Algiers, where most of them spent the rest of their lives in bondage. One of the captives, Lutheran minister Ólafur Egilsson, managed to return in 1628 and wrote a book about his experience. In 1636, ransom was paid for 34 of the captives, and most of them returned to Iceland. After this, a small fort was built on Skansinn (that is, &quot;the bastion&quot;), and an armed guard was established to keep watch from the mountain Helgafell for the approach of ships.

For centuries, the people of the Vestmannaeyjar had a hard struggle for existence, living from fishing and wild birds and their eggs, which they gathered in the cliffs and rock stacks offshore. At the end of the 19th century, when the population was about 600, great changes took place in the lifestyle of the islanders. In 1904, the first motorised boat was purchased, and more followed soon afterwards. By 1930, the population had risen to 3,470. The Vestmannaeyjar have always been at the forefront of developments in fishing and sea food processing, and are the most productive fishing centre in the country. Shortage of fresh water was also a problem for a long time, but a great improvement took place in 1968 when a pipeline was laid.

The area is very volcanically active, like the rest of Iceland. There were two major eruptions in the 20th century: the eruption in 1963 that created the new island of Surtsey, and the Eldfell eruption of January 1973, which created a 200-metre-high mountain where a meadow had been, and caused the island&#x27;s 5,000 inhabitants to be temporarily evacuated to the mainland.

In 2000, Heimaey stave church, a replica of the Haltdalen Stave Church containing a replica of the St Olav frontal, was erected at Skansinn as a gift from the Norwegian government to Iceland, commemorating the conversion of Iceland to Christianity a thousand years before.

==Transportation==
A ferry service runs from Landeyjahöfn (closer) and sometimes under bad conditions Þorlákshöfn (further away). The new Landeyjahöfn harbour opened in 2010, shortening the sailing time to around 40 minutes. A new hybrid electric ferry with a 3 MWh battery and capacity for 550 passengers and 75 cars started operating the 13 km route in July 2019. It uses 100 MWh per week, replacing 35 tonnes of fuel. In bad weather, the longer route to Þorlákshöfn requires fuel.

Vestmannaeyjar Airport was previously served by regular flights to Reykjavík; however, as of 2023, there are no regular flights. Icelandair has served the airport with charter flights for the Þjóðhátið festival in 2022 and 2023.

==Popular culture==

===Festival===
The islands are famed in Iceland for their major annual festival, &quot;Þjóðhátíð&quot; (&quot;The National Festival&quot;), which attracts thousands of people. The festival was first held in 1874, at the same time as the commemoration of the millennium of the settlement of Iceland. Vestmannaeyjar residents had been prevented by bad weather from sailing to the mainland for the festivities and thus celebrated locally.

===Film===
*From 1998 to 2003, the island of Heimaey was home to Keiko the killer whale, star of &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993).
*The film &quot;The Deep&quot; (2012), based on true events, is set on and around the island.

===Literature===
* The islands and their history of volcanic activity play a major role in James Rollins&#x27; seventh Sigma Force novel, &quot;The Devil Colony&quot; (2011).
* The islands feature as the primary location in Yrsa Sigurðardóttir&#x27;s novel &quot;Ashes to Dust&quot;, which uses the 1973 eruption of Eldfell as a key element in the plot.

===Sport===
ÍBV, based on Vestmannaeyjar, are one of the most prominent sports clubs in Iceland, having won several national championships and national cups in both handball and football.

The Westman Islands Golf Club was established in 1938 and is located in the remnants of an extinct volcano. Golf Monthly ranks it as one of the top 200 golf courses in Europe.

<text>A windscreen wiper (Commonwealth English) or windshield wiper (American English) is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, or other debris from a vehicle&#x27;s front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—and some aircraft—are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.

A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, and the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility from its surface. The speed is usually adjustable on vehicles made after 1969, with several continuous rates and often one or more &quot;intermittent&quot; settings. Most personal automobiles use two synchronized &quot;radial&quot;-type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more &quot;pantograph&quot; arms.

On some vehicles, a windscreen washer system is also used to improve and expand the function of the wiper(s) to dry or icy conditions. This system sprays water, or an antifreeze window washer fluid, at the windscreen using several well-positioned nozzles. This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when used in concert with the wiper blades. When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers remove snow or ice. For these types of winter conditions, some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows, embedded heating wire(s) in the glass, or embedded heating wire(s) in the wiper blade; these defroster systems can melt ice or help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windscreen. Less frequently, miniature wipers are installed on headlights to ensure they function optimally.

== History ==

=== Early versions ===

One of the earliest recorded patents for the windscreen wiper is by George J. Capewell of Hartford Connecticut, which was filed on August 6, 1896. His invention was for &quot;windows of slow-moving craft; but it is more particularly adapted and intended for windows of rapidly-moving vehicles, such as high-speed locomotives and cars, with which it is necessary that the observer or driver should have a clear view of the path or track.&quot; Similar to current automotive wiper designs, his invention involves &quot;usually two of these wipers, and they can be secured to the frame below the front board of the vehicle or behind the housing surrounding the window in position to be out of sight and in such manner that one will scrape off the heaviest part of the substance collected upon the glass.&quot; His patent illustration shows a circular window, although the patent notes &quot;it is not essential that the glass be circular in form.&quot; 

Other early designs for the windscreen wiper are credited to Polish concert pianist Józef Hofmann, and to Mills Munitions, Birmingham, who also claimed to have been the first to patent windscreen wipers in England.
At least three inventors patented windscreen cleaning devices at around the same time in 1903; Mary Anderson, Robert Douglass, and John Apjohn. In April 1911, a patent for windscreen wipers was registered by Sloan &amp; Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool, England, for Gladstone Adams of Whitley Bay.
American inventor Mary Anderson is popularly credited with devising the first operational windscreen wiper in 1903. In Anderson&#x27;s patent, she called her invention a &quot;window cleaning device&quot; for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windscreen wipers closely resembles the windscreen wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured, then filed a patent (US 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the US Patent Office on November 10, 1903.


Irish born inventor James Henry Apjohn (1845–1914) patented an &quot;Apparatus for Cleaning Carriage, Motor Car and other Windows&quot; which was stated to use either brushes or wipers and could be either motor driven or hand driven. The brushes or wipers were intended to clean either both up and down or in just one direction on a vertical window. Apjohn&#x27;s invention had a priority date in the UK of 9 October 1903.

John R. Oishei (1886-1968) formed the Tri-Continental Corporation in 1917. This company introduced the first windscreen wiper, Rain Rubber, for the slotted, two-piece windscreens found on many of the automobiles of the time. Today Trico Products is one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of windscreen wipers. Bosch has the world&#x27;s biggest windscreen wiper factory in Tienen, Belgium, which produces 350,000 wiper blades every day. The first automatic electric wiper arms were patented in 1917 by Charlotte Bridgwood.

Inventor William M. Folberth and his brother, Fred, applied for a patent for an automatic windscreen wiper apparatus in 1919, which was granted in 1921. It was the first automatic mechanism to be developed by an American, but the original invention is attributed by others to Hawaiian, Ormand Wall. Trico later settled a patent dispute with Folberth and purchased Folberth&#x27;s Cleveland company, the Folberth Auto Specialty Co. The new vacuum-powered system quickly became standard equipment on automobiles, and the vacuum principle was in use until about 1960. In the late 1950s, a feature common on modern vehicles first appeared, operating the wipers automatically for two or three passes when the windscreen washer button was pressed, making it unnecessary to manually turn the wipers on as well. Today, an electronic timer is used, but originally a small vacuum cylinder mechanically linked to a switch provided the delay as the vacuum leaked off.

=== Intermittent wipers ===
The inventor of intermittent wipers (non-continuous, now including variable-rate wipers) might have been Raymond Anderson, who, in 1923, proposed an electro-mechanical design. (US Patent 1,588,399). In 1958, Oishei et al. filed a patent application describing not only electro-mechanical, but also thermal and hydraulic designs. (US Patent 2,987,747). Then, in 1961, John Amos, an engineer for the UK automotive engineering company Lucas Industries, filed the first patent application in the UK for a solid-state electronic design. (US patent 3,262,042).

In 1963, another form of intermittent wiper was invented by Robert Kearns, an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. (United States Patent 3,351,836 – 1964 filing date). Kearns&#x27;s design was intended to mimic the function of the human eye, which blinks only once every few seconds. In 1963, Kearns built his first intermittent wiper system using off-the-shelf electronic components. The interval between wipes was determined by the rate of current flow into a capacitor; when the charge in the capacitor reached a certain voltage, the capacitor would be discharged, activating one cycle of the wiper motor, and then repeating the process. Kearns showed his wiper design to the Ford Motor Company and proposed that they manufacture the design. Ford executives rejected Kearns&#x27; proposal at the time, but later offered a similar design as an option on the company&#x27;s Mercury line, beginning with the 1969 models. Kearns sued Ford in a multi-year patent dispute that Kearns eventually won in court, inspiring the 2008 feature film &quot;Flash of Genius&quot; based on a 1993 New Yorker article that covered the legal battle.

In March 1970, French automotive manufacturer Citroën introduced more advanced rain-sensitive intermittent windscreen wipers on its SM model. When the intermittent function was selected, the wiper would make one sweep. If the windscreen was relatively dry, the wiper motor drew high current, which would set the control circuit timer to a long delay for the next wipe. If the motor drew little current, it indicated that the glass was still wet, and would set the timer to minimize the delay.

== Power ==

Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel.

Vehicles with air-operated brakes sometimes use pneumatic wipers, powered by tapping a small amount of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air operated motor mounted on or just above the windscreen. These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor.

Early wipers were often driven by a vacuum motor powered by manifold vacuum. This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. That problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump.

Some cars, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s, had variable-speed, hydraulically-driven wipers, most notably the &#x27;61–&#x27;69 Lincoln Continental, &#x27;69–&#x27;71 Lincoln Continental Mark III (but not all &#x27;70 models), and &#x27;63–&#x27;71 Ford Thunderbird. These were powered by the same hydraulic pump also used for the power steering mechanism.

On the earlier Citroën 2CV, the windscreen wipers were powered by a purely mechanical system, a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the speedometer. The wipers&#x27; speed was therefore variable with car speed. When the car was stationary, the wipers were not powered, but a handle under the speedometer allowed the driver to power them by hand.

== Shape ==
Most early wipers used a rubber blade attached to a flat metal base. But as aerodynamic and styling concerns introduced curved windshields, these proved insufficient. In 1945, John W. Anderson, founder of Trico rival Anco, filed a patent for a wiper with branched arms to keep the blade pressed uniformly against both curved and flat glass, adaptable to almost any windscreen curvature. As curved windshields became more popular and widespread, following the debut of the 1947 Studebaker Starlight Coupe, these soon became standard equipment. While they have been superseded by &quot;beam-type&quot; wipers with bodies made of flexible material, this type still remains the most popular.

Wiper blades are made of natural rubber, EPDM rubber (or ethylene propylene rubber) or a combination of both, as natural rubber performs better in cold weather but EPDM rubber doesn&#x27;t &quot;set&quot; and resists better to thermal aging, UV, ozone and tearing. Some manufacturers coat them with graphite.

== Geometry ==


Most wipers are of the pivot (or radial) type: they are attached to a single arm, which in turn is attached to the motor. These are commonly found on many cars, trucks, trains, boats, airplanes, etc.

Modern windscreen wipers usually move in parallel (Fig. 1, below). However, various Mercedes-Benz models and other cars such as the Volkswagen Sharan employ wipers configured to move in opposite directions (Fig. 2), which is mechanically more complex but can avoid leaving a large unwiped corner of the windscreen in front of the front-seat passenger. A cost benefit to the auto-maker occurs when wipers configured to move in opposite directions do not need to be repositioned for cars exported to right hand drive countries such as the UK and Japan.

Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many commercial vehicles, especially buses with large windscreens. Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms. One of the arms is attached to the motor, while the other is on an idle pivot. The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more of the windscreen on each wipe. However, it also usually requires the wiper to be &quot;parked&quot; in the middle of the windscreen, where it may partially obstruct the driver&#x27;s view when not in use. A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver&#x27;s side and a normal arm for the passenger. The Triumph Stag, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow. The reduced height of the windscreen would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge of the windscreen.

A simple single-blade setup with a center pivot (Fig. 4) is commonly used on rear windscreens, as well as on the front of some cars. Mercedes-Benz pioneered a system (Fig. 5) called the &quot;Monoblade&quot;, based on cantilevers, in which a single arm extends outward to reach the top corners of the windscreen, and pulls in at the ends and middle of the stroke, sweeping out a somewhat M-shaped path. This way, a single blade is able to cover more of the windscreen, displacing any residual streaks away from the centre of the windscreen.

Some larger cars in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, especially LH driver American cars, had a pantograph wiper on the driver&#x27;s side, with a conventional pivot on the passenger side. Asymmetric wiper arrangements are usually configured to clear more windscreen area on the driver&#x27;s side, and so are mostly mirrored for left and right-hand-drive vehicles (for example, Fig. 1 vs. Fig 10). One exception is found on the second generations of the Renault Clio, Twingo and Scénic as well as BMW&#x27;s E60 5 Series and E63 6 Series, the Peugeot 206 and the Nissan Almera Tino, where the wipers always sweep towards the left. On right-hand-drive models, a linkage allows the right-hand wiper to move outwards towards the corner of the windscreen and clear more area.

== Other automotive applications ==

=== Rear wipers ===

Some vehicles are fitted with wipers (with or without washers) on the back window as well. Rear-window wipers are typically found on hatchbacks, station wagons / estates, sport utility vehicles, minivans, and other vehicles with more vertically-oriented rear windows that tend to accumulate dust. First offered in the 1940s, they achieved widespread popularity in the 1970s after their introduction on the Porsche 911 in 1966 and the Volvo 145 in 1969.
=== Headlight wipers ===
In the 1960s, as interest in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various headlamp cleaning systems. In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced high pressure fluid headlamp washers on a variety of their 1969 models. In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp. In 1972, headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden.

Headlamp wipers have all but disappeared today with most modern designs relying solely on pressurized fluid spray to clean the headlights. This reduces manufacturing cost, minimizes aerodynamic drag, and complies with EU regulations limiting headlamp wiper use to glass-lensed units only (the majority of lenses today are made of plastic.)

== Other features ==
=== Windscreen washer ===
Most windscreen wipers operate together with a windscreen washer; a pump that supplies a mixture of water, alcohol, and detergent (a blend called windscreen washer fluid) from a tank to the windscreen. The fluid is dispensed through small nozzles mounted on the hood. Conventional nozzles are usually used, but some designs use a fluidic oscillator to disperse the fluid more effectively.

In warmer climates, water may also work, but it can freeze in colder climates, damaging the pump. Although automobile antifreeze is chemically similar to windscreen wiper fluid, it should not be used because it can damage paint. The earliest documented idea for having a windscreen wiper unit hooked up to a windscreen washer fluid reservoir was in 1931, Richland Auto Parts Co, Mansfield, Ohio. Uruguayan racecar driver and mechanic Héctor Suppici Sedes developed a windscreen washer in the late 1930s.

Since 2012, nozzles are replaced on some cars (Tesla, Volvo XC60 2018-2021, Citroen C4 Cactus) by a system called AquaBlade, developed by the company Valeo. This system supplies the washing liquid directly from the spoiler element of the wiper blade. This system suppresses visual disturbances during driving and so reduces the reaction time of the driver in case of incident.

=== Hidden wipers ===
Some larger cars are equipped with hidden wipers (or depressed-park wipers). When wipers are switched off in standard non-hidden designs, a &quot;parking&quot; mechanism or circuit moves the wipers to the lower extreme of the wiped area near the bottom of the windscreen, but still in sight. For designs that hide the wipers, the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the bonnet. The wipers park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom of the windscreen, but out of sight. Late model vehicles that hide wiper blades under the windscreen need to be placed in a service position in order to lift the wiper blade from the windscreen using the wiper service position.

=== Rain-sensing wipers ===
Some vehicles are now available with automatic or driver-programmable windscreen wipers that detect the presence and amount of rain using a rain sensor. The sensor automatically adjusts the speed and frequency of the blades according to the amount of rain detected. These controls usually have a manual override.

Rain-sensing windscreen wipers appeared on various models in the late 20th century, one of the first being the Citroën SM. , rain-sensing wipers are optional or standard on all Cadillacs and most Volkswagens, and are available on many other mainstream manufacturers.

The rain-sensing wipers system currently employed by most car manufacturers today was originally invented and patented in 1978 by Australian, Raymond J. Noack, see U.S. Patents 4,355,271 and 5,796,106. The original system automatically operated the wipers, lights and windscreen washers.

==Bladeless alternatives==

A common alternative design used on ships, called a clear view screen, avoids the use of rubber wiper blades. A round portion of the windscreen has two layers, the outer one of which is spun at high speed to shed water.

High speed aircraft may use bleed air which uses compressed air from the turbine engine to remove water, rather than mechanical wipers, to save weight and drag. Effectiveness of this method also depends on water-repellent glass treatments similar to Rain-X.

== Legislation ==
Many jurisdictions have legal requirements that vehicles be equipped with windscreen wipers. Windscreen wipers may be a required safety item in auto safety inspections. Some US states have a &quot;wipers on, lights on&quot; rule for cars.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1999 television commercial &quot;Synchronicity&quot; for the Volkswagen Jetta automobile, windscreen wipers were synchronized with events seen through the car windows, and with the song &quot;Jung at Heart&quot;, which was commissioned for the advertising agency Arnold Worldwide and composed by Peter du Charme under the name &quot;Master Cylinder&quot;.

<text>The Crucible Theatre, or simply The Crucible, is a theatre in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, which opened in 1971. It hosts regular theatrical performances and the annual World Snooker Championship, which has been held at the venue since 1977. The theatre&#x27;s name refers to crucible steel, which was developed in Sheffield in 1740 and drove the industrialisation of the city. In May 2022 plans were unveiled to build a new 3,000-seat venue nearby with a bridge connecting the two buildings.

==History==

The Crucible Theatre was built by M J Gleeson and opened in 1971. It replaced the Sheffield Repertory Theatre which was based in Townhead Street at the Sheffield Playhouse. In 1967 Colin George, the founding artistic director of the Crucible, recommended a thrust stage for Sheffield, inspired by theatres created by Sir Tyrone Guthrie. Tanya Moiseiwitsch, who had been involved in designing Guthrie&#x27;s theatres, was recruited to design Gleeson&#x27;s theatre as well. The architects Renton Howard Wood Levin Architects were employed and the building itself began to take shape in 1969. It was completed in two years, with the opening performance in November 1971. The opening night performances were &quot;Fanfare&quot;, an evening&#x27;s entertainment showing children acting in an improvised scene, Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Swansong&quot; with Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge, and a music hall finale with a Sheffield brass band.

This demonstrated the versatility of the stage, which has since been adapted for dance and musical performances, as well as classical and modern theatre. The Crucible Theatre also hosts touring productions and the World Snooker Championship.

The audience sits on three sides but no member is more than 22 yards (20 metres) from the performer. Consequently, although it seats 980 people the spectator has an intimate relationship with the activity on stage. Colin George and the administrator David Brayshaw persuaded the Gulbenkian Foundation to finance the building of a professional studio theatre – the 400 seat Tanya Moiseiwitsch Playhouse, which opened with the main house.

In 2001, the Crucible was awarded the Barclays &#x27;Theatre of the Year Award&#x27;. It is a Grade II listed building.

The building went through a £15 million refurbishment between 2007 and late 2009 – opening during that period only for the 2008 and 2009 World Snooker Championships.

The Crucible reopened as a theatre on 11 February 2010 with a production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, with the official reopening by Prince Edward on 18 February 2010.

==Operation==
===Theatre===
Under the distinguished leadership of a succession of artistic directors, The Crucible is a producing theatre, meaning shows are designed and rehearsed in-house. Productions are normally overseen by the Sheffield Theatres Group which also comprises the smaller Playhouse, housed in the same complex, and the large capacity neighbouring receiving venue the Lyceum.

===Sports venue===
 

The World Snooker Championship tournament has been played annually at the Crucible since 1977, and the venue has been lauded for creating a special feeling of excitement around the event. Sports journalist Peter Mason, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, has argued that while the physical aspects of the Crucible are &quot;greatly underwhelming&quot;, there is an undeniably special atmosphere inside the auditorium which means that &quot;against all the modernist odds this relentlessly forward-looking theatre appears to have become infused with memories of the past every bit as easily as if it were a creaking old music hall dating back to the 19th century&quot;.

The World Women&#x27;s Snooker Championship was also held at the Crucible between 1998 and 2003 but was eventually withdrawn due to financial difficulties. The venue has also hosted championships of other indoor sports, such as table tennis and squash.

==Future plans==

In May 2022 plans were unveiled for a new World Snooker Championship venue that would be attached to the existing Crucible Theatre building via a bridge. The new venue is to host up to 3,000 spectators. Snooker promoter Barry Hearn had confirmed talks were underway with Sheffield City Council in April 2022. Hearn added that the tournament could move elsewhere if the new project is not supported but, &quot;the Crucible name is synonymous with snooker globally... so the name has to remain.&quot; The new building has been designed by the architect James Burland, the architect behind the City of Manchester Stadium, along with Arup. The building will also house a snooker museum.

<doc id="402720" wikidata="Q29863" url="?curid=402720" title="Stockholm Bromma Airport">
<text>Stockholm Bromma Airport , officially known as Bromma Stockholm Airport, is an airport located in the Bromma district of Stockholm, Sweden.

Situated approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) northwest of central Stockholm, Bromma Airport is the closest airport to the city compared to the other commercial airports serving the Stockholm Metropolitan Area (IATA airport code STO) including Arlanda, Skavsta, and Västerås.

Opened on 13 May 1936 by King Gustaf V, it was the first airport in Europe to be built with paved runways. With the opening of Stockholm Arlanda Airport in 1962, Bromma lost its role as the primary airport for international traffic, however by 2023, Bromma Airport was still Sweden&#x27;s fourth-busiest airport by passenger traffic, primarily serving domestic routes.

As of 2025 the airport&#x27;s only scheduled route is Västflyg&#x27;s service to Trollhättan. Bromma also operates private flights, ambulance flights and general aviation. From 2016 to 2024, Bromma Airport was predominantly served by Braathens Regional Airlines, which operated flights to various domestic destinations across Sweden before moving its operations to Stockholm Arlanda. 

Stockholm Bromma Airport is located on land owned by the City of Stockholm. The airport is operated by Swedavia, a state-owned company, under a lease agreement with the city which expires in 2038. Both Swedavia and the City of Stockholm wish to close the airport, with its annual losses estimated to come to one billion SEK &quot;(€87 million)&quot; annually; however, the current Swedish government maintains that they will not allow the airport to close before the end of its current mandate period in 2026.
==History==
=== Early proposals and construction (1910s–1930s) ===
The idea of an airport near Stockholm was first proposed in 1918 by Enoch Thulin, one of Sweden&#x27;s leading aviation pioneers. Thulin suggested the establishment of an airport close to the capital city, as the existing airfield at Barkarby was considered too far from Stockholm. At that time, commercial aviation in Stockholm operated from Lindarängen seaplane station.

Elsewhere in Sweden, by 1923, airfields had been inaugurated at Bulltofta in Malmö and Torslanda in Gothenburg. Stockholm City Council subsequently launched an investigation exploring locations for a new city airport, including Årstafältet and Skarpnäck. Eventually, Riksby, a rural location to the west of the city, was deemed suitable for the new airport.

Construction of the new airport at Riksby began in 1933. The site partially included old marshland from an ancient lakebed. This marshy ground continues to affect the runway today, creating a dip in the runway. The airport was originally constructed with four intersecting runways measuring 2,024m, 1,411m 1,219m, and 969m in length. Only one runway remains in use.

Beams from the old Traneberg Bridge were reused in the construction of Bromma&#x27;s first hangar. Both the replacement Traneberg Bridge and Bromma Airport&#x27;s buildings were designed by the same architect, Paul Hedqvist.

=== Inauguration and World War Two (1930s–1940s) ===
Stockholm Bromma Airport was officially opened on 23 May 1936 by King Gustaf V. The following summer nearly 100,000 people visited the airport. Notably, it was the first airport in Europe to feature paved runways from its inception. By 1937, KLM had begun landing its DC-3 aircraft at Bromma.

During World War II, Swedish and British aircraft operated flights between Stockholm Bromma and the United Kingdom. These flights often carried Norwegian and Danish refugees, making the airport a target of interest for German spies. Consequently, two Swedish Douglas DC-3 aircraft, which had taken off from Bromma, were shot down by German forces during the war.

=== Post-War (1940s–1960s) ===

After the war, Stockholm Bromma Airport experienced growth, with two major airlines operating from the airport: Aktiebolaget Aerotransport (ABA), which later became the Swedish partner in Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), and Linjeflyg, the main domestic airline in Sweden that was eventually acquired by SAS.

=== Opening of Arlanda Airport (1960s–1980s) ===
By the 1960s, Bromma&#x27;s runway proved too short for the emerging jet age and intercontinental traffic, such as the DC-8. Additionally, the airport&#x27;s capacity limitations became apparent. Originally built in a rural area, the airport found itself surrounded by an expanding city.

With the opening of Stockholm Arlanda Airport in 1962, all international traffic was transferred from Bromma Airport. In 1984, Linjeflyg and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) also relocated their domestic operations from Bromma to Arlanda. Stockholm Bromma Airport then became primarily used for business jets, general aviation, flight schools, and government purposes. In 1984 several old hangars were repurposed as Bromma Blocks, a retail park. In 1988, SAS moved its headquarters away from Bromma.

=== Deregulated civil aviation and renewed activity (1990s–2024) ===
Following the 1992 deregulation of civil aviation in Sweden, Malmö Aviation began service to Gothenburg, Malmö, and London City Airport. This marked a period of renewed activity for the airport. In 2002, a new control tower was put into use, and the terminal, which had deteriorated after years of neglect, was renovated. Further improvements in 2005 enabled the airport to separate passengers arriving from within and outside of the Schengen area.

In 2003, the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration, announced a bidding process for a contract to build a general aviation terminal for fixed-base operator (FBO) customers. Grafair won the contract and completed the FBO facility on 11 November 2004. The Grafair Jet Center was voted the third best international FBO in May 2008 by Aviation International News.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, all flights at Stockholm Bromma Airport were suspended. Braathens Regional Airlines (BRA), the main airline at Bromma, suspended all flights from 6 April 2020. BRA resumed limited operations in late 2020. On 16 May 2021, the Bromma Airport tram station was opened.

In the summer of 2024, Swedavia conducted runway maintenance at Stockholm Bromma Airport. During this period, BRA relocated its operations to Terminal 3 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport.

=== Commercial decline and future uncertainty (2024–present) ===
In September 2024, Braathens Regional Airlines announced it would cease operations at Stockholm Bromma Airport by the end of 2024 and relocate to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The relocation is part of a seven-year contract with SAS, set to begin in 2025. BRA attributed the decision to the decline in domestic air traffic following the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made its operations at Bromma unsustainable. According to the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, the decision means that Bromma will likely lose around 90% of its traffic, potentially hastening its closure.

In December 2024, Finnair announced that it would also end its flights to Bromma, leaving Västflyg&#x27;s flight to Trollhättan-Vänersborg as the airport&#x27;s only scheduled service. Swedavia confirmed a major reduction of operations at Bromma Stockholm Airport, with the workforce reduced from 120 to 41 employees. Approximately half of the displaced staff were offered positions at other Swedavia airports, primarily Arlanda airport. 

From January 2025, Bromma will operate on a smaller scale, with operations reduced to focusing primarily on private and business jets. ST-Luftfart, a union representing aviation employees, stated that Bromma will resemble more of an airfield than an airport. In December 2024, the Swedish Armed Forces confirmed that a closure of Bromma would not have any consequences for national defence.

== Future plans ==
Stockholm Bromma Airport is located on land owned by the City of Stockholm, but is operated by Swedavia under a lease agreement with the city. The lease was last renewed in 2011 when the centre-right majority in the Stockholm City Council voted to extend it until 2038. Under the terms of the current lease, by this deadline, the airport must be decommissioned, and the surrounding land must have undergone environmental remediation to remove contamination. Several groups have expressed desires for Stockholm Bromma Airport to close sooner than the current 2038 lease expiration.

=== Constraints on expansion ===

Due to its location, Stockholm Bromma Airport&#x27;s potential for expansion is limited by several factors, including noise regulations, spatial constraints, and the obligation to preserve the culturally significant airport buildings. When the airport was inaugurated in 1936, it was located in a largely rural area. However, as Stockholm has expanded, the airport is now surrounded by urban development.

The Airport is required to operate under strict restrictions to minimise impact on the surrounding area. Noise levels must not exceed 55 and 65 dBA in designated areas and the airport is limited to 80,000 flight movements per year by its lease with the City of Stockholm. Average noise emissions must remain below 89 EPNdB, while scheduled flights face a stricter limit of 86 EPNdB. Flight operations are prohibited between 22:00 and 07:00 on weekdays and before 08:00 on weekends, except for emergency and governmental flights.

=== Commercial viability ===
Stockholm Bromma Airport and Stockholm Arlanda Airport are both managed by government-owned airport operator Swedavia. While Bromma&#x27;s close proximity to central Stockholm has been a significant advantage, the expansion of Arlanda, including the completion of the high-speed Arlanda Express rail link in 1999, and addition of a third runway in 2003, has diminished Bromma Airport&#x27;s competitive position.

On September 14, 2020, Swedavia submitted a report to Sweden&#x27;s Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation regarding the operational viability of Stockholm Bromma Airport. The report concluded that maintaining operations at both Bromma and Arlanda was no longer commercially justified. Swedavia recommended consolidating air traffic at Arlanda, which it concluded could accommodate Bromma&#x27;s capacity without requiring substantial infrastructure investments in the short term. It noted that long-term enhancements, including the potential construction of an additional runway at Arlanda, would still be necessary. The report indicated that Bromma was unlikely to remain operational beyond 2038.

In September 2024, BRA&#x27;s main owner Per G. Braathen announced that operating from Bromma had become unprofitable and that BRA would leave by late 2024. The Stockholm Chamber of Commerce welcomed this decision, stating it likely signifies the end of Bromma&#x27;s commercial viability. The Chamber stated that Bromma should be closed promptly, as it had been operating at a loss and relies on revenue from Arlanda, and emphasised their desire to have resources redirected towards the development of Arlanda instead. Finnair also terminated its flights to Helsinki Airport, the airport&#x27;s sole international route, on 31 December 2024, citing unprofitability.

As of December 2024, Swedavia has communicated to the Swedish government that it no longer sees a viable future for Bromma Airport, citing persistently low capacity utilisation and a lack of financial justification for its continued operation within the framework of the national aviation network. Bromma Airport’s continued operations are estimated to cost at least one billion SEK &quot;(€87 million)&quot; annually for Swedavia, with the costs of operating Bromma subsidised by passenger fees other Swedavia airports.

=== Political debate ===
The airport has been a subject of political debate for much of its history. Proponents argue that the airport is necessary to complement Stockholm Arlanda Airport and that it contributes to the region&#x27;s air capacity and business activity. Critics argue that the region requires only one airport, and advocate for the repurposing of the approximately 142 hectares of land occupied by Bromma for housing development.

After the 2014 general election in which Red-Green Alliance gained control of both Stockholm City Council and the national government, plans emerged to close Bromma Airport to redevelop the area for housing. On September 14, 2020, Swedavia submitted a report concluding that maintaining operations at Bromma was no longer commercially justified. This finding bolstered the government&#x27;s position, which in April 2021, announced renewed plans to proceed with the airport&#x27;s closure, aiming to free up space for residential projects. A subsequent government report released in October 2021 suggested a closure timeline between 2025 and 2027, with all air traffic being consolidated at Arlanda.

However, after the 2022 general election, which was won by the right-wing Moderate-led bloc, the newly formed Kristersson cabinet announced that plans to close Bromma early would not proceed. Instead, the government indicated its ambition that the airport could be developed to support electric-powered aircraft.

In February 2024, Stockholm City Council&#x27;s Social Democrat-led leadership confirmed it would not renew Bromma Airport&#x27;s lease beyond 2038, and declared its intent to terminate the agreement with Swedavia regarding Bromma, aiming to establish a new urban district called &quot;Bromma Parkstad&quot;. Christian Democratic Infrastructure Minister Andreas Carlson countered that the government would not accept an early termination of the agreement.

In September 2024, Braathens Regional Airlines announced it will cease operations at Stockholm Bromma Airport by the end of 2024. Upon this announcement, Swedavia&#x27;s CEO, Jonas Abrahamsson, described BRA&#x27;s decision to shift operations to Arlanda as a natural development, reinforcing the need for a political discussion about Bromma&#x27;s future.

In December 2024, Infrastructure Minister Andreas Carlson reiterated that no decision to close Bromma Airport would be made during the current government, as both the government and the Sweden Democrats, under the terms of the Tidö Agreement, insisted that the airport should remain operational.

===Tram===

Tram services from Bromma Airport connect the airport to Alvik, where passengers can transfer to the Stockholm Metro. The tram stop at the airport is called &quot;Bromma flygplats&quot;, and the journey to Alvik takes approximately 9 minutes.

The tram line, known as the Tvärbanan (Line 31), was inaugurated in May 2021. Currently an extension of the Tvärbanan line is under construction, which will extend northward from to Rissne, Kista, and ultimately to Helenelund Station.

===Taxi===
Bromma Stockholm Airport features a taxi stand outside the terminals that exclusively serves &#x27;ecotaxis&#x27; as part of its environmental initiatives. The airport is located approximately 7.4 kilometers from central Stockholm, with typical taxi rides taking around 20 minutes.

===Parking===
Bromma Airport offers parking managed by Swedavia. The main facilities include Express Outdoor Parking (P2) near the terminal and a Pick-up &amp; Drop-off area limited to one-hour stays. The airport also provides designated parking for electric vehicles, motorcycles, and passengers with reduced mobility. Leased parking is available for frequent travellers. The parking areas are open 24 hours a day

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 February 1951, a RAF Vickers Valetta with 22 passengers and crew on a military flight suffered a failure of the No. 2 engine and radio problems while near Stockholm/Bromma Airport. Smoke was also seen coming from beneath the floor of the rear of the cabin. The crew attempted to make an emergency landing at the airport, however due to poor alignment with the runway and poor weather caused the aircraft to overshoot the runway. The aircraft climbed very poorly due to effects of airframe icing and the pilot made a forced belly landing on a clearing on high ground. One person was killed and the aircraft totally destroyed.
*On 1 April 1951, a Scandinavian Airlines Douglas DC-3 on a flight from Copenhagen Kastrup Airport to Stockholm Bromma Airport crash-landed in a field near the airport. None of the 18 passengers or 4 crew members were killed, but the aircraft was a write-off.
*On 15 January 1977, Linjeflyg Flight 618, tail number SE-FOZ, crashed at Kälvesta on approach to Stockholm/Bromma due to ice accretion on the tailplane, leading to a loss of control. All 22 people on board were killed.

<text>It&#x27;s All About Love is a 2003 English-language Danish romance-drama film written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Its narrative can be classified as apocalyptic science fiction, but Vinterberg prefers to call it &quot;a dream&quot;. Unlike the director&#x27;s earlier Danish-language films, &quot;It&#x27;s All About Love&quot; is entirely in English, and stars Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Sean Penn. The production was led by Denmark&#x27;s Nimbus Film, but the film was largely an international co-production, with involvement of companies from nine different countries in total. It was very poorly received by film critics.

==Plot==
In the year 2021, when the earth is devastated by continuous climate changes, with sudden waves of frost (it snows in the middle of summer even in Venice), John, a university lecturer, traveling from Poland to Calgary, stops in New York, to sign divorce papers for his wife Elena. A much beloved figure skating champion, Elena is followed by a very large entourage that takes care of her numerous commitments and all external relations.

John is detained one night in order to attend an important performance by Elena. Set to leave the next morning, he finds that not only has Elena not signed the divorce papers but, with very little explanation, she begs John for help. Still in love, he indulges her. John discovers that Elena is the victim of a strange plot hatched by her own entourage. Three clones, perfectly identical to her, were made to replace her. The official explanation is to relieve her of the burden of an activity that is getting more difficult over time, but the fear is that once the clone training is over, the real Elena can be put aside.

Amid escapes and returns, the killing of the clones, the betrayal of his own family members, John and Elena go away first by train then on foot towards a safe place to resume a new life together, but in the end, they face the cold storms that are ravaging much of the Earth, and die, embraced.

The narration of the finale is entrusted to Marciello, John&#x27;s brother, who in flight over the planet is one of the last survivors but is also destined to perish as it is not possible to land.

==Cast==
* Joaquin Phoenix as John
* Claire Danes as Elena
* Sean Penn as Marciello
* Douglas Henshall as Michael
* Alun Armstrong as David
* Margo Martindale as Betsy
* Mark Strong as Arthur
* Geoffrey Hutchings as Mr. Morrison

==Production==

The film was written, directed, and produced by Thomas Vinterberg over a period of five years. It was produced through Nimbus Film.

At a certain point during production Vinterberg called up Ingmar Bergman and asked him to come and help him finish the film, as he felt he could not complete it himself. Vinterberg recalled that:

:He roared with laughter and said I had to be out of my mind. There was nothing he was less interested in. And he also said I was an idiot that had not decided fast enough what to do after &quot;The Celebration (Festen)&quot;, which he, by the way, called a masterpiece. It was a very contended conversation.

(From an interview in Berlingske Tidende.)

==Reception==
The film was not very successful, and critics mostly panned it. Richard Roeper called the film &quot;like Kubrick with a talent-ectomy&quot; and Jack Matthews of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; declared that &quot;Surely, Vinterberg was high on some inert gas when he embarked on it&quot;. Dennis Lim of the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, however found something to like in the film: 
:&quot;It&#x27;s All About Love&quot; is, by any measure, a colossal folly – ridiculed at its Sundance &#x27;03 premier, supposedly disowned by its stars (rumor has it Claire Danes burst into tears upon seeing the end result) and jettisoned by original distributor Focus. But this $10 million Danish-British-French-U.S.-Japanese-Swedish-Norwegian-German-Dutch co-production is a film maudit for the ages — rapturous and inexplicable in equal measure.

<text>The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) is a trade union supporting journalists in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The NUJ was founded in 1907 and has 20,693 members. It is a member of the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), Trades Union Congress (TUC) affiliated, and a former member of the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).

==Structure==
There is a range of National Councils beneath the NEC, covering different sections and areas of activity. There is an Industrial Council for each of the NUJ&#x27;s &quot;industrial&quot; sectors: 

* Broadcasting (BIC)
* Freelance (FIC)
* Magazine &amp; Books (MABIC) 
* New Media (NMIC)
* Newspapers &amp; Agencies (NAIC)
* Public Relations &amp; Communications.

The Photographers&#x27; Council, while not an industrial council, functions in the same way to campaign on issues relevant to the union&#x27;s photographer, photojournalist and videographer members.

There are also National Executive Councils, covering all sectors, for Ireland and Scotland. The Irish Executive Council, which has a higher degree of autonomy, covers Northern Ireland as well as the Republic. Since 2016, in response to Brexit, the Union&#x27;s Continental European Council further expanded the NUJ&#x27;s remit to include NUJ members working in Continental Europe, in particular for NUJ branches in Paris, Brussels and the Netherlands, to campaign on issues of common interest. 

The union&#x27;s structure is democratic, and its supreme decision-making body is its Delegate Meeting, a gathering of elected delegates from all branches across the UK, Ireland and Europe. Between Delegate Meetings, decisions lie with the NUJ&#x27;s National Executive Council, a committee of 27 people, elected annually by members. The NEC is chaired by a President, elected, along with a Vice-President and Treasurer, at the Delegate Meeting.

The General Secretary (GS) is elected every five years by a national ballot of all members and is held to account and responsible to the National Executive Council (NEC). The current GS is Michelle Stanistreet. The General Secretary is responsible for the day-to-day running of the union and directing its staff. However, important decisions such as authorising industrial action must be taken by the NEC.

==Publications==

The NUJ publishes a magazine called &quot;The Journalist&quot;. 

== Controversies ==
In November 2024, several BBC journalists quit the NUJ and a dozen more journalists in the UK were in the process of handing in their NUJ membership cards. This came after they were urged by the NUJ to wear the colours of Palestinian flag (red, green and black) or a keffiyeh to mark a &#x27;Day of Action For Palestine&#x27;. Charlotte Henry who runs &quot;The Addition&quot;, a media and tech newsletter, announced that she was leaving the union because the industry had become a &#x27;hostile environment for the Jews&#x27;. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has condemned both the NUJ and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), its umbrella union organisation &quot;for failing to support Jewish workers&quot;.

<doc id="402734" wikidata="Q123070" url="?curid=402734" title="Russo-Turkish war (1768–1774)">
<text>The Russo-Turkish war of 1768–1774 was a major armed conflict that saw Russian arms largely victorious against the Ottoman Empire. Russia&#x27;s victory brought the Yedisan between the rivers Bug and Dnieper, and Crimea into the Russian sphere of influence. Through a series of victories accrued by the Russian Empire led to substantial territorial conquests, including direct conquest over much of the Pontic–Caspian steppe, less Ottoman territory was directly annexed than might otherwise be expected due to a complex struggle within the European diplomatic system to maintain a balance of power that was acceptable to other European states and avoided direct Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.

Nonetheless, Russia was able to take advantage of the weakened Ottoman Empire, the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, and the withdrawal of France from Polish affairs to assert itself as one of the continent&#x27;s primary military powers. The war left the Russian Empire in a strengthened position to expand its territory and maintain hegemony over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, eventually leading to the First Partition of Poland. Turkish losses included diplomatic defeats that saw its decline as a threat to Europe, loss over its exclusive control over the Orthodox millet, and the beginning of European bickering over the Eastern Question that would feature in European diplomacy until the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I.

==Background==

===Russian war with Poland===

The war followed internal tensions within Poland which indirectly challenged the security of the Ottoman Empire and its ally, the Crimean Khanate. The true power behind the Polish throne was the Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin and the Imperial Russian Army, with King Stanisław August Poniatowski being elected due to his ties as former favourite to the Empress Catherine II of Russia. Repnin had forcefully passed the Perpetual Treaty of 1768 between Poland and Russia, which was disadvantageous to Poland geopolitically, challenged the political supremacy of Poland&#x27;s Catholic faith, prevented reform of the liberum veto, and allowed Warsaw&#x27;s occupation by Russian troops. Rising unrest led to the massive revolt of the Bar Confederation, which became an alliance of noble, Roman Catholic, and peasant rebels. In the fortified town called Bar, near the Ottoman border, the Bar Confederation was created on 29 February 1768, led by a landed Polish noble named Casimir Pulaski. While the Russian army heavily outnumbered the confederates and defeated them several times in direct battle in Podolia Ukraine, bands of rebels waged low scale guerrilla war throughout Ukraine and southern Poland. On 20 June 1768, the Russian Army captured the fortress of Bar but when one band of surviving confederates fled over to the Turkish border, pursuing troops including Zaporozhian Cossacks, clashed with janissary garrison troops. Polish revolts would dog Russia throughout the war and make it impossible for Catherine II to keep control of Poland.

===Ottoman situation===
In the Ottoman Empire, revolts were widespread. Many noble factions had risen against the power of Sultan Mustafa III and would proceed to break away from the Ottoman Empire. In addition to this decentralization of the Empire the Ottomans were also faced with the revival of a unified Persia, which rose to oppose the Turks in Iraq.

Upon the outbreak of the war the Ottomans seemed to have the upper hand as Russia was suffering from financial strain as a consequence of involvement in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The Ottoman Navy capitalized on the inferiority of the Imperial Russian Navy, even though Russia employed British officers to resolve this weakness. The Ottomans dominated the Black Sea, giving it the advantage of shorter supply lines. The Ottomans were also able to levy troops from their vassal state, the Crimean Khanate, to fight the Russians, but their effectiveness was undermined by constant Russian destabilization of the area. In the years preceding the war the Ottoman Empire had enjoyed the longest period of peace with Europe in its history (1739–1768). Nevertheless, the Ottoman Empire faced internal division, rebellion and corruption compounded by the re-emergence of a unified Persian leadership, under Nader Shah. One clear advantage for the Ottomans was its superior numbers as the Ottoman army was three times the size of its Russian counterpart. However, the new Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin Pasha would prove himself to be incompetent militarily. The Russian army massed along the borders with Poland and the Ottoman Empire, which made it difficult for Ottomans troops to make inroads into Russian territory.

==Russian invasion==
Not content to let the Polish enemy flee over the border, Cossacks followed them into the Ottoman Empire. In the summer of 1768, Mustafa III received reports that the town of Balta had been massacred by Russian paid Zaporozhian Cossacks. Russia denied the accusations, but it was reported that the Cossacks &quot;certainly razed Balta and killed whomever they found&quot;. With the confederates of Poland and the French embassy pushing the sultan along, with many pro-war advisors, the sultan on October 6 imprisoned Aleksei Mikhailovich Obreskov and the entire Russian embassy&#x27;s staff, marking the Ottoman&#x27;s declaration of war on Russia.

After her victories in the war, Catherine II was depicted in portraits dressed in the military uniforms of Great Britain, initially a willing ally because of the trade between the two countries. Great Britain needed bar iron to fuel its nascent Industrial Revolution, as well as other products such as sailcloth, hemp, and timber for the construction and maintenance of its Navy; Russia could provide all these. When the tide of the conflict turned in Russia&#x27;s favour, Britain limited its support, now seeing Russia as a rising competitor in Far Eastern trade, rather than merely as a counterbalance to the French Navy in the Mediterranean. While Russia remained in a superior position in the Black Sea, the withdrawal of British support left Russia unable to do more than shorten its own supply lines and disrupt Turkish trade in the area.

In January 1769, a 70-thousand man Turkish-Tatar army led by Crimean Khan Qırım Giray invaded the lands of central Ukraine. Crimean Tatars, Turks, and Nogais ravaged New Serbia, taking a significant number of slaves.
On September 17, 1769, the Russians began their initial campaign over the Dniester into Moldavia. The elite Ottoman janissaries took heavy casualties from the Russians at Khotyn but managed to hold on; the remainder of the Ottoman army panicked and abandoned the field, and the Russians claimed the fortress. With the Ottomans in disarray the Russians took the capital of Moldavia (Jassy) on October 7. They continued the advance south into Wallachia, occupying its capital Bucharest on November 17. From the capital of Bucharest, the Russians fanned out through the principality, only later being challenged by Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin Pasha at Kagul on Aug 1, 1770. The Russians routed the Grand Vizier&#x27;s forces and allegedly one-third of the Ottoman troops drowned in the Danube trying to escape.

==Caucasian front==
By now, Russia had some troops spread out north of the Caucasus. In 1769, as a diversion, the Russians sent Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben with a small expeditionary force south into Georgia. The Georgians defeated an Ottoman army at Aspindza in 1770. The Siege of Poti on the Black Sea coast by a joint Russo-Georgian force in 1771 failed and Russian troops were withdrawn in the spring of 1772. It was the first time Russian troops had crossed the Caucasus. On the steppes north of the mountains, the later-famous Matvei Platov and 2,000 men fought 25,000 Turks and Crimeans. The Cossack village of Naur was defended against 8,000 Turks and tribesmen.

==Russian Mediterranean expedition==
During the war, a Russian fleet, under Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov, entered the Mediterranean Sea for the first time in history. It was drawn from the Baltic Fleet and was intended to draw Ottoman naval forces out from the Black Sea. In Ottoman Greece, Orlov&#x27;s arrival sparked a Maniot revolt against the Ottoman authorities. However, the Ottoman vizier Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha called on the provincial notables (&quot;ayans&quot;) of Ottoman Albania to mobilize irregular troops, which he used to crush the revolt in 1771.

Just outside the city of Chesma on June 24, 1770, twelve Russian ships engaged twenty-two Turkish vessels and destroyed them with the use of fire ships. The defeat at Chesma demoralized the Ottomans, and bolstered Russian morale. Catherine II used this and other victories over the Turks to consolidate her power domestically, commissioning medals in honour of the battle. Despite their naval success, though, the Russians were unable to capture Constantinople because of Ottoman fortifications, as well as European concerns that it would upset the balance of power.
In 1771, Ali Bey al-Kabir, the Mamluk usurper of Egypt, allied with Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous sheikh of Acre, against their Ottoman overlords. The Egyptian general Abu al-Dhahab marched on Damascus, but the Ottoman governor, Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, convinced him to turn on his erstwhile master. Abu al-Dhahab then marched on Egypt and forced Ali Bey to flee to Zahir. Now, Count Orlov, with Catherine&#x27;s approval, intervened and established friendly relations with the two anti-Ottoman rebels. The Russian fleet provided critical aid in the Battle of Sidon and it bombarded and occupied Beirut. The Russians surrendered Beirut to the pro-Ottoman emir of Mount Lebanon, Yusuf Shihab, only after being paid a large ransom.

In 1773, Yusuf Shihab entrusted the strengthening of Beirut&#x27;s defences to Ahmad al-Jazzar. When the latter began to act independently, Yusuf got into contact with Zahir al-Umar to remove him. Zahir suggested that they enlist the Russians. The Russian squadron, under Captain Ivan Kozhukov, blockaded and bombarded Beirut while Zahir negotiated Jazzar&#x27;s withdrawal. The latter then entered Zahir&#x27;s service, only to rebel against him after a few months. In consequence, the Russians occupied Beirut for a second time, for four months, to force Yusuf to pay a ransom.

==Mediation and ceasefire==
Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain offered to mediate the dispute between Russia and the Ottomans to halt Russia&#x27;s expansion. Austria managed to turn the situation to its advantage by gaining Bukovina District from the Ottomans with a treaty on July 6, 1771. The Austrians maintained their increased military presence on their border with Moldavia and Wallachia, and they increased a subsidy to the cash-starved Ottomans, who had been dabbling in tax farming) and offered unsubstantiated support to the Ottomans against Russia. Catherine II, wary of the proximity of the Austrian army to her own forces and fearing an all-out European war, accepted the loss of Poland and agreed to Frederick II&#x27;s plan to partition Poland. She secretly agreed to return the captured principalities back to the Ottomans, thereby removing Austria&#x27;s fear of a powerful Russian Balkan neighbour. On April 8, 1772, Kaunitz, the Austrian equivalent of Minister of Foreign affairs, informed the Sublime Porte that Austria no longer considered the treaty of 1771 binding.

A ceasefire between Russia and the Ottoman Empire commenced on May 30, 1772, but real negotiations did not begin until August 8. The peace talks broke down almost immediately over the Crimea, but the truce was extended until March 20, 1773.

Both parties had reasons to expand the negotiations, primarily to do with both sides wanting to keep fighting on a single front. The Ottomans were now quelling rebellions from Egypt and Syria and also faced incursions from Persia. The Russians were facing a revival of a centralized Sweden, which had undergone a coup from King Gustav III.

==Final Russian offensive==
On June 20, 1774, the Russian army, under the command of Alexander Suvorov, managed to rout the Ottoman army near Kozludzha. Russia used the victory to force the Ottoman Empire to acquiesce to Russia&#x27;s preferences in the treaty.

==Peace treaty==
On July 21, 1774, the Ottoman Empire had to sign perforce the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The treaty did not overtly take away vast territories from the Ottomans – Poland had already paid the price of alienated territory. According to the treaty:

* The Crimean Khanate formally gained its independence from both powers (but in reality became dependent on Russia and in 1783 was directly annexed after bloody clashes between the Christian and Tatar populations).
* Russia received war reparations of 4.5 million rubles
* The Ottoman Empire ceded to Russia two key seaports, Azov and Kerch, allowing the Russian Navy and merchant fleet direct access to the Black Sea
* Russia gained the territory between the rivers Dnieper and Southern Bug
* The Porte renounced Ottoman claims to Kabardia in the North Caucasus
* Russia gained official status as protector of the Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman Empire, which opened the door for future Russian expansion

As a consequence of the treaty, the Ottomans ceded the northwestern part of Moldavia (later known as Bukovina) to the Habsburg Empire.

Russia quickly exploited Küçük Kaynarca for an easy excuse to go to war and take more territory from the Ottoman Empire.

This war comprised but a small part of the continuous process of expansion of the Russian Empire southwards and westwards during the 18th and 19th centuries.

<text>Pudong is a district of Shanghai located east of the Huangpu, the river which flows through central Shanghai. The name &quot;Pudong&quot; was originally applied to the Huangpu&#x27;s east bank, directly across from the west bank or Puxi, the historic city center. It now refers to the broader Pudong New Area, a state-level new area which extends all the way to the East China Sea.

The traditional area of Pudong is now home to the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone and the Shanghai Stock Exchange and many of Shanghai&#x27;s best-known buildings, such as the Oriental Pearl Tower, the Jin Mao Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Center, and the Shanghai Tower. These modern skyscrapers directly face Puxi&#x27;s historic Bund, a remnant of former foreign concessions in China. The rest of the new area includes the Port of Shanghai, the Shanghai Expo and Century Park, Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve, Nanhui New City, and the Shanghai Disney Resort.

==History==
&quot;Pudong&quot;—literally &quot;The East Bank of the Huangpu River&quot;—originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai&#x27;s Old City and foreign concessions. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of Puxi on the west bank: Huangpu, Yangpu, and Nanshi. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among Huangpu, Yangpu, Nanshi, Wusong and Chuansha County. 

Premier Li Peng announced the policy of Pudong&#x27;s opening and development on April 18, 1990. Speaking at a celebration for the fifth anniversary of the Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation, Li stated that &quot;some policies of the economic and technological zones and Special Economic Zones can be implemented in the Pudong area&quot;. Li stated that future investors from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan were welcomed and that China would provide preferential conditions for cooperation and improve the investment environment. The occasion is often described as Pudong&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot;. Nonetheless, development in the area was slow for the rest of 1990.

On October 1, 1992, the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.

In 1993, the Chinese government set up a Special Economic Zone in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. Deng Xiaoping had initiated its development three years earlier to build further confidence in Reform and Opening Up. Pudong&#x27;s description as a New Area served to distinguish it from existing SEZs. It had even more open policies than existing SEZs, in terms of attracting foreign direct investment and developing the local economy.

The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone and has become a financial hub of modern China. Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the supertall Jin Mao Building (), Shanghai World Financial Center () and Shanghai Tower (), the world&#x27;s first trio of adjacent supertall skyscrapers. These buildings—all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund—now form the most common skyline of Shanghai.

In official discourses on urbanization in China, Pudong is considered the paradigmatic example of the 1990s approach to urbanization.

On May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the State Council had approved the proposal to merge Nanhui District with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the Shanghai Expo, whose grounds now form a public park.

Pudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), Chuansha County, and Nanhui County.

== Climate ==

Pudong has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), influenced by monsoons and Siberian winds as well as rains and typhoons from the Pacific. The average annual temperature in Pudong is . The temperatures are highest on average in July and August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==Government==
Districts of the Direct-Controlled Municipality of Shanghai are administratively on the same level as prefecture-level cities. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a sub-provincial city, which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong&#x27;s size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong. The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai Party Standing Committee.

On April 27, 2015, the People&#x27;s Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.

==Demographics==
Pudong is bounded by the Huangpu River in the west and the East China Sea in the east. Pudong is distinguished from Puxi (&quot;West Bank&quot;), the older part of Shanghai. It has an area of and, according to the 2020 census, a population of 5,681,512 inhabitants, accounting for around 22.8 percent of Shanghai and 1.85 million more than in 2010. Pudong&#x27;s resident population growth is well above national average because it is a popular immigration destination. The 2020 census shows a 8% increase in the last decade, or an annual pace of 0.8%.

Excluding immigrants, the birth rate in 2010 was 0.806% while the death rate is 0.729, resulting a net growth of 0.077%. The total fertility rate is 1.03, well below the replacement level. The district actually has a negative registered household population growth if immigrants are excluded, thus the growth is purely driven by immigration.

The 2020 census shows a population density of 3,006/km2. About 3/4 of the population live in the northern part and part of city center called &quot;Northern Territory&quot;. 1/4 live in the &quot;Southern Territory&quot; that was the Nanhui District. The Northern Territory has a 6,667 population density, while the Southern Territory has 1,732/km2. Suburbs saw a greater increase in population during 2000–2010 with the help of the city&#x27;s suburb expansion policy. Some counties in the traditional city center saw a population decrease.

==Subdistricts and towns==
** – Liuzao town merged into Chuanshaxin town.
*** – Luchaogang town and Shengang Subdistrict merged and form Nanhui Xincheng town.

==Economy==

With the Nanhui District merger in May 2009, the size of Pudong&#x27;s economy grew. The district&#x27;s 2022 gross domestic product amounts to an estimated CN¥1.601 trillion (US$238 billion), with services comprising 74.7% of economic output. Its GDP per capita was CN¥281,180, corresponding to around US$41,755 by nominal values and US$68,647 by purchasing power parity values.

The area is divided into four distinct economic districts. Apart from Lujiazui Trade and Finance Zone, there is Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in mainland China covering approximately in north-east Pudong. The Jinqiao Export Processing Zone is another major industrial area in Pudong covering Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park is a special area for technology-oriented businesses.

The Pudong area continues to experience rapid development, especially in the commercial sector, with 1.3 million square meters of prime office space reaching completion in 2008, more than the previous two years combined.

==Transportation==
The Shanghai Pudong International Airport opened its doors in 1999, shortening the travel time for visitors.

In the same year, Line 2 of the Shanghai Metro commenced services. An extension brought the line further east, where it serves the airport. Other lines, namely Lines 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 16 also have sections that serve parts of Pudong. A magnetic levitation train began operating in 2004, moving passengers between the airport and Longyang Road Metro station.
Pudong is connected to Puxi by several tunnels and four major bridges. The first of these bridges were the Nanpu Bridge (1991) and the Yangpu Bridge (1993). The Xupu Bridge opened in 1996. The latest of these is Lupu Bridge, which is the world&#x27;s second longest arch bridge and was completed in 2002. Currently there are five tunnels that link the two sides, Dapu Rd. Tunnel, the first tunnel across the Huangpu River, Yan&#x27;an Rd. Tunnel, running east–west, and Dalian Rd. Tunnel, running north–south, Fuxing Rd. Tunnel, complementing the Yan&#x27;an Rd. Tunnel, Waihuan Tunnel, one part of Shanghai Outer Ring Express. Two new tunnels linking Lujiazui to Puxi are under construction.

Roads in Pudong have no particular longitudinal or latitudinal orientation. Major thoroughfares Pudong Avenue, Zhangyang Road and Yanggao Road run east–west until Yangpu Bridge before turning gradually to become north–south. Century Avenue crosses all three major roads and extends from Lujiazui to Century Park. Yanggao Road extends south to the A20, Shanghai&#x27;s outer Ring road, which runs east–west from Xupu Bridge and then north–south beginning at the interchange near Renxi Village, when the east–west expressway turns into Yingbin Avenue, headed for Pudong International Airport.

<text>The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) is a British trade union representing drivers of trains including services such as the London Underground (Tube). It is part of the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation and the European Transport Workers&#x27; Federation. At the end of 2019 ASLEF had 24,479 members. Mick Whelan became its General Secretary in 2011.

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1865, North Eastern Railway footplatemen founded a union called the Engine Drivers&#x27; and Firemen&#x27;s Society. It unsuccessfully attempted strike action, as a result of which the NER was able to break up the Society.

In 1872, an industrial union, the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, was founded with the support of the Liberal MP Michael Bass. In 1872, the ASRS reported having 17,247 members, but by 1882, this had declined to only 6,321.

By the end of the 1870s, many UK railway companies had increased the working week from 60 to 66 hours, a 12-hour working day was common and wages had been reduced. The Great Western Railway had not increased wages since 1867, had increased the working day from 10 to 12 hours in 1878 and then reduced wages for all but the most junior drivers and firemen in 1879. In 1879, almost 2,000 GWR locomotive drivers and firemen signed an ASRS petition to the GWR Board of Directors requesting a restoration of the 1867 conditions of service and rates of pay. The GWR reacted by refusing to meet the ASRS representatives and dismissing several of the petitioners from their jobs.

As a result of this defeat, in 1879, drivers and firemen from Griffithstown, Pontypool, South Wales, started to organise to form a craft union separate from the ASRS. At the time there were similar moves in parts of England towards founding an enginemen&#x27;s union. A large number of drivers and firemen met in Birmingham on 9 December 1879 and resolved to form a National Society of Drivers and Firemen. There was a similar move by Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway drivers and firemen at Sheffield, whom the Pontypool group called &quot; &quot;the first founders of the Society&quot;&quot;. The Sheffield branch opened on 7 February 1880 with William Ullyott, one of its leaders, as the first member. Pontypool branch followed on 15 February, led by Charles H. Perry, one of the drivers who had unsuccessfully petitioned the GWR board the previous year. ASLEF officially records Perry as its founder. In the remainder of 1880 ASLEF opened branches at Tondu, Liverpool and Leeds (April), Neath (May), Bradford (June), and Carnforth (July).

ASLEF adopted and published its first Rule Book in 1881. Its title page reproduced a stanza of Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Man was made to mourn: A Dirge&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
If I&#x27;m yon haughty lordling&#x27;s slave
By Nature&#x27;s law designed,
Why was an independent wish
E&#x27;er planted in my mind?
If not, why am I subject to
His cruelty or scorn?
Or why has man the will and pow&#x27;r
To make his fellow mourn?
&lt;/poem&gt;


For economy&#x27;s sake, ASLEF initially chose to be managed by its Leeds branch, as a result of which its first head office was at the Commercial Inn, Sweet Street, Holbeck. It moved to 17 Mill Hill Chambers, Leeds, in 1885, and again to 8 Park Square, Leeds, in 1904. In 1921, it moved to London by buying a house at 9 Arkwright Road, Hampstead, from the family of the late Sir Joseph Beecham, Bt. For a period in the second half of the 20th century ASLEF also owned the next-door house at 7 Arkwright Road.

===Relations with industrial unionism===
In the 1880s ASLEF&#x27;s foundation as a craft union exclusively for one defined part of the railway workforce went against the industrial unionist trend of the New Unionism movement. In 1880, the ASRS denounced the enginemen&#x27;s decision as &quot;very selfish&quot; and &quot;an act of folly&quot; and declared &quot;the sooner our friends the enginemen... give up the idea of forming a separate Association the better&quot;.

ASLEF succeeded in getting more locomotive drivers and firemen to join a trade union, but it has never succeeded in recruiting all drivers or firemen. In 1900, the ASRS wanted amalgamation, but ASLEF proposed federation with the drivers and firemen of the ASRS. A Scheme of Federation was drafted and ASLEF&#x27;s triennial conference adopted it in 1903. There were joint meetings of the Executive Committees of the two unions until 1906 when relations broke down.

In 1907, David Lloyd George, president of the Board of Trade, brought about a conciliation board for the railway industry with representatives of both the companies and their workforces. ASLEF initially welcomed the new board, but later grew dissatisfied with its slow operation and dubbed it a &quot;confiscation&quot; board. In August 1911, the ASRS, ASLEF, the United Pointsmen&#x27;s and Signalmen&#x27;s Society (founded 1880) and the General Railway Workers&#x27; Union (founded 1889) jointly called the United Kingdom&#x27;s first national rail strike. In only two days it succeeded in forcing the Liberal Government to set up a Royal Commission to examine the workings of the 1907 conciliation board.

ASLEF&#x27;s then General Secretary, Albert E. Fox, claimed that the 1911 victory showed there was no need to amalgamate with the ASRS and that Federation should be restored. Fox drafted a new federation scheme, but in October 1911, the ASRS rejected &quot;the further extension of sectionalism contained therein&quot; and expressed the opinion that the success of the national strike indicated &quot;that one railway union will prove to be most beneficial for all railwaymen&quot;. In 1913, the ASRS, GRWU and UPSS duly merged to form the National Union of Railwaymen. ASLEF stayed out of the new industrial union and held to the slogan &quot;organise your trade, federate your industry&quot; coined by Fox.

During the First World War the cost of living increased rapidly. From July 1914 to September 1915, for example, food prices rose 37%. For the duration of the war, the government was in control of the railways. Wages were increased, but at a slower rate than the rise in the cost of living. NUR and ASLEF responded jointly, and forced the Board of Trade to award wage increases in September 1916 and April 1917. In March 1919, the coalition government indicated that it intended to review the War Wage, with a view to reducing it at the end of the year. The NUR and ASLEF started a second national railway strike in September 1919, which in nine days won both a change in pay policy and the reduction of the working day to eight hours.

After 1919, control of the railways was returned to the companies, and in 1923, the Railways Act 1921 merged about 120 of Great Britain&#x27;s railways into four large regional companies. In December 1923, the new companies presented proposals that included some reductions in locomotive men&#x27;s pay and conditions. Negotiations broke down and ASLEF ordered its members to strike, but the NUR instructed its members – including locomotivemen – to stay at work. After another nine-day strike, ASLEF was victorious, but the disagreement between ASLEF and the NUR left deep division.

Eventually ASLEF and the NUR agreed a new Railway Union Federation in 1982, but this failed to end mutual suspicion. About the time that the NUR and National Union of Seamen merged in 1990 to form the RMT the federation broke down, and neither federation nor merger has been negotiated since.

===Major industrial disputes===
ASLEF has taken part in several national rail strikes. The 1911 joint strike with the ASRS, 1919 joint strike with the NUR and 1924 strike of ASLEF without the NUR are described above. ASLEF and the NUR were prominent participants in the 1926 general strike that unsuccessfully sought to prevent British coal companies from reducing mineworkers&#x27; pay and conditions.

In 1955, ASLEF struck against British Railways for seventeen days in a pay dispute. In 1982, both ASLEF and the NUR opposed BR proposals for flexible rostering but they failed to co-ordinate strike action. First the NUR struck against BR and ASLEF instructed its members to cross NUR picket lines. Then after the end of the NUR&#x27;s dispute, ASLEF held its own strike against BR.

There have also been local disputes with individual railway operators such as those with London Underground in 1982, 1989 and 1996.

===Since railway privatisation===

In the latter years of British Rail, train drivers were on a basic salary of around £12,000 per annum, supplemented by a set of enhancements for unsocial hours and overtime approximately £4,000–£5,000. Sunday had never formed part of the basic working week for train drivers in the UK, and was instead worked as overtime. Thus many drivers chose to work Sundays in order to make a better income. British Rail was run in all departments on an overtime culture to reduce overall wage bills resulting from having to employ extra staff to fill what would be uncovered vacancies. This approach had implications for fatigue and excessive hours, which partly contributed to the Clapham Junction rail crash in 1988.

From 1995 onwards, the Railways Act 1993 was implemented to privatise British Rail. In the first few years thereafter, ASLEF negotiated improved pay and conditions of service for its members from the new train operating companies.

Train drivers are now amongst the highest-paid associate professional (as defined by UK government) workers in the UK. ASLEF aims to increase basic pay so the &quot;overtime culture&quot; is reduced or eliminated, in the hope that more jobs will be created to cover the work that is not covered by overtime. The health and safety issues related to overtime and fatigue would also be minimised.

===Membership===
The record of membership numbers is not complete for all years of the society&#x27;s history. However, some key years will give an indication of ASLEF&#x27;s growth in its first seven decades.

==Political affiliation==
ASLEF is affiliated to the Labour Party.

Labour was founded in 1900 as the Labour Representation Committee, and in 1903, ASLEF voted to affiliate to it. In the 1906 general election, ASLEF General Secretary Albert Fox was the LRC candidate for Leeds South, where he polled 4,030 votes. Fox lost to the Liberal incumbent John Lawson Walton, but Lawson Walton died in January 1908 causing a by-election. Fox contested Leeds South a second time, but lost to the new Liberal candidate William Middlebrook.

In June 2015, ASLEF endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Aslef said Corbyn has the &quot;character, vision and policies&quot; needed to win back power for the party. General secretary Mick Whelan said: &quot;Jeremy understands what Labour has to do to win back the hearts, the minds and the votes of ordinary working people in Britain.&quot;

===Election results===
The union sponsored a Labour Party candidate in many Parliamentary elections, from 1906 until 1992. Several of its candidates were elected as Members of Parliament.

<text>Riksdagsmarschen, or the &quot;Riksdag Marsch&quot;, is a suite of music composed by Joseph Martin Kraus, for the grand opening, in 1789, of the Riksdag of the Estates in Sweden. King Gustav III of Sweden wanted to convince the parliament to go along, especially fund, his ongoing war. He was opposed by the nobility but supported by the burgesses and yeomanry, and the king had Kraus write the suite for this occasion, consisting of a march based on the &quot;March of the Priests&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, and a symphony. The legislature financed the king&#x27;s measures which became known as Gustav III&#x27;s Russian War.

<text>The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) was a British trade union. It merged with the MSF to form Amicus in 2001.

==History==
The union was founded in 1992, when the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) finally achieved a merger with the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU), after a hundred years of off-and-on discussions. The new union took the name Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.

The AEU had been affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, while the EETPU was not, so the merged organisation held a ballot on the question of affiliation; members voted for the new union to affiliate. The AEEU was also the largest member of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.

Membership of the new union continued to fall in line with the decline in employment in the sectors it covered. By 2001, its membership had fallen to 728,200. That year, it merged with the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union to form Amicus.

<text>The Trocadéro (), site of the Palais de Chaillot, is an area of Paris, France, in the 16th arrondissement, across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower. It is also the name of the 1878 Trocadéro Palace which was demolished in 1937 to make way for the Palais de Chaillot. The hill of the Trocadéro is the hill of Chaillot, a former village.

==Origin of the name==

The place was named in honour of the Battle of Trocadero, in which the fortified Isla del Trocadero, in southern Spain, was captured by French forces led by the Duc d&#x27;Angoulême, son of the future King of France, Charles X, on 31 August 1823. France had intervened on behalf of King Ferdinand VII of Spain, whose rule was contested by a liberal rebellion. After the battle, the autocratic Spanish Bourbon Ferdinand VII was restored to the throne of Spain.

François-René de Chateaubriand said &quot;To stride across the lands of Spain at one go, to succeed there, where Bonaparte had failed, to triumph on that same soil where the arms of the fantastic man suffered reverses, to do in six months what he couldn&#x27;t do in seven years, that was truly prodigious!&quot;

Nowadays the square is officially named Place du Trocadéro et (and) du 11 Novembre (for the WWI armistice), although it is usually simply called the Place du Trocadéro.

==Palais du Trocadéro==

The hill of Chaillot was first arranged for the 1867 World&#x27;s Fair. For the 1878 World&#x27;s Fair, the (old) &quot;Palais du Trocadéro&quot; (1878–1936) was built here (where meetings of international organizations could be held during the fair). The palace&#x27;s form was that of a large concert hall with two wings and two towers; its style was a mixture of exotic and historical references, generally called &quot;Moorish&quot; but with some Byzantine elements. The architect was Gabriel Davioud.

The concert hall contained a large organ built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll; the first large organ to be installed in a concert hall in France (it has since been modified twice, and eventually moved in 1977 to the Auditorium Maurice Ravel in Lyon, where it is still in use today. The organ was inaugurated during the 1878 World Fair with a concert in which Charles Marie Widor played the premiere of his Symphony for Organ No. 6. The building proved unpopular, but the cost expended in its construction delayed its replacement for nearly fifty years.

Below the building in the space left by former underground quarries, a large aquarium was built to contain fish of French rivers. It was renovated in 1937 but closed again for renovation from 1985 until 22 May 2006. The space between the palais and the Seine is set with gardens, designed by Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, and an array of fountains.

Within its garden, the old palace contained two large animal statues, of a rhinoceros and an elephant, which were removed and stored during the demolition of the old Trocadero palace, and have been located next to the entrance of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay since 1986.

==Palais de Chaillot==

For the Exposition Internationale of 1937, the old Palais du Trocadéro was partly demolished and partly rebuilt and the Palais de Chaillot now tops the hill. It was designed in classicizing &quot;moderne&quot; style by architects Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Jacques Carlu and Léon Azéma. Like the old palais, the Palais de Chaillot features two wings shaped to form a wide arc; reclad and expanded, these wings and the pair of central pavilions are the only remaining portion of the former building. However, unlike the old palais, the wings are independent buildings and there is no central element to connect them: instead, a wide esplanade leaves an open view from the place du Trocadéro to the Eiffel Tower and beyond.

The buildings are decorated with quotations by Paul Valéry, and sculptural groups at the attic level by Raymond Delamarre, Carlo Sarrabezolles and Alfred Bottiau. The eight gilded figures on the terrace of the Rights of Man are attributed to the sculptors Alexandre Descatoire, Marcel Gimond, Jean Paris dit Pryas, Paul Cornet, Lucien Brasseur, Robert Couturier, Paul Niclausse, and Félix-Alexandre Desruelles.

The buildings now house a number of museums:
* the &quot;Musée national de la Marine&quot; (naval museum) and the &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Homme&quot; (ethnology) in the southern (Passy) wing.
* the &quot;Cité de l&#x27;Architecture et du Patrimoine&quot;, including the &quot;Musée national des Monuments Français&quot;, in the eastern (Paris) wing, from which one also enters the &quot;Théâtre national de Chaillot&quot;, a theater below the esplanade.

It was on the front terrace of the palace that Adolf Hitler was pictured during his short tour of the city in 1940, with the Eiffel Tower in the background. This became an iconic image of the Second World War. It is in the Palais de Chaillot that the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1948. This event is now commemorated by a stone, and the esplanade is known as the &quot;esplanade des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (English: &quot;Esplanade of Human Rights&quot;). The Palais de Chaillot was also the initial headquarters of NATO, while the &quot;Palais de l&#x27;OTAN&quot; (now Université Paris Dauphine) was being built.

==Jardins du Trocadéro==

The Jardins du Trocadéro occupy the open space bounded to the northwest by the wings of the Palais de Chaillot and to the southeast by the Seine and the Pont d&#x27;Iéna.

The present garden has an area of and was created for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937), on the design of architect Roger-Henri Expert. The entire site was formerly the garden of the old Palais du Trocadéro, laid out by Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand.

==Others==
Five avenues originate in the Trocadéro: the Avenue Henri-Martin, which links the Trocadéro with the Porte de la Muette and passes in front of the Lycée Janson de Sailly (Janson de Sailly secondary school); the Avenue Paul Doumer, which also approaches the Muette; the Avenue d&#x27;Eylau, which goes to the Mexico Plaza; the Avenue Kléber, which goes to the Place Charles de Gaulle; and the Avenue du Président Wilson, which goes to the Pont de l&#x27;Alma and the Seine.

There is a large municipal library (the Germaine Tillion Library, named after the resistance member and ethnologist) near (to the west of) the Trocadéro&#x27;s square.

The high retaining walls of the Trocadero cemetery (Cimetière de Passy) were constructed by the French industrialist François Coignet.

==Education==
The Institut Culturel Franco-Japonais – École Japonaise de Paris opened at the Trocadéro in 1973. It moved to its current location at Montigny-le-Bretonneux in 1990.

==Access==
== Trocadéro today ==
Trocadéro is a popular tourist destination to take pictures of the Eiffel Tower. The Place du Trocadéro et du 11 Novembre is also where the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. celebrates its French championships victories and where sometimes reporters from the US come to show the evidence of their presence in the French territory.

<text>Josep Irla i Bosch (; 24 October 1874 – 19 September 1958) was a Catalan businessman and politician.
He was a deputy in the Parliament of Catalonia and the Spanish Congress in 1932, as an Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya affiliate. He was also the last President of Parliament of Catalonia at the end of Republican Catalan resistance in the Spanish Civil War, before Francisco Franco abolished the Generalitat of Catalonia. He was elected President of the Parliament of Catalonia on 1 October 1938.
In office, Irla pushed for cooperation with the allies, Basque nationalists and other anti-Francoist groups, though excluding the communists.
He became the President-in-exile of the Generalitat after Lluís Companys was executed.
During his time as President-in-exile, he established a Government in exile, and appointed Josep Tarradellas as Conseller en Cap (Prime Minister). He resigned as President in 1954.

==Early years==

Josep Irla i Bosch was born on 24 October 1874 in Sant Feliu de Guíxols, Baix Empordà. He was the eldest of the three sons of Josep Irla i Rovira, and Rita Bosch Anglada. His father was a laborer who later opened a tavern known as Cas Romagué. His younger brothers were Francesc (1881–1961) and Nicolau (1886–1943), with whom he always maintained a very close relationship, sharing business and political activities. He worked in his father&#x27;s inn when he was young, and studied at the Academy of Arts and Crafts. 
He did not follow any higher study, but was self-taught.

Irla gradually made his way into the world of business and politics. With his brothers, he began industrial and commercial activities in Sant Feliu de Guíxols. He created the company Josep Irla &amp; Co. using the capital of the three brothers. From this base, they opened a factory, producing cork stoppers, that grew over the years. They were consignees of boats and owned a schooner, with which they traded in wine and cork with Barcelona, acting as customs agents.
In 1902, Irla married Florence Bas i Parent, also of Sant Feliu de Guixols and descendant of a family of workers. The couple had no children, but they had two godchildren, Encarnació Pijoan, daughter of peasants from a farm from Romanyà de la Selva, and Lola Aymerich, a cousin who was orphaned.

==Early political career==

When Irla was young he followed the family tradition and identified with federal republicanism. He and his father were the drivers of the Catalan Republican Federal Center of Sant Feliu de Guíxols. They were also members of the Masonic Lodge. His brother Francis was the leader of the weekly &quot;The Program&quot;.
Irla was a pioneer of Catalan republicanism in the region. In a 1905 municipal election, he was elected councilor of the Municipality of Sant Feliu de Guíxols as candidate of Republican Federal Center. He was second deputy mayor and member of the Government Commission. After several changes he became mayor and chaired the City Council from 1906 until 1910. During his term in office he highlighted creation of public services and works, social assistance, promotion of popular culture and an economically austere administration, faced with the damage suffered in the municipality during heavy rains in 1908. He followed the events of Catalan political life and defined a Catalan nationalist and progressive sense. At the beginning of 1911, he participated in the establishment of the Republican Nationalist Federal Union, in the regions of Gerona and was president of the local branch.

Following the death of his father, then provincial deputy, Irla was presented to the provincial election was called to fill the vacancy in the district of La Bisbal. He got the appointment without election for lack of opponents. In the provincial elections of 1913, he was chosen as deputy again, and it happened on until 1923, with the arrival of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, provided by the District of La Bisbal. From his position as deputy, he became involved in the government institution: the Commonwealth of Catalonia. He was a major contributor to the first president of the Commonwealth of Catalonia, Enric Prat de la Riba, and after his death, he continued to occupy positions of great responsibility chaired by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. He was also a member of the board of the Fund Credit Communal.

With the liquidation of the institutions by the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–30) Irla focused on his business while maintaining some political activity. He always maintained a certain political activity within the small scope of action of that period.

==Second Spanish Republic and Generalitat of Catalonia==

After the defeat of the dictatorship, with the proclamation of the Republic Irla was appointed member of the Provisional Provincial Committee of Girona. Immediately after this, Catalan President Francesc Macià named him Commissioner Delegate of the Government of the Generalitat in Girona. In this position, he favored education and culture, especially targeting the popular sectors, promoted the use of the Catalan language in the administration, renewed action for the restoration of archaeological monuments, became interested in social work, and developed public works at low cost with a high impact on large sections of the population.

In the elections for the Provincial Government of Catalonia, an organization was created to prepare and approve a draft statute for the autonomy of Catalonia. Irla and Lluís Companys were chosen vice presidents. Irla was involved in creating the draft statute of autonomy known as the Statute of Núria. On 9 September 1932, the Statute of Catalonia was approved definitively. In early 1932, he created and directed the Federal Republican Party of the Baix Empordà, a county group created basically to formalize a collective commitment to the Republican Left of Catalonia, which he did in the First National Congress of this political formation.

In the elections of the Parliament of Catalonia 20 November 1932, he headed the candidacy of Republican Left of Catalonia in the province of Girona. The victory was total and he was the candidate with the highest proportion of votes in Catalonia. Throughout the republican period, he held various positions of responsibility within the Government of Catalonia.

Irla was appointed General Director of the Interior during the administration of President Macià, but worsening asthma prevented him from taking office, and he was replaced after a few days by . Having recovered, he was appointed Director General of Industry (1933), under the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republican Spanish government, in the two successive governments headed by Manuel Azaña and Alejandro Lerroux, was dismissed after the rise to power of President Diego Martinez Barrio.

In the summer of 1933, he joined the Department of Social Welfare, later becoming Director General of the Department of Social Welfare. In this capacity, he directed projects for the treatment of patients at risk of social exclusion, risk prevention in childhood, and care to retirees without resources. The events of October 1934, with the suspension of the Statute and imprisonment of all members of the Catalan government, put on hold its political action for the next year and a half.

In 1936, with the restoration of the Government of Catalonia, Irla regained his place as Director General. However, the start of the Spanish Civil War hindered his political activity. He assumed leadership of the board of the Hospital General de Catalunya. With successive remodeling of the government, he remained in office, but he resigned before the appointment of Antonio García as Director, representative of the National Confederation of Labour (CNT).
Soon after, in October 1936, he was appointed undersecretary of the Ministry of Culture, a newly created position, with Ventura Gassol as a counselor. Gassol fled to France, having defended threatened people. Therefore, Irla had to expand his role and worked for the functioning of the schools and continued his support for the preservation of archaeological and artistic heritage of Catalonia.

In January 1937, just after President Josep Tarradellas published the decrees which sought to control and provide standards for the entire financial system of Catalonia, Irla was appointed Director General of Heritage and Revenue.

== President of the Parliament of Catalonia ==
On 1 October 1938, with part of the Catalan territory occupied by Nationalist&#x27;s troops and imminent defeat, Irla agreed to become President of the Catalan Parliament. In his inauguration to the presidency, he said: &quot;We were, we are and will be republicans and Catalans, because we are liberals, because it is a feeling of our soul that has led us to feel and know the needs of our people.&quot;

== Exile ==

On 28 January 1939, Josep Irla, President of the Catalan Parliament, began his exile. With 62, he traveled to French territory with his wife, his daughter (Concepción Pijoan), his brother Francis and his sister in law Maria Duran, his nieces and the wife of his brother Nicholas. All their property in Sant Feliu de Guixols were confiscated by the fascist authorities.
He lived for a time in Le Boulou (Roussillon) and later settled in Ceret (Vallespir), where he sought his livelihood dedicated to what he did best: the cork industry. In 1940, he was arrested by the Vichy French authorities and confined in Le Mans, where he could escape and return to Céret.
With the execution of Lluis Companys, 15 October 1940, he refused to travel to America and became, automatically, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia according to the Interior Statute of Catalonia. He was the only modern president who would not set foot, as such, the Palace of the Generalitat. Then, he moved to Cogolin, where he resumed the manufacture of cork stoppers, an activity that provided the resources needed to survive.

==Generalitat de Catalunya in exile ==

The first years in office were marked by adversity, with many limitations for minimum performance, resulting from the Second World War, the problem of Catalan refugees and the permanent danger for those who remained in French territory, together with decreasing economic resources. Whilst in hiding, Irla maintained contacts with Catalans scattered throughout France. 
After the war, he established an Advisory Council of the Presidency of the Generalitat, with the intention of preparing the structures for a future Catalan government. The council included Carles Pi i Sunyer, Pompeu Fabra, Antoni Rovira i Virgili, Josep Carner, Joan Comorera, Manuel Serra i Moret and Pau Padro.

During his rule, he prepared the return of the government to Catalonia, maintained relations with the Catalans who had been living in Spain, he was concerned about the situation of the Catalan exiles outside Spain always keeping alive the democratic will of Catalonia, defending Catalan and international reporting the situation of fascist repression in Spain.

In this regard, in 1946, he directed a memorandum to the United Nations in which, after exposing the historical reality of Catalonia, denounced the actions of the &quot;caudillo&quot; Franco against autonomy, culture and economy of Catalonia, asking United Nations to condemn Francoist Spain and recognize the damage done to Catalonia. He obtained a fragile international condemnation that did not refer to the republican legality crushed by the military uprising, nor made any reference to the repression of Catalonia. However, the disagreement between the Catalans living in exile who hoped that the end of World War II meant the end of Francoist Spain, made into crisis his government in 1947 and he dissolved a year following. At that time, he said: &quot;The work of the Government can not suffer any interruption and will continue to be exercised with the patriotic spirit of always&quot;. Since then, the institutional representation of the Generalitat was customized on its president.

== Death and legacy==

Josep Irla died on 19 September 1958, shortly before turning 82, in Saint-Raphaël, Var (Provence).
In 1981, his remains were moved to Barcelona and received solemnly by the presidents Jordi Pujol and Heribert Barrera. Being celebrated a state funeral in the town of Sant Feliu de Guixols.
Josep Irla had a hard face and was not a great orator nor a charismatic character, but was a political manager and efficient, which he connected important sectors of Catalan society at the time (he won every election which he presented) and retains the continuity of the Catalan institutions at a time of great adversity.
Today, the foundation that bears his name, has undertaken to honor the president and keep his ideological legacy.

<doc id="402758" wikidata="Q1506883" url="?curid=402758" title="Renga">
<text>Renga (, &quot;linked poem&quot;) is a genre of Japanese collaborative poetry in which alternating stanzas, or &quot;ku (&quot;句), of 5-7-5 and 7-7 mora (sound units, not to be confused with syllables) per line are linked in succession by multiple poets. Known as &quot;tsukuba no michi&quot; ( &quot;The Way of Tsukuba&quot;) after the famous Tsukuba Mountain in the Kantō region, the form of poetry is said to have originated in a two-verse poetry exchange by Yamato Takeru and later gave birth to the genres &quot;haikai&quot; () and haiku ().

The genre was elevated to a literary art by Nijō Yoshimoto (, 1320–1388), who compiled the first imperial renga anthology &quot;Tsukubashū&quot; () in 1356. The most famous renga master was Sōgi (, 1421–1502), and Matsuo Bashō (, 1644–1694) after him became the most famous &quot;haikai&quot; master. Renga sequences were typically composed live during gatherings of poets, transcribed oral sessions known as &quot;rengakai&quot; (), but could also be composed by single poets as mainly textual works.

== History==

===Classical and early medieval===
The &quot;origin&quot; of &quot;renga&quot; is traditionally associated with a passage in the , wherein Prince Yamato Takeru speaks to an old man and inquires, by way of a &quot;katauta&quot; poem, how many nights he had slept since passing Nabari and Tsukuba, to which the old man responds by way of another &quot;kata-uta&quot; poem, which combined form a single &quot;sedōka&quot;. Later medieval &quot;renga&quot; poets, out of reverence for this exchange, would refer to their art as &quot;the Way of Tsukuba&quot;, and the first imperial &quot;renga&quot; anthology, the &quot;Tsukubashū&quot;, alludes to it in the title.

The earliest extant renga appears in the Manyoshu (), with its 5-7-5 mora &quot;jōku&quot; ( first stanza) written by Ōtomo no Yakamochi (, 718-785) and its 7-7 mora &quot;geku&quot; ( last stanza) written by a Buddhist nun ( &quot;ama&quot;) in an exchange of poems. This two-stanza form is now called &quot;tanrenga&quot; () to differentiate it from &quot;chōrenga&quot; (), the &quot;hyakuin&quot; renga ( 100-stanza &quot;renga&quot;) to which the general term renga refers.

The &quot;tanrenga&quot; form was popular from the beginning of the Heian Period until the end of cloistered rule ( &quot;insei&quot;) and would sometimes appear in imperial anthologies of waka, which it closely resembled at a glance. It was during the &quot;insei&quot; period that the form began take shape and evolve into &quot;chōrenga&quot;. The Kin&#x27;yōshū () was the first imperial waka anthology to include an explicit section on renga thanks to its compiler Minamoto no Toshiyori (, also Minamoto no Shunrai; ~1055–1129), who was the first to write about renga theory in his poetic treatise &quot;Toshiyori Zuinō&quot; ().

As &quot;tanrenga&quot; gained traction and began to feature more intricate and technically complex links between its two stanzas, the genre gained popularity as a game, and events were held to create the best links. Participants began going beyond the original two stanzas of &quot;tanrenga&quot;, leading to the creation of a &quot;chōrenga&quot; form more formal than games like &quot;iroha&quot; renga, in which 47 stanzas beginning with each of the 47 characters of the &quot;hiragana&quot; writing system were linked. Around the same time, a more straightforward style of linking developed, which also helped to spur the lengthening of the form. Eventually, this 100-stanza renga, which alternated 5-7-5 and 7-7 mora verses (known as &quot;tanku&quot; and &quot;chōku&quot; respectively), became the basis for what we know as renga today.

The vocabulary of &quot;hyakuin&quot; renga was largely limited to the that had been established in the &quot;Kokinshū.&quot; At this time, poets considered the use of &quot;utakotoba&quot; as the essence of creating a perfect &quot;waka&quot;, and use of any other words was considered to be unbecoming of true poetry.

A comparable, though less evolved, tradition of &#x27;linked verse&#x27; (&quot;lián jù&quot; —the same characters as &#x27;renku&#x27;)—evolved in Qin dynasty China, and this Chinese form may have influenced Japanese &quot;renga&quot; during its formative period. However, there are major differences between the two, the Chinese having a unity of subject and a general lightheartedness of tone, neither of which characteristic is present in Japanese &quot;renga&quot;; furthermore, the history of Japanese poetry shows &quot;renga&quot; as an apparently natural evolution.

Around the time of the Shin Kokin Wakashū (, 1205) during the rule of Emperor Go-Tōba, &quot;hyakuin&quot; renga developed enough to gain its first real independence from waka. In the courts, &quot;ushin mushin renga&quot; () sessions were held in which poets and non-poets were divided into &quot;ushin&quot; and &quot;mushin&quot; respectively to link stanzas. The &quot;ushin&quot; side would offer orthodox elegant stanzas while the &quot;mushin&quot; side would offer comical or aesthetically &quot;wilder&quot; stanzas ( &quot;kyōka&quot;), and while submissions from both sides were accepted as appropriate links, the &quot;ushin&quot; were favored. While this practice ended with the Jōkyū Disturbance (1221), it served as an important foundation for the further development of &quot;hyakuin&quot; renga, which placed more emphasis on the skill of poets, and stanzas by many major renga participants of the Go-Tōba court such as Fujiwara no Teika (1162–1241) were later anthologized in the Tsukubashū.

After the Jōkyū Disturbance, renga moved out of the courts. In the popular &quot;hana no moto&quot; renga ( &quot;renga under flowers&quot;), commoners would gather for renga sessions under the flowering trees in spring, a tradition that is estimated to have been around for about 100 years by the start of the Nanboku-chō Period. Some of the later resulting works were anthologized in the Tsukubashū. &quot;Jige&quot; renga ( &quot;underground renga&quot;) was born out of &quot;hana no moto&quot; renga and was pervasive through the Mongol invasions of Japan (1274–1281) and after. The &quot;jige&quot; renga poets were led by Priest Zen’a (, ??–1312), who built upon the rules of &quot;hana no moto&quot; renga but also deviated from them, creating new versions of forms such as 1-day 1000-stanza renga ( &quot;ichi nichi senku renga&quot;)—telling of the genre&#x27;s wide scale. Renga continued to flourish in the courts as well, and the era saw splendid renga gatherings of even 10,000 verses a day, as well as prominent women poets such as the Buddhist nun Nijō ( &quot;nijō no ama&quot;).

It was during the Kamakura Period that the rules ( &quot;shikimoku&quot;) of renga began to develop. At the time, one of the most important rules was &quot;fushimono&quot; (), titular prompts that had to be followed by every stanza in the entire sequence. For instance, a white-black &quot;fushimono&quot; would call for each verse to alternate between including a white object and a black object. Others &quot;fushimono&quot; might be more linguistic, such as requiring odd verses to include three-mora phrases that became a different word upon removal of the middle mora, and even verses to include four-mora phrases that became a different word upon removal of the first and last mora.

===Late medieval===

In the Nanboku-cho Period, renga began to take form and establish itself as a literary genre, largely owing to the efforts of Nijō Yoshimoto (, 1320–1388), who compiled the first imperial renga anthology Tsukubashū () in 1356. As reflected in the collection, aesthetic and linguistically polished &quot;hyakuin&quot; renga that embodied the spirit of the renga session became the foundation for the genre as it is known today.

Yoshimoto was a disciple of Gusai (, also Kyūsei or Kyūzei; 1281–1376), who was taught by Zen’a. Gusai, a commoner priest, was a leading &quot;jige&quot; renga poet and key collaborator in the compilation of the Tsukubashū. Yoshimoto was an aristocrat who served in the Northern Court of the Ashikaga Shogunate. He was originally a waka poet, and his relationship with Gusai, who also had training in courtly literature, brought together common and courtly renga traditions. Yoshimoto was the first to write extensively on renga theory, creating many works laying out the genre’s structure, aesthetic standards, &quot;shikimoku&quot;, and more. One major change he made was to the &quot;fushimono&quot;, which remained part of the title but now only applied to the first verse rather than the whole sequence. Other important rules delineated the maximum numbers of stanzas in which certain topics could appear in a row, and maximum numbers of stanzas in which certain topics could appear across the whole sequence. Many of his aesthetic treatises became important pedagogical artifacts for future renga poets. Through his theoretical work and compilation of the Tsukubashū, Yoshimoto elevated renga to the status of an independent literary genre, setting a crucial foundation for its golden age.

The golden age of renga is widely regarded as the Muromachi Period, during which many of the greatest renga masters were active. The era is epitomized by the poet Sōgi (, 1421–1502) and his compilation of the renga anthology Shintsukubashū (, lit. &quot;New Tsukubashū).

Prior to Sōgi, Ichijō Kaneyoshi (, also Kanera; 1402–1481) aimed to succeed his grandfather Nijō Yoshimoto with his compilation of the Aratamashū (), which he worked on with the priest Sōzei (). However, the anthology was lost and the creation of the next major anthology was completed instead by Sozei’s disciple, Sōgi. Sōzei was one of the &quot;seven sages,&quot; a group of poets all active around that time. They consisted of Priest Chiun (, 1448–1471), Priest Sōzei (, ??–1455), High Priest Gyōjo (, 1405–1469), Priest Nōa (, 1397–1471), Clergyman Shinkei (; 1406–1475), High Priest Senjun ( 1411–1476), and Priest Sōi (, 1418–1485). Their work was later anthologized by Sōgi in his anthology Chikurinshō (), for which Kaneyoshi wrote the preface.

Sōgi, a commoner priest, studied literature extensively, learning renga from Sōzei and classical literature from Kaneyoshi among others. He spent much time travelling the country as a professional renga poet despite the tumultuous political context of his era. His works often feature the relationship between humans and nature. His anthology Shintsukubashū became the successor to the Tsukubashū, and he also composed many other major works, the two most famous being &quot;Three Poets at Minase&quot; ( &quot;Minase Sangin Hyakuin&quot;) and &quot;Three Poets at Yuyama&quot; ( &quot;Yuyama Sangin Hyakuin&quot;). Both sequences were composed by Sōgi and two of his disciples, the priests Shōhaku (, 1143–1527) and Sōchō (, 1448–1532), in 1488 and 1491 respectively. The former was created as an offering for Emperor Go-Toba, the compiler of the Shinkokinshū, making it a formal piece with ceremonial grandeur. &quot;Three Poets at Yuyama,&quot; on the other hand, was created in a more relaxed setting and enjoyed greater popularity in its time. It did, however, maintain also many conventions of renga despite its greater flexibility. The two are now considered the most canonical renga sequences and were widely used pedagogically as standards for the genre.

Sōgi’s death in 1502 was followed by a peak in popularity and then decline of renga as the new genre &quot;haikai&quot; developed. Sōgi’s lineage of disciples continued the renga tradition that ended with the death of Jōha (, 1524–1602), who is considered to be the final major renga poet.

One of Sōgi’s final disciples and also a previous disciple of Sōchō, the priest Sōseki (, 1474–1533), continued the Sōgi line of disciples after the poet’s death. Sōhoku (, ??–1545) was a disciple of Sōchō and Sōseki, and after their deaths rose to the forefront of the renga world. Like his predecessors, he spent much of his time travelling and wrote many works on renga theory in addition to his compositions. His son Sōyō (, 1526–1563) was raised renga poet as well and continued the tradition of travel. He became the top renga master after the death of all of the previous generation. His own death marked the end of the Sōgi tradition of renga, and his contemporary Satomura Jōha rose by default to the top position in the renga world.

Jōha came from another branch of the Sōgi lineage; he studied under Sōseki’s disciple Shūkei (, 1470–1544), and then Shūkei’s disciple Satomura Shōkyū (, 1511–1552) after Shūkei’s death, taking Satomura as his family name. Jōha was heavily involved with major political figures of his time, establishing connections with important people from various factions. His renga moved toward easy understandability and away from the depth and aesthetic standards of the previous tradition. After his death, renga’s period of widespread popularity ended as it was overtaken by haikai, its child genre. Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) became the most prominent haikai poet and was later also famous for his haiku.

&quot;Renga&quot; was a popular form of poetry even in the confusion of Azuchi–Momoyama period. Yet by the end of this era, the &quot;shikimoku&quot; had become so complicated and systematic that they stifled the active imagination that had been a part of the &quot;renga&quot;″s appeal. During the medieval and Edo periods, &quot;renga&quot; was a part of the cultural knowledge required for high society.

In the Edo period, as more and more ordinary citizens became familiar with &quot;renga&quot;, &quot;shikimoku&quot; were greatly simplified. The 36-verse Kasen became the most popular form of &quot;renga&quot;, and commonly spoken words as well as slang and Chinese words were allowed. With this relaxation of the rules, &quot;renga&quot; were able to express broader humor and wit. This style of &quot;renga&quot; came to be called &quot;haikai no renga&quot; (&quot;comical linked verse&quot;) or simply &quot;haikai&quot;, and Matsuo Bashō is known as the greatest &quot;haikai&quot; poet.

The most favored form of &quot;renga&quot; in the Edo period was the , a chain consisting of 36 verses. As a rule, &quot;kasen&quot; must refer to flowers (usually cherry blossoms) twice, and three times to the moon. These references are termed and .

The first stanza of the &quot;renga&quot; chain, the &quot;hokku&quot;, is the forebear of the modern haiku. The stand-alone hokku was renamed haiku in the Meiji period by the great Japanese poet and critic Masaoka Shiki. Shiki proposed &quot;haiku&quot; as an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;haikai no ku&quot; meaning a verse of &quot;haikai&quot;.

For almost 700 years, &quot;renga&quot; was a popular form of poetry, but its popularity was greatly diminished in the Meiji period. Masaoka Shiki, although himself a participant in several &quot;renga&quot;, claimed that . The &quot;renga&quot;&#x27;s appeal of working as a group to make a complete work was not compatible with the European style of poetry gaining popularity in Japan, where a single poet writes the entire poem.

==Structure of and conventions of &quot;Hyakuin&quot; renga==
The &quot;hyakuin&quot; renga sequence begins with the &quot;hokku&quot; (), a 5-7-5 mora verse which was the origin of the late &quot;haiku&quot; genre. Unlike the following verses, the &quot;hokku&quot; in a renga session was expected to reflect the reality of the &quot;ba&quot;—its geographical location, season, etc.—and was also the only verse expected to be able to stand independently as a poem. The composition of the &quot;hokku&quot; was usually left to a skilled poet, and professional renga poets would sometimes be commissioned to write them during their travels. Often, the &quot;hokku&quot; would be written by the guest of the session, with the host responding with the second verse. Two technical conventions that carried over to haiku were the seasonal word &quot;kigo&quot; () and a &quot;cutting word&quot; &quot;kireji&quot; (). The &quot;hokku&quot; was followed by the &quot;wakiku&quot; (), &quot;daisan&quot; (), the names for the second and third verses respectively. Including these two, the rest of the linked verses were called &quot;tsukeku&quot; (), and verses 4-99 together were called the &quot;hiraku&quot; (). The final verse was called the &quot;ageku&quot; ().

During a renga session, the verses were transcribed onto a paper known as &quot;kaishi&quot; (), using four sheets, or eight sides of paper, total. The first side ( &quot;sho-ori&quot;) and last side ( &quot;nagori-no-ori&quot;) contained 8 verses each, and the rest of the sides contained 14 verses each. There were various structural rules based on the paper layout, the most important being the &quot;four blossoms eight moons&quot; rule (). Each sheet should include one verse that used the word &quot;hana&quot; (), or blossoms, and each side should include one verse that used the word &quot;tsuki&quot; () to mean moon specifically (as opposed to &quot;month&quot;). Sometimes the &quot;moon&quot; on the last page would be omitted, leaving seven &quot;moons,&quot; making that half of rule more flexible than the number of &quot;blossom&quot; verses, which were considered more important and were usually composed by senior poets or those of higher social status.

In addition to the &quot;four blossoms eight moons&quot; rule, which served as a major structural pillar for the sequence, there were many other rules regarding topics or lexical categories and their usage in the context of the whole verse. As the vocabulary of renga largely followed the lexicon of &quot;waka&quot;, which used a limited number of words, there was a complex but clear system of what words fell under what category. For instance, &quot;ikkumono&quot; () was a category of specific phrases could only be used once in the entire sequence due to their particularly strong impression, or because they were considered unrefined. Some of the most important topics were the four seasons, love, reminiscence ( &quot;jukkai&quot;; included topics like grief and nostalgia), travel, and Buddhism. Topics like these had to follow the rules of &quot;rinne&quot; ( recurrence), which dictated the maximum and/or minimum number of verses each topic could appear in a row. For instance, spring and autumn verses must repeat for at least three and at most five verses in a row. Love originally followed the same rule, but by Sōgi’s era the minimum had dropped to two, and a single verse was allowed by the Edo Period. Summer, winter, travel, and Buddhism, among many others, could repeat for a maximum of three verses and no minimum, as could reminiscence—here, the subtopic of transiency fell under reminiscence, although it did not for other rules.

There were also many conventions governing the flow of movement throughout the sequence. The term for the proper flow of rhythm, which was also used in other art forms such as Noh theatre, was &quot;jōhakyū&quot; (), or &quot;prelude, development, presto&quot; in the manner of music. The &quot;jō&quot; contained the first ten verses, which should be graceful, smooth, and subtle. The &quot;ha&quot; encompassed the 11th to 78th verses, which should be dynamic and exciting. The last 22 verses were the &quot;kyū&quot;, which should move quickly and easily, particularly the final 8 verses for a clean-cut finish. Another convention regarding the flow of the sequence was the alternation of &quot;mon&quot; ( &quot;pattern&quot;) and &quot;ji&quot; ( &quot;background&quot;) verses. &quot;Mon&quot; verses contained more striking imagery that drew the audience’s attention, while &quot;ji&quot; verses were relatively plainer and inconspicuous verses serving to bring out the vividness of the &quot;mon&quot;. A good flow required skilled but subtle control of the pattern of the two types of verses.

Because in renga each verse is only related to its immediate neighbors, the sequence as a whole does not have very much semantic, stylistic, or thematic unity. Thus, what held the sequence together was the link between each verse, or &quot;tsukeai&quot; (). The most important rule of linking was that links could only exist between two adjacent verses, i.e. a verse could not be connected with any verses aside from the one it was being linked to. There was a wide range of types of links, from linguistic to semantic and direct to indirect; Nijō Yoshimoto listed thirteen types in his poetic treatise on renga, &quot;Renri Hishō&quot; ().

==The renga session==

Renga was typically composed in sessions attended by a group of poets known as the &quot;renju&quot; (, also &quot;renjū&quot;)—usually 7-8, though the number could range widely—, a scribe ( &quot;shuhitsu&quot;), and a master ( &quot;sōshō&quot;). The setting of the session was called the &quot;ba&quot; (), and was an integral part of the poetic sequence, providing aesthetic inspiration and often serving as the basis for the &quot;hokku&quot;. These sessions could take the form of more literary pedagogical events or more informal competitions that drew crowds of spectators.

The scribe sat at a low writing desk ( &quot;bundai&quot;), with the poets sitting facing the desk and the master beside it. The role of the scribe was not only to transcribe the renga sequence, but also to act as an enforcer of the rules of the genre. Once a poet was ready to offer a verse, he would make eye contact with and recite it to the scribe, who would then check to make sure that there were no infractions and write it down. The scribe was usually a younger, aspiring renga poet who would be able to gather experience and recognition through the session. The job required a remarkable memory, as he was required to not only remember all of the rules, but also to instantly recall all the previous verses in order to check the newest verse against them without wasting time looking through the transcription. In addition, the scribe needed both poetic and social skills in order to maintain the pace of the session. He had to decide when to enforce the rules and when to let infractions go for artistic or social reasons. Because renga sessions often gathered people from different social statuses, the scribe needed to facilitate the social dynamic and reject or accommodate verses without offending those of higher standing.

Unlike the scribe, the master was mainly in charge of the aesthetic progression of the sequence, maintaining the &quot;jōhakyū&quot; tempo, &quot;ji&quot; and &quot;mon&quot; pattern, the &quot;yukiyō&quot;, and other aspects of the flow by both judging verses and offering his own. He served as the senior poet who contributed many verses and helped other poets refine theirs, exercising a certain amount of authority over their compositions. Professional renga poets ( &quot;rengashi&quot;) such as Sōgi and his disciples would often be in high demand as masters during their travels.

At the start of the session, the scribe would receive the hokku and write it alongside the &quot;fushimono&quot; to its right. Then he would continue to receive verses; a poet would recite his verse, the scribe would recite it back, and each verse approved by the master and him would be written and recited again. Once the scribe wrote the final verse, he would count the number of verses each participant had contributed and write the tallies at the end of the last page. Finally, he bound the four pages with a string.

Many treatises and handbooks delineated the proper etiquette and conventions for renga sessions, covering everything from behavior and preparation of individual poets to the setup and dynamic of the &quot;ba&quot;. There was some variation between time periods and treatises regarding the ideal conditions of a renga session, and there were no doubt many amateur sessions across the country that did not adhere to the strict rules. As a whole, however, the renga session and its conventions played a crucial role in renga composition, and many extant renga today are products of those sessions where sequences were carefully recorded and preserved.

==Outside Japan==

An early attempt at &quot;renga&quot; in English appeared in 1968 in &quot;Haiku Magazine,&quot; and the same magazine published an issue in 1976 devoted to &quot;renga&quot; and haibun. Since then, many English-language haiku journals have published renga, renku, and other linked poetry.

==Formats==

Here follows a list of the most common formats in which &quot;renga&quot; have been written, both &quot;ushin&quot; (orthodox) &quot;renga&quot;, and &quot;mushin&quot; (renku)

== Terminology ==
* : The first stanza of &quot;renga&quot; with a 5-7-5 mora (sound unit) count. This stanza should be created by a special guest when present, and is considered a part of the greeting in a &quot;renga&quot; gathering. It must include a , as well as a . The kigo usually references the season the &quot;renga&quot; was created in. Hokku, removed from the context of &quot;renga&quot;, eventually became the haiku poetry form.
* : The second stanza of a &quot;renga&quot; with a 7-7 mora count. The person who helped to organize the gathering is honored with creating it. 

* : The third stanza of a &quot;renga&quot; with a 5-7-5 mora count. It must end with the &quot;-te&quot; form of a verb to allow the next poet greater freedom in creating the stanza.
* : Refers to all verses other than the &quot;hokku&quot;, &quot;waki&quot;, &quot;daisan&quot;, and &quot;ageku&quot;.
* : The last stanza of a &quot;renga&quot;. Care should be taken to wrap up the &quot;renga&quot;.
* : A note made after the &quot;ageku&quot; to indicate how many &quot;ku&quot; each poet read.
* : To hold a &quot;renga&quot; gathering. May also be called .
* : To start with the &quot;hokku&quot; of a famous poet such as Bashō and make a new &quot;waki&quot; verse to follow on from there.
* : May also be called or . Refers to the mixing and matching of unlikely word combinations to spur imagination or evoke an image. One of the interesting features of &quot;renga&quot;.
* : The verse in which &quot;tsukeai&quot; happens.

* : Modern &quot;renga&quot; in Bashō&#x27;s style.
* : Literally, &quot;the number of verses&quot;. When the theme of a section is a popular topic such as &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, or &quot;Fall&quot;, the &quot;renga&quot; must continue on that theme for at least two verses but not more than five verses. This theme may then be dropped with one verse on any other topic.
* : A rule to prevent loops repeating the same image or a similar verse.
* : The name for a loop where the same theme, image, or word is repeated. Term taken from Buddhism.
* : A type of loop where the &quot;uchikoshi&quot; and &quot;tsukeku&quot; have an identical image or theme.
* : A stanza prepared beforehand. Should be avoided as stanzas should be created on the spot.
* : To make two stanzas in a row. Happens frequently when the &quot;degachi&quot; rule is used. Should be avoided to let others join.

<text>Josep Tarradellas i Joan, 1st Marquess of Tarradellas (; 19 February 1899 – 10 June 1988) was a Catalonian politician known for his role as the first president of the Government of Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya), after its re-establishment in 1977 under the new Spanish Constitution and the end of the Francoist Dictatorship. He was appointed the role of 125th President of Catalonia in 1954 but spent 23 years in exile until 1977 when he was officially recognised as the President of Catalonia by the Spanish Government.

==Biography==
In 1931, Tarradellas became general secretary of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC). He also was deputy at the Cortes that year, Governance and Health councillor when Francesc Macià was President of the Generalitat of Catalonia as well as Public Services, Economy and Culture councillor during the Spanish Civil War.

Exiled to France since 1939, he became President of the Generalitat of Catalonia when Josep Irla resigned, in 1954.

On 23 October 1977, two years after Francisco Franco&#x27;s death, the President of the Spanish Government Adolfo Suárez met him to negotiate the reestablishment of the Government of Catalonia, an event which occurred. The sentence pronounced at his arrival has become famous as a symbol: &quot;Ciutadans de Catalunya, ja sóc aquí!&quot; (Catalan for &quot;Citizens of Catalonia, I am here at last!&quot;).

He was welcomed solemnly in Barcelona and set up a unity government. He finished his work with the elections for the Catalan Parliament (March 1980), and Jordi Pujol was elected in April.

On 24 July 1986 Tarradellas received the hereditary title &quot;marqués de Tarradellas&quot; (English: Marquess of Tarradellas) from King Juan Carlos I. Tarradellas died in Barcelona in 1988. The hereditary marquessate is now held by his son, who became the second marquess.

On 21 December 2018 the Government of Spain announced that Barcelona–El Prat Airport would be renamed after Tarradellas.
