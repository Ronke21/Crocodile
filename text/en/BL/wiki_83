<text>The Missouri Department of Corrections is the state law enforcement agency that operates state prisons in the U.S. state of Missouri. It has its headquarters in Missouri&#x27;s capital of Jefferson City.

The Missouri Department of Corrections has 21 facilities statewide, including two community release centers. It has more than 11,000 employees, about three-quarters of whom are either certified corrections officers or probation officers. Missouri Department of Corrections has K9 units statewide that are frequently utilized for tracking escapees and, in cases of small or rural law enforcement agencies, criminals who have fled from law enforcement or assisting in search and rescue for missing persons.

==Operations==
Prisoners newly inducted into the MDOC system are placed in diagnostic institutions. Adult male prisoners may go to either the Eastern Reception &amp; Diagnostic Center, the Fulton Reception &amp; Diagnostic Center, or the Western Reception &amp; Diagnostic Center. All incoming female prisoners, including adults and minors under 17 who are convicted on adult charges in adult courts, are sent to the Women&#x27;s Eastern Reception, Diagnostic &amp; Correctional Center. Male prisoners under 17 years of age who are convicted in adult criminal courts were sent to the Northeast Correctional Center which no longer houses minor offenders, minors are now sent to Farmington Correctional Center. Male death row inmates are sent directly to Potosi Correctional Center.

The department has a problem with harassment of and by its employees. During the period from fiscal 2002 to 2006, the state paid out just $340,000 in court awards to its own employees. During the period from 2012 to 2016, the figure was over $7.5 million. Court documents show a culture of sexual and racial harassment by employee against other employees.

Governor Mike Parson signed a contract with Aramark for food and dining services in Missouri prisons. After initially good results, it was reported that the quality of food deteriorated, and supplies included in the contract, such as salt and pepper or cleaning supplies, were not being provided.

Healthcare is contracted out to Centurion Health since 2021. The company was previously owned by Centene Corporation but sold to private investors in 2023. Poor healthcare has been named as a factor in increased death rates among Missouri&#x27;s incarcerated population.

== Fallen officers and staff members ==
Since the establishment of the Missouri Department of Corrections, seventeen officers, 1 Probation and Parole Officer and a District Administrator have died while on duty.

The causes of death are as follows:

==History==
The Cornerstone of the correctional system in Missouri was the Missouri State Penitentiary Jefferson City in 1836.It is the oldest penitentiary west of the Mississippi River. Originally, the facility only housed prisoners; it also had a hospital, and industrial, academic, and vocational programs. MSP was closed in 2004 and Offenders were moved to the newly constructed Jefferson City Correctional Center.

==Death row==

Potosi Correctional Center (PCC) and Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (ERDCC) each have a male death row, while Women&#x27;s Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (WERDCC) has the female death row. ERDCC houses the state&#x27;s execution chamber.

The first person executed in the modern era was George Mercer who was executed at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri on January 6, 1989. The next 61 executions starting with Gerald Smith were done at the Potosi Correctional Center in Potosi, Missouri. Since April 2005, executions have been 25 miles east of Potosi at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. The first execution at Bonne Terre was #63 Donald Jones.

===Deaths of prisoners===
As of March 2010, the leading cause of prisoner deaths is cancer. Heart disease and liver disease are the next most common causes of prisoner deaths. Offender deaths caused by drug overdose are common. Among all Missouri residents, heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease are the most frequent causes of deaths.

==Facilities==

Below is a list of Missouri state correctional facilities.

Former facilities:

* Missouri State Penitentiary (closed in 2004)
* Central Missouri Correctional Center (closed June 2005)

As of 2010 the state did not use private prisons or export prisoners to facilities in other states. Previously, in 1995, the state had exported prisoners to the Newton County Correctional Center in Newton, Texas, to temporarily alleviate overcrowding. The two private prisons in the state (Integrity Correctional Center near Holden, Missouri and Bridewell Prison in Bethany, Missouri) both closed in 2010, and had never held Missouri state inmates.

==Missouri Reentry Conference==
Each year, the Missouri Department of Corrections co-sponsors a Missouri Reentry Conference held in Tan-Tar-A Resort in Osage Beach. The conference, which began in 2005, features speakers and workshops concerning issues surrounding Missouri’s ex-offender population. The conferences average over 300 attendees annually. The intent of the conference is to provide high-quality education and networking opportunities for corrections professionals and community-based partners involved in the state&#x27;s reentry process.

In addition to the Missouri Department of Corrections, other co-sponsors include Area Resources for Community and Human Services (ARCHS), the Missouri Department of Social Services, and Family and Community Trust (FACT).

<text>Elizabeth Gasque Van Exem (February 26, 1886 – November 2, 1989), named Elizabeth Hawley Gasque during her tenure in Congress, was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for South Carolina&#x27;s 6th congressional district from September 13, 1938, to January 3, 1939. She was the first woman elected to Congress from South Carolina.

At the age of 103 years, 249 days, Gasque is the longest-lived member of Congress ever, a record that still stands as of 2023.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Gasque was elected to the House of Representatives on September 13, 1938, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, Allard Henry Gasque. She never actually attended Congress, which was not in session during her months of office.

Gasque was not a candidate for renomination. After her tenure in Congress, she was an author and lecturer.

==Personal life and death==
The Social Security death records state that Gasque was born in 1893, under her later married name of Van Exem. However, census records support the 1886 birth year.

Gasque died aged 103 in Ridgeway, South Carolina where she lived.
She was the longest-lived member of Congress since Maurice Thatcher, who died in 1973.

In 1982, a section of South Carolina state road was named the &quot;Elizabeth Gasque Van Exem Highway.&quot;

<text>Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri (also written Sriyuktesvara, Sri Yukteshwar) (Devanagari: ) (10 May 1855 – 9 March 1936) is the monastic name of Priya Nath Karar (also spelled as Priya Nath Karada and Preonath Karar), an Indian monk and yogi, and the guru of Paramahansa Yogananda and Swami Satyananda Giri. Born in Serampore, West Bengal, Sri Yukteswar was a Kriya yogi, a Jyotishi (Vedic astrologer), a scholar of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads, an educator, author, and astronomer. He was a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya of Varanasi and a member of the &quot;Giri&quot; branch of the Swami order. As a guru, he had two ashrams, one in Serampore and another in Puri, Odisha, between which he alternated his residence throughout the year as he trained disciples.

Described by Tibetologist W.Y. Evans-Wentz as being &quot;of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence,&quot; and with &quot;high character and holiness,&quot; Sri Yukteswar was a progressive-minded figure in 19th-century Serampore society; he regularly held religious festivals throughout the year around the towns and at his ashrams, created a &quot;Satsanga Sabha&quot; spiritual study organization, established syllabi for educational institutions, and re-analyzed the Vedic astrological yugas. Noted for his sharp mind and insightful knowledge, he became a respected guru throughout the greater Kolkata area to his Kriya yoga students, and also regularly invited individuals from all social backgrounds to his ashrams to discuss and exchange ideas on a range of topics.

As a guru, he was nonetheless known for his candid insight, stern nature and strict disciplinary training methods, as noted by his disciple Yogananda in his autobiography. The rigorous nature of his training eventually prepared his disciples, such as Satyananda and Yogananda himself, for their own intense social work in India and America, respectively. In accordance with the high ideals and &quot;penetrating insight&quot; with which he lived, Sri Yukteswar was considered by Yogananda as a &quot;Jnanavatar&quot;, or &quot;Incarnation of Wisdom;&quot; Evans-Wentz felt him &quot;worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him...Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquility to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages.&quot;

==Early life==
Sri Yukteswar was born Priya Nath Karar in Serampore, India to Kshetranath and Kadambini Karar. Priya Nath lost his father at a young age, and took on much of the responsibility for managing his family&#x27;s land holdings. A bright student, he passed the entrance exams and enrolled in Srirampur Christian Missionary College, where he developed an interest in the Bible. This interest would later express itself in his book, &quot;The Holy Science&quot;, which discusses the unity behind the scientific principles underlying Yoga and the Bible. He also attended Calcutta Medical College (then affiliated with the University of Calcutta) for almost two years.

==Personal life==
After leaving college, Priya Nath married and had a daughter. His wife died a few years after their marriage. He was a vegetarian.

==Spiritual career==
He eventually was formally initiated into the Swami order by the Mahant at Bodh Gaya, where he received the monastic name &quot;Sri Yukteswar Giri.&quot; His disciple Satyananda writes that the &quot;Sri&quot; in his name is not a separate honorific but part of his given name: &quot;...many follow the usual procedure (for writing or saying someone&#x27;s name informally) and drop the &#x27;Sri&#x27; and say only &#x27;Yukteshvar&#x27;, but this is not correct. If one wants to put a &#x27;Sri&#x27; at the beginning as in the prevalent fashion, then his name would look as: &#x27;Sri Sriyukteshvar Giri.&#x27;&quot;

In 1884, Priya Nath met Lahiri Mahasaya, who became his guru and initiated him into the path of Kriya Yoga. Sri Yukteswar spent a great deal of time in the next several years in the company of his guru, often visiting Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. In 1894, while attending the Kumbha Mela in Allahabad, he met the guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, Mahavatar Babaji, who asked Sri Yukteswar to write a book comparing Hindu scriptures and the Christian bible. Mahavatar Babaji also bestowed on Sri Yukteswar the title of &#x27;Swami&#x27; at that meeting. Sri Yukteswar completed the requested book in 1894, naming it &quot;Kaivalya Darsanam&quot;, or &quot;The Holy Science&quot;.

==Spiritual life==
Sri Yukteswar converted his large two-story family home in Serampore into an ashram, named &quot;Priyadham&quot;, where he resided with students and disciples. In 1903, he also established an ashram in the seaside town of Puri, naming it &quot;Karar Ashram&quot;. From these two ashrams, Sri Yukteswar taught students, and began an organization named &quot;Sadhu Sabha&quot;.

An interest in education resulted in Sri Yukteswar developing a syllabus for schools, on the subjects of physics, physiology, geography, astronomy, and astrology He also wrote a book for Bengalis on learning basic English and Hindi called &quot;First Book&quot;, and wrote a basic book on astrology. Later, he became interested in the education of women, which was uncommon in Bengal at that time.

Yukteswar was especially skilled in Jyotiṣa (Indian astrology), and prescribed various astrological gemstones and bangles to his students. He also studied astronomy and science, as evidenced in the formulation of his &quot;Yuga theory&quot; in &quot;The Holy Science&quot;.

He had only a few long-term disciples, but in 1910, the young Mukunda Lal Ghosh would become Sri Yukteswar&#x27;s most well known disciple, eventually spreading the teachings of Kriya Yoga throughout the world as Paramahansa Yogananda with his church of all religions – Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. Yogananda attributed Sri Yukteswar&#x27;s small number of disciples to his strict training methods, which Yogananda said &quot;cannot be described as other than drastic&quot;.

Regarding the role of the Guru, Sri Yukteswar said:
Look, there is no point in blindly believing that after I touch you, you will be saved, or that a chariot from heaven will be waiting for you. Because of the guru&#x27;s attainment, the sanctifying touch becomes a helper in the blossoming of Knowledge, and being respectful towards having acquired this blessing, you must yourself become a sage, and proceed on the path to elevate your Soul by applying the techniques of sadhana given by the guru.

Author W.Y. Evans-Wentz described his impression of Sri Yukteswar in the preface to Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;&quot;:
Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration, which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic.

Yukteswar attained mahasamadhi at Karar Ashram, Puri, India on 9 March 1936.

==The Holy Science==

Sri Yukteswar wrote &quot;The Holy Science&quot; in 1894. In the introduction, he wrote:
The purpose of this book is to show as clearly as possible that there is an essential unity in all religions; that there is no difference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but one method by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and that there is but one Goal admitted by all scriptures.

The work introduced many ideas that were revolutionary for the time – for instance, Sri Yukteswar broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dvapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes. He also introduced the idea that the sun takes a &#x27;star for its dual&#x27;, and revolves around it in a period of 24,000 years, which accounts for the precession of the equinox. Research into this theory is being conducted by the Binary Research Institute, which produced a documentary on the topic titled &quot;The Great Year&quot;, narrated by James Earl Jones. There was an Apple iPhone Application for calculating Sri Yukteswar&#x27;s calculations.

The theory of the Sun&#x27;s binary companion expounded by Sri Yukteswar in &quot;The Holy Science&quot; has attracted the attention of David Frawley, who has written about it in several of his books. According to Frawley, the theory offers a better estimate of the age of Rama and Krishna and other important historical Indian figures than other dating methods, which estimate some of these figures to have lived millions of years ago – belying accepted human history.

<text>Roderick Milton Chisholm (; November 27, 1916 – January 19, 1999) was an American philosopher known for his work on epistemology, metaphysics, free will, value theory, deontology, deontic logic and the philosophy of perception.

Richard and Fred Feldman, writing in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,&quot; remark that he &quot;is widely regarded as one of the most creative, productive, and influential American philosophers of the 20th Century.&quot;

==Life and career==

Chisholm graduated from Brown University in 1938 and received his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1942 under Clarence Irving Lewis and D. C. Williams. He was drafted into the United States Army in July 1942 and did basic training at Fort McClellan in Alabama. Chisholm administered psychological tests in Boston and New Haven. In 1943 he married Eleanor Parker, whom he had met as an undergraduate at Brown. He spent his academic career at Brown University and served as president of the Metaphysical Society of America in 1973.

He was editor of &quot;Philosophy and Phenomenological Research&quot; from 1980 until 1986.

Chisholm trained many distinguished philosophers, including Selmer Bringsjord, Fred Feldman, Keith Lehrer, James Francis Ross, Richard Taylor, and Dean Zimmerman. He also had a significant influence on many colleagues, including Jaegwon Kim and Ernest Sosa.

==Philosophical work==

Chisholm&#x27;s first major work was &quot;Perceiving&quot; (1957). His epistemological views were summed up in a popular text, &quot;Theory of Knowledge&quot;, which appeared in three very different editions (1966, 1977, and 1989). His masterwork was &quot;Person and Object&quot;, its title deliberately contrasting with W. V. O. Quine&#x27;s &quot;Word and Object&quot;. Chisholm was a metaphysical Platonist in the tradition of Bertrand Russell, and a rationalist in the tradition of Russell, G. E. Moore, and Franz Brentano; he objected to Quine&#x27;s anti-realism, behaviorism, and relativism.

Chisholm defended the possibility of empirical knowledge by appeal to &quot;a priori&quot; epistemic principles whose consequences include that it is more reasonable to trust your senses and memory in most situations than to doubt them. His theory of knowledge was also famously &quot;foundationalist&quot; in character: all justified beliefs are either &quot;directly evident&quot; or supported by chains of justified beliefs that ultimately lead to beliefs that are directly evident. He also defended a controversial theory of volition called &quot;agent causation&quot; much like that of Thomas Reid. He argued that free will is incompatible with determinism, and believed that we do act freely; this combination of views is known as libertarianism.

He developed a highly original theory of first person thought according to which the things we believe are properties, and believing them is a matter of self-attributing them. (A similar view was developed independently by David Kellogg Lewis, and enjoys considerable popularity, although it is now known mainly through Lewis&#x27;s work.) Chisholm was also famous for defending the possibility of robust self-knowledge (against the skeptical arguments of David Hume), and an objective ethics of requirements similar to that of W. D. Ross. Chisholm&#x27;s other books include &quot;The Problem of the Criterion&quot;, &quot;Perceiving&quot;, &quot;The First Person&quot; and &quot;A Realist Theory of the Categories&quot;, though his numerous journal articles are probably better known than any of these.

Chisholm read widely in the history of philosophy, and frequently referred to the work of Ancient, Medieval, Modern, and even Continental philosophers (although the use he made of this material has sometimes been challenged). Nonetheless, he greatly respected the history of philosophy, in the face of a prevailing indifference among Analytic philosophers. Chisholm translated some work by Brentano and by Husserl, and contributed to the post-1970 renaissance of mereology.

===Direct attribution theory of reference===
Chisholm argued for the primacy of the mental over linguistic intentionality, as suggested in the title of &quot;Person and Object&quot; (1976) that was deliberately contrasted with Quine&#x27;s &quot;Word and Object&quot; (1960). In this regard, he defended the direct attribution theory of reference in &quot;The First Person&quot; (1981). He argues that we refer to things other than ourselves by indirectly attributing properties to them, and that we indirectly or relatively attribute properties to them by directly attributing properties to ourselves. Suppose the following bed scene:

:(1) a man M is in bed B with a woman W, namely, M-B-W, or
:(2) a woman W is in bed B with a man M, namely, W-B-M.

If I were M and &quot;U&quot; were W, then I could directly attribute to myself the property (1) or M-B-W, while indirectly to &quot;U&quot; the property (2) or W-B-M, &quot;thereby referring to &quot;U&quot;&quot;. That is, to say (1) is &quot;relatively&quot; to say (2), or to explicate M-B-W is to implicate W-B-M.

His idea of indirect attribution (1981) is relevant to John Searle&#x27;s &quot;indirect speech act&quot; (1975) and Paul Grice&#x27;s &quot;implicature&quot; (1975), in addition to entailment.

===&quot;Chisholming&quot;===
Stylistically, Chisholm was known for formulating definitions and subsequently revising them in the light of counterexamples. This led to a joke definition of a new verb: 

While intended as a joke, the term has found some use in serious philosophical papers (for example, Kevin Meeker&#x27;s &quot;Chisholming away at Plantinga&#x27;s critique of epistemic deontology&quot;).

==Persistence and Identity==

In his book &quot;Person and Object,&quot; Chisholm endorses a mereological essentialism for everyday objects such as tables and chairs. He distinguishes two ways of thinking about identity of such objects and the way in which they may lose or gain parts over time: a &quot;strict philosophical sense&quot; and a &quot;loose sense.&quot; In a strict philosophical sense, we must say that everyday vulgar objects do not persist through even the slightest change of parts. This is a strict mereological essentialist view. If any part of an everyday or &#x27;vulgar&#x27; object is lost or gained over time, the object would cease to exist. (See Chisholm&#x27;s Stanford Encyclopedia entry for more about vulgar objects). The object from before is now a new and different one. Chisholm argues that these vulgar objects persist through time only in a philosophically loose sense. If we consider these objects carefully, they are better understood as merely feigning identity, what Chisholm calls &quot;ontological parasites&quot; or &quot;ens per alio.&quot; If we consider a table in which we change out individual parts each day for a week, we may at the end of the week say there has only been one table in front of us; however, this is only the loose way of talking. The single &#x27;table&#x27; we are referring to in that sentence is really only (Chisholm borrowing a phrase from Hume) a &#x27;succession of related objects.&#x27; The single &quot;table&quot; we refer to plays loose with identity. In a strict philosophical sense, if the table has had seven changes to its parts, there have been seven different tables. We may innocently discuss much of the world around us as persisting through change in the loose sense, but when we consider strict philosophical puzzles, we must not be fooled by ontological parasites.

Chisholm considers this theory with the famous philosophical puzzle of The Ship of Theseus. According to mereological essentialism, once a single plank of the ship is removed, the ship has become a different object. We may continue to talk about the Ship of Theseus as if it persisted, but this would only be in the loose sense discussed above. Chisholm solves the puzzle by saying that, in the strict and philosophical sense, there is no persistence between the mereologically different objects. Note the possible implication for the &quot;reconstructed ship&quot; that is often a part of the thought experiment. If every single part of the original ship were saved perfectly, so that they were materially identical, and rebuilt next to the new ship, Chisholm&#x27;s mereological essentialism may lead him to agree that this is &quot;the&quot; original Ship of Theseus.

However, Chisholm&#x27;s mereological essentialism does not extend to persons. Persons, unlike everyday vulgar material objects like ships and tables, persist in the strict and philosophical sense, even when they change their parts. This runs counter to his mereological essentialism in vulgar objects. He provides various arguments for why there is such a dividing line between the two and why persons are special. One argument is from the first hand experience of the unity of consciousness. He argues that these evidences, first person reporting and consciousness, are strong and should be innocent until proven guilty. He offers thought experiments as evidence including the surgery example and the use of Leibniz&#x27;s Law (Identity of indiscernibles).

The surgery thought experiment (attributed to Charles Sanders Peirce) runs like this. Imagine you could save a substantial amount of money by undergoing surgery without an anesthesia. Instead, you will be given drugs afterwards that cause amnesia of the whole experience. You ask your friends and family what to do and they encourage you to skip the anesthesia and save the money. They have come up with a solution to help you avoid the pain of undergoing the surgery fully aware: &quot;Have no fear,” they will say. “Take the cheaper operation and we will take care of everything. We will lay down the convention that the man on the table is not you, Jones, but is Smith.” What &quot;ought&quot; to be obvious to you, it seems to me, is that the laying down of this convention should have no effect at all upon your decision. For you may still ask, “But won’t that person be I?” and, it seems to me, the question has an answer. Chisholm&#x27;s point is that our identity and persistence as person is not like the mere convention of the loose persistence of vulgar objects. Regardless of the convention, you will still experience the pain of the surgery. This is meant to strengthen his position that person&#x27;s have strict philosophical persistence and are &quot;ens per se&quot; and not merely &quot;ens per alio.&quot; Persons are entities in themselves; vulgar objects are merely entities through another, or by entities by mere convention. Hence, if this thought experiment provides the intuition that we are not mere conventions, then mereological essentialism must be false for persons.

A second thought experiment is modal. It asks whether I, as a person, can persist with my identity through the loss of a hand. The answer according to first person reporting and the experience of consciousness is yes. If I have survived the loss of my hand (a mereological part) then mereological essentialism cannot hold for persons. This applies to Leibniz&#x27;s Law in the following way. If my body were identical to its collection of parts then the collection of parts could not survive the loss of my hand. Leibniz&#x27;s Law therefore implies that either I must not merely be the collection of parts that was my body or I am no longer myself. The evidence of consciousness rules out the latter; therefore, mereological essentialism must be false for persons. If mereological essentialism held for persons, then I would have been annihilated along with my hand.

<doc id="408331" wikidata="Q457883" url="?curid=408331" title="Ikue Mori">
<text>(born 17 December 1953), also known as Ikue Ile, is a drummer, electronic musician, composer, and graphic designer. Mori was awarded a &quot;Genius grant&quot; from the MacArthur Foundation in 2022.

==Biography==
Ikue Mori was born and raised in Japan. She says she had little interest in music before hearing punk rock. In 1977, she went to New York City, initially for a visit, but she became involved in the music scene, and has remained in New York since.

Her first musical experience was as the drummer for seminal no wave band DNA, which also featured East Village musician Arto Lindsay. Though she had little prior musical experience (and had never played drums), Mori quickly developed a distinctive style: One critic describes her as &quot;a tight, tireless master of shifting asymmetrical rhythm&quot;, while Lester Bangs wrote that she &quot;cuts Sunny Murray in my book.&quot;

After DNA disbanded, Mori became active in the New York experimental music scene. She abandoned her drum set, and began playing drum machines, which she sometimes modified to play various samples. According to Mori, she was trying to make the drum machines &quot;sound broken.&quot; Critic Adam Strohm writes that she &quot;founded a new world for the instrument, taking it far beyond backing rhythms and robotic fills.&quot; In recent years she has used a laptop as her primary instrument, but is still sometimes credited with &quot;electronic percussion&quot;.

In 1995, she began collaborating with Japanese bass guitarist Kato Hideki (from Ground Zero), and together with experimental guitarist Fred Frith (from Henry Cow), they formed Death Ambient. The trio released three albums, &quot;Death Ambient&quot; (1995), &quot;Synaesthesia&quot; (1999) and &quot;Drunken Forest&quot; (2007).

Beyond her solo recordings, she has recorded or performed with Dave Douglas, Butch Morris, Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, and many others, including as Hemophiliac, a trio with John Zorn and singer Mike Patton, as well as being a member of Zorn&#x27;s Electric Masada. With Zeena Parkins, she records and tours as duo project Phantom Orchard. She often records on Tzadik, as well as designing the covers for many of their albums.

Mori has drawn inspiration from visual arts. Her 2000 release, &quot;One Hundred Aspects of the Moon&quot; was inspired by famed Japanese artist Yoshitoshi. Her 2005 recording, &quot;Myrninerest&quot;, is inspired by outsider artist Madge Gill.

==Awards==
Mori received a 2005-2006 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. In 2022 Mori received the MacArthur Fellowship award (&quot;Genius Grant&quot;).

<doc id="408332" wikidata="Q1787489" url="?curid=408332" title="Tongue River (Montana)">
<text>The Tongue River is a tributary of the Yellowstone River, approximately 265 mi (426 km) long, in the U.S. states of Wyoming and Montana. The Tongue rises in Wyoming in the Big Horn Mountains, flows generally northeast through northern Wyoming and southeastern Montana, and empties into the Yellowstone River at Miles City, Montana. Most of the course of the river is through the beautiful and varied landscapes of eastern Montana, including the Tongue River Canyon, the Tongue River breaks, the pine hills of southern Montana, and the buttes and grasslands that were formerly the home of vast migratory herds of American bison.

The Tongue River watershed encompasses parts of the Cheyenne and Crow Reservations in Montana. The headwaters lie on the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming, and the watershed encompasses the Ashland Ranger District of the Custer National Forest. The river&#x27;s name corresponds to Cheyenne &quot;/vetanoveo&#x27;he/&quot;, where &quot;/vetanove/&quot; means &quot;tongue&quot; and &quot;/o&#x27;he&#x27;e/&quot; means &quot;river&quot;.

==Geography==

The Tongue River is fed by winter snowpack from the higher elevations of the Big Horn Mountains, early snow runoff of the lower elevations in the drainage basin, and ground water from springs in the drainage basin. The river level rises in March and April due to snowmelt in the lower elevations, and again in June as summer weather melts the higher-elevation snowpack. The flow of water in the upper river during the summer is generally steady, but in the later months of a dry summer, irrigation can reduce the lower river to a few pools of water connected by a small trickle. The river is generally frozen during the winter months.

The source of the Tongue River is in the highlands of the Big Horn Mountains in north-central Wyoming. The river descends the eastern side of the mountains and emerges from a canyon near Dayton, Wyoming. The river then flows eastward, past Ranchester, Wyoming, and merges with Goose Creek, after which the Tongue turns to flow northeast into Montana, where it is dammed, forming the Tongue River Reservoir. Continuing northeast from the reservoir, the river flows through a prairie canyon and the Tongue River breaks, passing Birney, Montana.

The river forms the eastern boundary of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation from about north of the reservoir to a point north of Ashland, Montana, after which the river continues to flow in a broad valley to its mouth on the Yellowstone River near Miles City, Montana. The Tongue River Valley near Decker, Montana also contains the southeast corner of the large Crow Indian Reservation.

The Tongue River headwaters are on the Bighorn National Forest. On forested buttes lying between the Tongue River and Pumpkin Creek is the Ashland Ranger District of the Custer National Forest, which has three separate ranger districts, the other two being the Beartooth Ranger District located in the area of the Beartooth uplift, and the Sioux Ranger District located in the southeast corner of Montana and the northwest corner of South Dakota.

The term &quot;Tongue River Canyon&quot; can refer to either the river&#x27;s mountain canyon in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, or the river&#x27;s prairie canyon in Montana, located downstream from the Tongue River Dam and Reservoir.

The major tributaries of the Tongue are Pumpkin Creek, Otter Creek, Hanging Woman Creek, Prairie Dog Creek and Goose Creek. All of these tributaries enter on the eastern side of the river, and all flow in a northerly direction.

Pumpkin Creek meets the Tongue about above the mouth of the river, and extends for into the Custer National Forest; the small community of Sonnette, Montana is at the headwaters. Otter Creek enters the Tongue River near Ashland, Montana, about upstream of the mouth of the river, and its headwaters are near the Wyoming–Montana state line about to the south. Hanging Woman Creek empties into the Tongue at Birney, Montana, about above the mouth of the Tongue, and its headwaters are away in northern Wyoming. Prairie Dog Creek and Goose Creek flow into the Tongue at the point where the Tongue turns from an eastward direction to flow toward the northeast. Goose Creek drains a scenic, well-watered basin in Wyoming, on the eastern edge of the Big Horn Mountains, where Sheridan and Big Horn, Wyoming are located.

The drainage basin to the west is the Rosebud Creek basin. The drainage basin to the east is the Powder River basin. Both rivers, like the Tongue, flow in a northerly direction into the Yellowstone River.

The Tongue and its tributaries flow through parts of Custer, Powder River, Rosebud and Big Horn counties in Montana, and Sheridan County in Wyoming.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, the Tongue River has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==Geology==
The Tongue River basin is part of the larger geologic structure known as the Powder River basin. The term &quot;Powder River basin&quot; can refer to the topographic drainage basin lying to the east of the Tongue River drainage basin, but the term is used in this part to denote the larger geological structure which stretches from the Black Hills to the Big Horn Mountains and which includes the Tongue River drainage area.

The Powder River basin is shaped like a large shallow bowl, with its westernmost rock formations lying against the Big Horn Mountains. As these mountains uplifted over eons of geologic time they lifted and tilted the sedimentary rocks from the Powder River basin, which were then eroded away, creating the plains that stretch eastward from the mountains into the basin. Generally there are older sedimentary layers closer to the mountains and younger layers farther away.

As the Tongue flows out from the Big Horn Mountains it passes over the uplifted layers of increasingly younger sedimentary rocks. In the Big Horn Mountains the Tongue flows in its mountain canyon of Madison Limestone, which was deposited during Early to Middle Mississippian time, about 359 to 326 million years ago. As the Tongue leaves the mountains it flows through younger formations, including the distinctive thick red Chugwater Formation, deposited during the Triassic time, 250 to 199 million years ago. Shortly after leaving the mountains, the Tongue River enters an area dominated by a thick layer of buff-colored sandstones and silty clay. This sedimentary layer is named the Tongue River Sandstone, because its outcrops are so predominant in the Tongue River basin. The Tongue River Sandstone is the youngest of three &quot;members&quot; which form the Fort Union Formation, the other two members being the Lebo Shale Member and the Tullock Member.

The buff-colored sandstones and shales of the Tongue River sandstone are visible all along the greater part of the Tongue River from Dayton, Wyoming to a point north of Ashland, Montana.
In this stretch, the sandstone layers of the Tongue River member hold ground water so that the highlands on each side of the Tongue River valley are often covered with pines. As the river approaches Miles City the valley changes appearance to grassy rolling hills, as the river leaves the Tongue River formation and flows through the Lebo shale and the Tullock sedimentary formations.

The Tongue River sandstone member outcrops widely over portions of southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming and it is best known for its coal. The Tongue River member has approximately 32 coal seams with a combined thickness in excess of 300 ft. The thickness of the separate coal seams varies radically from place to place—in some places the beds are thick but over a relatively short distance the seam can pinch out to nothing. Where these coal beds are thick and also close to the surface in the Powder River Basin in northern Wyoming and southern Montana they are mined in large open pit mines, like the mines along the Tongue in the vicinity of Decker, Montana. Tongue River coal is low in sulfur content and coal-fired electric generating places throughout the United States demand Tongue River coal so they can meet federal emission standards. Because of this demand, about 40% of the coal now used to generate electricity in the United States is mined from the Tongue River sandstone coal seams in the Powder River Basin, producing 14% of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.

Where the Tongue River now flows in Montana and Wyoming, the sedimentary rock formation that is today known as the Tongue River sandstone began to form about 60 million years ago, when mountain uplifts began rising from a shallow sea. The Black Hills uplift on the east, the Hartville uplift on the southeast, and the Big Horn Block on the west created a flat, swampy low-lying plain, with slow moving rivers flowing northwest to deltas along a shallow sea. At this time the climate in the area was subtropical, averaging approximately of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the floor of this plain was made up of thick deposits of sandy silt from the surrounding mountains, with many rivers, deltas, backwaters and swamps, all covered by forests and vegetation. At that time, from 35 to 60 million years ago, the area where the Tongue River now flows would have appeared as a dense swampy jungle. Over long periods of time, the heavy plant growth died and accumulated as peaty layers in the large backwaters and swamps all across the basin. Periodically more sandy silt deposits would wash in from the mountains, completely burying the layers of organic peaty materials. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The area passed through more long periods of geologic time, during which new sedimentary layers buried this entire sandy silty layer along with its deposits of peat, under thousands of feet of newer sediments, compressing the sandy silty deposits into the Tongue River sandstone of today, and also compressing and changing the layers of peaty organic material into thinner layers of lignite coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, bringing the sandstone layer with its seams of coal to the surface again in the Tongue River area.

The Tongue River sandstone forms cliffs, hills, buttes and bluffs along the river and throughout the basin. From the Decker area downstream to about Birney the river flows through the prairie in a canyon carved from the Tongue River sandstone. The upper part of this canyon is dammed to form the Tongue River Reservoir.

The sandstone hillsides and bluffs along the Tongue and its tributaries often have reddish bands running through them or they are capped with resistant reddish layer. These red layers were formed millions of years ago. Coal seams outcropping in the Tongue River sandstone caught fire, probably from prairie fires that started by lightning. The fires burned from the outcropo back into the coal seams, and the fire finally went out when they burned so deeply into the coal seam that the fire was smothered. These fires burned for a long time and they were extremely hot, and they baked and changed the structure of the sedimentary rocks that lay just over the coal seam until it became a hard &quot;clinker&quot; substance and turned a reddish brick color. These red &quot;clinker&quot; beds are often more resistant to erosion than the silty sandstone, so they appear on the higher parts of bluffs, and buttes on either side of the valleys of the Tongue River basin are often capped by beds of this baked and fused rock that are five to twenty feet thick. Besides the beds of reddish &quot;clinker&quot; larger concretions can be found that appear at first glance to be similar to melted glass or even pieces of volcanic rock. Although of a different appearance than the clinker these odd-looking concretions are also formed by the burning coal beds, with the difference in appearance being due to the difference in content of the material in the overlying bed that was heated to very high temperatures. The reddish &quot;clinker&quot; is crushed and used to surface roads throughout the Tongue River basin.

North of the Yellowstone, dinosaur fossils have been found in Cretaceous era rock formations, but dinosaur fossils have not been found in any members of the Paleozoic Fort Union Formation, including the Tongue River sandstone. However plant fossils are common in the Tongue River sandstone, and many imprints of leaves and fronds have been found and collected by scientists and fossil hunters.

==History==

===Early history===
In about 1450, Crow leader No Intestines received a vision and separated from the ancestral tribe, which remained along the Missouri River as sedentary farmers known as Hidatsa. No Intestines led his band on a long migratory search for sacred tobacco, finally settling in southeastern Montana, where they became known as the Many Lodges or Mountain Crow. By 1490, the Crow were firmly established in a homeland that included the Tongue River valley–in south central/southeastern Montana, and northern Wyoming. To acquire control of this area, the Crow warred against Shoshone bands, and drove them westward, but allied themselves with local Kiowa and Kiowa Apache bands.

The Crow were a Northern high plains, nomadic, bison hunting culture based on the dog travois but in about 1700 they acquired horses and swiftly evolved a horse based nomadic hunting culture. The Kiowa bands migrated southward, and the Crow remained dominant in an extensive area, including the Tongue River, in south central Montana through the 18th century, 19th century and the era of the fur trade.

The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 confirmed a large area centered on the Big Horn Mountains as Crow lands—the area ran from the Big Horn Basin on the west, to the Musselshell River on the north, and east to the Powder River, and included the Tongue River basin. However, for two centuries, the Cheyenne and the many bands of Lakota people had been steadily migrating westward into the plains, and by 1851 they were established just to the south and east of Crow territory in Montana. The Lakota along with their Cheyenne allies coveted the fine hunting lands where the Crow lived and after 1851 the Lakota and Cheyenne fought the Crow and took control of their eastern hunting lands, including the Powder and Tongue River valleys, pushing the less numerous Crow to the west and northwest along the Yellowstone River.

After about 1860 the Lakota claimed all the lands lying east of the Big Horn Mountains and required the whites to deal with them regarding any intrusion into these areas. Red Cloud&#x27;s War (1866 to 1868) was a challenge by the Lakota to the military presence on the Bozeman Trail, which went to the Montana gold fields along the eastern edge of the Big Horn Mountains. Red Cloud&#x27;s War ended in a complete victory for the Lakota, and the 1868 Treaty of Ft. Laramie confirmed their control over all the high plains from the crest of the Big Horn Mountains eastward across the Powder River Basin to the Black Hills. Thereafter bands of Lakota led by Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and others, along with their Northern Cheyenne allies, hunted and raided throughout the length and breadth of eastern Montana and northeastern Wyoming, including the area of the Tongue River Valley, until the Great Sioux War of 1876–1877. Although early in the war on June 25, 1876 the Lakota and Cheyenne enjoyed a major victory over army forces under General George A. Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the Great Sioux War ended in the defeat of the Sioux and their Cheyenne allies, and their exodus from eastern Montana and Wyoming, either in flight to Canada or by forced removal to distant reservations.

In 1877, the Northern Cheyenne, allied with the Lakota, were ordered south to a reservation in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) with the related but separate Southern Cheyenne tribes. Plagued with disease and malnutrition, in 1878 a group of 279 Northern Cheyenne made a desperate attempt to return to the northern plains. After a running battle from Indian Territory to Montana, the battered remnants of this group arrived at Ft. Keogh, at the mouth of the Tongue, where a Northern Cheyenne band under Two Moons remained which had yet not been sent south. General Miles allowed Ft. Keogh to become a gathering point for the scattered Northern Cheyenne people. Over time Cheyenne families began to migrate south from the fort and establish homesteads up the Tongue River and on the Rosebud. By executive orders in 1884 and 1900, the federal government carved out a reservation for the Northern Cheyenne on Rosebud Creek, with the Tongue River as its eastern boundary.

===Fur trading era===
In September 1833 on the Tongue River, a chapter was written in the rivalry between the Rocky Mountain Fur Company (RMF) and the American Fur Company (AFC). Tom Fitzpatrick, a mountain man and fur trader with the RMF, rode to Crow camps on Tongue River with a band of about 30 other trappers to trade for furs and to ask permission of the chiefs to make his fall hunt in their country. The Crows invited Tom to camp with them. He cautiously declined and pitched his camp three miles off. Then he rode over with a few men to visit the chief, who received and entertained him cordially. The AFC was a rival of Tom Fitzpatrick&#x27;s RMF Company and they had agents in the Crow villages including the notorious James Beckwourth, who was an adopted member of the tribe. While Fitzpatrick was visiting the Crow camp, young Crow warriors, probably instigated by AFC agents, rode to Fitzpatrick&#x27;s camp and proceeded to steal all of his horses, rifles, traps, and equipment, as well as his beaver pelts and trade goods. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s camp was being guarded by 25 of his men under Captain William Drummond Stewart, a former British officer (and veteran of Waterloo) and no pushover. Upon entering the trappers camp, the collection of Crow warriors probably first affected an excessive cordiality and when their demonstrations of friendship and claims of affection had literally and figuratively disarmed the trappers, &quot;then the knives, clubs, bows and guns were out, and a Crow was attached to everything of value.&quot; The warriors even took Capt. Stewart&#x27;s watch. Upon meeting Tom Fitzpatrick as he returned from the village, the young warriors completed their work by robbing him of his coat. The next day, Fitzpatrick, always a realist, returned to the Crow camp and begged his former friend, the Crow Chief for help and received back some of his horses, rifles, traps and other equipment, and a small amount of ammunition per man, but no furs or trade goods.

In 1835 Samuel Tullock of the American Fur Company (AFC) built Fort Van Buren on the right bank of the Yellowstone. Although the precise location of this fort is in dispute, it was located along the Yellowstone River, in an area near the mouth of the Tongue River. At the fort, AFC agents traded for furs with Indians from the surrounding area. The fort was abandoned in 1842, and later burned.

===Indian wars===

====Bozeman Trail and Red Cloud&#x27;s War====
In 1864, the Bozeman Trail was opened to the Montana gold fields. A portion of the trail entered the Tongue River Basin at Prairie Dog Creek and crossed over to Goose Creek and went on to the Tongue River beyond present day Ranchester, Wyoming then up the Tongue River to the Pass Creek divide. After the Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado in November 1864, depredations by Cheyenne, Arapahoe and Sioux increased along the Oregon Trail and the Bozeman Trail, which was then closed to civilian traffic. The army launched a punitive campaign, and Brigadier General Patrick Edward Connor led a column up the Bozeman Trail. On August 29, 1865, General Conner, with a force variously estimated at about 300 soldiers, surprised an Arapahoe village of about 500 to 700 under Chiefs Old David and Black Bear camped on the Bozeman Trail, on the south side of the Tongue near present-day Ranchester, Wyoming. In what is now known as the Battle of the Tongue River the soldiers charged into the Indian camp firing indiscriminately, surprising the Indians who were breaking camp. The Indians first fled up Wolf Creek, but then regrouped and counter-attacked. The soldiers destroyed about 250 lodges, then retreated down the Tongue River Valley driving from 700 to 1000 captured horses, repulsing attacks of Arapahoe warriors seeking to get back some of their horses.

Two days after the battle with Conner, on August 31, 1865, warriors from the same Arapahoe village attacked a large wagon train of road-builders led by &quot;Colonel&quot; James A. Sawyers, who were traveling on the Bozeman Trail, improving it as they went. The wagon train was besieged for 13 days at the Bozeman Trail ford on the Tongue River about halfway between Ranchester, Wyoming and Dayton, Wyoming. As the siege dragged on and a number of men were killed, Sawyers faced mutiny from his employees. Sawyers had started to retreat down the trail, when he met a contingent of army cavalry moving up the trail, who agreed to escort them to the Big Horn River, after which the wagon train proceeded on to the Montana gold fields.

In 1866, the army determined to erect a series of forts along the Bozeman Trail. The scout Jim Bridger recommended a fort site in the Tongue River Valley, near Ranchester, Wyoming. Col. Henry B. Carrington rejected the Tongue River site for a site to the south on Little Piney Creek, in the Powder River drainage, where Fort Phil Kearny was erected.

From 1865 through 1868 during Red Cloud&#x27;s War, Cheyenne and Lakota Sioux bands harassed, attacked and killed travelers on the Bozeman Trail and soldiers at Fort Phil Kearny and Fort C. F. Smith. These bands often located their base camps on the Tongue River because they could camp far enough down the river from the forts to be secure from counterattack, and the lower Tongue River Valley afforded a wide variety of camp sites with the three necessities of the nomadic Indians – wood for fires, abundant water, and adequate grass for grazing their large horse herds.

====1873 Yellowstone Expedition (1873 Northern Pacific railroad survey)====
Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer, with Companies A and B of the Seventh Cavalry, engaged and held off a larger Sioux force, including Hunkpapas, Oglalas, Miniconjous and Cheyennes at the Battle of Honsinger Bluff on August 4, 1873 about above the mouth of the Tongue on the Yellowstone River. Custer&#x27;s command was part of the Stanley military column which was accompanying and protecting Northern Pacific Railroad survey parties in the summer months of 1873. Many of the Indian leaders and army officers who participated in the Battle of Honsinger Bluff were present at the more famous Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876, three years later.

====Great Sioux War of 1876–77====
In a June 9, 1876 engagement called the Skirmish at Tongue River Heights, during the Great Sioux War of 1876-77 General George Crook was camped on the Tongue near the mouth of Prairie Dog Creek with about 950 soldiers, when Sioux fired into his camp from a bluff across the Tongue. A battalion under Captain Anson Mills responded, crossing the river and driving the Sioux force from the bluffs. As a consequence of this engagement, on June 11, General Crook moved his base camp to the junction of Big and Little Goose Creeks, some 7 miles south of the junction of Goose Creek and the Tongue River, where Sheridan, Wyoming is now located. On June 16, after being joined on the Tongue by some 260 Crow and Shoshone scouts, Crook moved his forces north, across the Tongue, and on June 17, 1876 engaged a large Sioux and Cheyenne force at the Battle of the Rosebud. After the battle Crook returned south of the Tongue River to the base camp on Goose Creek, and he was still there on June 25, 1876 when General George A. Custer was defeated at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, some 65 miles to the north.

After remaining idle for more than two weeks on Goose Creek, on July 6, 1876 General George Crook ordered Second Lieutenant Frederick W. Sibley to take 25 men and two scouts, Big Bat Pourier and Frank Grouard, and make a reconnaissance to the north to locate the hostile Indian forces. While traveling up the Tongue River in the vicinity of (present day) Dayton, Wyoming, the patrol discovered a large party of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors moving south and very close to them. The only chance was to turn aside and take a trail near Dayton that led up into the adjacent Big Horn Mountains. The war party followed closely, and after surviving attacks by pursuing Indians, the patrol abandoned their horses and traveled deep into the rough steep terraine of the Tongue River Canyon system on foot. Over several days the group was able to evade the Indian force, after which they walked over thirty miles out of the mountains and back to the Goose Creek camp, arriving worn out and fatigued but with no casualties. The &quot;Sibley Scout&quot; became another incident of the Great Sioux War of 1876 that took place along the Tongue River.

In the fall of 1876 following the defeat of Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the army determined to garrison the area, and Colonel Nelson A. Miles and elements of infantry units constructed the Tongue River Cantonment at the mouth of the Tongue River. A community formed nearby named &quot;Milestown&quot; after Col. Miles who banished the settlement to a point three miles away from the cantonment. In the following year, after a vigorous winter campaign, the army increased the commitment of forces and Col. Miles constructed Fort Keogh about west of the Tongue. After the fort was finished, Miles permitted civilians to settle on the eastern bank of the Tongue. Immediately, Milestown moved west forming Miles City. Today, the Tongue joins with the Yellowstone within the city limits of Miles City.

On December 16, 1876 five Sioux chiefs from Crazy Horse&#x27;s village approached the Tongue River Cantonment to discuss terms of surrender for their bands. The Sioux were the hereditary enemies of the Crow, and the five Sioux were suddenly attacked and killed by some of the army&#x27;s Crow scouts. The attack occurred within sight of the Cantonment, but was so swift and unexpected that the army could not intervene to save the chiefs. The Crow scouts involved immediately fled from the area. This episode delayed surrender of Sioux and Cheyenne bands, and extended the Great Sioux War of 1876–1877.

On January 8, 1877 Colonel Miles and infantry units engaged in one of the last battles of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77 near Birney, Montana in the Tongue River Valley. Colonel Miles, leading elements of the 5th and 22nd infantry, avoided an ambush by Oglala Sioux under Crazy Horse, and segments of Cheyenne under White Bull and Two Moons, and then engaged the Indian forces driving them back up the Tongue River. The battle is officially referred to as the Battle of the Wolf Mountains, although this is a misnomer. The battle is also referred to by various other names, including the Battle of Pyramid Butte, the Battle of the Butte, and Miles Battle on the Tongue River. The Wolf Mountains are actually several drainages to the west from the battle site, but General Miles&#x27; report stated the battle was in the Wolf Mountains, and that name has stuck. The battle site is about 4.5 road miles west of the town of Birney, on the Tongue River road.

==Lumber==
A sawmill operates at Ashland, cutting timber which is harvested from the broken highlands, between the stream valleys in the surrounding area.

==Agriculture and irrigation==
The Tongue River basin is prime livestock country. Limited farm lands that exist along flowing streams in the basin are usually irrigated from diversion dams, and produce crops which support the livestock industry—hay and feed stocks (corn, barley, alfalfa). Dry land wheat farming, which is prevalent elsewhere in eastern Montana, occurs only in limited and scattered acreages in the Tongue River basin. Cattle represent the great bulk of the total livestock production from the Tongue River basin with sheep a distant second.

Cattle ranches in the Tongue River Basin are predominantly &quot;cow calf&quot; instead of &quot;yearling&quot; operations. The yearly cycle of a &quot;cow calf&quot; operation begins with the birth of calves from February to May. At spring roundup the calves are branded. Bulls are put with the cows to start the nine-month gestation cycle to produce next year&#x27;s calf crop on the month chosen by the rancher, after which the bulls are again separated from the herds. The herds are moved to summer pasture, and in June and July attention focuses on cutting and storing hay for the next winter. Feed crops are harvested in late summer or fall. The late fall roundup separates the calves which are sold to cattle buyers and shipped by truck. The herd is moved to the pasture where they will be fed for the winter, and in about the first week of December enough snow accumulates to start the process of feeding hay to carry the herd through the winter. Ranch chores, repairs and maintenance, work on building projects, doctoring cattle and the like go on all year round.

One of the oldest irrigation projects on the Tongue River is the T&amp;Y Ditch, which dates from 1886. The diversion dam from the T&amp;Y ditch was recently altered to include a fish ladder, which now allows fish from the Tongue and Yellowstone Rivers below the dam to migrate upriver, for the first time in 125 years.

==Coal deposits and coal mines==
Historically, underground coal mines existed along the Tongue River at the communities of Monarch, Kleenburn and Acme, about 7 to 10 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming. These mines were based on seams of coal that outcropped in this area, in the Tongue River valley or on small tributaries off the valley. The CB&amp;Q railroad ran from Sheridan, Wyoming past these mines and on to Billings, Montana, allowing for easy shipment of coal. These underground mines were economically operated from about 1900 to the late 1940s. Miners lived in these communities or in Sheridan, Wyoming. Miners in Sheridan commuted the 7 to 10 miles to reach the mines by trolly.

The same coal seams that used to be mined by tunnels are now accessed for mining by large open surface excavations. Several large coal strip mines are presently operating in the area around the Tongue River Reservoir, near the small town of Decker, Montana about 20 to 23 miles northeast from Sheridan, Wyoming. These mines are operated by the Kiewit Corporation and produce subbituminous low sulfur Powder River basin coal. There are no electrical generating facilities at this site. A rail spur line extends to the mine sites from the BNSF main line near Sheridan, Wyoming allows this coal to be shipped by rail to coal-fired electric generating plants all over the United States.

Large undeveloped private and federally owned coal deposits are located along Otter Creek, a tributary of the Tongue River. These coal deposits are located south of Ashland, which is at the junction of the Tongue River and Otter Creek. These coal deposits are sufficiently thick, and are located under sufficiently thin overburden, as to be economically viable. Drawbacks for production are the lack of a rail spur to transport the coal, and the lack of an established community of sufficient size in the area to support the work force needed to develop the coal mines. A railroad spur line, if built, would have to come up the Tongue River from Miles City, a distance of some 65 to 70 miles. Extensive infrastructure improvements would have to be added to the community of Ashland before it could support the number of worker&#x27;s families that the mine would draw to the area. These deposits on Otter Creek are the source of much debate over the future of energy development in southeastern Montana. Arch Coal has submitted an application to develop a coal mine in the area, but it has not, as of 2015, been approved by state regulators. The Tongue River Railroad project, planned to move coal from the mine to Colstrip, is also in the permitting stage.

Undeveloped but extensive coal deposits exist along Youngs Creek and adjacent creeks, which flow into the Tongue River just upstream from the Tongue River Reservoir. This large and (as yet) untapped deposit of coal is just a few miles south of the large open pit coal mines already being operated by Kiewit. The upper 15 miles of Youngs Creek lies on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana, and the Crow Tribe owns the coal beds underlying this portion of the creek. The last 3 miles of the creek lie between the reservation boundary and the Tongue River, in Wyoming. As to the coal beds on the Crow reservation, the Secretary of the Interior approved a coal lease negotiated by the Crow Tribe with Shell Oil Company in 1983 to develop this coal resource. The lease had extensive long term benefits for the Crow tribe, and required payments to the tribe to start at a future point of time even in the event the coal was not mined. Shell paid the tribe a bonus to cancel this lease in 1985, because of poor market conditions, and because of Shell&#x27;s uncertainties on how Montana&#x27;s severance tax would be applied to coal owned by the Crow Tribe. Compared to Otter Creek these coal resources are easier to develop—the coal resources of Young&#x27;s creek lies within five to ten miles of the railroad spur line which is used to ship coal from the nearby open pit mines being operated by Kiewit in the Decker, Montana area, and the communities of Sheridan and Ranchester already exist to serve as a base for the work force needed to develop coal mines at Youngs Creek.

==Transportation and access==

===Roads and travel conditions===
I-94, an east–west interstate artery carrying U.S. Highway 12, crosses the Tongue at its mouth at Miles City. I-90, also an east–west interstate artery carrying U.S. Highway 87 and U.S. Highway 14, crosses the upper reaches of the Tongue between Ranchester and Dayton, and continues to Sheridan. U.S. Highway 212 extends east and west from Ashland bisecting the middle of the Tongue River basin from side to side.

The Tongue River has a road running along almost all of its length, as do the major tributaries, but the predominance of gravel roads over paved roads is a testament to the remoteness of the region. In the Tongue River valley, starting from Miles City and going up the river there are about 30 miles of pavement to the community of Garland, then 35 miles of gravel, followed by about 7 miles of paved road into Ashland, where U.S. Highway 212 is encountered. South of Ashland, continuing up the valley, there is another 20 miles of paved road, then another 38 miles of gravel roads to the pavement above the Tongue River Reservoir, followed by 10 miles of pavement to the Montana/Wyoming state line. In Wyoming a network of paved roads follow the Tongue river westward to Ranchester and Dayton, where the Tongue comes out of the Big Horn Mountains. A road from Dayton goes up the Tongue for a short distance into the mountains, after which contact with the Tongue River and its mountain branches is by hiking trail.

The lower major tributaries of the Tongue (Pumpkin Creek, Ottor Creek, Hanging Woman Creek, Prairie Dog Creek) all have gravel roads branching off the Tongue River Road and running along their length, providing access to local ranches. In Wyoming, the major tributary is Goose Creek, which flows out of a basin with Sheridan, Wyoming at its center, and so this entire basin area has well-developed paved and gravel roads. In addition to the roads that run along the Tongue and its major tributaries, there is a network of gravel roads that cross the highlands between the stream valleys.

During the winter, travel along the roads in the basin can become difficult to impossible depending on snow accumulation, particularly on the more remote gravel roads that are not regularly plowed. If road conditions or car trouble strand a motorist in the more remote areas of the basin, during the pulses of intense winter cold common to this area, there is a real risk of death or injury by freezing. The Tongue River basin does not have the &quot;gumbo&quot; type mud that affects road travel in wet weather on the north side of the Yellowstone River. Traffic on the gravel and dirt roads of the Tongue River basin is a problem at sharp corners, blind hilltops, concealed entrances to side roads, and when suddenly encountering oversized slow ranch/farm vehicles. In warm weather it is a good idea to keep an eye out ahead for dust clouds indicating approaching vehicles. The motorist traveling in the Tongue River basin should keep a constant look out for livestock on the road, and especially for deer (particularly at dawn, dusk and at night).

There are good roadside services at Miles City, Montana at the mouth of the Tongue River basin, and also in the upper reaches of the basin at Dayton and Ranchester and in the vicinity of Sheridan, Wyoming. There are limited roadside services in Ashland, located about the center of the basin, where U.S. 212 goes east and west. For the rest of the Tongue River basin, the motorist is on his or her own.

===Railroads===
Since the settlement of Miles City, at the mouth of the Tongue, and the related settlement of Sheridan, Wyoming, located approximately 125 air miles to the south there has been much discussion of a north–south railroad connecting the cities and corridored along the Tongue River valley. This has been the subject of many promotional business ventures over the years.

From 1923 to 1935 the North and South Railway promoted a rail line south from Miles City, Montana through Sheridan to Casper, Wyoming. The northern segment was to run along the Tongue between Miles City, Montana and Sheridan, Wyoming. The southern segment was to run from Casper to Sheridan, Wyoming. Track was only laid on a portion of the southern segment. However, grading was done on the northern segment, and cuts and embankments can still be seen approximately 7 miles south of Miles City on the east side of the Tongue River. Financial problems caused the entire railroad project to be abandoned in 1935.

The current venture is the Tongue River Railroad, in various stages of planning for more than 30 years and intended to move coal from near Ashland to Colstrip.

The BNSF railroad operating between Sheridan, Wyoming and Billings, Montana runs along the Tongue for a distance of about 10 miles, starting from a point about 7 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming. Though this segment of rail line along the Tongue was limited, from 1900 to 1940 coal was shipped by the railroad from underground coal mines located in the Tongue River valley, along this stretch of track. This railroad was a part of the former Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy (CB&amp;Q, or &quot;Burlington&quot;) railroad system, which has now been merged in the present Burlington, Northern, Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad system.

The Northern Pacific Railroad built track to Miles City, crossing the Tongue River in 1881, about a mile from the junction of the Tongue and the Yellowstone. This construction was part of the mainline from St. Paul, Minnesota to the Pacific port of Tacoma, Washington completed in 1883, and it is still in operation today as part of the BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) railroad.

The Milwaukee Road (the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway) completed its mainline from the midwest to Puget Sound in 1909. This line also passed through Miles City and crossed the Tongue River between the existing NP tracks and the Yellowstone River. This line failed in the early 1980s and is no longer in use today.

==Wildlife and fisheries==
The Tongue River Valley, before it reaches the Big Horn Mountains, is part of an extensive drainage basin which is an environment in which wild game thrives. In this area of rolling prairies, sandstone outcrops and ponderosa pines, there are plentiful numbers of whitetail deer and mule deer, many of trophy quality. Antelope are found throughout this area. On the more southern tributaries, particularly in the Custer National Forest area, there are growing herds of prairie elk, an animal originally native to the plains of eastern Montana. Throughout the area are upland game birds, notably pheasant and grouse, and increasingly abundant flocks of wild turkeys.

The headwaters of the Tongue located in the Big Horn National Forest, in the Big Horn Mountains provide resources for deer, elk, bear and mountain lion hunting.

The grey wolf is an issue if not yet a reality in the Tongue River Basin, and there have been unconfirmed sightings of wolves in the more remote areas of the basin. Livestock, particularly sheep and calves, are vulnerable to wolves and, according to reports, livestock suffered significant depredations by wolves and coyotes in the last part of the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. This led to a war on these predators, with bounties paid by livestock associations and state agencies. By the mid-1930s wolves had been exterminated completely in the Tongue River basin (and indeed throughout the stockgrowing west). Times changed, and sympathy grew for the wolf, as well as his cousin the coyote. Since the release of wolves in Yellowstone Park in 1995, there has been increasing concern by stockgrowers in surrounding areas that wolf packs would migrate out of the park to cattle country and re-establish themselves where the pickings were better. In cattle and sheep country like the Tongue River basin, the debate about wolf reintroduction is ongoing and far from resolved.

The Tongue River Reservoir is popular among fishermen for a variety of fish. Very large catfish have been caught at the reservoir. In its upper reaches above the Tongue River Reservoir, and extending into the Big Horn Mountains, the Tongue River is fished for trout. Follow the footnote for six access points in Wyoming, five of them in the mountain section of the Tongue.

The Tongue is a Class I river from Tongue River Dam to its confluence with the Yellowstone River for public access and for recreational purposes.

==Literary references==
Otter Creek and Goose Creek, tributaries of the Tongue, are the location of Sam Morton&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;Where the Rivers Run North&quot;.

Ernest Hemingway wrote a short story, &quot;Wine of Wyoming&quot; that references coal miners living at Sheridan, Wyoming during the era of prohibition, who worked at the underground coal mines in the Tongue River valley, a few miles north of Sheridan. The story &quot;Wine of Wyoming&quot; was published in 1933 as part of a collection of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s short stories entitled &quot;Winner Take Nothing&quot;.

The Tongue River valley and surrounding area is the setting for &quot;A Bride Goes West&quot;, an autobiography of Nannie Alderson, which relates her life as a ranch wife in the late 19th century in south central Montana.

Edmund Randolph wrote a book &quot;Hell Among the Yearlings&quot; about his experiences living on a ranch on the Tongue River in the 1920s, and getting into the cattle business.

<text>Shahbanu (, ) was the title for empress regnant or empress consort in Persian and other Iranian languages. The two Sassanian empresses regnant, Boran and Azarmidokht, , were the last two that carried the title before Farah Pahlavi, the wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persia), assumed the title for the first time since the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century.

As an empress during Sassanid times, the principal Shahbanu was also titled &quot;banbishnan banbishn&quot; (&quot;Queen of Queens&quot;) analogous to the emperor&#x27;s title &quot;shahanshah&quot; (lit. &quot;King of Kings&quot;) to distinguish her from the other queens in the royal household.

Farah Pahlavi sometimes continues to be referred to as &quot;Shahbanu&quot;, as is customarily done internationally for titleholders associated with abolished monarchies, but the title is no longer valid in Iran. According to the Persian Constitution of 1906, Yasmine Pahlavi would currently hold this title.

<text>A borstal was a type of youth detention centre in the United Kingdom, several member states of the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland. In India, such a detention centre is known as a borstal school.

Borstals were run by HM Prison Service and were intended to reform young offenders. The word originated from the first such institution established in 1902 near the English village of Borstal in Kent, and is sometimes used loosely to apply to other kinds of youth institutions and reformatories, such as approved schools and youth detention centres. The court sentence was officially called &quot;borstal training&quot;. Borstals were originally for offenders under 21, but in the 1930s the maximum age was increased to 23. The Criminal Justice Act 1982 abolished the borstal system in the UK, replacing borstals with youth custody centres.

In India, borstal schools are used for the imprisonment of minors. As of 31 December 2014, there were twenty functioning borstal schools in India, with a combined total capacity of 2,108 inmates.

==History==

===United Kingdom===

The Gladstone Committee (1895) first proposed the concept of the borstal, wishing to separate youths from older convicts in adult prisons. It was the task of Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise (1857–1935), a prison commissioner, to introduce the system, and the first such institution was established at Borstal Prison in a village called Borstal, near Rochester, Kent, England, in 1902. Although originally created to be a typical prison, Borstal evolved into something new, with the name still recognised today. The redesigned prison regime focused on education rather than punishment, aiming to avoid inmates reoffending.

The system was developed on a national basis and formalised in the Prevention of Crime Act 1908. The regimen in these institutions was designed to be &quot;educational rather than punitive&quot;, but it was highly regulated, with a focus on routine, discipline and authority during the early years. Borstal institutions were originally designed to offer education, regular work and discipline, though one commentator has claimed that &quot;more often than not they were breeding grounds for bullies and psychopaths.&quot;

The Criminal Justice Act 1982 officially abolished the borstal system in the UK, introducing youth custody centres instead. As society had changed the system was then already outdated especially since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with many borstals being closed and replaced with institutions called Detention Centres and, from 1972, also with Community Service Order sentences.

====Corporal punishment====
Except in Northern Ireland, the only corporal punishment officially available in borstals was the birch for mutiny or assaulting an officer, and this could be imposed only by the visiting magistrates, subject in each case to the personal approval of the Home Secretary, just as in adult prisons. Only male inmates over 18 might be so punished. This power was very rarely used – there were only seven birching cases in borstals in the 10 years to 1936. This birching power was available only in England and Wales (not in Scottish borstals). Caning as a more day-to-day punishment was used in the single borstal in Northern Ireland but was not authorised in Scotland or England and Wales. Confusion on this matter arises perhaps because in approved schools, a quite different kind of youth institution based more on the open &quot;boarding school&quot; model, caning was an official punishment for young people (maximum age 19).

===Commonwealth===
A similar system under the name &quot;borstal&quot; or &quot;borstal school&quot; has also been introduced in several other Commonwealth countries.

==== India ====

In India, nine states, namely Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, have borstal schools in their respective jurisdictions. Tamil Nadu had the highest capacity, at 678 inmates (as of 2014). Himachal Pradesh and Kerala are the only states that have the capacity to lodge female inmates in two of their borstal schools. There are no borstal schools in any of the union territories.

===Ireland===

In Ireland the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 (Section 12) removed the term &quot;borstal&quot; from official use. This was part of a policy to broaden the system from reform and training institutions to a place of detention for youths between 17 and 21 for any sentence which carried a prison term. The only borstal in the state was based for most of its existence in Clonmel, in County Tipperary. Founded in 1906, it finally closed in 1956, when the remaining detainees were transferred to the newly established St. Patrick&#x27;s Institution in Dublin. Industrial schools performed a similar function to borstals.

<text>Malik (; ; ; variously Romanized &quot;Mallik&quot;, &quot;Melik&quot;, &quot;Malka&quot;, &quot;Malek&quot;, &quot;Maleek&quot;, &quot;Malick&quot;, &quot;Mallick&quot;, &quot;Melekh&quot;) is the Semitic term translating to &quot;king&quot;, recorded in East Semitic and Arabic, and as mlk in Northwest Semitic during the Late Bronze Age (e.g. Aramaic, Canaanite, Hebrew).

Although the early forms of the name were to be found among the pre-Arab and pre-Islamic Semitic speakers of the Levant, Canaan, and Mesopotamia, it has since been adopted in various other, mainly but not exclusively Islamized or Arabized non-Semitic Asian languages for their ruling princes and to render kings elsewhere.
It is also sometimes used in derived meanings.

The female version of Malik is Malikah (; or its various spellings such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;Melike&quot;), meaning &quot;queen&quot;.

The name Malik was originally found among various pre-Arab and non-Muslim Semitic speakers such as the indigenous ethnic Assyrians of Iraq, Amorites, Jews, Arameans, Mandeans, other Syriac speaking ethnic groups, and pre-Islamic Arabs. It has since been spread among various predominantly Muslim and non-Semitic peoples in Central Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia.

==Etymology==

The earliest form of the name &quot;Maloka&quot; was used to denote a prince or chieftain in the East Semitic Akkadian language of the Mesopotamian states of Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia and Chaldea. The Northwest Semitic &quot;mlk&quot; was the title of the rulers of the primarily Amorite, Sutean, Canaanite, Phoenician and Aramean city-states of the Levant and Canaan from the Late Bronze Age. Eventual derivatives include the Aramaic, Neo-Assyrian, Mandaic and Arabic forms: &quot;Malik&quot;, &quot;Malek&quot;, &quot;Mallick&quot;, &quot;Malkha&quot;, &quot;Malka&quot;, &quot;Malkai&quot; and the Hebrew form &quot;Melek&quot;.

&quot;Moloch&quot; has traditionally been interpreted as the epithet of a god, known as &quot;the king&quot; like Baal was an epithet &quot;the master&quot; and Adon an epithet &quot;the lord&quot;, but in the case of Moloch purposely mispronounced as &quot;Moleḵ&quot; instead of &quot;Meleḵ&quot; using the vowels of Hebrew &quot;bosheth&quot; &quot;shame&quot;.

==Political==

Primarily a &quot;malik&quot; is the ruling monarch of a kingdom, called &quot;mamlaka&quot;; that term is however also used in a broader sense, like realm, for rulers with another, generally lower titles, as in Sahib al-Mamlaka. Malik is also used for tribal leaders, e.g. among the Pashtuns.

Some Arab kingdoms are currently ruled by a Malik:
*Bahrain, formerly under a &quot;hakim&quot;, or &quot;ruler&quot;, until 16 August 1971, then under an &quot;emir&quot;, or &quot;prince&quot;, and since 14 February 2002 under a &quot;malik&quot;.
*Jordan, formerly the Emirate of Transjordan;
*Morocco, formerly a Sultanate;
*Saudi Arabia. On 10 June 1916, the Grand Sharif of Mecca assumed the title of King of the Hejaz; from 29 October 1916 &quot;King of the Arabs and Commander of the Faithful&quot;; from 6 November 1916 recognized by the allied powers only as King of the Hejaz, Commander of the Faithful, Grand Sharif and emir of Mecca; also assumed the title of Caliph on 11 March 1924; from 3 October 1924: King of the Hejaz and Grand Sharif of Mecca. In 1925 Nejd conquered Hijaz, so the Sultan of Nejd added the title &quot;King of Hijaz&quot;. On 22 September 1932 Nejd and Hejaz were renamed as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, full style: &quot;Malik al-Mamlaka al-&#x27;Arabiyya as-Sa&#x27;udiyya&quot; (&quot;King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&quot;); from 1986 prefixed to the name: &quot;Khadim al-Haramayn ash-Sharifayn&quot; (&quot;Servant (i.e. Protector) of the Two Exalted Holy Places [Mecca and Medina]&quot;).

Other historic realms under a Malik include:
*Egypt – the former khedivate and subsequently independent sultanate was ruled by &quot;Malik Misr&quot; (&quot;King of Egypt&quot;) from 1922 to 1951; and &quot;Malik Misr wa&#x27;s Sudan&quot; (&quot;King of Egypt and the Sudan&quot;) from 16 October 1951 until the proclamation of the republic on 18 June 1953
*Iraq – between 23 August 1921 and 2 May 1958, Iraq was ruled by a Hashemite &quot;Malik al-&#x27;Iraq&quot; (&quot;King of Iraq&quot;). Among the indigenous Assyrians and Kurdish Jews, the term has been (and still is) used since pre-Arab and pre-Islamic times for the title of tribal chief, for example Malik Khoshaba of the Bit-Tyareh tribe.
*Libya – Idris I (1890–1983) (Sayyid Muhammad Idris as-Sanusi, heir of a Muslim sect&#x27;s dynasty) reigned as &quot;Malik al-Mamlaka al-Libiyya al-Muttahida&quot; (&quot;King of the United Libyan Kingdom&quot;) from 24 December 1951 through 25 April 1963 and &quot;Malik al-Mamlaka al-Libiyya&quot; (&quot;King of the Libyan Kingdom&quot;) until 1 September 1969.
*Maldives – between 1965 and 1968, Muhammad Fareed Didi ruled the Maldives as &quot;Jala&#x27;ala ul-Malik&quot; (&quot;King&quot; and the style of &quot;His Majesty&quot;); previous rulers were styled Sultan of Land and Sea and Lord of the twelve-thousand islands, holding both the Arabic title of Sultan and the more ancient Divehi title of Maha Radun or Ras Kilege.
*Oman – the Nabhani dynasty ruled Oman between 1154 and 1470; later it was an imamate / Sultanate.
*Tunisia was formerly ruled by maliks (1 year).
*Yemen – between 1918 and 27 September 1962, and in dissidence to March 1970, the imamate of Yemen was ruled by &quot;Imam al-Muslimin, Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin, Malik al-Mamlaka al-Mutawakkiliyya al-Yamaniyya&quot; (&quot;Imam of the Muslims, Commander of the Faithful, King of the Mutawakkilite Yemeni Kingdom&quot;).
*Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India – The Muslim rulers bestowed the title of &quot;Malik&quot; on loyal tribal leaders and chieftains in South Asia. The Mughal and colonial India, the princely state of Zainabad, Vanod was ruled by a Malek Shri (Shri is an emphatical honorific).

Malik has also been used in languages which adopted Arabic loanwords (mainly, not exclusively, in Muslim cultures), for various princely or lower ranks and functions.
* In Armenia, the title of Melik was bestowed upon princes who ruled various principalities, often referred to as Melikdoms.
* In Georgia, among the numerous Grandees, often related to Armenia:
** In the fourth class, (&quot;Sul-didibuli-tavadi&quot;) of the Kingdom of Kartli, commanders of banners (&quot;sadrosho&quot;), sixth and last in that class, the Malik of Somkhiti (Somkhiti is the name of Armenia in Georgian).
** In the sixth class, Grandees of the second class (&quot;mtavari&quot;) of the Kingdom of Kartli, ranking first of the second subclass, Grandees under the Prince of Sabaratiano: the Malik of Lori (Lori – a region in Armenia), head of the house of Melikishvili.

The word Malik is sometimes used in Arabic to render roughly equivalent titles of foreign rulers, for instance the chronicler Baha al-Din Ibn Shaddad refers to King Richard I of England as &quot;Malik al-Inkitar&quot;.

==Religious==

*The sacrament of Holy Leaven in the Assyrian Church of the East
*It is also one of the Names of God in Islam, and is then &quot;al-Malik&quot; (الملك) or &quot;The King, Lord of the Worlds&quot; in the absolute sense (denoted by the definite article), meaning the King of Kings, above all earthly rulers.
**Hence, Abdelmelik (&quot;servant of [Allah] the King&quot;) is an Arabic male name.
*In Biblical Hebrew, Moloch is either the name of a god or a particular kind of sacrifice associated historically with Phoenician and related cultures in North Africa and the Levant.
*Melqart (&quot;king of the city&quot;) was a Phoenician and Punic god.
*The Melkites (from Syriac &quot;malkāyâ&quot;, ܡܠܟܝܐ, &quot;imperial&quot;) are the members of several Christian churches of the Middle East, originally those who sided with the Byzantine emperor.

==Compound and derived titles==

*&quot;Malika&quot; is the female derivation, a term of Arabic origin used in Persia as the title for a Queen consort. Frequently also used as part of a lady&#x27;s name, e.g. &quot;Malika-i-Jahan&quot; &#x27;Queen of the World&#x27;.
*&quot;Sahib us-Sumuw al-Malik&quot; (female Sahibat us-Sumuw al-Malik) is an Arabic title for His/Her Royal Highness, notably for Princes in the dynasty of the Malik of Egypt.

The following components are frequently part of titles, notably in Persian (also used elsewhere, e.g. in India&#x27;s Moghol tradition):
*- ul-Mulk (or ul-Molk): – of the kingdom; e.g. Malik Usman Khan, who served the Sultan of Gujarat as Governor of Lahore, received the title of &quot;Zubdat ul-Mulk&quot; &#x27;best of the kingdom&#x27; as a hereditary distinction, which was retained as part of the style of his heirs, the ruling Diwans (only since 1910 promoted to Nawab) of Palanpur.
*- ul-Mamaluk (plural of &quot;ul-mulk&quot;): – of the kingdoms.

In the great Indian Muslim salute state of Hyderabad, a first rank- vassal of the Mughal padshah (emperor) imitating his lofty Persian court protocol, the word Molk became on itself one of the titles used for ennobled Muslim retainers of the ruling Nizam&#x27;s court, in fact the third in rank, only below Jah (the highest) and Umara, but above Daula, Jang, Nawab, Khan Bahadur and Khan; for the Nizam&#x27;s Hindu retainers different titles were used, the equivalent of Molk being Vant.

==Usage in South Asia==

=== Pashtun usage ===
The Arabic term came to be adopted as a term for &quot;tribal chieftain&quot; in the tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. In tribal Pashtun society in Pakistan, the Maliks serve as &quot;de facto&quot; arbiters in local conflicts, interlocutors in state policy-making, tax-collectors, heads of village and town councils and delegates to provincial and national &quot;jirgas&quot; and Parliament.

===Punjabi usage===
In the Punjab, &quot;Malik&quot;, literally meaning &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; is a title used by some well-reputed specific Punjabi aristocrat bloodlines with special lineage, more formally known as Zamindars. The Actual clans to hold and originate this esteemed title are the &quot;Awan&quot; Tribe, They are Martial Warrior Tribes which are also associated with different aspects throughout different generations and periods of history, It is believed that they originated as a clan of warriors who later on settled as wealthy landlords. Malik Awans in Punjabi Ethnology are considered to be Honourable Warriors.

The Muslim Malik community is settled all over Pakistan, and the Sikh Malik are settled in India. The Malik are also known as the Gathwala. The Gathwala are now designating themselves as Maliks. Due to the popularity of the Malik title, many Punjabi sub-castes, such as Gujarati⠀Punjabis and many others, have adopted title to gain acceptance in the Punjabi caste system.

Malik or Malek is a common element in first and family names, usually without any aristocratic meaning.

<text>Shyama Charan Lahiri (30 September 1828 – 26 September 1895), best known as Lahiri Mahasaya, was an Indian yogi and guru who founded the Kriya Yoga school. He was a disciple of Mahavatar Babaji. According to the book &quot;America&#x27;s Alternative Religions&quot; by Timothy Miller, Lahiri Mahasaya&#x27;s life was described in Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; as a demonstration of the spiritual attainment that could be achieved by a householder &quot;living fully in the world&quot;. A part of Lahiri Mahasaya&#x27;s face is pictured on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

== Biography ==
Lahiri Mahasaya was born to Bengali Brahmin
parents Gourmohan and Muktakeshi Lahiri on 30 September 1828, in village Ghurni, Dist. Nadia, West Bengal, India, according to Yogananda. In 1832, a flood killed his mother and destroyed their home, after which his family moved to Varanasi, where he received education in philosophy, Sanskrit, and English. His father arranged for him to be married to Kashimoni in 1846, and he taught her how to read. In 1851, he began working as a clerk and tutor.

On 27 November 1861, Lahiri Mahasaya met Babaji in Ranikhet. Babaji taught him a meditation technique called Kriya Yoga, which Lahiri Mahasaya then taught to many others, including his wife, Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s parents, and Sri Yukteswar Giri, guru of Yogananda.

<text>The Polish Workers&#x27; Party (, PPR) was a communist party in Poland from 1942 to 1948. It was founded as a reconstitution of the Communist Party of Poland (KPP) and merged with the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) in 1948 to form the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). From the end of World War II the PPR led Poland, with the Soviet Union exercising moderate influence. During the PPR years, the centers of opposition activity were largely diminished, and a socialist system was established in the country.

Arriving from the Soviet Union, a group of Polish communists was parachuted into occupied Poland in December 1941. With Joseph Stalin&#x27;s permission, in January 1942 they established the Polish Workers&#x27; Party, a new communist party. The PPR established a partisan military organization &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot;, later renamed &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot;. In November 1943, Władysław Gomułka became secretary (chief executive) of the Central Committee of the PPR. On 1 January 1944 the party created the State National Council (KRN), proclaimed to be a wartime parliament of Poland; the body was chaired by Bolesław Bierut. In June 1944 the Union of Polish Patriots, a rival to the PPR Polish-communist organization operating in the Soviet Union, recognized the KRN as &quot;the true representation of the Polish nation&quot;. The PPR was initially a small party with marginal support; it grew because of its alliance with the victorious Soviet Union.

In July 1944 the Polish communists, working in close cooperation with Stalin and other Soviet leaders, established and declared in liberated Lublin a provisional executive quasi-government of Poland, which they called the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN). In the PKWN Manifesto issued at that time, the PKWN claimed its authority in Poland and promised post-war reconstruction as well as land reform. The KRN and the PKWN were established when the Polish government-in-exile in London was the internationally recognized government of Poland. By the end of 1944, the PKWN was replaced with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, recognized by the Soviet Union, with which it signed in April 1945 a 20-year friendship, alliance and cooperation treaty. As a result of the Yalta Conference Allied determinations, the Provisional Government was converted to a formally coalition Provisional Government of National Unity (TRJN) in June 1945. The Polish government-in-exile was excluded from participation and the PPR ended up controlling the new government, which was soon recognized by the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Establishment of a permanent government was conditioned on national elections being held, as mandated by the Allies. In the meantime the PPR engaged in a massive program of rebuilding the country and its industry, in combating and containing the various forms and manifestations of opposition to its rule, but also in manipulating the election preparation process to ensure the party&#x27;s lasting domination.

The 1946 Polish people&#x27;s referendum and the following 1947 Polish legislative election were rigged and declared a decisive victory of the PPR&#x27;s &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot;. The only legal opposition, the Polish People&#x27;s Party, was marginalized. Gomułka&#x27;s victory, however, was short-lived. Pressured by the Cold War, Stalin had no more patience for the Polish leader&#x27;s national brand of communism, and from August 1948 the PPR was led by Bierut. In December 1948, the PPR and the purged PPS were merged to form the PZPR. What was left of democratic and pluralistic practices and pretenses was abandoned and Poland entered its period of Stalinist rule.

==Communist Party of Poland and its demise==

The Communist Party of Poland (KPP, until 1925 the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Poland) was an organization of the far-left. The views adhered to and promulgated by its leaders (Maria Koszutska, Adolf Warski, Maksymilian Horwitz, Edward Próchniak) led to the party&#x27;s difficult relationship with Joseph Stalin already in 1923–24. The Communist International (Comintern) condemned the KPP for its support of Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May Coup of 1926 (the party&#x27;s &quot;May error&quot;). From 1933, the KPP was increasingly treated with suspicion by the Comintern. The party structures were seen as compromised due to infiltration by agents of the Polish military intelligence. Some of the party leaders, falsely accused of being such agents, were subsequently executed in the Soviet Union. In 1935 and 1936, the KPP undertook a formation of a unified worker and peasant front in Poland and was then subjected to further persecutions by the Comintern, which also arbitrarily accused the Polish communists of harboring Trotskyists elements in their ranks. The apogee of the Moscow-held prosecutions, aimed at eradicating the various &quot;deviations&quot; and ending usually in death sentences, took place in 1937–38, with the last executions carried out in 1940. The KPP members were persecuted and often imprisoned by the Polish Sanation regime, which turned out to likely save the lives of a number of future Polish communist leaders, including Bolesław Bierut, Władysław Gomułka, Edward Ochab, Stefan Jędrychowski and Aleksander Zawadzki. During the Great Purge, seventy members and candidate members of the party&#x27;s Central Committee fled or were brought to the Soviet Union and were shot there, along with a large number of other activists (almost all prominent Polish communists were murdered or sent to labor camps). The Comintern, in reality directed by Stalin, had the party dissolved and liquidated in August 1938.

==The PPR&#x27;s World War II foundations==

On 28 June 1940, soon after the Katyn massacre, Stalin received Wanda Wasilewska, an unofficial leader of Polish communists, at the Moscow Kremlin. The event initiated a reorientation of Soviet policies in regard to Poles. As a result, a wide range of official political, military, social, cultural, educational and other Soviet-Polish projects and activities commenced in 1940 and continued during the years that followed.

The German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 changed the course of World War II and with it the nature of Polish-Soviet governmental relations. Pressured by the British government, the London-based Polish government-in-exile, led by Władysław Sikorski, signed an agreement with the Soviet Union, which included a Soviet recognition of the Polish government. A Polish army was formed in the Soviet Union, but was soon taken out of there and into the Middle East by Władysław Anders. The Katyn massacre perpetrated by the Soviets on Polish POWs was revealed and the Soviet Union &quot;suspended&quot; diplomatic relations with the Polish government. Prime Minister Sikorski was killed in an airplane crash in July 1943. These and other factors, including disagreements about future borders, caused the Polish-Soviet relations to deteriorate.

Meanwhile, Stalin, beginning in the summer of 1941, pursued other Polish options, utilizing Polish communists and other Poles willing to cooperate, many of whom were present at that time in the Soviet Union. Polish language radio broadcasts began in August 1941; they called upon the Poles in Poland to unconditionally engage in anti-German resistance. Some prewar Polish officers were transferred to occupied Poland to conduct pro-Soviet conspiratorial activities and the Polish communists worked in November on organizing the Poles in the Soviet Union. Among the communist groups that became active in Poland after Operation Barbarossa was the Union for Liberating Struggle (&quot;Związek Walki Wyzwoleńczej&quot;), whose leaders included Marian Spychalski.

A September 1941 attempt to transport activists from the Soviet Union to Poland was unsuccessful, but beginning in late December, a group of Polish communists which included Marceli Nowotko, Paweł Finder, Bolesław Mołojec and Małgorzata Fornalska, was parachuted into Poland. They had Stalin&#x27;s permission to create a new Polish communist party. In Polish society the communists could count on marginal support only, so to avoid negative connotations it was decided not to include the word &quot;communist&quot; in the party&#x27;s title. The party took the name &quot;Polish Workers&#x27; Party.&quot; The PPR, intended in some sense as a continuation of the prewar KPP, was established in Warsaw on 5 January 1942, when some of the new arrivals met with local communist activists.

The new party, which presented itself as an anti-Nazi Polish patriotic front, distributed a manifesto printed in Moscow entitled &quot;To workers, peasants and intelligentsia! To all Polish patriots!&quot;, in which it called for an uncompromising struggle against the German occupier. A leftist, formally democratic program was proposed and the party, whose operations concentrated mostly in the General Government, grew to about six thousand members by the summer of 1942. From 1943, an affiliated youth organization existed; it was called the Union for the Struggle of the Youth (&quot;Związek Walki Młodych&quot;).

The PPR operated under the Central Committee led by Secretary Marceli Nowotko. Nowotko was killed on 28 November 1942. Mołojec took over as secretary (party chief), but he was suspected of arranging Nowotko&#x27;s murder and subsequently condemned and executed by the ruling of the party court. In January 1943, Finder became secretary and the three-person Secretariat also included Władysław Gomułka and Franciszek Jóźwiak.

Gwardia Ludowa (the People&#x27;s Guard) military organization originated together with the party it served. It was led by Mołojec and then Jóźwiak. Gwardia Ludowa attacked Germans in Warsaw and organized partisan units in the countryside, primarily to destroy the German communication facilities.

In February 1943 the PPR undertook talks with the Government Delegation for Poland, which represented in occupied Poland the Polish government-in-exile, and the central command of the underground Home Army, on possible cooperation. The negotiations made no progress because of the irreconcilable points of view of the two sides. After the Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government (25 April 1943), the contacts were terminated and the PPR&#x27;s attitude toward the exile government-led Polish authority became hostile.

The war progressively radicalized Polish society and the communists tried to take advantage of the situation by forming a coalition with other leftist and agrarian forces. However, a common &quot;democratic front&quot;, meant as a platform for the future power struggle, failed to materialize because the rival parties were generally unwilling to cooperate with the PPR.

==Polish communist institutions in the Soviet Union==

Facilitated by Stalin, communist-controlled Polish civilian and military institutions were also formed in the Soviet Union. The leading roles in them were initially assumed by Wanda Wasilewska, a daughter of former Polish minister and Piłsudski&#x27;s associate, herself a friend of Stalin, and the Polish officer Zygmunt Berling. From October 1940, Berling led a group of Polish officers working to establish a Polish division within the Soviet Red Army. The Union of Polish Patriots, proposed and organized from January 1943, had its founding congress in June 1943 and was led by Wasilewska. Berling, Alfred Lampe, Stefan Jędrychowski, Andrzej Witos and Bolesław Drobner were among the communists and individuals of other political orientations active in the organization, people willing to participate in a communist-dominated undertaking. After the Soviet authorities closed the branches of the Polish government&#x27;s delegation in Soviet controlled territories, the union, assisted by a Soviet agency, established a social welfare department to look after the Poles scattered throughout its range of operations. The Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, commanded by Berling, was formed beginning in May 1943. The division fought at the Battle of Lenino in October 1943. The Polish National Committee, intended to develop into a communist government, was organized under Wasilewska from December 1943, but its formation was abandoned when Moscow found out about the existence of the State National Council in Warsaw. The Polish civilian and military activities in the Soviet Union were managed from January 1944 by the Central Bureau Communists of Poland. Its important members were Chairman Aleksander Zawadzki, Wasilewska, Karol Świerczewski, Jakub Berman, Stanisław Radkiewicz, Roman Zambrowski, Hilary Minc and Marian Spychalski. Some of them would later form the core of the Stalinist and strictly pro-Soviet (internationalist in outlook) faction of Poland&#x27;s ruling communists, who worked closely with Bolesław Bierut and were opposed to the national PPR current led by Gomułka. On the military side, the First Polish Corps was formed from the Kościuszko Division and expanded into the First Polish Army in March 1944, still under command of General Berling. The army was incorporated into the 1st Belorussian Front.

==Gomułka&#x27;s leadership, State National Council, Polish Committee of National Liberation==

In November 1943 Finder and Fornalska were arrested by the Gestapo, which also took the PPR&#x27;s radio equipment. Communication between Warsaw and Moscow was no longer possible. Władysław Gomułka became secretary of the Central Committee of the PPR on 23 November 1943 and Bierut became a member of the Secretariat.

The PPR published the &quot;What are we fighting for&quot; (&quot;O co walczymy&quot;) program declaration. Democratic ideas and future elections were proclaimed there, while the government-in-exile and the Underground State were denied the right to represent the Polish nation. Territorial changes after the war were indicated and nationalization of industry was promised together with land reform.

At that time the Central Committee decided to create the State National Council (&quot;Krajowa Rada Narodowa&quot;, KRN), a quasi-parliament rival to the government-in-exile and the Underground State institutions. The council was established on 1 January 1944 and was chaired by Bierut. Members of splinter socialist and peasant groups were co-opted to participate. The communist partisan military formation was now named Armia Ludowa (AL); it was placed under command of General Michał Rola-Żymierski.

After communications with Moscow were restored, a KRN delegation left for Moscow. Upon arriving there, they were officially greeted by Soviet officials and in June the Union of Polish Patriots had to recognize the KRN as the &quot;true representation of the Polish nation&quot;. After the second KRN delegation arrived in Moscow, the Polish communists, in close cooperation with Stalin and other Soviet leaders, began working on a temporary executive government to administer the Polish lands (west of the Bug River) liberated by the Soviet and Polish communist armies. On 22 July 1944 the new organ, named the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), was officially established in the Lublin province. The PKWN Manifesto was issued, in which the committee claimed its authority in liberated Poland and announced fundamental and wide-ranging reconstruction and systemic changes, most prominently a land reform, to be implemented in the country. The socialist Edward Osóbka-Morawski was the PKWN&#x27;s head and General Żymierski led the defense department, which diminished the role of General Berling. Most of the remaining PPR and KRN leaders left Warsaw and entered the Soviet-controlled territory. Zenon Kliszko and few others stayed in the capital to coordinate communist activities in the still occupied part of Poland.

==Government-in-exile after Sikorski&#x27;s death==

After the death of Prime Minister Sikorski, the important figures in the exile government in London were President Władysław Raczkiewicz, the newly nominated Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk and Commander-in-chief Kazimierz Sosnkowski. During the Tehran Conference (November–December 1943) Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill determined the geographic location of the future Polish state (between the Oder River and the Curzon Line) without consulting or even notifying the Polish leaders. Czechoslovakia, previously Poland&#x27;s partner for a planned confederation, signed in December 1943 a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. As a result of the developing Soviet wartime advantage, the Polish government was gradually abandoned by its allies.

Early in January 1944, the Soviet forces crossed the 1939 border of Poland. The British pressured the Polish government to accept the Soviet conditions for a resumption of Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations and practical cooperation (a recognition of the Curzon Line border and removal of anti-Soviet politicians from the Polish government), but the Polish side balked. Mikołajczyk advocated compromising with the Soviets for the sake of preserving the country&#x27;s independence, while Sosnkowski, counting on the outbreak of war between the Allies, rejected making any concessions. In February Churchill publicly announced his government&#x27;s support for a Curzon Line Polish-Soviet border anyway.

In June 1944, Mikołajczyk officially traveled to the United States, where President Roosevelt suggested that he visits the Soviet Union to conduct political discussions. Roosevelt also asked Stalin to invite the Polish prime minister for talks on a resumption of bilateral relations. On 30 July Mikołajczyk arrived in Moscow accompanied by Foreign Minister Tadeusz Romer and Stanisław Grabski, chairman of the National Council. The PKWN had already been established and Stalin proposed negotiations between the two Polish representations aimed at their unification. The talks with Bierut, Osóbka-Morawski and Wasilewska did take place, but Mikołajczyk found the communist ideas and demands unacceptable, even though he was offered the job of prime minister in a combined government. The PKWN leaders were willing to grant the pro-Western Poles only four out of the eighteen discussed ministerial seats. Mikołajczyk reported to the government delegate in Poland that the Soviets would consider establishing diplomatic relations if the Poles first agreed between themselves, that &quot;the Soviet government has not yet finally sided with the (Polish) communists&quot;, but &quot;Polish communists are determined to exploit the situation for turning Poland into a communist state&quot;. Thus the prime minister, himself unable to convince his government of the necessity of offering significant concessions to victorious communists, believed that Polish communist leaders were effectively blocking his deal with Stalin. After Mikołajczyk&#x27;s return to London, the government-in-exile came up with its own version of compromise proposals which included the PPR&#x27;s participation in the government, but they were rejected by the PKWN.

==Defeat of Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising==

In 1944, the lack of Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations and the resultant inability to conduct negotiations forced the Polish leadership to undertake political and military actions in an attempt to create a &quot;fait accompli&quot; situation in Poland that the Soviets would be compelled to accept. According to the planned Operation Tempest, the retreating German forces would be attacked by the Home Army, temporary Polish civilian administration would be installed in the liberated areas and its members, representing the government-in-exile, would greet the incoming Soviets as the rightful hosts. Consequently, in the spring and summer of 1944, the Polish underground waged numerous military operations in the areas where the Soviet advance was taking place. The actions resulted in military and political defeats, because the Soviets disarmed, arrested and deported the Home Army fighters, while the Western Allies cultivated good relations with the Soviet Union and were not interested in investigating the Polish claims of mistreatment or lending the Poles practical support. Fighting and winning a battle for Warsaw seemed the only opportunity left for the mainstream Polish independence movement.

The establishment of the PKWN provided an additional motivation for starting the Warsaw Uprising on 1 August 1944. The Soviets did not join the battle and stopped their offensive. The insurgents were being overpowered by the Germans and the belated rescue attempt in September by the 1st Infantry Division of Berling&#x27;s First Polish Army ended in a bloody defeat. The Home Army capitulated on 2 October, Warsaw was subsequently largely demolished per Adolf Hitler&#x27;s orders, and the Polish government-in-exile was no longer capable of staging major armed demonstrations in Poland. General Sosnkowski, having criticized the lack of effective aid to the Warsaw Uprising participants from the Allies, was removed from his top command position in September 1944.

==Mikołajczyk&#x27;s resignation, Provisional Government==

In October, Churchill and Anthony Eden went to Moscow, as did Mikołajczyk, Grabski and Romer. They negotiated again with Bierut, Osóbka-Morawski and Rola-Żymierski. Mikołajczyk resisted the British and Soviet pressure to accept the communist territorial and other demands. In November in London, the Polish government rejected the Curzon Line border again. President Roosevelt disappointed the Poles by designating the Polish, British and Soviet governments as the proper forum for border discussions, but Prime Minister Mikołajczyk, unable to convince his colleagues of the need for further compromises, resigned on 24 November 1944. The Polish government, now led by Tomasz Arciszewski, was no longer seriously considered by the Allies.

On 31 December 1944, the State National Council converted the PKWN to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, with Osóbka-Morawski as the prime minister. The Soviet Union recognized the new institution and the Western Allies did not object. The KRN and the Provisional Government gradually strengthened their position, as the Soviet NKVD facilitated the process by performing large scale arrests of opponents of communist rule.

The Provisional Government signed a 20-year friendship, alliance and cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union on 21 April 1945.

==Communist-led war effort==

The leftist, Soviet-allied Polish armed forces, placed under the authority of the PKWN and then the Provisional Government, were rapidly expanded, ultimately to about 400,000 people in two armies. In the summer of 1944, the First Polish Army established bridgeheads on the Vistula&#x27;a left bank south of Warsaw and in August its 1st Armoured Brigade fought the Germans at the Battle of Studzianki.

Many diversionary military actions and other combat operations were undertaken by Armia Ludowa and the Soviet partisans in September and October 1944, especially, but not only, in the Kielce province. At the end of October, led by the AL commander Mieczysław Moczar, most units broke through the front lines to the Soviet-Polish side.

The Soviet offensive was resumed on 12 January 1945. On 17 January the First Polish Army led by General Stanisław Popławski entered the destroyed Warsaw. It fought on the 1st Belorussian Front and during the following month participated in overcoming strongly fortified German defenses at the Pomeranian Wall, losing 6,500 soldiers; in March it took Kolberg. The 1st Armoured Brigade fought within the 2nd Belorussian Front and contributed to the liberation of Gdańsk and Gdynia. The First Army forced its way across the Oder River on 16–17 April and reached the Elbe near Spandau on 3 May. Its 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division and other Polish formations participated in the final Battle of Berlin. The Second Polish Army, led by General Karol Świerczewski, operated with the 1st Ukrainian Front. It crossed the Lusatian Neisse on 16 April and heading for Dresden suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Bautzen, due to poor command. However, a German rescue force heading for Berlin was stopped. Helping to defeat Nazi Germany in Poland, the two Polish armies suffered losses equal to the Polish military losses encountered during the September Campaign of 1939—66,000 soldiers killed (according to Antoni Czubiński).

==Provisional Government of National Unity==

The Polish social Left was critical with respect to the prewar Sanation-ruled Second Polish Republic and called for the establishment of a more just and democratic post-war Poland. A return to the March Constitution of 1921 was advocated. These postulates and the Soviet demand for Poland&#x27;s eastern Kresy territories were accepted by the PPR and allied Polish Socialist Party (PPS) leaders, with considerable support from the agrarian movement politicians, who were also opposed to the April Constitution (1935) regime. Leftist sentiments, increasingly prevalent in Poland in 1944 and 1945, mixed with the widespread unease and fear regarding Poland&#x27;s expected domination by the Soviet Union.

Further determinations regarding the future of Poland were made at the Yalta Conference in February 1945. The United States and Britain accepted the Soviet position in respect to postwar borders (the extent of Poland&#x27;s western expansion at the expense of Germany was not specified), but differed with the Soviets on the issue of participation of the London-based government-in-exile in the formation of Poland&#x27;s new compromise government. The Allied leaders ultimately authorized converting the existing in Poland, communist-dominated Provisional Government to Provisional Government of National Unity (TRJN), with greater participation of democratic and pro-Western forces, but no formal role for the government-in-exile. The TRJN was charged with conducting free elections soon, based on which a permanent Polish government would be established. As for the practical implementation, a commission representing the three great powers negotiated the issue of the TRJN in Moscow and the talks had been stalled for a long time, until joined by former Prime Minister Mikołajczyk of the government-in-exile. In June Mikołajczyk agreed to a temporary deal, which turned out to permanently favor the communist side.

The exact shape of the TRJN was determined during talks in Moscow on 16–21 June 1945. The KRN and the Provisional Government were represented there by seven politicians, including Bierut and Gomułka, three representatives, including Mikołajczyk, came from the emigrant circles and there were five non-communists from Poland. Mikołajczyk unsuccessfully tried to limit the dominant role of the communists and became only a deputy prime minister. Mikołajczyk&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party was granted the right to nominate ⅓ of the KRN members; Wincenty Witos and Stanisław Grabski were the new vice-chairmen of that body. On 28 June 1945, Chairman Bierut of the KRN created the TRJN, and on 5 July the US and the United Kingdom withdrew their recognition of the government-in-exile.

The TRJN was led by the socialist Prime Minister Osóbka-Morawski of the previous Provisional Government. Gomułka and Mikołajczyk were included as deputy prime ministers. The formally coalition government had seven PPR members, six from the peasant People&#x27;s Party and Polish Socialist Party each, and two from the centrist Democratic Alliance (SD). The government was controlled by the PPR and other politicians reconciled to the reality of Soviet domination. Mikołajczyk&#x27;s party however, aware of its popularity, counted on winning the planned parliamentary elections and was the only participant that actually thought of the TRJN as being temporary.

==Formation of a new sociopolitical system, PPR&#x27;s role and program==

Operating within the Soviet-controlled international environment, regardless of the results of the upcoming mandated elections, the Polish communists had no intention of giving up political power and made no secret of it. Nonetheless, many of them believed that the reforms they undertook under the evolving new system would remain popular and would enable them to win future elections.

The PPR invoked the tradition of social struggle in the Second Polish Republic and the party gained support of many politicians of leftist orientation from the peasant and socialist movements, who shared that point of view. The PPR promised radical land ownership and agrarian reforms as well as nationalization of the industry, banking and trade. The communists used nationalistic rhetoric of the prewar National Democracy movement in regard to the post-German &quot;Recovered Territories&quot;.

A &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot; of parties was organized around the PPR; it included pro-communist factions of the socialist, agrarian and centrist movements. Mikołajczyk&#x27;s Polish People&#x27;s Party was legalized and functioned independently as the only formal opposition; other political formations were banned and their supporters persecuted.

The PPR itself comprised different factions, reflecting different experiences of its members. Some of the PPR leaders referred to the Communist International tradition and proclaimed internationalist ideas. They believed in strict hegemony of the Soviet Union, which they saw as both necessary and desirable. This group was led by activists of Jewish origin: Jakub Berman, Hilary Minc and Roman Zambrowski, and by Bolesław Bierut. Berman, Minc and Zambrowski spent the war in the Soviet Union and were leaders of Polish-communist organizations formed there under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s supervision. PPR chief Władysław Gomułka led the faction that also believed in the (politically necessary) Polish-Soviet alliance, but wanted to form it on more pragmatic bases. They stressed the Polish national interest and wished to pursue a more limited cooperation, as conditioned by that interest. All PPR factions were actually strongly dependent on and therefore practically dominated by Stalin&#x27;s regime.

In a broader historical perspective, the cooperation of Polish communists, other leftists and some non-leftist politicians with Stalin prevented a territorial reduction of the Polish state of great magnitude. In geopolitical reality, such reduction would be irreversible.

==Incorporation of post-German territories, postwar reconstruction and state socialist reforms==

Poland&#x27;s eastern borders had not become a major international issue, as the Western powers accepted the Soviet position in this regard. Decisions concerning the Polish–German border were made at the Potsdam Conference, where Stalin lobbied for Poland&#x27;s maximal extension in the west, arranged for the Polish government delegation to present their point of view and in the end thwarted the long-standing British policy (aimed at keeping some of the lands in question for the future German state). In Poland, the PPR led the massive &quot;Recovered Territories&quot; propaganda campaign, the Allied-authorized expulsion of ethnic Germans and the repopulation of the region by Poles &quot;repatriated&quot; from the lost Kresy eastern areas. The exact eastern boundary was determined in the Polish–Soviet treaty signed on 16 August 1945, which finalized the contested issue of Lviv (the city stayed on the Soviet Ukrainian side of the border). The resettlement of Ukrainians who lived on the Polish side followed.

The settlement and development of post-German lands was considered a high priority and the Ministry of the Recovered Territories, established in November 1945, was led by Gomułka himself. Being convinced of the crucial importance of the acquired areas for Poland, he energetically pursued their economic development and integration with the rest of the country. After the war, Polish officials had to engage in complicated bargaining with the Soviet authorities, who considered industrial installations in former Germany their war loot and wanted to take as much of it as possible to the Soviet Union. 
The land reform decree was issued by the PKWN on 6 September 1944. Over one million peasant families benefited from the parcellation of larger estates and post-German property (6 million hectares of land). The act and its implementation concluded the various land reform attempts and partial realizations that went back to the partitioned Poland and Second Polish Republic periods. Thousands of State Agricultural Farms were also established (1.5 million hectares). They were intended as model farming enterprises, demonstrating, in addition to their role in food production, the progressive ways of agriculture. The reforms, whose consequences fundamentally altered the antiquated social and economic structure of Polish society, were sharply criticized by advocates of the inviolability of property rights. Existence as a social class of &quot;ziemiaństwo&quot; (large scale land owners) was undercut, while the free market economic system was for the most part still functioning in the country.

Reforms of more moderate nature were undertaken in regard to private industry. Various, sometimes chaotic developments took place in 1944–45, including the taking over of thousands of enterprises by workers&#x27; councils. A charged national debate that followed resulted in the KRN statute of 3 January 1946. It was decided that the state would take over enterprises that employed over 50 people on a given shift, but the owners who were Polish or foreign (not German) would be paid compensation. Based on that statute, 5,870 enterprises were nationalized by 1948, while 15,700 were left in private hands.

Central planning got started with the establishment of the Central Planning Office in November 1945, directed by socialist Czesław Bobrowski. The Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers was led by Hilary Minc. The economic reconstruction of Poland was undertaken, combined with prospective planning for the next 12 years. 230,000 residential apartments were built in the cities and 300,000 in the country in 1945–47, which resulted in more evenly spread population, living under considerably improved conditions.

Compulsory general education was brought back and higher education was tuition free. A shortage of teachers had to be addressed first and many were needed, given the massive program of elimination of illiteracy and part-time evening schooling for the employed. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) helped with food, clothes and equipment for the Polish people (the assistance amounted to 22% of the country&#x27;s national income in 1946). Inflation went up to 38% in 1947, but was brought down to 4% in 1949. In late 1946 Poland&#x27;s economy approached the 1938 prewar level, which allowed gradual discontinuation of the previously imposed rationing of mass consumption products.

Legislation concerning the Three-Year Plan (1947–49) for economic development was passed by the KRN in 1946 and again in 1947 by the new &quot;Legislative &quot;Sejm&quot;&quot; (parliament) that replaced the KRN after the 1947 Polish legislative election. In 1947, the &quot;Sejm&quot; proclaimed the right to work. Unemployment was eliminated and real wages increased by 58% during the plan years, but still lagged behind their 1938 level. The public sector produced 50% of the national income in 1947, which went up to 64% in 1949. The private sector was being reduced, while the network of cooperative enterprises experienced significant growth in the area of trade.

==Political struggle and persecution of opposition==

Politicians in Poland connected in the past to the Sanation and National Democracy formations did not recognize the new realities and waged a determined campaign against the communist authorities, boycotting decisions of the government, especially the ones having to do with the establishment of administrative and military structures. This led to conflicts and intensified repressions. Polish internal security organs were created and resolved, in cooperation with their Soviet counterparts, to disable the opposition using persecution and terror. The political confrontations were accompanied by armed activity of anti-government conspiracy groups.

The Polish Catholic Church, led by Cardinal August Hlond until his death in 1948, took an anti-regime stand. It coped with difficulties related to the lack of Polish church organization in the Recovered Territories. In the fall of 1945, with permission from the Vatican, the Church embarked on the establishment of provisional administrative structures in the territories taken from Germany. Authorization for permanent Polish church administration there was not forthcoming and the instability in this area added to the existing German-Polish antagonisms.

In April 1946, a new volunteer citizen militia ORMO was formed to help the police (&quot;Milicja Obywatelska&quot;), political police (UBP), the Internal Security Corps, the Polish army, the Soviet political police (NKVD), and the Soviet army to eliminate armed opposition to the government. The NKVD killed, arrested, harassed, and used propaganda to suppress and discredit opponents of the regime. Already during the 1944–48 period, many were imprisoned or taken to the Soviet Union, some executed under court rulings. The whole security system was directed by Soviet politician Lavrentiy Beria.

On May 23, 1946, the Central Committee of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party passed a resolution to establish the Department of Party History at the Central Committee. Its goal was pro-communist propaganda and slandering independence movements. The resolution provided for the creation of 4 positions for political and scientific workers. The same resolution appointed Regina Kaplan-Kobrynska as the first head of the department.

Government authorities offered two amnesties for fighters from the opposition militia groups, which originated from remnants of the disbanded Home Army and other organizations. Tens of thousands of oppositionists took advantage of the amnesties declared in 1945 and 1947. Some were subjected to further prosecution and imprisonment, but the amnesties effectively terminated the anti-communist armed resistance movement.

==Elections of 1947 and elimination of legal opposition==

The replacement of postwar cooperation among the great powers with the Cold War derailed the planned peace conference—the issue of Poland&#x27;s western border was not going to be amicably resolved. In the West only France clearly upheld its support for Poland in the border dispute. &quot;Revisionist&quot; circles had a prominent voice in what was becoming West Germany and the PPR, for existential reasons, felt compelled to strengthen its policy of reliance on the Soviet Union. The TRJN was now in no position to maneuver any degree of independence for itself.

The PPR delayed nationwide parliamentary elections because it believed that the ongoing implementation of reforms would move the public opinion in its favor. The party strengthened its position by first holding a referendum in June 1946, intended as a plebiscite for or against the new system. For the election, the PPR-dominated Democratic Bloc prepared a unified list of candidates; the Polish Socialist Party agreed to join the bloc, but the Polish People&#x27;s Party, led by Mikołajczyk, refused. The bloc was also opposed by other groups, some of which were not legally registered, while other were semi- or fully conspiratorial and hostile to the bloc.

The referendum asked three questions: about abolishing the Senate (parliament&#x27;s upper chamber), future constitutional moderate socialist reforms, and the permanency of Poland&#x27;s western and northern borders. The ruling regime needed to show an overwhelming support for its program before the elections. Accordingly, the referendum was conducted under considerable pressure (such as heavy military and police presence) and the results were falsified to give the Democratic Bloc a strong majority it wanted.

The PPR and its allies in the bloc were large parties, each with membership in hundreds of thousands, supported in addition by the several million-strong trade union structure. They had public security forces at their disposal. The also large and popular People&#x27;s Party invoked Poland&#x27;s Western connections and its tradition of struggles for independence. It was supported by the Catholic clergy. The campaign was harsh and the PPR was often subjected to antisemitic &quot;Żydokomuna&quot; accusations. Given the Soviet pressure, the bloc could not just have won elections by receiving a majority of the votes; it had to produce a result impressive enough for propaganda purposes.

The communists feared losing the elections to Mikołajczyk&#x27;s party and that this outcome would cause a complete Soviet occupation of Poland. During the election campaign, the PPR targeted the People&#x27;s Party, the Democratic Bloc&#x27;s main (but not only) election rival, arresting its candidates, harassing them, and denying them public exposure. About one hundred opposition party activists were murdered; many PPR members were also killed.

In the 1947 Polish legislative election the bloc claimed to have won 80% of the votes, but the election was widely seen as fraudulent. Factors such as the scale of the fraud or who actually received the largest number of votes are not known. The campaign and election results eliminated the People&#x27;s Party from the political scene, which left Poland with no legally functioning opposition. Mikołajczyk, harassed and threatened, fled the country in October 1947.

==Removal of Gomułka, Stalinism, Polish United Workers&#x27; Party==

In accordance with the announced election results, the PPS, which competed within the Democratic Bloc, received two more legislative mandates than the PPR. The Presidency of Poland was reestablished by the &quot;Sejm&quot; and Bolesław Bierut, previously chairman of the KRN, was given that job. Józef Cyrankiewicz, a socialist, became the new prime minister and Gomułka was kept as deputy prime minister. The intermediate Small Constitution of 1947 was passed by the &quot;Sejm&quot;. The newly created Council of State had emergency powers and was led by the president. Despite the elections conducted under communist control and amnesty for armed and political opponents declared by the &quot;Sejm&quot;, the situation in Poland underwent further polarization.

Because of the deepening division in international politics and the emergence of two mutually hostile blocs, Stalin demanded stricter loyalty in the Soviet sphere; purges of circles and individuals considered ideologically corrupt or otherwise unreliable were pursued. Gomułka&#x27;s criticism of Soviet policies was now seen as inappropriately nationalistic. Gomułka&#x27;s &quot;Polish road to socialism&quot;, adapting to conditions specific to Poland, was no longer tolerated as Stalin tightened his control over the PPR. Gomułka and his group were removed from positions of responsibility and in August 1948 the Central Committee installed Bierut as general secretary of the PPR. Bierut would strictly follow the Soviet lead and remold Polish society on the Stalinist model.

The PPR pressured the remaining left-wing faction of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) to merge the two parties. The merger occurred in December 1948 and the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza&quot;, PZPR) was formed. The merger was conducted almost entirely on PPR terms; the PPS had by then been &quot;purified&quot; with the expulsion of hundreds of its members.

The Polish People&#x27;s Party managed to survive for another year, albeit under growing harassment. In 1949, its remains merged with a pro-communist splinter party to form the United People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Zjednoczone Stronnictwo Ludowe&quot;, ZSL).

Under PPR rule, the Republic of Poland was a declared &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot; and was not officially considered a socialist entity. Private property and free market functionality were tolerated and the role of the state was not overly exposed. All this had changed with the establishment of the PZPR: the Six-Year Plan of heavy industrial development was imposed and the building of state socialist system and society commenced in earnest.

<text>Focus Features LLC is an American independent film production and distribution company, owned by Comcast as a unit of sister film production and distribution company Universal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast&#x27;s entertainment division NBCUniversal. Focus Features distributes independent and foreign films in the United States and internationally. 

In November 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; named Focus Features &quot;Distributor of the Year&quot; for its success behind the year&#x27;s breakout documentary film &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot; and Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;. The studio&#x27;s most successful film to date is &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office. 

Focus Features&#x27; films have earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175 Academy Award nominations and 35 wins across various categories. However, they are also the distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 16 nominations as of 2024.

== History ==
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus and David Linde and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus and Good Machine, as well as several assets of the Vivendi-affiliated film studio StudioCanal. USA Films was created by Barry Diller in 1999 when he purchased Interscope Communications, certain assets of the film division of Propaganda Films, October Films and Gramercy Pictures from Seagram and merged the three labels together; USA Films was led by Scott Greenstein. Universal Focus was the specialty film arm of Universal Pictures that was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace the October Films label in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions by Universal Pictures International, Working Title, WT2 Productions, Revolution Films and DNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.

In March 2004, Focus Features revived Rogue Pictures as a genre label, which was once used by October Films in the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.

On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose company FilmDistrict would be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus. Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company. In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.

In February 2016, Focus merged with Universal Pictures International Productions as part of a new strategy to &quot;align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market&quot;. Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced with Peter Kujawski.

In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008 Rogue film library from Focus Features.

=== Focus World ===
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on the video on demand market with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.

As a distributor, Focus&#x27; most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 film &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassing &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, which earned $83 million at the North American box office. However, this is not counting the domestic total of &quot;Traffic&quot;, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated film &quot;Coraline&quot; was also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases. Its DVD and movie rights revenues are boosted by cult classics including &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;.

<text>Quebec comics ( or BDQ) are French language comics produced primarily in the Canadian province of Quebec, and read both within and outside Canada, particularly in French-speaking Europe.

In contrast to English language comics in Canada, which largely follow the American model, Quebec comics are influenced mainly by the trends in Franco-Belgian comics. There is little crossover between the French and English comics worlds in Canada.

==Overview==
The majority language of Quebec is French, and Quebec comics refers to those comics published in French—English-language comics are considered part of the English-language part of Canadian comics history. The two traditions have little crossover, with the English tradition following mainly American trends, and the French tradition following mainly European ones, especially the French language Franco-Belgian trends. However, newspaper comic strips have tended to be French translations of syndicated American strips.

In the early 2000s, most comics consumed within Quebec were of European or American origin, with local comics only making up 5% of the total market, which had been true since the early 1970s. However, several comics of Québécois origin have found success overseas, like Michel Rabagliati&#x27;s &quot;Paul&quot; series and Maryse Dubuc&#x27;s &quot;Les Nombrils&quot; (&quot;The Bellybuttons&quot;), some of these cartoonists have had success with English translations, as when Montreal-based English publisher Drawn &amp; Quarterly picked up Julie Doucet&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Plotte&quot;, which won acclaim and awards in the English-speaking comics world.

==History==
Native Quebec comics have had a long up-and-down history, alternating between periods of flourishing and periods languishing under the deluge of foreign comics.

===19th century===
Caricatures have appeared in newspapers in Quebec since at least the 18th century. A political poster using speech balloons from 1792 has been attested. Most were anonymous, but one, titled &quot;La Ménagerie annexionniste&quot;, by William Augustus Leggo was another early francophone use of speech balloons. Later, speech balloons became more common in caricatures and advertising, and humorous and satirical publications proliferated.

By the end of the century, one could buy compilations of these cartoons and illustrations—the roots of comic albums in Quebec. Between 1878 and 1884, Henri Julien published two books of political caricatures, &quot;L’album drolatique du journal Le Farceur&quot;. In 1900, Morissette published &quot;Petit chien sauvage et savant&quot;, and in 1901 Raoul Barré put out &quot;En roulant ma boule&quot;. Following this, the number of cartoonists in newspapers in Quebec City and Montreal increased.

What has been called the first comic strip in Quebec appeared in 1866. The woodcut serial strip was called &quot;Baptiste Pacôt&quot; and has been attributed to the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Côté. A number of other pantomime or captioned strips appeared throughout the rest of the century. In 1902, Raoul Barré drew the captioned eight-panel strip, &quot;Pour un dîner de Noël&quot;, which was the first known strip to appear in a daily Quebec newspaper. Barré created a strip called &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; in 1912 for the New York-based McClure Syndicate, which he brought to &quot;La Patrie&quot; the next year in French. Soon after he moved into animation and became an innovative pioneer in the field.

Hector Berthelot was a cartoonist and the publisher of &quot;Le Canard&quot;, where Berthelot started running satirical material signed Père Ladébauche (&quot;Father Debauchery&quot;) starting in 1878. Berthelot would bring Ladébauche with him from newspaper to newspaper, and in 1904, Joseph Charlebois&#x27;s comic strip version of &quot;Le Père Ladébauche&quot; debuted in &quot;La Presse&quot;, a popular strip that would last until 1957. &quot;Le Canard&quot; published the works of a number of other notable cartoonists, such as Henri Julien, and it was there that the oldest known comic strip using a speech balloon appeared, an unsigned strip printed on 22 September 1883.

===Early 20th century comic strips===

The popular press began to flourish at the turn of the century, and, as photographic reproduction was still in its infancy, the papers hired cartoonists and illustrators to liven up their pages, with the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; employing up to eight artists. &quot;La Patrie&quot; had convinced Albéric Bourgeois to give up his job at the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and create comic strips for them back in Quebec. 1904 saw, in &quot;La Patrie&quot;, the publication of his &quot;Les Aventures de Timothée&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Timothée&quot;), said to be the first French-language comic to feature speech balloons consistently. This began what historian Michel Viau calls &quot;The Golden Age of the BDQ&quot;.

&quot;La Presse&quot;, in response to &quot;La Patrie&quot;&#x27;s success with &quot;Timothée&quot;, added a weekly children&#x27;s section, &quot;La Ruche enfantine&quot;, which included comic strips. Charlebois&#x27;s &quot;Père Ladébauche&quot; had begun, and after 43 instalments was taken over by Bourgeois, who continued to create other strips as well for &quot;La Presse&quot;, to which he soon moved and stayed with until his 1955 retirement. Théophile Busnel took over &quot;Timothée&quot; and continued it until his sudden death in 1908. It was replaced with a translation of American Richard F. Outcault&#x27;s &quot;Buster Brown&quot;. Soon, other native strips were being replaced with translations of popular American strips, and by 1909, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; that had started in 1904 had come to an end. Native strips didn&#x27;t disappear entirely, but those that remained lost the distinct flavour of contemporary life in Quebec, and began to imitate the silent films and vaudeville that were inundating popular culture in the province.

Québécois cartoonists would unsuccessfully propose a number of strips to compete with the American strips that dominated the Sundays and dailies. The native Quebec presence on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. Comic strips disappeared more-or-less from the dailies during World War I, and didn&#x27;t really return until Arthur Lemay revived &quot;Timothée&quot; for a number of years starting in 1920. Weekend supplements grew, some to as many as 40 pages, but were filled with translations of American strips, which were well-distributed by the growing syndicates, as well as some strips from France. Some native strips continued to appear, however, and in 1935 Albert Chartier made his cartooning debut with a strip called &quot;Bouboule&quot;. In 1943, he created the comical character &quot;Onésime&quot;, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Quebec, and which replaced &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; when it first appeared. It starred a naïve and clumsy country person and his plump and authoritarian wife.

While the adventure strip flourished in the 1930s, papers in Quebec were unwilling to pay local artists more than what they would pay for a syndicated American strip, which made it hard for local artists to survive, due to the economies of scale that made it cheaper for them to buy the American strips. A few commissioned propaganda works and adaptations of &quot;novels of the homeland&quot; appeared. Rodolphe and Odette Vincent, under the banner of Éditions Vincent, produced some adaptations of adventure novels that they managed to sell to some papers, and were collected into albums by Quebec Éditions de l&#x27;A. B. After the end of World War II, however, Éditions Vincent found themselves unable to compete with the flood of American comics that returned after trade restrictions were loosened. The longest-running of the adventure strips was &quot;Les Aventures de Robert et Roland&quot; by Roberto Wilson, which debuted in 1956 and lasted until 1965.

Paulin Lessard, at the age of sixteen, had his &quot;Les Deux Petits Nains&quot; published in &quot;Le Progrès du Saguenay&quot; in 1947 and 1948. This was the first science fiction BDQ, about two brothers who were only a few centimetres tall, but were endowed with enormous strength, and met with people of other minuscule races.

===Post-war era===
The end of World War II brought with it a loosening in trade restrictions with the US, and American comics came flooding into the province. Whereas in English Canada this had meant the death toll for the local industry, in Quebec local production was paradoxically stimulated by the influx of foreign material. At the height of the &quot;Great Darkness&quot;, a time of conservative government policies mixed with close government ties with the Catholic Church, the violence in many American comics at the time led to a belief that they promoted juvenile delinquency, and as it had in English Canada and the US, the belief prompted the authorities and concerned parents to crack down on comics. Gérard Tessier, with the support of Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger, published &quot;Face à l&#x27;imprimé obscène&quot; in 1955, in the vein of Fredric Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;.

Catholic comics reached their highest point at this time. The &quot;Centrale de la Jeunesse étudiante catholique&quot; (&quot;The Centre for Young Catholic Students&quot;) put out the biweekly &quot;François&quot; beginning in 1943, printing mostly humorous strips. It was joined by &quot;Claire&quot; in 1957, the girls&#x27; version of &quot;François&quot;, which was almost identical in content. &quot;Hérauts&quot; began in 1944, at first printing translations of American strips from the religious &quot;Timeless Topix&quot;. The publication, which had a circulation of 100,000, had a mission to battle the &quot;bad&quot; American comics, and was distributed in schools starting in 1947, which resulted in fewer comics being included in its pages. &quot;Hérauts&quot; was also the first BDQ to be exported to the European market, although only briefly. By the mid-1950s, &quot;Hérauts&quot; was publishing local comics by the likes of Gabriel de Beney and Maurice Petitdidier. Almost all the strips from &quot;Hérauts&quot;, Québécois and American, were reprinted in comics albums during this time, and they also launched a younger version called &quot;Le Petit Hérauts&quot; in 1958, in which Petitdidier&#x27;s &quot;Fanchon et Jean-Lou&quot; was particularly popular.

BDQ of this period flourished only between 1955 and 1960. After this time, the Catholic magazines once again took to reprinting American comics, and the market was flooded with glossy, full-colour Franco-Belgian comics magazines like &quot;Tintin&quot;, &quot;Spirou&quot;, &quot;Vaillant&quot;, &quot;Pif&quot;, and &quot;Pilote&quot;. By the mid-1960s, the Catholic publications were gone.

===Spring of BDQ===
The revolutionary 1960s and the Quiet Revolution in Quebec saw new vigour in BDQ. The so-called &quot;printemps de la BD québécoise&quot; (&quot;Spring of Quebec comics&quot;) is said to have begun in 1968 with the creation of the group Chiendent, who published in &quot;La Presse&quot; and &quot;Dimanche-Magazine&quot;. Jacques Hurtubise (Zyx), Réal Godbout, Gilles Thibault (&quot;Tibo&quot;), and Jacques Boivin were particularly notable cartoonists, and publications appeared with names like &quot;Ma®de in Québec&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Hydrocéphale illustré&quot;, &quot;La Pulpe&quot;, &quot;B.D.&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Écran&quot;. The comics no longer focused on younger audiences, instead seeking confrontation or experimenting with graphics. The first modern Quebec comic book is said to be &quot;Oror 70 (Celle qui en a marre tire)&quot; by André Philibert, which dealt with countercultural topics like what were being seen in the underground comix of Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. During the 1970s, BDQ were sometimes called &quot;BDK&quot;, &quot;bande dessinée kébécoise&quot;.

Numerous short-lived, small press titles popped up here and there throughout the province. The artists who made them set out to challenge society, and the comics abounded in taboos, like sex and drugs. Lack of distribution, irregular publishing scales, and a relatively small market led eventually to the demise of these publications. Albums, on the other hand, had become incredibly popular, and large European publishers began to open Quebec divisions to deal with the demand for titles like &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, &quot;Asterix&quot; and &quot;Blueberry&quot;. Quebec publishers scrambled to get in on the boom, and published a number of albums, many based on TV characters, some aimed at adults.

This period saw an increased interest in Quebec of local comics, and a number of events were first held: the Salon international de la caricature de Montréal added a comic strip section to their annual exhibit in 1971; &quot;Festival de la bande dessinée de Montréal&quot; (&quot;Festival of Comics of Montreal&quot;) was held for four years starting in 1975 at the University of Montreal; and the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal mounted its first major retrospective of Quebec comics, presented at the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France. Richard Langlois developed a course called &quot;Bande dessinée et figuration narrative&quot; in Sherbrooke that was offered in post-secondary schools throughout the province, which sparked a number of other practical and theoretical courses to be offered in colleges and universities. An issue of the literary journal &quot;La Barre du Jour&quot; dedicated an entire 260-page issue to Quebec comics, and certain arts and sociological magazines ran articles on the subject, as well as some popular newspapers and periodicals. A fanzine called &quot;B.D.K.&quot;, published by Michel Ouellette and dedicated exclusively to Quebec comics, ran for three years beginning in 1975. Increasingly over this period, comics became increasingly deeply analyzed, and began to be taken seriously and scholarly as an artform.

In 1979, with the help of an $80,000 grant from the &quot;ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec&quot; (&quot;Quebec Ministry of Cultural Affairs&quot;), Jacques Hurtubise, Pierre Huet and Hélène Fleury would establish the long-lived, satirical &quot;Croc&quot; (&quot;Fang&quot; in French), which published many leading talents of the era, many of whom were able to launch their careers through the magazine&#x27;s help. &quot;Croc&quot; begat another magazine, &quot;Titanic&quot;, dedicated entirely to comics, and in 1987, &quot;Safarir&quot; (a pun, which combines &quot;safari&quot; with &quot;ça fait rire&quot;—&quot;it makes you laugh&quot;), a &quot;Mad&quot;-like publication patterned after the French &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot;, rose in competition with &quot;Croc&quot;, eventually putting the older magazine out of business. By the mid-1980s, a number of professional comics publishers began to flourish.

Adult and Underground comics of the time began to multiply, with notable titles including &quot;Cocktail&quot;, &quot;Tchiize! présente&quot;, &quot;Tchiize! bis&quot;, and the fanzine &quot;Iceberg&quot; appearing in the early 1980s, giving an outlet to young cartoonists like Henriette Valium and Julie Doucet. Fanzines, which had earlier focused on superheroes, now began to feature science fiction instead.

===Since the 1990s===

In Montreal in the 1980s and 1990s, in parallel to mainstream humour magazines, a healthy underground scene developed, and self-published fanzines proliferated. Julie Doucet, Henriette Valium, Luc Giard, Éric Thériault, Gavin McInnes and Siris were among the names that were discovered in the small press publications.

In the 21st century, some Québécois cartoonists who have seen success in Canada and abroad are Michel Rabagliati and his semi-autobiographical &quot;Paul&quot; series, Maryse Dubuc and Delaf&#x27;s &quot;Les Nombrils&quot; (&quot;The Bellybuttons&quot;), aimed at teenaged girls, and Guy Delisle with various travelogue comics. All of these series have seen English translations. An increasing number of cartoonists also took to online webcomics.

Around the turn of the century, the government of Quebec mandated &quot;La Fondation du 9e art&quot; (&quot;The 9th Art Foundation&quot;) to promote francophone cartoonists in North America. There have also emerged events such as the &quot;Festival de la bande dessinée francophone de Québec&quot; in Quebec City and la Zone internationale du neuvième art (ZINA).

==Publication, promotion and distribution==
Comics publications tend to follow the Franco-Belgian model, with books printed as albums with either soft- or hardcovers. When aimed at children, they are usually in full-colour, while comics aimed at adults are often in black-and-white and have softcovers.

Traditionally, comics publishing in Quebec has centred in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke and, since the 1990s, in Gatineau. Fanzines are also produced throughout the province. There are a number of French-language comics publishers based in Quebec, such as Éditions Mille-Îles, La Pastèque, Les 400 coups, Mécanique Générale, and Glénat Québec, the Quebec arm of the France-based publisher Glénat. Translations into English of Québécois comics such as Michel Rabagliati&#x27;s &quot;Paul&quot; series have been published by the English-language, Montreal-based Drawn &amp; Quarterly, and Conundrum Press, also based in Montreal, has put much of its focus on publishing translations of Quebec comics.

The &quot;Prix Bédélys&quot; (&quot;Bédélys Prize&quot;) has been awarded to French language comics since 2000. It comes with bursaries for the &quot;Prix Bédélys Québec&quot; for Best Book from Quebec and the &quot;Prix Bédélys Fanzine&quot;. The Joe Shuster Awards are open to all Canadian comics in any language, not limited to either French or English, and a number of francophone comics and publishers have won the awards.

The government of Quebec mandated &quot;La Fondation du 9e art&quot; (&quot;The 9th Art Foundation&quot;) to promote francophone cartoonists in North America. Events such as the &quot;Festival de la bande dessinée francophone de Québec&quot; in Quebec City and &quot;la Zone internationale du neuvième art&quot; (&quot;ZINA&quot;) celebrate francophone comics in Quebec.

<text>Taxicab geometry or Manhattan geometry is geometry where the familiar Euclidean distance is ignored, and the distance between two points is instead defined to be the sum of the absolute differences of their respective Cartesian coordinates, a distance function (or metric) called the &quot;taxicab distance&quot;, &quot;Manhattan distance&quot;, or &quot;city block distance&quot;. The name refers to the island of Manhattan, or generically any planned city with a rectangular grid of streets, in which a taxicab can only travel along grid directions. In taxicab geometry, the distance between any two points equals the length of their shortest grid path. This different definition of distance also leads to a different definition of the length of a curve, for which a line segment between any two points has the same length as a grid path between those points rather than its Euclidean length.

The taxicab distance is also sometimes known as &quot;rectilinear distance&quot; or distance (see &quot;Lp&quot; space). This geometry has been used in regression analysis since the 18th century, and is often referred to as LASSO. Its geometric interpretation dates to non-Euclidean geometry of the 19th century and is due to Hermann Minkowski.

In the two-dimensional real coordinate space formula_1, the taxicab distance between two points formula_2 and formula_3 is formula_4. That is, it is the sum of the absolute values of the differences in both coordinates.

== Formal definition ==
The taxicab distance, formula_5, between two points formula_6 in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real coordinate space with fixed Cartesian coordinate system, is the sum of the lengths of the projections of the line segment between the points onto the coordinate axes. More formally,formula_7For example, in formula_8, the taxicab distance between formula_9 and formula_10 is formula_11

== History ==
The &quot;L&quot;1 metric was used in regression analysis, as a measure of goodness of fit, in 1757 by Roger Joseph Boscovich. The interpretation of it as a distance between points in a geometric space dates to the late 19th century and the development of non-Euclidean geometries. Notably it appeared in 1910 in the works of both Frigyes Riesz and Hermann Minkowski. The formalization of &quot;L&quot;p spaces, which include taxicab geometry as a special case, is credited to Riesz. In developing the geometry of numbers, Hermann Minkowski established his Minkowski inequality, stating that these spaces define normed vector spaces.

The name &quot;taxicab geometry&quot; was introduced by Karl Menger in a 1952 booklet &quot;You Will Like Geometry&quot;, accompanying a geometry exhibit intended for the general public at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

== Properties ==
Thought of as an additional structure layered on Euclidean space, taxicab distance depends on the orientation of the coordinate system and is changed by Euclidean rotation of the space, but is unaffected by translation or axis-aligned reflections. Taxicab geometry satisfies all of Hilbert&#x27;s axioms (a formalization of Euclidean geometry) except that the congruence of angles cannot be defined to precisely match the Euclidean concept, and under plausible definitions of congruent taxicab angles, the side-angle-side axiom is not satisfied as in general triangles with two taxicab-congruent sides and a taxicab-congruent angle between them are not congruent triangles.

=== Spheres ===
In any metric space, a sphere is a set of points at a fixed distance, the &quot;radius&quot;, from a specific &quot;center&quot; point. Whereas a Euclidean sphere is round and rotationally symmetric, under the taxicab distance, the shape of a sphere is a cross-polytope, the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional generalization of a regular octahedron, whose points formula_12 satisfy the equation:

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the center and &quot;r&quot; is the radius. Points formula_12 on the unit sphere, a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin, satisfy the equation formula_16

In two dimensional taxicab geometry, the sphere (called a &quot;circle&quot;) is a square oriented diagonally to the coordinate axes. The image to the right shows in red the set of all points on a square grid with a fixed distance from the blue center. As the grid is made finer, the red points become more numerous, and in the limit tend to a continuous tilted square. Each side has taxicab length 2&quot;r&quot;, so the circumference is 8&quot;r&quot;. Thus, in taxicab geometry, the value of the analog of the circle constant π, the ratio of circumference to diameter, is equal to 4. 

A closed &quot;ball&quot; (or closed &quot;disk&quot; in the 2-dimensional case) is a filled-in sphere, the set of points at distance less than or equal to the radius from a specific center. For cellular automata on a square grid, a taxicab disk is the von Neumann neighborhood of range &quot;r&quot; of its center.

A circle of radius &quot;r&quot; for the Chebyshev distance (L∞ metric) on a plane is also a square with side length 2&quot;r&quot; parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L1 and L∞ metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.

Whenever each pair in a collection of these circles has a nonempty intersection, there exists an intersection point for the whole collection; therefore, the Manhattan distance forms an injective metric space.

=== Arc length ===
Let formula_17 be a continuously differentiable function. Let formula_18 be the taxicab arc length of the graph of formula_19 on some interval formula_20. Take a partition of the interval into equal infinitesimal subintervals, and let formula_21 be the taxicab length of the formula_22 subarc. Then

formula_23

By the mean value theorem, there exists some point formula_24 between formula_25 and formula_26 such that formula_27. Then the previous equation can be written

formula_28

Then formula_29 is given as the sum of every partition of formula_29 on formula_20 as they get arbitrarily small.formula_32
To test this, take the taxicab circle of radius formula_33 centered at the origin. Its curve in the first quadrant is given by formula_34 whose length is

formula_35

Multiplying this value by formula_36 to account for the remaining quadrants gives formula_37, which agrees with the circumference of a taxicab circle. Now take the Euclidean circle of radius formula_33 centered at the origin, which is given by formula_39. Its arc length in the first quadrant is given by

formula_40

Accounting for the remaining quadrants gives formula_41 again. Therefore, the circumference of the taxicab circle and the Euclidean circle in the taxicab metric are equal. In fact, for any function formula_19 that is monotonic and differentiable with a continuous derivative over an interval formula_20, the arc length of formula_19 over formula_45 is formula_46.

=== Triangle congruence ===
Two triangles are congruent if and only if three corresponding sides are equal in distance and three corresponding angles are equal in measure. There are several theorems that guarantee triangle congruence in Euclidean geometry, namely Angle-Angle-Side (AAS), Angle-Side-Angle (ASA), Side-Angle-Side (SAS), and Side-Side-Side (SSS). In taxicab geometry, however, only SASAS guarantees triangle congruence.

Take, for example, two right isosceles taxicab triangles whose angles measure 45-90-45. The two legs of both triangles have a taxicab length 2, but the hypotenuses are not congruent. This counterexample eliminates AAS, ASA, and SAS. It also eliminates AASS, AAAS, and even ASASA. Having three congruent angles and two sides does not guarantee triangle congruence in taxicab geometry. Therefore, the only triangle congruence theorem in taxicab geometry is SASAS, where all three corresponding sides must be congruent and at least two corresponding angles must be congruent. This result is mainly due to the fact that the length of a line segment depends on its orientation in taxicab geometry.

== Applications ==

=== Compressed sensing ===
In solving an underdetermined system of linear equations, the regularization term for the parameter vector is expressed in terms of the formula_47 norm (taxicab geometry) of the vector. This approach appears in the signal recovery framework called compressed sensing.

=== Differences of frequency distributions ===
Taxicab geometry can be used to assess the differences in discrete frequency distributions. For example, in RNA splicing positional distributions of hexamers, which plot the probability of each hexamer appearing at each given nucleotide near a splice site, can be compared with L1-distance. Each position distribution can be represented as a vector where each entry represents the likelihood of the hexamer starting at a certain nucleotide. A large L1-distance between the two vectors indicates a significant difference in the nature of the distributions while a small distance denotes similarly shaped distributions. This is equivalent to measuring the area between the two distribution curves because the area of each segment is the absolute difference between the two curves&#x27; likelihoods at that point. When summed together for all segments, it provides the same measure as L1-distance.

<text>The term Beiyang (; pinyin: Běiyáng; Wade-Giles: Peiyang) literally means Northern Ocean. Initially a purely geographic term, it originated toward the end of the Qing dynasty, and it referred to the coastal provinces of Zhili (Traditional Chinese:直隸, Simplified Chinese: 直隶, pinyin: Zhílì, today&#x27;s Hebei), Shandong and Liaoning that bordered the Yellow Sea (itself a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean) and surrounded the imperial capital of Beijing (then known as Peking).

The term later acquired a political significance, denoting the imperial heartland. The position of Minister of Beiyang (北洋通商大臣) in the late Qing Dynasty was held by the Viceroy of Zhili, whose main responsibilities were trade relations and occasionally foreign affairs.

<text>Sony Pictures Classics Inc. is an American independent film production and distribution company that is a division of Sony Pictures. It was founded in 1992 by former Orion Classics heads Michael Barker, Tom Bernard and Marcie Bloom. It distributes, produces and acquires specialty films such as documentaries, independent and arthouse films in the United States and internationally. As of 2015, Barker and Bernard are co-presidents of the division, which is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).

== History ==

Sony Pictures Classics (SPC) was formed in 1992 by Michael Barker, Tom Bernard and Marcie Bloom, and set up as an autonomous division of Sony Pictures to produce, acquire and/or distribute independent films from the United States and internationally.

It has released films that have won 37 Academy Awards and received 155 nominations, including Best Picture nominations for &quot;I’m Still Here&quot;, &quot;The Father&quot;, &quot;Call Me By Your Name&quot;, &quot;Whiplash&quot;, &quot;Amour&quot;, &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;, &quot;An Education&quot;, &quot;Capote&quot;, &quot;Howards End&quot;, and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.

SPC has a history of making reasonable investments for small films, and getting a decent return. It has a history of not overspending. Its largest commercial success of the 2010s is Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011), which grossed over $56 million in the U.S., becoming Allen&#x27;s highest-grossing film ever in the United States.

SPC has been a pioneer in theatrical distribution. In 2001 championed the Chinese-language film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, which earned the most Oscar nominations ever for a non-English-language film, and win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and a Golden Globe in 2001. The film earned over $213 million worldwide on a $17 million budget, including $128 million in the U.S. as a Sony Pictures Classics release.

In 2006, SPC promoted &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; to an Oscar and BAFTA, after it was rejected by the Cannes, Berlin, Venice and New York Film Festivals.

SPC occasionally agrees to release films for Sony&#x27;s other film divisions; however, under its structure within Sony, none of the other divisions (including the parent company) can force SPC to release any film it does not want to release.

<text>Irish coffee () is a caffeinated alcoholic drink consisting of Irish whiskey, hot coffee and sugar, which has been stirred and topped with cream (sometimes cream liqueur). The coffee is drunk through the cream.

==Origin==
Different variations of coffee cocktails pre-date the now-classic Irish coffee by at least 100 years.

From the mid-19th century, the and the were served in Viennese coffee houses; both were coffee cocktails served in glass, topped with whipped cream. The former was also known in northern Germany and Denmark around that time. Around 1900, the coffee cocktail menu in the Viennese cafés also included , &quot;Maria Theresia&quot;, and a handful of other variations on the theme.

In 19th-century France, a mixture of coffee and spirits was called a &quot;gloria&quot;.
* &quot;&quot; (Balzac, &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, 1834, I.)
* &quot;&quot; (Flaubert, &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, 1857.)

Several places claim to have developed the modern recipe in the 1950s. One version is attributed to a Joe Sheridan, head chef at the restaurant and coffee shop in the Foynes Airbase flying boat terminal (about from present-day Shannon Airport, County Clare). In 1942 or 1943, he added whiskey to the coffee of some disembarking passengers.

Stanton Delaplane, a travel writer for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, maintains he brought Irish coffee to the United States after drinking it at Shannon Airport. His version is that he worked with the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco to start serving it on November 10, 1952. Sheridan later emigrated to work at the Buena Vista Cafe.

==Preparation==
Irish whiskey and at least one level teaspoon of sugar are poured over black coffee and stirred in until fully dissolved. Thick cream is carefully poured over the back of a spoon initially held just above the surface of the coffee and gradually raised a little until the entire layer is floated.

== Variations ==
In 1988, the National Standards Authority of Ireland published Irish Standard I.S. 417: Irish Coffee. The standard has been cancelled at least as of 2020.

Although whiskey, coffee and cream are the basic ingredients in all Irish coffee, there are variations in preparation: the choice of coffee and the methods used for brewing it differ significantly. The use of espresso machines or fully automatic coffee brewers is now typical: the coffee is either a caffè americano (espresso diluted with hot water) or some kind of filter coffee, often made using a coffee capsule.

The cream used in some bars to make what is sold as &quot;Irish coffee&quot; is sometimes sprayed from a can. Some bartenders gently shake fresh cream to achieve a smooth layer on top of the coffee.

In Spain, Irish coffee (&quot;café irlandés&quot;) is sometimes served with a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on top; special devices are sold for making it.

Some bars in Southeast Asia serve a cocktail of iced coffee and whiskey, sometimes without cream, under the name &quot;Irish coffee&quot;.

Many drinks of hot coffee with a distilled spirit, and cream floated on top—liqueur coffees—are given names derived from Irish coffee, although the names are not standardised. Irish cream coffee (also known as Baileys coffee) can be considered a variant of Irish coffee, but involves the use of Irish cream as a &quot;pre-mixed&quot; substitute for the whisky, cream and sugar. Jamaican coffee would be expected to be made with rum; Highland coffee, also called Gaelic coffee, with Scotch whisky; Russian coffee with vodka; and Mexican coffee with tequila.

<doc id="408362" wikidata="Q207601" url="?curid=408362" title="American Music Awards">
<text>The American Music Awards (AMAs) is an annual American music awards show produced by Dick Clark Productions since 1974. Nominees are selected on commercial performance, such as sales and airplay. Winners are determined by a poll of the public and fans, who can vote through the AMAs website. 

The event originally aired on ABC, after the network&#x27;s contract to air the Grammy Awards expired; its contract expired after the 2022 ceremony, putting the American Music Awards on hiatus. In March 2024, it was announced that the AMAs would move to CBS as part of a package with its rights to broadcast the now DCP-owned Golden Globe Awards. The event remained on hiatus for 2024 (with CBS airing a 50th anniversary special in October of that year), ahead of a planned return in 2025 with a new May scheduling.

== Conception ==
The AMAs was created by Dick Clark in 1973 to compete with the Grammy Awards after the move of that year&#x27;s show to Nashville, Tennessee led to CBS (which has broadcast all Grammy Award shows since then) picking up the Grammy telecasts after its first two in 1971 and 1972 were broadcast on ABC. In 2014, American network Telemundo acquired the rights to produce a Spanish-language version of the American Music Awards and launched the Latin American Music Awards in 2015.

Nominations are selected based on commercial performance, such as sales and airplay. Winners have been determined by a poll of the public and fans, who can vote through the AMAs website, while nominations have remained based on sales, airplay, now including activity on social networks, and video viewing. Before 2010, had nominations based only on sales and airplay and nominated every work, even if old. The Grammys have nominations based on vote of the Academy and only nominate a work from their eligibility period that changes often.

The award statuette is manufactured by New York firm Society Awards.

== History ==
The hosts for the first AMAs were Helen Reddy, Roger Miller, and Smokey Robinson. Reddy not only hosted the show but also became the first artist to win an AMA for Favorite Pop/Rock Female artist. For the first two decades, the AMAs had multiple hosts, each representing a genre of music. For instance, Glen Campbell, who co-hosted the AMAs five times, would host the country portion, while other artists would co-host to represent their genre. In recent years, however, there has been a single host.

In 1991, Keenen Ivory Wayans became the first Hollywood actor to host the AMAs.

From its inception in 1974 through 2003, the AMAs were held in mid- to late-January, but were moved to November (usually the Sunday before Thanksgiving) beginning in late 2003 so it would prevent the ceremony to further compete with other major awards shows (such as the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards) and allows for ABC to have a well-rated awards show during November sweeps.

For the 2008 awards, Jimmy Kimmel hosted for his fifth year, tying with Glen Campbell for the most AMAs hosted or co-hosted. From 2009–2012, there was no host. Instead, the AMAs followed the Grammys&#x27; lead in having various celebrities give introductions. However, rapper Pitbull hosted the 2013 ceremony and 2014 ceremony. Jennifer Lopez hosted the 2015 show. Gigi Hadid and Jay Pharoah hosted the 2016 show. Tracee Ellis Ross hosted the show in 2017 and 2018. Ciara hosted the 2019 show.

Between 2012 and 2014, the American Music Awards used the lock screen wallpaper of Samsung Galaxy smartphones rather than envelopes to reveal winners, as part of a sponsorship by Samsung Electronics. A magnetic screen cover on each phone kept the wallpaper image with the winner&#x27;s name secret until opened.

In August 2018, Dick Clark Productions announced a two-year sponsorship and content partnership with YouTube Music. However, this partnership seemed to have lasted only for the 2018 ceremony, as there was no mention of the YouTube Music partnership in the 2019 show.

In March 2023, it was announced that the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, which are also produced by DCP via co-owned &quot;Billboard&quot;, had been moved from May to the November scheduling that was typically occupied by the American Music Awards, leading to speculation that the AMAs would be discontinued in order to focus on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, or at the very least cancelled for 2023 so it could move to May in its place. It was reported that the broadcast rights for both events (which had been held by NBC and ABC respectively) would also be shopped; the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards moved to an online only event in November 2023.

In March 2024, it was announced that CBS had acquired the rights to broadcast the AMAs under a multi-year deal of unspecified length. The rights were bundled with CBS&#x27;s five-year agreement to televise the Golden Globe Awards, whose telecast has historically been produced by DCP, and whose assets had been acquired by DCP in 2023. It was not stated whether the contract is for the same period as the Golden Globes agreement. 

The AMAs continued to be on hiatus for 2024, with a return scheduled for May 2025. In lieu of a 2024 ceremony, a televised special honoring the AMAs&#x27; 50th anniversary was aired by CBS on October 6, 2024, including performances and retrospectives paying tribute to the ceremony&#x27;s history and memorable moments. Ratings for the special were up from the last ceremony aired on ABC, with an average of 6.1 million viewers. In February 2025, it was announced that the 51st American Music Awards would air on May 26, 2025 on CBS.

<text>New Line Productions, Inc., doing business as New Line Cinema, is an American film and television production company that is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, a division of the &quot;Big Five&quot; film studio Warner Bros., which, in turn, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Founded on June 18, 1967 by Robert Shaye in New York City as an independent film distribution company, it is now headquartered in Burbank, California, and, since 2008, it has been operating as a unit of Warner Bros. Pictures.

It became a film studio after acquired by Turner Broadcasting System in 1994; Turner later merged with Time Warner Entertainment (later known as WarnerMedia from 2018 to 2022, and Warner Bros. Discovery since 2022) in 1996, and New Line was merged with Warner Bros. Pictures in 2008. The studio has been nicknamed &quot;The House that Freddy Built&quot; due to the success of the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series. However, its most successful property was a film adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien with considerable commercial success and numerous Academy Awards.

==History==
===From founding to 1984===

New Line Cinema was established in 1967 by the then 27-year-old Robert Shaye as a film distribution company, supplying foreign and art films for college campuses in the United States. Shaye operated New Line Cinema&#x27;s offices out of his apartment at 14th Street and Second Avenue in New York City. One of the company&#x27;s early successes was its distribution of the 1936 anti-cannabis propaganda film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;, which became a cult hit on American college campuses in the early 1970s. New Line also released many classic foreign-language films, like &quot;Stay As You Are&quot;, &quot;Immoral Tales&quot; and &quot;Get Out Your Handkerchiefs&quot; (which became the first New Line film to win an Oscar). The studio has also released many of the films of John Waters.

In 1976, New Line Cinema secured funding to produce its first full-length feature, &quot;Stunts&quot; (1977), directed by Mark L. Lester. Although not considered a critical success, the film performed well commercially on the international market and on television.

In 1980, Shaye&#x27;s law school classmate Michael Lynne became outside counsel and adviser to the company and renegotiated its debt.

In 1983, Bryanston Distributing Company, the company that first distributed the original &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;, lost the rights to that film, and the rights reverted to the original owners. New Line Cinema bought the rights and re-released the film to theatres that same year. It became very successful for the studio.

New Line Cinema expanded its film production in the early 1980s, producing or co-producing films including &quot;Polyester&quot;, directed by John Waters, and &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. &quot;Polyester&quot; was one of the first films to introduce a novelty cinema experience named Odorama, where members of the audience were provided with a set of &quot;scratch and sniff&quot; cards to be scratched and sniffed at specific times during the film, which provided an additional sensory connection to the viewed image. In 1983, Lynne joined the board. In 1984, Dawn Altyn and Jeff Youngs joined New Line Cinema, respectively as sales manager, eastern and southern divisions of New Line Distribution, and national print controller of the studio, to distribute new projects.

===&quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;===
&quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; was produced and released by New Line Cinema in 1984. The resulting franchise was New Line Cinema&#x27;s first commercially successful series, leading the company to be nicknamed &quot;The House that Freddy Built&quot;. The film was made on a budget of $1.8 million and grossed over $57 million. A year later, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was released, and grossed $3.3 million in its first three days of release and over $30 million at the US box office. In 1986, the company went public, and held 1,613,000 shares of common stock. 

With the success of the &quot;Elm Street&quot; franchise, New Line Cinema made moves to expand their business. This included a revamping of their distribution network, the sale of their films into broadcast syndication and pay-TV (via Embassy Communications and Universal Pay Television, respectively), and the creation of an international distribution arm.

The third film in the series, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, was released in 1987, the studio&#x27;s first national release, and opened at number one, grossing $8.9 million for the weekend, a record for an independent film at the time, and went on to gross almost $45 million at the US box office. A further six films have been made. The first six grossed $500 million worldwide and the next three $250 million, for a total of $750 million.

===&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and expansion===
In 1990, Lynne became president and chief operating officer, with Shaye as chairman and chief executive officer. The same year, New Line Cinema released &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; which became the highest-grossing independent film of all-time with a gross of $135 million in the United States and Canada, until it was surpassed by &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999). It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; (1991) which was the second highest-grossing with a gross of $78 million in the United States and Canada. A third, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot; followed in 1993.

In November 1990, New Line Cinema purchased a 52% stake in the television production company RHI Entertainment (now Halcyon Studios), which would later be sold to Hallmark Cards in 1994.

In early 1991, Fine Line Features was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary headed by Ira Deutchman and released films including Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; and Gus van Sant&#x27;s &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. Halfway through the year, Carolco Pictures, entered into a joint venture with New Line Cinema to start Seven Arts, a distribution company which primarily released much of Carolco&#x27;s low-budget output. In 1997, &quot;Shine&quot; received the studio&#x27;s first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture and their second film to win an Academy Award with Geoffrey Rush&#x27;s win for Academy Award for Best Actor.

In May 1991, New Line Cinema purchased the home video and foreign rights to 600 films held by Sultan Entertainment Holdings (a.k.a. Nelson Entertainment). The deal also included an 11-film distribution deal with Castle Rock Entertainment. On November 27, 1991, New Line Cinema purchased Sultan outright.

In 1992, Michael De Luca became executive vice-president and chief executive officer of the production unit.

===Acquisition by Turner and Time Warner===
On January 28, 1994, New Line Cinema was acquired by the Turner Broadcasting System for $500 million, which later merged with Time Warner Entertainment in 1996. New Line Cinema was kept as its own separate entity, while fellow Turner-owned studios Hanna-Barbera Productions and Castle Rock Entertainment eventually became units of Warner Bros.

During its time as an entity separate from Warner Bros., New Line Cinema continued to operate several divisions, including theatrical distribution, marketing and home video.

The company&#x27;s fortunes took a downturn in 1996 after losses on &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; and &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;. 

===&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;-era===
New Line Cinema produced &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy which became their most successful films to date, grossing over $2.9 billion worldwide. The films were nominated for 30 Academy Awards, including nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture for each film, and won 17, with the final picture, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003) winning a (joint) record eleven, including Best Picture, as well as being the second highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.

Despite the success of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, &quot;Town and Country&quot; (2001) generated a loss of $100 million and De Luca left as production head to be replaced by Toby Emmerich. In 2001, Shaye and Lynne became co-chairmen and co-CEO.

The studio was also a partner in founding a new distribution company named Picturehouse in 2005. Specializing in independent film, Picturehouse was formed by Bob Berney, who left distributor Newmarket Films, New Line Cinema, who folded their Fine Line division into Picturehouse, and HBO Films, a division of HBO and a subsidiary of Time Warner, who was interested in getting into the theatrical film business.

===Merger with Warner Bros. and Warner Bros.-era===

On February 28, 2008, Time Warner&#x27;s CEO at the time, Jeffrey Bewkes, announced that New Line Cinema would be shut down as a separately operated studio. Shaye and Lynne said that they would step down with a letter to their employees. They promised, however, along with Time Warner and Jeffery Bewkes, that the company would continue to operate its financing, producing, marketing and distributing operations of its own films, but would do so as a part of Warner Bros. and be a smaller studio, releasing a smaller number of films than in past years. The box office disappointment of &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (2007) was largely blamed for the decision, in which New Line Cinema spent $180 million on its development, yet it only grossed $70 million in the United States market. In March, Emmerich became president and chief operating officer, whilst both founders Robert Shaye and Michael Lynne had left the company.

On May 8, 2008, it was announced that Picturehouse would shut down in the fall. Berney later bought the Picturehouse trademarks from Warner Bros. and relaunched the company in 2013.

New Line Cinema moved from its long-time headquarters on Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles in June 2014 to Warner Bros.&#x27; lot Building 76, formerly used by Legendary Entertainment, a former Warner Bros. film co-financier. The last film released by New Line Cinema as a free-standing company was the Will Ferrell film &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;.

Since 2016, New Line Cinema had been producing its own television series (New Line Television had been folded into Warner Bros. Television in 2008).

As for the company&#x27;s future, Alan Horn, the Warner Bros. president at the time of the consolidation, stated, &quot;There&#x27;s no budget number required. They&#x27;ll be doing about six per year, though the number may go from four to seven; it&#x27;s not going to be 10.&quot; As to content, &quot;New Line will not just be doing genre [...] There&#x27;s no mandate to make a particular kind of movie.&quot;

<doc id="408381" wikidata="Q388768" url="?curid=408381" title="Anal beads">
<text>Anal beads are a sex toy consisting of multiple balls attached in series. Individual balls are continuously inserted through the anus into the rectum and then removed with varying speeds depending on the desired effect. The main use of anal beads are for sexual stimulation.

== Design ==
Anal beads are available in many sizes, with individual beads measuring from 25 mm in diameter to 125 mm in diameter or larger. Most users enjoy beads of approximately 45 mm, but those more adventurous or with experience may try larger sizes. Anal beads are commonly made of silicone, plastic, rubber, latex, glass, or metal, and normally end with a ring or similar handle designed for pulling. The purpose of this ring is to prevent the beads from becoming fully lodged in the rectum and to make the toy easier to remove. The beads may either be joined flexibly, requiring individual insertion or by a semi-rigid thin shaft, allowing anal insertion in a single motion.

The many nerve endings of the sphincter provide arousal both during insertion and removal, while larger beads may create a feeling of pressure in the rectum. Removing anal beads at the point of orgasm heightens sensations, leading to a much stronger orgasm.

Some anal beads are enhanced with vibration technology. Certain models can be remote controlled or act as IoT devices.

== Use ==
Anal beads are commonly incorporated during anal sex, worship of the buttocks, genital or anal masturbation, or any activity involving the buttocks, anus, or the anal area.

As with all anal sexual activity, the anal beads and the rectum should be well-lubricated with a sexual lubricant intended for anal sex. It is important to do this, as the rectum can be easily ripped, torn, or injured. Silicone-based lubricants should not be used with silicone anal beads, as the lubricant will erode the beads. Anal sex toys should be well washed with warm soapy water and left to dry naturally after use. Alternatively, they can be placed inside a condom, which is recommended if they are shared with others.

Care must also be taken to count the beads before and after use to ensure that they are all removed from the anus, as strings have reportedly broken during intense rectal movements.

== Safety ==
If the beads are threaded onto a string, which is a porous material, they cannot be fully disinfected. Anal beads should not be shared between users without using a physical barrier, such as a latex or neoprene condom, to prevent the transfer of feces. Sharing unsterilized anal toys can expose users to various sexually transmitted diseases. Anal beads that have been inserted into an anus should not be inserted into a vagina, as this causes yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, as well as various sexually transmitted diseases.

== In popular culture ==

=== &quot;South Park&quot; ===
Anal beads serve as the primary weapon for one of the priests in the critically acclaimed 2017 &quot;South Park&quot; role-playing video game &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot;.

=== &quot;Made of Honor&quot; ===
In the 2008 romantic comedy &quot;Made of Honor&quot;, starring Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan, in the scene where Tom (played by Dempsey), the &quot;man&quot; of honor, throws a bridal shower for Hannah (played by Monaghan), Tom unknowingly hires a lady who sells sex toys. Hannah&#x27;s grandma Pearl (played by Selma Stern) asks, &quot;What are these?&quot; and picks up glow-in-the-dark &quot;thunder beads&quot; (which are anal beads) and wears them as a necklace around her neck during the rest of the scene and even during the wedding.

=== Carlsen–Niemann cheating controversy ===

In the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, a prestigious chess tournament, reigning World Champion Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the tournament after implying that the opponent he lost to, Hans Niemann, was cheating. An internet meme, first propagated as a joke in grandmaster Eric Hansen&#x27;s Twitch chat, suggested that Niemann was cheating using anal beads that vibrated the computer-suggested move via Morse Code. The meme spread throughout the internet, even appearing on late-night talk shows such as &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show with Trevor Noah&quot;.

<doc id="408384" wikidata="Q155616" url="?curid=408384" title="House of Glücksburg">
<text>The House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, also known by its short name as the House of Glücksburg, is the senior surviving branch of the German House of Oldenburg, one of Europe&#x27;s oldest royal houses. Oldenburg house members have reigned at various times in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Greece, several northern German states, Russia and the United Kingdom. It takes its name from the family seat in Glücksburg, a small town in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

Current monarchs King Harald V of Norway and King Charles III of the United Kingdom, as well as the former Queen of Denmark Margrethe II and former queens consort Anne-Marie of Greece and Sofía of Spain, are patrilineal members of cadet branches of the House of Glücksburg.

The present senior member of the House of Oldenburg and the House of Glücksburg and traditional heir to the family&#x27;s ancestral lands, including Glücksburg itself, is Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein (born 1985), who heads the foundation that owns the family&#x27;s ancestral seat, Glücksburg Castle.

== Etymology ==
&quot;House of Glücksburg&quot; is the shortened form of &quot;House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg&quot;a collateral branch of the House of Oldenburg. The house derives its name from two regions and two towns on the Jutland Peninsula.

The two regions of Schleswig and Holstein are divided by the Eider River. While Schleswig for centuries constituted the southernmost region of Denmark, Holstein historically has been the northernmost area within the Holy Roman Empire. The northern border of Holstein along the Eider had already formed the northern border of Francia and the Carolingian Empire, after Emperor Charlemagne upon the Saxon Wars reached an agreement with King Hemming of Denmark in 811. The lands of Schleswig beyond the river remained a fief of the Danish Crown, while Holstein became an integral part of East Francia, the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire. Even earlier, the Eider had already been the border river between Saxons and Polabian Slavs to the south, and Danes and North Frisians to the north. This is evidenced in the largely Slavic-derived toponomy in Eastern Holstein, as opposed to the many Danish-derived place names in Schleswig including Southern Schleswig. Since the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites, Schleswig has been divided between Denmark (Northern Schleswig), and Germany (Southern Schleswig).

The town of Sønderborgthe German name of which is &quot;Sonderburg&quot;is located on the northern shores of the Flensburg Firth in Denmark (Northern Schleswig), while Glücksburg (Ostsee) lies on the southern shores of the firth in Germany (Southern Schleswig). The &quot;Ostsee&quot; suffix means &quot;Baltic Sea&quot; (&quot;East Sea&quot;).

Since Glücksburg Castle is the ancestral seat of the house, the house is mostly shortened to just &quot;House of Glücksburg&quot;. It is also spelled &quot;House of Glücksborg&quot; (the name of Glücksburg in the local Low German dialect) or &quot;House of Lyksborg&quot; (the Danish name of Glücksburg).

The literal translation of &quot;Glücksburg&quot; is &quot;Luck&#x27;s Castle&quot; (Glück = luck; Burg = castle). Glücksburg is officially bilingual and since 2016, there are German/Danish city limit signs in the town.

==History==

Glücksburg is a small coastal town on the German southern side of the fjord of Flensburg that divides Germany from Denmark. In 1460, Glücksburg came, as part of the conjoined Dano-German duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, to Count Christian of Oldenburg whom, in 1448, the Danes had elected their king as Christian I, the Norwegians likewise taking him as their hereditary king in 1450.

In 1564, Christian I&#x27;s great-grandson, King Frederick II, in re-distributing Schleswig and Holstein&#x27;s fiefs, retained some lands for his own senior royal line while allocating Glücksburg to his brother Duke John the Younger (1545–1622), along with Sønderborg, in appanage. John&#x27;s heirs further sub-divided their share and created, among other branches, a line of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg dukes at Beck (an estate near Minden bought by the family in 1605), who remained vassals of Denmark&#x27;s kings.

By 1825, the castle of Glücksburg had returned to the Danish crown (from another ducal branch called Glücksburg, extinct in 1779) and was given that year by King Frederick VI, along with a new ducal title, to his kinsman Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck. Frederick suffixed the territorial designation to the ducal title he already held, in lieu of &quot;Beck&quot; (an estate the family had, in fact, sold in 1745). Thus emerged the extant &quot;Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg&quot;.

The Danish line of Oldenburg kings died out in 1863, and the elder line of the Schleswig-Holstein family became extinct with the death of the last Augustenburg duke in 1931. Thereafter, the House of Glücksburg became the senior surviving line of the House of Oldenburg. Another cadet line of Oldenburgs, the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp, consisted of two branches which held onto sovereignty into the 20th century. But members of the Romanov line were executed in or exiled from their Russian Empire in 1917, while the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg was abolished in 1918, although its dynastic line survives.

Neither the Dukes of Beck nor of Glücksburg had been sovereign rulers; they held their lands in fief from the ruling Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein, i.e. the Kings of Denmark and (until 1773) the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp.

Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the fourth son of Duke Friedrich of Glücksburg, was recognized in the London Protocol of 1852 as successor to the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark. He became King of Denmark as Christian IX on 15 November 1863.

Prince Vilhelm, the second son of Crown Prince Christian and Crown Princess Luise, was elected King of the Hellenes on 30 March 1863, succeeding the ousted Wittelsbach Otto of Greece and reigning under the name George I.

Prince Carl, the second son of Frederick VIII of Denmark, Christian IX&#x27;s eldest son, became King of Norway on 18 November 1905 as Haakon VII.

Christian IX&#x27;s daughters, Alexandra and Dagmar (as &quot;Maria Feodorovna&quot;) became the consorts of, respectively, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and Emperor Alexander III of Russia. As a result, by 1914 descendants of King Christian IX held the crowns of several European realms, and he became known as the &quot;Father-in-law of Europe&quot;.

Christian IX&#x27;s older brother inherited formal headship of the family as Karl, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, followed by their brother Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. It is his descendants who now represent the senior line of the Schleswig-Holstein branch of the House of Oldenburg, with Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein, as its current head.

== Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg ==

The Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg constitute the senior male line of the branch. They hold the headship by primogeniture of the cadet house of Glücksburg. The headship by agnatic primogeniture of the entire House of Oldenburg is held by Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein.

The heir apparent is Prince Alfred of Schleswig-Holstein (born 2019).

== Denmark ==


In 1852, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg became heir-presumptive to the Kingdom of Denmark, and in 1863, he ascended the throne. He was the fourth son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, whose elder brother (and male-line descendants) retained the Glücksburg dukedom. The Danish royal family still calls itself Glücksborg, using a slightly Danicized form of Glücksburg.

== Greece ==

In 1863 and with the name George I, Prince Wilhelm of Denmark was elected King of the Hellenes on the recommendation of Europe&#x27;s Great Powers. He was the second son of King Christian IX of Denmark.

The Hellenic constitutional monarchy was usurped in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by a military junta in 1967 and the royal family fled into exile. The monarchy was abolished in 1973. After the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1974, 69.18% of votes recorded in a republic referendum were against the restoration of the monarchy.

As of 2024, the family has assumed the last name &quot;De Grèce&quot; (; &quot;of Greece&quot;), first used by Greek author and dynast Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark for his pen name as &quot;Michel de Grèce&quot;, as the only one familiar to them.

== Norway ==


In 1905, Prince Carl of Denmark became Norway&#x27;s first independent monarch in 518 years, taking the regnal name Haakon VII. His father was King Frederick VIII of Denmark, and one of his uncles was King George I of Greece.

The heir apparent is Crown Prince Haakon of Norway (born 1973). See the present line of succession.

== Iceland ==


In 1918, Iceland was elevated from an autonomous Danish province to a separate Kingdom of Iceland. Christian X of Denmark was henceforth King of Denmark and Iceland until 1944, when Iceland dissolved the personal union between the two countries and became a republic.

The heir apparent was his son, Frederik IX of Denmark (1899–1972).

== United Kingdom ==

In 1947, Philip Mountbatten married Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). Born into the house of Glücksburg as a prince of Denmark and Greece, he later relinquished these titles and was created Duke of Edinburgh by his father-in-law, King George VI of the United Kingdom. 
The heir apparent is Charles&#x27;s elder son William, Prince of Wales (born 1982). See the present line of succession.

: Charles is agnatically descended from the House of Glücksburg via his father. However, he reigns as a member of the House of Windsor.
: Also Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.
: Also Earl of Chester.
: Also Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich.
: Also King of Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Head of the Commonwealth.

<text>The Free National Movement (abbreviated FNM) is a political party in the Bahamas formed in the early 1970s and led by Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield. The current leader of the party is Michael Pintard and the current deputy leader is Shanendon Cartwright. 

The Free National Movement first came to power in 1992 after contesting numerous general elections without success. The party swept the 2017 general election, winning 35 of the 39 seats in the Legislature, but won only 7 seats in 2021, 28 seats less than it had won in the 2017 elections.

==History==

The party was established at the home of Jimmy Shepherd on Spring Hills Farms in Fox Hill in 1971. The Free-PLP had been a breakaway group of eight MPs from the governing Progressive Liberal Party. This group, which was known as the &quot;Dissident Eight&quot;, included Arthur Foulkes, Cecil Wallace-Whitfield, Warren J. Levarity, Maurice E. Moore, Curtis McMillan, James (Jimmy) Shepherd, Elwood Donaldson, and George Thompson. Following meetings held at Spring Hill Farms, the FNM officially became a political party in October 1971, with Wallace-Whitfield as leader.

The United Bahamian Party (UBP) had been one of the main political parties in the Bahamas, governing the country since the advent of party politics in 1958, until it lost the 1967 general election to the opposition PLP. The UBP party&#x27;s leadership was predominantly white, while blacks made up most of the citizenry. Once out of power, its leaders decided that the party&#x27;s time was at an end and they looked to the Free-PLP to form a new party that would follow a conservative party line. 

The FNM grew in part by uniting independent black voters and the old UBP voter base. 

Led by Kendal Isaacs, the party first contested the 1972 general election. However, these were heady days for the governing PLP, who had led the country to independence in 1973, and the FNM failed to gain much more than 40% of the vote in a string of general elections defeats. 

=== 1992 General election ===
In 1990, Hubert Ingraham took over the leadership of the party after the death of Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield. The FNM attacked the governing PLP on corruption charges.

In the general election of 1992, the FNM defeated its rival, the PLP, by wide margins, winning 32 of the then 49 seats. The FNM Government privatised the government-owned hotels, which had fallen into decline since nationalisation. Private radio stations were allowed to operate, ending the government&#x27;s broadcast monopoly. The FNM introduced local government and encouraged inward investment to grow the economy. 

=== 1997 General election ===
The elections of 1997 saw the FNM re-elected in a landslide, with 35 of the 40 seats in a reduced House.

=== 2002 General election ===
After Ingraham vowed not to seek a third term in office, Tommy Turnquest was elected leader of the party. The party then lost the 2002 elections. Many voters, including FNM supporters, felt that Turnquest was much &quot;weaker&quot; than Perry Christie, leader of the Progressive Liberal Party. 

=== 2007 General election ===
At the FNM&#x27;s party convention, following the general elections of 2002, Ingraham was returned as leader of the Free National Movement. The FNM went on to regain control of the House of Assembly in the elections of 2007.

=== 2012 General election ===
The FNM lost government to the Progressive Liberal Party once again in the 2012 Bahamian general elections; it dropped its total share of votes (obtaining only 42.1 percent of the vote, compared to 48.7 percent by the Progressive Liberal Party). The Progressives won 29 of the seats in the legislature and thus the government, compared to the FNM&#x27;s 9. 

=== Ingraham&#x27;s retirement and the 2017 General election ===
Ingraham subsequently resigned, both as party leader as well as the Member of Parliament for North Abaco, and announced his retirement from politics following the defeat. He had served in Parliament for 35 years, winning re-election seven times, including 2012. Ingraham told supporters, &quot;I gave it the best I could and now I&#x27;ve been rejected by the public of the Bahamas... We had no indication from the general public they would go that way.&quot; 

Following this series of events the FNM went on to lose the by-election triggered by Ingraham&#x27;s retirement held on 15 October 2012, reducing the total FNM seat count to 8 of the 38 seats in the House of Assembly. The FNM however went on to win the 2017 general election under the leadership of Hubert Minnis, gaining 35 seats out of 39 total.

=== 2021 General election ===
In September 2021, Prime Minister Minnis called a snap election. The ruling Free National Movement lost to the opposition Progressive Liberal Party, as the twin challenges of COVID-19 and 2019&#x27;s Hurricane Dorian left the Bahamian economy struggling to recover from its deepest crash since at least 1971. 

The Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) won 32 of the 39 seats in the House of Assembly. Free National Movement (FNM), led by Minnis, took the remaining seats. On 17 September 2021, the leader of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) Phillip Davis was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Bahamas to succeed Hubert Minnis.

<text>The Coup of 18 Brumaire () brought Napoleon Bonaparte to power as First Consul of the French First Republic. In the view of most historians, it ended the French Revolution and would soon lead to the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor of the French. This bloodless coup d&#x27;état overthrew the Directory, replacing it with the French Consulate. This occurred on 9 November 1799, which was 18 Brumaire, Year VIII, under the short-lived French Republican calendar system.

== Context ==
After Habsburg-controlled Austria declared war on France on 12 March 1799, emergency measures were adopted and the pro-war Jacobin faction, the Montagnards, triumphed in the 1799 French legislative election held in April. With Napoleon and the republic&#x27;s best army engaged in the French invasion of Egypt and Syria, France suffered a series of reverses on the battlefield in the spring and summer of 1799.

The Coup of 30 Prairial VII (18 June) ousted the Jacobins and left Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, a member of the five-man ruling Directory, the dominant figure in the government. France&#x27;s military situation improved following the Second Battle of Zurich. As the prospect of invasion receded, the Jacobins feared a revival of the pro-peace Royalist faction. When Napoleon returned to France on 9 October, both factions hailed him as the country&#x27;s saviour.

Dazzled by Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in the Middle East, the public received him with an ardor that convinced Sieyès he had found the general indispensable to his planned coup; however, from the moment of his return, Napoleon plotted a coup within the coup, ultimately gaining power for himself rather than Sieyès. Probably the weightiest possible obstacles to a coup were in the army. Some generals, such as Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, believed in republicanism; others, such as Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, believed themselves capable of governing France. Napoleon worked on the feelings of all, keeping secret his own intentions.

Before the coup, troops were conveniently deployed around Paris. The plan was to first persuade the Directors to resign, and then to get the Council of Ancients and the Council of Five Hundred (the upper and lower houses of the legislature, respectively) to appoint a pliant commission that would draw up a new constitution to the plotters&#x27; specifications.

==Events of 18 Brumaire, Year VIII==

On the morning of 18 Brumaire, Lucien Bonaparte falsely persuaded the Councils that a Jacobin coup was at hand in Paris, and induced them to depart for the safety of the suburban Château de Saint-Cloud. Napoleon was charged with the safety of the two Councils and given command of all available local troops. Later that morning, Sieyès and Roger Ducos resigned as Directors. The now former Minister of Foreign Affairs Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, a close ally of Napoleon, pressured Director Paul Barras to do the same.

The resignation of three of the five Directors on day one of the coup prevented a quorum and thus practically abolished the five-man Directory, but the two Jacobin Directors, Louis-Jérôme Gohier and Jean-François-Auguste Moulin, continued to protest furiously. Both men were arrested on day two by Napoleon&#x27;s ally General Jean Victor Marie Moreau, and by the following day, they were compelled to surrender. In contrast to the Directory, the two Councils were not yet intimidated and continued meeting.

==Events of 19 Brumaire==

By the following day, the deputies had, for the most part, realised that they were facing an attempted coup rather than being protected from a Jacobin rebellion. Faced with their refusal to submit, Napoleon stormed into the chambers, escorted by a small force of grenadiers. While perhaps unplanned, this proved to be the coup within the coup: from this point, this was a military affair. Napoleon found the Ancients resistant &quot;despite a massive show of military strength&quot;.

Napoleon was met with heckling as he addressed them with such &quot;home truths&quot; as &quot;the Republic has no government&quot;, and most likely &quot;the Revolution is over&quot;. One deputy called out, &quot;And the Constitution?&quot; Napoleon replied, referring to earlier parliamentary coups, &quot;The Constitution! You yourselves have destroyed it. You violated it on 18 Fructidor; you violated it on 22 Floreal; you violated it on 30 Prairial. It no longer has the respect of anyone.&quot; Napoleon&#x27;s reception by the Council of Five Hundred was even more hostile. His grenadiers entered just as the legality of Barras&#x27;s resignation was being challenged by the Jacobins in the chamber. Upon entering, Napoleon was first jostled, then outright assaulted. By some accounts, he came close to fainting. It was not Napoleon himself but his brother Lucien, president of the council, who called upon the grenadiers to defend their leader. Napoleon escaped but only through the use of military force.

A motion was raised in the Council of Five Hundred to declare Napoleon an outlaw. At this point, Lucien apparently slipped out of the chamber and told the soldiers guarding the Councils that the majority of the Five Hundred were being terrorised by a group of deputies brandishing daggers. According to Michael Rapport, &quot;He pointed to Napoleon&#x27;s bloody, pallid face as proof; although at least one account mentions Napoleon scratching his own face in frustration and rage until he drew blood. In a theatrical gesture, Lucien then seized a sword and promised to plunge it through his own brother&#x27;s heart if he were a traitor. Lucien ordered the troops to expel the violent deputies from the chamber. Grenadiers under the command of General Joachim Murat marched into the Orangerie and dispersed the council. This was effectively the end of the Directory. The Ancients passed a decree that adjourned the Councils for three months, appointed Napoleon, Sieyès, and Ducos provisional consuls, and named the &quot;Corps législatif&quot;. Some tractable members of the Five Hundred, rounded up afterwards, served to give these measures the confirmation of their House. As a result, the Directory and the Councils came to an end.

==Aftermath==
===Completion of the coup===
With the Council routed, the plotters convened two commissions, each consisting of twenty-five deputies from the two Councils. The plotters essentially intimidated the commissions into declaring a provisional government, the first form of the consulate with Napoleon, Sieyès, and Ducos as Consuls. The lack of reaction from the streets proved that the Revolution was, indeed, over. &quot;A shabby compound of brute force and imposture, the 18th Brumaire was nevertheless condoned, nay applauded, by the French nation. Weary of revolution, men sought no more than to be wisely and firmly governed.&quot; Resistance by Jacobin officeholders in the provinces was quickly crushed. Twenty Jacobin deputies were exiled, and others were arrested. The commissions then drew up the &quot;short and obscure Constitution of the Year VIII&quot;, the first of the constitutions since the Revolution without a Declaration of Rights.

Napoleon completed his coup within a coup by the adoption of a constitution under which the First Consul, a position he was sure to hold, had greater power than the other two. In particular, he appointed the Senate and the Senate interpreted the constitution. The &quot;Sénat conservateur&quot; allowed him to rule by decree, so the more independent &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; and &quot;Tribunat&quot; were relegated to unimportant roles. It led ultimately to the rise of the First French Empire.

==Legacy==
In 1852, Karl Marx wrote &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot; about a much later event, the 1851 French coup d&#x27;état against the Second Republic by Napoleon III, who was Napoleon&#x27;s nephew. Marx considered Napoleon III a trifling politician compared to his world-shaking uncle, as expressed in Marx&#x27;s oft-quoted opening: &quot;Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.&quot;

<doc id="408392" wikidata="Q2566823" url="?curid=408392" title="Progressive Liberal Party (Bahamas)">
<text>The Progressive Liberal Party (abbreviated PLP) is a populist and social liberal party in the Bahamas. Philip Davis is the leader of the party.

==History==
The PLP was founded in 1953 by William Cartwright, Cyril Stevenson, and Henry Milton Taylor. The PLP was the first national political party in the Bahamas.

The party governed for 25 straight years from 1967 to 1992, as well as from 2002 to 2007 and 2012 to 2017. Leading the party to its first victory in 1967 was Lynden Pindling, the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

Perry Christie was Prime Minister of the Bahamas between 2 May 2002 and the 2007 general elections, when the party was defeated by the rival Free National Movement (FNM) which won 23 seats of the 41 seats. The FNM installed leader Hubert Ingraham as the Prime Minister. After defeat and one of its MPs leaving the party since, the PLP held 17 of the 41 seats in the Bahamas National Assembly.

In the 2012 general election, the Progressive Liberals won a solid majority in a landslide election victory, taking 29 of the 38 seats in parliament. Christie was sworn into office on 8 May 2012.

Hubert Ingraham announced his retirement from politics following the defeat of his party.

In September 2021, the PLP defeated the ruling FNM in a snap election, as the economy struggled to recover from its deepest crash since at least 1971. The PLP won 32 of the 39 seats in the House of Assembly. The FNM took the remaining seats. On 17 September 2021, the chairman of the PLP Philip Davis was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Bahamas to succeed Hubert Minnis.

<doc id="408393" wikidata="Q2386975" url="?curid=408393" title="Chawton">
<text>Chawton is a village and civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. The village lies within the South Downs National Park and is famous as the home of Jane Austen for the last eight years of her life.

==History==
Chawton&#x27;s recorded history begins in the Domesday survey of 1086. The village held nineteen free residents, eight smallholders, six slaves (part of the sixty-seven slaves in the area from Alresford to the ridge parishes) and woodland with fifty pigs. In the 13th century, there was a royal manor house. The owner, John St John, served as deputy to Edward I in Scotland. Henry III visited the manor on over forty occasions. The descendants of John Knight, who built the present Chawton House at the time of the Armada (1588), added to it and modified the landscape in ways that reflect changes in politics, religion and taste. One of those descendants was Elizabeth Knight, whose progresses were marked by the ringing of church bells and whose two husbands both had to adopt her surname. Later in the 18th century, Jane Austen&#x27;s brother Edward Austen Knight (who had been adopted by the Knights) succeeded, and in 1809 was able to move his mother and sisters to a cottage in the village.

Chawton never developed into a settlement of substance, ‘possibly because the lords of the manor wished to keep the area for themselves’. Chawton’s private parliamentary enclosure took place in 1740-1 when a bad harvest followed a severe winter and eighteen food riots were recorded over large parts of the country. However, the Chawton act was mostly about sheep and its private act was merely the confirmation of an agreement already made. There is no mention at Chawton of encroachments, peasants’ cottages, or peasants’ rights of common forage and the rest. This was entirely an arrangement between the owners of the land for their individual benefit. From lists in Leigh’s book of Chawton Manor, one might have expected over thirty families to have held an interest, but all but one were already gone, not just from the Commons, but, soon, from the village entirely. ‘A thick cultural and social wedge was inserted between the improving husbandmen, the better sort of the parish, and the poor.’

Enclosure was nothing new in Chawton. In 1605, a court held by John Knight recognised that for the last thirty or forty years a ‘great part’ of the commons had been enclosed by tenants with the consent of the lord. However, these tenants still kept the same number of sheep on the reduced common land to everyone’s detriment. The enclosed lands at Chawton in 1740 came from the 312 acres of Common and from 309 acres made up of seven common fields: Ridgefield, Southfield, Northfield, Upper and Lower Eastfield, Whitedown and Winstreetfield. The lord, Thomas Knight, newly in position, did very well. His existing local estate already comprised fifteen houses and 1,569 acres: 734 of arable land, 108 of pasture, 56 meadow, 615 woodland and 55 rough heath. Now, through enclosure, he added 156 acres from the common and 143 acres from the common fields, 48 per cent of the available total, and almost 2,000 acres altogether in Hampshire. Knight’s allotment was increased by the herbage of all the highways on the Common, and, because he was the lord, ‘free liberty’ by June 1742 to ‘sell, cut down, grub up, take, cart, and carry away’ all the timber trees, pollard trees, bushes and wood, anywhere on the Common for which his workmen could enter any allotment at any time.

==Visitor attractions==
===Chawton Cottage===

Chawton Cottage, Jane Austen&#x27;s house and garden are open to the public.

===Chawton House===

Chawton House, the 400-year-old Grade II* listed Elizabethan manor house that once belonged to Jane Austen&#x27;s brother and of land, has been restored as part of a major international project to establish the new Centre for the Study of Early Women&#x27;s Writing, 1600–1830. It houses a collection of over 9,000 volumes, together with some related manuscripts. Visitors can see the relationship between the library, the house, the estate and a working farm of the 18th and early 19th centuries.

In 1992 a 125-year lease on the house was purchased for £1.25 million by a foundation established by Sandra Lerner, co-founder of Cisco Systems.

===St Nicholas&#x27; Church===

Chawton has a single church, St Nicholas. A church has stood on the site in Chawton since at least 1270 when it was mentioned in a diocesan document. The church suffered a disastrous fire in 1871 which destroyed all but the chancel. The rebuilt church was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and is now listed Grade 2*.

The churchyard was reserved for burial for the Knight family, and the graves include that of Jane Austen&#x27;s mother and sister, both called Cassandra.

Inside the tower are a total of eight bells, six of which were cast in 2009 by the firm Taylors, Eayre &amp; Smith at Loughborough Bellfoundry in Leicestershire, and these form a ring of bells for traditional English change ringing. These replaced an earlier ring of bells, two of which remain in the tower for chiming.

==Services==
Chawton C of E Primary School is the only school in Chawton. It is within the Diocese of Winchester and accepts children from ages four to eleven, and has close ties with St Nicholas&#x27;s church. There has been a school on the site since about 1840, and the site sits opposite the village green and cricket field.

On Winchester Road, which runs through the village, there is a tea shop and small shop opposite Jane Austen&#x27;s house called Cassandra&#x27;s Cup, which is named after Jane Austen&#x27;s sister. Just down the road from this is a Fuller&#x27;s pub called The Greyfriar which has an oak beamed traditional bar, a secluded beer garden and a large car park. Also on Winchester Road is the Village Hall.

Adjacent to Gosport Road lies a green containing a cricket pitch and the home of Chawton Cricket Club, a newly refurbished playground and a set of allotments.

<text>The Barbados Labour Party (BLP), colloquially known as the &quot;Bees&quot;, is a social democratic political party in Barbados established in 1938. It has been in power in 1954–1961, 1976–1986, 1994–2008, and 2018–present. The BLP has been the governing party of Barbados since 2018. 

The current Party Leader is Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley, SC,MP while the Chairman is Reginald Farley, FB and General-Secretary is Dr. Jerome Walcott, FB, FRCS. Santia Bradshaw, MP is Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business in The House of Assembly, The Parliament of Barbados. 

Former party leaders include Sir Grantley Adams, Dr. Hugh Gordon Cummins, Sir Harold Bernard St. John, Tom Adams, Sir Henry Forde and Professor Owen Arthur, PC. 

Like Barbados&#x27; other major party, the Democratic Labour Party or the &quot;Dems&quot;, the BLP has been broadly described as a centre-left social-democratic party, with local politics being largely personality-driven and responsive to contemporary issues and the state of the economy. However, the party distinguishes itself by being rooted in Asquithian Liberal policies, including a focus on trade as a way of bolstering economic growth over the creation of social services. 

The BLP is a former observer member of the Socialist International.

== History ==
Originally called the Barbados Progressive League until 1944, the party was founded on 31 March 1938 at the home of James Martineau. During the first meeting, Chrissie Brathwaite and Grantley Adams were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Adams had entered the House of Assembly in 1934 partly through his deconstruction of the labour-focused efforts of the Charles Duncan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s Democratic League, but this new party turned to organizing the political movement brought on by the unrest of 1937 that he had earlier opposed. As such, their objectives included many of the league&#x27;s original goals, such as adult suffrage, free education, and better housing and health care.

The BLP first participated in general elections in 1940. In 1994, Owen Arthur became the prime minister as leader of the Barbados Labour Party. In the 2003 elections the BLP won 23 out of the 30 seats. The number increased to 24 in 2006, when in an almost unprecedented development the leader of the opposition, after a bitter and tumultuous internal battle within his own party, resigned the post and joined the governing party.
The Barbados Labour Party governed from 1994 to 2008, which was commonly called the &quot;Owen Arthur Administration&quot;. Prime Minister Arthur was chosen from among leaders around the globe to deliver the William Wilberforce lecture on the 200th anniversary of the Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade Act.

The party lost power in the 2008 general election, winning 10 seats against 20 for the Democratic Labour Party (DLP). After the election, Arthur stepped down as BLP leader and was replaced by former deputy prime minister Mia Mottley in a leadership election against Attorney-General of Barbados Dale Marshall. Mottley also became opposition leader.

In the summer of 2008 Hamilton Lashley, MP for St. Michael South East, resigned from the party to become an independent candidate in the House of Assembly. He was thereafter given a job by the DLP, the party he had belonged before crossing the floor to the BLP, as a consultant on poverty. This move by the member reduced to nine the number of seats the Barbados Labour Party had in the House.

After a decade in opposition, the BLP returned to power on 25 May 2018 under Mia Mottley, who became Barbados&#x27;s first female prime minister. The party originally won all of the seats in the House of Assembly, but Bishop Joseph Atherley, the MP for St. Michael West, became an independent MP (later founder and leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Democracy and Development) and the leader of the opposition on 2 June 2018. 

In January 2022, Prime Minister Mia Mottley&#x27;s Labor Party (BLP) obtained a landslide victory, winning all 30 legislative seats, in the first general election since Barbados became a republic in 2021.

<text>The Democratic Labour Party (DLP), colloquially known as the &quot;Dems&quot;, is a political party in Barbados, established in 1955. It was the ruling party from 15 January 2008 to 24 May 2018 but faced an electoral wipeout in the 2018 general election which left it with no MPs.

In common with Barbados&#x27; other major party, the Barbados Labour Party, the DLP has been broadly described as centre-left social-democratic party, with local politics being largely personality-driven and responsive to contemporary issues and the state of the economy. Historically, the BLP claims a heritage from British liberalism, while the DLP was founded 11 years afterwards as a more left-leaning breakaway group.

==History==
The DLP was founded in 1955 by Errol Barrow, James Cameron Tudor, Frederick &quot;Sleepy&quot; Smith and 26 others. Once members of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP), these 29 broke away to form this more left-leaning alternative. However, as a result of their common origin, the two parties have been and remain ideologically similar. In the 1956 general election the DLP received 19.9% of the vote and won four seats. In the following election in 1961 it received fewer votes than the BLP, but won a majority of the seats in Parliament, with Barrow becoming Premier.

After the party retained power in the 1966 election (this time with a plurality of the vote), Barrow became the country&#x27;s first prime minister. The party won a third successive election in 1971, but lost power to the BLP in 1976. It remained in opposition until victory in the 1986 election, in which it won 24 of the 27 seats. The DLP remained in power following the 1991 election, but was defeated by the BLP in 1994. It returned to power again in the 2008 election, when DLP leader David Thompson became prime minister. Following his death in 2010, Freundel Stuart succeeded to the office, and led the party to a narrow election victory in 2013.

The 2018 election saw the DLP lose all of its MPs. Stuart stepped down as leader, and Verla De Peiza, unopposed in a leadership election held by the party on 1 August 2018, became his successor in the role of DLP leader and president.

After losing the 2022 election which resulted in the DLP not regaining any seats in the House of Assembly, De Peiza resigned on 21 January 2022. Ronnie Yearwood was then later elected DLP president after DLP elections took place on 1 May 2022.

Barbados Labour Party MP Ralph Thorne left the BLP in February 2024, becoming Leader of the Opposition. He joined the DLP shortly thereafter, becoming the party&#x27;s leader and Thorne became the first DLP MP since 2018. Ronnie Yearwood remained as president of the party until his expulsion from the party along with Secretary General Steve Blackett on the 24th August 2024 after a months-long inter-party dispute occurred.

<text>This article lists political parties in the country of Belize.

Belize has a two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties. It is difficult to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.

== Political culture ==
In 1950, after the general worker union had been formed, the people&#x27;s committee constituted itself as the PUP (People&#x27;s United Party) and taken the majority seating in the elected Belize city council. When Belize became fully independent and joined in the Commonwealth on September 21, 1981, the two parties UDP (United Democratic Party) and PUP rose in the political scene. This made an effect two-party system. The UDP believes in pro-business and the PUP believes in pro-labour but both are closely centred in the spectrum. The PUP foster the idea of political independence but their opposition UDP believe in the national interest of equitable distribution of public services from the government.

The party system is dominated by the centre-left People&#x27;s United Party and the centre-right United Democratic Party. There have been other small parties that have participated at all levels of governmental elections in the past. Although none of these small political parties have ever won any significant number of seats and/or offices, their challenge has been growing over the years.

<doc id="408407" wikidata="Q1371495" url="?curid=408407" title="System Shock 2">
<text>System Shock 2 is a 1999 action role-playing survival horror video game designed by Ken Levine and co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. Originally intended to be a standalone title, its story was changed during production into a sequel to the 1994 game &quot;System Shock&quot;. The alterations were made when Electronic Arts—who owned the &quot;System Shock&quot; franchise rights—signed on as publisher.

The game takes place on board a starship in a cyberpunk depiction of 2114. The player assumes the role of a soldier trying to stem the outbreak of a genetic infection that has devastated the ship. Like &quot;System Shock&quot;, gameplay consists of first-person combat and exploration. It incorporates role-playing elements, in which the player can develop skills and traits, such as hacking and psionic abilities.

&quot;System Shock 2&quot; was originally released in August 1999 for Microsoft Windows. The game received critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial sales expectations. Many critics later determined that the game was highly influential in subsequent game design, particularly on first-person shooters, and considered it far ahead of its time. It has been included in several &quot;greatest games of all time&quot; lists. In 2007, Irrational Games released a spiritual successor to the &quot;System Shock&quot; series, titled &quot;BioShock&quot;, to critical acclaim and strong sales.

&quot;System Shock 2&quot; had been in intellectual property limbo following the closure of Looking Glass Studios. Nightdive Studios were able to secure the rights to the game and the &quot;System Shock&quot; franchise in 2013 to release an updated version of &quot;System Shock 2&quot; for modern operating systems, including for OS X and Linux, and announced plans to release an Enhanced Edition of the game. OtherSide Entertainment announced in 2015 that they had acquired the rights from Nightdive Studios to produce a sequel, &quot;System Shock 3&quot;, but as of 2020 the rights have since been transferred to Tencent.

==Gameplay==
As in its predecessor, &quot;System Shock&quot;, gameplay in &quot;System Shock 2&quot; is an amalgamation of the action role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered signature role-playing elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while the role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.

The backstory is explained progressively through the player&#x27;s acquisition of audio logs and encounters with ghostly apparitions. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a career in a branch of the Unified National Nominate, a fictional military organization. Each branch of service gives the player a set of starting bonuses composed of certain skills, though may thereafter freely develop as the player chooses. The Marine begins with bonuses to weaponry, the Navy officer is skilled in repairing and hacking, and the OSA agent gets a starting set of psionic powers.

The player can upgrade their skills by using &quot;cyber-modules&quot; given as rewards for completing objectives such as searching the ship and spend them at devices called &quot;cyber-upgrade units&quot; to obtain enhanced skills. Operating system (O/S) units allow one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement). An in-game currency called &quot;nanites&quot; may be spent on items at vending machines, including ammunition supplies and health packs. &quot;Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines&quot; can be activated and reconstitute the player for 10 nanites if they die inside the area in which the machine resides. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a save point. The player can hack devices, such as keypads to open alternate areas and vending machines to reduce prices. When a hack is attempted, a minigame begins that features a grid of green nodes; the player must connect three in a straight row to succeed. Optionally, electronic lock picks, called &quot;ICE-picks&quot;, can be found that will automatically hack a machine, regardless of its difficulty.

Throughout the game, the player can procure various weapons, including melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break if they are not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armour-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.

The game includes a research function. When new objects are encountered in the game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected; when combined with chemicals found in storage rooms, the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation, can be learned.

==Plot==

===Backstory===

In 2072, after the Citadel Station&#x27;s demise in &quot;System Shock&quot;, TriOptimum&#x27;s attempts to cover up the incident were exposed to the media, and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station&#x27;s population; the ruthless malevolent AI supercomputer named SHODAN controlled the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a large number of trials, the company went bankrupt, and its operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a successor to the UN, was established to combat the hostility and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to the most rudimentary of tasks to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and the development of new technologies was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker (&quot;System Shock&quot;″s main protagonist), who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from the public eye.

In 2100, 28 years later, the company&#x27;s failed stocks and assets were bought by a Russian oligarch named Anatoly Korenchkin, a former black market operator who sought to make money legitimately. He re-licensed and restored the company to its former status in the following decade. Along with producing healthcare and consumer products, Korenchkin signed weapons contracts with various military organizations, private and political-owned. The new UNN was virtually powerless, with Korenchkin exercising control over them.

In January 2114, 42 years after the Citadel events and 14 years into rebuilding TriOptimum, the company created an experimental FTL starship, the &quot;Von Braun&quot;, which is on its maiden voyage. The ship is followed by a UNN space vessel, the &quot;Rickenbacker&quot;, controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego, son of the Citadel Station&#x27;s infamous commander, Edward Diego, and public hero of the Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States Police Action. Because the &quot;Rickenbacker&quot; does not have an FTL system, the two ships are attached for the trip. However, Korenchkin was egotistical enough to make himself the captain of the &quot;Von Braun&quot; despite being inexperienced.

Five months into the journey, the ships respond to a distress signal from the planet Tau Ceti V, outside the Solar System. A rescue team is sent to the planet&#x27;s surface, where they discover strange eggs; these eggs, found in an old ejection pod, infect the rescue team and integrate them into an alien communion known as &quot;the Many&quot; - a psychic hive mind generated by parasitic worms which can infect and mutate a human host. The parasites eventually spread to both ships and take over or kill most of their crews.

===Story===
Owing to a computer malfunction, the remaining soldier awakens with amnesia in a cryo-tube on the medical deck of the &quot;Von Braun&quot;, being implanted with an illegal cyber-neural interface. Another survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, contacts and guides him to safety before the cabin depressurizes. She demands that he meets her on deck 4 of the &quot;Von Braun&quot;. Along the way, the soldier battles the infected crew members. The Many telepathically communicate with him, attempting to convince him to join them. After restarting the ship&#x27;s engine core, the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers that Polito is dead and is soon confronted by SHODAN. It is revealed she has been posing as Polito to gain the soldier&#x27;s trust.

SHODAN mentions that she is responsible for creating the Many through her bioengineering experiments on Citadel Station. The Hacker, who freed her from her ethical restraints, ejected the grove that contained her experiments to prevent them from contaminating Earth, an act that allowed part of SHODAN to survive in the grove. The grove crash-landed on Tau Ceti V. While SHODAN went into forced hibernation, the Many evolved beyond her control. SHODAN tells the soldier that his only chance for survival lies in helping destroy her creations. Efforts to regain control of XERXES, the main computer on the &quot;Von Braun&quot;, fail. SHODAN informs the soldier that destroying the ship is their only option, but he must transmit her program to the &quot;Rickenbacker&quot; first. While en route, the soldier briefly encounters two survivors, Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Suarez and Rebecca Siddons, who flee the ship aboard an escape pod.

With the transfer complete, the soldier travels to the &quot;Rickenbacker&quot; and learns both ships have been enveloped by the infection&#x27;s source, a gigantic mass of bio-organic tissue that has wrapped itself over the two ships. The soldier enters the biomass and destroys its core, stopping the infection. SHODAN congratulates him and tells of her intentions to merge real space and cyberspace through the &quot;Von Braun&quot;″s faster-than-light drive. The soldier confronts SHODAN in cyberspace and defeats her. The final scene shows Tommy and Rebecca receiving a message from the &quot;Von Braun&quot;. Tommy responds, saying they will return and noting that Rebecca is acting strange. Rebecca speaks in a SHODAN-like voice, asking Tommy if he &quot;likes her new look&quot; as the screen fades to black.

== History ==

=== Development ===
Development of &quot;System Shock 2&quot; began in 1997 when Looking Glass Studios approached Irrational Games with an idea to co-develop a game. The development team were fans of &quot;System Shock&quot; and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title, according to its pitch document, was &quot;Junction Point&quot;. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop the concept of a dungeon crawler, like &quot;Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss&quot;, in a science fiction setting, the basis for &quot;System Shock&quot;. However, the press mistook &quot;System Shock&quot; to be closer to a &quot;Doom&quot; clone which was cited for its poor financial success. With &quot;Junction Point&quot;, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from &quot;Doom&quot;.

The title took 18 months to create with a budget of $1.7 million. It was pitched to several publishers until Electronic Arts—who owned the rights to the &quot;System Shock&quot; franchise—responded by suggesting the game become a sequel to &quot;System Shock&quot;. The development team agreed; Electronic Arts became the publisher and story changes were made to incorporate the franchise. The project was allotted one year to be completed and to compensate for the short time frame, the staff began working with Looking Glass Studio&#x27;s unfinished Dark Engine, the same engine used to create &quot;&quot;.

The designers included role-playing elements. Similar to &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, another Looking Glass Studios project, the environment in &quot;System Shock 2&quot; is persistent and constantly changes without the player&#x27;s presence. Paper-and-pencil role-playing games were influential; the character customization system was based on &quot;Traveller&quot;″s methodology and was implemented in the fictional military branches which, by allowing multiple character paths, the player could receive a more open-ended gameplay experience. Horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was deemed primary, which resulted in the player having little physical contact with other sentient beings. Secondly, a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character. Last were the inclusion of moody sound effects and &quot;the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows&quot;. The game&#x27;s lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of &quot;System Shock&quot; villain SHODAN. Part of Levine&#x27;s design was to ally the player with her. Levine sought to challenge the player by having SHODAN betray the player: &quot;Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the &quot;player&quot; never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that &quot;they&quot;, and not [only] the character, were led on and deceived&quot;. This design choice was controversial with the development team.

Several problems were encountered during the project. Because the team comprised two software companies, tension emerged regarding job assignments and some developers left the project. Additionally, many employees were largely inexperienced, but in retrospect project manager Jonathan Chey felt this was advantageous, stating &quot;inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment that might not have been present with a more jaded set of developers.&quot; The Dark Engine posed problems of its own. It was unfinished, forcing the programmers to fix software bugs when encountered. In contrast, working closely with the engine code allowed them to write additional features. Not all setbacks were localized; a demonstration build at E3 was hindered when it was requested all guns be removed from the presentation due to then-recent Columbine High School massacre.

=== Release ===
A demo for the game, featuring a tutorial and a third of the first mission, was released on August 2, 1999. Nine days later, &quot;System Shock 2&quot; was shipped to retailers in North America. The game was made available in the United Kingdom one month later on September 18. An enhancement patch was released a month later and added significant features, such as co-operative multiplayer and control over weapon degradation and enemy respawn rates. A port was planned for the Dreamcast but was canceled.

=== End-of-support ===
Around 2000, with the end-of-support for the game by the developer and publisher, remaining bugs and compatibility with newer operating systems and hardware became a growing problem. To compensate the missing support, some fans of the game became active in the modding community to update the game. For instance, the &quot;Rebirth&quot; graphical enhancement mod replaced many low-polygonal models with higher quality ones, a &quot;Shock Texture Upgrade Project&quot; increased the resolution of textures, and an updated level editor was released by the user community.

=== Intellectual property debacle and re-release ===
The intellectual property (IP) rights of &quot;System Shock 2&quot; were caught for years in complications between Electronic Arts and Meadowbrook Insurance Group (the parent company of Star Insurance Company), the entity that acquired the assets of Looking Glass Studios on their closure, though according to a lawyer for Star Insurance, they themselves have since acquired the lingering intellectual property rights from EA.

In the player community, attempts had been made to update and patch &quot;System Shock 2&quot; for known issues on newer operating systems and limitations that had been hard-coded into the game. In 2009, a complete copy of &quot;System Shock 2&quot;″s Dark Engine source code was discovered in the possession of an ex-Looking Glass Studios employee who was at the time continuing his work for Eidos Interactive. In late April 2010, a user on the Dreamcast Talk forum disassembled the contents of a Dreamcast development kit he had purchased, and among the content he received into some of the source code for Looking Glass games, including &quot;System Shock&quot;. An unknown user, going only as &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; (The Raven), issued a patch for &quot;System Shock 2&quot; and &quot;Thief 2&quot; in 2012 that resolved several of the known issue with the Dark engine and other features. It is believed that the patches were enabled by the Dreamcast kit, using a combination of the available source code and by disassembling libraries off the development kit. The patch became known informally as the &quot;NewDark&quot; patch to distinguish it from other efforts to improve the game.

At about the same time, Stephen Kick of Night Dive Studios had been seeking to license the &quot;System Shock&quot; property as to create &quot;System Shock 3&quot;. Star Insurance had not been willing to grant that license but did agree to allow Night Dive Studios to bring &quot;System Shock 2&quot; to modern systems. Shortly after getting this approval, the NewDark patch had been released, and Kick attempted to contact &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; to discuss the use of their patch, but the user was impossible to contact. Kick decided to approach GOG.com for a timed-exclusive release on their digital distribution website in February 2013, where the game was the most requested to be added to the catalog. This version, considered by GOG.com to be a &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot;, included the &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; NewDark patch. In addition, the updates allow user-made modifications to be applied more seamlessly. The release also contains additional material such as the game&#x27;s soundtrack, maps of the Von Braun, and the original pitch document for the game. The update rights also allowed a Mac OS X version of &quot;System Shock 2&quot; to be subsequently released on June 18, 2013, through GOG.com. The title became available on Steam on May 10, 2013. In April 2014 a Linux version was also released. &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; has continued to update the game since 2012, with their patches being incorporated into the versions that Night Dive distributes through GOG.com and Steam.

Since then, Night Dive Studios acquired the rights to &quot;System Shock&quot;, releasing an enhanced version in September 2015. Kick has reported they have acquired full rights to the series since then.

==Reception==
&quot;System Shock 2&quot; received critical acclaim. It received over a dozen awards, including seven &quot;Game of the Year&quot; prizes. Reviews were very positive and lauded the title for its hybrid gameplay, moody sound design, and engaging story. &quot;System Shock 2&quot; is regarded by critics as highly influential, particularly on first-person shooters and the horror genre. In a retrospective article, GameSpot declared the title &quot;well ahead of its time&quot; and stated that it &quot;upped the ante in dramatic and mechanical terms&quot; by creating a horrific gameplay experience. Despite critical acclaim and being the tenth best selling PC game in the US the month of its release, the title did not perform well commercially; only 58,671 copies were sold by April 2000.

Several publications praised the title for its open-ended gameplay. With regard to character customization, Trent Ward of IGN stated the best element of the role-playing system was allowing gamers to &quot;play the game as completely different characters&quot;, and felt this made each play-through unique. Erik Reckase writing for Just Adventure agreed, saying &quot;There are very few games that allow you [to] play the way you want&quot;. Alec Norands of Allgame believed that the different character classes made the game &quot;diverse enough to demand instant replayability&quot;. Robert Mayer from &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; called &quot;System Shock 2&quot; &quot;a game that truly defies classification in a single genre&quot;, and ensured that &quot;the action is occasionally fast-paced, it&#x27;s more often tactical, placing a premium on thought rather than on reflexes.&quot;

Buck DeFore reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Bluntly put, &quot;System Shock 2&quot; is a welcome visit to the lost arts of the good old days, and an immersive experience as long as you don&#x27;t mind some of the cobwebs that come along with it.&quot;

A number of critics described the game as frightening. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described the atmosphere as &quot;gripping&quot; and guaranteed readers they would &quot;jump out of [their] skin&quot; numerous times. Allgame found the sound design particularly effective, calling it &quot;absolutely, teeth-clenchingly disturbing&quot;, while &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s William Harms christened &quot;System Shock 2&quot; as the most frightening game he had ever played. Some critics found the weapon degradation system to be irritating, and members of the development team have also expressed misgivings about the system. The role-playing system was another point of contention; GameSpot described the job system as &quot;badly unbalanced&quot; because the player can develop skills outside their career choice. Allgame felt similarly about the system, saying it &quot;leaned towards a hacker character&quot;.

Along with &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, Sid Shuman of &quot;GamePro&quot; christened &quot;System Shock 2&quot; &quot;[one of the] twin barrels of modern [first-person shooter] innovation&quot;, owing to its complex role-playing gameplay. IGN writer Cam Shea referred to the game as &quot;another reinvention of the FPS genre&quot;, citing the story, characters, and RPG system. &quot;PC Zone&quot; lauded the game as a &quot;fabulous example of a modern-day computer game&quot; and named it &quot;a sci-fi horror masterpiece&quot;. The title has been inducted into a number of features listing the greatest games ever made, including ones by GameSpy, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, IGN, GameSpot and &quot;PC Gamer&quot;. IGN also ranked &quot;System Shock 2&quot; as the 35th greatest first-person shooter of all time. X-Play called it the second scariest game of all time, behind &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;. SHODAN has proven to be a popular character among most critics, including IGN, GameSpot and &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

&quot;System Shock 2&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 1999 &quot;Best Roleplaying Game&quot; and &quot;Special Achievement in Sound&quot; awards, and was a runner-up in the magazine&#x27;s overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; category. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated it for their &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; prize, which ultimately went to &quot;&quot;.

==Legacy==
=== 25th anniversary remaster ===
On a stream during the 20th anniversary of &quot;System Shock 2&quot; on August 11, 2019, Night Dive announced an Enhanced Edition of the game was in development. Night Dive had been able to acquire and use the original game&#x27;s source code, allowing them to improve upon the original. They plan to port the game to their KEX engine, the same engine they are using for the &quot;System Shock&quot; enhanced edition, and will work to make sure that the co-operative play features are better implemented. The enhanced version will aim to support all existing mods and custom maps developed by the gaming community, though will require work with the community to help with compatibility. Kick has stated that while they would like to work with &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; to incorporate their patches into the Enhanced Edition, they will likely need to deviate so that Night Dive can improve upon the original title. Kick later confirmed on Twitter that the enhanced edition will release for all platforms.

Alongside development of the Enhanced Edition will be a virtual reality (VR) version, though this will release at a later time as the Enhanced Edition. The VR version will use gameplay features that were introduced with &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, and will be cross-play compatible in its multiplayer mode with PC users that are not using VR modes.

Night Dive announced in February 2025 that they had renamed the Enhanced Edition &quot;System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&quot;, as well as stating that its release date would be announced during the Game Developers Conference in March 2025.

=== Sequel projects ===
&quot;System Shock 2&quot; has amassed a cult following, with fans asking for a sequel. On January 9, 2006, GameSpot reported that Electronic Arts had renewed its trademark protection on the &quot;System Shock&quot; name, leading to speculation that &quot;System Shock 3&quot; might be under development. Three days later, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reported a reliable source had come forward and confirmed the title&#x27;s production. Electronic Arts UK made no comment when confronted with the information. &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; stated the team behind &quot;The Godfather: The Game&quot; (EA Redwood Shores, later Visceral, defunct 2017) was charged with its creation. Ken Levine, when asked whether he would helm the third installment, replied: &quot;that question is completely out of my hands&quot;. He expressed optimism at the prospect of &quot;System Shock 3&quot;, but revealed that EA had not shown interest in his own proposal for a sequel, and was not optimistic with regards to their abilities. Electronic Arts did not confirm a new title in the series and allowed the &quot;System Shock&quot; trademark registration to lapse. Redwood Shores&#x27; next release was 2008&#x27;s &quot;Dead Space&quot;, a game with noted similarities in theme and presentation to the &quot;System Shock&quot; series. According to &quot;Dead Space&quot; designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell, their project was originally intended to be &quot;System Shock 3&quot;, before the release of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; inspired them to go back to the drawing board and develop it into something more along those lines, eventually becoming &quot;Dead Space&quot;.

In March 2015, a fan sequel mod for the game, &quot;System Shock Infinite&quot;, was released, incorporating elements from spiritual successor &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;.

In November 2015, Night Dive Studios, after acquiring the rights to the &quot;System Shock&quot; franchise, stated they were considering developing a third title in the series. In December 2015, OtherSide Entertainment, a studio founded by former Looking Glass Studios designer Paul Neurath, announced they were developing &quot;System Shock 3&quot; with rights granted to them by Night Dive Studios. OtherSide had acquired rights to make sequels to &quot;System Shock&quot; some years before this point but did not have the rights to the series name, which Night Dive was able to provide. The sequel will feature Terri Brosius reprising her voice for SHODAN, and will include work from original &quot;System Shock&quot; concept artist Robb Waters. Warren Spector, the producer of the first &quot;System Shock&quot;, announced in February 2016 that he has joined OtherSide Entertainment and will be working on &quot;System Shock 3&quot;. According to Spector, the narrative will pick up immediately from the end of &quot;System Shock 2&quot;, with SHODAN having taken over Rebecca&#x27;s body. &quot;System Shock 3&quot; will use the Unity game engine, with a teaser shown during Unity&#x27;s press event at the 2019 Game Developers Conference.

Starbreeze Studios was originally planning to provide a $12 million &quot;publishing-only&quot; investment in &quot;System Shock 3&quot;, allowing OtherSide to retain all rights while seeking a 120% return on investment followed by equal shares of revenue splitting. Starbreeze&#x27;s investment would allow the game to be developed for consoles in addition to the planned personal computer versions. However, in the wake of several financial problems in late 2018, Starbreeze has given back the publishing rights to &quot;System Shock 3&quot; to OtherSide, and separated itself from the project. OtherSide stated they had the capability to self-publish &quot;System Shock 3&quot; should they be unable to find a publishing partner but would prefer to have a publishing partner. At least twelve OtherSide employees working on &quot;System Shock 3&quot;, including several in lead roles, left the studio between late 2019 and early 2020. One former employee stated that the game&#x27;s development team was &quot;no longer employed&quot;; however, in April 2020, OtherSide&#x27;s vice president of marketing and development, Walter Somol, stated that the team was &quot;still here&quot; and progress on the project was &quot;coming along nicely&quot;, but they were working remotely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After several journalists noted that the &quot;System Shock 3&quot; websites had been transferred to ownership under Tencent in May 2020, Otherside confirmed that they had been unable to continue the series as a smaller studio and transferred the licensed rights to Tencent to continue its development, though Spector affirmed that OtherSide was still involved in its development alongside Tencent.

Warren Spector has since stated that OtherSide stopped working on &quot;System Shock 3&quot; in 2019, and that they are now working on an immersive simulation based on a new intellectual property developed by OtherSide.

In 2022, during Gamescon, Stephen Kick, Night Dive&#x27;s CEO, stated in an interview after he finished the &quot;System Shock&quot; remake, that he intended to begin development on a &quot;System Shock 2&quot; remake.

=== Spiritual successors ===
In 2007, Irrational Games—briefly known as 2K Boston/2K Australia—released a spiritual successor to the &quot;System Shock&quot; series, entitled &quot;BioShock&quot;. The game takes place in an abandoned underwater utopian community destroyed by the genetic modification of its populace and shares many gameplay elements with &quot;System Shock 2&quot;: reconstitution stations can be activated, allowing the player to be resurrected when they die; hacking, ammo conservation, and exploration are integral parts of gameplay; and unique powers may be acquired via plasmids, special abilities that function similarly to psionics in &quot;System Shock 2&quot;. The two titles share plot similarities and employ audio logs and encounters with ghostly apparitions to reveal backstory. In &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, Irrational Games included a gameplay feature called &quot;1999 Mode&quot;, specifically in reference to &quot;System Shock 2&quot;″s release year, designed to provide a similar game experience with a higher difficulty and long-lasting effects of choices made that would remind players of &quot;System Shock&quot;″s unforgiving nature.

In 2017, Arkane Studios published &quot;Prey&quot;, which takes place on a space station named &quot;Talos I&quot;, similar to &quot;System Shock&quot;. It, too, features psionic abilities, in the form of &quot;Neuromods&quot;, as a fundamental gameplay feature, and uses a mixture of audio logs and pieces of text to advance the game&#x27;s backstory. &quot;Prey&quot; features elements like hacking, crafting, and features a heavy emphasis on side-quest exploration and careful conservation of ammunition and &quot;Psi Points&quot;, player stat that controls how many psi abilities can be used. The game features crew members who have become infected, though, not as the result of an AI, but instead as the result of a failure of containment around a mysterious alien species known as the Typhon. Within the game, references are made to &quot;System Shock&quot;″s developers, such as the &quot;Looking Glass&quot; technology that plays a significant role in the story&#x27;s plot.

<doc id="408409" wikidata="Q2072512" url="?curid=408409" title="Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham">
<text>Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham (24 October 1675 – 14 September 1749) was a British soldier and Whig politician. After serving as a junior officer under William III during the Williamite War in Ireland and during the Nine Years&#x27; War, he fought under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the War of the Quadruple Alliance Temple led a force of 4,000 troops on a raid on the Spanish coastline which captured Vigo and occupied it for ten days before withdrawing. In Parliament he generally supported the Whigs but fell out with Sir Robert Walpole in 1733. He was known for his ownership of and modifications to the estate at Stowe and for serving as a political mentor to the young William Pitt.

==Military career==
Born the son of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet, and his wife Mary Temple (née Knapp, daughter of Thomas Knapp), Temple was educated at Eton College and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and was commissioned as an ensign in Prince George of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment on 30 June 1685. After becoming a captain in Babington&#x27;s Regiment in 1689, he fought under William III during the Williamite War in Ireland against the Jacobite Irish Army of James II. He was present at the Siege of Namur in July 1695 during the Nine Years&#x27; War.
Temple succeeded his father as 4th Baronet in May 1697 and as Whig member of parliament for Buckingham later that year: he continued to represent either Buckingham or Buckinghamshire for the next 16 years. Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 10 February 1702, he was given his own regiment to command. He fought under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough at the Battle of Venlo in September 1702 and at the Battle of Roermond in October 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. He also took part in the Battle of Oudenarde in July 1708 and the Siege of Lille in Autumn 1708.

For his good conduct at Lille he was sent home to present the despatches to Queen Anne. In Parliament he supported the Whigs and voted for the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708 which allowed Protestants fleeing from the continent to enter Great Britain. Promoted to major-general on 1 January 1709, he fought again at the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 January 1710. In Parliament, in accordance with Whig party policy, he voted for the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a clergyman who had criticised the party, in March 1710.

In recognition of his service in the field, Temple was appointed colonel of the Princess Anne of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons in April 1710. From 1711, he made dramatic changes to his family estate at Stowe; the work was carried out under the guidance of John Vanbrugh, a skilled architect, and the future royal gardener, Charles Bridgeman.

In 1713, the Harley Ministry stripped Temple of his colonelcy for voting against the Treaty of Utrecht. However, after George I ascended the throne following the Hanoverian Succession, Temple became ambassador to Vienna and was created Baron Cobham in October 1714. He became colonel of The Royal Regiment of Dragoons in 1715 and Constable of Windsor Castle in 1716. He was made a Privy Councillor in July 1716 and created Viscount Cobham in April 1718. 

Temple was a mentor and Patron to a number of young Whigs, the most notable being William Pitt. Collectively they became known as Cobham&#x27;s Cubs. Two of them, Pitt and Temple&#x27;s nephew George Grenville went on to be prime minister. In September 1719, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, Temple led a force of 4,000 troops on a raid on the Spanish coastline which captured Vigo and occupied it for ten days before withdrawing.

Temple generally supported the government of Sir Robert Walpole once it came to power in April 1721 and was rewarded with the colonelcy of the King&#x27;s Own Regiment of Horse later that year. He became Governor of Jersey in May 1723 and Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire in March 1728.

==Later life==
Temple fell out with Prime Minister Robert Walpole in 1733 and formed a faction in the Whig Party to oppose the Excise Bill which resulted in his being stripped of his colonelcy again. He was promoted to full general on 27 October 1735.

Temple provided patronage to the rising star of the Whig Party, William Pitt, securing him a cornet&#x27;s commission in his regiment. The group of Temple&#x27;s young supporters were known as Cobham&#x27;s Cubs and included Richard Grenville, George Grenville and George Lyttelton, as well as Pitt. After Walpole&#x27;s fall as prime minister in 1742, they turned their attacks on his replacement – a government led by Lord Wilmington and Lord Carteret.
Promoted to field marshal on 10 July 1742, Temple became colonel of the 1st Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards that same day, colonel of Viscount Cobham&#x27;s Regiment of Horse in 1744 and colonel of Viscount Cobham&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons in June 1745. He died at Stowe on 13 September 1749 and was buried there.

==Family==
In September 1715 Temple married Anne Halsey, daughter of Edmund Halsey who had owned the Anchor Brewery: her inheritance allowed Temple to maintain the Stowe estate; they had no surviving children. (Their daughter, Elizabeth, was born on 1 September 1738, and baptised at St James&#x27; Church, Westminster, on 28 September. She died shortly before her 4th birthday and was buried on the family estate on 16 July 1742). Cobham came to an agreement with his heirs, distant cousins on whom the estate would have been entailed, on order to favour the family of his sister Hester Grenville. Hester&#x27;s eldest son would take the name Grenville-Temple and eventually inherit the title 2nd Viscount Cobham and the estates of Wotton and Stowe.

==Legacy==

Temple was admired by Alexander Pope, and Temple&#x27;s gardens were praised by Pope in his &quot;Epistle to Burlington&quot; as a wonder. Pope wrote a &quot;moral epistle&quot; to Temple in 1733 and published it in the same year as &quot;An Epistle to the Right Honourable Richard Lord Visct. Cobham&quot;. Pope praises Temple as a practical man of the world whose &quot;ruling passion&quot; was service to his country, whatever the cost. Basil Williams said Temple &quot;had all the coarse, roystering bluffness of the hardened old campaigners of that time&quot;.

<doc id="408410" wikidata="Q7339072" url="?curid=408410" title="Rizal Day bombings">
<text>The Rizal Day bombings, also referred to as the December 30 bombings, were a series of bombings that occurred around Metro Manila in the Philippines on December 30, 2000. The explosions occurred within a span of a few hours, killing 22 people and injuring over 100 others.

The blasts occurred during a national holiday in the Philippines, where December 30 is known as Rizal Day, commemorating the martyrdom of the country&#x27;s national hero, José Rizal.

==Blast locations==

Five locations were bombed almost simultaneously within the span of an hour. All of the locations were situated within Metro Manila on the island of Luzon.

*A bomb exploded at Plaza Ferguson in Malate, Manila, less than a hundred meters from the United States Embassy.
*Another detonated at a gasoline station just outside the Makati central business district. The site was along EDSA, across the street from the Dusit Hotel in Makati. Two members of the local police bomb squad died as a result.
*The cargo handling area of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) was also targeted with at least one explosive device.
*Another device was detonated inside a bus traveling along EDSA. The bomb exploded while the bus was in the Cubao area of Quezon City. One passenger was killed, while several others were injured.
*The explosion that claimed the most casualties occurred in a train cab at the Blumentritt station of the LRT Line 1 in Santa Cruz, Manila.

==Type of explosive employed==
The Philippine National Police identified the bombs as comprising one-kilogram black-powder, detonated using timing devices. In addition, confessions by the convicted perpetrators describe the bombs as made of ammonium nitrate-based explosives. Most of the components, such as blasting caps and detonation cords, were discovered to have come from the city of Talisay in the southern province of Cebu. The town is known for the production of blasting caps used in illegal fishing.

==Perpetrators==
Initially, various Islamic groups were suspected of the bombings, including the Jemaah Islamiyah, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and the Moro National Liberation Front.

In September 2003, almost three years after the incident, the case remained unsolved for which the authorities responsible were berated by then-senate president Franklin Drilon.

In May 2003, Saifullah Yunos (a.k.a. Mukhlis Yunos), a suspect in the bombings, was arrested in the southern city of Cagayan de Oro as he was about to board a plane to Manila. Police were alerted to the suspect when he failed to explain bandages on his face and arms. A month later, he confessed to a level of involvement in the bombings. A member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front&#x27;s special operations group, he was charged with multiple murders and attempted murders for his role in the bombings.

In the following years, several members of the Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested for their suspected involvement in the bombings. In 2004, two Muslim men, Mamasao Naga (a.k.a. Zainal Paks) and Abdul Pata (a.k.a. Mohamad Amir) were arrested by Philippine armed forces in Marawi City. They were supposedly identified by Fathur Rahman Al-Ghozi, a known member of the Jemaah Islamiyah, as the ones responsible for the LRT-1 train cab bombing.

The MILF and the MNLF were later cleared by the Philippine National Police of any involvement in the attacks.

Fathur Rahman Al-Ghozi, an Indonesian national and member of the known terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah, was convicted and sentenced to 17 years in prison for illegal possession of explosives in relation to the Rizal Day bombing incidents. In July 2003, Al-Ghozi, along with several other accomplices, escaped from their holding cell at Camp Crame. Al-Ghozi was later killed in a firefight with Philippine authorities on October 13, 2003.

On January 23, 2009, the three Rizal Day bombers, Mukhlis Hadji Yunos, Abdul Fatak Paute, and Mamasao Naga, were sentenced by the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 29, under Judge Cielito Mendaro-Grulla, for up to 20 years in imprisonment for multiple murders and multiple attempted murders.

==Aftermath==
In December 2006, almost six years after the bombings, Metro Manila police went on heightened alert due to bomb scares and the prospect of follow-up attacks on the anniversary of the bombings. The AFP followed suit days after, deploying numerous bomb squads and medical teams to both Fort Bonifacio and Luneta. In addition, the PNP&#x27;s Explosives and Ordnance Division and SWAT deployed teams to LRT-1 stations along Taft Avenue, near one of the original bombing sites.

The bombings were briefly mentioned in one of the segments in the 2023 film, &quot;Ang Duyan ng Magiting&quot;, an official entry to the 19th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival.

<text>The Belarusian Agrarian Party (; ) was an agrarian socialist political party in Belarus. It supported the government of Alexander Lukashenko. The leader of the party was Mikhail Rusy, who succeeded Mikhail Shimansky on 15 March 2008.

In August 2023, the party dissolved itself.

== Ideology ==
The party advocates the reform of society on the principles of democratic socialism, the restructuring of the economy on the basis of private and state ownership of the means of production, including land. In agriculture it recognizes the forms: production cooperative, joint-stock company, collective and state farm, peasant farm and small enterprise.

==History==

It was created in 1992 as the United Agrarian Democratic Party of Belarus (; ). On 28 January 1994, it changed its name into Agrarian Party.

At the legislative election in 1995, the party obtained 33 out of 198 seats.

The 1996 constitutional crisis split the party into those who supported Lukashenko and those who, together with Syamyon Sharetski (the first party chairman), remained in the Supreme Soviet.

Syamyon Sharetski did not recognize the results of the 1996 constitutional referendum and did not submit to the decision to dissolve the Supreme Soviet. In July 1999, as the head of the legitimate legislative body recognized by the West, Syamyon Sharetski was adopted in Lithuania, where he stayed for two years. In July 2001, Syamyon Sharetski left for the United States and ceased his political activities.

On September 22, 1999, the party was re-registered.

The IV Party Congress at the end of March 2000 announced its intention to cooperate with the authorities and elected Mikhail Shimansky as its chairman.

On June 12, 2009, the Ministry of Justice of Belarus issued a written warning in connection with the fact that the party did not submit information about its activities to the Ministry.

In 2000 and 2004 it only gained 5 and 3 seats in the House of Representatives, respectively.
In 2008, the party was reduced to one seat. In the 2016 election, the party lost its remaining seat. It regained a seat in the assembly in the 2019 Belarusian parliamentary election.

<text>The Communist Party of Belarus (CPB or KPB; ; ) is a communist and Marxist–Leninist political party in Belarus. The party was created in 1996 and supports the government of president Alexander Lukashenko. The leader of the party is Sergei Syrankov. The party has had more seats in the National Assembly of Belarus than any other party since the 2000 Belarusian parliamentary election, the first national election it participated in. However, most seats in the Belarusian legislature are held by independent politicians.

==Overview==

In 2006, the party suggested merging with the Belarusian Party of Communists (PKB), later known as the Belarusian Left Party &quot;A Just World&quot;. While the Communist Party of Belarus is a pro-presidential party, the PKB was one of the major opposition parties in Belarus. According to Sergey Kalyakin, the chairman of the PKB, the so-called &quot;re-unification&quot; of the two parties was a plot designed to oust the opposition PKB.

The main foreign policy goal of strengthening the party proclaimed national security through the development of Belarus-Russia Union State and the phase reconstruction voluntarily renewed Union nations, strengthening its political and economic independence.

The CPB is part of the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP–CPSU) and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties (IMCWP); it enjoys relations with other communist parties in post-Soviet states and throughout the world to a much greater extent than the PKB, which is affiliated with the Party of the European Left and is considered by many in the region to be &quot;pro-Western.&quot;

At the 2004 parliamentary election, the CPB obtained 5.99% and 8 out of 110 seats in the House of Representatives, 6 seats in 2008 and even less in 2012 - where it won 3 seats.

Because of the party&#x27;s support for President Lukashenko, 17 of its members were appointed by him in the country&#x27;s upper house, the Council of the Republic of Belarus, in 2012.

In 2014, the party increased its representation by obtaining 5 seats.

The party improved its result in the 2016 parliamentary elections, where it won 8 seats and then further increased it in the 2019 elections - where it won 11 seats.

During the 2020–21 Belarusian protests, the Communist Party of Belarus participated in a meeting in support of Alexander Lukashenko.

<text>The People&#x27;s United Party (, PUP) is one of two major political parties in Belize. It is currently the governing party of Belize after success in the 2020 Belizean general election, winning a majority of 26 seats out of 31 in the Belizean House of Representatives. It is a centre-left Christian democratic party. The party leader is Johnny Briceño, who currently serves as the Prime Minister of Belize.

==Overview==

The PUP was founded in 1950 out of the Nationalist Movement, as an anti-colonial party while the country was ruled by the United Kingdom as British Honduras. Under George Cadle Price the PUP played a major role in negotiating Belize&#x27;s self-government in 1964 and eventual independence in 1981. The PUP dominated local British Honduran and later Belizean politics from the mid-1950s until 1984, when it lost to the centre-right opposition United Democratic Party (UDP). The UDP has been the party&#x27;s main opposition since the early 1970s. Under Price&#x27;s leadership, the PUP returned to power in 1989 but was defeated by the UDP again in 1993.

After Price&#x27;s retirement in 1996, the PUP won a landslide victory in 1998 under the leadership of Said Musa. The PUP won 22 of the 29 seats in the House of Representatives in 2003. It subsequently held 21 seats after losing one to the UDP in a by-election in October 2003 after the death of one of its House members.

After nearly 10 years in power under Musa the PUP decisively lost the February 2008 election to the UDP, winning only six out of 31 seats. The party remained in opposition after the 2012 election, in which it gained 8 seats but was narrowly defeated by the UDP, and then lost 2 seats in the 2015 election. In the 2020 elections they won an overwhelming victory, gaining 14 seats and winning in almost all local councils.

*Leigh Richardson (acting) (1953–1956)
*George Cadle Price (1956–1996)

*Francis Fonseca (29 October 2011 – 31 January 2016)
*Johnny Briceño (2008–2011, 2016–present)

==Early history (1941–1952)==

===1940s politics: the trade unions===

Belizean politics in the 1940s was dominated by activists from the trade unions, particularly the Workers and Tradesmen&#x27;s Union (later the General Workers Union, GWU), which had just received its right to organise British Honduran workers. Among the Union&#x27;s leaders (some of whom would later be prominent in the PUP) were Clifford Betson, Antonio Soberanis, Henry Middleton and Nicholas Pollard Sr.

===Coalescing against the British===

Among the favourite places for anti-British sentiment to manifest itself was the Belize Town Board (now City Council), which offered opportunities for anti-colonial elements to gather strength and support from British Hondurans. A group of college-educated students, led by John Smith, George Price, Herbert Fuller and Herman Jex were all elected to positions on the Board and later the Legislative Council, assuring that they would be well placed to act. On December 31, 1949, an incident occurred that would force them to act.

===Devaluation and the People&#x27;s Committee===

On this date, a Saturday, the Governor devalued the British Honduras dollar after previously insisting he would not do so. An ad hoc committee, the People&#x27;s Committee (PC), was formed in January 1950 and began to speak out against this unwelcome act in particular and colonialism in general. Such members as Price and Smith in street corner meetings and Goldson and Richardson behind the printing press of the sympathetic daily the &quot;Belize Billboard&quot;, pressed the issue and sought the support of the Belizean people. A wave of anti-British and anti-colonial sentiment struck British Honduras (or Belize as the PC called it for the first time) that had never before been seen, not even in the 1930s at the height of Belize&#x27;s Labour Movement. The PC found that almost overnight it had become the salvation of the people.

==Formation==

Belizeans rapidly accepted the new party&#x27;s statements against colonialism and exploitation of the masses. On February 12, 1950, a crowd of 10,000 marched to Government House in Belize City and proceeded to stone the houses of supposed pro-British elements. A meeting at the Battlefield Park in central Belize City was teargassed by police, and a state of emergency was imposed until July. It was the first time that Belizeans had spoken so forcefully against British colonial policy and on a national level, featuring men and women. By April, the PC/PUP had infiltrated the General Workers Union and sought to turn it toward a nationalist, socialist perspective. By September 1950, an overworked PC was forced to admit that it had overreached itself and that the work of enlightening British Hondurans was the vein of a political party. Its members agreed unanimously to the dissolving of the PC and the birth of the PUP on September 29, 1950.

===Colonialist response===

A draft constitutional report prepared to examine Belize&#x27;s readiness for development appeared in April 1951. It argued that the British system allowed Belizeans to &quot;(enjoy) the fruits of their labours&quot; and argued that rapid political development in such a multi-ethnic society as Belize&#x27;s was &quot;premature&quot;. Among its complaints was that development was not uniform among all ethnic groups, the dominance of the Creoles, widespread illiteracy, and overall &quot;backwardness&#x27; of Belizeans, especially outside of Belize City. Its views reflected those of the middle class of merchants and colonial supporters who saw no reason for change. The PUP attacked the report, mobilized its supporters against it and declared a break with all things colonial, including the name &quot;British Honduras&quot;; PUP leaders routinely referred to the country as Belize thereafter until the name was officially changed in 1973.

The colonialists also sought to mobilise support, and created a National Party in August 1951 to oppose the PUP; this party drew its support from middle-class Belizeans and British officials. One month earlier the colonial government dissolved the PUP-dominated Belize City Council for neglecting to place a portrait of King George VI in its chambers, and in October jailed PUP leaders Richardson and Phillip Goldson for an article in a local newspaper justifying revolution. Leader John Smith left immediately after that, having failed to persuade the party to fly a &quot;Union Jack&quot; at its meeting to counter statements that Guatemala had been aiding the PUP. In City Council elections of 1952, the party won just three of nine seats, with four going to the National Party and two to independents. The National Party had managed to recruit respectable anti-PUP elements from among women&#x27;s leaders, trade unions and middle-class representatives and presented a better front. Nevertheless, George Price, the only leader to escape the colonial attack, topped the polls. since then the PUP took advantage

==Expansion and dissension (1953–1969)==

===General strike===

The PUP for the moment turned its attention to the labour front. George Price was named head of the GWU in April 1952, and returning leaders Richardson and Goldson called for a &quot;Crusade against Colonialism&quot;. The national holiday, on September 10, was dominated by a PUP-sponsored parade that clearly showed how much it had grown beyond its early years. Another opportunity came in October 1952 after workers at a Stann Creek citrus factory called a strike and were joined by their fellows in the Colonial Development Cooperation, United Fruit Company, Public Works Department and Belize Estate Company sawmill operations. Originally called for two days, the strike lasted 49 days on the support of Belizeans across the country, forcing the colonial government to capitulate and call for negotiations with all of the managements except for the BEC, which shut down its sawmill and left 268 workers jobless. Calls for scab labour were met with violence from demonstrators and a number of people were arrested, but by December 8 some 48 workers were on the job and the GWU called off the strike. Membership in the GWU (and support for the PUP) rose dramatically.

===First national elections===

The new constitution envisioned by the 1951 draft report called for universal adult suffrage and a Legislative Council of nine members. General elections, the nation&#x27;s first, were called for April 28, 1954 and were contested by the PUP, the NP and independent candidates. The PUP stressed anti-colonialism and stood against the proposed British West Indies Federation which they claimed would destroy Belize&#x27;s economy; their opponents continued to argue that the PUP was a front for Guatemala. The GWU proved important in getting out the vote in the districts and provided candidates in certain areas. On election day, 70% of the electorate voted, awarding the PUP eight seats and the National Party 1. A chagrined colonial government pledged to work with the PUP; the cautious victors replied that such a partnership would be welcomed only if it &quot;did not retard the campaign against the colonial system&quot;. The colonials sought every opportunity to wreak havoc within the party. Already, the PUP was divided between a faction led by Richardson and Goldson, who advocated accepting the offer, and Price, who refused to compromise himself.

===Party dissension and colonial mind games===

This party dispute came to a head in the summer of 1956, in which ten central committee members left the Party, including Richardson and Phillip Goldson. A majority in the elected government, they nonetheless felt threatened by the overwhelming support in the street for Price, who controlled the rank and file through his connection with the GWU. Price was thereafter undisputed leader of the party, and went unchallenged for nearly four decades as such. As a minor result of the resignations, the GWU lost its popularity and this signalled the end of Labour&#x27;s attempt to control the country&#x27;s movement. The prodigal members had an equally hard time of it: their new party, in elections of March 1957, managed just 17% of voter popularity and overall voter turnout dropped to 63%.

A pleased colonial government now turned up the heat full blast on George Price. They dismissed him from the Executive Council on the old charge of selling out to Guatemala, giving his opponents something to work with; although Belizeans still debate the relationship between Price and Guatemala, the charges were not immediately serious. In March 1958, a protracted charge of sedition was laid on him for supposedly uncomplimentary remarks about the possible reception of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in Belize. A jury acquitted him and the charges backfired. Moreover, the PUP achieved its greatest electoral dominance in 1961 elections, sweeping all eighteen seats from the hapless National Independence Party.

===Working toward self-government===

In contrast with its early years of mass action against the colonial order, the PUP of the 1960s was more focused on change from within. In October 1961, Hurricane Hattie arrived on the shores of Belize City, causing destruction in the de facto capital. The PUP immediately began calling for the moving of the capital to higher ground, to escape flooding. This demand led to the construction of Belize&#x27;s current capital, Belmopan, later in the decade, and of the village of Hattieville, 16 miles from the city, to host the hurricane&#x27;s evacuees. It also showed that George Price&#x27;s vision for the country was national, rather than insular.

As of 1959, a women&#x27;s arm of the Party, the United Women&#x27;s Group (UWG), was created under Gwendolyn Lizarraga, later Belize&#x27;s first female Minister; its task was to mobilise Belize&#x27;s women to eradicate poor conditions in housing and urban development. Its efforts were mixed at best and illustrate the PUP&#x27;s unwillingness to allow women much room in the march to development, preferring them to depend on their male counterparts in government.

On January 1, 1963, Belize achieved internal self-government, the last step before full independence. All matters outside of foreign affairs and national defence would now be the province of the government. The British also retained the public service, including bureaucrats and police, and internal security, meaning that loyalty was a higher priority than development and forcing Price to actively recruit the middle class to the PUP&#x27;s side.

The PUP in this era presided over the shift from forestry to agriculture, the rise of the sugar industry, reforms to labour laws, land distribution, infrastructural development and increased social services contributing to a general improvement in the standard of living.

==1970s and early 1980s: new challenges==

As the PUP moved into the 1970s, it controlled the nation of Belize like never before. It had not lost an election, general or municipal, ever, and enjoyed the confidence of the Belizean people. But new challenges arose that would ultimately lessen Belizeans&#x27; confidence in the PUP.

===UBAD and PAC===

In 1968, students began returning from abroad with a serious sense of the kind of development Belize needed to stay afloat in the modern world. Evan X Hyde, a young black middle-class Creole, graduated Dartmouth College, a predominantly white school, with an A.B. in English in 1968. He formed the United Black Association for Development (UBAD) in early 1969 and began seriously attacking the PUP&#x27;s economic and social policies, equating them with neo-colonialism and denouncing them as &quot;politricks&quot;. He joined trained lawyers Said Musa and Assad Shoman in the formation of their People&#x27;s Action Committee (PAC), which was against &quot;the North Atlantic economic domination (of Belize)&quot; (Shoman) and in the analogue movement RAM (Revolutionary Action Movement) formed by a fusion of the two. Though none of these movements lasted for very long, they all left serious impressions on the psyche of the PUP, which prided itself on being the party of the people. The PUP first tried to silence them, stripping the latter of their jobs and laying charges of sedition, housebreaking and robbery on the former, all of which he dodged. When that did not work, they tried coopting them: Shoman and Musa later played prominent roles in the PUP and Hyde was thereafter relatively quiet in defence of or opposition to them. However, the party was shown to be indecisive in its handling of the two groups.

===UDP and dwindling fortunes===

At the formation of the United Democratic Party, a combination of the NIP, PDM and Liberal oppositions, it was thought that they could not present a worthy challenge to the ruling party. What happened next proved otherwise. The UDP proceeded, under Dean Lindo, to come within 18 votes of throwing the 18 seat Belize House of Representatives into deadlock, seized control of the Belize City Council from the PUP (for the first time in two decades) and winning municipal votes in 1975, 1977 and 1978. While Belizeans still wanted independence, it was felt that the UDP needed an opportunity to prove themselves in government. The results of the 1979 elections showed that the UDP had not quite passed that test, particularly because of their demands for a delayed independence due to Guatemala&#x27;s claim to Belize remaining unsettled. While the PUP eventually fended off this initial UDP challenge, their policy on Guatemala and independence at any cost would prove the party&#x27;s undoing.

===Heads of Agreement and decline===

On January 30, 1981, Premier Price presented to the house a paper with suggestions for the new constitution to come into effect on the eve of independence, which the United Nations maintained had to be no later than the end of 1981 when it supported Belize in a resolution at its 1980 meeting. On March 11, Price, Assad Shoman and other Belizean negotiators returned with a series of proposals they called the &quot;Heads of Agreement&quot;, though nothing had actually been agreed on. The sixteen clauses called for Belize to make tough choices in order for the claim to be dropped, but Belizeans rebelled and set the country afire, forcing a state of emergency. It was under this state of emergency that Belize gained independence on September 21, 1981, a hollow victory that came at the price of losing Belizeans&#x27; trust. The PUP, hanging on for three more years despite economic losses and general discontent, finally called a general election for December 1984, and lost, 21–7, to the UDP. In many ways, it was the end of an era.

==Reform and resurgence==

The PUP for much of the 1980s was heavily divided and out of ideas, characterised by intra-party fights such as the 1983 national convention in which Said Musa challenged Louis Sylvester, or occasional disputes between the so-called &quot;left wing&quot; of Shoman and Musa and the &quot;right wing&quot; of Sylvester, Ralph Fonseca and persons considered to be the chief financiers of the PUP. In 1986, Musa won the chairmanship position and began recruiting new faces into the party. The immediate result of this was improvement in municipal elections in the late 1980s and a close general election victory in 1989. In its first post-independence term the PUP hardly shied away from the same economic policy the UDP had utilised, involving economic growth by improving services. An early election in 1993 cost the PUP a chance to stay in power; a victorious alliance of the UDP and National Alliance for Belizean Rights forced the PUP to become the opposition party for a second time. The party lost the 1993 elections despite polling more votes overall than the UDP. The PUP had only been outpolled in popular votes previously in 1984. The PUP did internal repairs to the party hierarchy at national conventions in May 1994 and November 1996; the latter saw the resignation of George Price as party leader. Said Musa defeated Florencio Marin Sr. in the ensuing convention to name a new leader. After winning municipal votes in 1996 and 1997 and the general elections in 1998, the PUP were riding high once again.

==Today==

The PUP led Belize to eight consecutive years of growth, despite serious external and internal shocks to the traditional and non-traditional bases of the economy.

In 2004, several ministers resigned from Cabinet citing inability to work within the current system. The party wooed them back almost immediately, but aftershocks from this incident continue to affect the party.

Belizeans today are more sceptical of the party than ever before due to constant accusations of corruption which it says are falsified. The 2005 protests in Belize highlighted some of these claims.

Following the PUP&#x27;s defeat in the 2008 election, Musa and Fonseca announced that they were resigning from their leadership positions. Musa said that the PUP needed to &quot;renew itself from the top&quot;.

On March 30, 2008, Johnny Briceño was elected as the leader of the PUP at a party convention in Belmopan, succeeding Musa. He defeated Francis Fonseca, who was considered to be the candidate preferred by the party establishment, receiving 330 votes against 310 for Fonseca.

A special convention was called for April 13, 2008 in Briceño&#x27;s stronghold of Orange Walk.

On October 17, 2010, the PUP held their national convention in Dangriga in which Hon. Johnny Briceno was endorsed as the Party Leader. Carolyn Trench-Sandiford, a former party chair, was elected the PUP&#x27;s (and Belize&#x27;s) first ever female deputy leader.

On October 20, 2011, Francis Fonseca was endorsed at a meeting of the party&#x27;s National Executive in Belize City as the new PUP leader following the resignation of Hon. Johnny Briceno on October 7. Fonseca was formally endorsed as party leader of the People&#x27;s United Party at a special convention on October 29, 2011.

Following the general election in November 2015, Fonseca resigned as party leader. A national convention was held on January 31, 2016 to elect a new leader. Johnny Briceño returned as leader as the party with 1122 votes to Fonseca&#x27;s 917.

===Media===

&quot;The Belize Times&quot; was established by George Price in 1956 and publishes once a week from party headquarters at Queen Street. Its current editor is Jose Jimenez. Vibes Radio was established in 2002 as the official party station. Its manager is Gerald Garbutt.

<doc id="408415" wikidata="Q128906" url="?curid=408415" title="Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz">
<text>Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi ( ; 1 May 18544 June 1931) was an Arab leader from the Banu Qatadah branch of the Banu Hashim clan who was the Sharif and Emir of Mecca from 1908 and, after proclaiming the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, King of the Hejaz, even if he refused this title, from 1916 to 1924. He proclaimed himself Caliph after the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 and stayed in power until 1925 when Hejaz was invaded by the Saudis. His Caliphate was opposed by the British and French empires, the Zionists and the Wahhabis alike. However, he received support from a large part of the Muslim population of that time and from Mehmed VI. He is usually considered as the father of modern pan-Arabism.

In 1908, in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution, Hussein was appointed Sharif of Mecca by the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II. His relationship with the Ottoman government deteriorated after the Committee of Union and Progress took power, particularly because of their policies of Turkification and persecution of ethnic minorities, including Arabs. In 1916, with the promise of British support for Arab independence, although it is debated as to what extent the British were influential in his choice, he proclaimed the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, accusing the Committee of Union and Progress of violating tenets of Islam and limiting the power of the sultan-caliph. While his armies, led by his sons, were engaged in fighting the Ottoman and German troops in the Middle East, Hussein supported the Armenians during the Armenian genocide and saved up to 4,000 of them. In the aftermath of World War I, Hussein refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, in protest of the Balfour Declaration, a document supporting the Jewish settlers in Palestine, and the establishment of British and French mandates in Syria, Iraq, and Palestine. His sons Faisal and Abdullah were made rulers of Iraq and Transjordan respectively in 1921.

He later refused to sign the Anglo-Hashemite Treaty and thus was left in a very precarious position, the British decided progressively to stop supporting him after the proclamation of his caliphate and the refusal to sign any treaty with them. Thus, they decided to support Ibn Saud, who promptly launched an invasion of the Kingdom of Hejaz. In October 1924, facing defeat by Ibn Saud, he abdicated and was succeeded as king by his eldest son Ali bin Hussein. After Hejaz was subsequently completely invaded by the Ibn Saud-Wahhabi armies of the Ikhwan, on 23 December 1925, Hussein surrendered to the Saudis, bringing the Kingdom of Hejaz, the Sharifate of Mecca and the Sharifian Caliphate to an end.

Hussein was then sent into exile to Cyprus, where the British kept him prisoner until his health deteriorated so much that they allowed him to go back to Amman, next to his son Abdullah I of Jordan. He died in Amman in 1931 and was buried as a Caliph in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound.

==Biography==

=== Ascendance and early life ===

==== Ascendance ====

Hussein bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Abd al-Mu&#x27;in bin Awn was born in Constantinople in 1853 or 1854. He was the eldest son of Sharif Ali bin Muhammad, who is the second son of Muhammad bin Abd al-Mu&#x27;in, the former Sharif of Mecca. As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, he was a descendant of Muhammad in the 37th generation through his grandson Hasan bin Ali. His mother, Salah Bani-Shahar, the wife of Ali, would have been a Circassian.

He belonged to the Dhawu Awn clan of the Abadilah, a branch of the Banu Qatadah tribe. The Banu Qatadah had ruled the Sharifate of Mecca since the accession of their ancestor Qatadah ibn Idris in 1201 and were the last of the four branches of Hashemite sharifs who, together, had governed Mecca since the 11th century.

==== Power struggles and birth ====
In 1827, Muhammad bin Abd al-Mu&#x27;in was appointed Sharif, the first Sharif of the Dhawu Awn branch and interrupting the centuries-long dominance of the Dhawu Zayd. He reigned until 1851, when he was replaced by Sharif Abd al-Muttalib ibn Ghalib of the Dhawu Zayd, the very same Sharif whom Muhammad ibn al-Abd al-Mu&#x27;in had succeeded. After being deposed, he sent his family and sons to reside in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. While there Hussein was born to Muhammad&#x27;s son, Ali, in 1853–1854.

Muhammad was reinstated to power in 1856, and Hussein, then two or three years old, accompanied his father and grandfather to Mecca. Soon after, in 1858, Muhammad died and was succeeded by his eldest son, Emir and Sharif Abdullah Pasha, Hussein&#x27;s uncle who held the Sharifate until 1877. While still young, he returned to Mecca after his father&#x27;s death, when his uncle Sharif Abdullah called them back, with his mother in 1861–1862.

==== Youth and education ====
Hussein was raised at home, unlike other Hashemite youth who were typically sent outside the city to grow up among Bedouin nomads. Apparently a diligent young man, he mastered the principles of the Arabic language and was also educated in Islamic law and doctrine. Among his teachers was Sheikh Muhammad Mahmud at-Turkizi ash-Shinqiti, with whom he studied the seven Mu&#x27;allaqat. With Sheikh Ahmad Zayni Dahlan, he studied the Quran, completing its memorization before the age of 20.
During Abdullah&#x27;s reign, Hussein became familiar with the politics and intrigue surrounding the Sharifian court. He also participated in numerous expeditions to the Najd and the eastern regions of Hejaz to meet the Arab tribes, over whom the Sharifate of Mecca then exerted a loose form of control. He learned the customs of the Bedouins, including the skills necessary to withstand the harsh desert environment. During his travels, he also gained a thorough knowledge of the desert&#x27;s flora and fauna and composed poems in humayni verse, a type of vernacular poetry (malhun) of the Bedouins. He also practiced horseback riding and hunting.

==== Exile to Constantinople ====
In 1875, he married Abdullah&#x27;s daughter, Abdiyah, his cousin. In 1877, Abdullah died, and Hussein, along with his cousin Ali ibn Abdullah, received the rank of Pasha. After a series of political assassinations among his uncles vying for the position of Sharif, he gained attention for his independence of thought and was sent back to Constantinople by the reigning uncle at that time in 1892–1893. He remained there for 15 years, until 1908, mainly focusing on raising his children, learning the politics of the Sublime Porte—where he aligned with the conservative faction—and hoping to return home.

=== As Emir ===
==== Appointment ====
Following the removal of his predecessor in October and the sudden death of his successor shortly thereafter, Hussein was appointed grand sharif by official decree of the sultan Abdul Hamid II in November 1908. However, the situation was peculiar for Hussein, who arrived in Mecca in the midst of the Young Turk Revolution, which brought the Young Turks (CUP) to power. Upon his arrival, he met CUP representatives who greeted him as the &quot;Constitutional Sharif,&quot; intending to gauge his response to such a designation. He replied: &quot;Verily these are the lands of Allah in which nothing will ever stand except the Shariah of Allah [...] The constitution of the lands of Allah is the Shariah of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet&quot;.

==== Religious stances ====

His main teacher was Ahmad Zayni Dahlan, with whom he became a hafiz. He had a Shafi&#x27;i and Hanafi education, but also allied with the Malikis and opposed the Wahhabis, at a time when adherence to a madhhab was more fluid.

==== Campaign in &#x27;Asir (1911) ====
In 1911, Hussein became involved in an Ottoman campaign in &#x27;Asir; the Young Turks requested his support to fight Muhammad ibn Ali al-Idrisi, who had recently revolted there and proclaimed the Idrisid Emirate. Hussein was very supportive of this campaign because &#x27;Asir traditionally belonged to the Hejaz, and al-Idrisi presence in the area severed his financial and political ties with &#x27;Asir. He gathered an army of about 5,000 men from the Aqil and Bisha tribes, both tribes being from &#x27;Asir, in Mecca and then began to march against al-Idrisi. After an initial defeat due to the heat and a cholera epidemic, he managed to inflict two heavy defeats on the Idrisid forces.

Then, he managed to break the siege of Abha, which was being conducted by al-Idrisi forces and where Suleiman Pasha, the Ottoman governor of the city, was entrenched. Overall, he was able to defeat the opposing forces. However, during this campaign, he seems to have been shocked by the violence of the Ottoman troops against the revolted and had a heated dispute with the Ottoman governor of Abha, Suleiman Pasha, after he began wanting to administer the territories he managed to reconquer according to Bedouin and Sharifian norms, as previously. This led to a rupture between the two commanders, and Hussein decided to withdraw from &#x27;Asir after having pursued the defeated Idrisid forces for some time.

It seems that this campaign had a very negative impact on how Hussein viewed the Ottoman presence and actions in the Levant, and it is possible that from this moment on, he was already on the verge of rebellion.

=== The Arab Revolt ===
==== Pan-Arabism and relationship with the Ottomans ====
Although there is no formal evidence suggesting that Hussein bin Ali was inclined towards Arab nationalism before 1916, the rise of Turkish nationalism towards the end of the Ottoman Empire, culminating in the Young Turks Revolution of 1908, strongly displeased the Hashemites and Bedouins. Additionally, the increasing centralization of the Ottoman Empire, the progressive prohibition of Arabic in teaching, Turkification policies, and the settlement of Turkish colonists in Arab areas worried and frightened Arabs throughout the empire.

In 1908, the Hejaz Railway was completed, allowing the Turks to strengthen their control over the Hejaz and provide a rapid response capability to reinforce their garrisons in Mecca and Medina. It was built under constant threat of Arab raids, such as those from the Harb tribe, which demonstrated their hostility towards the project. Furthermore, in April 1915, the Ottoman government began a policy of extermination of the minorities in the Ottoman Empire through various genocides. This frightened the Arabs, who were the largest minority in the Empire, and was openly criticized by Hussein bin Ali.

These oppositions with the Turks became so violent that they overshadowed those that existed in Arab society and Bedouin society; and many rival tribes to the Hashemites rallied behind their leadership.

An independentist and anti-colonial Arab movement developed, mainly in Ottoman Syria, where Arab intellectuals and newspapers called for the restoration of the caliphate in the hands of a Quraysh, and especially for the acquisition of Arab independence from the Ottoman Empire. The relationship between Hussein and the Committee of Union and Progress worsened even more after the discovery and foiling of a plot by Enver Pasha to assassinate Hussein.

All of these points led to a violent rupture between Arab elites and the Ottoman political class, and are reflected in Hussein&#x27;s later proclamation of independence, where he presented his struggle as a religious and anti-colonial one.

Twenty days after the start of the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, Hussein bin Ali&#x27;s son, Faisal, met with the leaders of the revolutionary organization Al-Fatat in Damascus. They assured him of their support in case of revolt and recognized Hussein as the representative of the Arab nation.

When Hussein took up the pan-Arab claims in 1916, after his proclamation of independence, he became the leading figure behind whom the pan-Arabs rallied, and is therefore frequently regarded as the father of pan-Arabism.

During World War I, Hussein initially remained allied with the Ottomans but began secret negotiations with the British on the advice of his son, Abdullah, who had served in the Ottoman parliament up to 1914 and was convinced that it was necessary to separate from the increasingly nationalistic Ottoman administration.

==== Relationship with the British ====
Following deliberations at Ta&#x27;if between Hussein and his sons in June 1915, during which Faisal counselled caution, Ali argued against rebellion and Abdullah advocated action and encouraged his father to enter into correspondence with Sir Henry McMahon; over the period 14 July 1915 to 10 March 1916, a total of ten letters, five from each side, were exchanged between Sir Henry McMahon and Sherif Hussein. McMahon was in contact with British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey throughout, and Grey was to authorise and be ultimately responsible for the correspondence.

The British Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, appealed to him for assistance in the conflict on the side of the Triple Entente. Starting in 1915, as indicated by an exchange of letters with Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in the Sultanate of Egypt, Hussein seized the opportunity and demanded recognition of an Arab nation that included the Hejaz and other adjacent territories as well as approval for the proclamation of an Arab Caliphate of Islam. High Commissioner McMahon accepted and assured him that his assistance would be rewarded by an Arab empire encompassing the entire span between Egypt and Persia, with the exception of British possessions and interests in Kuwait, Aden, and the Syrian coast. However, at that time, the British scarcely thought about the promises made; their primary concern was winning the war and dismantling the Ottoman Empire. The fate of the Arab populations and the division of territory were left for a future date.

According to Ekrem Buğra Ekinci, the links between Hussein and the British should not be overestimated. The deep-rooted reason for the Arab revolt, according to him, remains the persecutions and abuse carried out by the Young Turks against the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire, and is not necessarily linked to British support. This support would therefore be contingent and the revolt would have still occurred without their help. This point was shared at the time by Abbas II of Egypt, the last Khedive of Egypt, even though he was a sympathizer of the Young Turks.

==== The Arab Revolt proper, June 1916 to October 1918 ====
Hussein decided to join the Allied camp immediately, because of information that he would soon be deposed as Sharif of Mecca by the Ottoman government in favor of Sharif Ali Haidar, leader of the rival Zaʻid family. The much-publicized executions of the Arab nationalist leaders in Damascus led Hussein to fear for his life if he was deposed in favour of Ali Haidar. The revolt proper began on 10 June 1916, when Hussein proclaimed the independence of the Kingdom of Hejaz and ordered his supporters to attack the Ottoman garrison in Mecca.
In the Battle of Mecca, there ensued over a month of bloody street fighting between the out-numbered, but far better armed Ottoman troops and Hussein&#x27;s tribesmen. Indiscriminate Ottoman artillery fire, set fire to the veil covering the Kaaba and turned out to be a potent propaganda weapon for the Hashemites, who portrayed the Ottomans as desecrating Islam&#x27;s most holy site. Hashemite forces in Mecca were joined by Egyptian troops sent by the British, who provided much needed artillery support, and took Mecca on 9 July 1916. Also on 10 June, another of Hussein&#x27;s sons, the Emir Abdullah, attacked Ta&#x27;if, a hill station near Mecca, which after an initial repulse settled down into a siege. With the British-Egyptian artillery support, Abdullah took Ta&#x27;if on 22 September 1916.
After this, and for most of the war, Hussein&#x27;s sons directed the fighting ; most notably Faisal, future Faisal I of Iraq, and Abdullah, future Abdullah I of Jordan. Hussein mostly stayed in Mecca to direct the operations, while his sons were fighting. The Arab revolt laid siege to Medina but wasn&#x27;t able to take it for a year, thus impeding the operations. During this battle, the Ottomans killed and deported the civilian Arabic population of Medina into the Syrian desert, an event hidden by the pretense of doing &quot;Seferberlik&quot;, or mobilization. On 30 October 1916, Emir Abdullah called a meeting of &quot;majlis&quot; where he read a letter in which &quot;Husayn ibn Ali was recognized as sovereign of the Arab nation. Then all those present arose and proclaimed him &quot;Malik al-Arab&quot;, King of the Arabs&quot;. During the whole duration of the war, Hussein&#x27;s troops stayed underequipped and lacking artillery – which the Allies didn&#x27;t want to give, seeing that front as utopical and not as important as the fight was in the Western front, among others. This lack of artillery and high mobility ; since most of the troops were mounted Bedouins, pushed them to use guerilla tactics in the desert ; for example by severing Ottoman supplies with the bombings of specific sections of the Hejaz railway.
After the fall of Medina, the Arab troops were able to secure Aqaba quickly and this allowed them to project themselves farther; they still ambushed Ottoman troops, such as during the battle of Wadi Musa, helping themselves with their superior knowledge of the Arabian and Syrian deserts. This conflict was marked by widespread ethnic cleansing directed at non-Turkish populations in the areas affected. The troops of Hussein also committed war crimes, deciding to execute Turkish troops responsible of the Tafas massacre against Arabian civilians, instead of taking them prisoners.

After the fall of Aqaba, the Arab forces, supplemented with British auxiliaries and with the design of joining forces with the British main armies, which were trying to break out of Egypt and Palestine, managed to join them. During the Battle of Megiddo, in September 1918, Hussein&#x27;s troops led by his son Faisal, joined the British forces and managed to utterly destroy the 4th, 7th and 8th Ottoman armies, and push into retreat the Yildirim Army Group, comprising the German Asian Corps and led at the time by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, thus leaving the Palestinian and Arabian front without defence, and finally breaking inside the Ottoman Empire. The battle happened at the same time as the Vardar offensive in the Balkans, which managed to overrun Bulgarian defences, thus opening the Balkans and ultimately Austria-Hungary. Since the war was seemingly won, and the Ottoman defences were crumbling, Faisal projected himself towards Damascus, which he took the 1st of October 1918. After this, he engaged in the pursuit to Haritan, pursuing the remnants of the Yildirim Army Group and ultimately taking Aleppo on the 25 of October 1918, thus ending the war on that front.

=== King of Hejaz ===

The US State Department quotes an aide-mémoire dated 24 October 1917 given by the Arab Bureau to the American Diplomatic Agency in Cairo confirming that &quot;...Britain, France and Russia agreed to recognize the Sherif as lawful independent ruler of the Hejaz and to use the title of &quot;King of the Hejaz&quot; when addressing him, and a note to this effect was handed to him on December 10, 1916&quot;.
When Hussein declared himself King of the Hejaz, he also declared himself King of the Arab lands (&quot;malik bilad-al-Arab&quot;). This only aggravated his conflict with Abdulaziz ibn Saud, which was already present because of their differences in religious beliefs and with whom he had fought before the First World War, siding with fellow anti-Saudis, the Ottomans in 1910.

==== Rule ====
Hussein initiated a series of reforms, including measures to avoid offending Muslims from French or British colonies who undertook the Hajj. He also addressed the issue of stray dogs, attempted to ensure the security of the Hajj routes, and sought to combat the prevalent slave markets in the Hejaz region.

He undertook the last major restoration of the Masjid al-Haram in 1920 and a restoration of the mosques of Palestine and more specifically of al-Aqsa mosque, for which he funded 26,672 liras.

==== Armenian genocide ====
Starting from 1917, Hussein made decisions to protect the Armenian refugees and those residing in his lands from the Armenian genocide. First, he condemned the genocide publicly as early as 1916, stating &quot;We specifically bring to the world&#x27;s condemnation the atrocities committed against the Greeks and Armenians, atrocities that our holy law can only disapprove of&quot;. In this regard, he promulgated in 1917, in a decree: &quot;In the name of Most Merciful Allah and our prophet Muhammad, we are addressing our Arab brothers (...) to take Armenian refugees in their families, to share with them their belongings – camels, food, shelter, blankets – and share everything that you have in excess, and everything that you can give to people.&quot;
In April 1918, as part of his conquest of the Syrian territories in which the Armenian genocide took place, he issued a decree to protect Armenians from persecution and allow them to settle in peace, in which he ordered :

&quot;What is requested of you is to protect and to take good care of everyone from the Jacobite Armenian community living in your territories and frontiers and among your tribes; to help them in all of their affairs and defend them as you would defend yourselves, your properties and children, and provide everything they might need whether they are settled or moving from place to place, because they are the Protected People of the Muslims (Ahl Dimmat al-Muslimin) – about whom the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah grant him His blessings and peace) said: &quot;Whosoever takes from them even a rope, I will be his adversary on the day of Judgment&quot;. This is among the most important things we require of you to do and expect you to accomplish, in view of your noble character and determination&quot;.The Armenian National Institute considers it to be the oldest declaration by a head of state to recognize the Armenian genocide. Alongside this, he gave citizenship to his Armenian subjects. According to survivors of the Armenian genocide, such as Levon Yotnakhparian, Hussein personally received him and was shocked by the news of what was happening. He also supported Armenian survivors and provided men and protection for expeditions in the Syrian desert aimed at rescuing Armenian deportees. According to testimonies, this method is said to have saved up to 4,000 people from the genocide, in collaboration with Hussein al-Attrache, a Druze chieftain who then disguised the refugees as Druzes. His son, Faisal, provided free transportation to all Armenian refugees for their trip towards the British refugee camp in Damascus and free use of the Hejaz railway ; even if that meant impeding on the war effort.

=== Following World War I ===
In the aftermath of the war, the Arabs found themselves freed from centuries of Ottoman rule. Hussein&#x27;s son Faisal was made King of Syria, but this kingdom proved short-lived, as the Middle East came under mandate rule of France and the United Kingdom. The British Government subsequently made Faisal and his brother Abdullah kings of Iraq and Transjordan, respectively.

==== The issue of Palestine and deterioration in British relationship ====
Starting at the end of the war, Hussein found himself in severe conflict with Britain&#x27;s views on the subject of Palestine. In January and February 1918, Hussein received the Hogarth Message and Bassett Letter in response to his requests for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and Sykes-Picot Agreement respectively. Despite their explanations, he stated that Palestine should be included within the borders of the newly founded Arab Kingdom and should refuse Zionist settlers, even if he was ready to accept Jewish people in Palestine, notably those who already lived there and were not coming from foreign countries. However, even after an assurance by McMahon, Hussein did not receive the lands promised by their British allies. McMahon claimed that the proposed lands to be taken in by the new Arab State were not purely Arab. In actuality, McMahon refused to hand over the new lands as the areas in question had already been claimed by the new British ally, France.

Having received a British subsidy totalling £6.5m between 1916 and April 1919, in May 1919, the subsidy was reduced to £100K monthly (from £200K), dropped to £75K from October, £50K in November, £25K in December until February 1920 after which no more payments were made.

The British were not disposed to fulfill their promises to Hussein, as Colonel Wilson stated in secret correspondence :&quot;At one time, our Arabic copies of Sir H. MacMahon&#x27;s letters to the Grand Sherif could not be found; if they are still unavailable it may be somewhat awkward when King Hussein produces the originals. (...) Failing a satisfactory solution King Hussein will have some grounds for considering that Great Britain has broken her pledged word.&quot;In 1919, King Hussein refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. In August 1920, five days after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, Curzon asked Cairo to procure Hussein&#x27;s signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of £30,000 conditional on signature. Hussein declined and in 1921, stated that he could not be expected to &quot;affix his name to a document assigning Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to foreigners&quot;. He refused again to accept the Balfour Declaration in 1923, and stated : &quot;I look at the people of Palestine as I look at my own family, without distinction between Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or nationalist&quot;.

In January 1924, Hussein received in Amman a Zionist delegation led by rabbi Yaakov Meir and a British colonel. Despite having welcomed them with respect, he would not change his position. As his stance was seen by the United Kingdom as extremist, the British and the Zionist media engaged in press campaigns against Hussein, where his positions were misrepresented. They also engaged heavily against his Caliphate, calling it illegitimate. After him becoming Caliph, he continued on this path, stating: &quot;I consider Zionism unjust towards Muslims, Christians and Orthodox Jews, and as a protector of justice, I will resist this unjust Zionism&quot;. This contributed to aggravate his relationship with the Zionists towards a breaking point.

==== Caliphate ====
After the Caliphate was abolished by the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Hussein was proclaimed as Caliph. The accounts on the official date and proceedings vary, some place the beginning of the Caliphate on 3 March 1924, when Hussein would have declared himself Caliph at his son Abdullah&#x27;s winter camp in Shunah, Transjordan. Other accounts, such as a Reuters dispatch, instead set the date as March 7, 1924, and describe Hussein bin Ali being elected as a caliph by Muslims from &quot;Mesopotamia, Transjordan, and Hejaz&quot;. A third counting of the official date takes place when he received the homage of the majority of the Arab population in Amman as the caliph, on March 11, 1924. Finally, a fourth version places the date on Friday, March 14, 1924, when Hussein is evidently enthroned as caliph in Baghdad during the Friday prayer. In any case, all sources agree on a date in March 1924, shortly after the abolition of the Ottoman caliphate by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Separately, he made statements in support of the Ottoman dynasty, which had been ruined and exiled from Turkey. In this regard, he declared:The services rendered by the Ottoman family to Islam and Muslims are undeniable; their heroism cannot be belittled. The recent decision regarding the family [exile] has pierced the hearts and saddened the spirits of Muslims. Therefore, we see it as an obligation of Islamic brotherhood to meet the needs of the family and prevent them from experiencing financial difficulties. Those who wish to participate in this great endeavor should express their intentions to our representatives in Mecca.

In the same perspective, he financially supported the members of the exiled Ottoman dynasty to prevent them from being ruined. Despite his complicated financial and economic situation, he provided them with 2400 liras. The claim to the title was recognized by a large part of the Hejazi, Levantine and more generally Arabic Muslim population. He also received the support of Mehmed VI, on March 18, 1924, one of the last Ottoman Caliphs and the last Ottoman Sultan, according to &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Vatan&quot;, that reported that he supported him as the new Caliph.

The French viewed this proclamation as &quot;the worst possible solution,&quot; in the words of Hubert Lyautey, who also defended that the Ottoman Caliphate was better for French interests than the Sharifian Caliphate. They believed that having a new influential caliph could risk reviving pan-Islamism, causing instability in French Muslim colonies in the event of a conflict, and potentially giving the Red Sea to the British. As a result, the French did not support it at all, preferring to wait and see how events unfolded. Meanwhile, they had the Sultan of Morocco ready to assume the caliph title if necessary, offering the French a caliph who was more aligned with their interests, albeit less significant.

To reinforce his proclamation and establish legal foundations for his caliphate, Hussein convened an Islamic Congress at Mecca in 1924, it comprised both Sunni and Shia Muslims and was thus arguably one of the most inclusive Islamic Congresses in history. The Congress held twelve sessions before being indefinitely adjourned due to the advance of Saudi forces.

His Caliphate only lasted for a few months, though, because he was invaded and defeated quickly by Abdulaziz ibn Saud.

==== Defeat against Saudis and abdication ====
Although the British had supported Hussein from the start of the Arab Revolt and the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, they not only chose not to help him to repel the Saudi conquest of Hejaz, but even provided weapons to Ibn Saud, which eventually took Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah. The British offered several times to assist him and to stop supporting the Saudis, in exchange for his recognition of the Balfour Declaration, which he refused each time. According to the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought, the British not only supported Ibn Saud against Hussein bin Ali but they also supported him subsequently against the Ikhwan. Hussein attempted to make appeals to the League of Nations, Muslim powers, and Western powers; however, they did not intervene and merely monitored the events. The British were highly negative towards him since he assumed the caliphal title and refused to support him.

He chose to abdicate. After his abdication, another of his sons, Ali, briefly assumed the throne of the Hejaz, but then he too had to flee from the encroachment of the Saudi forces. Another of Hussein&#x27;s sons, Faisal, was briefly King of Syria and later King of Iraq, while Abdullah was Emir of Transjordan. While he was in exile, he still used the title of caliph until his death.

==== Exile ====

King Hussein was then forced to flee to Amman, Transjordan, where his son Abdullah was Emir. During this period, King Hussein is described as having taken over control that his son wielded, and therefore was sent to live in Aqaba (which was recently transferred from Hijazi to Transjordanian sovereignty by the British). Britain – responding to Ibn Saud&#x27;s plea that the Sharif be expelled from Aqaba – exiled him from Aqaba to British-controlled Cyprus.

He lived in Nicosia from 1925, with his sons coming to visit him at some times, even if his relationships with them were strained, except for Zeid who came to visit him the most. According to the British governor of Cyprus, Ronald Storrs, when he went to see Hussein, he found his son Zeid reading him the commentary of al-Bukhari on the Quran. He rarely left his home, lived an austere lifestyle, and read the Quran, religious books, he also read Arabic newspapers in the mornings. However, he still went to see horse-races and had brought Arabic horses in his exile that he treated &quot;like his own family&quot;. Hussein also did some interviews with the press during his exile. He received some visitors, such as Sheikh Fuad al-Khatib, Muhammad Jamil Bayham, who wanted to write his biography, or the Jordanian poet Mustafa Wahbi Tal, among others. Hussein was ruined, but the local Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot population considered him to be a very wealthy man and therefore tried to win his favors. Meanwhile, he was entangled in legal matters regarding property income in Egypt, among other things.

He tried to be friendly towards the various ethnic communities on the island but was particularly close to the Armenians of the island, seeing them as victims, like himself, of the Young Turks. Hussein did not have any documented connection with the Turkish Cypriot community; though it is possible that one exists, there is no mention of him having visited a Turkish mosque in Nicosia. He met with the Armenian Archbishop of Nicosia in 1926 and received a warm welcome, after that, he donated drums and instruments to the Armenian community of the island, including the Armenian Philharmonic Melkonian School.

He began to fall ill as early as 1928, but his favorite wife, Adila Khanum, passed away in 1929, which exacerbated his illness. She was buried at Hala Sultan Tekke, the largest Muslim shrine on the island. His two sons, Ali and Abdallah, attended the funeral and started making preparations and requesting the British for his repatriation, believing that he didn&#x27;t have much time left to live and that they needed to be by his side.

==== Return and death ====
As his health continued to deteriorate and as he was paralyzed by a stroke at age 79 in 1930, the British became increasingly inclined to send him back to the Middle East. They feared that his death would not only stir resentment among Arabs towards the United Kingdom but also potentially strain their relationships with the Hashemite rulers, all of whom were allies in the Middle East. The Saudis expressed their displeasure with rumors of Hussein&#x27;s repatriation, especially after Hussein expressed his wish to be buried in Mecca, an event the Saudis feared would lead to &quot;pro-Hashemite gatherings.&quot; Eventually, the British decided to repatriate him to Amman, with Baghdad as another option they had considered. Upon his arrival, he was greeted by a large crowd that cheered him and followed him to the Raghadan Palace. There, while in Amman, he published a series of texts in al-Yarmouk, an Arabic newspaper, where he defended his actions and stated once again that he was against the British mandate of Palestine.

He died on June 4, 1931. Hussein bin Ali was buried in Jerusalem in 1931, as he wasn&#x27;t able to be buried in Mecca, as he wanted and as was the norm for Sharifs of Mecca until then, for Ibn Saud didn&#x27;t want to allow him being buried there. Local dignitaries and leaders wanted him to be buried in the al-Aqsa mosque compound. This idea was kept and after a procession where 30,000 people took part, he was buried in Jerusalem: inside the Arghūniyya, a building on the Haram esh-Sharif or &quot;Temple Mount&quot;, in a walled enclosure decorated with white marble and carpets. His son Faisal, with whom the relationship was the worse at that point, didn&#x27;t attend his funerals, claiming he had &quot;government business&quot; to attend to.

On the window above his tomb is written the following inscription: which translates &quot;This is the tomb of the Commander of the Faithful, Hussein bin Ali&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Art===
Several poets wrote about him, including Ahmed Shawqi, nicknamed the Prince of Poets, who wrote a poem about his funerals and Mustafa Wahbi Tal, one of the most prominents Jordanian poets, who wrote a poem about him.

In the early 21st century, Hussein was a regular character in the &#x27;burgeoning&#x27; Jordanian cinema.

=== Armenian genocide refugees ===
His role in the support of Armenian refugees, especially during the Armenian genocide, led him to be cited in 2014 and 2020 by Armenian Presidents Serzh Sargsyan and Armen Sarkissian as an example of tolerance and friendship between people also stressed by Jordanian Prince Hassan bin Talal. Hussein is quoted in the book &quot;Crows of the Desert&quot; from Armenian survivor Levon Yotnakhparian, when he discusses the help Hussein provided to the survivors and to save victims. This book subsequently gave birth to a movie of the same name.

For his actions during the Armenian genocide, Hussein was awarded the title of &quot;Righteous of the Armenian genocide&quot; by Armenian researchers. On Friday 24 April 2015, on the occasion of the centennial of the Armenian genocide, Lebanese Sheikh Maher Hammoud referenced Hussein bin Ali in his sermon condemning the genocide. The Middle East Council of Churches paid hommage to his actions.

===Others===
Several mosques bear his name to the present day, such as the Hussein bin Ali mosque in Aqaba, the Hussein bin Ali mosque in Ma&#x27;an or the al-Husseini mosque in Amman. A school is named after him in Ma&#x27;an. His house in Aqaba was restored in 2023 at the initiative of the Jordanian government and subsequently reopened to the public in 2024. A brigade of the Jordanian army bears his name.

In 2020, a documentary was made about him and his life by Al-Araby, which was seen more than five million times on YouTube as of May 2023. The Order of Hussein bin Ali, created in 1949 by Abdullah I of Jordan, is the highest order of Jordan.

<doc id="408420" wikidata="Q1470113" url="?curid=408420" title="Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)">
<text>The Social Democratic Front () is the main opposition party of Cameroon. It was led by Ni John Fru Ndi from its foundation until his death in 2023, and receives significant support from the Anglophone Southwest and Northwest Regions.

==History==
The SDF was launched in Bamenda on May 26, 1990 in opposition to the ruling Cameroon People&#x27;s Democratic Movement; following the launching rally, six people were killed by security forces. The party held its Constitutive Assembly on February 3, 1991 and elected its National Executive Committee. The party refused to sign the Tripartite Declaration of November 1991, and it chose to boycott the March 1992 parliamentary election, along with the Democratic Union of Cameroon, due to the government&#x27;s failure to meet opposition demands, which included the establishment of an independent electoral commission to oversee the election. However, the party announced at its May 1992 national convention that it would take part in the presidential election later that year. Fru Ndi, the SDF candidate in the October 1992 presidential election, received about 36% of the vote against about 40% for incumbent President Paul Biya, according to official results. The SDF believes he was denied victory &quot;at gunpoint&quot;. He has now been largely criticized in the national press for moving residence to Yaoundé.

The SDF won 43 seats in the National Assembly in the May 1997 parliamentary election, receiving its best results in Northwest Province, where it won 19 out of 20 seats; it also won a majority of seats in West Province, with 15 out of 25. It chose to boycott the October 1997 presidential election, along with the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) and the Cameroon Democratic Union (UDC). In the June 2002 parliamentary election, the SDF won 22 seats; it won one of these seats in a revote held for some constituencies on 15 September. Although the party lost nearly half its seats in the 2002 election, it still dominated in Northwest Province, where it again won 19 out of 20 seats.

In the presidential election held on 11 October 2004, Fru Ndi stood again as the SDF candidate and won 17.4% of the vote according to official results, far behind Biya. In the July 2007 parliamentary election, the SDF won 14 out of the 163 initially declared seats, and it won a further two seats (out of 17 at stake) in constituencies where the election was held over again in September, thus winning a total of 16 out of 180 seats. These additional seats were crucial, because the SDF could not form a parliamentary group unless it had at least 15 seats. The party&#x27;s electoral success remained largely confined to the Northwest Province, where it again won a majority of seats, with 11 out of 20.

The SDF strongly opposed a constitutional amendment allowing Biya to run for president again in 2011. Its deputies boycotted the April 2008 parliamentary vote in which the amendment was approved, and it subsequently called for a &quot;day of mourning&quot; in which people were to wear black and stay home.

One key alliance is between the SDF and the female Takembeng mobilizations. These women provide protection for SDF officials and a key presence at SDF demonstrations.

==International affiliation==
The party is a full member of the Socialist International and Progressive Alliance.

<doc id="408423" wikidata="Q4394948" url="?curid=408423" title="Sir Robert Rich, 4th Baronet">
<text>Field Marshal Sir Robert Rich, 4th Baronet (3 July 1685 – 1 February 1768) was a British Army officer and politician. As a junior officer he fought at the Battle of Schellenberg and at the Battle of Blenheim during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was then asked to raise a regiment to combat the threat from the Jacobite rising of 1715. He also served with the Pragmatic Army under the Earl of Stair at the Battle of Dettingen during the War of the Austrian Succession. As a Member of Parliament he represented three different constituencies but never attained political office.

==Career==
Born the son of Sir Robert Rich, 2nd Baronet and Mary Rich (née Rich, daughter of Sir Charles Rich, 1st Baronet), Rich was commissioned as an ensign in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and lieutenant in the Army on 10 June 1700.

He fought in the War of the Spanish Succession at the Battle of Schellenberg in July 1704, where he was wounded, and at the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704, where he was wounded again. Promoted to lieutenant in the Brigadier-General Tatton&#x27;s Regiment and captain in the Army, he succeeded his brother Charles as 4th Baronet in October 1706, and was then promoted to captain in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and lieutenant-colonel in the Army in March 1708. In June 1708 he fought a duel with Sir Edmund Bacon, 4th Baronet who was wounded but survived.

When the threat of the Jacobite rising of 1715 became apparent Rich was asked to raise a regiment which subsequently became known as the 18th Dragoons. That year he was also elected Member of Parliament for Dunwich. In June 1717 he was stripped of his regiment for voting against the Government on a motion accusing Lord Cadogan of fraud and embezzlement during the transport of some Dutch troops. He was defeated in the general election in 1722 but having strongly supported Sir Robert Walpole, firstly when Walpole was in opposition and then when Walpole was in the Government, was rewarded with the colonelcy of the 13th Hussars in November 1722.

He was elected as Member of Parliament for Bere Alston in February 1724 and became colonel of Sir Robert Rich&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons in September 1725. In 1727 he changed constituency to become Member of Parliament for St Ives and was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber to King George II, a position he held until 1759.

Having been promoted to brigadier-general on 15 March 1727, he went on to be colonel of The King&#x27;s Regiment of Carabineers in January 1731, colonel of the 1st Troop Horse of Grenadier Guards in July 1733 and, finally, colonel of the 4th Regiment of Dragoons in May 1735.

Promoted to major-general on 18 December 1735 and lieutenant general on 17 July 1739, Rich became Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in May 1740. He served with the Pragmatic Army under the Earl of Stair at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He also presided over a court martial of Lieutenant-General Thomas Fowke, Governor of Gibraltar, on a charge of disobeying orders in August 1756.

Rich was promoted to general of horse on 24 March 1746 and to field marshal on 3 December 1757. In retirement he continued to live in the family home, Roos Hall in Beccles. He died on 1 February 1768.

==Family==
In 1710 Rich married Elizabeth Griffith; they had three sons, including Sir Robert Rich, 5th Baronet and Sir George Rich, 6th Baronet, and one daughter, Elizabeth, who married George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton.

<text>The New Patriotic Party (NPP; ) is a centre-right and liberal-conservative political party in Ghana. Since the democratisation of Ghana in 1992, it has been one of the two dominant parties in Ghanaian politics, with its leading rival being the centre-left National Democratic Congress (NDC). John Kufuor of the NPP was President of Ghana from 2001 to 2009. At the elections held on 7 December 2004, the party won 129 out of 230 seats. The NPP candidate was Kufuor, who was re-elected as president with 52.75% of the vote. The New Patriotic Party symbol is the African elephant and the New Patriotic Party colours are red, white, and blue.

In the 2008 general election, the NPP candidate Nana Akufo-Addo conceded to losing in the closely contested presidential election runoff amidst accusations of vote rigging, with Akufo-Addo receiving 49.77% of the votes, versus 50.23% for John Atta Mills, the NDC candidate. In the 2012 general election, the NPP faced a similar situation from vote results provided by the Electoral Commission of Ghana (EC). Nana Akufo-Addo received 47.74% of the vote, while NDC candidate John Mahama received 50.7% amidst accusations of electoral fraud. Akufo-Addo was chosen as the NPP&#x27;s candidate for a third time in the 2016 elections and defeated Mahama in the first round (winning 53.83% of the votes).

The New Patriotic Party has so far contested every national general election in Ghana since the commencement of the fourth republic in 1992, with the exception of the parliamentary elections of 1992. The New Patriotic boycotted the 1992 parliamentary elections, alleging that the 1992 presidential election held earlier was rigged. The New Patriotic Party wrote a book title &#x27;Stolen Verdict&#x27; to register its protest against the 1992 presidential election.

The New Patriotic Party is considered as an offshoot of the United Gold Coast Convention, which effectively evolved into the United Party in the late 1950s, the Progress Party in the late 1960s, the Popular Front Party in the 1970s and the All People&#x27;s Party in the early 1980s.

After more than a decade of military rule by Jerry John Rawlings, the government, along with some stakeholders, drafted a constitution for which a Referendum election was organized. After the people of Ghana approved the new constitution in an election (held on 28 April 1992), the ban on party politics in Ghana was lifted, allowing other parties including the NPP to be officially launched. The NPP&#x27;s flagbearer was Professor Albert Adu Boahen, a scholar and a long-time critic of the Rawlings military government. However, the NPP lost the 1992 election overwhelmingly to the Progressive alliance of the National Democratic Congress, Eagle and the National Convention Party whose candidate was Jerry John Rawlings. The NPP boycotted the parliamentary elections and hence won no seats in the new Parliament.

The NPP also lost the 1996 elections again to Rawlings&#x27; party but this time, their flagbearer was John Kufuor. In the 2000 and 2004 elections, John Kufuor won both elections ushering in a new government for the first time in the fourth republic of Ghana.

==Electoral history==
===1992 elections===
The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Kukurudu lost the 1992 presidential elections to the National Democratic Congress led by Jerry John Rawlings. Despite the elections being declared as free and fair by international observers, Professor Adu Boahen, the NPP candidate, alleged that there was heavy rigging by the Interim National Electoral Commission headed by Nana Oduro Nimapau and hence the NPP as well as the National Independence Party, People&#x27;s Heritage Party and the People&#x27;s National Convention boycotted the parliamentary elections. The decision to not contest in the parliamentary elections which was held a couple of weeks after the presidential election at the time meant that the National Democratic Congress, National Convention Party and the Eagle Party which was already a coalition won almost all the parliamentary seats available. One seat was actually won by an independent candidate, Hawa Yakubu.

This protest however led to some reforms in the electoral system, notably the use of transparent ballot boxes at polling stations, issuing of voter ID cards and the use of indelible ink (which lasted for a month) to mark people who had been registered to avoid double voting.

After more than a decade of military rule by Jerry John Rawlings, the government, along with some stakeholders, drafted a constitution for which a Referendum election was organized. After the people of Ghana approved the new constitution in an election (held on 28 April 1992), the ban on party politics in Ghana was lifted, allowing other parties including the NPP to be officially launched.New Patriotic Party, Biography According to the NPP leadership, figures in certain constituencies had been massaged, hence the results published by the Electoral Commission and the Ghana press (mostly Peace FM online and Ghanaweb) were not accurate.New Patriotic Party, Biography

===1996 elections===
After the defeat in 1992, the NPP chairman at the time, Peter Ala Adjetey, stated that the party was resolved to do their homework and wrestle power from the NDC in the 1996 election. They made the decision that regardless of the results, they would contest for parliamentary seats to stop what was seen as an NDC monopoly in Parliament.

Prior to the party convention, it appeared that the overwhelming favourite to become the next presidential candidate was a well renowned economist known as Kwame Pianim. However, some members of the party led by Florence Ekwam challenged Pianim&#x27;s eligibility due to a prior conviction during the PNDC era. The Supreme Court of Ghana declared Pianim as ineligible and hence he couldn&#x27;t be considered for nomination. On 20 April 1996, John Kufuor was nominated as the NPP presidential candidate with 1034 out of 2000 delegates drawn from all the 200 Constituencies to run for the presidency in the general election held on 10 December 1996. This time, both presidential and parliamentary elections were held on the same day, unlike the previous election, as part of the reforms by the National Electoral Commission headed by Kwadwo Afari-Gyan.

The NPP gained an unlikely association from the vice-president of Ghana, Kow Nkensen Arkaah, whose party (National Convention Party) had severed their alliance with the National Democratic Congress. The NPP hence formed what was deemed as the &quot;Great Alliance&quot; with the NCP and Vice-president Arkaah was nominated to be the running mate of Kuffuor. After campaigning for less than nine months, Kufuor polled 39.62% of the popular votes to Jerry Rawlings&#x27; 57% in the 1996 election. Despite the elections being declared as free and fair by international observers, the New Patriotic Party alleged that the election had been rigged by the National Electoral Commission and President Rawlings. The NPP however won a substantial number of seats in the Ghana parliament and effectively ended the NDC monopoly.

===2000 elections===
On 23 October 1998, Kufuor was re-nominated by the New Patriotic Party to run again for the presidency. President Rawlings, facing term limits, was due to retire after the 2000 elections. Pianim, however, resigned from the NPP and Peter Ala Adjetey, the party chairman, handed over the chairmanship to Samuel Odoi-Sykes. Aliu Mahama stood as the running mate of John Kufuor. The NDC in turn nominated Vice-president John Atta Mills as its presidential candidate.

Kufuor won the first round of the presidential election, held on 7 December 2000, with 48.4% of the popular votes. His closest challenger was Atta Mills with 44.8% of the votes. The electoral rules in Ghana mandate that the winner of elections must cross a 50% threshold. A run off election was hence organised. All the parties came together to support the NPP including the Convention People&#x27;s Party, Reform Party and the United Ghana Movement against the NDC.

In the second round, held on 28 December 2000, Kufour was victorious, taking 56.9% of the vote. When Kufuor was sworn in on 7 January 2001, it marked the first time in history that an incumbent government had peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.

2000 election

The NPP also lost the 1996 elections again to Rawlings&#x27; party but this time, their flagbearer was John Kufuor. In the 2000 elections, John Kufuor won both elections ushering in a new government for the first time in the fourth republic of Ghana.New Patriotic Party, Biography

===2004 elections===
The New Patriotic Party&#x27;s president, John Agyekum Kufuor was once again re-elected in the Ghana general election, 2004, presidential and parliamentary elections held on 7 December 2004, earning 52.45% of the popular vote in the first round and thus avoiding a run-off, while at the same time, the New Patriotic Party, was able to secure more seats in the Parliament.

===2008 elections===
Several government officials within the Kufuor administration resigned their cabinet positions to contest for the NPP flagbearership in July 2007. This included the likes of Nkrabea Effah Dartey, Nana Akufo-Addo, Alan John Kyerematen and 13 other contenders. Akufo-Addo and Kyerematen were the two leading candidates according to the pundits. However, Akufo-Addo won 48% of the votes in the first round of the party delegates election. The NPP set aside a provision in the party&#x27;s constitution which required that candidates obtain 50% + one vote of delegates to secure the party&#x27;s nomination thus making Nana Akufo-Addo the New Patriotic party&#x27;s candidate for the 2008 presidential elections.New Patriotic Party, Biography

In the 7 December 2008 presidential elections, Akufo-Addo placed first and received more votes than John Atta Mills, amassing 4,159,439 votes, representing 49.13% of the total votes cast; however, he fell short of the 50% needed for an outright victory. It was the best-ever performance for a first-time presidential candidate since the beginning of Ghana&#x27;s Fourth Republic in 1992. In the run-off election, however, Mills received 4,521,032 votes, representing 50.23%, and thus defeated Akufo-Addo.

The run-off elections were marred with controversy and once again, although international observers had expressed satisfaction with the way and manner the elections were conducted, the NPP alleged voter fraud. According to the NPP leadership, figures in certain constituencies had been massaged, hence the results published by the Electoral Commission and the Ghana press (mostly Peace FM online and Ghanaweb) were not accurate. Also, NPP activists like Kwabena Agyapong and Elizabeth Ohene were allegedly intimidated in areas of the Volta Region of Ghana, a region where the NPP had never won any constituency. The complaint led to a delay in the declaration of the results, sparking angry NDC demonstrators onto the streets of the capital city Accra. Tony Aidoo, an NDC activist, fired up these NDC protesters by dismissing the NPP claims as &quot;stupid&quot;. The chairman of the electoral commission, Kwadwo Afari Djan, eventually organised a press conference and claimed that the Tain Constituency had some issues and hence another run-off election had to be organised in that constituency alone. After revising the figures, he asserted that although John Atta Mills was leading in the popular votes, the number of registered voters in the Tain constituency were enough to swing the election the other way. Therefore, the final results would be declared after the Tain constituency results had been certified and declared. An election was held in that constituency on 2 January 2009 and Mills won by a very comfortable margin of 90.6% to 4%.

The NPP officially went back into opposition in January 2009 when John Kufuor handed over power to John Atta Mills.

===2012 elections===

On Saturday, 7 August 2010, the New Patriotic Party re-elected Akufo-Addo as its presidential candidate for the 2012 presidential election. Akufo-Addo received the votes of 79% of the delegates. The electoral convention was the largest that any political party had ever convened in any African state. The New Patriotic Party campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, and to provide free SHS (Secondary High School) education for the population of Ghana.

Following Akufo-Addo&#x27;s defeat in the presidential election, the New Patriotic Party and Akufo-Addo contested the vote results provided by the Electoral Commission of Ghana, alleging that the 2012 general elections were rigged. They cited tampered vote counts and vote rigging from polling stations in South Ghana. The New Patriotic Party unsuccessfully asked the Electoral Commission of Ghana and its chairman Kwadwo Afari-Gyan to use the &quot;72 hours withdrawal of election results law&quot; that is written in the constitution of Ghana to &quot;investigate&quot; electoral fraud. The party decided not to concede defeat until an external investigation and a vote recount were completed.

The New Patriotic Party filed a writ with the Supreme Court of Ghana requesting that the results declared by the electoral commission be invalidated. Despite claiming publicly that the election was rigged by the ruling NDC government, their writ in court alleged that there were inconsistencies and irregularities at certain polling stations. Therefore, they wanted the results at those stations to be invalidated. These were in effect polling stations that the NDC won comfortably. Therefore, with figures from those stations (over 11000 of them) invalidated, it would mean that NPP would mathematically be the winners. The Supreme Court of Ghana, headed by Justice Atuguba, gave its final verdict, with the majority opinion stating that even if there were inconsistencies, they were unimportant and could not have altered the election&#x27;s result. Akufo-Addo conceded defeat after the verdict, on 29 August 2013.

===2016 elections===

During the 2016 presidential election, the New Patriotic Party&#x27;s candidate Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President and National Democratic Congress candidate John Mahama, winning 53.85% of the vote. In addition, the NPP won 155 seats during the 2016 parliamentary election, exceeding the 138 quorum needed to form a majority.

John Mukum Mbaku of the Brookings Institution praised Akufo-Addo for showing magnimity in victory and Mahama for conceding defeat, facilitating a peaceful transition process. Mbaku said that the 2016 election solidified Ghana&#x27;s credentials as a country &quot;willing to strengthen its democratic institutions and to enhance its ability to live within the rule of law.&quot; The European Union&#x27;s Election Observation Mission certified the 2016 Ghanaian elections as largely fair and free while acknoledging that the Electoral Commission encountered some problems with communication, voter registration, ballot printing and special voting.

===2020 elections===

During the 2020 presidential election held on 10 December, President and NPP candidate Nana Akufo-Addo was re-elected with 51.59% of the vote, defeating the NDC&#x27;s candidate John Mahama. During the parliamentary election, the incumbent NPP and the opposition NDC parties won 137 seats each. The sole independent candidate joined the NPP, giving the party a one-seat majority. During the 2020 general election, Akufo-Addo campaigned on a $17 billion economic recovery programme to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ghana&#x27;s oil and cocoa exports.

While international observers including the European Union&#x27;s chief observer Javier Nart regarded the 2020 Ghana elections as free and fair, opposition leader Mahama rejected the results, alleging voting irregularities and intimidation by the military. Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah disputed Mahama&#x27;s allegations of voter intimidation. The Ghana Police Service also reported 60 incidents of violence and eight deaths during the election. Mahama also unsuccessfully challenged the results of the 2020 election at the Supreme Court of Ghana. On 4 March 2021, the Supreme Court rejected his legal challenge.

===2024 elections===

During the 2024 presidential election, Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia stood as the NPP&#x27;s candidate against NDC leader and former President John Mahama. The 2024 general election occurred against the backdrop of an economic recession, rising food prices, a record unemployment rate of 14.7%, corruption and illegal mining. On 8 December, Mahama defeated Bawumia, winning 56.55% of the vote. Bawumia gained 41.61% of the vote, coming second place. Bawumia conceded defeat.

In addition, the NPP lost its majority in the Ghanaian Parliament, falling to 88 seats. In a landslide victory, the NDC won 183 seats. The Commonwealth Observer Group&#x27;s leader former Botswanan President Mokgweetsi Masisi certified the election as largely free and fair, praising Vice-President Bawumia for exemplary statesmanship in his concession speech. While the Commonwealth Observation Group praised election authorities for facilitating access to the polling booths for disabled and elderly people, it expressed concerns about incidents of deadly violence and wheel chair-bound individuals experiencing long queues.

<text>Daarlerveen is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Hellendoorn, about 2 km south of the town of Vroomshoop.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned between 1851 and 1855 as Daarler Veen, and means &quot;peat excavation settlement belonging to Daarle&quot;. In 1850, the Overijssels Kanaal was dug, and excavation of the raised bog to east of Daarle started. During the excavation several archaeological finds were discovered including a wooden bridge and a canoe.

In 1906, a railway station opened in Daarlerveen on the Mariënberg to Almelo railway line. The Dutch Reformed church is wooden aisleless church built in 1937 with a modest tower. 

On 30 November 1944, the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; discovered ƒ46 million (~€300 million in 2021) in a hay stack in Daarlerveen. The money had been stolen during a bank robbery of the Dutch Resistance from a bank in Almelo on 15 November 1944, and was intended to finance strikes. At the time, it was the biggest bank robbery in the history of the Netherlands. Nine people were arrested. Only the barkeeper Frielink survived the war; the others died in Neuengamme concentration camp and Reiherhorst, part of Wöbbelin concentration camp.

<doc id="408435" wikidata="Q3014132" url="?curid=408435" title="Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut">
<text>Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut ( 1639 – 25 February 1710) was a French soldier and explorer who is the first European known to have visited the area where the city of Duluth, Minnesota, United States, is now located and the head of Lake Superior in Minnesota. His name is sometimes anglicized as &quot;DuLuth&quot;, and he is the namesake of Duluth, Minnesota, as well as Duluth, Georgia. Daniel Greysolon signed himself &quot;Dulhut&quot; on surviving manuscripts.

==Early life==
He was born about 1639 in Saint-Germain-Laval, near Saint-Étienne, France, and first visited New France in 1674.

==Exploration==
In September 1678, Dulhut left Montreal for Lake Superior, spending the winter near Sault Sainte Marie and reaching the western end of the lake in the fall of the following year, where he concluded peace talks between the Anishinaabe (Saulteur) and Dakota (Sioux) peoples. On 2 July 1679, DuLhut planted the flag of France &quot;in the great village of the Nadouecioux, called &quot;Izatys&quot;&quot;, a Dakota Mdewakanton town on what is now called Mille Lacs Lake. In June 1680, Duluth heard of the capture of a Catholic priest by the name of &quot;Louis Henpin&quot; (Louis Hennepin) who had been captured by other &quot;Nadouecioux&quot; (Sioux), among whom Duluth was living. After receiving word of his capture, Duluth set out at once to find the Franciscan priest and demand his release. Duluth bartered for the priest&#x27;s freedom, but in so doing he broke laws banning trading with Natives without government approval, which ultimately led to troubles back in Montreal. Lured by native stories of the Western or Vermilion Sea (likely the Great Salt Lake in Utah), Duluth reached the Mississippi River via the Saint Croix River in 1680 and then headed back to Fort de Buade, where he heard that jealous Quebec merchants and the intendant Jacques Duchesneau de la Doussinière et d&#x27;Ambault were slandering him. He was forced to return to Montreal and then France in 1681 to defend himself against false accusations of treason, returning the following year.

Duluth subsequently established fur trading posts to further French interests at Lake Nipigon and Fort Caministigoyan at the mouth of the Kaministiquia River on Lake Superior, the site of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario, probably 1684/85, not 1679 as many sources suggest, and at Fort St. Joseph (Port Huron) between Lake Erie and Lake Huron, which was garrisoned with 50 men.

==Death==
He died of gout in Montreal on 25 February 1710, and was buried in the Recollet church.

==Legacy==
Montreal has a Duluth Avenue (&quot;Avenue Duluth&quot; in French), named after Greysolon, located in &quot;The Plateau&quot; borough of the city (known as &quot;Le Plateau-Mont Royal&quot; in French). The avenue became quite popular with both residents and tourists after it was redesigned in the early 1980s. It was made to be more pedestrian-friendly with pleasantly-designed sidewalks, many trees, and flower boxes. It is said to have been modeled after Woonerf streets in the Netherlands and Belgium where pedestrians and cyclists have priority over motorized vehicles, which have a reduced speed limit.

Duluth, Minnesota, also has a road named after duLhut, Greysolon Road, stretching from the Endion to Congdon neighborhoods.

==In popular culture==
Colder by the Lake, a theater company in Duluth, Minnesota, produced an original comic opera based on the life of Daniel Greysolon, entitled &quot;Les Uncomfortables&quot; (a play on the title of the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;), the music was composed by Tyler Kaiser and the libretto written by Margi Preus and Jean Sramek, all of Duluth. The work was performed in 2001, 2002, and 2016.

<doc id="408439" wikidata="Q294365" url="?curid=408439" title="Talal of Jordan">
<text>Talal bin Abdullah (; 26 February 1909 – 7 July 1972) was King of Jordan from the assassination of his father, King Abdullah I, on 20 July 1951 until his forced abdication on 11 August 1952. As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, Talal was a 39th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad.

Talal was born in Mecca as the eldest son of Abdullah bin Hussein and his wife Musbah bint Nasser. Abdullah was a son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, who led the Great Arab Revolt during World War I against the Ottoman Empire in 1916. After removing Ottoman rule, Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921, and ruled as its Emir. During Abdullah&#x27;s absence, Talal spent his early years alone with his mother. Talal received private education in Amman, later joining Transjordan&#x27;s Arab Legion as second lieutenant in 1927. He then became aide to his grandfather Sharif Hussein, the ousted king of the Hejaz, during his exile in Cyprus. By 1948, Talal became a general in the Arab Legion.

The country sought independence in 1946, and the Emirate became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Talal became crown prince upon his father&#x27;s designation as king of Jordan. Abdullah was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951, and Talal became king. Talal&#x27;s most revered achievement as king is the establishment of Jordan&#x27;s modern constitution in 1952, rendering his kingdom a constitutional monarchy. He ruled for less than thirteen months until he was forced to abdicate by Parliament because he was experiencing mental illness, reported as schizophrenia. Talal spent the rest of his life at a sanatorium in Istanbul and died there on 7 July 1972. He was succeeded by his eldest son Hussein.

==Early life==
Talal was born in Mecca as the eldest child of Abdullah, an Arab deputy of Mecca in the Ottoman Parliament, and his wife Musbah bint Nasser. Abdullah was the son of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, traditional steward of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Sharif Hussein and his sons led the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916; after removing Ottoman rule, the Sharif&#x27;s sons established Arab monarchies in place. Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921, a British Protectorate, for which he was Emir. During Abdullah&#x27;s absence, Talal spent his early years alone with his mother. Talal received private education in Amman, later joining Transjordan&#x27;s Arab Legion as second lieutenant in 1927. He then became aide to his grandfather Sharif Hussein, the ousted King of the Hejaz, during his exile in Cyprus. By 1948, Talal became a general in the Army.

He was educated privately before attending the British Army&#x27;s Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he graduated in 1929 when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Cavalry Regiment of the Arab Legion. His regiment was attached to a British regiment in Jerusalem and also to the Royal Artillery in Baghdad. He married Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil in November of 1934, who bore his first son Hussein in 1935.

==Reign==
Talal ascended the Jordanian throne after the assassination of his father, Abdullah I, in Jerusalem. Abdullah I was killed by a Palestinian amid rumours that he had been planning to sign a peace treaty with the newly established state of Israel. Talal&#x27;s son Hussein, who was accompanying his grandfather at Friday prayers, was also nearly a victim. On 20 July 1951, Prince Hussein travelled to Jerusalem to perform Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque with his grandfather, King Abdullah I. An assassin, fearing that the king might normalise relations with the State of Israel, killed Abdullah, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived.

During his short reign he was responsible for the formation of a liberalised constitution for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which made the government collectively, and the ministers individually, responsible before the Jordanian Parliament. The constitution was ratified on 1 January 1952. King Talal is also judged as having done much to smooth the previously strained relations between Jordan and the neighbouring Arab states of Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Talal has been described by his cousin Prince Ra&#x27;ad bin Zeid in a 2002 interview as having &quot;very anti-British sentiments&quot;, caused by Britain&#x27;s failure to fully comply with their agreement with his grandfather Sharif Hussein ibn Ali in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence to establish an independent Arab kingdom under his rule. Talal was described by British resident in Transjordan Sir Alec Kirkbride in a 1939 correspondence as being &quot;at heart, deeply anti-British&quot;. However, Kirkbride doubted the meaningfulness of this animosity towards the British, owing it purely to the &quot;tension&quot; between Talal and his father Emir Abdullah and Talal&#x27;s desire to create of himself as a &quot;big nuisance as possible&quot;.

Israeli historian Avi Shlaim, however, argues that Talal&#x27;s contempt for the British was genuine as he &quot;bitterly resented British interference in the affairs of his country&quot; and that such hostility towards the British was downplayed by Kirkbride due to Britain&#x27;s &quot;self-serving&quot; interests to &quot;protect her reputation&quot;. Furthermore, at the time of the succession crisis that occurred after King Abdullah I&#x27;s assassination, Talal was described by contemporary Egyptian and Syrian press as a &quot;great patriotic anti-imperialist&quot; in contrast to his half-brother Naif, who also sought the throne, and was denounced as &quot;weak-minded and entirely subservient to British influence&quot;.

==Forced abdication and death==
A year into Talal&#x27;s reign, Arab Legion intelligence officer Major Hutson reported that Amman was &quot;seething with a rumor to the effect that the Legion, or Cabinet, intend on handing over West Jordan to Israel and that King Talal was deported by the British for refusing to agree&quot;.

At this time, Talal was reported by British resident Furlonge, Queen Zein (mother of Talal&#x27;s son and successor Hussein), and Prime Minister Tawfik Abu Al-Huda as experiencing a mental illness. Furlonge particularly suggested that Talal be &quot;forced out of Amman&quot; and &quot;forced into a French clinic&quot;. Talal was subsequently flown in a civil (not royal) RAF plane to Paris for &quot;treatment&quot;.

Talal&#x27;s reportedly unwell medical condition is highlighted by an incident on 29 May 1952 when Queen Zein (described by British historian Nigel J. Ashton as &quot;a sophisticated political operator with her own private communication channels with the British&quot;) sought refuge in the British embassy in Paris, claiming that Talal &quot;threatened her with a knife and attempted to kill one of his younger children&quot;. Prime Minister Tawfik Abu al-Huda consequently attempted to induce Talal into abdicating; however, he was harshly reproached by Talal, who said he &quot;had no intentions of abdicating&quot;. Furthermore, PM Abu al-Huda received reports that Talal was attempting to challenge the government with the help of &quot;private individuals&quot; and an &quot;officer in the Arab Legion&quot;.

This led Abu al-Huda into summoning both houses of parliament to an &quot;extraordinary session&quot;, requesting their approval of a motion dictating that Talal be deposed for &quot;medical reasons&quot;, specifically &quot;schizophrenia&quot;. Abu al-Huda backed up his requests with medical reports and argued that Talal&#x27;s medical condition was irrevocable, and Talal&#x27;s deposition was unanimously accepted by parliament later that day.

Nationalist officers in the Army suspected that the parliamentary session to discuss Talal&#x27;s abdication was a plot against him. They asked the King&#x27;s aide-de-camp, &#x27;Abd Al&#x27;Aziz Asfur, to arrange a meeting with him to arrange a response to the supposed plot. However, Asfur returned to the officers and confirmed the claims about his mental condition.

Abu al-Huda proceeded to rule Jordan, from the day of Talal&#x27;s deposition on 11 August 1952 until Talal&#x27;s son Hussein came of age on 2 May 1953, in a &quot;dictatorial&quot; fashion. He was described by Glubb Pasha as a &quot;Prime Minister dictator&quot; who had ruled &quot;stably&quot; as Emir Abdullah I had done. Glubb Pasha particularly commended this as he noted that Arab countries were presently &quot;unfit for full democracy on the British model&quot;. Abu al-Huda&#x27;s ascension was supported by Political Resident Furlonge as Abu al-Huda was from the &quot;old guard&quot; and thus &quot;accustomed to the existing system and relationship with Britain&quot;.

Contrary to his wish to live in Saudi-ruled Hejaz after his abdication, Talal was sent to live the latter part of his life at a sanatorium in Istanbul and died there on 7 July 1972. Talal was buried in the Royal Mausoleum at the Raghadan Palace in Amman.

==Legacy==
Despite his short reign, he is revered for having established a modern constitution of Jordan.

==Personal life==
In 1934, Talal married his first cousin Zein al-Sharaf who bore him four sons and two daughters:
*King Hussein (14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999).
*Princess Asma, died at birth in 1937.
*Prince Muhammad (2 October 1940 – 29 April 2021).

<doc id="408442" wikidata="Q686052" url="?curid=408442" title="Rick Pitino">
<text>Richard Andrew Pitino (; born September 18, 1952) is an American basketball coach who is the head men&#x27;s basketball coach at St. John&#x27;s University. He was also the head coach of Greece&#x27;s senior national team. He has been the head coach of several teams in NCAA Division I and in the NBA, including Boston University (1978–1983), Providence College (1985–1987), the New York Knicks (1987–1989), the University of Kentucky (1989–1997), the Boston Celtics (1997–2001), the University of Louisville (2001–2017), Panathinaikos of the Greek Basket League and EuroLeague (2018–2020), and Iona University (2020–2023).

Pitino led Kentucky to an NCAA championship in 1996 and Louisville to a national championship in 2013. He was the first coach to lead three different schools (Providence, Kentucky, and Louisville) to the NCAA Final Four, and is the only coach to win a national championship at two different schools.

In 2013, while in Atlanta with his team for the Final Four, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

In June 2017, the NCAA suspended Pitino for five games of the 2017–18 season for a perceived lack of oversight in an escort sex scandal at the University of Louisville involving recruits. Louisville&#x27;s national championship from 2013 was eventually vacated and is being appealed by the university. In September, Pitino was implicated in a federal investigation involving bribes to recruits, which resulted in Louisville firing him for cause. He was later exonerated of these accusations and soon returned to coaching after a brief stint as a broadcaster.

On March 20, 2023, he was named head basketball coach at St. John&#x27;s University.

==Early years and education==
Pitino was born in New York City, and was raised in Bayville, New York. He was the team captain of the St. Dominic High School basketball team in Oyster Bay, Long Island.

Pitino enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1970. At a listed height of tall, he was a point guard for the Minutemen basketball team. Pitino held the tenth spot at UMass for career assists, with 329, until Chaz Williams (2011–2014) became the leader in career assists following his final season with the Minutemen. He led the team in assists as a junior and senior. The 168 assists as a senior is the eighth-best single season total ever there.

Pitino was a freshman at the same time future NBA legend Julius Erving spent his junior (and final) year at UMass, although the two never played on the same team because freshmen were ineligible to play varsity basketball at the time. Other teammates of Pitino&#x27;s include Al Skinner, who also went on to become a successful college coach, and baseball player Mike Flanagan, who went on to pitch in the major leagues and win the AL Cy Young Award in 1979. Pitino earned his degree from UMass in 1974.

==Career==
===University of Hawaii (1974–1976)===
Pitino started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at the University of Hawaii in 1974, and became a full-time assistant in 1975. Pitino served as Hawaii&#x27;s interim head coach late in the 1975–76 season. Coach Bruce O&#x27;Neil was fired after the Rainbow Warriors started the season 9–12. Pitino led Hawaii for their final six games, going 2–4 in the span.

====Scandal and investigation====
Pitino&#x27;s time at Hawaii was marred by a 1977 NCAA report on sanctions against the program. According to the report, Pitino was implicated in 8 of the 64 infractions that led the university to be placed on probation. The violations involving Pitino included providing round-trip air fare for a player between New York and Honolulu, arranging for student-athletes to receive used cars for season tickets, and handing out coupons to players for free food at McDonald&#x27;s. He was also cited, along with the head coach, Bruce O&#x27;Neil, for providing misinformation to the NCAA and University of Hawaii officials. Also in 1977, the NCAA infractions committee recommended that Pitino and O&#x27;Neil be disassociated from Hawaii athletics. In 1989, Pitino would dismiss the report, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes. I don&#x27;t care what anybody says.&quot;

===Syracuse (1976–1978)===
Pitino was the first assistant hired by Jim Boeheim in 1976 as Boeheim began his tenure at Syracuse University.

===Boston University (1978–1983)===
In 1978, Boston University athletic director John Simpson hired Pitino as head coach, funding the Terriers men&#x27;s basketball team with $20,000 for recruiting players and fifteen full scholarships, the maximum allowed under NCAA rules and far more than prior head coach Roy Sigler was allotted. As compensation, Pitino received a Renault Le Car and an annual salary of $17,500.

In the two seasons before Pitino&#x27;s arrival, the Terriers had won a mere 17 games. During his 5-year tenure, the team slogan was, “the hardest working coach, for the hardest working team in the country.&quot; Pitino used the full-court press for almost the entirety of each game, eventually leading the Terriers to their first NCAA tournament appearance in 24 years.

===New York Knicks (1983–1985)===
Pitino left Boston University to become an assistant coach with the New York Knicks under Hubie Brown.

===Providence (1985–1987)===
In 1985, Pitino returned to college coaching to become head coach at Providence College after being hired by then-athletic director Lou Lamoriello. Providence had gone a dismal 11–20 in the year before he took over. Two years later, Pitino led the team to the Final Four. That Final Four team featured point guard Billy Donovan, who would go on to be an assistant coach under Pitino at the University of Kentucky and then win back-to-back national championships as head coach at the University of Florida.

===New York Knicks (1987–1989)===
Pitino became head coach of the New York Knicks on July 14, 1987. The year before he arrived, the team had only won 24 games. In just two years, Pitino led the Knicks to their first division title in nearly twenty years. He resigned from the Knicks on May 30, 1989.

===Kentucky (1989–1997)===

After spending two years coaching in the NBA, Pitino returned to the college level again in 1989, becoming the coach at Kentucky. The Kentucky program was recovering from a major recruiting scandal brought on by former coach Eddie Sutton that left it on NCAA probation. Pitino quickly restored Kentucky&#x27;s reputation and performance, leading his second school to the Final Four in the 1993 NCAA tournament, and winning a national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky&#x27;s 6th NCAA Championship. The following year, Pitino&#x27;s Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino&#x27;s fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school&#x27;s fans, implementing his signature style of full-court pressure defense. The following year, he left Kentucky for the NBA and Kentucky went on to win the 1998 national title. He would later refer to Kentucky as &quot;the Roman Empire of college basketball&quot;.

===Boston Celtics (1997–2001)===
Pitino returned to the NBA in 1997 when the Boston Celtics hired him as head coach on May 6, 1997. He resigned on January 8, 2001. His NBA coaching experience often demonstrated a deep frustration with the dynamics of the league, especially in Boston, where he amassed a 102–146 record from 1997 to 2001. After being beaten by the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino&#x27;s frustration reached critical mass as he addressed the press. Referring to the expectations of Boston Celtics fans and media, Pitino challenged each of them to let go of the past and focus on the future:
Pitino struggled in Boston, and statistics like 1998–99&#x27;s 19–31 record made him little better in the eyes of many Boston fans than his inexperienced predecessor, M. L. Carr. Pitino&#x27;s remarks became a cornerstone of Celtics lore, and has served as a metaphor for other sports franchises and their inability to relive past successes. Pitino himself reprised the speech in a tongue-in-cheek manner at Louisville in November 2005, challenging his freshmen players to play as tough as past seniors and drawing laughter from sportswriters in a postgame press conference. During his time in Boston, he also served as team president, with complete control over basketball operations.

===Louisville (2001–2017)===

Pitino returned to college—and his adopted home state—on March 21, 2001, to coach the University of Louisville following the retirement of Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum. In the 2005 season, Pitino led Louisville to their first Final Four in 19 years, and became the first men&#x27;s coach in NCAA history to lead three different schools to the Final Four. Immediately following their Final Four run, several players graduated or entered the 2005 NBA draft. The inexperience caused the Cardinals to limp into the Big East tournament seeded 12th, and miss the NCAA tournament. They made the semifinals of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), where they were defeated by eventual champions University of South Carolina. The 2007 Cardinal team was primarily the same team, with added freshmen. Picked to finish towards the bottom of the Big East Conference again, Pitino led them to a second-place finish, 12–4 (tied with the University of Pittsburgh, who had been beaten by the Cardinals during the regular season) in the conference standings and a first round bye in the conference tournament. Pitino implemented a 2–2–1 and 2–3 zone defense midway through the season. The 2007 team&#x27;s season ended when the Cardinals lost to Texas A&amp;M in the second round of the NCAA tournament. The 2008 Cardinals finished second in the Big East and ranked 13th in both the AP and Coaches&#x27; polls. Louisville was the third seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament&#x27;s East region. They defeated Boise State, Oklahoma and Tennessee to advance to the Elite Eight, where they were defeated by North Carolina. Louisville was the top seed overall in the 2009 NCAA tournament and was planted as the first seed in the Midwest region. They defeated Morehead State, Siena and Arizona to advance to the Elite Eight, where they were defeated by Michigan State. In 2010 the Cardinals suffered a disappointing 15-point loss to their first round opponent, the California Golden Bears. In 2011, Louisville was upset by 13th-seeded Morehead State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

In 2012, Pitino coached the Cardinals to the Big East tournament championship and a berth as No. 4 seed in the West region of the NCAA tournament. The Cardinals defeated Davidson, New Mexico, and top seed Michigan State to advance to the regional final against Florida and his former player and friend Billy Donovan. The Cardinals would go on to win that game, but lost to arch-rivals and eventual national champions Kentucky in the 2012 Final Four.

In 2013, Pitino led the Louisville Cardinals to their third national championship in an 82–76 win over Michigan to become the first NCAA Division I coach in history to win a championship with two different schools.

The University of Louisville self-imposed a postseason ban for the 2015–16 season amid an ongoing NCAA investigation over an escort sex scandal involving recruits between 2010 and 2014. The ban included both the ACC tournament and the NCAA tournament. On June 15, 2017, the NCAA charged Pitino for failure to monitor his basketball program, which was involved in a sex-for-pay scandal. He was suspended for the first five games of the ACC season in 2017–18. On February 20, 2018, the NCAA officially announced that the 2013 National Championship and their 2012 Final Four appearance had been vacated. It was the first time the NCAA vacated a men&#x27;s basketball national title.

====Scandal and ouster====

On September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors announced that the school was under investigation for an alleged &quot;pay for play&quot; involving recruits at Louisville. The allegations state that an Adidas executive conspired to pay $100,000 to the family of a top-ranked national recruit to play at Louisville and to represent Adidas when he turned pro. The criminal complaint did not name Louisville specifically but appeared to involve the recruitment of Brian Bowen, who committed on June 3, 2017, to the school.

A day later, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid administrative leave, while athletic director Tom Jurich was placed on paid administrative leave. According to a letter interim president Greg Postel sent to Pitino, the information spelled out by prosecutors amounted to a &quot;material breach&quot; of his contract. Pitino&#x27;s lawyer, Steve Pence, told &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; that as he understood it, Pitino had been &quot;effectively fired&quot;. Under the terms of Pitino&#x27;s contract, Louisville was required to give him 10 days&#x27; notice and &quot;an opportunity to be heard&quot; before firing him for cause. According to CBS Sports&#x27; Gary Parrish, school officials did not intend for Pitino to ever return to the sidelines again, and planned to cut ties with him as soon as they could legally do so.

On October 2, the board of the University of Louisville Athletic Association voted to formally begin the process of firing Pitino for cause. On the same day, Pitino, through his lawyer, claimed that Louisville officials should have given him 10 days notice and a chance to respond before placing him on leave. On October 16, the ULAA board voted unanimously to fire Pitino for cause.

On September 18, 2019, nearly two years after his dismissal and his lawsuit for $38.7 million against the ULAA, Pitino settled with the university and dropped the case. As a result, his termination was changed from a firing on October 16, 2017, to a resignation on October 3, 2017, citing &quot;zero liability&quot; between both parties.

===Panathinaikos (2018–2020)===
On December 26, 2018, Panathinaikos announced Pitino as the head coach of the team until the end of the season, marking his debut in the EuroLeague. On February 17, 2019, they won the 2018–19 Greek Cup against PAOK in the final. In the EuroLeague Regular Season, they managed to make a comeback after a 6–8 start, to finish in sixth place and reach the playoffs, after they registered ten wins in their last 16 games. In the EuroLeague Playoffs, Panathinaikos fell for a second consecutive year against defending champions Real Madrid, thus failing to qualify for the 2019 EuroLeague Final Four. The season ended with Panathinaikos winning the 2018–19 Greek Basket League&#x27;s season championship, after they swept Promitheas Patras 3–0 in the League&#x27;s Finals. After the season, Panathinaikos made an offer to coach Pitino to extend his stay, and although he showed willingness to stay in Greece for another season, he declined the offer, due to a family matter.

On November 26, 2019, Pitino was rehired by Panathinaikos as the team&#x27;s head coach on a two-year deal after the firing of Argyris Pedoulakis. He remained with the team until March 2020 when the 2019–20 EuroLeague season
was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving Panathinaikos at sixth place.

===Iona (2020–2023)===
On March 14, 2020, Pitino was named head coach of Iona College after Tim Cluess stepped down from the position due to health issues on March 13. Despite the hiring, Pitino was scheduled to finish his commitments to Panathinaikos, however on March 20, Panathinaikos announced mutual agreement to terminate the contract.

The 2020-21 team was 6–3 in conference play for 9th in MAAC play but ran the table in the MAAC tournament with four upsets to reach the NCAA tournament and make Pitino the third coach ever to lead five different programs to the NCAA tournament. Pitino&#x27;s squad won the regular season title in the next two seasons and won the MAAC tournament in Pitino&#x27;s final season.

===St. John&#x27;s (2023–present)===
On March 20, 2023, Pitino was named the head coach of St. John&#x27;s, just a week after Mike Anderson was fired after four years.

==National team career==

===Puerto Rico===
On December 20, 2010, Pitino was hired as head coach of the senior Puerto Rico national team. On April 29, 2011, it was announced that Pitino would not coach the Puerto Rico national team, due to scheduling conflicts and NCAA regulations disallowing it. Pitino coached the Puerto Rican national team at the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship, in Mexico City, Mexico. They finished the tournament in 5th place.

===Greece===
On November 8, 2019, Pitino was hired as head coach of Greece&#x27;s senior national team. The Hellenic Basketball Federation announced that Pitino would be Greece&#x27;s head coach at the 2020 FIBA Victoria Olympic qualifying tournament and the 2020 Summer Olympics, should Greece qualify, while Thanasis Skourtopoulos would serve as Greece&#x27;s head coach for the 2021 EuroBasket qualification tournament.

==Personal life==
Pitino married the former Joanne Minardi in 1976. They have five living children, one of whom, Richard, is currently the head coach of the New Mexico Lobos. Another son, Daniel, died from congenital heart failure in 1987 at the age of six months. Rick and Joanne established the Daniel Pitino Foundation (along with a Daniel Pitino shelter in Owensboro, Kentucky) in his memory, which has raised millions of dollars for children in need.

Their son&#x27;s death was not the last tragedy for Rick and Joanne. Both were especially hard-hit by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as Joanne&#x27;s brother and Rick&#x27;s closest friend, Billy Minardi, was working as a bond trader for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center when it was struck by American Airlines Flight 11. Since 2002, the University of Louisville has designated a December home game as the Billy Minardi Classic, and the university named a dorm on campus as &quot;Billy Minardi Hall&quot;. Only a few months earlier, another brother-in-law of Rick, Don Vogt, was killed after being hit by a New York City cab.

===Author and accomplishments===
Pitino is the author of a motivational self-help book (and audio recording) named &quot;Success is a Choice&quot;. He published an autobiography in 1988 entitled &quot;Born to Coach&quot;, describing his life up until his time with the Knicks. His book &quot;Rebound Rules&quot;, was the top seller at the 2008 Kentucky Book Fair. His most recent book, &quot;Pitino: My Story,&quot; was published in 2018. A detailed biography, it also delivers his version of events regarding the Adidas sneaker scandal and his subsequent ouster as the University of Louisville men&#x27;s basketball coach.

In 2005, Pitino&#x27;s Louisville team posted a tie for the most single-season wins in school history (33)—since surpassed by the 35 total wins by the 2013 NCAA title-winning Cardinals team—while he is one of two men&#x27;s coaches in NCAA history to lead three separate schools (Providence, Kentucky, and Louisville) to the Final Four. The other coach is his in-state rival, John Calipari (UMass Amherst, Memphis, Kentucky), though both final four appearances at UMass and Memphis were later vacated (as was Louisville&#x27;s 2013 title under Pitino).

As of 2022, Pitino&#x27;s .730 winning percentage in 74 NCAA Tournament games ranked seventh among all coaches.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
Beyond basketball, Pitino has been involved in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing as the lead partner in Celtic Pride Stable and the Ol Memorial Stable. Among his notable horses have been A P Valentine and Halory Hunter. Pitino, through the stable name of RAP Racing, owns a 5 percent share of Goldencents. Goldencents, who won the $750,000 2013 Santa Anita Derby, ran in the 2013 Kentucky Derby and finished 17th despite having 8/1 odds of winning.

===Extortion attempt against Pitino===
On April 18, 2009, Pitino announced that he was the target of an extortion attempt. On April 24, Karen Cunagin Sypher, the wife of Louisville equipment manager Tim Sypher, was arraigned and charged in US District Court with extortion and lying to federal agents. The federal government alleged that Cunagin demanded vehicles and tuition money for her children from Pitino and later demanded $10 million from him. According to the federal complaint, the demands arose from an unspecified encounter between Sypher and Pitino.

On August 11, Pitino admitted that he had sexual relations with Cunagin on August 1, 2003, at Porcini, a Louisville restaurant. Several weeks later, Cunagin told Pitino that she was pregnant and wanted to have an abortion, but added she did not have health insurance. Pitino paid her $3,000 for the abortion. During the trial, Pitino downplayed the pair&#x27;s sexual escapade, testifying that the entire act did not take more than 15 seconds. Cunagin claimed that her estranged husband, Tim Sypher, was paid to marry her.

At a press conference on August 12, Pitino apologized for his indiscretion and stated that he would remain as coach. While Pitino&#x27;s contract allowed for his firing for &quot;acts of moral depravity or misconduct that damages the university&#x27;s reputation,&quot; University of Louisville president James Ramsey announced on August 13 that Pitino would remain in his position.

On August 6, 2010, a federal district court found Cunagin guilty of extortion and lying to federal agents. She was eventually sentenced to 87 months in prison. Cunagin was released to a halfway house in January 2017. After her conviction, Cunagin hired new attorneys and accused the judge, prosecutors, her former attorneys, and Pitino of taking part in a conspiracy to ensure that she was found guilty. She later expressed &quot;exceptional remorse and contrition regarding her commission of her offenses&quot;.

== Legacy ==
As a collegiate head coach, Pitino has compiled a 684–282 record, for a .708 winning percentage that is ranked 11th among active coaches and 34th all-time among all collegiate basketball coaches following the 2021–22 season.

Pitino is considered by many to be one of the first coaches to promote fully taking advantage of the 3-point shot, first adopted by the NCAA in 1987. By exploiting the 3-point shot, his teams at Kentucky in the early 1990s were known as Pitino&#x27;s Bombinos, as a significant portion of the offensive points came from the 3-point shot. Even now, Pitino&#x27;s teams are known for the 3-point threat and all of his teams rank towards the top in 3-point attempts per season. Additionally, his teams are known for their signature use of the full-court press and 2–3 zone defensive schemes, as well as their general aggressive defensive style.

Many of Pitino&#x27;s players and assistant coaches have gone on to become successful collegiate coaches. In total, 21 former Pitino players and coaches have become Division I head coaches, including former University of Florida coach Billy Donovan (now head coach of the Chicago Bulls), former High Point University coach Tubby Smith, Santa Clara University&#x27;s Herb Sendek, UCLA&#x27;s Mick Cronin, New Mexico&#x27;s Richard Pitino (his son), Maryland&#x27;s Kevin Willard, former Cal State Northridge coach Reggie Theus and University of Kentucky&#x27;s Mark Pope.

 ^abcdefghijkl Louisville has vacated all of its victories and three losses from the 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15 seasons. These 123 wins and three losses are not included in Pitino&#x27;s all-time record.

<doc id="408443" wikidata="Q285480" url="?curid=408443" title="Baileys Irish Cream">
<text>Baileys Irish Cream is an Irish cream liqueur made of cream, cocoa and Irish Whiskey emulsified together with vegetable oil. Baileys is made by Diageo at Nangor Road, in Dublin, Ireland and in Mallusk, Northern Ireland. It is the original Irish cream, invented by a team headed by Tom Jago in 1971 for Gilbeys of Ireland; Diageo currently owns the trademark. It has a declared alcohol content of 17% by volume.

==History and origin==
Baileys Irish Cream was created in London by advertising executive Tom Jago, working from a marketing brief issued by Gilbeys of Ireland, a division of International Distillers &amp; Vintners. Gilbeys was searching for something to introduce to the international market. The process of finding a product began in 1971, and production research began in earnest after consultants David Gluckman, Hugh Seymour-Davies and Mac Macpherson came up with an alcoholic drink made of Irish whiskey and cream that, they remarked, &quot;didn&#x27;t taste punishing&quot;. David Gluckman also came up with the idea of naming it &quot;Baileys&quot;.

The formulation of Baileys was motivated partly by the availability of alcohol from a money-losing distillery (part of International Distillers &amp; Vintners, and probably W&amp;A Gilbey) and a desire to use surplus cream from another business, Express Dairies, owned by Grand Metropolitan, resulting from the increased popularity of semi-skimmed milk. It included alcohol, cream and the chocolate milk-based drink powder Nesquik produced by Nestle; the initial formulation process took approximately 45 minutes.

Baileys was introduced in 1974 as the first Irish cream on the market. The name is that of a restaurant owned by John Chesterman, who granted W&amp;A Gilbey permission to use it. The fictional &quot;R.A. Bailey&quot; signature was inspired by The Bailey&#x27;s Hotel in London, though the registered trademark omits the apostrophe.

==Manufacture==
Cream and Irish whiskey from various distilleries are homogenised to form an emulsion with the aid of an emulsifier containing refined vegetable oil. The process prevents the separation of alcohol and cream during storage. Baileys contains a proprietary cocoa extract recipe giving Baileys its chocolate character and essence. The number of other ingredients is not known, but they include herbs, sugar, vanilla and caramel.

According to the manufacturer, no preservatives are required as the alcohol content preserves the cream. The cream used in the drink comes from Tirlán, an Irish dairy company. Tirlán&#x27;s Virginia facility in County Cavan produces a range of fat-filled milk powders and fresh cream. It has been the principal cream supplier to Baileys Irish Cream Liqueurs for more than 30 years. At busier times of the year, Tirlán also supplies cream from its Ballyragget facility in Kilkenny.
Baileys bottles are manufactured solely at Encirc Glass Plant in Derrylin, County Fermanagh.

==Shelf life==
The manufacturer claims Baileys Irish Cream has a shelf life of 24 months and guarantees its taste for two years from the day it was made—opened or unopened, refrigerated or not—when stored away from direct sunlight at temperatures between .
==Nutritional values==


==Drinking==
As with milk, cream will curdle whenever it comes into contact with a weak acid. Milk and cream contain casein, which coagulates when mixed with weak acids such as lemon, tonic water, or traces of wine. While this outcome is undesirable in most situations, some cocktails (such as the cement mixer, which consists of a shot of Baileys mixed with the squeezed juice from a slice of lime) specifically encourage coagulation.

==Variant flavours==
In 2003, Bailey &amp; Co. launched Baileys Glide, aimed at the alcopop market. It was discontinued in 2006.

In 2005, Baileys launched mint chocolate and crème caramel variants at 17% ABV. They were originally released in UK airports and were subsequently released in the mass markets of the UK, US, Australia and Canada in 2006.

In 2008, Baileys, after the success of previous flavour variants, released a coffee variant, followed by a hazelnut-flavoured variant in 2010. The company trialled a new premium variety, Baileys Gold, at several European airports in 2009. The Gold version also was marketed towards the Japanese consumer. 2011, Baileys launched a Biscotti flavour, and a sub-brand premium product Baileys Chocolat Luxe, which combined Belgian chocolate with Baileys, in 2013. The company released a Vanilla-Cinnamon variety in the US market in 2013, with further flavours, Pumpkin Spice, Espresso and Salted Caramel launching the following year.

From 2016 to 2018, Baileys Coffee Mocha and Latte was available in cans across the UK and Europe. In 2017, Baileys launched their Pumpkin Spice flavoured liqueur, as well as their vegan-friendly Baileys Almande, described as a blend of &quot;sweet almond oil, cane sugar and a touch of real vanilla&quot;.

Baileys have continued to release new varieties, including Strawberries &amp; Cream (2018), Red Velvet Cupcake (2019), Apple Pie (2020), Pina Colada (2021 &amp; 2023) S&#x27;more (2022) and Vanilla Mint Shake (2023).

<doc id="408449" wikidata="Q17080806" url="?curid=408449" title="Circle dance">
<text>Circle dance, or chain dance, is a style of social dance done in a circle, semicircle or a curved line to musical accompaniment, such as rhythm instruments and singing, and is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of partners. Unlike line dancing, circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the connection is made by hand-to-hand, finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders, where they follow the leader around the dance floor. Ranging from gentle to energetic, the dance can be an uplifting group experience or part of a meditation.

Being probably the oldest known dance formation, circle dancing is an ancient tradition common to many cultures for marking special occasions, rituals, strengthening community and encouraging togetherness. Circle dances are choreographed to many different styles of music and rhythms. Modern circle dance mixes traditional folk dances, mainly from European or Near Eastern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern. There is a growing repertoire of new circle dances to classical music and contemporary songs.

==Distribution==

Modern circle dancing is found in many cultures, including Arabic (Levantian and Iraqi), Israeli (see Jewish dance and Israeli folk dancing), Luri, Assyrian, Kurdish, Turkish, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Maltese, Ukraine and Balkan. It also found in South Asia such as Nati of Himachal Pradesh, Harul of Uttarakhand, Wanvun of Kashmir, Jhumair of Jharkhand, Fugdi of Goa and Deuda and Dhan Nach of Nepal. Despite its immense reputation in the Middle East and southeast Europe, circle dancing also has a historical prominence in Brittany, Asturias, Catalonia, and Ireland to the west of Europe, and also in South America (Peruvian), Tibet, and with Native Americans (see ghost dance). It is also used, in its more meditative form, in worship within various religious traditions including the Church of England and the Islamic Haḍra Dhikr (or Zikr) dances.

==History==
===South Asia===
Cave painting found in south Asia since Paleolithic period. Cave paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters of Madhya Pradesh in India shows the painting of dancers and musician which is from Mesolithic period. It shows people dancing by holding hand together.

===Balkans===


Medieval tombstones called &quot;Stećci&quot; (singular &quot;Stecak&quot;) in Bosnia and Hercegovina, dating from the end of the 12th century to the 16th century, bear inscriptions and figures which look like dancers in a chain. Men and women are portrayed dancing together holding hands at shoulder level but occasionally the groups consist of only one sex.

In Macedonia, near the town of Zletovo, the murals on the monastery of Lesnovo (Lesnovo Manastir), which date from the 14th century, show a group of young men linking arms in a round dance. A chronicle from 1344 urges the people of the city of Zadar to sing and dance circle dances for a festival. However, a reference comes from Bulgaria, in a manuscript of a 14th-century sermon, which called chain dances &quot;devilish and damned.&quot;

===Central Europe===

The circle dance of Germany is called &quot;Reigen&quot;; it dates from the 10th century, and may have originated from devotional dances at early Christian festivals. Dancing around the church or a fire was frequently denounced by church authorities which only underscores how popular it was. One of the frescos (dating from the 14th century) in Tyrol, at Runkelstein Castle, depicts Elisabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary leading a chain dance. Circle dances were also found in Czech Republic, dating to the 15th century. Dancing was primarily done around trees on the village green. In Poland as well the earliest village dances were in circles or lines accompanied by the singing or clapping of the participants.

===Mediterranean===

In the 14th century, Giovanni Boccaccio describes men and women circle dancing to their own singing or accompanied by musicians. One of the frescos in Siena by Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted in 1338–1340 show a group of women doing a &quot;bridge&quot; figure while accompanied by another woman playing the tambourine.

There are accounts of two western European travelers to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. In 1577, Salomon Schweigger describes the events at a Greek wedding:

Another traveler, the German pharmacist Reinhold Lubenau, was in Constantinople in November 1588 and reports on a Greek wedding in these terms:

===Scandinavia===
In Denmark, old ballads mention a closed circle dance which can open into a chain dance. A fresco in Ørslev church in Zealand from about 1400 shows nine people, men and women, dancing in a line. The leader and some others in the chain carry bouquets of flowers. In the case of women&#x27;s dances, there may have been a man who acted as the leader. In Sweden, medieval songs often mentioned dancing. A long chain was formed, with the leader singing the verses and setting the time while the other dancers joined in the chorus.

==Modern dances==

===Eastern Europe===

====Hora====
The Hora dance originates in the Balkans but is also found in other countries (including Romania and Moldova). The dancers hold each other&#x27;s hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back. The Hora is popular during wedding celebrations and festivals, and is an essential part of social entertainment in rural areas. In Bulgaria, it is not necessary to be in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable.

====Kolo====

The Kolo is a collective folk dance common in various South Slavic regions, such as Serbia and Bosnia, named after the circle formed by the dancers. It is performed amongst groups of people (usually several dozen, at the very least three) holding each other&#x27;s having their hands around each other&#x27;s waists (ideally in a circle, hence the name). There is almost no movement above the waist.

===Southern Europe===
====Albanian circle dances====

Early descriptions of the Albanian war dance in circle around fire was provided in the early 19th century by western travellers who visited southern Albania. The dance is practiced for several hours with very short intervals, acquiring new vigour from the words of the accompanying song that starts with a battle cry invoking war drums, and which is of a piece with the movement and usually changed only once or twice during the whole performance.

The ritual purifying fire (Zjarri) is traditionally used by Albanians, in particular singing and dancing around it, to gain protection and energizing from its supernatural power.

A ritual practiced during Dita e Verës, an Albanian pagan feast that celebrates the spring equinox – the beginning of the spring-summer period with the strengthening of the Sun (Dielli) and the renewal of Nature – has been described as follows:

====Kalamatianos====
The Kalamatianos is a popular Greek folkdance throughout Greece and Cyprus, and is often performed at many social gatherings worldwide. As is the case with most Greek folk dances, it is danced in a circle with a counterclockwise rotation, the dancers holding hands. The lead dancer usually holds the second dancer by a handkerchief, thus allowing more elaborate steps and acrobatics. The steps of the Kalamatianós are the same as those of the Syrtos, but the latter is slower and more stately, its beat being a steady .

====Sardana====
Sardana is a type of circle dance typical of Catalonia. It would usually have an experienced dancer leading the circle. The dancers hold hands throughout the dance: arms down during the &quot;curts&quot; and raised to shoulder height during the &quot;llargs&quot;. The dance was originally from the Empordà region, but started gaining popularity throughout Catalonia during the 20th century. There are two main types, the original &quot;Sardana curta&quot; (short Sardana) style and the more modern &quot;Sardana llarga&quot; (long Sardana).

====Syrtos====

Syrtos and Kalamatianos are Greek dances done with the dancers in a curving line holding hands, facing right. The dancer at the right end of the line is the leader. The leader can also be a solo performer, improvising showy twisting skillful moves as the rest of the line does the basic step. In some parts of Syrtos, pairs of dancers hold a handkerchief from its two sides.

===Western Europe===
====An Dro====

An Dro, meaning &quot;the turn&quot;, is a Breton circle dance. The dancers link the little fingers in a long line, swinging their arms, whilst moving to their left. The arm movements consist first of two circular motions going up and back followed by one in the opposite direction. The leader (person at the left-hand end of the line) will lead the line into a spiral or double it back on itself to form patterns on the dance floor, and allow the dancers to see each other.

====Faroese chain dance====

The Faroese chain dance is the national circle dance of the Faroe Islands. The dance originated in medieval times, and survived only in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its pagan origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other&#x27;s hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs. When more and more dancers join the dance vine, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.

====Sacred Circle Dance====
The Sacred Circle Dance was brought to the Findhorn Foundation community in Scotland by Bernhard Wosien; he presented traditional circle dances that he had gathered from across Eastern Europe. Colin Harrison and David Roberts and Janet Rowan Scott took the dances to other parts of the United Kingdom where they started regular groups in south east England, then across Europe, the US and elsewhere. The network extends also to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South America, and India. A small centrepiece of flowers or other objects is often placed at the centre of the circle to help focus the dancers and maintain the circular shape. Much debate goes on within the sacred circle dance network about what is meant by &#x27;sacred&#x27; in the dance.

===Middle East===

====Dabke====

Dabke is popular in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan and Turkey. The most famous type of the dance is the &quot;Al-Shamaliyya&quot; (). It consists of a &quot;lawweeh&quot; () at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own. The lawweeh is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations.

====Govend====

Govend is one of the most famous traditional Kurdish dances. It is distinguished from other Middle Eastern dances by being for both men and women. 

====Khigga====

Khigga is the one of main styles of Assyrian folk dance in which multiple dancers hold each other&#x27;s hands and form a line or a circle. It is usually performed at weddings and joyous occasions. Khigga is the first beat that is played in welcoming the bride and groom to the reception hall. There are multiple foot patterns that dancers perform. The head of the khigga line usually dances with a handkerchief with beads and bells added to the sides so it jingles when shaken. A decorated cane is also used at many Assyrian weddings. Moreover, the term &quot;khigga&quot; is used to denote all the Assyrian circle dances.

====Kochari====

Kochari is an Armenian folk dance, danced today by Armenians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Pontic Greeks and Turks. Dancers form a closed circle, putting their hands on each other&#x27;s shoulders. More modern forms of Kochari have added a &quot;tremolo step,&quot; which involves shaking the whole body. In Azerbaijan, the dance consists of slow and rapid parts, and is of three variants. There is a consistent, strong double bounce. Pontic Greeks dance hand-to-shoulder and travel to the right.

====Tamzara====

Tamzara is an Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek folk dance native to Anatolia. There are many versions of Tamzara, with slightly different music and steps, coming from the various regions and old villages in Anatolia. Firstly they take three steps forwards, tap their left feet on the ground, and step forward to stand on the left foot; then they take three small steps back and repeat the actions a little faster. Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked little fingers.

<text>On the federal level, Russia elects a president as head of state and a parliament, one of the two chambers of the Federal Assembly. The president is elected for, at most, two consecutive six-year terms by the people (raised from four years from December 2008). The Federal Assembly (&quot;Federalnoe Sobranie&quot;) has two chambers. The State Duma (&quot;Gosudarstvennaja Duma&quot;) has 450 members, elected for five-year terms (also four years up to December 2008). The Federation Council (&quot;Sovet Federatsii&quot;) is not directly elected; each of the 89 federal subjects of Russia sends 2 delegates to the Federal Council, for a total of 208 (178 (delegates from regions) + 30 (Russian representatives), members.

Since 1990, there have been seven elections for the presidency and seven for parliament. In the seven presidential elections, only once, in 1996, has a second round been needed. There have been three presidents, with Boris Yeltsin elected in 1991 and 1996, Vladimir Putin in 2000, 2004, 2012, 2018 and 2024, Dmitry Medvedev in 2008. The Communist candidate (of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the Communist Party of the Russian Federation) has finished second in every case: Nikolai Ryzhkov in 1991, Gennady Zyuganov in 1996, 2000 and 2008 and 2011, Nikolay Kharitonov in 2004 and Pavel Grudinin in 2018. Only in 1996 has there been a third candidate who gained more than 10% of the votes in the first round, Alexander Lebed.

In the parliamentary elections, the Communist Party was the largest party in the 1995 and 1999 elections, with 35% and 24% of the votes respectively. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has ranged from 5 to 15% of the votes, and Yabloko won 10% of the votes in 1995 and around 5% in the other three elections. The only other parties that have achieved more than 10% of the votes have been Democratic Choice of Russia with 16% in 1993, Our Home – Russia with 12% in 1995, and, in 1999, Unity with 23%, Fatherland – All Russia with 13% and People&#x27;s Deputies Faction with 15%. United Russia, an alliance of Unity and Fatherland – All Russia, became the biggest party with 38% in 2003.

Elections in Russia have been criticized as unfair elections under Putin&#x27;s rule. Political opponents have charges dug up and are jailed and repressed, independent media is intimidated and suppressed, and the elections have been claimed as fraudulent. The Economist Democracy Index characterized Russia as authoritarian in 2022. Russia was ranked 22nd least electoral democratic country in Asia according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023 with a score of 0.209 out of 1.

==Federal elections==

===Presidential===

The President is elected in a two-round system every six years, with a limit of two consecutive terms. Prior to 2012, the term of office was four years. If no candidate wins by an absolute majority in the first round, a second election round is held between two candidates with the most votes. The last presidential election was in 2024 and the next is expected in 2030.

Presidency in the Russian Federation is subject to the articles 80-93 of the Russian Constitution, the information provided in these articles is explanatory to the system of elections in Russia, and the main points to be highlighted are the following:

*The president is elected on basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage through secret ballots.
*The president is to be elected for a term of six years
*Any citizen of the Russian Federation with 35 or more years of age and that has had a permanent residence for at least 25 years in Russia can run for the presidency in Russia.
*The same person may not be elected President of the Russian Federation for more than two terms running.
* Not have foreign citizenship or residence permit in a foreign country, neither at the time of the election nor at any time before.

===Parliament===

Legislative elections take place in Russia&#x27;s 89 subjects of federation ranging from oblasts, republics, autonomous territories, and autonomous okrugs.

The elections for the State Duma of Russia are held every five years, and the dispute is for the 450 seats of the Parliament. Half of the seats are allocated through a proportional representation party list voting, with a threshold of 5%. The other half is appointed through majority voting, where one deputy is elected for one constituency. Regional assemblies with their respective deputies are formed through this system. The legislative body of Russia (the Federation Council and the State Duma) are subject to the articles 94-109 of the constitution, and these explain important points about the elections for the parliament in Russia, these are:

*The State Duma (lower house) is elected for a term of 5 years.
*Any citizen of the Russian Federation who is at least 21 years old can be a candidate.
*The president is to call the elections for the State Duma, in accordance with the Constitution.
*The Council of the Federation includes two representatives from each subject of the Russian Federation: one from the legislative and one from the executive body of state authority.

In May 2012 President Medvedev signed a new legislation exempting political parties from the need to collect signatures to run in parliamentary elections.

==Regional elections==

Gubernatorial elections are held yearly and are to be called upon by the president. These happen in September, by default, on the second Sunday of the month, but the timing is not always exact. Campaigning starts 28 days prior to the election.

===Governors===

===Regional parliaments===

==Local self-government elections==

The two main systems of local government include Mayor–council government in which voters cast their ballot for the mayor who represents the executive branch, and another ballot for the city council. The other system is Council–manager government with a city manager, who is nominated by and accountable to the City Duma.

===Local mayoral elections===

Elections for mayors in Russia are held in a small number of cities. In 2018, 12% of all cities and municipalities elected their mayors, as opposed to 65% in 2006; i.e. in the span of 12 years mayoral elections were halved. Out of the subjects&#x27; capitals, only 9 of 83 and (as of 2023) six &#x27;major cities&#x27; have direct mayoral elections. In those cities, elections for mayors are direct and based on universal suffrage. The executions of mayoral elections are dependent upon higher administrative authorities, and, for instance, can be cancelled by governors.

===Local legislative elections===
==Evolution of Russia&#x27;s electoral law==

1993 (Constitution of 1993) – Article 97: Elections in Russia are direct, subject to universal suffrage, and free and fair

1995 – Amendment Article 97: Parties are now required to gather at least 200000 signatures and to sign for candidature no later than 6 months before the elections.

1998 – Constitutional Court Judgement 26-P: 5% threshold is upheld by the Russian constitutional court

2002 – Law number 175: Mixed election of the state Duma is implemented with 50% of seats elected by a majority system for single-seat district votes (one deputy-one seat), and the other 50% through a proportional representation party list voting scheme.

2003 – Mixed system is abolished for a fully proportional representation system, with a 7% threshold.

2013 – Putin requires a return to the old mixed system, making elections for parliament being subject to Law number 175 once again.

==Criticism==

=== Presidential influence ===
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, three successive administrations (Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitry Medvedev) have played a significant role in forming a Russia&#x27;s party system that has been characterized by the domination of a ruling party which is financed and staffed by choice of the current presidential administration, and which in return provides support to it to serve its interests.

One study from Reuter et al. referred to criticism of mayoral and local self-government election in Russia. Findings being indicated that mayor candidates opposing the present ruling party, United Russia, had their elections cancelled more easily than those that could promote support for the ruling party.

Another study from Enikolopov et al. performed an investigation where observers were strategically placed at polling stations to see the effect of their presence on United Russia&#x27;s vote shares. Findings reveal that with observers, United Russia experienced an 11% loss in share of votes for the poll chosen.

=== 2007 legislative elections ===
Since 1999, when Vladimir Putin became President of Russia there has been increasing international criticism of the conduct of Russian elections. European institutions who observed the December 2007 legislative elections concluded that these were not fair elections. Göran Lennmarker, president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that the elections &quot;failed to meet many of the commitments and standards that we have. It was not a fair election.&quot; Luc Van den Brande, who headed a delegation from the Council of Europe, referred to the &quot;overwhelming influence of the president&#x27;s office and the president on the campaign&quot; and said there was &quot;abuse of administrative resources&quot; designed to influence the outcome. He also said there were &quot;flaws in the secrecy of the vote.&quot; &quot;Effectively, we can&#x27;t say these were fair elections,&quot; he said at a news conference.

In February 2008, the human rights organisation Amnesty International said that the presidential election on 2 March would not be a genuine election: &quot;There is no real opposition ahead of the election. There is no real electoral campaign battle,&quot; Friederike Behr, Amnesty&#x27;s Russia researcher, was quoted as saying. In a report on the elections, Amnesty said laws restricting non-government organizations, police breaking up demonstrations, and harassment from critics were all part of &quot;a systematic destruction of civil liberties in Russia.&quot; Another human rights organisation, Freedom House, said that the victory of Putin&#x27;s party in the 2007 elections &quot;was achieved under patently unfair and non-competitive conditions calling into doubt the result’s legitimacy.&quot;

The Russian government has acted to prevent international observers monitoring Russian elections. In 2007 the OSCE was prevented from monitoring the legislative elections held in December. In February 2008 the European Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights announced that it would not send observers to monitor the presidential election on 2 March, citing what it called &quot;severe restrictions&quot; imposed on its work by the Russian government. &quot;We made every effort in good faith to deploy our mission, even under the conditions imposed by the Russian authorities&quot;, said Christian Strohal, the organization&#x27;s director. &quot;The Russian Federation has created limitations that are not conducive to undertaking election observation&quot;. The OSCE has also withdrawn its attempts to monitor the elections.

=== 2011 legislative elections ===

The 2011 Russian legislative elections were considered to be rigged in favor of the ruling party by a number of journalists and opposition representatives. However public opinion-polls prior to the election suggested that the ruling party could count on the support of 45–55 percent of voters, which may suggest that there were no mass falsifications, despite isolated cases of fraud. Nationwide exit polls were very close to the final results.

=== 2016 Russian legislative election ===

In 2015, the OSCE called on the Russian government to respect and support the work of independent election observers. This followed a number of incidents where citizen observers were beaten or harassed during regional elections. There were also accusations of widespread voter nudging to increase attendance in unpopular or controversial votes by offering financial bonuses for everyone attending, such as free food, toys, etc.

=== 2021 Russian legislative election ===

In the 2021 State Duma elections, the Putin appointed government headed by Mikhail Mishustin prevented OSCE observers from taking part in Russian elections. Citing COVID-19 restrictions, officials severely restricted their capacity and access.

=== 2024 Russian presidential election ===

The United States criticized voting during 2024 Russian presidential election in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine and would &quot;never recognize the legitimacy or outcome of these sham elections held in sovereign Ukraine.&quot; The UN Security Council condemned the election held in occupied territories of Ukraine and the UN deputy secretary-general Rosemary DiCarlo stated that “holding elections in another UN member state’s territory without its consent is in manifest disregard for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity” and were “invalid”. Ukraine&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya released a joint statement on behalf of Ukraine, the European Union, US and 56 other countries condemning the holding of these elections in occupied parts of Ukraine. 

The Ukrainian foreign ministry called &quot;to refrain from referring to this farce as &#x27;elections&#x27; in the language of democratic states.&quot; 
European Council president Charles Michel congratulated Putin for winning the election before the election officially concluded, adding that there was &quot;No opposition. No freedom. No choice.”

<text>USS &quot;Lafayette&quot; (SSBN-616), the lead ship of her class of ballistic missile submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named to honor Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a French military hero who fought alongside and significantly aided the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Lafayette&quot;″s keel was laid down on 17 January 1961 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 8 May 1962, sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, and commissioned 23 April 1963 at Groton, Connecticut, with Commander P. J. Hannifin in command of the Blue Crew and Commander James T. Strong in command of the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
After a shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Lafayette&quot; loaded Polaris ballistic missiles at Charleston, South Carolina, and during June 1963 sailed to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for ballistic missile maneuvers. She fired four missiles, two by each crew, after which she proceeded to Groton, arriving there on 2 August 1963. For the rest of the year her two crews alternately took her through a series of exercises before she took her place in the Navy″s expanding fleet ballistic missile submarine fleet.

&quot;Lafayette&quot; departed Charleston on 4 January 1964 for her first deterrent patrol in the Atlantic Ocean. During the next four years, &quot;Lafayette&quot; made 16 deterrent patrols out of Rota, Spain. Her 15th patrol, the 400th of the Polaris submarine fleet, won &quot;Lafayette&quot; special commendation from Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze. She returned to Charleston from her 16th patrol on 23 August 1967. A week later, she arrived at Newport News, Virginia, for a major overhaul by Newport News Shipbuilding to prepare for future service. On 28 December 1968, &quot;Lafayette&quot;″s overhaul officially ended and in January 1969, she once again took up her position with the fleet.

On 18 May 1969, &quot;Lafayette&quot; departed Charleston, South Carolina, for her 17th Polaris patrol, and before the year was out, logged two more such evolutions. During 1970, she conducted four more (Patrols 20-23 inclusive). &quot;Lafayette&quot;, her Gold Crew on board, departed on Patrol 24 in January 1971, returning in March to Rota whereupon the Blue Crew prepared for Patrol 25, departing in April and returning in June. Subsequently, the Gold Crew conducted Patrol 26 from July until September. On 1 September, &quot;Lafayette&quot; launched five Polaris A-2 missiles; the boat&#x27;s performance during the ensuing &quot;operation of great importance to the United States Government [1–30 September 1971],&quot; during which time she &quot;maintained an impressively high state of readiness and demonstrated conclusively the effectiveness and dependability of the Fleet Ballistic Missile System ... attested to the professional competence, technical skill and sustained team effort&quot; of &quot;Lafayette&quot; Gold Crew, earning them a Meritorious Unit Commendation (awarded 11 May 1973). Soon thereafter, the Blue Crew carried out Patrol 27. Upon &quot;Lafayette&quot;″s return in October, the Gold Crew made ready for Patrol 28, departing in December.

During the first few months of 1972, &quot;Lafayette&quot; successfully completed and undertook three Polaris patrols, as well as transited from Rota to New London, Connecticut. Following her arrival at the latter port, she performed weekly operations in support of Commander Submarine Force, Atlantic&#x27;s, Second-Class Midshipmen Submarine Summer Indoctrination, continuing until September, during which time she provided underway training for over 1,000 midshipmen. Rear Admiral Paul J. Early, Commander Submarine Flotilla 2, later commended &quot;Lafayette&quot; for her &quot;careful preparation and superb execution which characterized your participating in this vital program. Midshipmen reaction was consistently favorable. Such a response is clear evidence of a sustained, dedicated effort on the part of the Commanding Officer and Crew and reflects admirable standards of leadership and performance.&quot;

Dr. Franklin B. Lincoln Jr., a member of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, toured Lafayette on 27 June and received a briefing &quot;on the operations and conditions aboard [sic] a Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarine.&quot; On 23 August, the boat hosted a large group of students from the Naval War College, Newport, R.I., &quot;for the purpose of [their] obtaining insight into the operational capabilities and limitations, manning and habitability of the modern FBM submarine.&quot; Mr. Leif Leifland, Minister Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary to the Royal Swedish Embassy embarked for a tour on 2 October; Rear Admiral Edwin E. McMorries (SC), Commanding Officer, Ships Parts Control Center, Mechanicsburg, Pa., visited the boat on 3 October; two days later, author Joseph M. Duckert visited Lafayette in the course of gathering information &quot;for his latest book, Nuclear Ships of the World.&quot;

Having completed sound trials, &quot;Lafayette&quot; conducted a weapons off-load to prepare for entrance into the Electric Boat yard for what was slated to be an 18-month overhaul and conversion to enable her to employ the new Poseidon missile. Following that, the Blue and Gold Crews combined into a single overhaul crew on 6 October 1972, &quot;Lafayette&quot; entering the shipyard on the 13th.

&quot;Lafayette&quot; lay in the yard for the remainder of 1972 and all of 1973, and ultimately emerged from her conversion work at Electric Boat (&quot;schedule slippage [due to] work force dilution at these yards [Electric Boat and Newport News] which have high current and projected workload&quot;) on 7 November 1974. She then embarked Vice Admiral Joe Williams, Jr., Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, who observed post-overhaul shakedown training (24–29 November). On 16 December, while operating out of Port Canaveral, Lafayette&#x27;s Blue Crew conducted the successful launch of a Poseidon C-3 missile as part of her post-availability shakedown, making &quot;Lafayette&quot; the first of her class to fire one of those weapons. Rear Admiral Levering Smith, Director, Strategic Systems Project Office, Rear Admiral Albert L. Kelln, Commander, Submarine Group 6, and Brig. Gen. J. H. Ahmann, Commander, Air Force Eastern Test Range, witnessed the test. The Blue Crew completed post-overhaul shakedown training on 21 January 1975 having visited Charleston, S.C., Port Canaveral, Fla., and Exuma Sound, Bahamas, during the course of those evolutions; relieved by the Gold Crew at Charleston, the latter conducted their post-overhaul shakedown training, conducting Weapons System Accuracy Trials (WSAT) at St. Croix, Virgin Islands, and Mk. 48 Torpedo Certification in Exuma Sound. Following another crew exchange at Charleston, the Blue Crew carried out Mk. 48 Torpedo Certification in Exuma Sound, and took &quot;Lafayette&quot; to Groton for an eight-month post-conversion availability. Returning to Charleston to exchange crews, Lafayette conducted two more patrols, 31 and 32, to round out the year.

During the first half of 1976, &quot;Lafayette&quot; carried out Patrols 33 (Gold) and 34 (Blue) from Holy Loch; her Gold Crew conducted Patrol 35, carrying out evolutions in the eastern Atlantic, after which time the boat fired a Mk. 48 torpedo proficiency in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. Following the Blue Crew&#x27;s conducting the next refit at Charleston, Lafayette conducted torpedo proficiency work in the Tongue of the Ocean, and local operations off the eastern seaboard, then Patrol 36. The Gold Crew relieved the Blue at Holy Loch in January 1977, and the two crews alternated conducting Poseidon deterrent patrols (37-40) from that site. In June of that year (1977), &quot;Lafayette&quot;, to demonstrate &quot;the continuing effectiveness of the Fleet Ballistic Missile weapon system,&quot; launched two Poseidon missiles in an operational test.

&quot;Lafayette&quot; completed Patrols 41 and 42 in the first half of 1978. Patrol 41 included operations in the Eastern Atlantic followed by an Mk. 48 torpedo proficiency firing period at the AUTEC range near Bermuda. Subsequently, the Blue Crew conducted refit at Charleston, after which Lafayette performed Mk. 48 torpedo proficiency firings at the AUTEC range and midshipman training out of New London and Charleston. Relieving the Blue Crew at Holy Loch, the Gold Crew conducted a refit there, thereafter carrying out Patrol 43. Following that, the Blue Crew relieved the Gold Crew in December. The New Year 1979 saw the crews completing Patrols 44 and 45. Thereafter, refit periods took place in Holy Loch. Patrols 46 and 47 took place in the second half of the year; 46 included operations in the Eastern Atlantic followed by an Mk. 48 torpedo proficiency firing period at the AUTEC range near Bermuda, with the Gold Crew conducting a subsequent refit in King&#x27;s Bay, Georgia. Upon completion of the refit, the Gold Crew again conducted an Mk. 48 torpedo proficiency firing at the AUTEC range near Bermuda, after which they enjoyed a port call at Port Canaveral, Florida.

For the first eleven months of 1980, &quot;Lafayette&quot; conducted Patrols 48, 49 and 50, interspersed with refits at Holy Loch. In December, the combined crew refitted the boat at Groton. In early January 1981, she hosted a dependents cruise from New London to Norfolk, Virginia. Subsequently, Lafayette got underway for Patrol 51. In February, she completed a missile offload in Charleston in preparation for arriving at the shipyard on 2 March, and on the 6th, entered the newly constructed dry dock at Newport News for an extended refuelling overhaul. She then spent the rest of 1982 in Newport News.

On 23 April 1983, &quot;Lafayette&quot; celebrated the 20th anniversary of her commissioning. Although the ship had already completed Alpha and Bravo sea trials while in the shipyard, a change of command ceremony held on 20 May officially welcomed her back into the operational fleet. Both crews subsequently completed a shakedown period consisting of an Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination (ORSE), a Mk. 48 torpedo certification, a demonstration and shakedown operation and a Nuclear Weapons Acceptance Inspection. Following this, on 28 December, the Gold crew began a post-overhaul upkeep in Charleston, awaiting deployment for Patrol 52. Throughout 1984, she participated in operations in conjunction with Submarine Squadron 14 (to which she had been reassigned), based at Holy Loch.

&quot;Lafayette&quot; began 1985 with a refit at Holy Loch in preparation for Patrol 56, after which the Gold Crew achieved superior results on the ORSE. Subsequently, the Blue Crew completed a refit and Patrol 57, which included a Tactical Readiness Evaluation and a Navy Technical Proficiency Inspection at its conclusion. The Gold Crew relieved the Blue in June, refitting the ship and thereafter conducting Patrol 58, at the end of which they passed a Defense Nuclear Surety Inspection, a Navy Technical Proficiency Inspection and a Tactical Readiness Evaluation. Following that, the Blue Crew refitted the boat and executed Patrol 59.

On 30 January 1986, while moored alongside the large auxiliary floating dry dock , &quot;Lafayette&quot; suffered serious damage during high winds. Docked in &quot;Los Alamos&quot; with less than 24-hour notice (for which the dry dock received a letter of appreciation), &quot;Lafayette&quot; underwent repairs (1–25 February) which delayed the start of her patrol. After completion of the necessary work, the Gold Crew took the boat out for Patrol 60, with the crew passing an ORSE. The Blue Crew then completed a refit and got underway for Patrol 61, and following this, completed a Tactical Readiness Evaluation and a Navy Technical Proficiency Inspection. By July, the Gold Crew was again on board, undertaking Patrol 62, and thereafter, conducted an unscheduled ORSE and a Tactical Readiness Evaluation. Relieving them in November, the Blue Crew, after completion of a refit, commenced Patrol 63.

Upon completion of Patrol 63, &quot;Lafayette&quot; transited to Charleston Weapons Station on 20 February 1987 and, after shipyard maintenance, departed Charleston for Patrol 64. While egressing the port, she was slightly off course and technically ran aground, even though it was just dragging the rudder through the mud. She was ordered to moor at Charleston Navy Base pending a Board of Inquiry. Three days later, she set sail and performed Patrols 64 to 66, (20 February-27 May, 28 May-5 September, 6 September-15 December respectively) returning to Holy Loch to refit. Subsequently, she got underway on 16 December for Patrol 67, during which she enjoyed a port visit in Lisbon, Portugal, from 24–29 February 1988. Underway on 25 March for Patrol 68, she returned to Holy Loch on 1 July. The following day, she commenced Patrol 69, returning on 11 October for refit, venturing out on 12 October to begin Patrol 70.

Subsequent to her completion of Patrol 70 on 19 January 1989, &quot;Lafayette&quot; stood out again on the 20th for Patrol 71 returning on 28 April. Following this, she commenced Patrol 72 on the 29th, during which she made the first port visit of an American submarine to Brest, France, where she participated in the Bastille Day celebrations. Following her return to Holy Loch on 6 August, the boat commenced Patrol 73 the next day. Completing Patrol 73 on 8 November, and Patrol 74 on 22 February 1990, &quot;Lafayette&quot; conducted a warm water refit at King&#x27;s Bay, then conducted Patrol 75, during the course of which she celebrated the 27th anniversary of her commissioning. Competing Patrol 75 on 12 May 1990, she completed her 76th, and last, patrol on 20 September 1990.

During a change of command ceremony at Groton on 5 October 1990, &quot;Lafayette&quot; became a one-crew submarine with the combination/transfer of the Blue and Gold Crews. Exhibiting her ability to continue to be &quot;an exceptionally quiet and capable platform,&quot; she subsequently exercised with attack submarine , and ultimately returned to Groton on 19 December 1990 to prepare for her interfleet transfer to Bremerton, Washington, under the operational control of Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, under the administrative control of Commander Submarine Group 9 for inactivation.

==Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal==

Deactivated while still in commission on 1 March 1991, &quot;Lafayette&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1991. Ex-&quot;Lafayette&quot; entered the Navy″s Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, the day she was stricken. Recycling of Ex-&quot;Lafayette&quot; was completed on 25 February 1992.
