<doc id="409568" wikidata="Q2347146" url="?curid=409568" title="Aerdenhout">
<text>Aerdenhout () is a village in the municipality of Bloemendaal, Netherlands. Located in the dunes between Haarlem and the beach town of Zandvoort, it ranks as the wealthiest town in the Netherlands. The name &quot;&quot; means , Dutch for &quot;the other wood&quot;, and was given it to distinguish this other wood from the Haarlemmerhout, just south of the city Haarlem.

==Commuter town==
Aerdenhout functions mostly as a suburb for wealthy commuters to Haarlem, Amsterdam, and other nearby cities. Residents of this village shop in nearby Heemstede, as Aerdenhout has virtually no shops.

The village Aerdenhout is dominated by many stately homes and villas, each with a unique style or architecture, and mostly built in the period 1920–1930. A much older building is the &quot;&quot;Haringbuys&quot;, an old pub along the Zandvoorterweg. In old times fishermen from Zandvoort walked with their stocks through the dunes to the open market in Haarlem and they would take some rest and drink in the Haringbuys. Opposite this place is another old house situated: &quot;Bosch en Landzigt&quot;&quot;. This is probably the oldest house in Aerdenhout. Actually, several people are living in this big building of which the cellars are several centuries old. There are still a few old trees in the garden. In the 20th century, mainly the families van Randwijck and Bierens de Haan were living in this historical house in Aerdenhout.

A special villa was Het Kareol. This large estate with a high water tower that could be seen from the train, was situated in a park with a small forest on the Van Lennepweg. The house was built in 1908 by the German owner Mr. Bunge who spent a lot of money on its construction. He liked the music of Richard Wagner and there were many tiles in the house with pictures referring to the opera Tristan and Isolde by Wagner. During the Second World War, the house was used as a sanatorium for wounded soldiers and suffered some damage. The Dutch Military Victims Association still has a magazine named &quot;the Kareoler&quot;. The house was demolished in the seventies and an apartment building was built on the same spot. The park grounds have been preserved.

During recent years, many new houses have been built in Aerdenhout without their own style, changing the character of the village.

==Sports clubs==
Aerdenhout is home to the mixed Field Hockey Club &quot;Rood-Wit&quot; on the Zwaluwenweg 11.

==Railway transportation==
In 1876, the railway station Heemstede-Aerdenhout railway station opened on the Amsterdam-Haarlem-Rotterdam railway line. It closed in 1880, but reopened in 1928.

==Notable residents==
While the general Bloemendaal area is wealthy, it is not known for its celebrities. Notable people who live or lived in Aerdenhout include:
*Wubbo Ockels - First Dutchman in space
*Roel Pieper - Businessman and ex-vice president of the Phillips Corp
*Michael van Praag - former President of the Royal Dutch Football Association and former chairman of AFC Ajax
*Albert Heijn - Founder&#x27;s son and previous owner of Ahold, one of the largest corporations in the Netherlands
*Dirk van den Broek - Businessman and founder of the Samenwerkende Dirk van den Broek Bedrijven.
*Family Bleekemolen - Racing family, father Michael Bleekemolen and his two sons Sebastiaan and Jeroen.
*Martijn Bolkestein - Member of the House of Representatives
*Gijs van Lennep - Racing driver

<doc id="409570" wikidata="Q66004929" url="?curid=409570" title="Peerage of Scotland">
<text>The Peerage of Scotland (; ) is one of the five divisions of peerages in the United Kingdom and for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707. Following that year&#x27;s Treaty of Union, the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain, and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created.

Scottish Peers were entitled to sit in the ancient Parliament of Scotland. After the Union, the Peers of the old Parliament of Scotland elected 16 Scottish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster. The Peerage Act 1963 granted all Scottish Peers the right to sit in the House of Lords, but this automatic right was revoked, as for all hereditary peerages (except those of the incumbent Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain), when the House of Lords Act 1999 received the Royal Assent.

Unlike most peerages, many Scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring (thus an Italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of Newburgh), and in the case of daughters only, these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance (as is the case with ancient English baronies by writ of summons). Unlike other British peerage titles, Scots law permits peerages to be inherited by or through a person who was not legitimate at birth, but was subsequently legitimised by their parents marrying later.

The ranks of the Scottish Peerage are, in ascending order: Lord of Parliament, Viscount, Earl, Marquess and Duke. Scottish Viscounts differ from those of the other Peerages (of England, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom) by using the style &quot;of&quot; in their title, as in Viscount &quot;of&quot; Oxfuird. Though this is the theoretical form, most Viscounts drop the &quot;&quot;of&quot;. The Viscount of Arbuthnott and to a lesser extent the Viscount of Oxfuird still use &quot;of&quot;&quot;.

The Peerage of Scotland differs from those of England and Ireland in that its lowest rank is not that of baron. In Scotland, &quot;baron&quot; is a rank within the Baronage of Scotland, considered noble but not a peer, equivalent to a baron in some continental countries. The Scottish equivalent to the English or Irish baron is a Lord of Parliament. Barons in Scotland were historically feudal barons until 2004, when a change in Scottish law abolished the feudal system. This reform &quot;expressly preserves the dignity of baron... and any other dignity or office, whether or not of feudal origin,&quot; converting feudal titles into non-territorial dignities—personal titles no longer attached to the land, including the quality, precedence, and heraldic rights pertaining.

In the following table of the Peerage of Scotland as it currently stands, each peer&#x27;s highest ranking title in the other peerages (if any) are also listed. Those peers who are known by a higher title in one of the other peerages are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.

<text>Geleen (; ) is a city in the southern part of the province of Limburg in the Netherlands. With 31,670 inhabitants in 2020, it is part of the municipality of Sittard-Geleen. Geleen is situated along the river Geleenbeek, a right tributary to the river Meuse. The Latin name for Geleenbeek is &quot;Glana&quot;, meaning &quot;clear river&quot;. The town centre is situated at about 60 m above sea level.

==History==
Until the end of the 19th century, Geleen was a very small village. Its population was 2,545 in 1899. The remains of one of the oldest prehistoric farms in the Netherlands were found here. In the 20th century the exploitation of coal mines in this area (the state-owned coal mine &quot;Maurits&quot;, the biggest in Europe, was located in Geleen) brought a fast population increase. During the 1960s and 1970s the Dutch coal mines, which were all located in this part of the province, were closed. The state mining company DSM (privatised in 1989) remained active in Geleen, however, now purely as a chemicals producer. In July 2002, part of DSM&#x27;s petrochemicals business, located on the manufacturing locations in Geleen and Gelsenkirchen (Germany) were acquired by SABIC Europe.

<doc id="409573" wikidata="Q12829733" url="?curid=409573" title="Belém">
<text>Belém (; Portuguese for Bethlehem; initially called Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão-Pará, in English Our Lady of Bethlehem of Great Pará), often called Belém of Pará, is the capital and largest city of the state of Pará in the north of Brazil. It is the gateway to the Amazon River with a busy port, airport, and bus/coach station. Belém lies approximately 100 km (62.1 miles) upriver from the Atlantic Ocean, on the Pará River, which is part of the greater Amazon River system, separated from the larger part of the Amazon delta by &quot;Ilha de Marajó&quot; (Marajo Island). With an estimated population of 1,303,403 people — or 2,491,052, considering its metropolitan area — it is the 12th most populous city in Brazil, as well as the 16th by economic relevance. It is the second largest in the North Region, second only to Manaus, in the state of Amazonas.

Founded in 1616 by the Kingdom of Portugal, Belém was the first European colony on the Amazon but did not become part of Brazil until 1775. The newer part of the city has modern buildings and skyscrapers. The colonial portion retains the charm of tree-filled squares, churches and traditional blue tiles. The city has a rich history and architecture from colonial times. Recently, it witnessed a skyscraper boom.

Belém is also known as the &quot;Metropolis of the Brazilian Amazon region&quot; or the &quot;Cidade das Mangueiras&quot; (City of Mango Trees) due to the vast number of those trees found in the city. Brazilians often refer to the city as &quot;Belém do Pará&quot; (&quot;Belém of Pará&quot;) rather than just &quot;Belém&quot;, a reference to an earlier name for the city, &quot;Santa Maria de Belém do Grão Pará&quot; (&quot;Saint Mary of Bethlehem of Great Pará&quot;), and also to differentiate it from a number of other towns called Belém in Brazil, as well as the city of Bethlehem in the West Bank of Palestine. It is named after Santa Maria de Belém in Lisbon, also better known by its shortened name, Belém.

Belém is served by Belém International Airport, which connects the city with the rest of Brazil and other cities in South America, North America (United States) and Europe (Lisbon). The city is also home to the Federal University of Pará and the State University of Pará.

==Etymology==

Belém is the Portuguese name for Bethlehem, and has its origin in Hebrew which means &quot;the house of bread&quot;. Initially the city was called &quot;St. Mary of Bethlehem of Pará&quot; () or &quot;Our Lady of Bethlehem of Greater Pará&quot; (), eventually shortened to &quot;Belém do Pará&quot; (name given by Philip III of Spain), in reference to Christmas; the day when captain Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco left from the city of São Luís in 1615 to conquer the lands of Pará.

==History==

In 1615, Portuguese captain-general Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco of the captaincy of Bahia commanded a military expedition sent by the Governor General of Brazil to check the trading excursions of foreigners (French, Dutch, English) up the river (Amazon) from the Cabo do Norte in Grão Pará.

On January 12, 1616, he anchored in what is now known as Guajará Bay, formed by the confluence of the Para and Guamá Rivers, called by the Tupinambás, &quot;Guaçu Paraná&quot;. Caldeira mistook the bay for the main channel, and thirty leagues (178 km) upstream, he built a wooden fort, covered with straw, which he called &quot;Presépio&quot; (nativity scene), now known as &quot;Forte do Castelo&quot;. The colony formed by the fort was given the name Feliz Lusitânia, &quot;Fortunate Lusitania&quot;. It was the embryo of the future city of Belém. The fort failed to suppress Dutch and French trading, but did ward off colonization.

Feliz Lusitânia was later called Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará (Our Lady of Bethlehem of Grao-Para) and Santa Maria de Belém (St. Mary of Bethlehem). Belém was given city status in 1655 and was made capital of the State when Pará state was split off from Maranhão in 1772. The early decades of the 19th century were marked by political instability. Uprisings and internecine strife finally ended in 1836, after considerable loss of life.

The sugar trade in the Belém region was important up to the end of the 17th century. Thereafter the city&#x27;s economic importance alternately rose and fell. Cattle ranching supplanted sugar until the 18th century, when cultivation of rice, cotton and coffee became profitable. With the settlement of southern Brazil, where such crops could be produced more efficiently, Belém declined again. The city subsequently became the main exporting centre of the Amazon rubber industry, and by 1866 its position was further enhanced by the opening of the Amazon, Tocantins and Tapajós rivers to navigation. The importance of Belém was then somewhat reduced by the development of the Port of Manaus upriver. The rubber era ended after the boom of 1910–12, but Belém continued to be the main commercial centre of northern Brazil and the entrepôt for the Amazon valley.

== Geography ==
The municipality includes the islands of Mosqueiro, fringed by 14 freshwater beaches, and Caratateua which receive a large number of visitors in summertime. In addition to these and also near Belém, is the island of Tatuoca which is the location of one of the seven geophysical stations in the world, and the only station in Latin America.

===Climate===
Belém has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;) more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the maritime trade winds, and with no cyclones, that is a true equatorial climate. In all 12 months of the year, the city on average sees more than 60 mm of rainfall, so the city has no true dry season month. However, Belém features noticeably wetter and drier seasons. The wetter season spans from December through May, while the drier season covers the remaining six months of the year. Like many cities with a tropical rainforest climate, average temperatures vary little throughout the course of the year, generally hovering around 26.5 degrees Celsius. Due to its location in the Amazon, tropical rainforest is the natural vegetation in and around the city.

===Vegetation===

The Amazon represents more than half the planet&#x27;s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.

==Economy==

Many valuable products now exported from the Amazon by way of Belém are aluminium, iron ore, and other metals, nuts (chiefly Brazil nuts), pineapples, cassava, jute, wood veneers, and hardwoods. Japanese immigration after the 1930s was an important factor in developing jute and black pepper, notably at Tomé-Açu, just south of Belém, and near Santarém. Marajó Island, the largest fluvial island in the world, which lies just across the Rio Pará from Belém, has some livestock grazing. Electricity is provided by the massive Tucuruí Dam, some 300 km southwest of the city on the Tocantins River.

==Demographics==

According to the IBGE of 2018, there were 2,491,052 people residing in the Metropolitan Region of Belém. This region is composed by 7 cities: Belém (1,485.732 people), Ananindeua (525,566 people), Marituba (129,321 people), Benevides (61,689 people), Santa Bárbara do Pará (20,704 people), Santa Izabel do Pará (69,746 people), and Castanhal (198,294 people). In 2012, according to IBGE, the capital city itself had a population density of . The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 806,103 Pardo (Multiracial) people (61.8%), 342,476 White (26.3%), 149,395 Black (11.5%), 3,298 Asian people (0.3%) and 2,069 Amerindian people (0.2%).

According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, the ancestral composition of the population of Belém is: 68.6% European ancestry, followed by 20.9% Amerindian ancestry and 10.6% African ancestry.

== Education ==
Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

===Education institutions===
* Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA);
* Universidade do Estado do Pará (UEPA);
* Federal Rural University of Amazonia (UFRA);
* Universidade da Amazônia (UNAMA);
* Centro de Instrução Almirante Brás de Aguiar (CIABA);
* Centro Universitário do Estado do Pará (Cesupa);
* Amazon Valley Academy International School (AVA);
* Escola Superior da Amazônia (UNIESAMAZ);
* Centro Universitário Metropolitano da Amazônia (UNIFAMAZ)
* Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Pará (IFPA)

==Culture==

===Círio de Nazaré===
On the second Sunday in October, Pará celebrates the largest religious event in Brazil: the procession of the Círio of Nazaré. This tradition started when a farmer and lumberman called Plácido José de Souza found an image of the Virgin and Child on the edge of the Murucutu creek, where the Basilica of Our Lady of Nazareth of Exile stands today. He decided to take the image home. However, the image would mysteriously go back to the place where it was initially found every time he took it home. So Plácido decided to build a small chapel on the edge of the creek. This episode was regarded as miraculous throughout the region. It attracted hundreds of believers to see the image and pay homage to it.
Since then, the Círio has been celebrated as a long procession lasting around five hours, in which thousands of people follow the statue through the streets of Belém. The Círio festival is regarded as the &quot;Christmas of the Amazon&quot; because everyone is involved in the arrangements to receive the saint. In early September, minor celebrations take place as a spiritual preparation for the Círio, with thousands of images scattered all over the capital and neighboring cities.

In time it became necessary to incorporate new elements into the tradition due to the people&#x27;s desire to honor their patron saint. On the Saturday morning prior to the Círio procession the statue is taken to the square of Ananindeua, a nearby city, to begin a Road Pilgrimage to the Icoaraci pier for a Mass. The river pilgrimage then begins. It was created to honor the &quot;water men&quot; who regard the Virgin of Nazareth as their patron saint. There is a traditional ship contest to award the most originally decorated boat. When the Sacred Image leaves Icoaraci in a Navy Corvette, it is followed by dozens of boats and ships through the waters of Guajará Bay to the pier of Belém, from where it is escorted all the way to the Gentil Bittencourt School. The subsequent candle-lit procession symbolizes the story of the discovery of the Saint and its return to where it was found. The procession follows the Carriage, to which a huge rope is tied, which is carried by the faithful until the procession arrives at the Sé Cathedral.

During the procession, there is a fireworks show, sponsored by the Stevedores&#x27; Union, marking the passage of the Saint until its arrival at the Cathedral. At daybreak of the next day, the faithful start to gather at the Old City, believing that this will bring them closer to the Virgin. At 7 o&#x27;clock, the archbishop conducts the image to the carriage as bells toll and fireworks explode. The main procession then goes through the streets of the city to the Architectonic Centre of Nazareth, known for its Sanctuary Square. As it arrives at the square, the image is removed from the carriage for the celebration of a Mass and then lifted so that everybody will be blessed by the patron saint of Pará.

The festivities last 15 days, with religious celebrations, like the Children&#x27;s Círio, and its procession, held two Sundays after the Círio. The Re-Círio marks the end of the celebrations, with a shorter course back to the Gentil Bittencourt chapel.

===Convention and Fair Centre of the Amazon===
Built in a 23,000-square-metre area, the Hangar Convention and Fair Center of the Amazon has 12 rooms, ticket offices, baggage keeping, press room, and a food court, distributed in two big buildings with a parking lot for 800 vehicles. Genuine Amazonian trees will soon be planted in the outdoor area. With Hangar, Belém joins the market for national conventions that take place in a different city each time, such as the Brazilian Computer Society Congress. National conventions had not been held in the Northern region previously.

Hangar, whose auditorium has room for 2,160 participants, has some of the best technologies available in the world and is the most modern and functional space for events in the country. According to the Brazilian Association of Convention and Fair Centers (ABRACCEF), there are 17,500 events happening on average throughout the 53 main convention and exhibition centres of Brazil. These activities bring together approximately 28 million participants. Belém has great potential for this type of tourism.

===Architecture===

In many ways, Belém&#x27;s colonial architecture reflects the seventeenth-century architecture of Lisbon in Portugal which served as the inspiration for the main housing projects of the time, with the frequent use of tile-hung façades. Neoclassical architecture is also present in buildings such as the Theatro da Paz, built in 1874. Many of the buildings at the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century also echo French architecture.

===Cuisine===
The local Amerindian culture makes use of local ingredients to create the colors and flavors of its cuisine. One such ingredient, a fruit named &quot;Cupuaçu&quot;, comes from the Cupuaçu tree, found in the Amazonian forest. Cupuaçu is easily identified by its unique smell and sour taste. Its pulp is also extracted to make juices, candies, jellies, liquors, and ice cream. Açaí is a palm tree with a long, thin stem. The palm fruits from this tree are purple in color with a earthy and fruity taste. Long prized by the local population, it recently it has also reached the national menu.

Belém has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of gastronomy since 2015.

<doc id="409576" wikidata="Q156472" url="?curid=409576" title="Witold Lutosławski">
<text>Witold Roman Lutosławski (; 25 January 1913 – 7 February 1994) was a Polish composer and conductor. Among the major composers of 20th-century classical music, he is &quot;generally regarded as the most significant Polish composer since Szymanowski, and possibly the greatest Polish composer since Chopin&quot;. His compositions—of which he was a notable conductor—include representatives of most traditional genres, aside from opera: symphonies, concertos, orchestral song cycles, other orchestral works, and chamber works. Among his best known works are his four symphonies, the Variations on a Theme by Paganini (1941), the Concerto for Orchestra (1954), and his cello concerto (1970).

During his youth, Lutosławski studied piano and composition in Warsaw. His early works were influenced by Polish folk music and demonstrated a wide range of rich atmospheric textures. His folk-inspired music includes the Concerto for Orchestra (1954)—which first brought him international renown—and &quot;Dance Preludes&quot; (1955), which he described as a &quot;farewell to folklore&quot;. From the late 1950s he began developing new, characteristic composition techniques. He introduced limited aleatoric elements, while retaining tight control of his music&#x27;s material, architecture, and performance. He also evolved his practice of building harmonies from small groups of musical intervals.

During World War II, after narrowly escaping German capture, Lutosławski made a living playing the piano in Warsaw bars. After the war, Stalinist authorities banned his First Symphony for being &quot;formalist&quot;: accessible only to an elite. Rejecting anti-formalism as an unjustified retrograde step, Lutosławski resolutely strove to maintain his artistic integrity, providing artistic support to the Solidarity movement throughout the 1980s. He received numerous awards and honours, including the Grawemeyer Award and a Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal. In 1994, Lutosławski was awarded Poland&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle.

==Life and career==
===Early years (1913–1938)===
Witold Roman Lutosławski was born on 25 January 1913, in Warsaw, Poland. His parents were both born into the Polish landed nobility; they owned estates in the area of Drozdowo. His father Józef was involved in the Polish National Democratic Party (&quot;Endecja&quot;), and the Lutosławski family became intimate with its founder, Roman Dmowski (Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s middle name was Roman). Józef Lutosławski studied in Zürich, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutosławski&#x27;s mother. Józef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the National-Democratic newspaper, &quot;Goniec&quot;. He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutosławski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of World War I.

In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, Prussian forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutosławskis travelled east to Moscow, where Józef remained politically active, organising Polish Legions ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which had been divided over a century earlier—Warsaw was part of Tsarist Russia). Dmowski&#x27;s strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. In 1917, the February Revolution forced the Tsar to abdicate, and the October Revolution started a new Soviet government that made peace with Germany. Józef&#x27;s activities were now in conflict with the Bolsheviks, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutosławskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in Butyrskaya prison in central Moscow, where Witold—by then aged five—visited his father. Józef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial.

After the war, the family returned to the newly independent Poland, only to find their estates ruined. After his father&#x27;s death, other members of the family played an important part in Witold&#x27;s early life, especially Józef&#x27;s half-brother Kazimierz Lutosławski, a priest and politician.

At age six, Lutosławski started two years of piano lessons in Warsaw. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother returned to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924, Lutosławski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski&#x27;s Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925, he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931, he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932, he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Toccata&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.

===World War II (1939–1945)===
Military service followed; Lutosławski was trained in signalling and radio operating in Zegrze near Warsaw. He completed his &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; in 1939. The work was premiered by the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Grzegorz Fitelberg, with the performance broadcast on radio on 9 March 1939. Like most young Polish composers, Lutosławski wanted to continue his education in Paris. His plans for further musical study were dashed in September 1939, when Germany invaded western Poland and Russia invaded eastern Poland. Lutosławski was mobilised with the radio unit for the Kraków Army. He was soon captured by German soldiers, but escaped while being marched to prison camp, walking back to Warsaw. Lutosławski&#x27;s brother was captured by Russian soldiers and later died in a Siberian labour camp.

To earn a living, Lutosławski joined &quot;Dana Ensemble&quot;, the first Polish revellers, as an arranger-pianist, singing in &quot;Ziemiańska Cafe&quot;. He then formed a piano duo with friend and fellow composer Andrzej Panufnik, performing together in Warsaw cafés. Their repertoire consisted of a wide range of music in their own arrangements, including the first incarnation of Lutosławski&#x27;s Variations on a Theme by Paganini, a transcription of the 24th Caprice for solo violin by Niccolò Paganini. Defiantly, they sometimes played Polish music (the Nazis banned Polish music in Poland—including that of Frédéric Chopin), and composed Resistance songs. Listening in cafés was the only way in which the Poles of German-occupied Warsaw could hear live music; putting on concerts was impossible since the Germans occupying Poland prohibited any organised gatherings. In café &quot;Aria&quot;, where they played, Lutosławski met his future wife Maria Danuta Bogusławska, a sister of the writer Stanisław Dygat.

Lutosławski left Warsaw in July 1944 with his mother, just a few days before the Warsaw Uprising. During the complete destruction of the city by Germans after the failure of the uprising, most of his music was lost, as were the family&#x27;s Drozdowo estates. He was able to salvage only a few scores and sketches; of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutosławski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutosławski&#x27;s Variations on a Theme by Paganini survived. Lutosławski returned to the ruins of Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.

===Post-war years (1946–1955)===
During the postwar years, Lutosławski worked on his First Symphony—sketches of which he had salvaged from Warsaw—which he had started in 1941. It was first performed in 1948, conducted by Fitelberg. To provide for his family, he also composed music that he termed &quot;functional&quot;, such as the &quot;Warsaw Suite&quot; (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city&#x27;s reconstruction), sets of &quot;Polish Carols&quot;, and the study pieces for piano, &quot;Melodie Ludowe&quot; (&quot;Folk Melodies&quot;).

In 1945, Lutosławski was elected as secretary and treasurer of the newly constituted Union of Polish Composers (ZKP—&quot;Związek Kompozytorów Polskich&quot;). In 1946, he married Danuta Bogusławska. The marriage was a lasting one, and Danuta&#x27;s drafting skills were of great value to the composer: she became his copyist, and solved some of the notational challenges of his later works.

In 1947, the Stalinist political climate led to the adoption and imposition by the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party of the tenets of socialist realism. The political authorities condemned new compositions deemed to be non-conformist. This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from Stalin personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole Eastern bloc, and was reinforced by the 1948 Zhdanov decree. By 1948, the ZKP was taken over by musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters. Lutosławski resigned from the committee, implacably opposed to the ideas of socialist realism.
Lutoslawski&#x27;s First Symphony was proscribed as &quot;formalist&quot;, and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to defect to the United Kingdom. Against this background, Lutosławski was content to compose pieces for which there was social need, but in 1954 this earned him—much to the composer&#x27;s chagrin—the Prime Minister&#x27;s Prize for a set of children&#x27;s songs. He commented: &quot;[I]t was for those functional compositions of mine that the authorities decorated me... I realised that I was not writing indifferent little pieces, only to make a living, but was carrying on an artistic creative activity in the eyes of the outside world.&quot;

It was his substantial and original Concerto for Orchestra of 1954 that established Lutosławski as an important composer of art music. The work, commissioned in 1950 by the conductor Witold Rowicki for the newly reconstituted Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, earned the composer two state prizes in the following year.

===Maturity (1956–1967)===
Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 allowed a certain relaxation of the cultural totalitarianism in Russia and its satellite states. By 1956, political events had led to a partial thawing of the musical climate, and the Warsaw Autumn Festival of Contemporary Music was founded. Conceived as a biennial festival, it has been held annually ever since 1958 (except under Martial law in 1982 when, in protest, the ZKP refused to organise it). The first performance of his &quot;Musique funèbre&quot; (in Polish, &quot;Muzyka żałobna&quot;, English &quot;Funereal Music&quot; or &quot;Music of Mourning&quot;) took place in 1958. It was written to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of Béla Bartók, but took the composer four years to complete. This work brought international recognition, and the annual ZKP prize and the International Rostrum of Composers prize in 1959. Lutosławski&#x27;s harmonic and contrapuntal thinking were developed in this work, and in the &quot;Five songs&quot; of 1956–57, as he introduced his twelve-note system, he realised the fruits of many years of thought and experiment. Another new feature of his compositional technique became a Lutosławski signature: he introduced randomness into the exact synchronisation of various parts of the musical ensemble in &quot;Jeux vénitiens&quot; (&quot;Venetian games&quot;). These harmonic and temporal techniques became part of every subsequent work, and were integral to his style.
In a departure from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym &quot;Derwid&quot;. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish &quot;actors&#x27; songs&quot;. Their place in Lutosławski&#x27;s output may be seen as less incongruous in light of his own performances of cabaret music during the war, as well as his relationship by marriage to his wife&#x27;s sister-in-law, the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik.

In 1963, Lutosławski fulfilled a commission for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his &quot;Trois poèmes d&#x27;Henri Michaux&quot; for chorus and orchestra. It was the first work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and he gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His String Quartet was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle &quot;Paroles tissées&quot;. This shortened title was suggested by the poet Jean-François Chabrun, who had published the poems as &quot;Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi&quot;. The song cycle is dedicated to the tenor Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. (The Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.)

Shortly after this, Lutosławski started work on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez conducted the second movement, &quot;Direct&quot;, in 1966, and when the first movement, &quot;Hésitant&quot;, was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The Second Symphony is very different from a conventional classical symphony in structure, with Lutosławski using his many compositional innovations to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the Symphony earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council&#x27;s International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, confirming his growing international reputation. In 1967, Lutosławski was awarded the Léonie Sonning Music Prize, Denmark&#x27;s highest musical honour.

===International renown (1967–1982)===

The Second Symphony, and &quot;Livre pour orchestre&quot; and a Cello Concerto which followed, were composed during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski&#x27;s life. His mother died in 1967, and in 1967–70 there was a great deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production &quot;Dziady&quot;, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich&#x27;s own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work&#x27;s première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s gold medal.

In 1973, Lutosławski attended a recital given by the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter in Warsaw; he met the singer after the concert and this inspired him to write his extended orchestral song &quot;Les Espaces du sommeil&quot; (&quot;The spaces of sleep&quot;). This work, &quot;Preludes and Fugue&quot;, &quot;Mi-Parti&quot; (a French expression that roughly translates as &quot;divided into two equal but different parts&quot;), &quot;Novelette&quot;, and a short piece for cello in honour of Paul Sacher&#x27;s seventieth birthday, occupied Lutosławski throughout the 1970s, while in the background he was working away at a projected Third symphony and a &quot;concertante&quot; piece for the oboist Heinz Holliger. These latter pieces were proving difficult to complete, as Lutosławski struggled to introduce greater fluency into his sound world and to reconcile tensions between the harmonic and melodic aspects of his style, and between foreground and background. The Double Concerto for oboe, harp and chamber orchestra—commissioned by Sacher—was finally finished in 1980, and the Third Symphony in 1983. In 1977, he received the Order of the Builders of People&#x27;s Poland. In 1983, he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.

During this period, Poland was undergoing yet more upheaval: in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981 to 1989, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland as a gesture of solidarity with the artists&#x27; boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, as a gesture of support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded the Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.

===Final years (1983–1994)===
Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski composed three pieces called &quot;Łańcuch&quot; (&quot;Chain&quot;), which refers to the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. &quot;Chain 2&quot; was written for Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier &quot;Partita&quot; for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude, and &quot;Chain 2&quot; form his longest work.

In 1985, the Third Symphony earned Lutosławski the first Grawemeyer Prize from the University of Louisville, Kentucky. The significance of the prize lay not just in its prestige but in the size of its financial award (then US$150,000). The award is intended to remove recipients&#x27; financial concerns for a period to allow them to concentrate on serious composition. In a gesture of altruism, Lutosławski announced that he would use the fund to set up a scholarship to enable young Polish composers to study abroad; Lutosławski also directed that his fee from the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for &quot;Chain 3&quot; should go to this scholarship fund.

In 1986, Lutosławski was presented (by Tippett) with the rarely awarded Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s Gold Medal during a concert in which Lutosławski conducted his Third Symphony; also that year a major celebration of his work was made at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival. In addition, he was awarded honorary doctorates at several universities worldwide, including Cambridge.

At this time Lutosławski was writing his Piano Concerto for Krystian Zimerman, commissioned by the Salzburg Festival. His earliest plans to write a piano concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a virtuoso pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer&#x27;s return to the conductor&#x27;s podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged between the government and the opposition.

Around 1990 Lutosławski also worked on a fourth symphony and his orchestral song-cycle &quot;Chantefleurs et Chantefables&quot; for soprano. The latter was first performed at a Prom concert in London in 1991, and the Fourth Symphony in 1993 in Los Angeles. In between, and after initial reluctance, Lutosławski took on the presidency of the newly reconstituted &quot;Polish Cultural Council&quot;, which was set up after the 1989 legislative elections led to the end of communist rule in Poland.

In 1993, Lutosławski continued his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, but by the first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February, aged 81. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.

==Music==

Lutosławski described musical composition as a search for listeners who think and feel the same way he did—he once called it &quot;fishing for souls&quot;.

=== Folk influence ===
Lutosławski&#x27;s works up until and including the &quot;Dance Preludes&quot; (1955) show the influence of Polish folk music, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, such as the Concerto for Orchestra, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis. As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, &quot;[in those days] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able&quot;, and about this change of direction he said, &quot;I was simply not so interested in it [using folk music]&quot;. Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a &quot;post-tonal&quot; idiom: while composing the first symphony, he felt that this was for him a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;. As such, &quot;Dance Preludes&quot; would prove to be his final composition centered around folk music; he described it as a &quot;farewell to folklore&quot;.

=== Pitch organisation ===
In &quot;Five Songs&quot; (1956–57) and &quot;Musique funèbre&quot; (1958) Lutosławski introduced his own brand of twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in &quot;Musique funèbre&quot;, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski&#x27;s twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s tone-row system, although &quot;Musique funèbre&quot; does happen to be based on a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Variations on a Theme by Paganini.

=== Aleatory technique ===

Although &quot;Musique funèbre&quot; was internationally acclaimed, his new harmonic techniques led to something of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot;. Although he was not influenced by the sound or the philosophy of the music, Cage&#x27;s explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His &quot;Three Postludes&quot; were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.

In works from &quot;Jeux vénitiens&quot;, Lutosławski wrote long passages in which the parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor, each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way, the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term &quot;aleatory&quot; are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.

For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had produced only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind them in a full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, as is the case with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutosławska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called &quot;mobiles&quot;), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor. Lutosławski&#x27;s called this technique of his mature period &quot;limited aleatorism&quot;.

Both Lutosławski&#x27;s harmonic and aleatory processes are illustrated by &quot;example 1&quot;, an excerpt from &quot;Hésitant&quot;, the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section is based on a 12-note chord built from major seconds and perfect fourths. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated (&quot;P.G. 2&quot; at top right of the example). The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F–G–A–C–D–D, arranged in such a way that the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the repeat sign, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This &quot;refrain&quot; (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.

=== Late style ===

The combination of Lutosławski&#x27;s aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries allowed him to build up complex musical textures. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an &quot;ad libitum&quot; coordination. This development first appeared in the brief &quot;Epitaph&quot; for oboe and piano, around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra.

Lutosławski&#x27;s formidable technical developments grew out of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is a testament to his resolution of purpose in the face of the anti-formalist authorities under which he formulated his methods.

==Legacy==
In the 21st century, Lutosławski is generally considered the most important Polish composer since Szymanowski, and perhaps the most outstanding since Chopin. This evaluation was not apparent after World WarII, when Panufnik was more highly regarded in Poland. The success of Lutosławski&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; and Panufnik&#x27;s 1954 defection to England brought Lutosławski to the forefront of modern Polish classical music. Initially, he was coupled with his younger contemporary Krzysztof Penderecki, due to their music&#x27;s shared stylistic and technical characteristics. When Penderecki&#x27;s reputation declined in the 1970s, Lutosławski emerged as the major Polish composer of his time and among the most significant 20th-century European composers. His four symphonies, the Variations on a Theme by Paganini (1941), the Concerto for Orchestra (1954), and a cello concerto (1970) are his best known works.

<text>The Worker-Communist Party of Iraq () is a Marxist political party in Iraq and amongst Iraqi exiles. Samir Adil is the current leader of the party. It was established in July 1993 through a merger of communist groups.

They opposed both Saddam Hussein and the American-led new administration. Under the Ba&#x27;athist regime, the group was persecuted, and so operated primarily in the Kurdistan region, and overseas in the United Kingdom and Australia (where they were among the founders of the Socialist Alliance).

The party was also persecuted in Kurdistan and went underground in 2000 after numbers of attacks by Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.

They are involved in the Federation of Workers Councils and Unions in Iraq, the Organization of Women&#x27;s Freedom in Iraq and the Union of the Unemployed in Iraq. They have produced a newsletter called &quot;Iraq Weekly&quot;&#x27; and an English newspaper called &quot;Forward&quot;.

It is a sister party of the Worker-Communist Party of Kurdistan and previously had a good relation with Worker-Communist Party of Iran - Hekmatist. In March 2005, members of the WCPI, along with members of other groups and other individuals, formed the Iraq Freedom Congress with the purpose of forming a secular and democratic Iraq.

<doc id="409578" wikidata="Q3247005" url="?curid=409578" title="Candida dubliniensis">
<text>Candida dubliniensis is a fungal opportunistic pathogen originally isolated from AIDS patients. It is also occasionally isolated from immunocompetent individuals. It is of the genus &quot;Candida&quot;, very closely related to &quot;Candida albicans&quot; but forming a distinct phylogenetic cluster in DNA fingerprinting. It is most commonly isolated from oral cavities, and is also occasionally found in other anatomical sites.

==Prevalence and epidemiology==
&quot;Candida dubliniensis&quot; is cosmopolitan (found around the world), and has been described as a separate species in 1995. Retrospective studies have shown that previously it had been commonly identified as &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, with which &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; is closely related and shares a number of characteristics.

One test for distinguishing &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; from &quot;C. albicans&quot;, is laboratory culture of the organism at 42 °C. Most &quot;C. albicans&quot; strains grow at this temperature, whereas most &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; isolates do not. There are also significant differences in the conditions that lead to the formation of chlamydospores between &quot;C. albicans&quot; and &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot;, although they are otherwise phenotypically very similar.

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center conducted several studies, both retrospective and prospective. In 974 germ-tube positive yeasts, 22 isolates (2.3%) from 16 patients were &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot;. All individuals were immunologically compromised with either malignancy or AIDS, and the isolates came from a variety of different sites. &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; was also isolated from the mouths of 18% of patients with diabetes and who use insulin.

==Antifungal susceptibility==
In one study, all 20 &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; isolates tested were susceptible to itraconazole, ketoconazole and amphotericin B.

===Fluconazole===
Many isolates of &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; are sensitive to fluconazole. In one study, sixteen of twenty isolates were sensitive to fluconazole, while four were resistant. It has been hypothesized that &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; possesses the ability to rapidly develop resistance to fluconazole, especially in patients on long-term therapy.

<text>Dulah Marie Evans, later Dulah Marie Evans Krehbiel (17 February 1875 – 24 July 1951) was an American painter, photographer, printmaker, illustrator, and etcher.

Evans received commissions from the Armour Food Company and Santa Fe Railroad to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to photograph Native American subjects in their daily routine and performing ritualistic dances.

==Early life==
On February 17, 1875, Dulah Marie Llan Evans was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa. Her parents were builder and architect David Evans (1825 – 1897) and Marie Ogg Evans (1845 – 1897). Her father was born in Wales, and her mother immigrated to the United States from Switzerland. She had an older brother and sister, and a younger brother as well. Her sister was Mayetta Evans, a playwright and art dealer in Chicago.

==Education==
Evans attended William Penn University and in 1896 began her studies at The Art Institute of Chicago, where she studied under John Vanderpoel and Frederick Richardson and subsequently graduated. While a student at The Art Institute, Dulah spent her summers in Saugatuck, Michigan, studying under John Christen Johansen and other prominent artists. She completed her postgraduate work at the Art Students League in New York City, where she won many first place awards in illustration classes under the instruction of Walter Appleton Clark. She also studied under Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and at the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase in American Impressionism.

==Early career==

This was the &#x27;Golden Age of Illustration&#x27; (1865–1917) and Dulah was part of it. She held a place in the prestigious Tree Studio building in Chicago from 1903 through 1905 along with other well-known painters such as Pauline Palmer, Walter Marshall Clute, Louis Betts, and sculptor Julia Bracken Wendt, with whom she developed a close friendship. During these years, Dulah was working as an illustrator and freelance commercial artist, creating images for the covers of magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;.

Dulah also accepted commissions from the Armour Food Company and Santa Fe Railroad, both headquartered in Chicago at the time. These commissions often took Dulah to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to photograph Native American subjects in their daily routine and performing ritualistic dances. Many of Dulah&#x27;s Southwest photographs would be used in later years as the subjects for her paintings, woodcuts, lithographs, and etchings. She completed a series of three paintings related to The Deer Dance of the Tesuque Indians in 1905.

==Marriage==
Dulah left the Tree Studio in 1906 to marry Albert Henry Krehbiel (1873 – 1945), a classmate from The Art Institute of Chicago. Albert was awarded an American Traveling Scholarship from the Art Institute in 1903 and, having spent three years studying at Académie Julian in Paris and traveling and painting throughout Europe, had accepted a teaching position at the Institute upon his return in May 1906. In 1907, Albert reduced his schedule to teaching summer sessions only and undertook the awarded commission to design and paint the eleven wall and two ceiling murals for the Illinois Supreme Court Building in the state capitol of Springfield (the murals were completed in 1911). Dulah was Albert&#x27;s only assistant, performing the duties of designing costumes, modeling, and conducting research on material pertinent to the theme of the murals. As with many husband and wife artists of the time, Dulah and Albert frequently painted together and often painted the same subject. They each had a high regard for the other&#x27;s work and Albert, unlike many men of his day, was proud of his wife&#x27;s artistic career and success.

From 1910 through 1915, Dulah worked out of her new &quot;Ridge Crafts Studio&quot; in Park Ridge, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago where she and Albert had purchased a large home. Here, she created a line of exclusively designed cards and folders for all occasions. Most of these cards were hand-colored engraved images, while others were hand-colored lithographs. A sample sales book of these cards is now in the collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. Dulah&#x27;s assistants, appropriately called the &quot;Ridge Craft Girls&quot;, often pulled double duty as models for both Dulah&#x27;s and Albert&#x27;s paintings. However, no individual was asked to pose more than their son and only child, Evans Llan Krehbiel, born in 1914. One of Dulah&#x27;s first paintings of Evans, appropriately titled &quot;Baby Krehbiel&quot; (1915, 22&quot; x 30&quot;, oil on canvas), was featured in the Chicago Daily Herald on March 14, 1915.

During these early years in Park Ridge, Dulah and Albert were part of the &quot;Park Ridge Art colony&quot;. Founded by members of the faculty of the Art Institute, the colony&#x27;s objective was to create a society that would work for the encouragement of artistic culture. As was stated in an article in The Chicago Evening Post (July 6, 1912);

&quot; . . . All intend to support the new association, which will expend its energies in public school art, and co-operate with the other clubs, while going its own way in search of culture.&quot;

Among the other distinguished members of the &quot;Park Ridge Art Colony&quot; were founding painters Frederick Richardson, James William Pattison, Louis Betts, and Walter Marshall Clute, and sculptor John Paulding.

==Career==

===California===
From 1917 through 1920, Dulah (traveling with Albert, Evans, and her sister, journalist and playwright Mayetta Evans) spent summers painting in California at the &quot;Santa Monica Art colony&quot;. Dulah&#x27;s friend and fellow Tree Studio artist, Julia Bracken, had married painter William Wendt in 1906 and moved to Los Angeles, becoming one of the city&#x27;s foremost sculptors. By 1918, William Wendt had built a studio at Laguna Beach and California Impressionism was in full swing. Dulah&#x27;s many paintings of her son and sister posing along the beach reflected this style. One such work, &quot;Santa Monica Bay&quot; (1920, 17&quot; x 21&quot;, oil on canvas), was exhibited at the Arts Club of Chicago in 1923, where Dulah was a founding member.

Dulah would return to Santa Monica many times, often after having spent the initial summer months at the &quot;Art colony of Santa Fe&quot; in New Mexico, which was started by Alice Corbin Henderson, editor of the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot;, and wife of Indian motif painter William Penhallow Henderson. In 1927, Dulah visited fellow artist Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt at his studio in Santa Fe, where she and her sister bought ten of his paintings. On this trip, Dulah took photographs of the studios of several Taos artists, including those of Ernest Blumenschein, painter and one of the founders of the Taos Society of Artists, and painter Gerald Cassidy, as well as photographs of the home of Mabel Dodge Luhan. (A wealthy heiress from New York, Mabel Dodge Luhan transformed Taos, New Mexico, into an artist colony in the 1920s and 30s by inviting such noted artists as Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and D. H. Lawrence to join her in the town&#x27;s idyllic setting, which she considered to be the center for cultural and spiritual salvation.)

It was in California that Dulah began painting in the modernist style. She created works that were more introspective in nature and which had spiritual overtones. Dulah became interested in the organization of multiple figures, often using groupings of three (perhaps to reveal a spiritual synthesis) in surrealistic mountain landscapes. She produced different tensions with each canvas by the placement of subject figures in positions juxtaposed to their rocky surroundings. One such work, &quot;Mountain Pass&quot; (September 1920, 23&quot; x 24&quot;, oil on canvas), was exhibited at the Chicago Arts Club in 1927. Dulah created her first etchings relating to the Southwest in 1927. Her Southwest prints were sold in the Albert Roullier Galleries in Chicago and were often featured in Chicago newspapers and magazines. In 1930, Dulah left Park Ridge for New York City, where she was successful in establishing a market for her artwork at the &quot;Salons of America&quot; and the &quot;Society of Independent Artists&quot;.

===Studio Place===
Returning to her Park Ridge home and her studio (now called &quot;Studio Place&quot;) in 1932, Dulah persevered in creating her ethereal landscapes throughout the decade and beyond. From the early 1920s through the 1940s, she exhibited at the Arts Club of Chicago with other well-known artists, including painter Pauline Palmer and Bauhaus photographer László Moholy-Nagy, and at The Art Institute of Chicago with painters Gerald Cassidy, Jessie Willcox Smith, Edgar Payne, and J. Alden Weir. As if to reflect the diversity of her art, throughout her career Dulah signed her works as Dulah Marie Evans, Dulah Llan Evans, and as Dulah Evans Krehbiel.

The Park Ridge Modernist, as Dulah had become known, died at the age of 76 on July 24, 1951, in Evanston, Illinois. Dulah&#x27;s impressionistic work, &quot;Three Ladies at an Open Window&quot; (August 1920, 14&quot; x 17&quot;, oil on canvas) was selected in 2001 for the permanent collection of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.

<text>Kenneth Louis Gaburo (July 5, 1926 – January 26, 1993) was an American composer.

==Life==
Gaburo was born in Somerville, New Jersey. He served as a professor of music at the University of Illinois, the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Iowa. His notable students include Louise Spizizen, James Tenney, Betty Ann Wong, and Allen Strange. He is renowned as a teacher, pioneer of electronics in music, jazz pianist, writer, ecologist, publisher, and proponent of compositional linguistics.

In 1968, he joined the faculty at the new San Diego campus of the University of California where in 1972 a Rockefeller Foundation grant enabled him to start NMCE IV, this time with an actor, a virtuoso speaker, a mime, a gymnast, and a sound-movement artist. Until his resignation from UCSD in 1975 he produced a large number of integrated theatrical works, such as the collection &quot;Lingua and Privacy&quot;.

In 1975, Gaburo founded Lingua Press, which produces scores, books, records, audio tapes, videotapes, and films. This firm is dedicated to putting forth unique artist-produced works in all media having to do with language and music. Many of the publications have been exhibited in book art shows throughout the world. Gaburo lived in the Anzo-Borrego desert writing and teaching from 1980 until 1983. In 1980, he was artistic director for the first &quot;authentic&quot; production of Harry Partch&#x27;s &quot;The Bewitched&quot; for the Berlin Festival (recorded on &quot;Enclosure Five: Harry Partch&quot;, innova 405). His understanding of Partch&#x27;s concept of corporeality has deep connections with his own concern for physicality and how it informs compositions. His 1982 tape work, &quot;RE-RUN&quot;, for instance, was generated after a 20-hour sensory deprivation exercise.

He became Director of the Experimental Music Studio at the University of Iowa in 1983. The studio put intensive focus on composition, technology, psycho-acoustic perception, performance, and the affirmation of the uniqueness of the individual to create his/her own language reality. At the studio, he founded the Seminar for Cognitive Studies, a forum for discussion of the creative process. His concern for the investigation of music as legitimate research, and composition as the creation of intrinsic appropriate language, led to a series of readings in compositional linguistics for solo performer. One such piece is &quot;PENTAGON/Y&quot; (1986) was published in The Act.

He most often made innovative use of electronics and explored tonality, serialism, and what he called &quot;compositional linguistics&quot; such as in his LINGUA series. He also wrote minimal pieces such as &quot;The Flow of (u)&quot; for three voices singing unison.

Gaburo died in 1993 in Iowa City, Iowa, aged 66.

<text>Houthem is a village in the Dutch province of Limburg. It is a part of the municipality of Valkenburg aan de Geul, and lies about 8 km east of Maastricht.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1096 as &quot;apud Houlten&quot;, and means &quot;settlement in a deciduous forest&quot;. Houthem is a village which developed in the Middle Ages in the valley of the Geul. Since 1232, it belonged to the . In 1201, a Premonstratensian monastery was founded near the grave of Saint Gerlach. Between 1661 until 1785, the walled monastery was an Austrian enclave in the Dutch Republic.

The Catholic St Gerlachus Church used to be the main building of the nunnery. The church was destroyed in 1574, but 13th century elements remain. Between 1720 and 1727, the building was renovated and enlarged. In 1786, the nuns left and the building was auctioned in 1797. In 1808, part of the vault collapsed and the building was restored as a church. The church contains the tomb of Saint Gerlach.

Houthem was home to 659 people in 1840. In 1888, Houthem-Sint Gerlach railway station opened on the Aachen to Maastricht railway line.

Houthem was a separate municipality until 1940, when it was merged with Valkenburg. In 1982, it became part of the municipality of Valkenburg aan de Geul.

<text>The Advent Christian Church, also known as the Advent Christian General Conference (ACGC), is a &quot;first-day&quot; body of Adventist Christians founded on the teachings of William Miller in 1860. The organization&#x27;s Executive Director is Reverend Justin Nash, and its President is Reverend John Gallagher. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the functions of its central offices include global missions, leadership development, church planting and management of organizational publications and media. These ministries are under the leadership of the organization&#x27;s Executive Director, Rev. Justin Nash, who is accountable to the organization&#x27;s executive council. This council, a governing board made up of elected representatives from Advent Christian Churches, is chaired by the organization&#x27;s president, Rev. John Gallagher. In addition to the work of the central offices, more localized work is done in five regions of the U.S. and Canada under the direction of five regional superintendents, as well as in several state conference bodies and in 30 countries around the world. The organization holds to a congregational structure, in which each of its member churches and their members has input into the overall direction of the organization.

==Early history==
===William Miller===

The first Advent Christian Association was founded in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1860. The church&#x27;s formation is rooted in the Adventist teachings begun by Baptist preacher William Miller of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. For many years, Miller studied the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament, especially the book of Daniel, and the book of Revelation from the New Testament. After many calculations, he announced in 1831 that the Second Advent would occur in 1844. Thousands of people believed him and sold their possessions. His followers, called Millerites, waited for the coming of Christ and the end of the world and were greatly disappointed when his predictions proved incorrect.

===Jonathan Cummings===
Jonathan Cummings (1817–1894), a disciple of Miller who reset Miller&#x27;s prediction of Christ&#x27;s coming to 1854, also influenced individuals who founded the Advent Christian Association. A third root of the Advent Christians is found in the rise of the doctrine of conditional immortality among Adventist preachers such as Charles F. Hudson (1795–1881) and George Storrs (1796–1879). Rejecting what they believed was a component of Greek philosophy (immortality of the soul), they taught that though man was created for immortality, that immortality had been forfeited in the fall of Adam. They believed that only the redeemed would receive eternal life; the dead unconsciously would await the resurrection and final judgement. At the time of judgement, the wicked would suffer extinction. These teachings separated them from some within the Millerite movement.

==Beliefs==
===Statement of faith===
The Advent Christian statement of faith is as follows:

===Declaration of principles===
The Advent Christian declaration of principles is as follows:

#We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, being in its entirety a revelation given to man under divine inspiration and providence; that its historic statements are correct, and that it is the only divine and infallible standard of faith and practice.
#We believe, as revealed in the Bible:
##In one God, our Father, eternal, and infinite in his wisdom, love, and power, the Creator of all things, &quot;in whom we live, and move, and have our being.&quot;
##And in Jesus Christ, our Lord, the only begotten Son of God, conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary; who came into our world to seek and to save that which was lost; who died for our sins; who was raised bodily from the dead for our justification; who ascended in heaven as our High Priest and Mediator, and who will come again in the end of this age, to judge the living and the dead, and to reign forever and ever.
##And in the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, sent from God to convince the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment, whereby we are sanctified and sealed unto the day of redemption.
#We believe that man was created for immortality, but that through sin he forfeited his divine birthright; that because of sin, death entered into the world, and passed upon all men; and that only through faith in Jesus Christ, the divinely ordained Life-giver, can men become &quot;partakers of the divine nature,&quot; and live forever.
#We believe that death is a condition of unconsciousness to all persons, righteous and wicked; a condition which will remain unchanged until the resurrection at Christ&#x27;s Second Coming, at which time the righteous will receive everlasting life while the wicked will be &quot;punished with everlasting destruction;&quot; suffering complete extinction of being.
#We believe that salvation is free to all those who, in this life and in this age, accept it on the conditions imposed, which conditions are simple and inflexible, namely, turning from sin, repentance toward God, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and a life of consecration to the service of God; thus excluding all hope of a future probation, or of universal salvation.
#We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his promise, will come again to this earth, even &quot;in like manner&quot; as he went into heaven - personally, visibly and gloriously - to reign here forever; and that this coming is the hope of the church, inasmuch as upon that coming depend the resurrection and reward of the righteous, the abolition of sin and its consequences, and the renewal of the earth - now marred by sin - to become the eternal home of the redeemed, after which event the earth will be forever free from sin and death.
#We believe that Bible prophecy has indicated the approximate time of Christ&#x27;s return, and comparing its testimony with the signs of our times, we are confident that he is near, &quot;even at the doors,&quot; and we believe that the great duty of the hour is the proclamation of this soon-coming redemption, the defense of Bible authority, inspiration and truth, and the salvation of lost men.
#We believe the church of Christ is an institution of divine origin, which includes all true Christians, of whatever name; but that local church organizations should be independent of outside control, congregational in government, and subject to no dictation of priest, bishop or pope - although true fellowship and unity of action should exist between all such organizations.
#We believe that the only ordinances of the church of Christ are Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper; immersion being the only true baptism.
#We believe that the first day of the week, as the day set apart by the early church in commemoration of Christ&#x27;s resurrection, should be observed as the Christian Sabbath, and used as a day of rest and religious worship.
#We believe that war is contrary to the spirit and teachings of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ; that it is contrary to the spirit of true brotherhood; and that our influence should be used against it. We believe the Bible also teaches that properly constituted government is ordained by God and is a divine instrument for man&#x27;s welfare and protection. When an Advent Christian decides on the basis of Scripture and conscience, either to bear arms or to submit to penalties imposed for his refusal to do so, local Advent Christian congregations should extend continued fellowship and nurture.

==Statistics==
In 2006, the Advent Christian Church had about 25,600 members in 293 churches across the United States─a number not radically different from the 28,300 it had in 1925, with relatively stable membership during the intervening years. The largest concentration of churches is along the eastern coast of the United States, where they have a strong concentration of churches in most states. Additionally, they claim approximately 100,000 members internationally, spread out over work in 30 countries.

==Memberships and partnerships==
The Advent Christian Church is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals and the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. They also have working partnerships with several other evangelical ministries.

<doc id="409591" wikidata="Q313377" url="?curid=409591" title="Thomas Harris">
<text>William Thomas Harris III (born September 22, 1940) is an American writer. He is the author of a series of suspense novels about Hannibal Lecter. The majority of his works have been adapted into films and television, including &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, which became only the third film in Academy Awards history to sweep the Oscars in all of the five major categories.

His novels have sold more than 50 million copies, with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; alone selling 10 million copies, as of 2019.

==Biography==
Harris was born in Jackson, Tennessee, but moved as a child with his family to Rich, Mississippi. He was introverted and bookish in grade school and then blossomed in high school. He attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he majored in English and graduated in 1964. While in college, he worked as a reporter for the local newspaper, the &quot;Waco Tribune-Herald&quot;, covering the police beat. In 1968, he moved to New York City to work for the Associated Press until 1974 when he began work on his debut novel, &quot;Black Sunday&quot;.

==Personal life==
Harris avoids publicity and conducted few interviews between 1976 and 2019. At Baylor University, he met and married Harriet Anne Haley, a fellow student, in June 1961. They had one daughter, Elizabeth Anne, before they divorced in August 1968. Harris remained close to his mother Polly and called her every night no matter where he was. He often discussed particular scenes from his novels with her. Polly died on December 31, 2011.

Harris lives in South Florida and has a summer home in Sag Harbor, New York. His long-term domestic partner is Pace Barnes, a woman who, according to &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;used to work in publishing and is as outgoing as he is quiet&quot;. Harris&#x27; friend and literary agent Morton Janklow said of him: &quot;He&#x27;s one of the good guys. He is big, bearded and wonderfully jovial. If you met him, you would think he was a choirmaster. He loves cooking—he&#x27;s done the Le Cordon Bleu exams—and it&#x27;s great fun to sit with him in the kitchen while he prepares a meal and see that he&#x27;s as happy as a clam. He has these old-fashioned manners, a courtliness you associate with the South.&quot; 

In his first major interview in 43 years, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2019 to promote &quot;Cari Mora&quot;, he revealed himself to be a nature lover, and a long-time visitor and volunteer of the Pelican Harbor Seabird Station, an animal rescue center in Miami, Florida, for 20 years. The staff were not aware of who Harris was until a few years prior to when the interview was conducted. He described fame as &quot;more of a nuisance than anything else&quot;.

==Approach to writing and critical reception==
&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; came out to a very positive critical reception. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it thus: &quot;&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; stands alone in being, I personally believe, the only FBI-centred novel worth reading.&quot; The long-awaited &quot;Hannibal&quot; received high praise from Stephen King, but John Lanchester claimed that it had a &quot;sense of discontinuity&quot;.

Harris has described his own writing process as difficult, &quot;almost passive.&quot; Fellow novelist Stephen King remarked that if writing is sometimes tedious for other authors, to Harris it is like &quot;writhing on the floor in agonies of frustration&quot;, because for Harris, &quot;the very act of writing is a kind of torment&quot;. Novelist John Dunning said of Harris, &quot;All he is is a talent of the first rank.&quot; In 2019, Harris elaborated on his process, as well as the difficulty, describing it thus: &quot;...sometimes you really have to shove and grunt and sweat. Some days you go to your office and you&#x27;re the only one who shows up, none of the characters show up, and you sit there by yourself, feeling like an idiot. And some days everybody shows up ready to work. You have to show up at your office every day. If an idea comes by, you want to be there to get it in.&quot;

<text>Paul Panhuysen (21 August 1934 – 29 January 2015) was a Dutch composer, visual and sound artist. He founded and directed Het Apollohuis, an art space that functioned during the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s having artists doing sound installations, sound sculptures, and concerts about free improvisation, experimental music, and electronic music.

== Personal life ==
Panhuysen was born in Borgharen. He first followed Monumental and Autonomous Art Studies at the Jan van Eyck Academy in Maastricht (1954–1959), and then followed Sociology of Art Studies at the University of Utrecht (1957–1961). Defined as artist, musician, curator, art sociologist and art theoretician, his artistic interests were first inclined towards Abstract Expressionism (until 1964), Minimal art (until 1966) and then Performance art (until nowadays).

Panhuysen’s production is greatly multifaceted though the goal remains contributing to improve the daily life of people. Marked by this social motivation, he organised several events such as the “Road Block” in Veendam (1970) to allow children to play safely at the street. In addition to this, he became Director of the Art School Vredeman de Vries, Leeuwarden (1962–1964) with a focus on raising the quality of education. The social recognition of his work was manifested with the prizes Mention of Honnor, Prix Europe de peinture, Oostende (1962) and Frisiana Award, Leeuwarden (1963), as well as with the job appointments at the Municipal Museum The Hague as member of educational staff (1966) and at the Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven in charge of the Educational and Public Relations Department (1966–1967).
Social engagement and experimental art were developed under several ways. Panhuysen founded the &quot;&quot; (&quot;De Bende van de Blauwe Hand&quot;) (from 1965), and organized the &quot;Museumfeest&quot; (&quot;Museumparty&quot;, 1967) at the Van Abbemuseum with a record of 1,200 visitors. Then he set up the “Free Community of the Global City of Peace and Pleasure” (1967-8), and the “Maciunas Ensemble” (1968-), and from 1980 until 2001 he founded and directed the aforementioned Het Apollohuis, in Eindhoven.

He was a member of the Board of the Federation of Artists Associations (BBK), and founder of the artists unions: OBK and VBBKZN (1969–1981). As an artist-in-residence, he has stayed at the Exploratorium, San Francisco, USA (1993), at the Yellow Springs Institute, Chester Springs, USA (1994), and at the Aomori Contemporary Art Centre, Aomori, Japan (2002). The artist has lately received the Noord-Brabant Cultural Award (1996), Award best exhibition, Galerie Klatovy/Klenová (2000) and Honorary Mention, Prix Ars Electronica, Linz (2004). Paul Panhuysen was invested Companion of the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 1998.

The most known sound installations of this artist were made with strings, crossing the spaces in different ways, and later played by the artist putting rosing in his fingers and using them as a sort of violin bow.

He has released several albums, including:
*Paul Panhuysen and the Galvanos: &quot;Lost for Words&quot;, in which various recordings are input into several galvanometers, attached to which are metal springs which vibrate more readily at some frequencies over others, and these frequencies are then reamplified.
*Paul Panhuysen: &quot;Partitas for Long Strings&quot;, which is from the long string installations which Panhuysen has been doing for quite a while.

Maciunas Ensemble, named after George Maciunas of Fluxus fame, was an ensemble founded in 1968 by Paul Panhuysen, Remko Scha and Jan van Riet. Scha left the ensemble in 1982. In 2012 a set of eleven CDs was released of the early years. He has also worked with Arnold Dreyblatt and Ellen Fullman.

Panhuysen died on 29 January 2015 at the age of 80.

<doc id="409593" wikidata="Q5006750" url="?curid=409593" title="C. P. Scott">
<text>Charles Prestwich Scott (26 October 1846 – 1 January 1932), usually cited as C. P. Scott, was a British journalist, publisher and politician. Born in Bath, Somerset, he was the editor of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; (now &quot;The Guardian&quot;) from 1872 until 1929 and its owner from 1907 until his death. He was also a Liberal Member of Parliament and pursued a progressive liberal agenda in the pages of the newspaper.

==Biography==

===Early years===
He was the fourth son of the businessman Russell Scott and his wife Isabella Civil Prestwich, born at Bath, Somerset. He was educated at Hove House and Clapham Grammar School. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1865, taking a first in Greats and graduating B.A. in 1869.

Scott in 1870 went to Edinburgh to train on &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. While at Oxford, his cousin John Taylor, who ran the London office of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, decided that the paper needed an editor based in Manchester and offered Scott the post. Scott already enjoyed a familial connection with the paper; its founder, John Edward Taylor, was his uncle, and at the time of his birth Scott&#x27;s father, Russell Scott, was the paper&#x27;s owner, though he later sold it back to Taylor&#x27;s sons under the terms of Taylor&#x27;s will. Accepting the offer, Scott joined the paper as their London editor in February 1871 and became its editor on 1 January 1872.

As editor Scott initially maintained &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;&#x27;s well-established moderate Liberal line, &quot;to the right of the party, to the right, indeed, of much of its own special reporting&quot;. However, when in 1886 the whigs led by Lord Hartington and a few radicals led by Joseph Chamberlain, split the party, formed the Liberal Unionist Party and gave their backing to the Conservatives, Scott&#x27;s &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; swung to the left and helped Gladstone lead the party towards support for Irish Home Rule and ultimately the &quot;new liberalism&quot;.

===Parliamentary career===

In 1886, Scott fought his first general election as a Liberal candidate, an unsuccessful attempt in the Manchester North East constituency; he stood again for the same seat in 1891 and 1892. He was elected at the 1895 election as MP for Leigh, and thereafter spent long periods away in London during the parliamentary session. His combined position as a Liberal backbencher, the editor of an important Liberal newspaper, and the president of the Manchester Liberal Federation made him an influential figure in Liberal circles, albeit in the middle of a long period of opposition. He was re-elected at the 1900 election despite the unpopular stand against the Boer War that the &quot;Guardian&quot; had taken, but retired from Parliament at the time of the Liberal landslide victory in 1906, when he was occupied with the difficult process of becoming owner of the newspaper he edited.

===Taking ownership of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;===
In 1905, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;&#x27;s owner, Edward Taylor, died. His will provided that the trustees of his estate should give Scott first refusal on the copyright of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; at £10,000, and recommended that they should offer him the offices and printing works of the paper on &quot;moderate and reasonable terms&quot;. However, they were not required to sell it at all, and could continue to run the paper themselves &quot;on the same lines and in the same spirit as heretofore&quot;. Furthermore, one of the trustees was a nephew of Taylor and would financially benefit from forcing up the price at which Scott could buy the paper, and another was &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;&#x27;s manager, but faced losing his job if Scott took control. Scott was therefore forced to dig deep to buy the paper: he paid a total of £240,000, taking large loans from his sisters and from Taylor&#x27;s widow (who had been his chief supporter among the trustees) to do so. Taylor&#x27;s other paper, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, was inherited by his nephews in the Allen family. Scott made an agreement to buy the &quot;MEN&quot; in 1922 and gained full control of it in 1929.

===His politics and relations with Government===
While in London, he stayed at the central location of Nottingham Place from where he could gather news intelligence on European developments. Would the government declare war? Scott recorded that the German ambassador had been deceived into believing that Britain would stay outside the conflict. But liberal policy always accentuated one of &quot;continuity&quot; of free radicals at its heart. But for Scott the Cabinet remained too reticent to act, too timid, clearly an indication of his movement towards MacDonald and Labour. They espoused a pacifist position in Britain, which he was warned was &quot;pro-German&quot;. He was a friend of the radical Charles Hobhouse MP, who was not in the War Cabinet.

Scott turned his paper into a pacifist weapon against entering the war, and he lobbied the cabinet as well. His leaders denounced a &quot;conspiracy to drag us into a war against England&#x27;s interests&quot;, arguing that it would amount to a &quot;crime against Europe&quot; and warning that it would &quot;throw away the accumulated progress of half a century&quot;. On Tuesday, 4 August 1914 – the day the king declared war – David Lloyd George told Scott, &quot;Up until last Sunday only two members of the Cabinet had been in favour of our intervention in the war but the violation of Belgian territory had completely altered the situation&quot;.

Although a lifelong liberal, Scott had a troubled relationship with Lloyd George. Perhaps most instructive of his communicating skills was the introduction he made of Chaim Weizmann to Lloyd George. He struck up a remarkable friendship with the Jewish émigré, whose intellectual brilliance and business savvy was lately attracting the attention of even the Tory Press and senior ministers. Scott wrote regularly in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; dealing frankly and openly with the Samuel Memorandum; they would all come together in Downing Street for a top-level summit on the Palestine Question. But Scott also investigated Sir Roger Casement. His story was linked to Michael Collins&#x27; Dublin builder Batt O&#x27;Connor, who more than any Irishman had served to hide Collins&#x27;s presence from the RIC. In Ulster Joe Devlin warned the Left of the impending violence should they not heed the warnings contained in the newspapers about the coming military occupation. The Curragh incident had profoundly shocked the establishment in Ireland; on 27 July 1916 Scott would hold just a one-off meeting with General Macready, Lord Reading and Lloyd George in the aftermath of the Easter Rising.

Scott was gregarious and frequently met at the Reform Club and with his left-wing friends at the Bath Club. His membership involved serious friendships with other editors, including G. Lowes Dickinson, but his closest political intimate was Irish leader John Dillon. They shared a socialist ambition for home rule, pacifism, conscriptionism and feminism.

===Senior political journalist===
Under his stewardship the &quot;Guardian&quot; continued to grow with Lloyd George&#x27;s influence overseeing its place at the top table. In one such famous interview the new Prime Minister gave his &quot;fight to the finish&quot; speech. Scott was responsible for recruiting the correspondent Robert Dell whose role in Paris was to communicate on secret negotiations with the Quai D&#x27;Orsay and &quot;Bureau Anglais&quot; in a weekly column called &quot;From Our Correspondent, Paris, Friday&quot;. Despite Lloyd George&#x27;s objection to the reporter&#x27;s anonymity there remained little chance of compromising their French colleagues in a city already renowned for prostitution. To the contrary, Thomas Spring Rice his friend suggested that it had &quot;a most excellent effect here.&quot; Scott became friendly with Churchill, a Liberal, and dined with Lord Fisher but remained essentially anti-Conservative. Nonetheless the War Office acknowledged the utility of civilians as contacts on the ground; Scott&#x27;s opinion was solicited on anything from the strength of Irish war opinions to whether Churchill should be removed from office.

===Views===
In a 1921 essay marking the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;&#x27;s centenary (at which time he had served nearly fifty years as editor), Scott put down his opinions on the role of the newspaper. He argued that the &quot;primary office&quot; of a newspaper is accurate news reporting, saying &quot;comment is free, but facts are sacred&quot;. Even editorial comment has its responsibilities: &quot;It is well to be frank; it is even better to be fair&quot;. A newspaper should have a &quot;soul of its own&quot;, with staff motivated by a &quot;common ideal&quot;: although the business side of a newspaper must be competent, if it becomes dominant the paper will face &quot;distressing consequences&quot;.

While supporting female suffrage, Scott was hostile to militant suffragettes in his editorials, accusing them of employing &#x27;every engine of misguided fanaticism in order to wreck, if it be in their power, the fair prospects of their cause&#x27; He was just as disturbed by the General Strike of 1926, asking &#x27;Will not the General Strike cease to be counted henceforth as a possible or legitimate weapon of industrial warfare&#x27; Irish rebels were authors of their own destruction, he thought. On the execution of Padraig Pearse and James Connolly after the Easter Uprising in Dublin, he wrote that &#x27;it is a fate which they invoked and of which they probably would not complain&#x27;.

Scott was a supporter of Zionism.

===Final years===
Scott remained editor of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; until 1 July 1929, at which time he was eighty-three years old and had been editor for exactly fifty-seven and a half years. His successor as editor was his youngest son, Ted Scott, though C. P. remained as Governing Director of the company and was at the &quot;Guardian&quot; offices most evenings. He died in the early hours of New Year&#x27;s Day 1932.

===Family===
In 1874, Scott married Rachel Cook, who had been one of the first undergraduates of the College for Women, Hitchin (later Girton College, Cambridge). She died in the midst of the dispute over Taylor&#x27;s will. Their daughter Madeline married long-time &quot;Guardian&quot; contributor Charles Edward Montague. Scott&#x27;s eldest son Laurence died in 1908, aged 31, after contracting tuberculosis. His middle son John became the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;″s manager and founder of the Scott Trust. Youngest son Ted, who succeeded his father as editor, drowned in a sailing accident after less than three years in the post. John and Ted Scott jointly inherited the ownership of the Manchester Guardian &amp; Evening News Ltd.; after Ted&#x27;s death John passed it on to the Scott Trust.

In 1882, having built a new house in Darley Dale in Derbyshire, Sir Joseph Whitworth leased The Firs in Fallowfield in Manchester to his friend C. P. Scott. After Scott&#x27;s death the house became the property of the University of Manchester, and was the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s residence until 1991. Scott used to travel into his Cross Street office by bicycle.

Scott was the grandfather of Evelyn Montague (1900–1948), the Olympic athlete and journalist depicted in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. Montague, like his grandfather, wrote for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, and became its London editor.

==Honours==
Scott was made a Freeman of the City of Manchester in 1930.

<doc id="409595" wikidata="Q188720" url="?curid=409595" title="Michael Laudrup">
<text>Michael Laudrup (, born 15 June 1964) is a Danish professional football coach and former player. Renowned for his composure, passing, vision, technical skills, ball control, and dribbling ability, Laudrup is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time. He is the older brother of fellow retired footballer Brian Laudrup.

During his playing career, Laudrup won league titles with Ajax, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other attacking positions. In a period where Laudrup was recognized as one of the best football players of his generation, he became a key member of Johan Cruyff&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;. At Barcelona, Laudrup claimed nine trophies in total, including four successive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the European Cup in 1992, as he moved to arch-rivals Real Madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth consecutive La Liga title.

Laudrup made his debut for the Denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. He starred in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and from November 1994, he captained Denmark for a total of 28 matches, including the victorious 1995 Confederations Cup tournament. He played alongside his brother Brian in the Denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.

In 1999, Laudrup was voted the Best Foreign Player in Spanish Football over the preceding 25-year period and in April 2000 he was knighted, receiving the Order of the Dannebrog. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Denmark by the Danish Football Union, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. He was officially named the best Danish footballer of all time by the Danish Football Union (DBU) in November 2006. He was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players at a FIFA awards ceremony in 2004. In April 2013, he was named by &quot;Marca&quot; readers in the &quot;Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid&#x27;s history&quot;.

On 16 October 2021, at a show celebrating the National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark&#x27;s 125th anniversary, 125 candidates for the title of the greatest ever Danish sports star had been reduced to eight, and Laudrup was named the winner.

After retiring as a player, Laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the Denmark national team. He got his first manager job at former club Brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 Danish Superliga championship. He chose not to extend his contract with Brøndby in May 2006. He took over as coach of Getafe and had notable success there. He brought the club comparative success in the Copa del Rey and UEFA Cup, and the team&#x27;s attacking style received plaudits. On 15 June 2012, Laudrup was appointed the manager of Premier League club Swansea City on a two-year contract. In his first season in south Wales, he won the League Cup, the first major English trophy in Swansea&#x27;s 100-year history. On 4 February 2014, he was sacked by Swansea after a &quot;significant&quot; slump in the Premier League, leaving them two points above the relegation zone. Laudrup then managed Qatari clubs Lekhwiya and Al Rayyan between 2014 and 2018.

==Club career==
Born in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Michael Laudrup began playing football in father Finn Laudrup&#x27;s childhood club Vanløse. When Finn Laudrup became player/coach of Brøndby in 1973, the family moved to Brøndby and both Michael and his brother Brian Laudrup started playing for the club as well. Michael followed his father to the top-flight Danish 1st Division club KB in 1976, while Brian remained at Brøndby.

===Early career===
Laudrup made his senior debut playing for KB in 1981, and made his debut for the Danish under-19 national team in February 1981. In all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. He went back to play for Brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of Brøndby to the 1st Division.

At Brøndby, Laudrup scored two goals in the club&#x27;s 1st Division debut game, as fellow promoted team B 1909 were beaten 7–1. He scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st Division. His accomplishments earned him the 1982 Danish Player of the Year award. He played part of the 1983 season for Brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending Serie A champions Juventus from Italy in June 1983. It was the biggest transfer deal in Danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. He was due to sign for Liverpool the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, Liverpool proposed a four-year contract and Laudrup opted not to sign.

===Lazio===

Under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had Polish midfielder Zbigniew Boniek and Michel Platini, Juventus initially lent Laudrup to newly promoted Rome club Lazio for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for Juventus. With Lazio, he scored two goals in his Serie A debut, a 2–4 loss to Hellas Verona. In his first year at Lazio, Lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as Juventus wanted to keep Boniek and Platini, he stayed for another year. Lazio started the 1984–85 season poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to Serie B. Laudrup scored just one goal that season.

===Juventus===

Laudrup returned to Juventus in summer 1985 to replace Zbigniew Boniek, playing alongside Michel Platini. In his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 Serie A as well as the Intercontinental Cup trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out; he was once again named Danish Player of the Year in 1985. However, the following season was not a success for Laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries. When Platini retired in 1987, Laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought Welsh forward Ian Rush. But Laudrup failed to live up to Platini&#x27;s standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season.

===Barcelona===
After an unsuccessful season with Juventus, Laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in Italy. In 1989, he joined Spanish club Barcelona on the premise that Dutch coach Johan Cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. Immediately, Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff&#x27;s leadership, citing the Dutchman&#x27;s philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside Dutch defender Ronald Koeman and Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov, who were the pillars of the &quot;Barça&quot; &quot;Dream Team&quot;, along with rising stars Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero and Txiki Begiristain.

The Dream Team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s Ajax team, and won four consecutive La Liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 European Cup, along with the 1992 UEFA Super Cup, 1989–90 Copa del Rey and 1991 and 1992 Supercopa de España titles. Laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years. When &quot;Barça&quot; hired a fourth foreign star player, Brazilian striker Romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0–4 loss to Milan (amid conflicts with Cruyff), his time at Barcelona was effectively over. After the match, Milan&#x27;s manager Fabio Capello remarked: &quot;Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake.&quot;

Laudrup&#x27;s departure from Barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Pep Guardiola was reportedly so upset by the news that he cried and begged Laudrup to change his mind. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, Laudrup commented: &quot;I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with AC Milan in that period.&quot;

===Real Madrid===
In 1994, Laudrup completed a controversial move from &quot;Barça&quot; to Real Madrid after he fell out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. It was the year after the 1994 FIFA World Cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.

Despite widespread belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in an attempt to &quot;get back&quot; at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said: &quot;People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I&#x27;ve had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at Barcelona]. I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. I said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.&quot; On 5 November 1994, he assisted Raúl&#x27;s first professional goal in a 4–2 win over Atlético Madrid

Laudrup went on to guide Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the &quot;Barça&quot; stranglehold, making him on record the only player to win the Spanish league five consecutive seasons playing for two different clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre club season would follow. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. The following season while playing for Real Madrid, he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave &quot;Barça&quot;, the final score also ending 5–0. Daniel Storey wrote of Laudrup, &quot;no other player is loved on both sides of the clásico divide quite like Laudrup&quot; as he remains held in high regard by both Barça and Madrid fans. Following the match, Laudrup&#x27;s former Barcelona manager Cruyff commented: &quot;When Michael plays like a dream, a magic illusion, determined to show his new team his extreme abilities, no one in the world comes anywhere near his level.&quot;

===Later career and retirement===
In 1996, Laudrup left Real Madrid to play for Vissel Kobe in Japan. On 18 August 1996, he played his first match for Vissel Kobe and scored two goals in a 4–2 win against Brummell Sendai. On 15 September 1996, he recorded three assists, including his first assist for Vissel Kobe in a 5–1 victory against Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo. He helped Vissel to promotion from the second-tier Japan Football League to the J1 League.

He was registered as a player in Bosnian Premier League club Čelik Zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for Čelik, but was signed as a player. After the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at Dutch side Ajax in 1998.

Following his retirement, Laudrup sometimes turned out to play for Lyngby&#x27;s Old Boys team in his spare time.

==International career==
Laudrup was called up for the Denmark national team during Brøndby&#x27;s debut season in the top-flight. On his 18th birthday on 15 June 1982, he became the then-second-youngest Danish national team player ever, following Harald Nielsen. Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio, Laudrup starred for the Denmark national team at UEFA Euro 1984, playing all four of Denmark&#x27;s matches.

Laudrup participated in the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of Uruguay. He was also a part of the disappointing Denmark squad at Euro 1988, though Laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of Denmark&#x27;s two goals.

Following three matches in the qualification campaign for Euro 1992, Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 (alongside his brother Brian Laudrup and Jan Mølby) following differences with coach Richard Møller Nielsen. The Danes originally failed to qualify but were later given Yugoslavia&#x27;s place as Yugoslavia were disqualified due to war in their country. Notwithstanding their qualification, Laudrup rated Denmark&#x27;s chances of success so low he stayed on holiday. However, Denmark caused one of the biggest upsets in football history by going on to win the tournament, beating holders the Netherlands in the semi-final and, in the final beating reigning world champions and favourites Germany, with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort.

Laudrup returned to Nielsen&#x27;s Danish squad in August 1993, but saw Spain and the Republic of Ireland qualify for the 1994 World Cup ahead of Denmark. He scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against Argentina, as Denmark won the 1995 Intercontinental Cup. He also scored four goals in ten matches as Denmark qualified for Euro 1996.

Laudrup&#x27;s last matches for Denmark came at the 1998 World Cup, when he captained the nation to the quarterfinal. Laudrup made his 100th appearance for Denmark in the team&#x27;s opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of Saudi Arabia in Lens. On 24 June, he scored a goal in a 1-2 defeat to France. On 28 June, Laudrup provided two assists in a 4–1 win over the Nigeria in the round of 16. Denmark was defeated 2–3 by Brazil in the quarter-finals, and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination. Both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both Michael and Brian were named in FIFA&#x27;s All-Star Team.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
A quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, Laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. Although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth, or even as a forward or striker on rarer instances; he was also used as a centre-forward on occasion under his Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff, a role which was similar to that of the modern false 9 role, as well as the free centre-forward role in which Cruyff often operated throughout his playing career. Laudrup is considered by many in the sport as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever.

Regarding Laudrup&#x27;s vision and passing ability, his brother Brian stated in 2008: &quot;My brother started as an attacker but became an elegant attacking midfielder, perhaps the most complete there has ever been. His vision, speed of thought and passing were on a different level; he always knew what was going to happen before anybody else did. If anyone had a &#x27;football brain&#x27;, it was him.&quot; Despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot, and was capable of scoring goals as well as creating them.

Nicknamed &quot;The Prince of Denmark,&quot; throughout his career, Laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, ball control, and dribbling ability, as well as his vision, ability to read the game, and range of passing, including deep passes, through balls, and crosses, which made him an excellent assist provider. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, &quot;[He] has eyes everywhere.&quot; His trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career.

The Laudrup dribble, a signature feint also known as the &quot;croqueta&quot;, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender, a move which was later also popularised by later Barcelona midfielder Andrés Iniesta. Laudrup&#x27;s ball skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. This led to the expression &quot;Made in Laudrup&quot; being coined in the Spanish football media, which was widely used in Spain to describe his trademark assists, in particular his lobbed passes, as well as his unique play. According to a 2018 article by Josh Butler of &quot;The Athletic&quot; and &quot;These Football Times&quot;, several of Laudrup&#x27;s teammates said of his creative style of play: &quot;Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.&quot;

===Reception===
Throughout his career, Laudrup was often ranked among the best players in the world, with the French three-time European footballer of the year award winner Michel Platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. In a 2006 interview, Laudrup&#x27;s Real Madrid teammate Raúl called him the best player he had ever played with, a view echoed by his Barcelona teammate Romário, who opined that he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fourth-best player in the history of the game (behind Pelé, Diego Maradona and himself). Luís Figo instead labelled Laudrup as arguably the best opponent he had ever faced. Ronald Koeman rated Laudrup as &quot;possibly the most skillful and elegant player [he] ever played with,&quot; adding: &quot;Few could dribble like he could. He could sense when a game was ready to be seized and transformed by a moment of individual brilliance.&quot; Roberto Galia stated in 2008: &quot;I have played against Maradona, Platini and Baggio. But the player I saw do the most indescribable things was Michael Laudrup.&quot; Former teammate Guillermo Amor said: &quot;I have never seen a better player in one-on-ones. He was our special player.&quot; Diego Maradona stated: &quot;Michael is one of the greatest. If you ask if there is a new Maradona, you also have to ask if there is a new Laudrup. The answer is no.&quot;

Thierry Henry named Laudrup as the best player he had never played with, saying he did not know any better passer than him and &quot;the world of football did not give him the credit that guy [Laudrup] deserved.&quot; John Toshack ranked Laudrup as &quot;the best player of his generation,&quot; likening him to Cruyff both as a player and a manager, a view shared by Franz Beckenbauer, who dubbed Laudrup the best player of the 90s. Javier Clemente once stated: &quot;To me, Michael Laudrup is the most genius player the world has ever seen. He will always be my numero uno. Always.&quot; José Mari Bakero instead remarked: &quot;No one has given the club [Barcelona] as much inspiration as Michael. We all look up to him. It is a privilege to have your day enriched by a genius.&quot; In 2012, Ian Rush described him as &quot;an incredible player,&quot; who &quot;probably had the most individual skill&quot; he had ever seen. Daniel Storey of &quot;Planet Football&quot; stated in 2020 that he believed that Laudrup was one of the most underrated players of the previous 30 years, a view shared by Albert Ferrer, who stated in 2009: &quot;Few people made me enjoy the game as much as Michael. Maybe he didn&#x27;t get the media recognition he deserved, but he was so classy and a real thinker. A master of the blind pass and impossible through-balls and I will never forget his &#x27;spoon&#x27; pass in a game against Osasuna. He lifted the ball right over the defence and Romario touched it in first time.&quot;

At Barcelona, Laudrup played alongside Hristo Stoichkov, who scored many goals from Laudrup&#x27;s passes. Regarding Laudrup&#x27;s ability to create chances for his teammates, he commented in his 2008 autobiography: &quot;From more than hundred goals that I scored I&#x27;m sure that over 50 were assisted by Michael. To play with him was extremely easy. We found each other by intuition on the field and found common football language. Look at Iván Zamorano. Laudrup went there [Real] and Zamorano is a goalscorer. Sometimes I envy Ivan for the passes he receives. Passes on foot after you accelerated. Few people understand football like the Danish player. He can only be compared with Maradona, Schuster or Roberto Baggio. They make things easy and find the right solutions. For them [it] is simple, for the opponent – unthinkable. Phenomenal! His only problem is his character. He is emotional and terribly reserved. This affects him a lot, because he takes everything personally – no matter if someone tells him something or decision that he does not agree. His relations with Cruyff were delicate because he couldn&#x27;t take the critics. I listen to him but I don&#x27;t care that much. For Michael this was fatal. He couldn&#x27;t take it anymore so he left without a word.&quot; That same year, in an interview with &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;, Stoichkov included Laudrup in his &quot;Perfect XI,&quot; and labelled him as: &quot;One of the best European players I&#x27;ve ever seen,&quot; and as a player who was &quot;up there with the greats.&quot; He went on to describe him as: &quot;An elegant, old-fashioned playmaker,&quot; who &quot;did things few other footballers could do.&quot; In 2010, he instead said that &quot;Laudrup was the greatest.&quot;

Another striker who benefitted from Laudrup&#x27;s playmaking abilities was Real Madrid teammate Iván Zamorano, who called Laudrup &quot;El Genio&quot; (&quot;The Genius,&quot; in Spanish) during Laudrup&#x27;s time in the Spanish capital. Zamorano was going through a hard spell in Madrid, but when Laudrup arrived to assist his goals, Zamorano immediately became the top goalscorer of La Liga, winning the &quot;pichichi&quot; trophy; Zamorano himself credited Laudrup for his role in his increased goalscoring output, describing him as a &quot;genius,&quot; while also commenting: &quot;...The reason why I make so many goals is Laudrup.&quot; He also stated: &quot;Michael was a magician and one of the greatest players ever. He was amazing in one-on-ones too. I always say that Laudrup had three eyes, not two like everyone else. As a forward, I had to be aware all the time, because he could make you a chance out of nothing and you had to be prepared for that moment.&quot; Andrés Iniesta, who became known for using Laudrup&#x27;s signature dribbling move – the &quot;croqueta&quot; – rated Laudrup as the greatest player of all time.

Throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. However, despite his talent and reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned Laudrup&#x27;s work rate, mentality, determination, and consistency throughout his career at times, in particular in his early career. His former Juventus teammate and admirer Michel Platini, for example, once said, &quot;[Laudrup]&#x27;s the greatest player in the world, in training,&quot; also describing him as &quot;one of the biggest talents ever,&quot; while also lamenting that he &quot;never used his talent to its fullest during matches.&quot; His former Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff described him as &quot;One of the most difficult players [he had] worked with,&quot; adding: &quot;When he gives 80–90% he is still by far the best, but I want 100%, and he rarely does that.&quot; In 1998, he stated: &quot;Had Michael been born in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being his only way out of poverty he would today be recognised as the biggest genius of the game ever. He had all the abilities to reach it but lacked this ghetto-instinct, which could have driven him there.&quot; At Swansea in 2012, Alan Tate commented: &quot;He is still the best player in training at [age] 48 years.&quot; This was echoed by Swansea player Danny Graham: &quot;Laudrup was the best player in training by a mile. It was unreal.&quot; In addition to his playing ability, Laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career.

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
After his playing career ended with Ajax, Laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the Denmark national team head coach Morten Olsen in 2000. The national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. Together, they led Denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 World Cup.

===Brøndby===
After his success as Denmark assistant manager, Laudrup signed on as manager for Danish Superliga club Brøndby. As his assistant coach, he paired up with former Danish championship winning manager John Jensen, who had played alongside him in the Denmark national team. At the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which Olsen and he had coached at the national team. He renovated the Brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club&#x27;s youth scheme.

To ensure the defensive strength of the team, Laudrup signed proven national team player Morten Wieghorst. He began his reign as Brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 Danish Supercup. In his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the Danish Cup, after Brøndby beat Midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the Danish Superliga. Laudrup&#x27;s success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year.

In the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place Copenhagen by just one point. However, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the Danish Superliga title. In the same season, he also completed The Double after he won his second Danish Cup in four seasons. This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award. After finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 Danish Superliga, Laudrup announced that he, along with assistant Faxe Jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. The pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left Brøndby in June 2006.

Laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club Real Madrid and that he would replace Lars Lagerbäck as head coach of the Sweden national team.

In 2007, Brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium &quot;The Michael Laudrup Lounge&quot;, with Laudrup&#x27;s approval. His success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year.

===Getafe===
On 21 June 2007, Laudrup was linked to a move to Madrid-based La Liga club Getafe by sports newspaper &quot;Marca&quot;. This was confirmed on 9 July 2007. During his stay in Getafe, the club reached the final of the Copa del Rey, losing to Valencia, and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, losing in extra time to Bayern Munich. During his tenure as successor to Bernd Schuster, he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club, bringing back memories of Laudrup as a player. His team, which was not one of the established powers in Spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. However, he spent only one season as manager, resigning in May 2008.

After Laudrup announced his departure from Getafe, he was linked with jobs at Barcelona, Valencia, Benfica, Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers, Panathinaikos, CSKA Moscow and West Ham United. He almost got the job at Panathinaikos, but according to Danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a Spanish club. This request was not accepted by the Greeks, who chose to hire Henk ten Cate instead.

===Spartak Moscow===
On 12 September 2008, it was officially announced that Laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage Spartak Moscow, replacing Stanislav Cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results. However, Laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. He was subsequently sacked on 15 April 2009, just seven months on the job, in the wake of Spartak&#x27;s quarter-final 3–0 loss to Dynamo Moscow in the Russian Cup. The official statement from Spartak read: &quot;From this point onwards, head coach Michael Laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results.&quot;

On 22 October 2009, Spanish media announced Laudrup would be appointed as new manager of Spanish side Atlético Madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of Abel Resino, following Atlético&#x27;s 4–0 UEFA Champions League group stage defeat to Chelsea. However, Laudrup and Atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. The day after, on 23 October, Resino was sacked and Quique Sánchez Flores was appointed as coach as the side&#x27;s second-choice.

===Mallorca===
In July 2010, Laudrup was appointed manager of Mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of June 2012. In his first season, he kept the struggling Mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the UEFA Europa League due to its poor financial situation. At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 September 2011, Laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, Erik Larsen. Laudrup cited great frustration with Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the club&#x27;s director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.

===Swansea City===
On 15 June 2012, Laudrup was appointed manager of Swansea City on a two-year contract, becoming the first Dane to manage in the Premier League. He made several new signings after arriving at the Liberty Stadium, including Michu, Chico Flores, Pablo Hernández, Jonathan de Guzmán and Ki Sung-yueng. His first competitive match as Swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at Loftus Road against Queens Park Rangers.

At Swansea, Alan Tate said that Laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. He has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with Michu, who scored 22 goals in 2012 for Swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from Rayo Vallecano. On 23 January 2013, he led Swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning European champions Chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the League Cup semi-finals.

On 7 February 2013, Laudrup appointed former Danish international midfielder Morten Wieghorst as his assistant, after previously signing him as a player when Laudrup was managing Brøndby. Laudrup would later say he &quot;certainly&quot; believes Wieghorst &quot;can be manager&quot; of Swansea, as &quot;he has experience from Scottish football and is familiar with English football&quot;. On 24 February, Laudrup said he had no &quot;ambition to become the manager&quot; of a big club, because he could not &quot;have done everything for 10 years&quot; in management and then be fired &quot;after nine months&quot; for not winning any trophies. He also said it gave him &quot;much more pleasure to see how well&quot; he could do where he did not &quot;have to win all the time&quot;.

On 24 February 2013, Laudrup won his first trophy with Swansea after his side beat Bradford City 5–0 to win the Football League Cup at Wembley. This was also Swansea&#x27;s first major trophy in English football in the club&#x27;s history.

Following Swansea&#x27;s 1–0 win over Newcastle United on 2 March 2013 the club moved into eighth position in the top-half of the Premier League table, seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left; Laudrup said he wanted Swansea to finish eighth, stating that &quot;coming eighth [will be] like winning the league&quot; for the club because he felt &quot;the first seven spots&quot; were already taken by Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton. On 3 March, though he had said that his &quot;intention&quot; was &quot;to stay&quot; in south Wales for the next year, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said that the club were in the &quot;process of looking for the next manager&quot; of the club, in case Laudrup did choose to leave the club.

On 8 March 2013, Laudrup signed a new contract with Swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. Reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause Brendan Rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the Liberty Stadium four months prior to joining Liverpool. On 10 May, however, he confirmed that his &quot;intention&quot; was to stay at Swansea &quot;next season,&quot; saying that reports he wanted to leave Wales was &quot;pure speculation.&quot;

On 4 February 2014, Laudrup was sacked by Swansea following a poor run of form, which left the club two points clear of relegation. At the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.

===Lekhwiya===
On 30 June 2014, Laudrup became the new manager of Qatar Stars League champions Lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. He guided the Lekhwiya to a club-record Qatar Stars League and a Crown Prince Cup double in his first season. The club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 AFC Champions League during his reign. On 17 June 2015, Laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.

===Al Rayyan===
On 3 October 2016, Laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of Al Rayyan on a two-year contract, replacing Jorge Fossati. His first match in charge was on 15 October 2016, when Al Rayyan faced Al Sailiya in an away match in the league, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw.

==Style of management and tactics==

As assistant manager to Morten Olsen, the Denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. Laudrup learnt from Olsen and used the same tactical style with Brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. He continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined Getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the Copa del Rey final. However, at Spartak Moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the Russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals &quot;per&quot; match.

As Mallorca manager, Laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. In 2012, he joined Swansea City as manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers. Under Rodgers, Swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. Under Laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing, possession, and pressing game. He also signed a number of new players, primarily from La Liga, trying to bring the attacking style from Spain to Wales, which saw more goals scored. He said, &quot;You can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in Spain right now.&quot;

Laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the League Cup, after beating Bradford City a record 5–0 in the final. &quot;You can&#x27;t ask players to do things that Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are doing, but you can ask the easy things,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. That, everybody can learn.&quot;

==Outside of football==
===Personal life===
Michael Laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. His uncle was former Brøndby and Aberdeen manager Ebbe Skovdahl. He is the son of former Danish national team player Finn Laudrup. From his marriage with his first wife, Tina Thunø, Laudrup has a son, Mads. Mads has been the team captain of various Danish youth national teams since January 2005. Today, he is married with Siw Retz Laudrup, with whom he has two children, Andreas and Rebecca. Andreas was selected a part of the under-16 national team in March 2006.

Michael Laudrup has a younger brother, Brian Laudrup, who was also a footballer. Brian Laudrup is the record holder of Danish player of the year awards with four, and was rated by FIFA as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992. Brian Laudrup was in the Euro 1992 Team of the Tournament and World Cup 98 Team of the Tournament. Brian was also known for his part in the Rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s. Brian was a part of the trophy-winning Danish national team at UEFA Euro 1992, but Michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach Richard Møller Nielsen. In 2004, both the Laudrup brothers were named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by Pelé as part of the celebration of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

===Politics and business===
Alongside his professional football career, Laudrup began importing Spanish wine to Denmark in 1993. Initially, the wine import was sort of a hobby, but business grew rapidly and today his company, Laudrup Vin og Gastronomi, has over ten employees, runs a Wine Academy and imports wines from all over the world.

In 2004, Laudrup was one of the founders of CEPOS, a Danish classical liberal/free-market conservative think-tank.

<text>Rudolf Franz Ferdinand Höss (also Höß, Hoeß, or Hoess; ; 25 November 1901 – 16 April 1947) was a German SS officer and the commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of World War II, he was convicted in Poland and executed for war crimes committed on the prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp and for his role in the Holocaust.

Höss was the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz Concentration Camp (from 4 May 1940 to November 1943, and again from 8 May 1944 to 18 January 1945). He tested and implemented means to accelerate Hitler&#x27;s order to systematically exterminate the Jewish population of Nazi-occupied Europe, known as the Final Solution. On the initiative of one of his subordinates, Karl Fritzsch, Höss introduced the pesticide Zyklon B to be used in gas chambers, where more than a million people were killed.

Höss was hanged in 1947 following a trial before the Polish Supreme National Tribunal. During his imprisonment, at the request of the Polish authorities, Höss wrote his memoirs, released in English under the title &quot;Commandant of Auschwitz: The Autobiography of Rudolf Hoess&quot;.

==Early life==
Höss was born in Baden-Baden into a strict Catholic family. He lived with his parents, Lina (&quot;née&quot; Speck) and Franz Xaver Höss. Höss was the eldest of three children and the only son. He was baptized Rudolf Franz Ferdinand on 11 December 1901. Höss was a lonely child with no companions of his own age until he entered elementary school; all of his associations were with adults. Höss claimed in his autobiography that he was briefly abducted by Romanies in his youth. Franz was a former army officer who served in German East Africa, ran a tea and coffee business. He brought his son up on strict religious principles and with military discipline, having decided that he would enter the priesthood. Höss grew up with an almost fanatical belief in the central role of duty in a moral life. During his early years, there was a constant emphasis on sin, guilt, and the need to do penance.

==Youth and World War I==
Höss began turning against religion in his early teens after an episode in which, he said, his priest broke the Seal of the Confessional by telling his father about an event at school wherein Höss had pushed another boy down the stairs, causing him to break his foot. He also felt betrayed by his father, because he had used the information against him. Höss had described this event during his confession. Soon afterward, Höss&#x27; father died, and Höss began moving toward a military life.

When World War I began, Höss briefly served in a military hospital and then, at the age of 14, he was admitted to his father&#x27;s and his grandfather&#x27;s old regiment, the 21st Regiment of Dragoons. When Höss was 15, he and the Ottoman Sixth Army fought at Baghdad, at Kut-el-Amara, as well as in Palestine. While stationed in the Ottoman Empire, Höss rose to the rank of &quot;&quot; (sergeant-in-chief), and at 17 was the youngest non-commissioned officer in the army. Wounded thrice and a victim of malaria, Höss was awarded the Iron Crescent, the Iron Cross first and second class, and other decorations. Höss also briefly commanded a cavalry unit. When the news of the armistice reached Damascus, where he was serving at that time, Höss and a few others decided not to wait for Allied forces to capture them as prisoners of war. Instead, they decided to attempt to travel all the way back to their homeland of Bavaria. This attempt forced them to traverse through the enemy territory of Romania, but they eventually reached Bavaria.

==Joining the Nazi Party==

After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, Höss completed his secondary education and soon joined some of the emerging nationalist paramilitary groups, first the East Prussian Volunteer Corps, and then the Freikorps &quot;Rossbach&quot; in the Baltic area, Silesia and the Ruhr. Höss participated in the armed terror attacks on Polish people during the Silesian uprisings against the Germans, and on French nationals during the French Occupation of the Ruhr. After hearing a speech by Adolf Hitler in Munich, Höss joined the Nazi Party in 1922 (member number 3240) and renounced affiliation with the Catholic Church.

On 31 May 1923, in Mecklenburg, Höss and members of the Freikorps attacked and beat to death local schoolteacher Walther Kadow on the wishes of farm supervisor Martin Bormann, who later became Hitler&#x27;s private secretary. Kadow was believed to have tipped off the French occupational authorities that Freikorps paramilitary soldier Albert Leo Schlageter was carrying out sabotage operations against French supply lines. Schlageter was arrested and executed on 26 May 1923; soon afterwards Höss and several accomplices, including Bormann, took their revenge on Kadow. In 1923, after one of the killers confessed to a local newspaper, Höss was arrested and tried as the ringleader. Although he later claimed that another man was actually in charge, Höss accepted the blame as the group&#x27;s leader. He was convicted and sentenced (on 15 or 17 March 1924) to 10 years in prison, while Bormann received a one-year sentence.
Höss served out his prison sentence in the Brandenburg penitentiary. Due to his exemplary behavior while an inmate there, he gained privileges such as the light in his cell being kept on after 10 PM lights out, being allowed to write letters to relatives every two weeks, and a job in the prison&#x27;s administration. These privileges were in part due to him being considered a &quot;delinquent motivated by conviction&quot; (offender whose motives had been on moral political or religious grounds) and partly because of prison officials who sympathized with Höss’ cause and his political views.

Höss was released from prison in July 1928 as part of a general amnesty and joined the Artaman League, an anti-urbanization movement, or back-to-the-land movement, that promoted a farm-based lifestyle. On 17 August 1929, he married Hedwig Hensel (3 March 1908 – 15 September 1989), whom he met in the Artaman League. Between 1930 and 1943, they had five children: two sons (Klaus and Hans-Jürgen) and three daughters (Heidetraut, Inge-Brigitt, and Annegret). Klaus, Höss&#x27; eldest son, was born in 1930; Heidetraut, Höss&#x27; eldest daughter, was born in 1932; Inge-Brigitt was born on a farm in Pommern in 1933; Hans-Jürgen, Höss&#x27; younger son, was born in 1937; and Annegret, the youngest child, was born at Auschwitz in November 1943.

During this time, Höss worked and lived at a farm in Sallentin, whose owner wanted to establish a horse stable, and his experience with horses from being in the cavalry in World War I gave him the necessary experience to do so. Höss would later join the cavalry squadron of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; on September 30, 1933, and become a &quot;SS-Anwärter&quot;. 

It was during this time that Höss was noticed by Heinrich Himmler during an inspection of the SS in Stettin. They also were previously acquainted (according to Höss) from their Artaman League days, although other sources claim they knew each other from Höss&#x27; involvement in the Nazi party in the 1920s.

==SS career==
On 1 April 1934, Höss joined the SS, on Himmler&#x27;s effective call-to-action, and in the same year moved to the Death&#x27;s Head Units. Höss was assigned to the Dachau concentration camp in December 1934, where he held the post of Block leader. His mentor at Dachau was the then SS-brigadier general Theodor Eicke, the reorganizer of the Nazi concentration camp system. In 1938, Höss was promoted to SS-captain and was made adjutant to Hermann Baranowski in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. There he led the firing squad that, on Himmler&#x27;s orders on 15 September 1939, killed August Dickmann, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness who was the first conscientious objector to be executed after the start of the War. Höss fired the finishing shot from his pistol. He joined the Waffen-SS in 1939 after the invasion of Poland. Höss excelled in that capacity and was recommended by his superiors for further responsibility and promotion. By the end of his tour of duty there, Höss was serving as administrator of prisoners&#x27; property. On 18 January 1940, as head of the protective custody camp at Sachsenhausen, Höss ordered all prisoners not assigned to work details to stand outside in frigid conditions reaching . Most of the inmates had no coats or gloves. When block elders dragged some of the frozen inmates to the infirmary, Höss ordered the infirmary doors to be closed. During the day, 78 inmates died; another 67 died that night.

===Auschwitz command===

Höss was dispatched to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a concentration camp in western Poland, a territory Germany had incorporated into the province of Upper Silesia. His favorable report led to the creation of the Auschwitz camps and his appointment as commandant. The camp was built around an old Austro-Hungarian (and later Polish) army barracks near the town of Oświęcim; its German name was Auschwitz. Höss commanded the camp for three and a half years, during which he expanded the original facility into a sprawling complex known as Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Höss had been ordered &quot;to create a transition camp for ten thousand prisoners from the existing complex of well-preserved buildings,&quot; and he went to Auschwitz determined &quot;to do things differently&quot; and develop a more efficient camp than those at Dachau and Sachsenhausen, where he had previously served. Höss lived at Auschwitz in a villa with his wife and five children.

The earliest inmates at Auschwitz were Soviet prisoners-of-war and Polish prisoners including peasants and intellectuals. Some 700 arrived in June 1940, and were told they would not survive more than three months. At its peak, Auschwitz comprised three separate facilities: Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau and Auschwitz III-Monowitz. These included many satellite sub-camps, and the entire camp complex was built on about that had been cleared of all inhabitants. Auschwitz I was the administrative centre for the complex; Auschwitz II Birkenau was the extermination camp where most of the murders were committed; and Auschwitz III Monowitz was the slave-labour camp for I.G. Farbenindustrie AG, and later other German industries. The main purpose of Monowitz was the production of a form of synthetic rubber called &quot;buna&quot; &amp; synthetic oil.

Most infamous at Auschwitz I, the original camp, was Block 11 and the courtyard between Blocks 10 and 11. High stone walls and a massive wooden gate shielded Nazi brutality from observers. Condemned prisoners were led from Block 11, naked and bound, to the Death Wall at the back of the courtyard. A member of the Political Department then shot the prisoners in the back of the head, using a small-caliber pistol to minimize noise. As punishment, Höss also employed standing cells in Block 11. On many occasions, he condemned 10 random prisoners to death by starvation in a Block 11 cell in retaliation for the escape of one inmate.

===Mass murder===

In June 1941, according to Höss&#x27;s trial testimony, he was summoned to Berlin for a meeting with Himmler &quot;to receive personal orders&quot;. Himmler told Höss that Hitler had given the order for the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. According to Höss, Himmler had selected Auschwitz for the extermination of Europe&#x27;s Jews &quot;on account of its easy access by rail and also because the extensive site offered space for measures ensuring isolation&quot;. Himmler described the project as a &quot;secret Reich matter&quot; and told Höss not to speak about it with &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Richard Glücks, head of the Nazi camp system run by the Death&#x27;s Head Unit. Höss said that &quot;no one was allowed to speak about these matters with any person and that everyone promised upon his life to keep the utmost secrecy.&quot; He told his wife about the camp&#x27;s purpose only at the end of 1942, since she already knew about it from Fritz Bracht. Himmler told Höss that he would be receiving all operational orders from Adolf Eichmann, who arrived at the camp four weeks later.

Höss began testing and perfecting techniques of mass murder on 3 September 1941. His experiments led to Auschwitz becoming the most efficiently murderous instrument of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; and the Holocaust&#x27;s most potent symbol. According to Höss, during standard camp operations, two or three trains carrying 2,000 prisoners each would arrive daily for four to six weeks. The prisoners were unloaded in the Birkenau camp and subjected to &quot;selection&quot;, usually by a member of the SS medical staff. Men were separated from women, and only those deemed suitable for Nazi slave labor were allowed to live. The elderly, infirm, children, and mothers with children were sent directly to the gas chambers. Those found fit for labor were marched to barracks in either Birkenau or one of the Auschwitz camps, stripped naked, shorn of all hair, sprayed with disinfectant, and tattooed with a prisoner number. At first, small gassing bunkers were located deep in the woods to avoid detection. Later, four large gas chambers and crematoria were constructed in Birkenau to make the killing process more efficient, and to handle the sheer volume of victims.

Höss experimented with various gassing methods. According to Eichmann&#x27;s trial testimony in 1961, Höss told him that he used cotton filters soaked in sulfuric acid for early killings. Höss later introduced hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), produced from the pesticide Zyklon B, to the process of extermination, after his deputy Karl Fritzsch had tested it on a group of Russian prisoners in 1941. With Zyklon B, he said that it took three to 15 minutes for the victims to die and that &quot;we knew when the people were dead because they stopped screaming.&quot; In an interview at Nuremberg after the war, Höss commented that after observing the prisoners die by Zyklon B, &quot; ...this gassing set my mind at rest for the mass extermination of the Jews was to start soon.&quot;

In 1942, Höss began a forced sexual relationship with an Austrian communist political prisoner at Auschwitz, Eleonore Hodys (or Nora Mattaliano-Hodys). She became pregnant and was imprisoned in a standing-only arrest cell. Released from the cell, she had an abortion in a camp hospital in 1943 and, according to her later testimony, just barely evaded being selected to be killed. These events and corruption rumours may have led to Höss&#x27; temporary recall from the Auschwitz command in 1943. The level of corruption at Auschwitz had reached such a high level that, in the autumn of 1943, Lieutenant Konrad Morgen and his assistant Wiebeck were tasked with investigating both the embezzlements taking place in the camp and Höss&#x27; illegal relationship. Morgen interviewed Hodys and Höss and intended to proceed against Höss, but the case was dismissed. Morgen, Wiebeck and Hodys gave testimony after the war.

After being replaced as the Auschwitz commander by Arthur Liebehenschel, on 10 November 1943, Höss assumed Liebehenschel&#x27;s former position as the head of &quot;Amt D I&quot; in &quot;Amtsgruppe D&quot; of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (WVHA); he also was appointed deputy of the inspector of the concentration camps under Richard Glücks.

=== Operation Höss ===
On 8 May 1944, Höss returned to Auschwitz to supervise Operation Höss, in which 430,000 Hungarian Jews were transported to the camp and killed in 56 days. Even Höss&#x27; expanded facility could not handle the huge number of victims&#x27; corpses, and the camp staff were obliged to dispose of thousands of bodies by burning them in open pits. In May and June alone, almost 10,000 Jews were being gassed per day. Because the number of people exceeded the capacity of the gas chambers and crematoria, mass pit executions were established. Jews were forced to undress, then led to a hidden fire pit by Sonderkommando where they were shot by the SS, then thrown into the flames.

===Ravensbrück===
Höss&#x27; final posting was at Ravensbrück concentration camp. He moved there in November 1944 with his family who lived close by. After the completion of the gas chamber, Höss coordinated the operations of killing by gassing, with a death toll of more than 2,000 female prisoners.

==Fall of the Third Reich==
In April 1945, Höss and his family went to Darss, together with Richard Glücks, before continuing to Schleswig-Holstein. In the traveling party was the wife of Theodor Eicke, her daughter, and several other families belonging to prominent Nazis. Höss had been tasked with keeping them out of enemy hands. During their escape, they learned about the death of Hitler.

Höss and his wife were downcast at the news that their Führer was dead. Since Höss had procured poison for his family, in case they were captured by the Russians, they considered the idea of suicide together with their children, like the Goebbels family and other Germans previously had done:

Instead, Hedwig and the children were taken to the home of the children&#x27;s old governess, who lived at Michaelisdonn, while Höss and his son Klaus continued on alone.

==Arrest, trial, and execution==

In the final days of the war, Himmler advised Höss to disguise himself as a member of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Adopting the pseudonym &quot;Franz Lang&quot; and working as a gardener, Höss lived in Gottrupel, Schleswig-Holstein, with his family and evaded arrest for nearly a year.

In 1946, Hanns Alexander, a German Jew who had fled to England in 1936, becoming a Nazi hunter working for the British government&#x27;s &quot;No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team&quot;, managed to uncover Höss&#x27; location. Alexander, who was then a captain in the Royal Pioneer Corps, travelled to Höss&#x27; residence with a group of British soldiers, many of whom were also Jewish. Alexander&#x27;s men unsuccessfully interrogated Höss&#x27; daughter Brigitte for information; according to Brigitte, the soldiers subsequently started to beat her brother Klaus, leading Höss&#x27; wife to give up his location. According to Alexander, Höss attempted to bite into a cyanide pill once he was discovered by the soldiers. Höss initially denied his identity: 

On 15 April 1946, Höss testified at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, where he gave a detailed accounting of his crimes. Höss was called as a defense witness by Ernst Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s lawyer, . The transcript of Höss&#x27; testimony was later entered as evidence during the 4th Nuremberg Military Tribunal, known as the Pohl Trial for principal defendant Oswald Pohl. Affidavits that Höss made while imprisoned in Nuremberg were also used at the Pohl and IG Farben trials.

In his affidavit made at Nuremberg on 5 April 1946, Höss stated:

On 25 May 1946, Höss was handed over to Polish authorities, and the Supreme National Tribunal in Poland tried him for murder. In his essay on the Final Solution in Auschwitz, which Höss wrote in Kraków, he revised the previously given death toll:

In his memoir, Höss also claimed to have suffered mistreatment at the hands of his British captors and to have signed the transcript of his first interrogation under duress.

Höss&#x27; trial lasted from 11 to 29 March 1947 and he was sentenced to death by hanging on 2 April. The sentence was carried out two weeks later on 16 April beside the crematorium of the former Auschwitz I concentration camp. He was hanged on a short-drop gallows constructed specifically for that purpose, at the location of the camp&#x27;s Gestapo. The message on the board that marks the site reads:

Höss wrote his autobiography while awaiting execution; it was first published in a Polish translation in 1951 and then in the original German in 1956, edited by Martin Broszat. It later appeared in various English editions and consists of two parts, one about his own life and the second about other SS men with whom he had become acquainted, mainly Heinrich Himmler and Theodor Eicke, among several others. Höss blamed his subordinates and kapos, prisoner functionaries, for the mistreatment of prisoners. He claimed that, despite his best efforts, Höss was unable to stop the abuse. He also stated that he was never cruel and never mistreated any inmate. Höss blamed Hitler and Himmler for using their powers &quot;wrongly and even criminally&quot;. Höss saw himself as &quot;a cog in the wheel of the great extermination machine created by the Third Reich&quot;.

After discussions with Höss during the Nuremberg trials at which he testified, the American military psychologist Gustave Gilbert wrote the following:

Four days before being executed, Höss&#x27; acknowledgement of the enormity of his crimes was revealed in a message to the state prosecutor:
Shortly before his execution, Höss returned to the Catholic Church. On 10 April 1947, he received the sacrament of penance from Fr. , S.J., provincial of the Polish Province of the Society of Jesus. The next day, the same priest administered to him Holy Communion as Viaticum.

On 16 April 1947, Höss was hanged. At the request of former camp prisoners, the execution was carried out in Auschwitz, the camp he once commanded. Approximately 100 witnesses were present, including former prisoners and various high-ranking officials of the Polish government. Höss&#x27; was the last public execution in Poland.

==Family==
Rudolf Höss married Hedwig Hensel on 17 August 1929. They had five children:

## Klaus Höss: born 6 February 1930, died in Australia in the 1980s.
## Heidetraud Höss: born 9 April 1932, died prior to 2020.
## Inge-Brigitt Höss: born 18 August 1933, died October 2023.
## Hans-Jürgen Höss: born in May 1937.
## Annegret Höss: born 7 November 1943.
In a farewell letter to his wife, Höss wrote on 11 April 1947:
The same day in a farewell letter to his children, Höss told his eldest son:

An inmate who worked as a gardener recalled that Klaus, the eldest son, used to play &quot;...with a pistol, with a carbine and shot straight into the garden. A few times this put us in danger. The child did so out of stupidity, aimed at people and said: &#x27;I&#x27;ll shoot the Polish pig.

According to Janina Szczurek, a Polish woman who worked as a seamstress for the family, the Höss children used to run in the garden and watch the prisoners work. The Höss children once wanted to play and she sewed the oldest son a kapo armband and the other children badges &quot;triangles in different colors&quot; such as worn by the prisoners. As they were running around in the garden, Höss came home, saw what his children were wearing and tore off the badges and ordered the children in the house. Szczurek was not punished but given a warning. 

Hans-Jürgen&#x27;s younger son, Rainer, presented himself as a researcher determined to expose his grandfather&#x27;s crimes. However, Rainer has been accused of trading on his name and defrauding the families of Holocaust victims for financial gain. Rainer has reportedly been criminally convicted 13 times, most recently for fraud in August 2020. Hans-Jürgen&#x27;s eldest son, Kai-Uwe, an evangelical pastor, who had previously kept out of the public eye, said, &quot;I just want him [Rainer] to stop defrauding people using the names and ashes of millions of Holocaust victims.&quot;

Inge-Brigitt, also simply known as &quot;Brigitte&quot;, another daughter of the commandant, never read her father&#x27;s memoir, saying it did not interest her and that &quot;the Nazis always get a bad press and no one else does.&quot; Nonetheless, she criticized Rainer&#x27;s actions, saying he had not been born at the time, could thus not know what had happened, and so must be &quot;a lying, drug-addicted, fame-seeking, money-hungry, evil young man&quot;. For a long time, Inge-Brigitt was secretive about her childhood, including to her own children and the press; journalist and writer Thomas Harding (great-nephew of Hanns Alexander, the man who tracked down and arrested Rudolf) had to talk to Inge-Brigitt for three years before she agreed to an interview in 2013, the first interview ever given by one of Rudolf&#x27;s children, in which she described him as the &quot;nicest father in the world.&quot; She acknowledged that what happened in the Auschwitz camp was &quot;very wrong&quot;, and claimed to have been oblivious to the atrocities as a child, knowing only that the camp had prisoners. In a 2021 interview to Harding, her last before her death in 2023, then 88-year old Inge-Brigitt, while condemning the atrocities committed at the Auschwitz camp, seemingly defended her father, stating: &quot;It was not my dad&#x27;s fault. I don&#x27;t think he knew what he got into when he started. Because he was very unhappy many times. And when I talked with my mom after all this happened, you know, she told me he was a very unhappy man.&quot; When Harding voiced his disagreement with Inge-Brigitt&#x27;s characterization, she ultimately reluctantly agreed that Rudolf was responsible.

<text>Overveen is a village in North Holland in the Netherlands, in the municipality of Bloemendaal. Overveen lies on the eastern fringe of the North Sea dunes. To the east it borders the built-up areas of Haarlem. A few kilometres to the west of the town lies the Erebegraafplaats Bloemendaal (Honorary Cemetery), where many Second World War victims have been reburied, including resistance fighter Hannie Schaft, sculptor and resistance leader Gerrit van der Veen, banker and resistance member Walraven van Hall, Physician and former Wehrmacht officer Karl Gröger, and sculptor and resistance member Johan Limpers. The town is connected to rail service by the Overveen railway station which opened in 1881 on the Haarlem to Zandvoort railway line.

<text>William Lawrence Cullen (February 18, 1920 – July 7, 1990) was an American radio and television personality whose career spanned five decades. Known for appearing on game shows and later as a prolific game show host, he hosted 23 shows, earning the nickname &quot;Dean of Game Show Hosts&quot;. Aside from his hosting duties, he appeared as a panelist/celebrity guest on many other game shows, including regular appearances on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

==Early life==
Cullen was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the only child of William and Lillian Cullen. His father was a Ford dealer in Pittsburgh.

He survived a childhood bout with polio that left him with significant physical limitations for the rest of his life. Cullen was a pre-med student at the University of Pittsburgh, but had to withdraw because of financial problems. After he achieved some success in radio, he returned to the university and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Radio==
Cullen&#x27;s broadcasting career began in 1939 in Pittsburgh at WWSW radio, where he worked as a disc jockey and play-by-play announcer or color commentator for Pittsburgh Steelers (NFL) and Pittsburgh Hornets (minor league hockey) games. In 1943, Cullen left WWSW for a brief job at rival station KDKA before leaving Pittsburgh a year later to try his luck in New York. A week after arriving in New York, he was hired as a staff announcer at CBS. 

To supplement his then-meager income, he became a freelance joke writer for some of the top radio stars of the day, including Arthur Godfrey, Danny Kaye, and Jack Benny; he also worked as a staff writer for the &quot;Easy Aces&quot; radio show.

His first venture into game shows was in 1945, when he was hired as announcer for a radio quiz called &quot;Give And Take&quot;. In the summer of 1950, he was quizmaster on &quot;Hit the Jackpot&quot;, the summer replacement for &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; on CBS radio. After a brief stint at WNEW in 1951, he hosted a popular morning show at WNBC radio from 1955 to 1961.

==Military service==
Cullen was a pilot for the United States Army Air Forces in World War II.
Cullen served in the Civil Air Patrol as an instructor and patrol aircraft pilot in his native Pennsylvania during World War II (having failed to qualify for combat duty due to his physical disabilities), and was interested in mechanics.

==TV career==
Cullen&#x27;s first television game show was the TV version of &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, which premiered on NBC in 1952. In 1953, Cullen had &quot;The Bill Cullen Show&quot;, a weekly morning variety program on CBS. He hosted &quot;Bank on the Stars&quot; in 1954. From 1954 to 1955, he hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Place the Face&quot;, a program in which celebrities identified people from their past; he simultaneously hosted CBS&#x27;s &quot;Name That Tune&quot;. From 1956 to 1965, he hosted the initial daytime and primetime versions of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, another Goodson-Todman production. He was also a panelist on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; from 1952 to 1967, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; from 1969 to 1978, where he also guest-hosted on occasion. After relocating to Southern California, Cullen guest-hosted &quot;Password Plus&quot; for four weeks in April 1980 while original host Allen Ludden was being treated for stomach cancer.

Cullen was initially in the running to host the 1972 revival of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, but the physical demands of the new format were deemed too strenuous for him. Consequently, when CBS picked up the daytime version, Bob Barker was selected to host the daytime version while Dennis James (who sold the pilot with Mark Goodson) hosted the syndicated nighttime version. Barker remained the show&#x27;s daytime host until his retirement in 2007. Occasional references to Cullen have been made by current &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; host Drew Carey.

Other game shows Cullen hosted included &quot;Eye Guess&quot; in the 1960s; &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, &quot;Blankety Blanks&quot;, &quot;The Love Experts&quot;, &quot;How Do You Like Your Eggs?&quot; (QUBE cable interactive program) and the syndicated version of &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; in the 1970s; and later in his career &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, &quot;Hot Potato&quot; and &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; (his final hosting job from 1984 to 1986, following the death of Jack Barry).

In a 1984 &quot;TV Guide&quot; article, Cullen commented on the ease with which he seemed to land his hosting jobs:

 &quot;This is how it happens every time,&quot; says Cullen. &quot;A known packager comes up with the idea for a new show. The network says, do a run-through. They do. The network likes it, and they say, we&#x27;ll give you a pilot. Then the network says, Who are we going to get to host it?

Packager: Who do you have in mind?

Network: Let&#x27;s go with someone new.

Packager: Great idea. Who?

Network: Don&#x27;t you know anybody?

Packager: No. There&#x27;s so-and-so, but we tried him in a run-through and he didn&#x27;t work out ... How about you? You know someone?

Network: No.

Now, the sets are constructed, the game is worked out, the staff is hired, it&#x27;s two weeks before the show is to go on, they are ready to shoot the pilot.

Network: Well, have you thought of anybody yet?

Packager: No.

Network: Let&#x27;s go with Bill Cullen.

That&#x27;s almost exactly how NBC picked the host of &quot;Hot Potato&quot;.&quot;

Cullen appeared as a celebrity guest on many other game shows, including &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Personality&quot;, &quot;The Cross-Wits&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot; (with his wife Ann), &quot;Break the Bank&quot;, &quot;Shoot for the Stars&quot;, and all of the versions of &quot;Pyramid&quot; (excluding the $50,000 and $100,000 versions). Cullen hosted a number of pilots for his close friend, quiz producer Bob Stewart, who created &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Truth&quot;, and &quot;Password&quot; for Goodson-Todman and &quot;Pyramid&quot; for his own company. Cullen thus became the only person to host each of these formats on a full- or part-time basis. He also appeared as a panelist on game shows hosted by his favorite understudy, Bob Eubanks, including &quot;Trivia Trap&quot;, &quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot;, and &quot;All Star Secrets&quot;, and he made guest appearances with Eubanks on &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

In 1982, Cullen made an appearance on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; to promote his new game show, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;. It was the only time he ever appeared on the revival of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, but no mention was made of his role as the show&#x27;s original host.

==Achievements==

Cullen did color commentary on college football games early in his career, and also broadcast track and field on NBC. On &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret,&quot; producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman and host Garry Moore quickly learned to never start the questioning with Cullen if the guest&#x27;s secret was anything sports-related or mechanical, because chances were good that he would guess it immediately. 

During his television career, Cullen was nominated three times for Emmy Awards; his only win was a Primetime Emmy for hosting &quot;Three On A Match&quot; (1973). He was later nominated for Daytime Emmys for his work on &quot;Blockbusters&quot; (1982) and &quot;Hot Potato&quot; (1985).

Throughout his entire career in radio and television, Cullen hosted more than 25,000 individual episodes of radio and television shows.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Cullen was married three times and had no children. His first marriage was a brief one while still living in Pittsburgh. His second marriage (1948–1955) was to singer Carol Ames. On December 24, 1955, Cullen married former dancer and model Ann Roemheld Macomber, born Elise Ann Roemheld (whose sister was, at the time, married to game show announcer and future emcee Jack Narz), the daughter of composer Heinz Roemheld; this marriage lasted until his death in 1990. She occasionally worked as a model on Bill&#x27;s &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and made several appearances with him on &quot;Tattletales&quot;. She died on July 21, 2018, aged 90.

===Physical disability===
Cullen contracted polio in August 1921, when he was 18 months old. The long-term effects of that illness, combined with injuries sustained in a serious motor vehicle accident in 1937 requiring a nine-month hospitalization, made it difficult for him to walk or stand for an extended period of time.

Directors on his game shows took great care to limit the extent that Cullen was shown walking on camera. Each show&#x27;s set was designed to accommodate Cullen&#x27;s limited range of motion; the podiums, game boards, props, and any physical movements by contestants were arranged so that Cullen could, for the most part, remain stationary. Rather than making an elaborate entrance like most game show hosts, Cullen began each show either already seated or hidden on set behind a prop just a few steps from his podium. Similar accommodations were made when he appeared as a guest on other game shows.

As a consequence of these arrangements, many of Cullen&#x27;s peers were likewise unaware of his disability, which occasionally led to awkward situations. In the August 2010 issue of &quot;GQ&quot; under the heading &quot;Epic Tales of Embarrassment&quot;, Mel Brooks related the following story to writer Steve Heisler:

The week of October 17–21 in 1966—that would make me about 40—was a special celebrity week on &quot;Eye Guess&quot;. Bill Cullen was the host. The game was very similar to &quot;Concentration&quot;. I was teamed up with Julia Meade. Remember her? Actress, very pretty young lady, blonde... Okay, never mind. I don&#x27;t think I won, but I did get the take-home game. Anyway, the show is over, and I start walking toward the podium to say good night to Bill, to thank him for having me on. He starts coming toward me cross-stage, and I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing. His feet are flopping. His hands are flying everywhere. He&#x27;s doing this kind of wacky walk-of-the-unfortunates that Jerry Lewis used to do. So I figured, what the hell, I&#x27;ll join him. I start doing, I dunno, this multiple-sclerosis walk, flapping my arms and doing the Milton Berle cross legs—my own Jerry Lewis impression... And Julia is whispering, &quot;No! He&#x27;s crippled, Mel!&quot; I don&#x27;t even hear her. Finally we meet in the middle, we hug, and he says to me, &quot;You know, you&#x27;re the only comic who&#x27;s ever had the nerve to make fun of my crippled walk. Everyone&#x27;s so careful, it makes me feel even worse.&quot; And I realize, Oh, my God, &quot;this guy is really crippled!&quot; It was my worst moment — and if you weren&#x27;t me, probably the funniest thing that ever happened.

In the fall of 1969, shortly after &quot;Eye Guess&quot; ended, Cullen fell seriously ill. Diagnosed with pancreatitis and requiring major surgery, Cullen took time off from work to recuperate. When he returned to television, particularly his position on the panel for &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;, his physical appearance had drastically changed; along with letting his hair grow out, his pancreatitis had caused him to lose over , leaving his face gaunt and wrinkled.

===Hobbies===
Cullen was a midget-car racer, and he was a member of the United States Civil Air Patrol.

==Death==
Cullen was a heavy smoker, and died of lung cancer in 1990. His widow, Ann Roemheld Macomber, died on July 21, 2018.

The village gives its name to Paleis Soestdijk, which from 1937 to 2004 was the residence of Princess and later Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard (who both died in 2004).

Most of Soestdijk is now a neighbourhood of the town of Soest. A smaller part of the former village, including the palace, is part of the municipality of Baarn, and can still be considered a hamlet.

It was first mentioned in 1394 as Zoesdijck and means &quot;dike near Soest&quot; which had been built in 1378 to provide better road access to Utrecht. The palace was built in 1674. In 1840, Soestdijk was home to 108 people. Soestdijk railway station opened in 1898 and is located in Soest. The hamlet in Baarn nowadays consists of about 30 houses.

<text>Mikel Rouse (born Michael Rouse; January 26, 1957 in Saint Louis, Missouri, United States) is an American composer. He has been associated with a Downtown New York City movement known as totalism, and is best known for his operas, including &quot;Dennis Cleveland&quot;, about a television talk show host, which Rouse wrote and starred in.

==Music==
Rouse writes music that is idiomatically and stylistically indebted to popular music, yet he uses complex rhythmic techniques derived from world music, the avant-garde and minimalism, including a technique he calls &quot;counterpoetry&quot; in which separate lines of a song sung by separate characters or groups are set to phrases of differing lengths (such as 9 and 10 beats) and often played over a background time signature of 4/4. Metric sleight of hand, simple in concept but often complex in perception, is common. One of the basic rhythms of Rouse&#x27;s opera &quot;Failing Kansas&quot; is a five-beat isorhythm (rhythmic ostinato) against which either the harmony or drum pattern often reinforces the four- or eight-beat meter.

==Life==
The son of a Missouri state trooper, Rouse grew up in Poplar Bluff, in the state&#x27;s Bootheel region. Early in life, he decided to change the spelling of his first name to &quot;Mikel,&quot; to more accurately represent the name&#x27;s pronunciation. He studied painting and film at the Kansas City Art Institute as well as music at the University of Missouri–Kansas City. When the avant-garde rock band Talking Heads played in Kansas City in 1978, Rouse&#x27;s band Tirez Tirez was the only local band progressive enough to open for them. Tirez Tirez relocated to New York City in 1979 and continued performing until 1987. Meanwhile, Rouse absorbed African rhythmic techniques from A. M. Jones&#x27;s &quot;Studies in African Music&quot;, and studied Schillinger technique with Jerome Walman, one of the few &quot;Certified&quot; Schillinger Teachers in America; both influences came to inform his music. In addition to Tirez Tirez he formed a new ensemble, Mikel Rouse Broken Consort, to work out his new rhythmic language in the context of rock-based instrumentation, making him one of the first composers to notate intricate music for rock group. Rouse&#x27;s association with Ben Neill and Kyle Gann in New York in the early 1990s led to the recognition of a new rhythmic complexity in minimalist-based music that came to be referred to as totalism.

Frustrated by the lack of institutional support for Downtown music, Rouse has made an ambitious bid for composer self-sufficiency. In 1995 he premiered a one-man &quot;opera&quot; &quot;Failing Kansas&quot;, based on the same story as Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, and in 2000 he produced an entire film with music by himself, rather pointedly titled &quot;Funding&quot;. In an opposite direction, he premiered a technologically innovative opera called &quot;Dennis Cleveland&quot; at The Kitchen in 1996, based on a talk show format and with some of the singers/actors spread out among the audience, though with a dense libretto drawn from John Ralston Saul&#x27;s critique of Western society in the latter&#x27;s book &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s Bastards&quot;. In 2002 the opera was presented at Lincoln Center.

He collaborated with Ben Neill on &quot;The Demo&quot;, based on The Mother of All Demos, a technological demonstration of 1968. It was performed in 2015 at the Bing Concert Hall of Stanford University. He received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants for Artists award (2001).

<text>Seven ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; after the city of Liverpool, whilst another was planned:

* was a 44-gun fifth-rate frigate, built as HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; but renamed before being launched in 1741. She was sold in 1756 and became a privateer. She was reacquired by the Navy in 1759 and entered service as the 30-gun . She was sold in 1763.
* was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate launched in 1758 and wrecked in 1778.
* was a 50-gun frigate, later reclassified as a fourth-rate ship of the line, launched in 1814 and sold in 1822.
*HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; was to have been a 58-gun fourth-rate frigate, ordered in 1825 and cancelled in 1829.
* was a fourth-rate screw frigate launched in 1860 and sold in 1875.
* was a light cruiser launched in 1909 and scrapped in 1921.
* was a later light cruiser launched in 1938 and scrapped in 1958.
* was a Type 42 destroyer launched in 1980 and deployed to the Persian Gulf during the Iraq War (Operation Telic).

&quot;Liverpool&quot; was also the former name of the ship-of-the line , which was taken into the Royal Navy in 1836 as a gift from the Imaum of Muscat, Said bin Sultan, to the British crown; however the name &quot;Liverpool&quot; was not used in the Royal Navy for this ship.

==Battle honours==
Ships named &quot;Liverpool&quot; have earned the following battle honours:
*Heligoland, 1914
*Mediterranean, 1940
*Calabria, 1940
*Arctic, 1942
*Malta Convoys, 1942

<doc id="409625" wikidata="Q4886213" url="?curid=409625" title="Ben Neill">
<text>Ben Neill (born November 14, 1957) is an American composer, trumpeter, producer, author, and educator. He is the inventor of the &quot;Mutantrumpet&quot;, a hybrid electro-acoustic instrument.

==Early life, family and education==

Neill was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. His early studies included the North Carolina School of the Arts and Eastern Music Festival, where he played alongside many notable young musicians including Wynton Marsalis. He attended the Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University, where he earned Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees. In 1983 he moved to New York City, and earned a Doctorate of Musical Arts degree from Manhattan School of Music. He also studied privately with La Monte Young and was mentored by Jon Hassell. 

== Career ==
Neill invented the Mutantrumpet, a trumpet equipped with extra bells and valves as well as electronic modifications that allow him to control computer variables with his playing. The first Mutantrumpet (1981) had three bells, six valves, a trombone slide and an analog processing system custom built by synthesizer inventor Robert Moog. In 1985 he first travelled to Amsterdam&#x27;s STEIM Studios to develop a new, MIDI-capable Mutantrumpet; the upgrade resulted in the advances in the number of switches, knobs, and pressure-sensitive pads allowing the player to trigger and modify a variety of sounds and sequences, as well as lights and projections. David Behrman also designed a computer program to facilitate Neill&#x27;s live performances. In 2008, Neill completed a new version of his instrument during another residency at STEIM. In 2014, he returned to Amsterdam to design V4, which made its debut in 2019.

In 1984, Neill completed &quot;Orbs&quot;, his first significant composition for Mutantrumpet, percussion, and audiovisual projections; other early pieces include 1985&#x27;s &quot;Mainspring&quot;, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Money Talk&quot;, and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Abblasen House&quot;, composed for an ensemble of brass, electric guitar, and percussion. &quot;ITSOFOMO (In the Shadow of Forward Motion)&quot; is a major multimedia work created in collaboration with visual artist David Wojnarowicz in 1989.

Neill&#x27;s music has been recorded on the Universal/Verve, Astralwerks, Thirsty Ear, Six Degrees, Ramseur, New Tone and Ear-Rational labels. In 1996, he contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1999, he was included in the &quot;Wired&quot; magazine compilation &quot;Music Futurists&quot;. He has collaborated with DJ Spooky, David Wojnarowicz, Page Hamilton, Mimi Goese and Nicolas Collins, and performed on albums by David Behrman, John Cale and Rhys Chatham.

Neill collaborated with visual artist Bill Jones to create &quot;Palladio&quot;, an interactive movie based on Jonathan Dee’s 2002 novel of the same name. &quot;Palladio&quot; premiered in 2005 at the New Territories Festival in Glasgow, Scotland, and at the Leonard Nimoy Thalia at Symphony Space in New York City. In 2010, his music theater work &quot;Persephone&quot;, a collaboration with Mimi Goese, Warren Leight and Ridge Theater featuring Julia Stiles, was presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Next Wave Festival. The music from the production was released as a CD as &quot;Songs for Persephone&quot; on Ramseur Records in 2011.

&quot;The Demo&quot;, an electronic opera co-created with composer Mikel Rouse and based on Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s 1968 demonstration of early computer technology (called &quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot;), was premiered in 2015 at the Bing Concert Hall at Stanford University.

Neill has performed his music extensively in a wide variety of international settings including the Big Ears Festival 2019, Lincoln Center, Whitney Museum of American Art, Getty Museum, Broad Museum, Moogfest 2011, Cité de la Musique in France, the Berlin Love Parade in Germany, the Festival dei Due Mondi and Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy, the Bang on a Can festival in New York, the Istanbul Jazz Festival in Turkey, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Edinburgh Festival in the UK, and NIME conferences (in 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2013). The Sci-Fi Lounge, his collaboration with DJ Spooky and Emergency Broadcast Network, toured America and Europe in 1997. His 2002 album &quot;Automotive (Six Degrees)&quot; was an early example of the convergence of content and commerce; the album is composed entirely of extended versions of music he originally wrote for Volkswagen TV and Internet commercials.

Neill is also active as a sound and installation artist. His collaborative works with Bill Jones have been exhibited in museums and galleries including Exit Art, the American Museum of Natural History and the Sandra Gering Gallery in New York, and the Wellcome Gallery in London. Neill’s installation/performance &quot;Green Machine&quot; was shown at the Paula Cooper Gallery in 1994. &quot;In the Shadow of Forward Motion&quot;, his major collaborative piece with the late artist David Wojnarowicz, has been exhibited and screened in venues such as the New Museum, Tate Modern in the UK, and PPOW Gallery in New York. It was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Imagining America&quot;.

Neill was the Music Curator of the N.Y.C. performance space The Kitchen from 1992 to 1999, a position in which fostered the burgeoning electronic music scene. He began his teaching career in 2007 as a professor of music technology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). He was a Professor of Music Industry and Production as well as the founder and Director of the MFA in Creative Music Technology at Ramapo College, also in New Jersey, until 2024. In 2025 he was made an Emeritus Professor by the Board of Trustees of Ramapo College.

Neill&#x27;s first book, &quot;Diffusing Music: Trajectories of Sonic Democratization&quot;, was published by Bloomsbury Academic Press in December 2024.
