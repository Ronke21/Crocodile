<text>The Cluj-Napoca Botanical Garden, officially &quot;Alexandru Borza Cluj-Napoca University Botanic Garden&quot; (), is a botanical garden located in the south part of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. It was founded in 1872 by Hungarian linguist Sámuel Brassai, known as the &quot;Last Transylvanian Polymath&quot;. Its director in 1905 was Aladár Richter, then Páter Béla, Győrffy István, and then, in 1920, it was taken over by the local university and by Alexandru Borza.
In addition to its role as a tourist destination, the garden also serves as a teaching and research center as part of the Babeș-Bolyai University. In 2010, the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony categorized it as a historical monument.

The garden is over 14 hectares in area, with over 10,000 plants found throughout the world. It is divided into ornamental, phytogeographic (geobotanical), systematic (taxonomical), economic, and medicinal sections. Romanian flora and vegetation are represented by plants from the Transylvanian plains, the Carpathian Mountains, Banat, etc.

Among the Botanical Garden&#x27;s interesting attractions are the Japanese Garden (a garden in Japanese style, with a brook and a Japanese-style house), the Roman Garden with archeological remains from the Roman colony of Napoca, among them a statue of Ceres, goddess of cereals and bread, alongside cultivated plants that dominate contemporary Romanian agriculture. Jablonovszki Elemér was its head gardener for 45 years.

== History ==
After the establishment of the first universities, the existing herb gardens beside the monasteries were subordinated to them, gradually forming the true botanical gardens where the botanical sciences with their different branches became study disciplines. Likewise is the case similar with the botanical garden of Alexandru Borza of Cluj-Napoca, and its history has been tied to the Romanian University situated in the capital of Transylvania.

=== Precursors ===
In 1872, with the founding of the Franz Josef University in Cluj, the unique botanical department was attached to a vast garden, the attachment having been orchestrated in said park by Count Mikó, the Ardelean National Museum. This was to be later transformed into a botanical garden. A rich collection of trees and shrubs formed the foundation and the promising beginning of a botanical garden. At the entrance of the park was a four-room building, which served as a Botanical Institute and office. The first director, Prof. Dr. A. Kanitz (1872-1896), failed to organize a solid institution. Despite the funds he disposed of having been of minimal value, he could hardly achieve either a systematically medicinal school or a small greenhouse for tropical plants. Consequently, more than three-quarters of space remained unsolved. In 1882, the Institute of Chemistry was built in the middle of the garden. Count Mikó&#x27;s House was transformed into a Zoological Museum, rather than being used as part of a Botanical Museum. In 1897, when the second director, Prof. Dr. J. Istvánffi (1897-1901) was instated, the building of the Botanical Institute was demolished, the whole garden thereby losing its original meaning despite considerable efforts to raise the garden to Western standards. Until 1901 and the instatement of the garden&#x27;s third director, Prof. Dr. Aladár Richter, who had rich experience and modern views, the Botanical Garden was endowed with a larger greenhouse. This greenhouse was raised in the outside garden, which had been abandoned until then. At that time Prof. Dr. Aladár Richter was expecting a flourishing era for this cultural institution when suddenly Prof. Apathy placed her new Zoological Institute in the middle of the botanical garden. Thus, with the Institute of Chemistry and Zoology away from its botanical institute, the Botanical Garden could no longer serve the botanical sciences seriously.

After many efforts, director Aladár Richter managed to convince the government of the need for measures to save the garden. In 1910–1912, as compensation for the museum garden, a great land for a new botanical farden was purchased. The chosen territory was corrugated and rugged, rendering it suitable for different cultures and rare landscapes. It was endowed with separate buildings for the director, staff and household.

Professor Richter retired and thus did not personally handle the arrangement of this garden. For lack of funds and initiative, Gyorffy (1913-1919) also did not handle the arrangement, but rather cultivated fruits and vegetables for hospitals and housed the Hungarian refugees in 1916 during World War I. The new Romanian administration was tasked with transforming the orchard of existing fruit trees into a true botanical garden.

=== Foundation and growth ===
After the Great Union, a conflict emerged between the newly enlarged Kingdom of Romania and staff at the University of Cluj, which refused to recognise the authority of the Romanian state. Consequently, the university&#x27;s assets were nationalised and on 12 May 1919 a committee of 14 Transylvanian specialists was appointed to administer these assets. In the area of biology this task fell to Alexandru Borza. In 1920, Borza and Kornél Gürtler devised a plan for a botanical garden.

In 1920 two neighbouring parcels separated by a creek are bought and the landscaping work begins. The marshy land hosting the parcels is drained and a diverse array of seeds are planted.

In 1923 a dam with a reservoir and a water tower are built. The water tower is accessible to the public and doubles as a panoramic viewing platform overlooking the garden. The rocky sections are landscaped for Mediterranean flora and a Japanese garden is constructed.

In 1924 a greenhouse is set up to host palm trees. New paths through the garden are constructed and paved.

The official inauguration of the garden takes place on 25 June 1925.

A series of renovation and expansion works take place throughout the 1960s. The most notable are six new greenhouses, paving the garden&#x27;s main alleys, and consolidation works on the central lake&#x27;s foundation.

<text>Urban One, Inc. (formerly Radio One) is an American media conglomerate based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Founded in 1980 by Cathy Hughes, the company primarily operates media properties targeting African Americans. 

It is the largest African-American-owned broadcasting company in the United States, currently operating over 50 radio stations. The company also operates digital arm Interactive One, cable networks TV One &amp; Cleo TV, and is a majority-owner of syndicator Reach Media.

As of 2014, it was the ninth-highest-earning African-American-owned business in the United States.

==History==
===Early years===
Radio One was founded in 1980 by Cathy Hughes, a then-recently divorced single mother, with the purchase of the Washington, D.C. radio station WOL-AM for $995,000. She changed the station&#x27;s programming format from all-music to one that examined politics and culture from an African American perspective. Hughes purchased her second station, WMMJ in Washington, seven years later, which began to turn a profit once she converted it into a rhythm and blues station. This established Radio One&#x27;s early strategy of purchasing small, underperforming radio stations in urban markets and refocusing them to serve the demographics of their communities.

After joining the company in 1985 and managing its day-to-day operations since 1993, Hughes&#x27;s son, Alfred C. Liggins III, took over as CEO in 1997, with Hughes becoming the board&#x27;s chairperson. In 1995, Radio One purchased WKYS-FM in Washington, D.C., for $34 million, and also entered the Atlanta market by purchasing WHAT-FM for $4.5 million. In 1997, the company entered the Philadelphia market with its purchase of WPHI-FM for $20 million. The company added numerous stations in the late 1990s, including stations in Atlanta, St. Louis, Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, San Francisco, Detroit and Boston. 

In 1996, Radio One moved its corporate offices from Washington, D.C., to Lanham, Maryland. The company is now based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Under the guidance of recently appointed CEO Liggins, Radio One went public on May 6, 1999, while continuing to be controlled by the family. The company&#x27;s initial public offering was for 6.5 million shares at $24 per share. This made Hughes the first African American woman to chair a public company. As of 2010, Hughes and Liggins control 90% of Radio One&#x27;s voting stock.

In 2000, Radio One purchased 12 stations for approximately $1.3 billion from Clear Channel, bringing Radio One into Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Miami, along with stations in Cleveland and Greenville, South Carolina. Soon after, Radio One added two more Dallas stations. In total, the company added 21 radio stations in 2000.

===Further expansion ===
In 2001, Radio One expanded into 22 markets, with 18 million listeners, making it the nation&#x27;s largest urban-market radio broadcasting company. In February, Radio One purchased rival company Blue Chip Broadcasting for approximately $135 million ($45 million cash with the remainder in stock). The purchase included 15 radio stations owned and operated by Cincinnati-based Blue Chip in Ohio, Minnesota and Kentucky. Earlier that month, Radio One had also purchased another Dallas radio station for $52.5 million. In June 2001, Radio One purchased Georgia radio station WPEZ-FM from US Broadcasting for $55 million. 

In January 2004, Radio One launched the TV One cable network in a joint venture with Comcast. 

In February, Radio One purchased country station WSNJ in Bridgeton, New Jersey, for $35 million; it had been on the air since 1937 and family-owned by the Ed and Katherine Bold family for over 50 years. The company would also purchase KRTS-FM in Houston for approximately $72.5 million in cash, giving it three stations in the Houston market.

In November 2004, Radio One acquired a 53% stake in Reach Media, a Texas-based media company owned by radio host Tom Joyner, for $56.1 million in cash and stock.
From 2006 through the beginning of 2008, Radio One sold nearly $150 million in assets, primarily underperforming radio stations. 

Radio One would reach a peak of owning over 70 stations in 22 markets by 2007, becoming the largest African-American-owned-and-operated broadcast company in the US. In January of that year, Radio One purchased &quot;GIANT&quot; magazine for $275,000. 

However, that same year, Radio One would sell ten stations to Main Line Broadcasting for approximately $76 million in cash. The stations sold were in Radio One&#x27;s markets with the smallest African American populations. The sale decreased the number of Radio One&#x27;s stations from 71 to 61.

In 2008, Radio One launched its Interactive One subsidiary. The company also acquired social networking firm Community Connect, the parent company of BlackPlanet, AsianAvenue and MiGente, for $38 million. BlackPlanet at the time had 20 million members and was the nation&#x27;s fourth-most visited social networking site.

In December 2009, the company suspended publication of the print version of the bi-monthly magazine, relaunching it online as GIANTLife.com. The website is a part of the Interactive One network.

In 2011, Radio One changed stations in Houston, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, from African American to general interest formats, due to low ratings. In May 2018, they purchased Washington, D.C. sports station &quot;The Team 980&quot; WTEM from Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder&#x27;s Red Zebra Broadcasting.

===Rebranding as Urban One===
On May 8, 2017, Radio One was renamed Urban One. Radio One would be retained as the company&#x27;s secondary name, and as a name for its radio division.

On January 19, 2019, Urban One launched Cleo TV, a cable channel aimed at millennial and Generation X African American women.

In April 2023, it was announced that Urban One would acquire the Houston radio cluster of Cox Media Group. This, at the time of the sale, would have resulted in Urban One being over FCC ownership limits, forcing the divestitures of 2 stations in the combined cluster; the stations to be sold were later determined by the two companies to be KROI and Cox&#x27;s KTHT, which would be placed into the temporary Sugarland Station Trust divestiture trust, overseen by Scott Knoblauch. It was reported that Urban was already in the process of negotiations for KROI with a &quot;minority-owned&quot; broadcaster marking their entry into the market; on April 20, it was announced said broadcaster was Spanish Broadcasting System, who would ultimately buy the station for $7.5 million.

==Assets==
===Stations===
As of May 2023, Urban One&#x27;s Radio One division operates 58 radio stations in 13 markets.

===TV One Networks===

TV One Networks is the unit that oversees Urban One&#x27;s cable networks.

On January 19, 2004, Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday, Urban One launched TV One in a joint venture with Comcast. The network primarily produces and airs African American entertainment, lifestyle, and scripted programming.

A sister network aimed at young millennial and Generation X African American women, Cleo TV, would launch in January 2019.

===Interactive One===
Interactive One (also known as iOne), launched in 2008, is Urban One&#x27;s online portfolio of digital brands complementing other media companies. The unit operates numerous digital brands, including NewsOne (a news website which curates stories from other media sources for an African-American audience.), The Urban Daily, and Hello Beautiful. By 2011, Interactive was the largest network of owned and operated sites aimed at an African-American audience, and by 2014, had reached over 18 million unique monthly users on its platform through over 80 national and local brands.

In 2011, Interactive One entered into an editorial and sales partnership with NBC News, aligning NewsOne with NBC&#x27;s The Grio. 

As of 2013, Interactive One has a partnership with Global Grind, a website founded by Russell Simmons and focused on pop culture and music content for African American and Hispanic audiences. In 2015, Interactive One launched HB Studios, a video production studio focused on creating scripted and unscripted programming about women and the diversity of their experiences. The programming will be featured on the iOne Women Channel, HelloBeautiful.com, YouTube and Facebook.

===Reach Media===
Reach Media is a Texas-based media company owned by radio host Tom Joyner. 

In November 2004, Radio One acquired a 53% stake in Reach for $56.1 million in cash and stock. The deal also gave Radio One ownership rights to Joyner&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, which was at the time airing on 115 stations to 8 million listeners; and news website BlackAmericaWeb.com, which had at the time approximately 800,000 members, giving Radio One its first strong Internet presence.

In 2005, Radio One and Reach Media launched a new African-American-centered talk radio network, with programming hosted by the Reverend Al Sharpton, to be broadcast on up to 10 of Radio One&#x27;s stations, as well as stations owned by other companies. 

In December 2012, under a new deal, Radio One increased its ownership stake in Reach Media to 80%. That same month, Radio One announced that the following year, it would merge its &quot;Syndication One&quot; urban programming lineup with Reach Media.

<text>Coleshill (formerly Stoke) is a village and civil parish within Chiltern district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is south of Amersham and north of Beaconsfield.

==History==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Coll&#x27;s hill&#x27;, though it has only been known by this name since the early 16th century. It appears as &#x27;Colshull&#x27; on John Speed&#x27;s maps in the early 17th century. Previously it was known as &#x27;Stoke&#x27;. In 1844 the village was transferred from Hertfordshire to Buckinghamshire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

From 1919 to 1939, the village was home to the Coleshill Convalescent Home, officially opened on 27 June 1919 by Lady Portman. It had 12 beds for soldiers wounded in World War I.

==Facilities==
The village has a primary school (Coleshill Church of England Infant School), community hall, two pubs (&quot;The Red Lion&quot; http://www.theredlioncoleshill.pub and &quot;The Harte &amp; Magpies&quot;), a tennis club with two courts, and a cricket club. A small play park exists in Hill Meadow.

The village has a pond which is notable for the presence of Starfruit, &quot;Damasonium alisma&quot;, which is found at only a few locations in Buckinghamshire and Surrey in Southern England. The pond is centrally located and while the village does have a Common, it is rather hidden from view.

==Notable buildings==
All Saints Church was built of flint and stone in 1861.

The village includes Georgian villas and some 1809 cottages with bottle ends set into the upper walls for decoration.

The site of the long vanished manor house where Edmund Waller was born is nearby. The house known as &#x27;Wallers Oak&#x27; was built in 1909 as a vicarage for All Saints Church.

Porch House, Village Road, was the home of composer and painter Laura Wilson Barker following the death of her husband Tom Taylor in 1880 until her own death in 1905. Her choral setting of Keats&#x27;s &quot;A Prophecy&quot;, composed in 1850, was performed for the first time 49 years later at the Hovingham Festival in 1899.

Just outside the village is The Water Tower a 30 metre (100&#x27;) tall structure which once fed water to Amersham but is now a residential property. This development was the subject of season one, episode four of the TV show Grand Designs

<doc id="401827" wikidata="Q5180551" url="?curid=401827" title="Crafton, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Crafton is a hamlet in the civil parish of Mentmore, in Buckinghamshire, England.

The hamlet&#x27;s name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;farm where saffron grows&#x27;. Edith of Wessex, a queen of England, had a hunting lodge in the small area between Mentmore and Crafton known as Berrystead. The remains of the Lodge, converted in the 15th century to a farmhouse, were demolished when Mentmore Towers was under construction in the mid 19th century.

The hamlet while in the ecclesiastic parish of Wing, is nearer to Wingrave. It is however under the jurisdiction the parish council of Mentmore. There are two 16th century farmhouses, one of which (known as Hellesthorpe) has the unusual distinction of having a Crafton postal address, but is in the parish of Wingrave. Many residents of the hamlet are equally confused by their parish&#x27;s whereabouts, most have chosen to worship and be buried at Mentmore, the village most socially connected to Crafton.

Crafton once had a small Methodist chapel; this is now a private house.

The remainder of the settlement comprises small terraced 18th century cottages. However the hamlet was substantially rebuilt after the 1850s when it became part of the Mentmore estate of Baron Mayer de Rothschild.

In addition to building some cottages the Baron built his famed Crafton Stud farm in the hamlet. In the short space of ten years following its creation the stud farm bred two Epsom Derby winners for the Baron. These were Ladas and Sir Visto.

One of the most attractive buildings in the hamlet is Keeper&#x27;s Cottage, originally the home of the head game-keeper it also served as the lodge to the Crafton drive of Mentmore Towers.

The hamlet is reached only by one small cul-de-sac road. It contains no public house or shop.

<doc id="401835" wikidata="Q74296" url="?curid=401835" title="Kenji Doihara">
<text>was a Japanese army officer and war criminal. As a general in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, he was instrumental in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

As a leading intelligence officer, he played a key role to the Japanese machinations that led to the occupation of large parts of China, the destabilization of the country, and the disintegration of the traditional structure of Chinese society to diminish reaction to the Japanese plans by using highly-unconventional methods. He became the mastermind of the Manchurian drug trade and the sponsor behind many underworld activities in Japanese-occupied China.

After the end of World War II, he was prosecuted for war crimes in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He was found guilty, sentenced to death, and hanged in December 1948.

==Early life and career==
Kenji Doihara was born in Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture. He attended military preparatory schools as a youth, and graduated from the 16th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1904. He was assigned to various infantry regiments as a junior officer, and returned to school to graduate from the 24th class of the Army Staff College in 1912. He had learned to speak fluent Mandarin Chinese and other Chinese dialects, and due to this he would often be given positions in military intelligence.

Doihara spent most of his early career in various postings in China and was involved in activities supporting the Anhui clique, which Japan favoured. By the mid 1920s, Doihara controlled a network of agents and informers among White Russian émigrés, including women working in brothels and opium dens. He secured their loyalty by providing them with a steady supply of opium. Doihara was attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment from 1926 to 1927 and the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment in 1927. In 1927, he was part of an official tour to China and then attached to the IJA 1st Division from 1927 to 1928.

In March 1928, he was assigned to serve as a military adviser to the warlord Zhang Zuolin, who controlled Manchuria, but Zhang was assassinated by a Kwangtung Army officer three months later. Doihara continued to serve as a military advisor to Zhang Xueliang, the son and successor of Zhang Zuolin, but Xueliang disliked him. According to Xueliang, Doihara unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to declare himself Emperor of Manchuria. In 1929, he was promoted to colonel and commanded the IJA 30th Infantry Regiment. In 1931, he became head of the special service section of the Kwangtung Army in Mukden.

==&quot;Lawrence of Manchuria”==

While at Mukden, Doihara assisted Colonel Seishirō Itagaki in engineering the Mukden Incident, by ordering Lieutenant Suemori Komoto to place and fire a bomb near the tracks at the time when a Japanese train passed through. In the event, the bomb was so unexpectedly weak and the damage of the tracks so negligible that the train passed undamaged, but the Kwangtung Army still blamed the Chinese military for an unprovoked attack, invaded and occupied Manchuria. During the invasion, Doihara facilitated the tactical cooperation between the Northeastern Army Generals Xi Qia in Jilin, Zhang Jinghui in Harbin and Zhang Haipeng at Taonan in the northwest of Liaoning province.

Next, Doihara took the task to return former Qing dynasty Emperor Puyi to Manchuria as to give legitimacy to the puppet regime. The plan was to pretend that Puyi had returned to resume his throne due to imaginary popular demand of the people of Manchuria and that although Japan had nothing to do with his return, it could do nothing to oppose the will of the people. To carry out the plan, it was necessary to land Puyi at Yingkou before that port froze; therefore, he had to arrive there before 16 November 1931. With the help of the spy Kawashima Yoshiko, a relative of the Puyi, he succeeded in bringing him into Manchuria within the deadline.

In early 1932, Doihara was sent to head the Harbin Special Agency of the Kwantung Army, where he began negotiations with General Ma Zhanshan after he had been driven from Qiqihar by the Japanese. Ma&#x27;s position was ambiguous; he continued negotiations while he supported Harbin-based General Ding Chao. When Doihara realized his negotiations were not going anywhere, he requested that Manchurian warlord Xi Qia advance with his forces to take Harbin from General Ding Chao. However, General Ding Chao was able to defeat Xi Qia&#x27;s forces, and Doihara realized he would need Japanese forces to succeed. Doihara engineered a riot in Harbin to justify their intervention. That resulted in the IJA 12th Division under General Jirō Tamon coming from Mukden by rail and then marching through the snow to reinforce the attack. Harbin fell on 5 February 1932. By the end of February, General Ding Chao retreated into northeastern Manchuria and offered to cease hostilities, ending Chinese formal resistance. Within a month, the puppet state of Manchukuo was established under Doihara&#x27;s supervision who had named himself mayor of Mukden. He then arranged for the puppet government to ask Tokyo to supply &quot;military advice&quot;. During the next months 150,000 soldiers, 18,000 gendarmes and 4,000 secret police came into the newly founded protectorate. He used them as an occupying army, imposing slave labour and spreading terror to force the 30 million Chinese inhabitants into abject submission.

Ma&#x27;s fame as an uncompromising fighter against the Japanese invaders survived after his defeat and so Doihara made contact with him offering a huge sum of money and the command of the puppet state&#x27;s army if he would defect to the new Manchurian government. Ma pretended that he agreed and flew to Mukden in January 1932, where he attended the meeting on which the state of Manchukuo was founded and was appointed War Minister of Manchukuo and Governor of Heilongjiang Province. Then, after using the Japanese funds to raise and re-equip a new volunteer force, on 1 April 1932, he led his troops to Qiqihar, re-establishing the Heilongjiang Provincial Government as part of the Republic of China and resumed the fight against the Japanese.

From 1932 to 1933, the newly promoted Major General Doihara commanded IJA 9th Infantry Brigade of IJA 5th Division. After the seizure of Rehe in Operation Nekka, Doihara was sent back to Manchukuo to head Houten Special Agency once again until 1934. He was then attached to IJA 12th Division until 1936.

For the key role he played in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, he earned the nickname &quot;Lawrence of Manchuria,&quot; a reference to Lawrence of Arabia. However, according to Jamie Bisher, the flattering sobriquet was rather misapplied, as that Colonel T. E. Lawrence had fought to liberate, not to oppress people.

==Second Sino-Japanese War and Second World War== 
From 1936 to 1937, Doihara was the commander of the 1st Depot Division in Japan until the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, when he was given command of the IJA 14th Division under the Japanese First Army in North China. There, he served in the Beiping–Hankou Railway Operation and spearheaded the campaign of Northern and Eastern Henan, where his division opposed the Chinese counterattack in the Battle of Lanfeng.

After the Battle of Lanfeng, Doihara was attached to the Army General Staff as head of the Doihara Special Agency until 1939, when he was given command of the Japanese Fifth Army, in Manchukuo under the overall control of the Kwantung Army. In 1940, Doihara became a member of the Supreme War Council. From 1940 to 1941, he was appointed Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He then became head of the Army Aeronautical Department of the Ministry of War, and Inspector-General of Army Aviation until 1943. On 4 November 1941, as a general in the Japanese Army Air Force and a member of the Supreme War Council he voted his approval of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

In 1943, Doihara was made Commander in Chief of the Eastern District Army. In 1944, he was appointed the Governor of Johor State, Malaya, and commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore until 1945.

Returning to Japan in 1945, Doihara was promoted to Inspector-General of Military Training (one of the most prestigious positions in the Army) and commander in chief of the Japanese Twelfth Area Army. At the time of the surrender of Japan in 1945, Doihara was commander in chief of the 1st General Army.

==Prosecution and conviction==


After the surrender of Japan, he was arrested by the Allied occupation authorities and tried before the International Military Tribunal of the Far East as a Class A war criminal together with other members of the Manchurian administration responsible for the Japanese policies there. He was found guilty on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36, and 54 and was sentenced to death, while his close colleague Naoki Hoshino, financial expert and director of the Japanese State Opium Monopoly Bureau in Manchuria, was sentenced to life imprisonment. According to the indictment, as tools of successive Japanese governments they: &quot;... pursued a systematic policy of weakening the native inhabitants&#x27; will to resist ... by directly and indirectly encouraging the increased production and importation of opium and other narcotics and by promoting the sale and consumption of such drugs among such people.&quot; He was hanged on 23 December 1948 at Sugamo Prison.

<text>Creslow (occasionally also known as Christlow) is a village and civil parish within Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is close to Whitchurch, about six and a half miles from Aylesbury. It is in the civil parish of Whitchurch.

The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, &quot;Cærsehlaw&quot;, meaning &#x27;cress hill&#x27;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cresselai&quot;.

In the Victorian era and much admired then, there was just one house left in the village, the manor house, which dated from the 14th century. It was then the property of Lord Clifford but has also now disappeared.

The church at Creslow, which dates from the 13th century, was formerly owned by the Knights Hospitaller (the Order of St John of Jerusalem). Following the dissolution of the Monasteries it was held by the Crown, and the whole of the manor was used as pasture for the cattle of the Royal Household. The ecclesiastical parish was abolished by Queen Elizabeth I and the building itself was demolished during the English Civil War, by the regicide Cornelius Holland, and was never replaced.

More recently Creslow was the site of a Foreign and Commonwealth Office/MI6 signals intelligence station, which was closed down in 1998 and, now in private hands, operates as a data processing facility and fibre optic hub under the name Creslow Park.

<text>Dum Dums (stylized as Dum•Dums) are an American brand of spherical lollipops.

== History ==
Dum Dums originated from Akron Candy Company in Bellevue, Ohio, in 1924. I.C. Bahr, the early sales manager of the company, named them, thinking &quot;Dum Dums&quot; was a phrase any child could say. In 1953, Dum Dums were purchased by the Spangler Candy Company and moved manufacturing to Bryan, Ohio. 

Initially, there were 7 flavors: lemon, lime, orange, coconut-pineapple, cherry, grape, and butterscotch.

Spangler once experimented with plastic sticks instead of the current paper sticks, but they were met with complaints of potential injury due to the possible breakage of the unbending plastic in manufacturing leading to plastic fragments in the candy.

==Flavors==
Dum Dums are now made in 17 flavors, with new flavors rotating into the mix every so often, most recently a birthday cake flavor for the 100th anniversary. The &quot;Mystery Flavor&quot; is the result of the end of one batch mixing with the next batch, rather than stopping production to clean machines in between flavors.

<doc id="401839" wikidata="Q154817" url="?curid=401839" title="Good Bye, Lenin!">
<text>Good Bye, Lenin! is a 2003 German tragicomedy film, directed by Wolfgang Becker. The cast includes Daniel Brühl, Katrin Sass, Chulpan Khamatova, and Maria Simon. The story follows a family in East Germany (GDR); the mother (Sass) is dedicated to the socialist cause and falls into a coma in October 1989, shortly before the Peaceful Revolution in November. When she awakens eight months later in June 1990, her son (Brühl) attempts to protect her from a fatal shock by concealing the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism in East Germany.

Most scenes were shot at the Karl-Marx-Allee in Berlin and around Plattenbauten near Alexanderplatz. &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; received numerous honours, including 2003&#x27;s European Film Award for Best Film and German Film Award for Best Fiction Film.

==Plot==

The film is set in East Berlin, in the period from October 1989 to a few days after German reunification in October 1990.

Alex Kerner lives with his mother Christiane, his sister Ariane, and Ariane’s infant daughter Paula. Alex&#x27;s father purportedly abandoned the family for a mistress in the West in 1978. His mother joined the Socialist Unity Party and devoted her time to advocating for citizens. Alex is disgusted with the celebration of East Germany&#x27;s 40th anniversary and participates in an anti-government demonstration. There he meets a girl, but they are separated by the &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; before they can introduce themselves.

Christiane, seeing Alex being arrested and beaten, suffers a heart attack and falls into a coma because nobody initially comes to her aid. Visiting his mother in the hospital, Alex finds that her nurse, Lara, is the girl from the demonstration. She (an exchange student from the Soviet Union) and Alex begin dating shortly afterward.

Erich Honecker resigns, Egon Krenz takes over, the borders are opened, the Berlin Wall falls, East Germany holds free elections, and capitalism comes to East Berlin. Alex begins working for a West German firm selling and installing satellite dishes. He befriends a Western colleague, aspiring filmmaker Denis Domaschke. Ariane&#x27;s university closes and instead of studying economic theory, she now works at Burger King, and is dating its manager (Rainer, who moves into their apartment).

After eight months, Christiane awakens from her coma. Her doctor warns her family that she is still weak and any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. Alex resolves to conceal the profound societal changes from her and maintain the illusion that the German Democratic Republic is just as it was before her coma. He, Ariane, and Lara retrieve their old East German furniture from storage, dress in their old clothes, and repackage new Western food in old East German jars. The deception is increasingly complicated as Christiane witnesses strange occurrences, such as a gigantic Coca-Cola banner on an adjacent building. Denis and Alex create fake news broadcasts from old East German news tapes to explain these odd events. Alex and Ariane fail to find where Christiane keeps her life savings (in East German marks) in time to exchange them for West German marks before the deadline.

Christiane gets stronger and one day wanders outside while Alex is asleep. She sees her neighbours&#x27; old East German furniture stacked in the street, new West German cars for sale, advertisements for Western corporations, and a statue of Lenin being flown away by helicopter. Alex and Ariane take her back home and show her a fake newscast explaining East Germany is now accepting refugees from the West following an economic crisis there.

At the family dacha Christiane reveals her secret: her husband had fled not for a mistress but because of the difficulties he faced for refusing to join the ruling party. The plan had been for the rest of the family to join him. Christiane, fearing the government would take her children if things went wrong, decided to stay. Contrary to what she had told her children, their father wrote many letters that she hid. As she declares her wish to see her husband one last time to make amends, she relapses and is taken back to hospital.

Alex meets his father, Robert, who has remarried, has two children, and lives in West Berlin. He convinces him to see Christiane one last time. Under pressure to reveal the truth about the fall of the East, Alex creates a final fake news segment, persuading a taxi driver (who ambiguously either is or strongly resembles cosmonaut Sigmund Jähn, the first German in space and Alex&#x27;s childhood hero) to act in the false news report as the new leader of East Germany and to give a speech about opening the borders to the West. However, unbeknownst to Alex, Lara had already recounted the true political developments to Christiane earlier that day.

Christiane dies two days later, outliving the German Democratic Republic by three days after German reunification. The family and friends scatter her ashes in the wind using a toy rocket Alex made with his father during childhood.

==Cast==
==Development==
For director Wolfgang Becker, work on &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; began in the summer of 1999, but for screenwriter Bernd Lichtenberg, the work had already begun almost a decade earlier. Lichtenberg&#x27;s experience of the reunification period as a New West Berliner at a similar age to his protagonist Alex was formed into a story which already included many aspects of the later film, but first ended up &quot;in the drawer&quot; for a few years. He stated: &quot;I had the feeling that it simply wasn&#x27;t the right time yet.&quot; This only changed when he saw Becker&#x27;s &quot;Life Is All You Get&quot; (German: &quot;Das Leben ist eine Baustelle&quot;). Especially interested in the mix of sadness and comedy, which he also envisaged for his film, he believed he had found the right person to bring his idea to life. &quot;All of a sudden there was this energy&quot;, recalls producer Stefan Arndt; when he and Becker read the 5-page , &quot;right then we knew exactly we could tell everything that we so badly had wanted to tell&quot;.

Nevertheless, it was not an easy process to finish the script. It supposedly took them six drafts plus a few interim versions to complete the script. Lichtenberg wrote the first drafts by himself. He stayed in close contact with Becker who voiced his criticism, especially of the characters. This was an important point for both of them so it was one they argued over as they both wanted to tell the story &quot;through the characters&quot;. The character that underwent the most radical change was Denis, as he was changed from a main character to a side character. Initially conceived as a young overweight boy from Turkey who was to be married off against his will, he was changed into an amateur film maker, who is as boldly imaginative as he is practical. After completing the script, which the screenwriter and producer worked on together towards the end, their collaboration was not over. During the actual filming, Lichtenberg was involved whenever Becker wanted more changes.

==Soundtrack==

The film score was composed by Yann Tiersen, except the version of &quot;Summer 78&quot; sung by Claire Pichet. Stylistically, the music is very similar to Tiersen&#x27;s earlier work on the soundtrack to &quot;Amélie&quot;. One piano composition, &quot;Comptine d&#x27;un autre été : L&#x27;après-midi&quot;, is used in both films.

Several famous East German songs are featured. Two children, members of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation, sing &quot;&quot;Unsere Heimat&quot; (&#x27;Our Homeland&#x27;). Friends of Christiane&#x27;s (living in the same building) follow with &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Build Up! Build Up!&#x27;), another anthem of the Free German Youth. The final fake newscast with Sigmund Jähn features a rousing rendition of the East German national anthem, &quot;Auferstanden aus Ruinen&quot;.

==&quot;Ostalgie&quot;==
Alex creates fictional newscasts to fool his mother with their earlier East German lifestyle and Communist environment. He goes out of his way to use East German products, such as Spreewald gherkins, to deceive his mother and create a fantasy. His older sister Ariane quickly adopts the new Western ideals and lifestyle, but it is not so easy for Alex. &quot;Ostalgie&quot; is a German neologism for nostalgia for some aspects of life in former East Germany, which is a common theme in &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; Alex shows signs of &quot;ostalgie&quot; when he begins to increasingly criticise the Western changes in themselves.

German-American historian Andreas Daum has suggested a new interpretation, moving beyond the paradigm of &quot;ostalgie&quot;. He argues that Alex&#x27;s efforts to present his mother with an alternate narrative of what happened during her coma are not meant to preserve a bygone state or falsify history. Instead, they use counterfactual history to cope with the unsettling experience of dramatic change. Alex&#x27;s charades are conduits that allow all characters, including himself, to move from what they have been familiar with toward a new future. In this view, &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; does not reflect a nostalgic attachment to the past, nor its retrospective idealization, but the film demonstrates a creative way of handling societal transformations, even beyond the specific East German setting.

==Reception==
The film received generally favorable reviews. It has a rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 32 critics. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film four stars out of five, saying: &quot;An ingenious little idea that is funny, moving and—gasp!—even makes you think.&quot; The magazine also ranked it 91st in &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

&quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; is frequently contrasted with &quot;The Lives of Others&quot;, which was released three years later, in 2006. Both films portray the legacy of East Germany, but with decidedly different tones.

===Accolades===
&quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; was submitted for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but not nominated.


==Adaptation==
An unofficial spiritual Indian remake of &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; was released 17 years later in the form of the Hindi-language comedy-drama &quot;Doordarshan&quot;, also referred to by its changed title &quot;Door Ke Darshan&quot;; written and directed by Gagan Puri, it explores a family&#x27;s attempts to recreate a bygone era to prevent the family matron from suffering a shock when she recovers 30 years after having fallen into coma.

In Japan, Masaki Aiba of the music group Arashi will play the role of Alex in the stage version scheduled for Spring 2025.

<text>The Plessey Company plc was a British electronics, defence and telecommunications company. It originated in 1917, growing and diversifying into electronics. It expanded after World War II by acquisition of companies and formed overseas companies. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 1989, it was taken over by a consortium formed by GEC and Siemens which split the assets of the Plessey group.

The majority of Plessey&#x27;s defence assets were amalgamated into BAE Systems in 1999 when British Aerospace merged with the defence arm of GEC, Marconi Electronic Systems (MES). The Plessey Microsystems division was the subject of a management buyout in 1988 becoming Radstone Technology, which survives today as part of Abaco Systems based in Towcester, Northamptonshire. The bulk of Plessey&#x27;s telecommunications assets were acquired by Ericsson through its 2005 acquisition of Marconi Communications, a successor company of GEC.

==History==
===Early history===
The Plessey company was founded in 1917 in Marylebone, central London. The original shareholders were Thomas Hurst Hodgson, C. H. Whitaker, Raymond Parker and his brother Plessey Parker. A talented German engineer, William Oscar Heyne, was employed by the company. Heyne later became the managing director and chairman of Plessey and was one of the key figures in the development of Plessey during the 1920s and 1930s. The company moved to Cottenham Road in Ilford early in 1919. In 1925, the original company was wound up and a new one was formed with a greater share capital. Most of the early work carried out by the company was in mechanical engineering.

===The Clark connection===
An early customer of Plessey was a galvanising company called British Electro Chemists. One of that company&#x27;s shareholders was Byron G. Clark, an American, who was also a business associate of T. H. Hodgson, one of the founders of Plessey. The Clark family would eventually dominate the management of Plessey for most of its history. Byron&#x27;s son Allen George Clark joined the company in 1921, and went on to become a driving force behind the development of Plessey, followed later by his sons John Allen Clark, and Michael William Clark, both of whom rose to prominent positions in the company.

===Electrical manufacturing===
During the 1920s Plessey began to diversify into electrical manufacturing. Important contracts included the manufacture of early radios for Marconi and the production of telephones for the General Post Office. In order to increase production, Plessey moved to Vicarage Lane, Ilford, in 1923. In 1929, the television pioneer John Logie Baird had his first production televisions made by Plessey. The company also produced the first British-made portable radio in the same year.

The manufacture of electrical components became an area of growth for Plessey. A vast array of components was manufactured, many under licence from overseas companies. Plessey became one of the largest manufacturers in this field as the radio and television industries grew. In 1936/7, turnover was more than £1 million and Plessey became a public company on 17 March 1937.

===Aircraft components===
Aircraft components was another market into which the company diversified. In 1936, Plessey obtained a number of important manufacturing licences from American companies such as Breeze Corporation for aircraft multi-pin electrical connectors, Federal Laboratories for Coffman starters (an explosive cartridge device used to start aircraft engines), and Pump Engineering Services Corporation for the manufacture of Pesco fuel pumps. Plessey went on to produce large numbers of these fuel pumps for Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, and in 1940 the fuel pump for Britain&#x27;s first jet engine was also supplied by Plessey.

===World War II===
During World War II, Plessey produced a vast array of components and equipment for the war effort, including shell cases, aircraft parts, and radio equipment such as the R1155 (receiver), and T1154 (transmitter). In all, 161,500 pieces of wartime electronic equipment were produced.

To allow greater production, Plessey converted five miles of twin tunnel, built for a new extension to the London Underground Central line from Leytonstone to Newbury Park, into a factory. The company also built a new factory at Swindon in Wiltshire, and opened several other shadow factories around the country to produce munitions. Caswell, Northamptonshire became the site of Plessey&#x27;s first dedicated research centre in 1940. The wartime workforce of Plessey grew to over 10,000.

===Post World War II===
With the end of the war the company&#x27;s orders dropped from £5 million in 1944/5 to £263,000 in 1946 and the workforce fell to less than 6,000. Radio and television sales were the main area of activity until the renewed demand for defence products with the onset of the Korean War. From a turnover of £5 million in 1949/50, there was an increase to £32 million in 1959/60.

In 1951, the Electronics Division was started by Michael Clark. By 1955, this had expanded to become the Electronics and Equipment Group with 5,000 staff. The following year the Roke Manor research facility was set up under the direction of H. J. Finden near Romsey, Hampshire. Plessey produced an early integrated circuit model in 1957, before the patents of Jack St. Clair Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild. In the 1960s the Group continued to expand, setting up facilities at places such as West Leigh (Havant, Hampshire) and Templecombe, Somerset.

In 1961 Plessey merged with Ericsson Telephones and Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company of Liverpool, to become Britain&#x27;s largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, including the majority of the country&#x27;s crossbar switches. Alongside the Telecommunications Division, three other businesses were set up: Plessey Avionics and Communications, Plessey Radar and Plessey Marine. In 1967 or 1968, English Electric was subject to a takeover bid by Plessey, but chose instead to accept an offer from GEC. In 1970, the Command and Control unit was set up at Christchurch, Dorset, which became the centre of the Plessey Defence Systems business. In 1979, a major subsidiary was set up, Plessey Electronic Systems, which incorporated the three businesses and by 1986 achieved sales of over £500 million and employed 15,000.

Plessey were partners in the development of the Atlas Computer in 1962 and in the development of digital telephone systems, including System X, from the late 1970s. In 1988, Plessey&#x27;s Telecommunications Division merged with that of GEC to become GEC Plessey Telecommunications. Plessey Naval Systems was formed in 1986 by the merger of Plessey Marine with Plessey Displays, which had been part of Plessey Radar. Plessey were among the first firms to use computers. Their Training Department developed an interactive management game (PITDEX) using TeleType printer/keyboards to link to LEASCO computers in the United States via standard telephones and acoustic couplers.

Plessey also pioneered the gathering and consolidation of accounting information from around the world using in-house software. Each of their 140 management reporting entities used HP125s with DIVAT (data input, validation and transmission) software. Nearly 450 validation rules ensured accuracy within and between various reports. The data were then transmitted to Ilford where a HP 3000 ran Fortran software for consolidation and reporting—also on HP125s. By 1972, Plessey designed the first industrial capability-based security computer, a fault-tolerant multiprocessor system called Plessey System 250. Plessey was also the lead contractor for the Ptarmigan communications system supplied to the British Army, which adopted the System 250 architecture.

A division focused on microcomputing, Plessey Microsystems, was founded in 1975, having licensed the 16-bit Miproc processor architecture developed by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment and Aksjeselskapet Mikro-Elektronikk. In contrast to the existing implementation, announced with a 200ns cycle time, Plessey introduced Miproc with a 350ns cycle time as part of a development system costing $. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Plessey manufactured a series of computer systems and peripherals compatible with Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-11, some based on the Miproc product which was itself revised to operate with a faster 250ns cycle time. The company would eventually expand its Miproc range to include the Miproc RTS, running the RTX real-time operating system, alongside Plessey&#x27;s other product lines featuring semiconductor and bubble memory, and microprocessor-based data terminals.

Plessey Controls, from 1982 to the mid-1980s, also manufactured a type of geiger counter known as the Portable Dose Rate Meter (PDRM). It gave highly accurate readings, using the Gray system of measurement and used standard torch batteries. They were built for civil defence, but also used by the British Army. Most ended up in the hands of the Royal Observer Corps and manufacture would discontinue by the late 1980s.

===UK air defence===
In 1959 AT&amp;E, later Plessey, became the prime contractor for a new UK air defence system, known by the company under the name Plan Ahead and, from 1961, as Project Linesman. To enable the system to be designed and built without too much information becoming public knowledge, a new factory called &quot;Exchange Works&quot; was built in Cheapside in Liverpool city centre, where young employees were granted exemption from conscription.

At the heart of the system, installed in a huge building in the middle of a council housing estate in West Drayton, was the computer room, occupying an area of around and filled with around 1,000 racks of electronics, including mainly the XL4 computer, based entirely on germanium transistors and using a computer language developed at Exchange Works in the 1950s and 1960s. The secure status of the factory attracted many other secret contracts and led to it becoming one of the major designers and manufacturers of cryptographic equipment. Exchange Works is now luxury flats.

===South Africa===
The South African roots of Plessey can be traced to the acquisition of AT&amp;E and Ericsson in 1963, and a Cape Town based company, the Instrument Manufacturing Company (IMC), acquired in 1964.

At the time, IMC was in the process of industrialising a unique South African invention, the Tellurometer, the first successful microwave electronic distance measurement equipment. The instrument was invented by Dr. Trevor Lloyd Wadley of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), also responsible for the Wadley loop receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple crystals.

South African insurance and investment company Sanlam bought 26% of Plessey South Africa in 1974, with first right of refusal to purchase more of the company. These shares were later transferred to Sankorp, Sanlam&#x27;s industrial holdings company. In 1989, when GEC-Siemens took control of the Plessey Company, Sankorp indicated its intention to purchase the remaining 74% of shares in the South African subsidiary.

=== Australia ===
Plessey had a manufacturing plant at Meadowbank in Sydney, Australia that made defense equipment and TVs. In the 1970s and 80s it produced Ericsson Crossbar Telephone Exchanges under licence for Telecom Australia and the PNG Post and Telegraphs department.

===GEC takeover bid===
In December 1985, GEC launched a takeover bid for the Plessey Company, valuing the group at £1.2 billion. Both Plessey and the Ministry of Defence were against the merger, since GEC and Plessey were the two largest suppliers to the MoD and in many tenders the only competitors. In January 1986, the bid was referred to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission (MMC), whose report published in August advised against the merger. The government concurred and blocked GEC&#x27;s bid.

In 1988, Plessey and GEC merged their telecom units to form GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT), at the time the UK&#x27;s leading telecommunications manufacturer.

===GEC Siemens takeover===
In 1988, GEC and Siemens set up a joint holding company, GEC Siemens, to launch a hostile takeover of Plessey. Their initial offer was made on 23 December 1988, valuing Plessey at £1.7 billion. Again, Plessey rejected the offer and again it was referred to the MMC. The original proposal envisaged joint ownership of all of Plessey&#x27;s defence businesses, with GPT and Plessey&#x27;s North American businesses split in the ratios 60:40 and 51:49 respectively. The level of GEC&#x27;s involvement in the Plessey defence businesses was not likely to meet with regulatory approval and in February 1989, GEC Siemens announced a new organisation. In an effort to head off the bid, Plessey announced in May 1989 the closure of its compound semiconductor business in Towcester, Plessey 3-5. The takeover was completed in September 1989.

==Break-up of the business==
In April 1990, GEC and Siemens agreed a new structure of ownership of the Plessey businesses:

==Subsequent history==
===UK===
In 1997, British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace acquired the UK operations and the German part of Siemens Plessey Systems, respectively.

By 1997, the GPT name disappeared in the UK and the company was known as Siemens GEC Communication Systems (SGCS), which later became Siemens Communications. In August 1998, GEC acquired Siemens&#x27; 40% stake in GPT (by now only existing as a legal entity) and merged GPT with the telecoms units of its other subsidiaries, namely Marconi SpA, GEC Hong Kong and ATC South Africa, to form Marconi Communications. In December 1999, GEC&#x27;s defence arm Marconi Electronic Systems was amalgamated with British Aerospace to form BAE Systems.

The remainder of GEC was renamed to Marconi plc, and Marconi Communications became its principal subsidiary. This company was affected by the dot-com bubble and was restructured into Marconi Corporation in 2003, then collapsed in 2005. Most of it (including Marconi Communications) was bought by Ericsson and the remainder became Telent.

The part of GPT which evolved into Siemens Communications would eventually become Siemens Enterprise Communications in 2008.
GEC Plessey Semiconductors (GPS) was purchased by Mitel Semiconductors of Canada in 1998. After a number of downsizes, including the purchase of the power semiconductor and silicon on sapphire operation at Lincoln, Lincolnshire by Dynex Semiconductor in 2000, the company renamed itself Zarlink Semiconductor in 2001. The GPS fabrication plant in Plymouth was acquired by Xfab.

===Plessey Semiconductors Ltd===
After the sale of the Roborough site in Plymouth to Xfab, the original Plessey Semiconductors site at Cheney Manor, Swindon continued to operate under the Zarlink Semiconductor name until it was sold to MHS Industries in early 2008. In February 2009, the UK business was forced into receivership following the collapse of the parent MHS Electronics business in France. After a subsequent management buyout the company traded as Plus-Semi Ltd.
The Roborough site ( 8&quot; and 6&quot; lines) was re-acquired from Xfab on 1 January 2010 and the company renamed as Plessey Semiconductors Ltd. The new company transferred its bipolar processes on silicon and SOI into the 8&quot; Plymouth facility during 2010, exploiting the combined technology base in the development of new processes and products in a number of markets. The Swindon site on the Cheney Manor Industrial estate in the west of the town was demolished in July 2012. In 2011/2, Plessey acquired the rights to disruptive GaN-on-silicon technology by acquisition of CamGaN, a startup company, from Cambridge Enterprises.

Using the GaN-on-silicon technology and semiconductor expertise, Plessey Semiconductors Ltd manufactured solid state lighting, horticultural lighting and medical sensing products. Their GaN-on-silicon i2LED high power LEDs and Stellar Orion Beam Forming modules, launched in autumn 2016, which enabled new form factors of lighting products and remove critical design constraints for lighting product designers. In horticulture, the Plessey Attis Growlight was at the forefront of an engineering approach to LED based plant grow lights which was then developed into a new brand, Hyperion Grow Lights. The company&#x27;s medical products were based on the EPIC sensor, which were used in the advanced portable ECG monitoring device, Impulse, and was also the basis of an R&amp;D program, named Warden, to develop driver alertness monitoring devices in automotive and aeronautical applications.

In 2017, Plessey pivoted the focus of the business to the R&amp;D and manufacturing of microLEDs (micro light-emitting diodes) as a market disrupting display technology for a wide range of applications, including: Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, smartphones, televisions, smartwatches, head-up displays, head-mounted displays and more.

Plessey continues to operate in the Roborough site with leading-edge 150mm and 200mm wafer processing facilities to undertake design, test and assembly of products, and a comprehensive suite of photonic characterisation and applications laboratories.

Their original microLED product was an illuminator for display light engines (DMD and LCOS), which offered a 40% reduction in light engine size whilst delivering higher energy efficiency. They have now upgraded to full-field emissive microLED displays that combine very high-density RGB pixel arrays with high-performance CMOS backplanes to produce very high-brightness, low-power and high-frame-rate image sources. These are innovative products that are widely recognised within the industry with many accolades from prestigious electronics, engineering and display industry award programs, including: Elektra Awards 2017, British Engineering Excellence Awards 2017, National Technology Awards 2018, CES Innovation Awards 2019 and Electronics Industry Awards 2019.

In March 2019, Plessey used their GaN-on-silicon technology, which natively emits blue, to innovatively engineer the early layers within the process to emit native green, opening more opportunities for markets such as military. Plessey also achieved the world&#x27;s first GaN-on-silicon monolithic, wafer to wafer bonding, in May which was a massive breakthrough for not only the company but the industry.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, following the successful GEC/Siemens takeover, after protracted negotiations in 1991, Plessey South Africa became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sankorp under the new name of Plessey Tellumat South Africa Limited (PTSA). The addition of the name Tellumat had a double symbolism, firstly for the company&#x27;s commitment to exports, as it is the name of its UK-based export subsidiary. Secondly, the name derives from the Tellurometer, South Africa&#x27;s world first electronic surveying development—and by implication, a commitment to ongoing electronic research and development.

PTSA continued to grow with a strong focus on telecommunications and defence products, particularly with a major expansion into large projects, rolling out the microwave backbone of MTN, one of South Africa&#x27;s first GSM cellular networks and the installation of a fibre optic network and radio broadcasting system in Malaysia. A software division was formed through the acquisition of BSW data, largely staffed by engineers from the recently terminated South African space programme in which PTSA had also participated, both in the electronics of the launch vehicle and the satellite itself.

1995 was a landmark year in the history of the business in South Africa. The merger of PTSA and Tek Electronics, the consumer electronics audio and video products, manufacturer and distributor, (also wholly owned by Sankorp) took the business full circle back to its consumer electronics roots. This resulted in the renaming of PTSA back to the original name of &quot;Plessey South Africa&quot; Limited. The full acquisition of AWA-Plessey Communications, which Plessey jointly owned in Australia with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd (AWA) and had a similar product portfolio, resulted in penetration into the Pacific Rim market. The culmination of this growth was the company&#x27;s listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) as the &quot;Plessey Corporation&quot; in the same year. Trading started off at R4.80 a share. On the evening of 6 February 1996, a devastating fire swept through two bays of the White Road factory in Retreat, Cape Town causing huge damage to stock, instruments, plant and work in progress. No one was injured, but work was disrupted for several weeks. Large sections of the factory had to be rebuilt.

At the end of 1996, Plessey Corporation sold off the Sales and marketing business of Telefunken, Pioneer and Satellite TV.

In August 1998, Plessey Corporation was bought by Dimension Data Holdings and Worldwide African Investment Holdings for R1.6 billion. The new owners retained BSW Data, Plessey Solutions and Communications Systems. The remaining divisions, notably with a product development and manufacturing focus, were bought back by a combined management buyout supported by Rand Merchant Bank. The corporate name was changed to Tellumat Pty Ltd. Tellumat continues to develop and manufacture Plessey-branded products as before and operates in the defence, telecommunications and contract manufacturing markets.

==Plessey barcodes==

The name is also used to refer to a barcode symbology developed by Plessey, which is still used in some libraries and for shelf tags in retail stores, in part as a solution to their internal requirement for stock control. The system was first used in the early 1970s by J.Sainsbury to identify all of its products on supermarket shelves for its product restocking system. The chief advantages are the relative ease of printing using the dot-matrix printers, which were popular at the time of the code&#x27;s introduction, and its somewhat higher density than the more common 2 of 5 and 3 of 9 codes.

Plessey barcodes use two bar widths. Whitespace between bars is not significant. The start element is a wide bar, and the stop element is two narrow bars. In between, the bars are in groups of four. High order bars appear leftmost. Narrow bars are 0 and wide bars are 1.

This symbology is not self checking, though a modulo 10 or modulo 11 checksum (or some combination of both checksums, depending on application) is usually appended.

<text>Cublington is a village and one of 110 civil parishes within Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about seven miles (11 km) north of Aylesbury. The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;Cubbel&#x27;s estate&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Coblincote&quot;.

==History==
The parish church of St Nicholas is built in the perpendicular style. The tower of the church is decorated with blank tracery windows. Inside, the chancel arch has unusual corbels of a man and a monkey. At one time there was also a Methodist Chapel in the village.

500 yards (500 m) from the church is a small man-made hill, about . high, known as &quot;The Beacon&quot;, it is in fact the motte of a small Norman castle.

North west of the church the 18th-century stable block of the former manor house survives. The building is made of brick, and a granary also survives built on an arcaded basement. This is rare as granaries in the area tended to be built on staddle stones. This type of agricultural building was generally raised from the ground to deter rodents.

Other houses of note include Old Manor Farm, a large low house with a recently created series of gardens; and opposite the church, the former rectory, dating from the 18th century with more recent additions, and an informal garden, open to the public once or twice a year. Neales Farm is an H plan half-timbered house dating from circa 1600.

The village has many old cottages, as well as small enclaves of newly built houses.

In 1971, the Report of the Roskill Commission on the London Airport expansion selected Cublington as the location of a proposed third airport for London on the basis of Cost Benefit Analysis. One Commission member, planner Colin Buchanan, produced a dissenting report rejecting the proposal to build on Cublington as &quot;an environmental disaster.&quot; The government later rejected the Roskill recommendation on environmental grounds, in favour of a site at Maplin Sands, Foulness.

The village pub is called &quot;The Unicorn&quot;.

In World War 2, the pub and village were popular destinations for personnel serving at nearby RAF Wing and the military hospital, built on the eastern edge of Cublington.

Cublington boasts two tennis courts, a trout and coarse fishing lake and a cricket club. The cricket club celebrated its 150th anniversary of the first recorded match in 2013. At senior level, the club runs 2 senior League teams on Saturdays as well as a Sunday side and an occasional Strollers Sunday side.

The nearest shop/post office and secondary school are 2.5 miles east of Cublington in the village of Wing, with Wingrave, also 2.5 miles away, offering a Church of England First and Middle school. The nearest doctor&#x27;s surgery is in Wing.

There are regular bus services to Cublington from Aylesbury and Leighton Buzzard.

<text>Cuddington is a village and civil parish within the Buckinghamshire district in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is near the Oxfordshire border, about six miles west of Aylesbury.

The village name is Old English (Anglo-Saxon) in origin, and means &quot;Cudda&#x27;s estate.&quot; In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Cudintuna&quot;. Anciently the village was the location of a medicinal spring of great repute, though its exact location is unknown. The Church of St Nicholas dates from the 12th Century but was much restored in 1857. Across the road is Tyringham Hall that dates from the 17th Century. During the Second World War the King of Norway who was staying at the nearby Hartwell House attended a church service in the village.

Cuddington is centred on the village green and the road junction linking Aylesbury, Long Crendon and Haddenham. The majority of the original houses were built on the north side but in the last 50 years or so new homes have been built predominantly on the south side.

The current population is around 550 residents. Two of the most famous former residents were Jonathan and David Dimbleby.

The village, like surrounding villages, has been the location of several Midsomer Murders episodes.

Facilities in the village include:
* Shop/post office
* Hairdressing salon
* Pub/Restaurant
* 2 Churches (although one of these is rarely used)
* Village Hall
* Playing Field with Clubhouse, Tennis Courts, Children&#x27;s Park and Cricket and Football pitches

For many years the village has won the regional heat of Britain&#x27;s Best Kept Village Competition and also the Britain in Bloom competition.

Cuddington and Dinton Church of England School is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary aided school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. Cuddington was an infant school but has recently merged with Dinton School to form a full primary school on two sites. There are now just over one hundred pupils on roll.

<doc id="401853" wikidata="Q458702" url="?curid=401853" title="Jordi Pujol">
<text>Jordi Pujol i Soley (, born 9 June 1930) is a retired Catalan politician who was the leader of the party Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CDC) from 1974 to 2003, and President of the Generalitat de Catalunya from 1980 to 2003.

==Early life==
Pujol was born in Barcelona, studied at the German School of Barcelona and received a medical degree from the University of Barcelona. During his college years, he joined different activist groups that were seeking to rebuild the ideal Catalonia that the Spanish Civil War and Franco&#x27;s dictatorship had undermined. Among these organizations were &quot;Grup Torras i Bages&quot; (where he met other activists such as Jaume Carner or Joan Reventós), &quot;Comissió Abat Oliva&quot;, &quot;Grup Pere Figuera&quot; or &quot;Cofradia de la Mare de Déu de Montserrat de Virtèlia&quot;.

In 1960, in the course of an homage to Catalan poet Joan Maragall, held in Palau de la Música Catalana, part of the audience sang the &quot;Cant de la Senyera&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Flag&quot; in English) despite being previously prohibited by the Spanish authorities. Pujol was among those who organized this protest, and he was captured and detained for his protests against the regime of Francisco Franco.

===Invention of Neobacitrin ointment===
As a physician, Pujol was inventor of the antibiotic ointment Neobacitrin while working in the family-run laboratory Fides Cuatrecasas. The ointment went on to achieve great success and is still used today.

==Political career and President of Catalonia==
In 1974, Pujol founded the political party called Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CDC) (&quot;Democratic Convergence of Catalonia&quot; in English), of which he was the first Secretary. The political party was not legalized until 1977, during the Spanish transition to democracy after Franco&#x27;s death in November 1975.

From 1977 to 1980, Pujol was Minister without portfolio in the Provisional government of Catalonia, presided by Josep Tarradellas. In 1977 he led Pacte Democràtic per Catalunya, a coalition of Catalan parties that were trying to approve the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. In the Spanish general election of 1977 he was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies, representing Barcelona. Pujol was re-elected at the 1979 General Election but resigned from the parliament in 1980.

On 20 March 1980, the first Parliament of Catalonia elections after Franco&#x27;s regime were held. The Catalan nationalist party Convergència i Unió (coalition of CDC and Democratic Union of Catalonia) won the elections and Pujol was elected President of the Generalitat de Catalunya on 24 April 1980. He was reelected in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1995 and 1999.

Pujol is a supporter of European integration. In 1985, he started a collaboration with Edgar Faure in the Council of the Regions of Europe (CRE), which would later become the Assembly of European Regions (AER). Pujol was the President of the Assembly of European Regions from 1992 to 1996. In 1996, he was made an officer of the National Order of Quebec for strengthening ties between Quebec and Catalonia.

Pujol retired in 2003. He left leadership of the party (CDC) to Artur Mas. That year, he gave the Biblioteca de Catalunya a bibliographic collection of more than 16,000 documents from his presidency.

==Pujol and Catalan nationalism==
During the last decades of the Franco regime and his 23 years as President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Pujol leant towards the majority tendency in Catalan nationalism, which, instead of seeking a fully independent republic, intended to work towards a federalized Spain that would, according to Pujol, recognize Catalonia &quot;as a country, as a collective with its own personality and differences,&quot; and a &quot;guarantee that her own identity be respected&quot;. With the conservative People&#x27;s Party opposing the Catalan Statute of Autonomy, however, as well as the recognition for the language in the east of Aragon, Pujol has stated that, at least shortly before the Spanish transition to democracy, &quot;there is more aggression towards Catalonia than ever&quot;, and that Catalans can &quot;no longer hope for anything from the Spanish state&quot;.

A lifelong federalist, Pujol has recently become very disenfranchised by the Spanish political arena. He also has recently stated, regarding the recent surge of Catalan separatism that more people than ever want independence, &quot;and they have the right to want it.&quot;

==Personal life==

He married Marta Ferrusola in Santa Maria de Montserrat in 1956. The couple had seven children. During COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, on 15 January 2021 Pujol and his wife Marta tested positive for COVID-19 and, without serious symptoms, they were confined to their home in Barcelona. Marta died on 8 July 2024 at the age of 89 after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for six years.

==Corruption scandals==

In July 2014, Jordi Pujol released a note explaining that for 34 years, including 23 as the President of Catalonia, he had maintained secret foreign bank accounts inherited from his father. The note apologized for his actions and explained that the millions had been declared and taxes paid. The scandal erupted in the Spanish media as it involves allegations against many family members, including trafficking of influence, bribery, money laundering and public corruption. At this time, his sons Jordi and Oleguer Pujol Ferrusola are being investigated by tax authorities. Another son Oriol Pujol resigned from his leadership position in CiU earlier in the month to face charges of public corruption as well. As a direct result of Pujol&#x27;s admission on 29 July, Judge Pablo Ruz issued an indictment against Jordi Pujol Ferrusola and his wife for money laundering and tax evasion.

On 29 July Catalan president Artur Mas, after a meeting with Pujol, announced that Pujol renounced both his salary and the office that he had been assigned as ex-president, as well as the honorary title of founding chairman of CDC and CiU. The opposition parties from both left and right, nationalist and non-nationalist, have demanded he testify before the parliament. The main government allies in the Catalan parliament, Esquerra Republicana, have declared that they support stripping Pujol of all his honors. The Catalan government has declared this a &quot;private matter&quot; that will have no impact on the movement for Catalan independence and the referendum scheduled for 9 November 2014. In announcing his resignation from all party offices, President Mas initially stated that Pujol would keep the right to be called &quot;The Right Honorable&quot; as a former president of Catalonia. Hours later the party spokesperson Francesc Homs stated that Pujol must &quot;forfeit everything,&quot; including the Medalla de Oro of Catalunya and all honorifics previously awarded to him. Indicative of the conflicted reaction of many Catalan nationalists, his personal friend Xavier Trias, the Mayor of Barcelona, lamented on Catalonia Radio &quot;He must disappear...He failed us. It is a disaster that has taken place and the shadowy times of Pujol are finished while a new era begins.&quot; Perhaps no one is more deeply conflicted than current President Mas who has acknowledged that Pujol is his &quot;political father&quot; and has stated that &quot;he does not know the details and he is not interested in them either.&quot; The impact of the Pujol family scandals on the Catalan independence movement, the CIU party and Mas&#x27; political future remain to be seen.

Pujol and his family have been suspected for many years of cashing in on the political power he amassed as a 23-year president of Catalonia. In 1984 his family&#x27;s bank went bankrupt and was taken over by the Spanish government. His children have amassed a fortune in private businesses that frequently did business and received contracts from the Catalan government. Pujol&#x27;s wife and children have investments in the tens of millions of dollars in Mexico, Panama and Argentina. Financial records show the movement of money between foreign banks in Andorra, Switzerland, Jersey, Cayman Islands and other tax havens in excess of €100 million. Critics, including Jordi Pujol Ferrusola&#x27;s former girlfriend, charge that this family wealth could not be accumulated from a family inheritance or successful business practices. Ever since the 1984 bankruptcy of Banca Catalana, as well as in subsequent years, whenever corruption allegations were made against Pujol, his supporters claimed that the charges were politically motivated against Catalonia.

The matter is still under investigation in 2017.

===Impact===
In early September 2014, public opinion polls began to show a measurable impact of the Pujol scandals on Catalan politics and public opinion. According to a poll conducted by El Periódico, a Catalan newspaper, 55% of Catalan voters believe the scandals will negatively affect the &quot;right to decide&quot; on November 9. El País, a Madrid newspaper, likewise found in its polling that 54% of Catalans believe that the corruption scandals are having a negative effect on the independence movement. In addition, over 78% of those Catalans polled by El Periódico believed that the Pujol family had collected illegal payments for government contracts habitually. In anticipation of the 11 September national holiday, the Diada, as well as the planned November 9 vote, the political strategies of the major parties are in flux. Pujol&#x27;s old party has moved to a position of both welcoming (and limiting) his testimony in the Catalan parliament and reasserting that the critics are seeking political advantage from the investigations. Through its public statements the party is trying to remain optimistic about holding the vote while at the same time recognizing that the planned consultation may be deemed unconstitutional by Spain&#x27;s Constitutional court. While the difficulty of maintaining the sovereignty alliance, and the competing demands of legality and democracy, is undeniably challenging for President Mas, his political decision-making has become increasingly difficult due to the Pujol scandals.

On 5 September 2014 The Jordi Pujol Center for Studies announced its closing. The center had been the major focus of Pujol&#x27;s work in retirement sponsoring different academic activities related to ethics and disseminating his political philosophy. The Catalan government and many private sources of income ended their affiliations and it was decided that it was no longer a viable entity in light of the scandals.

<text>The GeForce 4 series (codenames below) refers to the fourth generation of Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce line of graphics processing units (GPUs). There are two different GeForce4 families, the high-performance Ti family (NV25), and the budget MX family (NV17). The MX family spawned a mostly identical GeForce4 Go (NV17M) family for the laptop market. All three families were announced in early 2002; members within each family were differentiated by core and memory clock speeds. In late 2002, there was an attempt to form a fourth family, also for the laptop market, the only member of it being the GeForce4 4200 Go (NV28M) which was derived from the Ti line.

== GeForce4 Ti ==


===Architecture===
The GeForce4 Ti (NV25) was launched in February 2002 and was a revision of the GeForce 3 (NV20). It was very similar to its predecessor; the main differences were higher core and memory clock rates, a revised memory controller (known as Lightspeed Memory Architecture II/LMA II), updated pixel shaders with new instructions for Direct3D 8.0a support, an additional vertex shader (the vertex and pixel shaders were now known as nFinite FX Engine II), hardware anti-aliasing (Accuview AA), and DVD playback. Legacy Direct3D 7-class fixed-function T&amp;L was now implemented as vertex shaders. Proper dual-monitor support (TwinView) was also brought over from the GeForce 2 MX. The GeForce 4 Ti was superior to the GeForce 4 MX in virtually every aspect save for higher production cost, although the MX had the Nvidia VPE (video processing engine) which the Ti lacked.

===Lineup===
The initial two models were the Ti4400 (US$299) and the top-of-the-range Ti4600 (US$399). At the time of their introduction, Nvidia&#x27;s main products were the entry-level GeForce 2 MX, the midrange GeForce4 MX models (released the same time as the Ti4400 and Ti4600), and the older but still high-performance GeForce 3 (demoted to the upper mid-range or performance niche). However, ATI&#x27;s Radeon 8500LE (9100) (a slower-clocked version of the flagship Radeon 8500) was somewhat cheaper than the Ti4400, and outperformed its price competitors, the GeForce 3 Ti200 and GeForce4 MX 460. The GeForce 3 Ti500 (US$299 prior to the GeForce4 release) was rendered obsolete quickly as it could not be produced cheap enough to justify a further price drop, though it filled the performance gap between the GeForce 3 Ti200 and the GeForce4 Ti4400.

In consequence, Nvidia rolled out a slightly cheaper model: the Ti4200. Although the 4200 was initially supposed to be part of the launch of the GeForce4 line, Nvidia had delayed its release to sell off the soon-to-be discontinued GeForce 3 Ti500 chips. In an attempt to prevent the Ti4200 damaging the Ti4400&#x27;s sales, Nvidia set the Ti4200&#x27;s memory speed at 222 MHz on the models with a 128 MiB frame buffer—a full 53 MHz slower than the Ti4400 (all of which had 128 MiB frame buffers). Models with a 64 MiB frame buffer were set to 250 MHz memory speed. This tactic didn&#x27;t work however, for two reasons. Firstly, the Ti4400 was perceived as being not good enough for those who wanted top performance (who preferred the Ti4600), nor those who wanted good value for money (who typically chose the Ti4200), causing the Ti4400 to fade into obscurity. Furthermore, some graphics card makers simply ignored Nvidia&#x27;s guidelines for the Ti4200, and set the memory speed at 250 MHz on the 128 MiB models anyway.

Then in late 2002, the NV25 core was replaced by the NV28 core, which differed only by addition of AGP-8X support. The Ti4200 with AGP-8X support was based on this chip, and sold as the Ti4200-8X. A Ti4800SE replaced the Ti4400 and a Ti4800 replaced the Ti4600 respectively when the 8X AGP NV28 core was introduced on these.

The only mobile derivative of the Ti series was the GeForce4 4200 Go (NV28M), launched in late 2002. The solution featured the same feature-set and similar performance compared to the NV28-based Ti4200, although the mobile variant was clocked lower. It outperformed the Mobility Radeon 9000 by a large margin, as well as being Nvidia&#x27;s first DirectX 8 laptop graphics solution. However, because the GPU was not designed for the mobile space, it had thermal output similar to the desktop part. The 4200 Go also lacked power-saving circuitry like the MX-based GeForce4 4x0 Go series or the RV250-based Mobility Radeon 9000. This caused problems for notebook manufacturers, especially with regards to battery life.

===Performance===
The GeForce4 Ti outperformed the older GeForce 3 by a significant margin. The competing ATI Radeon 8500 was generally faster than the GeForce 3 line, but was overshadowed by the GeForce 4 Ti in every area other than price and more advanced pixel shader (1.4) support. Nvidia, however, missed a chance to dominate the upper-range/performance segment by delaying the release of the Ti4200 and by not rolling out 128 MiB models quickly enough; otherwise the Ti4200 was cheaper and faster than the previous top-line GeForce 3 Ti500 and Radeon 8500. Besides the late introduction of the Ti4200, the limited release 128 MiB models of the GeForce 3 Ti200 proved unimpressive, letting the Radeon 8500LE and even the full 8500 dominated the upper-range performance for a while. The Matrox Parhelia, despite having several DirectX 9.0 capabilities and other innovative features, was at most competitive with the GeForce 3 and GeForce 4 Ti 4200, but it was priced the same as the Ti 4600 at US$399.

The GeForce 4 Ti4200 enjoyed considerable longevity compared to its higher-clocked peers. Debuting at half the cost of the 4600 (US$199 versus US$399), the 4200 remained the best balance between price and performance until the launch of the short-lived DirectX 9 ATI Radeon 9500 Pro at the end of 2002. The Ti4200 still managed to hold its own against several next generation DirectX 9 compliant GPUs released in late 2003, outperforming the GeForce FX 5200 and the midrange FX 5600, and performing similarly to the mid-range Radeon 9600 Pro (ATI&#x27;s permanent successor to the Radeon 9500 Pro) in some situations.

== GeForce4 MX ==
===Architecture===
Though its lineage was of the past-generation GeForce2 (NV11 and NV15), the GeForce4 MX (NV17) did incorporate bandwidth and fill rate-saving techniques, dual-monitor support, and a multi-sampling anti-aliasing unit from the Ti series (NV25); the improved 128-bit DDR memory controller was crucial to solving the bandwidth limitations that plagued the GeForce 256 (NV10) and GeForce2 lines. It also owed some of its design heritage to Nvidia&#x27;s high-end CAD products, and in performance-critical non-game applications it was remarkably effective. The most notable example is AutoCAD, in which the GeForce4 MX returned results within a single-digit percentage of GeForce4 Ti cards several times the price.

Many criticized the GeForce4 MX name as a misleading marketing ploy since it was less advanced than the preceding GeForce3 (NV20). In the features comparison chart between the Ti and MX lines, it showed that the only &quot;feature&quot; that was missing on the MX was the &quot;nfiniteFX II engine&quot;—the DirectX 8 programmable vertex and pixel shaders. However, the GeForce4 MX was not a GeForce4 Ti with the shader hardware removed, as the MX&#x27;s performance in games that did not use shaders was considerably behind the Ti.

In motion-video applications, the GeForce4 MX offered new functionality. It (and not the GeForce4 Ti) was the first GeForce member to feature the Nvidia VPE (video processing engine). It was also the first GeForce to offer hardware-iDCT and VLC (variable length code) decoding, making VPE a major upgrade from Nvidia&#x27;s previous &quot;HDVP&quot;. In the application of MPEG-2 playback, VPE could finally compete head-to-head with ATI&#x27;s video engine.

===Lineup===

There were 3 initial models: the MX420, the MX440 and the MX460. The MX420 had only Single Data Rate (SDR) memory and was designed for very low end PCs, replacing the GeForce2 MX100 and MX200. The GeForce4 MX440 was a mass-market OEM solution, replacing the GeForce2 MX/MX400 and GeForce2 Ti. The GeForce4 MX460 was initially meant to slot in between the MX440 and the Ti4400, while the release of the Ti4200 was held back.

In terms of 3D performance, the MX420 performed only slightly better than the GeForce2 MX400 and below the GeForce2 GTS. However, this was never really much of a problem, considering its target audience. The nearest thing to a direct competitor the MX420 had was ATI&#x27;s Radeon 7000. In practice its main competitors were chipset-integrated graphics solutions, such as Intel&#x27;s 845G and Nvidia&#x27;s own nForce 2, but its main advantage over those was multiple-monitor support; Intel&#x27;s solutions did not have this at all, and the nForce 2&#x27;s multi-monitor support was much inferior to what the MX series offered.
The MX440 performed reasonably well for its intended audience, outperforming its closest competitor, the ATI Radeon 7500, as well as the discontinued GeForce2 Ti. Despite harsh criticism by gaming enthusiasts, the MX440 was successful in the PC OEM market as a replacement for the GeForce2 MX. Priced about 30% above the GeForce2 MX, it provided better performance, the ability to play a number of popular games that the GeForce2 could not run well—above all else—to the average non-specialist it sounded as if it were a &quot;real&quot; GeForce4—i.e., a GeForce4 Ti. While John Carmack initially warned gamers not to purchase the GeForce 4 MX440, its somewhat widespread adoption compelled id Software to make it the only DirectX 7.0 GPU supported by Doom 3. When ATI launched its Radeon 9000 Pro in September 2002, it performed about the same as the MX440, but had crucial advantages with better single-texturing performance and proper support of DirectX 8 shaders. However, the 9000 was unable to break the MX440&#x27;s entrenched hold on the OEM market. Nvidia&#x27;s eventual answer to the Radeon 9000 was the GeForce FX 5200, but despite the 5200&#x27;s DirectX 9 features it did not have a significant performance increase compared to the MX440 even in DirectX 7.0 games. This kept the MX440 in production while the 5200 was discontinued. 

One of the fastest DirectX 7.0 compliant GPUs, the MX460&#x27;s performance was similar to the discontinued GeForce 2 Ultra and the existing GeForce3 Ti200 (the remaining available member of the GeForce 3 family). However, ATI released the Radeon 8500LE which outperformed its price competitors, the GeForce 3 Ti200 and GeForce4 MX 460. ATI&#x27;s move in turn compelled Nvidia to roll out the Ti4200 earlier than planned, also at a similar price to the MX 460, and soon afterwards discontinuing the Ti200. The Ti200, 8500LE, and Ti4200 were all DirectX 8.0 compliant while having similar market pricing to the MX460, while the 8500LE and Ti4200 also provided significantly better performance than the MX460, prevented the MX460 from ever being popular compared to the other GeForce 4 MX releases.

The GeForce4 Go was derived from the MX line and it was announced along with the rest of the GeForce4 Ti and MX lineup in early 2002. There was the 420 Go, 440 Go, and 460 Go. However, ATI had beaten them to the market with the similarly performing Mobility Radeon 7500, and later the DirectX 8.0 compliant Mobility Radeon 9000. (Despite its name, the short-lived 4200 Go (NV28M) is not part of this lineup, it was instead derived from the Ti line.)

Like the Ti series, the MX was also updated in late 2002 to support AGP-8X with the NV18 core. The two new models were the MX440-8X, which was clocked slightly faster than the original MX440, and the MX440SE, which had a narrower memory bus, and was intended as a replacement of sorts for the MX420. The MX460, which had been discontinued by this point, was never replaced. Another variant followed in late 2003—the MX 4000, which was a GeForce4 MX440SE with a slightly higher memory clock.

The GeForce4 MX line received a third and final update in 2004, with the PCX 4300, which was functionally equivalent to the MX 4000 but with support for PCI Express. In spite of its new codename (NV19), the PCX 4300 was in fact simply an NV18 core with a BR02 chip bridging the NV18&#x27;s native AGP interface with the PCI-Express bus.

== GeForce4 model information ==

* All models are manufactured via TSMC 150 nm manufacturing process
* All models support nView


===GeForce4 Go mobile GPU series===
* Mobile GPUs are either soldered to the mainboard or to some Mobile PCI Express Module (MXM).
* All models are made via 150 nm fabrication process


== GeForce4 Go driver support ==
This family is a derivative of the GeForce4 MX family, produced for the laptop market. The GeForce4 Go family, performance wise, can be considered comparable to the MX line.

One possible solution to the lack of driver support for the Go family is the third party Omega Drivers. Using third party drivers can, among other things, invalidate warranties. The Omega Drivers are supported by neither laptop manufacturers, laptop ODMs, nor by Nvidia. Nvidia attempted legal action against a version of Omega Drivers that included the Nvidia logo.

== Discontinued support ==

Nvidia has ceased driver support for GeForce 4 series.

<doc id="401855" wikidata="Q2092944" url="?curid=401855" title="1992 World Series">
<text>The 1992 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1992 season. The 89th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven, or first to four playoff, played between the American League (AL) champion Toronto Blue Jays and the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves. Toronto defeated Atlanta in six games, marking the first time a team based outside the United States won the World Series. The Blue Jays became the first Canadian sports team in a major North American league to win a championship other than the NHL’s Stanley Cup, and they remain the only Canadian team to have appeared in, and won, a World Series (which they would do again the following year in ). The 1992 World Series was the first World Series in which games were played outside the United States, as well as the first to have games played in a stadium with a retractable roof, Toronto&#x27;s SkyDome.

==Background==

The Blue Jays won the American League East Division title for the second consecutive season and third time in four years. They faced the winners of the West Division, the Oakland Athletics, in the American League Championship Series (ALCS). The A&#x27;s were looking to advance to the World Series for the fourth time in five years, having previously been in the World Series in 1988, 1989, and 1990, winning it in 1989. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were looking to become the first Canadian team to win a pennant. The Blue Jays lost the first game at home but then won the next three to take a commanding lead, eventually closing the series out at home in Game 6.

The Braves won the National League West Division for the second straight season and earned another matchup with the three-time defending East Division winners, the Pittsburgh Pirates, in the National League Championship Series (NLCS). The Braves won three of the first four games in the series, but the Pirates won the next two and were leading in the bottom of the ninth in Game 7 before the Braves rallied, capped off by a single by seldom-used pinch hitter Francisco Cabrera that drove in two runs and won the series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

Braves fans had plenty to worry about in regard to both starting pitchers. Tom Glavine&#x27;s postseason career had been less than stellar, including giving up eight runs in the second inning of Game 6 of the NLCS against Pittsburgh. Entering Game 1, Glavine&#x27;s career post-season record was 1–5 despite two starts where he had pitched well and only given up one earned run each time. Glavine was 0–2 in those starts. 

In addition to Glavine&#x27;s struggles in the postseason, the Braves would be facing their nemesis from the previous postseason. Before the 1992 season, the Blue Jays signed the MVP of the 1991 World Series, Jack Morris. The Braves were more than familiar with Morris&#x27; work, as he had defeated them twice in three starts and only allowed three runs. One of the victories came in the decisive seventh game, where Morris pitched a ten-inning complete game shutout. Morris&#x27; results in 1992, however, were quite the opposite. Despite leading the Blue Jays with 21 wins in the regular season, Morris had not performed well in the postseason. He lost one of his two starts in the 1992 ALCS despite throwing a complete game and took a no-decision in his other start giving up five runs.

Toronto&#x27;s other big offensive acquisition had been veteran Dave Winfield, who entered his 20th season in 1992 having yet to win a World Series ring. Winfield, primarily the team&#x27;s designated hitter, paid dividends by recording his best batting average and runs batted in numbers in several years and hit two home runs in the ALCS. His presence in the lineup was one that manager Cito Gaston wanted to keep, which forced some maneuvering of the lineup for the games to be played in Atlanta under National League rules; Winfield&#x27;s natural position was right field, which was manned by All-Star Joe Carter during the season. Therefore, for Game 1, Winfield was inserted into Carter&#x27;s place in the outfield. Carter, in turn, played first base in place of normal starter John Olerud.

Both teams had early scoring opportunities but could not cash in on them. In the bottom of the first inning, Braves center fielder and lead off hitter Otis Nixon singled and stole second. After Jeff Blauser tried and failed to advance him on a bunt, Nixon reached third on a groundout by Terry Pendleton. Morris, however, struck out David Justice to end the inning. Toronto responded in the next half inning with Winfield reaching on a single. After Glavine struck out Candy Maldonado and got Kelly Gruber to pop out, Pat Borders singled to put two runners on. Glavine got out of the inning, though, by inducing Manuel Lee to ground into a fielder&#x27;s choice that retired Borders at second. 

Carter opened scoring in the series in the top of the fourth, pulling a solo home run. The Braves threatened with two outs in the bottom half of the inning. Morris walked Justice and Sid Bream after retiring Blauser and Pendleton to start the inning. Then, on his second pitch to Ron Gant, Morris threw a wild pitch, advancing the runners to second and third. Morris ended the threat, however, by striking out Gant. 

After Glavine retired Toronto in order in the top of the fifth, Morris again ran into a jam in the Atlanta half of the inning. Like he had in the fourth, Morris retired the first two batters by getting Damon Berryhill to fly out to deep center field and retiring Mark Lemke on a groundout. But as he had in the previous inning, he extended the inning by walking Glavine and Nixon. Blauser struck out swinging to end the inning, keeping the shutout intact. To this point, Nixon&#x27;s single in the first stood as the only Braves hit. 

Morris went back to work in the bottom of the sixth after the Blue Jays again went down in order in the top half. He got Pendleton to ground out, but walked Justice for the second time in as many plate appearances. Bream followed with a single that advanced Justice to second, but was himself retired on a fielder&#x27;s choice by Gant on the next at bat. Gant then stole second to put the go ahead run into scoring position. 

Up stepped Berryhill, who had hit a deep fly ball against Morris the last time he had faced him. Berryhill later said he had gone up to the plate looking for Morris to throw him a forkball, as he had observed that Morris had been able to get several strikeouts with the pitch so far. The Braves’ catcher took advantage of a pitch that Morris was unable to get enough break on and drove it over the right field wall to give the Braves the lead. Morris said after the game that was the only forkball that caused him trouble. 

The three-run home run would prove to be the only offense the Braves would need that night. Glavine retired the Blue Jays in order in the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings, while the Braves only managed to have one runner reach base against relievers Todd Stottlemyre and David Wells after Morris left the game following the sixth. 

Glavine went the distance for the victory, only giving up four total hits. In taking the loss, Morris suffered his first career World Series defeat in his sixth start, with one no-decision. Berryhill&#x27;s home run marked the first runs Morris had given up in the World Series since Pendleton hit a home run in the bottom of the third inning of Game 4 of the 1991 Series. Morris pitched an additional innings in that game, all 10 in Game 7, and the first innings of this game to run his World Series scoreless streak to 19 innings.

===Game 2===
Before the game started, during the performance of the National Anthems of the United States and Canada, the U.S. Marine Corps Color Guard accidentally flew the flag of Canada upside down The Corps apologized for the error and took pains to carry the flag properly prior to Game 3 in Toronto after insisting that they would be honored to do so. Also, Canadian rock/country musician Tom Cochrane sang the Canadian national anthem incorrectly. Instead of singing the line &quot;... from far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee ...&quot;, Cochrane instead sang a lyric that was in the previous version of the anthem: &quot;... O Canada, we stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee ...&quot;. Not only did Cochrane substitute the archaic lyric, he also did not sing it correctly, as the lyric said &quot;and stand on guard, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee&quot; before it was changed. Peabo Bryson sang the American national anthem.

The pitching match-up featured, strangely, the two leading strikeout pitchers in the National League in 1992. On August 27, 1992, the Blue Jays traded rookie infielder Jeff Kent and minor league outfield prospect Ryan Thompson to the New York Mets for ace starting pitcher, David Cone. At the time of the trade, Cone had been leading the National League in strikeouts and was looking to do so for a third consecutive season. Major League Baseball rules dictate that when a player changes leagues during a season, the statistics he earns in each league are kept separate from each other. As such, Cone&#x27;s total of 214 strikeouts with the Mets was frozen. Smoltz eventually caught and passed Cone in his last start of the season on October 2, finishing with 215 strikeouts to lead the league. Cone, meanwhile, settled for the overall major league lead, with a career high 261 strikeouts.

Both pitchers had some success thus far in the postseason. Smoltz started three games in the NLCS, winning two and being saved from a loss when the Braves made a two-out rally in the decisive final game; his performance was enough to make him the series MVP. Cone started the second and fifth games of the ALCS, winning his first start by allowing one run over eight innings. His second start saw him give up six runs, three of them unearned, over four innings, saddling him with the loss.

A controversial call was made by umpire Mike Reilly in the top of the fourth inning with Atlanta leading 1–0 after David Justice walked, stole second, advanced to third on Manuel Lee&#x27;s error on Jeff Blauser&#x27;s ground ball, and scored on a wild pitch from Cone in the bottom of the second. Roberto Alomar was at third base with John Olerud batting. Smoltz threw a breaking ball that skipped past Damon Berryhill. Alomar broke for home plate while Berryhill went to retrieve the ball. As Smoltz moved in to receive the throw he nearly collided with a sliding Alomar, who had reached the plate at exactly the same time that both Smoltz and the ball did. Smoltz tagged Alomar and Reilly called him out on the close play, despite an angry Alomar&#x27;s protest, and the inning came to an end. Replays shown by CBS showed that Alomar likely touched the plate with his hands before Smoltz was able to apply a tag. The Braves scored again in the bottom of the fourth, when Sid Bream walked and eventually scored on a Mark Lemke two-out single to make the score 2–0.

In the top of the fifth Pat Borders and Manuel Lee both reached base in front of Cone, who had already singled earlier in the game. Cone responded with his second hit of the game to drive in Borders and cut the Atlanta lead to 2–1. Cone was only the second AL pitcher to get a hit in the World Series since 1980. Lee then scored on a single by Devon White, tying the game. The Braves rallied in the bottom half of the inning, with Deion Sanders providing a spark. With one out, Sanders singled. He then immediately stole second, and after Borders made an errant throw he got up and ran to third. Cone then walked Terry Pendleton, then gave up the go-ahead run when David Justice singled in Sanders and moved Pendleton to third. Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston then pulled Cone in favor of David Wells, who gave up the fourth Atlanta run, all charged to Cone, on pinch hitter Brian Hunter&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored Pendleton.

Toronto made another rally in the eighth inning. After Alomar doubled to left with one out, Joe Carter and Dave Winfield hit back to back singles, the second of which scored Alomar and cut the lead to 4–3. Smoltz was then replaced by left-handed specialist Mike Stanton, who retired Olerud for the second out.

With third baseman Kelly Gruber stepping to the plate, the Braves called upon their own August trade acquisition to pitch, former Boston Red Sox closer and the then-holder of baseball&#x27;s all-time career saves record Jeff Reardon. He managed to strike Gruber out, preserving Atlanta&#x27;s lead, which did not change as setup man Duane Ward set them down in order in the bottom of the eighth. 

The Jays entered the ninth trailing by one run and turned to their bench, which the team had nicknamed &quot;The Trenches.&quot; After a walk to pinch-hitter Derek Bell (batting for Lee), Toronto reserve infielder Ed Sprague Jr. pinch-hit for Ward and drilled a pitch from Reardon to left for a two-run homer to give the Blue Jays the lead. The play was called by legendary Blue Jays announcer Tom Cheek, who said &quot;Watch him hit a homer&quot; during Sprague&#x27;s at bat.

Atlanta tried to rally in the ninth. After Mark Lemke flew out, pinch hitter Lonnie Smith was hit by a pitch from Toronto closer Tom Henke. Ron Gant came in to pinch run for Smith. After Otis Nixon recorded the second out, Gant stole second. Sanders then walked to put the winning run on base as Pendleton, an NL MVP candidate, came to the plate. Pendleton had led the majors with a .391 average with runners in scoring position in the regular season. However, he hit a foul infield pop up to Gruber to seal the victory for Toronto. After the catch, Gruber did a short, mocking Tomahawk Chop, which upset Atlanta fans.

===Game 3===

Before this game, the U.S. Marine Corps Color Guard offered to hoist the Canadian flag once more in order to make amends for the inverted flag incident of Game 2. Likewise, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police flew the United States flag. The two guards received a standing ovation from the Toronto fans. Anne Murray sang the Canadian national anthem, and Jon Secada sang the American national anthem.

As Game 3 moved across the border for the first Fall Classic game in Canada, the question still remained of the Blue Jays&#x27; homefield advantage. The Blue Jays had a 3–6 postseason record at the SkyDome, losing 6 consecutive games from the 1989 ALCS to Game 1 of the 1992 ALCS. However, they had a two game home win streak, beating the Athletics in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6 of the 1992 ALCS.

The Game 3 starters were Steve Avery for the Braves and Juan Guzmán for the Blue Jays. The left-handed Avery was a workhorse, throwing a career high innings in the regular season and 8 innings in three NCLS appearances, though his results were worse than the previous season, when he received Cy Young Award votes, and the following season, when he was an All-Star. Guzmán was coming off his only All-Star Game appearance and led the Blue Jays with 165 strikeouts. He was the winning pitcher in Games 3 and 6 of the ALCS.

In the fourth inning, the first big defensive play of the Series nearly resulted in a triple play. Deion Sanders and Terry Pendleton reached base to start the inning. With no outs, David Justice hit a deep fly headed toward the center field wall. Devon White chased down the ball, leaping to snare it before crashing into the wall. On the basepaths, Sanders and Pendleton watched White&#x27;s catch. Sanders retreated to second base to tag up, crossing paths with a stationary Pendleton, who was slow to turn and head back to first. By rule, Pendleton was out, though the relay throw from the outfield beat Pendleton back to first base. As Sanders tried to advance to third, John Olerud threw from first to third baseman Kelly Gruber, who chased Sanders back to second. Sanders slid into second base as Gruber lunged to tag him. Second base umpire Bob Davidson called Sanders safe, and Gruber argued with Davidson that he&#x27;d tagged out Sanders. Television replays showed Gruber&#x27;s glove may have touched Sanders. The Braves would not score that inning, as Guzman struck out the next batter, Lonnie Smith, to end the threat. 

With one out in the bottom of the fourth, Joe Carter hit a home run off of Avery. Carter&#x27;s second blast past the left field wall of the series was the first World Series run scored outside the United States as well as the first World Series home run hit in Canada.

The Blue Jays still led 1–0 when the Braves mounted a rally in the top of the sixth inning. With one out, Sanders doubled off of Guzman. Pendleton singled to advance Sanders to third, and Justice then added his own single to score Sanders, tying the game. Guzman recovered, retiring Smith and Sid Bream to leave Pendleton, the go-ahead run, stranded at second.

The Braves took the lead in the eighth. Otis Nixon led off with a line drive to the left side. The ball hit Gruber&#x27;s glove, and the Braves had the go-ahead run on base due to an error. Nixon stole second, putting himself in scoring position with nobody out. Guzman retired Sanders and Pendleton, but Nixon advanced to third on the latter&#x27;s groundout. Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston intentionally walked to pitch to Smith. The move backfired, as Smith singled to score Nixon and give Atlanta a 2-1 lead. On the play, Justice was thrown out trying to advance to third by Candy Maldonado, who initially bobbled the ball.

In the bottom of the eighth, Gruber had the chance to make up for his fielding error and snap a long hitless streak. After going hitless in the ALCS opener, Gruber hit a home run and a double in the second game, both of which led to decisive runs in that game. Those had been the only two hits he had recorded to that point in the postseason, as he failed to record a hit in the subsequent four ALCS games or the first two games in the World Series, going 0-for-1 with a walk so far in Game 3. After going 0-for-23, Gruber worked a full count on Avery and then drilled a home run to left field to tie the game. Gruber only had one more hit in the rest of the series.

Duane Ward replaced Guzman for the top of the ninth and gave up a single to Bream. The sequence of events that followed resulted in something that had not occurred in the World Series in seven years. Bream was a notoriously slow baserunner, and Braves manager Bobby Cox often replaced him with a pinch runner late in games. Cox put in Brian Hunter to run. Ward then faced shortstop Jeff Blauser. On a 2–2 count, Cox called for a hit-and-run. Blauser tried to check his swing as Blue Jays catcher Pat Borders threw down to second to nab Hunter. Shortstop Manuel Lee tagged Hunter out then pointed to first base to get Borders to check for an appeal on Blauser&#x27;s check swing. Umpire Dan Morrison ruled that Blauser swung at the pitch, resulting in a strikeout. A mad Cox threw a batting helmet onto the cement floor of the dugout, bouncing the helmet onto the field. Home plate umpire Joe West ejected Cox, who argued with West for more than a minute. The next day, Cox complained about other balls and strikes calls during Game 2. The last time a manager was ejected from a World Series game was Whitey Herzog in 1985. Smith emerged from the dugout to argue as well, believing that he had also been ejected, but he remained in the game.

Avery gave up a single to Roberto Alomar to lead off the bottom of the ninth. Acting manager Jimy Williams, Atlanta&#x27;s third base coach, pulled Avery from the game and brought in hard-throwing Mark Wohlers to face Carter. CBS announcer Tim McCarver questioned the strategy, because Alomar was a threat to steal a base and the left-handed Avery had a quicker pickoff move than the right-handed Wohlers. On a 2–0 pitch, Alomar stole second. Wohler&#x27;s pitch was a ball. Down 3–0, the Braves intentionally walked Carter. The cleanup hitter Dave Winfield was the next batter, but Gaston did not let him swing away. Winfield dropped down a sacrifice bunt, advancing the winning run to third with one out.

Olerud, a left-handed batter, was due up next, so Williams replaced Wohlers with Mike Stanton, his left-handed specialist, to face the Blue Jays’ first baseman. Gaston responded by calling on right-handed Ed Sprague Jr., who had a pinch-hit home run in the in Game 2, to pinch hit to give the Blue Jays a platoon advantage. The Braves responded by intentionally walking Sprague, loading the bases. Closer Jeff Reardon came in to face Maldonado. 

Reardon had handled Maldonado well in the past, allowing only two hits, both doubles, in 14 plate appearances. Maldonado whiffed at two straight breaking balls. On Reardon&#x27;s third offspeed pitch, Maldonado drove the ball over a drawn-in outfield to bring home Alomar with the winning run, giving the Blue Jays the lead in the series. Like Gruber after Game 2, Alomar celebrated with a mocking Tomahawk Chop as he trotted to home plate.

Ward earned his second win of the series. Avery took the loss, as he was responsible for Alomar reaching in the ninth. Reardon did not pitch again in the series after his back to back poor performances. He did not pitch in a postseason game again, retiring in 1994. While Williams was the acting manager in the bottom of the ninth inning, Cox admitted after the game that he called for all of Atlanta&#x27;s pitching changes from just beyond the team&#x27;s dugout.

===Game 4===
The Braves continued to employ the short rotation they had used during the postseason and sent Tom Glavine, the Game 1 winner, out for his second start of the series, bypassing 15-game-winner Charlie Leibrandt, who had only seen mop-up duty for Atlanta in Games 5 and 6 of the NLCS. For the Blue Jays, veteran Jimmy Key was given the start. Key had been with the Blue Jays since 1984 and was one of several players from their first ever division champion squad that were still with the team. However, he had not performed particularly well during the season and Cito Gaston had not included him in the ALCS rotation; Key only pitched in Toronto&#x27;s Game 5 loss in relief.

The Braves began the game with a single off the bat of Otis Nixon, who was a threat to steal a base. Although Key managed to pick Nixon off of first, he immediately gave up a single to Jeff Blauser, hitting second in place of the resting Deion Sanders, and allowed him to steal second. Key neutralized the threat by forcing Terry Pendleton to line out and Lonnie Smith to ground out. Over the next six innings, the Braves only recorded one hit (another single by Nixon) and did not advance the runner past first base.

In the third inning, the Blue Jays scored their first run when Pat Borders hit a home run. They added a second run in the bottom of the seventh, which would prove decisive, when Kelly Gruber scored on a single by Devon White with two out.

The Braves broke through against Key in the eighth. Ron Gant, starting in place of Sanders, led off with a double. Brian Hunter, starting at first base in place of Sid Bream, followed by beating out a bunt down the third base line to put runners on the corners with nobody out. Key recorded back-to-back outs, retiring Damon Berryhill on a failed sacrifice bunt attempt that didn&#x27;t advance the runners and getting Mark Lemke to ground out to third. On the Lemke play, Gant scored the Braves&#x27; first run of the game and with the tying run now in scoring position as Hunter advanced to second on the groundout, Key was removed from the game. On his way off the field, he tipped his cap to the fans as they gave him a standing ovation.

Duane Ward was brought in for his third consecutive appearance and his first batter was Nixon, who had recorded two of the Braves&#x27; hits. Although Ward got Nixon to strike out swinging, the third strike got past Borders and Nixon took off for first base, and being a speedy runner he was able to reach first safely, ahead of the throw. Nixon then stole second to put the go-ahead runs in scoring position, with Hunter having advanced to third on the wild pitch. Blauser, however, ended the inning by grounding out to Olerud. Tom Henke closed the game for the Blue Jays by retiring Pendleton, Smith, and David Justice in order in the ninth and Toronto found itself a win away from becoming the first World Series championship team from outside the United States. Tom Glavine would pitch another solid complete game, but his bad luck in the postseason continued and he was charged with a loss—the third time he had lost a post-season game despite turning in a very solid outing, previously losing a 1–0 game to Pittsburgh and a 3–2 game to Minnesota (in which two of the three runs were unearned) along with the 2–1 loss in this game. He would later add another hard-luck World Series loss four years later despite another stellar outing giving up one earned run and four hits in seven innings.

In what proved to be his last start for the Blue Jays after nine years, Key recorded his first victory in the postseason since he won Game 3 of the 1989 ALCS.

===Game 5===
Down three games to one and facing elimination, the Braves returned John Smoltz to the mound for Game 5, who was still seeking his first World Series win after three previous solid starts all resulted in no decisions. Toronto countered by returning Jack Morris as starter, as he looked to atone for his postseason struggles and, for a second consecutive year, win the deciding game of the World Series.

Although Atlanta&#x27;s situation was dire, it was not impossible for them to come back as several teams in the past had done so. The most recent example had been in 1985, when the Kansas City Royals rallied from a 3-1 deficit to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. In fact, Braves third baseman Terry Pendleton had been a member of that Cardinals team and met with his teammates before the game to remind them of the possibility that they might come back and win the series.

Entering the night, the middle of the Braves&#x27; lineup, which consisted that evening of Pendleton hitting third, David Justice fourth, and Lonnie Smith fifth, had been struggling with the rest of the team when it came to producing hits and scoring runs. In fact, none of the batters hitting in those three slots (Pendleton, Justice, Smith, or Sid Bream who had hit fifth in the first two games in Atlanta) had recorded an extra base hit. The Braves took care of that statistic quickly.

Otis Nixon led the game off for the Braves with a ground rule double due to fan interference. After Deion Sanders struck out, Nixon stole third as Pendleton batted. He then scored as Pendleton responded with a double of his own to right field, scoring the first run of the game and giving Justice a chance to drive in a runner in scoring position. Morris settled down, however, and retired Justice on a strikeout and Smith on a flyball to end the inning.

The Blue Jays tied the game in the bottom of the second. With one out, John Olerud singled and Candy Maldonado reached on a walk. Smoltz struck out Kelly Gruber for the second out, but Pat Borders responded with a double. The slow-footed Olerud was sent home on the play and the throw to the plate was wide, which enabled him to score and put Maldonado on third with the lead run. Manuel Lee ended the threat, however, by lining out to Pendleton.

The fourth inning saw the teams exchange runs again. In the visiting half, Justice led off with a home run for a 2–1 lead. Morris quickly retired Smith and Sid Bream, however, and Borders threw Jeff Blauser out stealing to keep the deficit at one. In the bottom half, Olerud and Maldonado reached base in front of Borders with one out, and as he had in the second inning he drove in Olerud with a single. But once again, the Blue Jays could not score the lead run as Lee grounded into a fielder&#x27;s choice which forced Maldonado out at third and Smoltz struck Devon White out with Borders at second.

Morris started the fifth inning by striking out Damon Berryhill, whose home run in Game 1 saddled him with the loss, and forcing Mark Lemke to ground out. Nixon followed with a single, after which he stole second base. Sanders singled to drive him in and give the Braves the lead, and Pendleton followed with another ground rule double due to fan interference. The call prevented Sanders from scoring on the play, as he was forced to stop at third, and brought Justice back to the plate having already homered an inning earlier. 

Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston, with his ace struggling to record the third out and with one of the Braves&#x27; biggest bats at the plate with a chance to break the game open, decided to go with the same strategy he had when facing Justice with two out in the eighth inning of game three and called for an intentional walk. This brought Smith to the plate, who later said he took the move as an insult and felt that, by opting to pitch to him instead of Justice, that he would be an &quot;easy out&quot;. Indeed, Smith had been struggling in the series to this point; entering Game 5, he had only recorded one hit and was already 0 for 2 this night. His lone hit, however, had come in the aforementioned Game 3 and resulted in an RBI which gave the Braves the lead. 

Smith fouled the first pitch off, then took a ball to even the count. Morris got Smith to foul off the next pitch, leaving him one strike away from escaping the jam and leaving the Braves with the bases loaded. Smith, however, was determined to make the Blue Jays pay for disrespecting his ability and after he fouled off two more pitches, he deposited Morris&#x27; sixth pitch over the wall and into the Atlanta bullpen. The grand slam home run gave the Braves a five-run lead and Gaston finally removed his starter from the game. David Wells retired Bream to end the inning, with the Blue Jays trailing 7–2.

Smoltz pitched into the seventh inning giving up one hit afterward, a single to Dave Winfield in the bottom of the fifth. After walking Lee to lead off the seventh, he was pulled in favor of Mike Stanton, who got White to ground into a fielder&#x27;s choice and then induced a double play from Roberto Alomar to end the threat. The Blue Jays only received one more baserunner the rest of the night as Joe Carter singled, stole second, then advanced to third on a sacrifice fly by Ed Sprague Jr. in the eighth inning but got nothing additional.

Meanwhile, the Toronto relief corps of Wells, Mike Timlin, and Mark Eichhorn managed to keep the Braves in check for the remainder of the game. Atlanta threatened one more time in the ninth with one out as Lemke, Nixon, and Sanders all reached base, but Todd Stottlemyre induced a fly ball out to Maldonado off the bat of Pendleton and Lemke was thrown out trying to score.

Smoltz took the win, his first ever World Series victory, with Stanton getting the save and Morris taking his second loss. Morris would not pitch another postseason game after this, with Smith being the last batter he would face in the postseason. With Smoltz and Morris earning the decisions, this was, to date, the last World Series game in which both the winning and losing pitcher were later inducted into the Hall of Fame until Game 7 of the 2001 World Series (Randy Johnson and Mariano Rivera were the pitchers of record).
Atlanta&#x27;s offensive outburst ensured the series would return to the United States for at least one more game and dashed the Blue Jays&#x27; hopes of clinching the World Series at home on Canadian soil. The Braves would return home looking to force a second straight Game 7 of the World Series, and potentially supplant the 1985 Kansas City Royals as the most recent team to come back from 3-1 down to win the World Series.

Smoltz&#x27;s win in Game 5 was the first of only two World Series wins he recorded in his Hall of Fame career. After recording three no decisions in as many starts (Games 4 and 7 in 1991 and Game 2 in this series), Smoltz would go another four years before winning another World Series game before winning Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. His overall record in World Series play was 2-2, despite a track record of seven quality starts out of eight. He lost Game 5 in 1996, 1-0 (the one run was unearned) and Game 4 in 1999. Smoltz&#x27;s only other World Series start was in the 1995 World Series and this was his only poor start in a World Series, but this one also resulted in a no decision in Game 3 after the Braves rallied to force extra innings.

Morris, meanwhile, continued his struggles in the 1992 postseason. In four total appearances, Morris allowed a total of 19 runs and went 0–3 with an ERA above 7.00. In the World Series alone, his ERA was 8.44, over seven runs higher than his performance the year before when he recorded a 1.17 ERA. Game 5 would be his last postseason appearance for his career; Morris was injured toward the end of the following season and did not pitch in the postseason. He would retire from baseball in 1995.

Smith&#x27;s grand slam was the first in a World Series since 1988, when Jose Canseco hit one in the Oakland Athletics&#x27; eventual 5–4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Smith became the first player to hit one for the winning team since Kent Hrbek did so in Game 6 of the 1987 World Series for the Minnesota Twins, and was the last for a player on the visiting team until Addison Russell did so in Game 6 of the 2016 World Series for the Chicago Cubs.

===Game 6===

The Braves returned home for Game 6 having staved off elimination for one more day. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays entered the game with their second chance at clinching the series and becoming the first Canadian team to win the World Series. 

The Braves gave the start to Steve Avery for Game 6, as they had done in 1991; Avery took the loss after Jeff Reardon gave up the winning hit to Candy Maldonado in Game 3, as he had allowed Roberto Alomar, who scored the winning run, to reach base. Avery had yet to win a World Series game in what was now his fourth try. 

David Cone, meanwhile, returned to the mound for the Blue Jays in Game 6. He had failed to get out of the fifth inning in his previous start in Game 2, giving up all four runs the Braves scored (three of which were earned). He had been bailed out, however, when Ed Sprague&#x27;s late heroics gave the Blue Jays the win. Since the game was back under National League rules, Toronto manager Cito Gaston went back to his Game 1 lineup. Dave Winfield started the game in his natural position of right field, while Joe Carter spelled John Olerud at first base. 

The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the top of the first. Devon White led off with a single, then stole second base. He advanced to third on a groundout by Alomar, and Carter followed with a fly ball to right that David Justice could not field cleanly. White scored and Carter ended up on second. Avery then walked Winfield and got Candy Maldonado to hit a ground ball to the left side. The Braves only managed to get Winfield out, as Carter advanced to third. A Kelly Gruber groundout ended the inning, stranding Carter ninety feet from home.

The first scoring chance for the Braves came in the second. After Sid Bream drew a walk to lead off the inning, Jeff Blauser followed with a single. Damon Berryhill then flew out to White, with the fly ball deep enough to allow the slow-footed Bream to reach third. Cone retired Mark Lemke on a fly out, then struck out Avery to end the threat and keep the Braves off the scoreboard.

In the third, the Blue Jays again had a chance to score but did not take advantage. With one out, Alomar singled and stole second. Carter grounded out to Bream, which advanced Alomar to third. But as in the first, Avery got out of trouble as Winfield flew out to end the inning. In the home half of the inning, Atlanta managed to tie the game. A one out double by Deion Sanders was followed by him stealing third, and Terry Pendleton scored Sanders on a sacrifice fly to tie the score.

Toronto went back to work in the fourth. Maldonado led off with a home run, and with one out Pat Borders doubled. After Avery struck out Manuel Lee, he walked Cone to keep the inning going. White followed with a single and Borders attempted to score from second. The throw from Sanders beat him to the plate, however, and the Blue Jays only managed the one run. Avery left the game after the inning.

After the Braves went down in order in the bottom of the fourth, the Blue Jays had another chance to add to the lead as Carter doubled off of Pete Smith in the top of the fifth. Again, they left him in scoring position as Smith got Winfield and Maldonado out. The Braves tried to rally against Cone in the last half of the inning, with Lemke drawing a walk to start. Cone got the next two outs, but Sanders singled and stole second to put the go-ahead run in scoring position. Pendleton, however, struck out to end the frame.

After neither team got a runner past first base in the sixth or seventh innings, the Blue Jays tried again to score an insurance run in the eighth. Mike Stanton gave up a single to Maldonado, who advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Gruber. Borders was then walked intentionally, and Lee popped out for the second out. Stanton then got pinch hitter Derek Bell to ground out, leaving the Blue Jays with another runner stranded in scoring position. Stanton came back out for the ninth, but after he gave up a double to Carter, Mark Wohlers entered the game and retired Winfield. The Braves bullpen had pitched five scoreless innings to keep the score at 2-1 entering the bottom of the ninth, where they would need to score at least one run to keep their season alive. The bottom of the order would be due up against Blue Jays closer Tom Henke.

Entering the game, the Blue Jays bullpen had not allowed a run all series against the Braves, with the streak continuing with two combined innings of work by Todd Stottlemyre and David Wells. Henke had already converted two save opportunities, saving Game 2 for Duane Ward and Game 4 for Jimmy Key. The Toronto bullpen had also converted every save opportunity it had been presented with, with their last blown save coming in the previous year&#x27;s ALCS when Mike Timlin failed to hold a 5-4 lead in the Blue Jays&#x27; Game 5 loss to the eventual World Series champion Minnesota Twins that ended their season. Henke had already saved a total of five games across both the World Series and ALCS.

Blauser led off the inning with a single and, with Berryhill up, Cox wanted to move the runner into scoring position. Although Berryhill had not recorded a sacrifice bunt the entire season, and had been unsuccessful in his one attempt in the series in Game 4, he did so this time and advanced Blauser to second. Lemke was called back to the dugout in favor of Lonnie Smith, whose heroics in Game 5 brought the Braves back to Atlanta for at least one more game. After falling behind 0-2, Smith fought back to draw a walk and put the potential game winning run on base with one out.

With the pitcher&#x27;s spot now due, Cox decided to call on another one of his postseason heroes to pinch hit for Wohlers. After recording the game and series winning hit against the Pirates in the NLCS, Francisco Cabrera had yet to make an appearance in the World Series before Cox sent him up to pinch hit. On a 2-2 count, Cabrera hit a sharp liner to left field to Maldonado. However, Maldonado temporarily lost sight of the ball and he had to leap to catch it at the last second. 

Otis Nixon then stepped to the plate with the Braves one out away from a second consecutive World Series defeat, needing a hit to extend the game. Down to his final strike, Nixon lined a single to left field. Maldonado fielded the ball as Blauser rounded third, but made a wild throw that sailed over Borders and into the netting behind the backstop. Blauser scored and Smith and Nixon advanced a base on the error. Ron Gant, who had replaced Sanders earlier when he left the game due to an injury, came up with a chance to win the game with a hit, but Henke retired him on a fly ball to end the inning and keep the score tied.

The Braves sent out Charlie Leibrandt to make his first appearance of the World Series against the middle of the Blue Jays&#x27; lineup in the top of the tenth. He retired Maldonado to start the inning, and then after he gave up a single to Gruber he set down Borders on a fly ball and Pat Tabler on a line drive back to the mound. Henke took the mound to face Pendleton and retired him on a groundout to start the Braves&#x27; half of the tenth. With two left-handed batters due up in Justice and Bream, Gaston brought in the veteran Key to make his second appearance of the series; he retired both men to keep the game tied. 

The Braves began the eleventh with action in their bullpen as the right-handed Reardon, who had not pitched since he cost Avery the win in Game 3, was loosening up. Leibrandt, a left-gander, would be facing Key and two switch-hitters in White and Alomar, but if the inning was to extend beyond them, matchups with the power hitting Carter and struggling Winfield, both righties, loomed. 

After retiring Key to start the inning, Leibrandt got ahead of White 1-2. However, the next pitch struck White, and Alomar followed with a single to move him into scoring position. With Carter now the batter, the lead run at second base, and Reardon having been warmed up for some time, CBS analyst Tim McCarver remarked on the broadcast that he believed Cox would come out to remove the veteran starter in favor of his struggling closer. Cox chose to stand pat, however, and Leibrandt managed to retire Carter on a deep fly to center field for the second out. 

Winfield, to this point hitless in four at bats, was the next batter. He had not hit well in the series to this point, and had also struggled in his only other appearance in the World Series, hitting just .045 for the Yankees in 1981. However, he had faced Leibrandt many times when he pitched for the Kansas City Royals in the 1980s and had recorded a .302 batting average against him with four home runs. On the sixth pitch of the at-bat, Winfield hit a line drive that dropped into left field. White scored from second, and Alomar followed closely behind as the ball took a strange hop off of the left field corner and Gant could not field it cleanly. It was Winfield&#x27;s first career World Series extra-base hit and made the score 4-2. The Braves got out of the inning with no further damage though as Maldonado popped out.

For the second consecutive year in the World Series, Leibrandt had given up a go-ahead extra base hit in extra innings in Game 6. In 1991, he had allowed the game-winning home run to Kirby Puckett in the eleventh inning that allowed the Twins to tie the series and force the deciding seventh game that they would eventually win. Unlike that situation, the Braves would get one more at bat to try and rally. And as they had in the bottom of the ninth inning of this game, the bottom third of the Atlanta batting order would be due up. 

Blauser led off the bottom of the eleventh by singling off of Key. On the very next pitch, Key got Berryhill to hit what should have been a double play ball toward veteran shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who had entered the game as a defensive replacement in the tenth. At the last moment, however, the ball took a strange hop and bounced off of Griffin&#x27;s glove, which allowed Blauser to advance to third base and putting the tying run on first with nobody out. Cox then called for a pinch runner, but with a relatively thin bench left at his disposal he sent out Game 5 winning pitcher John Smoltz to take Berryhill&#x27;s position. The next batter was Rafael Belliard, who had replaced Lemke at second base in the tenth inning and who also had yet to record a hit in the series to this point. Cox called for a sacrifice bunt to move Smoltz into scoring position, which he did successfully. 

With the pitcher&#x27;s spot up next, Cox sent pinch hitter Brian Hunter up to try and drive the runners home with a hit. On the second pitch of the at-bat, Hunter hit the ball to the right side of the infield, which Carter fielded and stepped on the bag for the putout. The runners advanced, with Blauser scoring, but the Braves were still behind by one run and were once again down to their last out. With Nixon, who had driven in the tying run in the ninth after being down to his final strike, stepping up with another chance to tie the game, Gaston visited the mound to have a conference with his infielders.

During the course of the meeting at the mound, Gaston decided to pull Key from the game and hand the ball to the right-handed Timlin, who had thrown one scoreless inning in the Blue Jays’ Game 5 loss. The possibility of Nixon trying to beat out a bunt for a base hit was also discussed, and Timlin was advised by Carter to “be careful” and watch for the bunt. With Timlin coming in, the switch-hitting Nixon would be forced to bat left-handed. Although he had a higher average from the right side of the plate, the left side was closer to the first base line and would allow Nixon to get a quicker start if he decided to try to beat out a bunt. 

On the second pitch of the at-bat, Nixon laid down the expected bunt. The ball rolled to Timlin, who fielded it cleanly and fired it to first base in plenty of time to retire Nixon and clinch the series for the Blue Jays. After the final out was recorded, Timlin asked Carter for the ball so he could commemorate his title winning save. Carter obliged, and gave his pitcher a hug in celebration. Key received his second win of the series, making him and Ward the only two Blue Jay pitchers to record victories during the series (the only other pitcher of record was Jack Morris, who went 0-2 in his two starts). Leibrandt took the loss, his third in as many appearances for the Braves in a World Series.

==Composite box==
1992 World Series (4–2): Toronto Blue Jays (A.L.) over Atlanta Braves (N.L.)

This World Series is notable for being one of the few six-game series in which the winning team was outscored. It happened previously in 1918, 1959, and 1977; later in 1996 and 2003. Seven-game winners were outscored in 1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1991, 1997, and 2002; (equaled in 2016 and 2017).

The Blue Jays became the fourth World Series champion where each of their wins in the Series was by the margin of one run. This also happened in 1915, 1918 and 1972.

==Series Overview &amp; Aftermath==
Game 6 would be both starting pitchers&#x27; last games with their respective teams. Jimmy Key joined the New York Yankees for 1993 and would eventually return to the World Series with them against the Braves in 1996, pitching in two games and, as he had in this series, winning the clinching Game 6. He would retire in 1998 after two seasons with the Baltimore Orioles. Charlie Leibrandt would pitch one more season with the Texas Rangers in 1993, retiring following a 9-10 campaign and a torn rotator cuff. 

Although Mike Timlin pitched in the majors for another sixteen seasons after this, his save in Game 6 was his only career postseason save. He would win three more World Series as a player, one more with the Blue Jays and two with the Boston Red Sox before retiring after the 2008 season. 

With the series win, Gaston became the first African American manager in baseball history to win a World Series. Until Dave Roberts won the 2020 World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers, he was the only one to do so. Dusty Baker joined the club two years later with the Houston Astros.

American League president Dr. Bobby Brown presented the World Series Trophy in the place of the commissioner. Just a month earlier, Fay Vincent was forced to resign and was replaced by Bud Selig on what was originally perceived to be an &quot;interim basis.&quot; Dr. Brown also presented the Blue Jays the trophy in 1993. The last World Series not to be presided over by a commissioner had taken place in 1919. Selig officially became commissioner of baseball in 1998.

The victory marked the first major championship for the city of Toronto since the National Hockey League&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs won the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals.

On January 29, 1995, Deion Sanders while a member of the National Football League&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers participated in Super Bowl XXIX, thus Sanders became the first and to date, only professional athlete to play in both a World Series and Super Bowl.

==Broadcasting==
At 30 years of age, CBS&#x27; Sean McDonough became the youngest man to call all nine innings and games of a World Series while serving as a network television employee. Although Vin Scully and Al Michaels were several years younger when they called their first World Series in 1955 and 1972 respectively, they were products of the broadcasting practice of announcers representing the participating teams calling games, a practice that ended following the 1976 World Series. McDonough&#x27;s record would subsequently be broken by Fox&#x27;s Joe Buck, who at 27 years of age, called the 1996 World Series. Coincidentally, McDonough replaced Buck&#x27;s father, Jack Buck, as CBS&#x27;s lead play-by-play man. Serving as field reporters for CBS&#x27;s coverage were Jim Kaat (in the Braves&#x27; dugout) and Lesley Visser (in the Blue Jays&#x27; dugout). The Series drew an overall Nielsen rating of 20.2, down from the previous year&#x27;s 24.0 but higher than that of any subsequent World Series.

CBS Radio also broadcast the Series nationally, with Vin Scully and Johnny Bench announcing. Locally, the Series was called on WGST-AM in Atlanta by Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren, Ernie Johnson, Joe Simpson, and Don Sutton, and on CJCL-AM in Toronto by Jerry Howarth and Tom Cheek.

<text>The Dumdums (formerly stylised as Dum Dums) were a British guitar-pop band. London-based, they split up in August 2001. The band members were Josh Doyle – vocals and guitar, Steve Clarke – bass and vocals, Stuart &#x27;Baxter&#x27; Wilkinson – drums and vocals.

In their short but successful career their achievements included reaching the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart with four singles (&quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Thoughts&quot;, &quot;You Do Something To Me&quot; and &quot;Army of Two&quot;) and playing at Wembley Stadium with Bon Jovi and at Hyde Park, London with Elton John, Christina Aguilera and Destiny&#x27;s Child. After selling out a final UK tour, they decided to part ways at the peak of their popularity under a shroud of mystery.

Their principal songwriter/lead vocalist Josh Doyle is now resident in Nashville, Tennessee. After years in the musical wilderness he emerged in 2012 to make his network TV debut on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, with his new band and a single &quot;Solarstorms&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine wrote in their 7 November 2012 issue &quot;615 Spotlight&quot; feature, that Doyle &quot;may well be the Next Big Thing on an international level&quot;.

==Career==
Originally formed in 1997, straight out of school, the band spent their early years gigging in small venues and songwriting. They signed a management contract with Modernwood Management, and then signed to Wildstar Records in March 1999. In the same month they went on their first UK tour, supporting fellow Modernwood artist, Nik Kershaw. A more extensive tour in September, supporting My Life Story, followed. It was on this tour that the band began to build up their fanbase, selling a two-track CD known as &quot;The Blue CD&quot; that contained the tracks &quot;Everything&quot; and &quot;Until My Ship Comes In&quot;.

Dum Dums&#x27; debut single, &quot;Everything&quot;, produced by Steve Power was released on 28 February 2000. Accompanied by a video and A-listing on British radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, it reached 21 in the UK Singles Chart.

The second single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Thoughts&quot; was released on 26 June 2000 and reached number 18 in the UK chart.

On 18 September 2000, their debut album, &quot;It Goes Without Saying&quot;, again produced by Power, was released in the UK. It received favourable reviews from the music press, with the band being compared to Green Day, The Police, Blink-182, Elvis Costello and The Jam. The album comprised eleven listed tracks and an unlisted bonus track, revealed as &quot;Setting Sail&quot; in the liner notes.

A third single, &quot;You Do Something To Me&quot; was released a week prior to the album, and this reached number 27. The music video for this song, inspired by Queen&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; promo, featured Doyle and Wilkinson in drag. The song was used as the theme tune to the CBBC show &quot;Xchange&quot;, and they performed the song on the last episode of the series.

They supported Bon Jovi at Wembley Stadium and also performed at Glastonbury, T in the Park, V2000 and several roadshows and outdoor gigs organised by local radio stations. In October they played 22 shows at arenas around the country supporting Robbie Williams. The year ended with another headline tour, with a final gig at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 19 December.

There was also TV exposure on shows such as &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Pepsi Chart&quot;. Doyle also appeared as a panellist on the BBC Two quiz show, &quot;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&quot;.

The final single from their debut album, &quot;Army of Two&quot; was released on 5 February 2001. It reached number 27 in the UK Singles Chart; exactly matching the chart placings of both &quot;You Do Something To Me&quot; and &quot;It Goes Without Saying&quot;. There were three acoustic performances at Tower Records in London, Birmingham and Southampton to promote the release. UK gigs in 2001 mainly consisted of appearances at University Summer Balls. The band also travelled to Germany and Japan for tours with Wheatus and The PeteBest. They entered the Japanese Top 20 with &quot;Everything&quot;.

The band went into the studio on three occasions in 2001, recording demo versions of the songs that would eventually comprise their second album. A session in February resulted in five new tracks being laid down, including &quot;Photographs&quot;, which was played many times on tour in 2000. Another session in April saw ten tracks recorded, and a final session in June, just prior to their Japanese tour, yielded another four tracks.

By mutual agreement the band decided to break up, and announced via their website that their last concert would be at the Greenbelt Festival in August 2001. The set at the last gig included a new song that had been demoed, called &quot;Travelling at Speed&quot;. 12 of the demos were officially released as free downloads in 20003, while seven more tracks leaked over time.

Doyle has had a re-emergence as a US-based singer-songwriter whilst Wilkinson and Clarke formed Rogue States.
The band released b-sides under the title Dumdums in May 2018.

<text>Leonard Dorin Doroftei (, also known as &quot;Leonard Dorin&quot;; born 10 April 1970) is a Romanian 
former boxer, the WBA Lightweight World Champion from 5 January 2002 to 24 October 2003.

==Amateur highlights==
Doroftei took up boxing at the age of 14 at the Ploieşti boxing club. From 1983 to 1984, he won every Romanian national junior title. He went on to win four national senior titles in 1992–1994 and 1997. He won bronze medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In addition, he was declared World Champion in 1995 and European Champion in 1996. His record as an amateur was 239 victories and 15 defeats.

===Olympic results===
1992 (as a Light Welterweight)
* Defeated Edgar Ruiz (Mexico) 24–4
* Defeated Arlo Chavez (Philippines) 15–1
* Defeated Peter Richardson (Great Britain) points
* Lost to Mark Leduc (Canada) 6–32

1996 (as a Lightweight)
* Defeated Julio Mboumba (Gabon) RSC 23 (1:46)
* Defeated Sergey Kopenkin (Kyrgyzstan) 23–1
* Defeated Koba Gogoladze (Georgia) 23–8
* Lost to Hocine Soltani (Algeria) 32–9

==Professional career==

In 1997, Doroftei turned professional, signing with the Canadian club Interbox. Throughout his career, Dorin competed on ESPN, Showtime, and HBO. On 5 January 2002 he won the WBA world lightweight title, winning in a thrilling split decision over Argentinian boxer Raul Horacio Balbi 112–115, 114–113, 115–112. On 31 May the two fought again in Bucharest; this time, Dorin scored a knockdown en route to a clear cut unanimous decision victory, 118–111, 117–112 and 118–110.

A lightweight title unification bout on 17 May 2003 with American boxer Paul Spadafora, the IBF champion, ended in a draw, 114–114, 115–113, 114–115. The bout took place in Spadafora&#x27;s hometown of Pittsburgh, and Dorin was a significant underdog. However, Dorin seemed to control the vast majority of the fight. He got to Spadafora early and often, surprising the champ with his intensity and workrate. Most observers agreed that Dorin had been robbed of a decision he deserved. Unfortunately for both fighters and boxing fans, a rematched never materialized.

On 24 October 2003, Doroftei was to fight a match against Panamanian boxer Miguel Callist. Doroftei had already announced that this would be his last professional match regardless of the result. As it turned out, the match was cancelled after Doroftei exceeded the maximum weight for lightweights at the weigh-in: he was over the weight limit, so he lost his WBA title.

On 24 July 2004, Doroftei lost his undefeated mark when he tried to get the WBC title, getting knocked out with a body shot in two rounds by Arturo Gatti.

==Retirement==
He now resides in Romania with his wife and 3 children and is working as a trainer for boxing prospects. He has his own pub-restaurant in Ploieşti, which is decorated with his photos and memories from his boxing career. In November 2012, he was elected President of Romanian Boxing Federation.

<text>David Charles Hudson (born ) is an Australian musician, entertainer and artist. Hudson is a multi-instrumentalist and was taught to play traditional didgeridoo from an early age. He also plays guitar, kit drums, percussion. He plays traditional music, as well as more ambient music, country-folk, rock, and new age.

== Life and career ==
David Charles Hudson was born in the early 1960s and is a descendant of the Ewamin-Western Yalanji peoples of the western Far North Queensland region. He explained &quot;I grew up in a household with uncles and aunts who painted and carved. I was taught traditional stories, so I was painting stories, and I learned what this line represents and this dot represents.&quot; He was also taught to play traditional didgeridoo. Hudson finished secondary schooling in 1979, then attended a teachers&#x27; college and was qualified as a recreation officer. According to Hudson &quot;the majority of indigenous teenagers left school in year 10 and followed their fathers and grandfathers to work on railways, in construction or on cane fields.&quot;

In 1987 Hudson, his wife Cindy Judd, and other partners, established the Tjapukai Dance Theatre and the related Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park in Kuranda. Hudson, as a dancer and musician, toured with Greek-American musician, Yanni, from 1996 to 2005 and appears on the artist&#x27;s albums, &quot;Tribute&quot; (November 1997), &quot;Ethnicity&quot; (February 2003) and &quot;Yanni Live! The Concert Event&quot; (August 2006). From 1997 to 2012 Hudson was General Manager of the Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park.

Hudson worked on the film &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; and played the Bisonman.

In 2013, Hudson consulted for Dreamworld on the Gold Coast as cultural advisor, choreographer and script writer.

On 26 March 2014 Hudson was given an Honorary Doctorate from James Cook University, Cairns for his outstanding service and distinguished public contribution to the Queensland community. Exceptional service to the University through his willingness to assist students and researchers to obtain and interpret cultural knowledge and Exceptional contributions beyond expectations of his field of endeavour, as a role model who has influenced the thinking and general well-being of humanity.

In October 2014 Hudson gave a TEDx talk titled &quot;Have Didge will Travel&quot; at TEDxJCUCairns. Hudson&#x27;s talk explains how a boy once classified by the Government as fauna, grew up and is now able to spread a positive message about Aboriginal culture, especially through his passion for the didgeridoo.

Hudson continues to undertake motivational speaking, cultural workshops, original paintings and making customised didgeridoos.

In April 2018 Hudson performed at the official opening of the Sir John Monash Centre at Villers-Bretonneux in France. He presented the didgeridoo he had made for the occasion to Prime Minister Turnbull for inclusion in the museum.

<text>Welfare reforms are changes in the operation of a given welfare system aimed at improving the efficiency, equity, and administration of government assistance programs. Reform programs may have a various aims; sometimes the focus is on reducing the number of individuals receiving government assistance and welfare system expenditure, and at other times reforms may aim to ensure greater fairness, effectiveness, and allocation of welfare for those in need. Classical liberals, neoliberals, right-wing libertarians, and conservatives generally argue that welfare and other tax-funded services reduce incentives to work, exacerbate the free-rider problem, and intensify poverty. On the other hand, in their criticism of capitalism, both social democrats and other socialists generally criticize welfare reforms that minimize the public safety net and strengthens the capitalist economic system. Welfare reform is constantly debated because of the varying opinions on a government&#x27;s need to balance providing guaranteed welfare benefits and promoting self-sufficiency.

From the 1970s, welfare systems came under greater scrutiny around the world. Demographic changes such as the post-war &quot;baby boom&quot; and the subsequent &quot;baby bust&quot;, coupled with economic shifts such as the 1970 oil shocks, led to aging populations, a dwindling workforce, and increased dependency on social welfare systems, which inevitably brought up the issue of welfare reform. U.S. systems primarily focused on reducing poor single parents&#x27; need for welfare assistance through employment incentives. The United Kingdom focused primarily on reducing general unemployment through the New Deal introduced by the New Labour government in the 1990s. The Netherlands emphasized reforming disability programs, and Latin America focused primarily on pension reforms.

== History ==

Many historians trace the beginnings of contemporary welfare in Europe and America to Germany&#x27;s health insurance laws introduced in the late 19th century. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced government healthcare and approved the 1883 Health Insurance Act, which was the first to introduce compulsory government-monitored health insurance. The German legislation ensured contributory retirement and disability benefits. Participation became mandatory.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the Great Depression led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s introduction of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program and the Social Security Program through the Social Security Act, which created a public welfare system to provide assistance to various dependent persons in need. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson introduced pieces of legislation collectively known as the War on Poverty in response to a persistently high poverty rate of approximately 20%. This initiative funded welfare programs such as Social Security, Food Stamps, Job Corps, and Head Start. The War on Poverty included new federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which provided seniors, low-income individuals, and other disadvantaged groups with health insurance. Furthermore, the U.S. Government began providing direct assistance to school districts, passed sweeping environmental protections, instituted urban renewal projects, furthered civil rights protections, and expanded funding for the arts and humanities.

President Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration proposed the 1969 Family Assistance Plan, which instituted a work requirement for all welfare recipients except mothers with children under three years of age. This requirement was removed in 1972 amidst criticism from liberals that the plan provided too little support and having excessively stringent work requirements. Ultimately, the Nixon Administration presided over the continued expansion of welfare programs, however the Family Assistance Plan facilitated greater debate over the state of the welfare system and began the rhetoric for anti-welfare sentiment. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan cut spending for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, and allowed states to require welfare recipients to participate in workfare programs. Charles Murray&#x27;s book &quot;Losing Ground&quot; (1984) argued that the welfare state actually harms the poor, especially single-parent families, by making them increasingly dependent on the government, and discouraging them from working. Murray proposed that current welfare programs be replaced by short-term local programs.
In his 1992 presidential campaign, the Democratic candidate Bill Clinton running as a New Democrat promised to &quot;end welfare as we have come to know it&quot;. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act was crafted as a response to the perceived failings of AFDC. Concerns about AFDC had started in the 1960s, at the same time when anti-poverty solutions and programs were being debated and created. Some of these concerns included that it: caused family dysfunction among the poor (especially among poor black families as a result of the Moynihan Report), discouraged marriage and promoted single-motherhood, and discouraged poor women from seeking employment by encouraging dependency on government aid. The 1980s concerns about the budget and spending on welfare also intensified with the growth of AFDC caseloads. Concerns about fraudulent welfare claims, dependency, and misuse by recipients created the stereotypical trope of the &quot;welfare queen&quot;. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, growing public concern about out-of-wedlock births and teen pregnancy also fueled concern towards AFDC. Despite the public and political concerns, &quot;sociologists, poverty analysts, and ethnographers have demonstrated that AFDC itself had little impact on women’s marital or childbearing decisions and the program acted for most recipients as a supplement to earnings or as a temporary source of support between periods of employment.&quot;

In addition to public and political perception of welfare, also important to welfare reform is the drastic change in women&#x27;s labor market participation since ADC was first enacted. By the 1990s it was more common for women to engage in waged work, and this change contributed to the expectation that women receiving welfare should be required to do work outside the home. The economic and social context of the labor market had changed as well. Jobs that provided a steady and livable family wage had declined over the decades, the growth and expansion of the low-wage labor market had created jobs that provided little economic security or chance for upward economic mobility. The idea of the work-first approach to work requirements prioritized getting recipients to quickly enter the job market, with the work programs offered focusing on job readiness and immediate job placement at the first available job. These concerns about the women receiving AFDC and the impact of the program on marriage and motherhood, as well as the increased demand for low-wage, low-skilled workers in the job market and the expectation for women to participate in the labor-market provide the context for the 1996 welfare reform act. The 1996 PRWORA ended AFDC and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The most significant change from AFDC to TANF is the end to an individual entitlement for poor families to receive federal aid.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== New Deal ====
In recent years reform of the welfare system in Britain began with the introduction of the New Deal programme, which was introduced by the Labour Party government under Tony Blair in 1997. The aim of this programme was to increase employment through requiring that recipients make serious efforts to seek employment. The Labour Party also introduced a system of tax credits for low-income workers.

==== Welfare Reform Act 2007 ====

The Welfare Reform Act 2007 provides for &quot;an employment and support allowance, a contributory allowance, [and] an income-based allowance&quot;. The objectives of the Welfare Reform Act of 2007 were to increase the employment rate to 80% from 75%, to assist 300,000 single parents find employment, to increase the number of workers over 50 by 1 million, and to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefits by 2 million.

==== Welfare Reform Act 2009 ====

This welfare reform proposed an increase of personal responsibility within the welfare system. The reform eliminated Income support, and allocated funds over to the Jobseeker&#x27;s allowance, to encourage employment. It also encouraged increased parental responsibility by amending child support laws, and requiring births be registered jointly by both parents.

==== Welfare Reform Act 2012 ====

This welfare reform proposed changes to the Housing Benefit, which reduced the benefit paid to recipients depending on the size of their living space. This act got the nickname of the &quot;Bedroom Tax&quot;. from the media. It was stated that similarly to other welfare reforms, this act would reduce welfare dependency.

=== France ===
Beginning in the mid-1970s, a deficit in the social insurance program began to appear. The deficit saw peaks at 27.75% of the social insurance budget in 1992. This led to a major push by the government to cut back spending in the welfare program. By the end of the 1990s the deficit had been almost completely eradicated. The often large deficits that the program has endured has led to a tremendous amount of opposition to the program as it stands. In February 2020, a pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French constitution.

=== Brazil ===
During the 2015–2018 Brazilian economic crisis, there was both economic and political turmoil. President Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached and replaced by President Michel Temer, strived to expand the social welfare program Bolsa Família instated by her predecessor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As a social democrat, Rousseff pledged that &quot;Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility.&quot; When Michel Temer took office, to cope with the severe economic recession, he proposed social welfare reforms to change labor rules and the social security pension system. Temer&#x27;s plan included limiting pension benefits and raising the retirement age in order to save money and fix the economy. Additionally, under his reform, companies have greater power to require longer work days and use part-time workers. In response to this reform, labor unions, rural workers, and government employees held protests all over Brazil. The vote to approve the pension reform was first suspended until February 2018, and now has been further postponed as a campaign issue in this year&#x27;s election. Temer&#x27;s critics believe that the reason for the postponed reform is its vast public disapproval.

=== India ===
India has taken substantial strides toward dramatically reforming its welfare architecture over the last five years especially, ranging from direct benefit transfers (DBT), Ayushman Bharat, income support (PM-Kisan), and the implementation of the 14th Finance Commission recommendations; however, crucial unanswered and hotly debated concerns regarding the welfare state&#x27;s architecture lie under these changes. The issues are concentrated on centralisation and the ability of different levels of government to deliver. The new government&#x27;s welfare policy would inevitably have to address these issues, as well as the opportunities and threats they raise. The new government&#x27;s ability to manage this complexity would decide its ability to provide high-quality public services to India&#x27;s poorest citizens. But the trend of introducing welfare reforms has not been introduced lately as some schemes were brought into action since the 1960s. Hence, giving an insight in India&#x27;s historical background of welfare schemes is essential to form the base layer for further examples.

==== India&#x27;s banks nationalized ====
Indira Gandhi, who was both Prime Minister and Finance Minister in charge, agreed to nationalize 14 of the country&#x27;s largest private banks on 19 July 1969. In 1955, with Imperial Bank having already been nationalized and renamed State Bank of India, this decision in 1969, effectively placed 80 percent of banking assets under state control. Nationalization of banks was defined as the &quot;single most significant economic decision taken by any government since 1947&quot; in the third volume of the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s history. The aim of nationalizing banks was to align the banking sector with the Indian government&#x27;s post-independence socialist goals. According to the RBI&#x27;s records, the proposal to nationalize banks and insurance companies was first proposed in a report by the All India Congress Committee in 1948.

Nationalization of banks is perhaps the most significant systemic change in the financial sector in India&#x27;s post-independence period. Bank nationalization, according to the second volume of the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s official history after 1947, was the single most critical economic policy decision made by any government. After 1967, banks were not lending to agriculture nor lending enough to industries making these sectors face heavy crisis. There has long been a perception that Indian banks are unwilling to lend money especially to agriculture sector.  Furthermore, since private banks were controlled by large industrialists, they often ended up lending to themselves. The top bank directors have held directorships in a variety of other sectors, creating a conflict of interest. Aside from political and economic considerations, there were also banking considerations. Some included, examining the escalating economic crisis that afflicted the 1960s. Removing the few&#x27;s monopoly in the banking sector. Ensuring adequate credit for agriculture, small businesses, and exports. Professionalizing the banking sector&#x27;s management. Encouraging new business owners and enhancing and developing India&#x27;s rural areas. This action resulted in a significant rise in bank deposits and investment and this transition had a long-term effect on the success of small-scale industries and agriculture. It has also resulted in increased bank penetration in rural India.

==== Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) ====

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched this financial inclusion programme in the year 2014 as his welcome move. It aims at laying the groundwork for the construction of the infrastructure needed to implement direct cash transfers across the region. The Jan Dhan Yojana, which pledges each Indian household a bank account, insurance coverage, and overdraft facility over the next two years, would finally give the government the opportunity to implement a universal basic income transfer to all people, reshaping the country&#x27;s leaky affluent economy and even the dysfunctional welfare system. Until now, the scheme hasn&#x27;t proved much beneficial in organising the welfare system of India and the country still awaits it advantages.

==== Technology, income support, citizens and bureaucracy ====
For the last decade, technology has been at the forefront of the welfare reform project. When the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) first came to power in 2014, it adopted Aadhar (national document) and DBT (direct benefit transfers) systems (effort and rapid progress) and just 28 schemes used DBT to pass funds in March 2014 but by May 2019 it had risen to over 400. With the introduction of PM-Kisan in January 2019, India made its first national attempt to implement a basic income support programme using the DBT architecture; however, putting too much emphasis on technology to enforce DBT has revealed three major flaws in the system: the last-mile challenge, a lack of reliable data to identify beneficiaries, and citizen alienation. The desire to reduce payment leakage and increase performance is a key reason for scaling DBT and shifting toward direct cash transfers by income support programmes. In arguing for a Universal Basic Income (UBI), the 2017 Economic Survey claimed that income transfers have the ability to reduce bureaucratic layers by transferring money directly into beneficiary accounts. This will minimise corruption by reducing discretion and simplifying monitoring.

2020s research show that having the DBT architecture correct necessitates substantial bureaucratic interference, rather than reducing it. Local bureaucrats are important to DBT, from opening accounts to fostering financial literacy and facilitating bank transactions. Muralidharan et al. recently completed a Niti Aayog-commissioned process monitoring exercise by using DBT to access the Public Distribution System scheme in three Union Territories (Chandigarh, Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli, and Puducherry). Muralidharan et al. discovered that 20% of beneficiaries acknowledged not receiving payment, despite official records indicating a transfer rate of failure of less than 1%. The study attributes the difference to a lack of beneficiary awareness and knowledge of transactions, as well as administrative problems such as amount paid into bank accounts that recipients may not have access to, or processing errors.

Once a new welfare reform system in inculcated into the system, it faces a lot of challenges and as by its very nature, technology produces centralized networks that are distant and perplexing for average people, in ways similar to the unpleasant daily interactions readers of this document have had with call centre agents. When citizens&#x27; rights are denied, digital welfare programmes run the risk of closing off spaces for citizens to petition, protest, and seek transparency and the point being made here is not to argue against efficiency of administration. Therefore, a balance must be struck between centralized power for performance and decentralized, citizen-centric governance for responsiveness.

=== Canada ===

In 1945, the White Paper on Employment and Income was introduced by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. At this time, King had already begun to change and remove many of the previous policies for state intervention that were established during the world war periods. This paper focused on a new Keynesian approach to economic management, such as full employment and high income. Full employment was to be mainly achieved through assistance to private enterprises. In this regard, King deviated from the idea of expanding welfare measures and wanted to instead focus on liberal corporatism. However, despite this new approach, the King government did eventually go on to expand some social insurance and health measures.

Between 1951 and 1952 there were several key welfare reforms in Canada. Under then Prime Minister, Louis St. Laurent, an amendment to the Indian Act was made in 1951, to allow Indigenous people to apply for provincial social welfare for the first time. This permitted Indigenous people to collect cash benefits. However, these changes to the Indian Act also gave more powers to the provinces over the lives of Indigenous people. Under this amendment, the provinces were permitted to take Indigenous children under their care which facilitated the beginning of a period in the 1960s where many Indigenous children were forcibly taken from their homes and enrolled into residential schools, or placed with other families. Prime Minister St. Laurent also adopted universal old-age pensions for Canadians over 70, and means-test old age security for Canadians between 65 and 70 in the period of 1951 to 1952. In 1956, the Unemployment Assistance Act was also adopted under St. Laurent due to increasing pressure from the provinces over high unemployment rates.

During the beginning of the 1960s, the country saw the introduction of three key pieces of legislation of the modern Canadian welfare state. In 1964, under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, the National Housing Act was amended significantly to allow for federal loans to the provinces for the establishment of public housing, up to 90% of the cost of construction. Following this development, in 1965 the Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan were established as a national compulsory contributory pension plan. In 1966, the Canada Assistance Plan was made to merge the Unemployment Assistance Act with other assistance plans such as those for the physically disabled and single parents. The Canadian Assistance plan also established a federal cost-sharing mechanism for social service such as a national healthcare system. The provinces became responsible for administering the new national healthcare systems within their own jurisdictions.

In 1971, under the government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Unemployment Insurance coverage was expanded to an extent that it became almost universal. At this point, the only people who were excluded from coverage were the self-employed, people over the age of 70, and people who did not earn the minimum weekly earnings of 20% of the maximum weekly insurable earnings. One of the main goals was to &quot;provide adequate income support for all persons experiencing temporary earnings interruptions&quot;. This new amendment liberalized the former system. The National Housing Act was also expanded under Trudeau to cover co-operative and non-profit assistance. In 1978, for the first time the tax system was also used to provide Canadians with a child tax credit. The 1970s in Canada saw economic stagnation and rising inflation. This led to a new conservative political approach that rejected the former Keynesian beliefs held by Prime Ministers such as Mackenzie King. This decade favoured politicians who promised decreasing government expenditure on social programs. During this time unemployment was used strategically to reduce wage increases and inflation. In 1977, the Established Programs Financing and Fiscal Arrangements Act &quot;replaced the previous federal–provincial cost-sharing arrangements, which were conditional grants, with a formula that increased federal contributions to provincial programs according to increases in gross national product&quot;. Arguably this decade saw the beginning of the decline of the Canadian welfare state.

In 1989 the federal Family Allowance was terminated. As a result of similar measures such as reductions and terminations of welfare programs, the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in charity based institutions such as food banks and emergency shelters. This was due to the lack of government-funded facilities, and the growth of unemployment and housing costs. In 1995, under the government of Jean Chrétien, the Canada Assistance Plan was terminated. It was a federal-provincial cost sharing agreement. In 1996 it was replaced by the Canada Health and Social Transfer which provided funds to provinces and territories to support health care, post-secondary education, social assistance and social services. The Canada Health and Social Transfer &quot;was a combination of the 1977 tax transfer and a cash transfer, and the total was allocated on an equal per capita basis&quot;. Following the adoption of this plan, many provinces adopted workfare policies which placed pressure on those who were deemed employable to find employment and leave welfare. This included single parents and people with addictions. In keeping with the trend of this decade, the federal government also raised the requirements for unemployment insurance to require 30% more hours worked to qualify. In 1997, the Social Union Framework Agreement was signed by the Federal government and every province except Québec. This agreement helped to increase funds once again in the areas of health care, social assistance, and social services under a neoliberal approach.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper focused his welfare policies mainly on reducing the public service and supporting families. To achieve this, in 2006 Harper passed the Universal Child Care Benefit. This benefit provided $100 a month per child to households caring for a child under the age of six. This program is similar to the previous Family Allowance that was terminated. In 2022, under the current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the federal government finalized an agreement with all the provinces and one territory for a publicly funded, Canada-wide system of childcare. Trudeau promised to deliver $10 a day daycare for families in Canada.

In 2023, the Future Pensions Act came into effect revising the Dutch pension system.

<text>Club Atlético Boca Juniors (), more commonly referred to as simply Boca Juniors, is an Argentine professional sports club based in La Boca, a neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club is best known for its men&#x27;s professional football team which, since its promotion in 1913, has always played in the Argentine Primera División. The team has won 74 official titles, the most by any Argentine club. National titles won by Boca Juniors include 35 Primera División championships, and 17 domestic cups. Boca Juniors also owns an honorary title awarded by the Argentine Football Association for their successful tour of Europe in 1925.

Internationally, Boca Juniors has won 22 major titles, with 18 organised by CONMEBOL and the rest organised jointly by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations. Consequently, Boca is ranked third in the world in terms of number of complete international titles, after Real Madrid (34) and Egyptian side Al Ahly (26). Boca Juniors&#x27; international achievements also include one Tie Cup, one Copa de Honor Cousenier, and two Copa Escobar-Gerona, organized jointly by AFA and AUF together. Their success usually has the Boca Juniors ranked among the IFFHS&#x27;s Club World Ranking Top 25, which they have reached the top position six times (mostly during the coaching tenure of Carlos Bianchi). Boca was named by the IFFHS as the top South American club of the first decade of the 21st century (2001–2010). It was designated by FIFA as the joint twelfth-best Club of the Century, in December 2000, occupying the same place as Liverpool of England, Internazionale of Italy, and Benfica of Portugal, among others.

Boca Juniors has a fierce rivalry with River Plate, and matches between them are known as the Superclásico. It is the most heated rivalry in Argentina and one of the biggest in the world, as the clubs are the two most popular in the country. Boca&#x27;s home stadium is the Estadio Alberto J. Armando, better known colloquially as &quot;La Bombonera&quot;. The youth academy has produced many Argentine internationals who have played or are playing for top European clubs, such as Oscar Ruggeri, Sebastián Battaglia, Nicolás Burdisso, Carlos Tevez, Éver Banega, Fernando Gago, Leandro Paredes, and Nahuel Molina.

In addition to men&#x27;s football, Boca Juniors has professional women&#x27;s football and basketball teams. Other (amateur) activities held in the club are: bocce, boxing, chess, field hockey, futsal, artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, handball, martial arts (judo, karate, and taekwondo), swimming, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling. As of January 2023, Boca Juniors ranked first among the clubs with the most members in Argentina, with 315,879.

==History==

On 3 April 1905, a group of Italian boys (more specifically from Genoa) met in order to find a club. The house where the meeting was arranged was Esteban Baglietto&#x27;s and the other four people who attended were Alfredo Scarpatti, Santiago Sana and brothers Juan Farenga and Teodoro Farenga .
Other important founding members include Arturo Penney, Marcelino Vergara, Luis Cerezo, Adolfo Taggio, Giovanelli, Donato Abbatángelo, and Bertolini.

In 1913, Boca was promoted to Primera División after some previous failed attempts. This was possible when the Argentine Association decided to increase the number of teams in the league from 6 to 15.

In 1925, Boca made its first trip to Europe to play in Spain, Germany and France. The squad played a total of 19 games, winning 15 of them. For that reason Boca was declared &quot;Campeón de Honor&quot; (Champion of Honour) by the Association.

During successive years, Boca consolidated as one of the most popular teams of Argentina, with a huge number of fans not only in the country but worldwide.

==Kit and badge==
According to the club&#x27;s official site, the original jersey colour was a white shirt with thin black vertical stripes, being then replaced by a light blue shirt and then another striped jersey before adopting the definitive blue and gold. Nevertheless, another version states that Boca Juniors&#x27; first jersey was pink, although it has been questioned by some journalists and historians who state that Boca, most probably, never wore a pink jersey, by pointing out the lack of any solid evidence and how this version stems from, and is only supported on, flawed testimonies.

Legend has it that in 1906, Boca played Nottingham de Almagro. Both teams wore such similar shirts that the match was played to decide which team would get to keep it. Boca lost, and decided to adopt the colors of the flag of the first boat to sail into the port at La Boca. This proved to be a Swedish ship, therefore the yellow and blue of the Swedish flag were adopted as the new team colours. The first version had a yellow diagonal band, which was later changed to a horizontal stripe.

Through Boca Juniors history, the club has worn some alternate &quot;rare&quot; models, such as the AC Milan shirt in a match versus Universidad de Chile (whose uniform was also blue) in the 1963 Copa Libertadores. When Nike became official kit provider in 1996, the first model by the company introduced two thin white stripes surrounding the gold band, causing some controversy. The brand also introduced a silver jersey designed exclusively for the 1998 Copa Mercosur. For the 100th anniversary of the club, Nike launched commemorative editions of several models worn by the club since its foundation, including a version of the 1907 shirt with the diagonal sash, which was worn in two matches during the 2005 Torneo de Verano (Summer Championship). Other models were a black and white striped jersey (similar to Juventus FC) and a purple model, worn in the 2012 and 2013 &quot;Torneos de Verano,&quot; respectively.

Nevertheless, no shirt caused more controversy than the pink model released as the away jersey for the 2013–14 season, which was widely rejected by the fans. Because of that, the introduction of this model (to be initially worn v. Rosario Central) was delayed until the last fixture when Boca played Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP). As a replacement for the pink model, Nike designed a fluorescent yellow shirt launched that same season.

In 2016, the club wore a black jersey for the first time in its history, originally launched as the third kit. Although the President of the club, Daniel Angelici, had stated that the black kit would never be worn, the kit debuted in a match v. Tigre, only four days after the announcement.

Adidas is the club&#x27;s current kit supplier since January 2020. The agreement (which will remain in force until 2029) was signed for US $10,069,000 plus 40% in royalties per year for the club.

===Badge===
The club has had five different designs for its badge during its history, although its outline has remained unchanged through most of its history.

The first known emblem dates from 1911, appearing on the club&#x27;s letterhead papers. In October 1932, the club stated that one star would be added to the badge for each Primera División title won. Nevertheless, the stars would not appear until 1943, on a &quot;Report and Balance Sheet&quot;.

A version with laurel leaves appeared in a magazine in 1955 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the club, although the club never used it officially.

The emblem with the stars was announced in 1932, but it has regularly appeared on Boca Juniors uniforms since 1993.

In 1996, the Ronald Shakespear Studio introduced a new badge (with the horizontal band suppressed) as part of a visual identity for the club. The new Boca Juniors image also featured new typography and style.

;Notes
== Stadium ==

Boca Juniors used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club&#x27;s first ground was in &quot;Dársena Sur&quot; of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) but it was vacated in 1907 as it failed to meet the minimum league requirements. Boca Juniors then used three grounds in the &quot;Isla Demarchi&quot; area between 1908 and 1912. In the first year in the Primera Division (1913) the club hadn&#x27;t an own stadium and played the home games in the pitches of the other teams, likely in Estudiantes de Buenos Aires in Palermo (on Figueroa Alcorta y Dorrego), but also in Avellaneda (first official derby against the River). Between 1914 and 1915, the club moved away from La Boca for the second time in its history (beyond the 1913), moving to Wilde in the Avellaneda Partido of the Greater Buenos Aires but a relatively poor season and poor attendances in 1915 forced the club to move back to La Boca.

On 25 May 1916, Boca Juniors opened its new stadium at the intersection of Ministro Brin and Senguel streets, playing there until 1924 when the club moved to Brandsen and Del Crucero (Del Valle Iberlucea nowadays) streets, to build a new stadium there, which lasted until 1938 when the club decided to build a totally new venue, made of concrete grandstand instead of wood.

Building of Boca Juniors&#x27; current stadium began in 1938, under the supervision of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in Ferro Carril Oeste&#x27;s Estadio Ricardo Etcheverry in Caballito until it was completed on 25 May 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname &quot;La Bombonera&quot; (&#x27;The Chocolate Box&#x27;). The stand opposite the &quot;Casa Amarilla&quot; railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked one on top of the other, the only way that makes it stand into the club premises.

La Bombonera is known for vibrating when Boca fans (La 12) jump in rhythm; in particular, the unique vertical side will sway slightly, leading to the phrase, &quot;La Bombonera no tiembla. Late&quot; (&quot;The Bombonera does not tremble. It beats&quot;)

La Bombonera currently has a capacity of around 54,000. The club&#x27;s popularity make tickets hard to come by, especially for the &quot;Superclásico&quot; game against River Plate. There are further improvements planned for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, use of new technology and improved corporate facilities.

Apart from the venues listed, Boca Juniors also played its home games at Estudiantes de Buenos Aires&#x27;s stadium (in 1913, then located on Figueroa Alcorta Avenue) and Ferro Carril Oeste stadium (1938–40, while &quot;La Bombonera&quot; was under construction).

In 2023 while running for the president&#x27;s role of the club, Jorge Reale famously unveiled plans and designs of a new state-of-the-art roofed stadium that would house 112,000 spectators, 444 VIP boxes and 4,000 parking spaces. The plan was ceased in the following year after the incumbent president, Juan Roman Riquelme, a popular figure among fans due to his footballing heroics as a player, won the presidential election.

==Supporters==

=== Fanbase ===

Boca Juniors is traditionally regarded as the club of Argentina&#x27;s working class, in contrast with the supposedly more upper-class base of cross-town arch rival River Plate who moved to the more affluent district of Núñez in the north of the city in 1923.

Boca Juniors claims to be the club of &quot;half plus one&quot; (&quot;la mitad más uno&quot;) of Argentina&#x27;s population. A 2006 survey placed its following at 40%, still the largest share. Nevertheless, they have the highest number of fans, as judged by percentage in their country.

In 1975, a film (&quot;La Raulito&quot;) was made about the life of Mary Esher Duffau, known as La Raulito, a well-known Boca Juniors fan. She died at the age of 74 on 30 April 2008, the same day Boca Juniors played a Copa Libertadores match against Brazilian club, Cruzeiro Esporte Clube with the players and fans observing a minute&#x27;s silence in her memory.

=== Club membership ===
Boca Juniors usually play their league games in front of capacity crowds. The club&#x27;s popularity make tickets hard to come by, especially for the &quot;Superclásico&quot; game against River Plate.

As of early 2023 Boca has a 314,000 member base, which ranks second only to Bayern Munich worldwide, and it is first in Argentina and also first in South America.

===Nicknames===

Boca fans are known as &quot;Los Xeneizes&quot; (the Genoese) after the Genoese immigrants who founded the team and lived in La Boca in the early 20th century.

Many rival fans in Argentina refer to the Boca Juniors&#x27; fans as &quot;Los Bosteros&quot; (the manure handlers), originating from the horse manure used in the brick factory which occupied the ground where &quot;La Bombonera&quot; stands. Originally an insult used by rivals, Boca fans are now proud of it.

Reflecting the team&#x27;s colors, Boca&#x27;s shirt is also called &quot;la azul y oro&quot; (the blue and gold).

==== La Doce ====
There is also a society which dedicates all of its activities to supporting the team known as &quot;la número 12&quot; or &quot;la doce&quot; (player number &quot;doce&quot; or 12, meaning &quot;the 12th player&quot;).

The origin of the group dates back to 1925, when the Boca Juniors fanatic &quot;Toto&quot; Caffarena accompanied the team during a tournament in Europe in 1925. From then on, he was considered the &quot;twelfth player&quot;, hence the name &quot;La doce&quot;.

The naming of &quot;La 12&quot; (the twelfth player), by which Boca Juniors&#x27; fans became known, dates back to the year 1925, during the European tour they made that year.

At that time, the team was accompanied by a Boca fan called Victoriano Caffarena, who belonged to a wealthy family and funded part of the tour.

During that tour he helped the team in everything, thus establishing a strong relationship with the players, so they named him &quot;Player No. 12&quot;.

When they returned to Argentina, Caffarena was as well known as the players themselves. Nowadays, this nickname is used primarily to name their group of supporters, known as &quot;La 12&quot;.

==== Ultras &amp; illegal activities ====
Some Boca fans run ultra organizations similar to other &quot;barra brava&quot; gangs associated with football clubs in Argentina but in the name of &quot;La doce&quot;.

Their illegal activities include assault, drug sales and trafficking, extortion, and murder.

They finance its activities by selling parking, reselling club tickets, and extorting commissions from the sale of players, plus the club for transportation to domestic and international events as well as their means of financing their activities.

If their demands are not met, they threaten violence at home matches or to take down club officials.

===International===
&quot;Peñas&quot; (fan clubs) exist in a number of Argentine cities and abroad in countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Spain, Israel and Japan.

Boca Juniors are particularly popular in Japan, because of the club&#x27;s success in the early 2000s at the Intercontinental Cup held in Japan.

Elsewhere internationally, fans are drawn to Boca by the club&#x27;s international titles and by the success of Boca players who went on to play in European football such as Hugo Ibarra, Rodolfo Arruabarrena, Diego Cagna, Enzo Ferrero, Roberto Abbondanzieri, Nicolás Burdisso, Fernando Gago, Diego Maradona, Claudio Caniggia, Gabriel Batistuta, Juan Román Riquelme and Carlos Tevez.

Boca has fans throughout Latin America and also in parts of the United States where there has been Latin immigration. In July 2007, after the club had toured pre-season, it was reported that the club was considering the possibility of creating a &quot;Boca Juniors USA&quot; team to compete in Major League Soccer.

== Rivalries ==

Boca Juniors has had a long-standing, heated rivalry with River Plate known as the Superclásico, known worldwide as one of world football&#x27;s fiercest and most important rivalries in Argentina and the world.

The Superclásico is mostly noted for the fan passion, simultaneous jumping of the fans and fan songs (often based on popular Argentine rock band tunes) against their rivals, games have been ocassionaly been marred by riots between the hardest supporters of both sides or against the police.

Out of their 338 previous meetings, Boca have won 126, River have won 107 and there have been 105 draws. Boca Juniors and River Plate have played 259 official games all time against each other, with Boca winning 91, River winning 85 and 83 draws.

The intensity of the rivalry has not stopped players from playing for both clubs, most notably José Manuel Moreno, Hugo Orlando Gatti, Alberto Tarantini, Oscar Ruggeri, Julio Olarticoechea, Carlos Tapia, Gabriel Batistuta and Claudio Caniggia.

The English newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; put the Superclásico (played at La Bombonera) at the top of their list of &quot;50 sporting things you must do before you die&quot;.

<text>Faisalabad (; Punjabi, , ; ), formerly known as Lyallpur (Punjabi, ), is the 3rd largest city of Pakistan after Karachi and Lahore respectively. It is second largest city and industrial heart of Punjab, Pakistan.

Historically one of the largest villages of Punjab, Lyallpur was one of the first planned cities within British India. It was restructured into city district status; a devolution promulgated by the 2001 local government ordinance (LGO). The total area of Faisalabad District is while the area controlled by the Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) is .

Faisalabad has become a major industrial and distribution hub due to its centrally located infrastructure (connecting roads, rails, and air transportation). It has been referred to as the Manchester of Pakistan because of its extensive textile industry.
, the GDP of Faisalabad was estimated at $43 billion and projected to rise to $87 billion in 2025 at a growth rate of 5.7%.
Faisalabad contributes over 10 percent to the Punjab&#x27;s GDP and has an average annual GDP (nominal) of $20.5 billion. Agriculture and industry remain its hallmarks.

== Etymology ==

Faisalabad was formerly (until 1977) known as Lyallpur. When founded in 1890 it was named after Sir James Broadwood Lyall, the British lieutenant governor of the Punjab. It became headquarters of the Lower Chenab colony and in 1898 was incorporated as a municipality.

In September 1977, the city of Lyallpur was renamed &quot;Faisalabad&quot; by the Government of Pakistan for Saudi Arabian king Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his kingdom&#x27;s long relationship with Pakistan and its people.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
The city was settled or established in 1880 during the colonisation of the lower Chenab Valley. This city was settled down by Rai Bahadur Bhavanidas Sikka, after which the British Government granted jagirs to him. After Partition his descendants settled in India, now settled in Mumbai. This city was named in honour of Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, Sir James Broadwood Lyall, for his role in establishing the canal colonisation project. The surname &quot;Lyall&quot; was joined with the noun &quot;pur&quot;, meaning &#x27;city&#x27; in Sanskrit.

On 1 September 1977, the Government of Pakistan changed the name of the city from Lyallpur to Faisalabad &quot;(&#x27;City of Faisal&#x27;)&quot; in honour of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who made several financial contributions to Pakistan.

===Early settlements===
The region encompassing modern day Faisalabad district was originally inhabited by a number of forest-dwelling tribes. It is believed these early settlements belonged to the ancient districts of Jhang and Sandalbar, and included the area between Shahdara to Shorekot and Sangla Hill to Toba Tek Singh. The shrine of Baba Noor Shah Wali was erected in the area in the 1600s.

===Development===
At the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the entire Punjab region became administered as Punjab province, firstly by the East India Company and after 1858 as part of the British Raj.

In the 1880s the Punjab government began an irrigation scheme to cultivate large tracts of western Punjab through the creation of canal colonies. The Chenab colony was the largest of these colonisation projects, and covered the entirety of present-day Faisalabad district. Popham Young, the Colonisation Officer managing the project identified the site of the current city to establish headquarters for the colony.

Young designed the settlement&#x27;s centre to replicate the design in the Union Jack with eight roads extending from a large clock tower at its epicentre; a design geometrically symbolic of the Cross of Saint Andrew counter changed with the Cross of Saint Patrick, and Saint George&#x27;s Cross over all. The eight roads developed into eight separate bazaars (markets) leading to different regions of the Punjab. In 1892, the newly constructed town with its growing agricultural surplus was added to the British rail network. Construction of the rail link between Wazirabad and Lyallpur was completed in 1895. In 1896, Gujranwala, Jhang and Montgomery comprising the Tehsils of Lyallpur were under the administrative control of the Jhang District. The town became one of the first planned settlements within British India.

In 1904, the new district of Lyallpur was created to include the tehsils of Samundri and Toba Tek Singh with a sub-tehsil at Jaranwala, which later became a full tehsil in itself. The University of Agriculture, originally the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute, Lyallpur, was established in 1906. The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909. Lyallpur grew into an established agricultural tool and grain centre. By 1911 the city had a population of 19,578. The 1930s brought industrial growth and market expansion to the textile industry as well as to food processing, grain crushing and chemicals.

=== Independence ===
In August 1947, following three decades of nationalist struggles, India and Pakistan achieved independence. The British agreed to partition British India into two sovereign states – Pakistan with a Muslim majority, and India with a Hindu majority. However, more Muslims remained in India than what governing authorities believed would assimilate into Pakistan. The partitioning led to a mass migration of an estimated 10 million people which made it the largest mass migration in human history. The Punjab province was divided into Punjab, West Pakistan and Punjab, India. There were also respective divisions of the British Indian Army, the Indian Civil Service, various administrative services, the central treasury, and the railways. Riots and local fighting followed the expeditious withdrawal of the British, resulting in an estimated one million civilians deaths, particularly in the western region of Punjab. Lyallpur, which was located in the region of the Punjab Province that became West Pakistan, was populated by a minority of Hindus and Sikhs who migrated to India, while Muslim refugees from East Punjab settled in the district.

In 1977, Pakistani authorities changed the name of the city from Lyallpur to Faisalabad, in order to honor the close friendship of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia with Pakistan.

During the eighties, the city saw an influx of foreign investments in the textile sector. Large number of residents of Faisalabad began working abroad as bilateral ties improved as part of new trade agreements. This led to more foreign remittances into the city. This aided the development of large scale infrastructure projects within the city. In 1985, the city was upgraded as a division with the districts of Faisalabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Faisalabad lies in the rolling flat plains of northeast Punjab, at above sea level. The city proper comprises approximately while the district encompasses more than . The Chenab River flows about , and the Ravi River meanders to the southeast. The lower Chenab canal provides water to 80% of cultivated lands making it the main source of irrigation. Faisalabad is bound on the north by Chiniot and Sheikhupura, on the east by Sheikhupura and Sahiwal, on the south by Sahiwal and Toba Tek Singh and on the west by Jhang.
=== Geology ===
The district of Faisalabad is part of the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.

The soil consists of young stratified silt loam or very fine sand loam which makes the subsoil weak in structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad is winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion. Faisalabad is situated at the centre of the lower Rechna Doab, the area is located between the Chenab and Ravi rivers. There is a mild slope from the northeast to the southwest with an average fall of . The city is situated at an elevation of about .

If the monsoon currents interact with the western disturbance, then cloudburst can also occur. July is the wettest month of the year during which flooding is reported a number of times. Monsoon ends in September and then the dry period begins. October and November are the driest months with very little rainfall. During winter the weather usually remains cloudy associated with frequent fog. Record-breaking rainfall of was recorded on 5 September 1961 by the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

According to a report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the 2015 literacy rate for Pakistan ranked 160th which is among the lowest literacy rates in the world.

In 1981, Faisalabad was among four districts in Punjab, which included Gujranwala, Jhelum and Gujrat, that were experiencing low literacy rates, due primarily to either a lack of resources or family pressure; the latter of which may also be attributable to illiteracy. In 1998, Faisalabad progressed to a higher literacy rate with the most improvement realised at the primary school level. In 2008, Faisalabad District ranked 51.9% which placed the district ninth in literacy out of the 34 Punjab districts.

In 2014, the city held its first literary festival which brought a number of writers to the city to encourage the community to follow the arts. Two literary groups were established, the Faisalabad Union of Column Writers and Faisalabad Union of Journalists, to bring together printed media personalities for the purpose of providing training to budding writers from the city.

== Demographics ==

The language of Faisalabad is Punjabi predominantly 96%, Urdu and Pashto are spoken by 2% population each. Faisalabad is world&#x27;s second largest Punjabi speaking city.
Faisalabad was established as one of the first planned towns of British India, covering an area of . It was initially designed to accommodate 20,000 people. The city&#x27;s population increased from 69,930 in 1941 to 179,000 in 1951 (152.2% increase). Much of the increase is attributed to the settlement of Muslim refugees from East Punjab and Haryana, India. In 1961, the population rose to 425,248, an increase of 137.4%. Faisalabad set a record in the demographic history of Pakistan by registering an overall population increase of 508.1% between 1941 and 1961. The industrial revolution of the 1960s contributed to population growth. In 1961, the population was 425,248. A 1972 census ranked Faisalabad as the third largest city of Pakistan with a population of 864,000. In a 1981 census, the population was 1,092,000; however, the Faisalabad Development Authority estimated the number to be 1,232,000. In the 2017 consensus, the total population of the city was 3,203,846

=== Religion and ethnic groups ===
The province of Punjab, in which Faisalabad is the second largest city, has prevalent sociocultural distinctions. Population sizes vary by district but some distinguishing factors include a young age structure, high age dependency ratio, a higher percentage of males, a higher proportion of married population, and heterogeneity in tribes and languages.

Islam is the most common religion, with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet. People live in tight-knit joint families, although a nuclear family system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions. Ancient culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and tribes. However, the influences of more modern societies have effected some change, particularly in the area of the dowry system. In the following ancient culture, marriages are customarily arranged by the parents or matchmakers. In some instances, the husband must buy his wife from her parents. Studies conducted in 2007 and 2013, the latter in an outlying rural village in Faisalabad District, acknowledged the existence of gender bias and discrimination against females, stating that &quot;Gender discrimination is not a new phenomenon&quot;, and that it still exists in the modern world.

Social change in the region has been a slow process but there are indications that change has occurred as more villages are exposed to various forms of media and modernized urban communities. In early 2014, there was a march known as the &quot;White Ribbon Campaign&quot; which took place in front of the Faisalabad Press Club. Protesters appealed to the government to adopt new laws &quot;to protect women who are discriminated against in the family and workplace.&quot;

Prevalent minorities, particularly Hindu and Christian, feel a sense of vulnerability because of their religious beliefs. Labourers and farmhands form the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste by virtue of their birth. A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blasphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance, such as Canada and Australia.

<text>A defensive fighting position is a type of earthwork constructed in a military context, generally large enough to accommodate anything from one soldier to a fire team (or similar sized unit).

== Terminology ==

Tobruk type positions are named after the system of defensive positions constructed, initially, by the Italian Army at Tobruk, Libya. After Tobruk fell to the Allies in January 1941, the existing positions were modified and significantly expanded by the Australian Army which, along with other Allied forces, reused them in the Siege of Tobruk.

A foxhole is one type of defensive strategic position. It is a &quot;small pit used for cover, usually for one or two personnel, and so constructed that the occupants can effectively fire from it&quot;.

It is known more commonly within United States Army slang as a &quot;fighting position&quot; or as a &quot;ranger grave&quot;. It is known as a &quot;fighting hole&quot; in the United States Marine Corps, a &quot;gun-pit&quot; in Australian Army terminology, and a &quot;fighting pit&quot; in the New Zealand Army.

In British and Canadian military argot it equates to a range of terms including slit trench, or fire trench (a trench deep enough for a soldier to stand in), a sangar (sandbagged fire position above ground) or shell scrape (a shallow depression that affords protection in the prone position), or simply—but less accurately—as a &quot;trench&quot;.

During the American Civil War the term &quot;rifle pit&quot; was recognized by both U.S. Army and Confederate Army forces.

A protected emplacement or concealed post in which one or several machine guns are set up is known in U.S. English as a machine gun nest.

==History==

During the fighting in North Africa (1942–43), U.S. forces employed the shell scrape. This was a very shallow excavation allowing one soldier to lie horizontally while shielding his body from nearby shell bursts and small arms fire. The shell scrape soon proved inadequate in this role, as the few inches of dirt above the soldier&#x27;s body could often be penetrated by bullets or shell fragments. It also exposed the user to assault by enemy tanks, which could crush a soldier inside a shallow shell scrape by driving into it, then making a simple half-turn.

After the Battle of Kasserine Pass (early 1943), U.S. troops increasingly adopted the modern &quot;&quot;, a vertical, bottle-shaped hole that allowed a soldier to stand and fight with head and shoulders exposed. The foxhole widened near the bottom to allow a soldier to crouch down while under intense artillery fire or tank attack. Foxholes could be enlarged to two-soldier fighting positions, as well as excavated with firing steps for crew-served weapons or sumps for water drainage or live enemy grenade disposal.

===Tobruks===
The Germans used hardened fortifications in North Africa and later in other fortifications, such as the Atlantic Wall, that were in essence foxholes made from concrete. The Germans knew them officially as &quot;Ringstände&quot;; the Allies called them &quot;Tobruks&quot; because they had first encountered the structures during the fighting in Africa.

Frequently, the Germans put a turret from an obsolete French or German tank on the foxhole. This gave the Tobruk enhanced firepower and the gunner protection from shrapnel and small arms.
==Modern designs==

Modern militaries publish and distribute elaborate field manuals for the proper construction of DFPs in stages. Initially, a shallow &quot;shell scrape&quot; is dug, often called a ranger grave, which provides very limited protection. Each stage develops the fighting position, gradually increasing its effectiveness, while always maintaining functionality. In this way, a soldier can improve the position over time, while being able to stop at any time and use the position in a fight.

Typically, a DFP is a pit or trench dug deep enough to stand in, with only the head exposed, and a small step at the bottom, called a fire step, that allows the soldier to crouch on to avoid fire and tank treads. The fire step usually slopes down into a deeper narrow slit called a grenade sump at the bottom to allow for live grenades to be kicked in to minimize damage from grenade fragments.

When possible, DFPs are revetted with corrugated iron, star pickets and wire or local substitutes. Ideally, the revetting will also be dug in below ground level so as to minimise damage from fire and tank tracks. The revetting helps the DFP resist cave-in from near misses from artillery or mortars and tank tracks.

Time permitting, DFPs can be enlarged to allow a machine gun crew and ammunition to be protected, as well as additional overhead cover via timbers.

In training, DFPs are usually dug by hand or in some cases by mechanical trench diggers. On operations, explosives, especially shaped charges (&quot;beehives&quot;), may be used to increase the speed of development.

Developing and maintaining DFPs is a constant and ongoing task for soldiers deployed in combat areas. For this reason, in some armies, infantry soldiers are referred to as &quot;gravel technicians&quot;, as they spend so much time digging.

Because of the large expenditure in effort and materials required to build a DFP, it is important to ensure that the DFP is correctly sited. In order to site the DFP, the officer in charge (&quot;OIC&quot;) should view the ground from the same level that the intended user&#x27;s weapons will be sighted from. Normally, the OIC will need to lie on his belly to obtain the required perspective. This ensures that the position will be able to cover the desired sector.

<doc id="401885" wikidata="Q94529" url="?curid=401885" title="Asteroseismology">
<text>Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations in stars. Stars have many resonant modes and frequencies, and the path of sound waves passing through a star depends on the local speed of sound, which in turn depends on local temperature and chemical composition. Because the resulting oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature.

Asteroseismology is closely related to helioseismology, the study of stellar pulsation specifically in the Sun. Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.

== Theoretical background ==

By linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four differential equations whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star&#x27;s modes of oscillation. The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by spherical harmonics, indexed by an angular degree formula_1 and azimuthal order formula_2. In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis. The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of formula_1, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.

By additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the &quot;Cowling&quot; approximation) and that the star&#x27;s structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction formula_4,
formula_5
where
formula_6 is the radial co-ordinate in the star,
formula_7 is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode,
formula_8 is the sound speed inside the star,
formula_9 is the Brunt–Väisälä or buoyancy frequency and
formula_10 is the Lamb frequency.
The last two are defined by
formula_11
and
formula_12
respectively. By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators,
this implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either
greater or less than both formula_10 and formula_9. We identify the former case
as high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency
gravity modes (g-modes).

This basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy)
where we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star. By plotting the
curves formula_15 and formula_16 (for given
formula_1), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both
curves or frequencies above both curves.

== Excitation mechanisms ==

=== Kappa-mechanism ===

Under fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature. This opacity &quot;bump&quot; can drive oscillations through the formula_18-mechanism (or &quot;Eddington valve&quot;). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star&#x27;s envelope.

Pulsations driven by the formula_18-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes. It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables.

=== Surface convection ===

In stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency.
Because the modes are intrinsically stable, they have low amplitudes and are relatively short-lived. This is the driving mechanism in all solar-like oscillators.

=== Convective blocking ===

If the base of a surface convection zone is sharp and the convective timescales slower than the pulsation timescales, the convective flows react too slowly to perturbations that can build up into large, coherent pulsations. This mechanism is known as &quot;convective blocking&quot;
and is believed to drive pulsations in the formula_20 Doradus variables.

=== Tidal excitation ===

Observations from the &quot;Kepler&quot; satellite revealed eccentric binary systems in which oscillations are excited during the closest approach. These systems are known as &quot;heartbeat&quot; stars because of the characteristic shape of the lightcurves.

== Types of oscillators ==

=== Solar-like oscillators ===

Because solar oscillations are driven by near-surface convection, any stellar oscillations caused similarly are known as &quot;solar-like oscillations&quot; and the stars themselves as &quot;solar-like oscillators&quot;. However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not &quot;Sun-like&quot;.

=== Cepheid variables ===

Cepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star. They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses. They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months. Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness.

Cepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium.

=== RR Lyrae variables ===

RR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. Population II) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar). They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone. The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium. Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the Blazhko effect.

=== Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars ===

Delta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence. They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium.

SX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables.

Gamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type. The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes. Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking.

Following results from &quot;Kepler&quot;, it appears that many Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids.

=== Rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars ===

Rapidly oscillating Ap stars have similar parameters to Delta Scuti variables, mostly being A- and F-type, but they are also strongly magnetic and chemically peculiar (hence the &quot;p&quot; spectral subtype). Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the &quot;oblique pulsator model&quot;: the mode&#x27;s frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star&#x27;s rotation (as is the case in the Earth). The oscillation modes have frequencies around 1500 μHz and amplitudes of a few mmag.

=== Slowly pulsating B stars and Beta Cephei variables ===

Slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are B-type stars with oscillation periods of a few days, understood to be high-order gravity modes excited by the kappa mechanism. Beta Cephei variables are slightly hotter (and thus more massive), also have modes excited by the kappa mechanism and additionally oscillate in low-order gravity modes with periods of several hours. Both classes of oscillators contain only slowly rotating stars.

=== Variable subdwarf B stars ===

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are in essence the cores of core-helium burning giants who have somehow lost most of their hydrogen envelopes, to the extent that there is no hydrogen-burning shell. They have multiple oscillation periods that range between about 1 and 10 minutes and amplitudes anywhere between 0.001 and 0.3 mag in visible light. The oscillations are low-order pressure modes, excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the iron opacity bump.

=== White dwarfs ===

White dwarfs are characterized by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except that the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way. Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB. Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is too young for them to have cooled enough. White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate. The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables). All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes. The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute. GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.

==Space missions==

A number of past, present and future spacecraft have asteroseismology studies as a significant part of their missions (order chronological).

*WIRE – A NASA satellite launched in 1999. A failed large infrared telescope, the two-inch aperture star tracker was used for more than a decade as a bright-star asteroseismology instrument. Re-entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere 2011.
*MOST – A Canadian satellite launched in 2003. The first spacecraft dedicated to asteroseismology.
*CoRoT – A French led ESA planet-finder and asteroseismology satellite launched in 2006.
*Kepler space telescope – A NASA planet-finder spacecraft launched in 2009, repurposed as &quot;K2&quot; since the failure of a second reaction wheel prevented the telescope from continuing to monitor the same field.
*BRITE – A constellation of nanosatellites used to study the brightest oscillating stars. First two satellites launched Feb 25, 2013.
*TESS – A NASA planet-finder that will survey bright stars across most of the sky launched in 2018.
*PLATO – A planned ESA mission that will specifically exploit asteroseismology to obtain accurate masses and radii of transiting planets.

<text>Amman New Camp, usually known as the Al-Wehdat or Al-Wihdat camp (), which is located in the Hay Al Awdah neighbourhood in southeast Amman, the capital city of Jordan, occupies a , Of the ten recognized Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Al-Wehdat is the second largest, with a population of roughly 57,000 registered refugees, which includes 8,400 students. The United Nation body responsible for administrating Palestinian refugee camps, is the Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

==Administration==
In 2010, Al-Wihdat was a part of Al-&#x27;Awd (&quot;The Return&quot;) quarter of the Al-Yarmouk district of Amman.

==History==

Al-Widhat was one of four refugee camps set up by UNWRA to accommodate Palestine refugees who left Mandatory Palestine following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, along with Irbid camp, Jabal el-Hussein camp and Zarqa Camp. It was established in 1955 with the arrival of 5,000 refugees from villages between Jaffa and Jerusalem. At first refugees lived in tents. In 1957, UNWRA built 1,260 shelters to add to the 1,400 shelters they initially built on an area of , south of the outskirts of Amman at the time.

For almost fifteen years, until the 1970s most families were living in shelters and tents.

After the Black September conflicts which lasted from 1970 to 1971, UNRWA worked with the Jordanian government to improve living conditions in Al-Widhat.

In 1987-88, 17 percent of households in Wihdat lived in one-room dwellings, compared to 6 percent by 2011. By 2011, 44 percent of households in Wihdat lived in two room-dwellings. In terms of crowding, Fafo Foundation (FAFO) uses the square metre per capita, with Wihdat as one of the &quot;lowest median per capita square metres of living space.&quot;

During the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Al-Wihdat in Jordan became a center of activity for Palestinian nationalists. Even the Al-Wihdat soccer club&#x27;s matches were synonymous with the &#x27;Palestinian&#x27; identity in public life.&quot;

The eastern quarters of Al-Wihdat developed a low-middle class housing areas with three- and four-storied buildings. There were slum-like areas in the southern quarters of the camp.

The camp, which is not enclosed by walls or fences, was an open space with a thriving economic area. Although there are several main roads in the camp, it is crisscrossed with &quot;narrow passageways and twisting alleys.&quot; The eastern quarters of Al-Wihdat developed a low-middle class housing areas with three- and four-storied buildings. There were slum-like areas in the southern quarters of the camp, where heavy stones anchored zinc roofs.

By the late 2000s, there were over 2,000 registered &quot;shops and enterprises&quot; offering a wide variety of goods and services operating in Al-Wehdat. The large souk in Al Wehdat attracted customers from outside the camp with its wide variety of goods, such as vegetables from the Jordan Valley, and clothing from China, offered at lower prices than other markets in Amman.

==Demographics==
By 2010, there were 48,000 inhabitants which included about &quot;8,000 local gypsies, Egyptian labor migrants, Iraqi refugees and other low-income non-Jordanian groups.&quot; By 2017, there were about 57,000 registered refugees, which includes 8,400 students in Al-Wihdat and almost 370,000 Palestine refugees in Jordan, which represents 18 per cent of Jordan&#x27;s total. Jordan accommodates the most Palestine refugees of all of the UNWRA locations. In Jordan, most, but not all, Palestine refugees have full citizenship. By 2017, of the 5 million registered Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, 2 million were in Jordan.

==UNRWA== 
UNRWA, which was established in 1949, provides funding for Palestine refugees to have access to education, &quot;primary health care for more than 3.5 million patients and assistance to over 250,000 acutely vulnerable Palestine refugees.&quot; UNRWA services in Al-Wehdat includes 13 schools, a health center, a rehabilitation center, a women&#x27;s programme center, an environmental health office and a camp services office. UNWRA also ran a Teacher Training College in Amman.

Seventy percent of UNRWA money funds go to the 700 UNRWA schools attended by 500,000 children and adolescents. In October 2017, the European Union voted to contribute an additional  million to UNRWA in response to a call &quot;to help close a shortfall&quot;.

==Major challenges==
UNRWA, cited a 2013 Fafo Foundation report, said that Amman New camp is ranked second out of the ten Palestine refugee camps in Jordan in terms of poverty and female employment. The income of 34% of Palestine refugees there is below Jordan&#x27;s national poverty line of JD 814. Only 24% of the women in the camp are employed. Eight percent of the camp&#x27;s population have severe chronic health problems, making it the worst of all the ten. Sixty-six percent of the refugees there have no health insurance. There are no green areas or open play space in the camp which is overcrowded. Many shelters were built in the 1950s and are now in bad state of repair. Many needed to be torn down and replaced as &quot;the building material is inadequate (roofs made of corrugated metal plates, cement of poor quality).&quot;

UNRWA receives 30 percent of its budget from the United States. The US announced on January 16, 2018, that they will withhold $60 million of the $125 million it had planned to send to UNRWA in 2018. UNRWA funding is almost entirely from U.N. member states. According to &quot;Spiegel&quot; journalist Thore Schröder, who visited Al-Wehdat in January 2018, teachers, doctors and garbage collectors have been laid off and people who live in Al-Wehdat have rented pick-up trucks to manage garbage disposal. Schools are closed for the holidays. According to the 2018 &quot;Spiegel&quot; article, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants the UNRWA to be completely replaced by UNHCR. Schröder cites the case of a 52-year-old tailor who was born in Amman, Jordan, has lived there all his life, but maintains that his real home is the village Ramla, in the heart of Israel that he has never visited. Netanyahu says the hope of the Palestinian right of return, is unrealistic.

==Al-Wehdat SC==

The Al-Wehdat Sports Club was originally established at the camp in 1956 by the UNWRA as the Al-Wehdat Youth Center. By 1975 Al-Wihdat won the Jordanian league.

==Notable people==
Notable people from Al-Wehdat include writer Ibrahim Nasrallah whose parents came to Al Wehdat in 1948, when they were forced from their home in Al-Burayj in Palestine. His series of novels, &quot;Gaza Weddings&quot;, were translated into English in 2017. Nasrallah&#x27;s parents took refuge in Al-Wehdat camp after they were uprooted from their home in Al-Bruij near Jerusalem in 1948. Nasrallah, who was born and grew up in the camp, studied at UNWRA schools there and the UNRWA Teacher Training College in Amman.

Nihad Awad, who is the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), has been interviewed frequently by Fox, the BBC, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Al-Jazeera, C-Span, and other mainstream media outlets.

<text>Peng Zhen (pronounced ; October 12, 1902 – April 26, 1997) was a Chinese politician and leading member of the Chinese Communist Party. He led the party organization in Beijing following the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, but was purged during the Cultural Revolution for opposing Mao&#x27;s views on the role of literature in relation to the state. He was rehabilitated under Deng Xiaoping in 1982 along with other &#x27;wrongly accused&#x27; officials, and became the inaugural head of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.

==Biography==
Born in Houma, Shanxi province, Peng was originally named Fu Maogong (傅懋恭). He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1923 as a founding member of the Shanxi Province CCP. Arrested in 1929, he continued underground political activities while imprisoned. He was released from prison in 1935 and began organizing a resistance movement against the invading Japanese forces. Peng was important in developing the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Around the same time, he was appointed the Organization Department Director of the North Bureau of CCP. 

Peng also served on a number of positions as vice-president of the Central Party School and director of the CCP Policy Research Office. In 1945 he served in the history research committee and the organizing committee of the CCP&#x27;s 7th National Congress.

In September 1945 Peng was sent by Mao Zedong to take up overall leadership of the CCP in Northeast China. He was accompanied by Lin Biao who was to assist Peng with directing military operations against the Nationalists. Peng decided that the CCP could hold the 3 big cities of the Northeast: Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin. When the Nationalists under the command of Du Yuming attacked in November 1945, the Communists were forced back. Peng was removed as the CCP leader in the northeast after further failure by Lin Biao&#x27;s forces in March 1946 led to the Communists retreat back to Harbin.

Peng was a member of the CCP Central Committee starting from 1944 as well as a member of the Secretariat of the CCP Central Committee. He also held the positions of First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and Mayor of Beijing from 1951 to 1966. In addition to being mayor, he was a high-ranking member of the Politburo from 1956 to 1966. In June 1960, he attended Bucharest Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers Parties, countering Soviet leader Khrushchev during the conference.

Peng was appointed head of the Five Man Group in charge of preparing a &quot;cultural revolution&quot;, but he fell out of favor with Mao Zedong in April 1966 when he attacked Mao&#x27;s belief that all literature should support the state. He was accused of being an associate to Wu Han&#x27;s counter-revolutionary clique and deposed at a May 1966 conference in what became the opening act of the Cultural Revolution. Lu Dingyi, Luo Ruiqing and Yang Shangkun were also deposed.

Peng survived the Cultural Revolution, and was eventually rehabilitated under Deng Xiaoping. He subsequently became Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, a post he already held from late 1950s in the capacity of leader of a Central Politics and Law Leading Group. Beginning in 1983, as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People&#x27;s Congress, he sought to increase the NPC&#x27;s power. He used the NPC as a base to oppose reform. In January 1987, Peng Zhen played a pivotal role in Hu Yaobang&#x27;s resignation as General Secretary by attack and criticizing Hu during a meeting. Peng left Politburo after the 13th Party Congress in November 1987 and retired from politics in March 1988 after Wan Li took over his position as Chairman of Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress. 

During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Peng Zhen supported the declaration of martial law in Beijing and the removal of Zhao Ziyang.

Peng Zhen died on April 26, 1997, from blood cancer aged 94, two months after the death of former vice premier Deng Xiaoping, and was eulogized with high honours by the highest organs of the party and the state. His official obituary declared him a &quot;great proletarian revolutionary, politician, and outstanding expert in the affairs of the state; unswerving Marxist, instrumental in laying the foundations of legal institution in our country, and excellent leader of the party and state.&quot; The obituary also curiously made mention of his support of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s 1992 &quot;southern tour&quot; which re-ignited economic reforms after relative stagnation following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.

He was considered one of the Eight Elders of the CCP.

<text>Energy Star (trademarked ENERGY STAR) is an energy-efficiency program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The EPA establishes energy efficiency specifications, and those that meet these specifications are eligible to display the ENERGY STAR logo. 

More than 75 product categories are eligible for the ENERGY STAR label, including appliances, electronics, lighting, heating and cooling systems, and commercial equipment such as food service products. In the United States, the ENERGY STAR label often appears with the EnergyGuide label of eligible appliances to highlight energy-efficient products and compare energy use and operating costs.

One of the most successful voluntary initiatives introduced by the U.S. government, the program has saved 5 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than US$500 billion in energy costs, and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

Elements of the ENERGY STAR program are implemented in Canada, Japan, and Switzerland. In 2018, a 15-year long agreement with the European Union expired. A previous agreement with the European Free Trade Association also ended.

==History==
The Energy Star program was established by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992 and operates under the authority of the Clean Air Act, section 103(g), and the 2005 Energy Policy Act, section 131 (which amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, section 324). Since 1992, Energy Star and its partners are estimated to have reduced various energy bills by at least $430 billion.

The EPA manages Energy Star products, as well as home and commercial/industrial programs. The EPA develops and manages Energy Star Portfolio Manager, an online energy tracking and benchmarking tool for commercial buildings. The DOE manages Home Performance with Energy Star and provides technical support, including test procedure development for products and some verification testing of products.

Initiated as a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote energy-efficient products, Energy Star began with labels for computers and their peripherals. In 1995 the program was significantly expanded, introducing labels for residential heating and cooling systems and new homes. In 2000, the Consortium for Energy Efficiency was directed by members to begin an annual survey of Energy Star impact.

According to the U.S. Energy and Employment Report for 2016, 290,000 American workers are involved in the manufacture of Energy Star certified products and building materials. The report also projects that employment in energy efficiency will grow much faster than other areas of the energy sector—9 percent in 2017 vs. average projected growth of 5 percent across all of the energy sector—and that Energy Star will be an integral part of that market.

==Specifications==
Energy Star specifications differ with each item, and are set by the EPA.

===Computers===
Energy Star 4.0 specifications for computers became effective on July 20, 2007. The requirements are more stringent than the previous specification and existing equipment designs can no longer use the service mark unless re-qualified. They require the use of 80 Plus Bronze level or higher power supplies. Energy Star 5.0 became effective on July 1, 2009. Energy Star 6.1 became effective on September 10, 2014. Energy Star 7.1 became effective on November 16, 2018. The Version 8.0 specification for computers was finalized on October 15, 2019 and became effective on October 15, 2020.

===Servers===

The EPA released Version 1.0 of the Computer Server specifications on May 15, 2009. It covered standalone servers with one to four processor sockets. A second tier to the specification adding active state power and performance reporting for all qualified servers, as well as blade and multi-node server idle state requirements became effective December 16, 2013. The Version 2.0 Energy Star specification for Computer Servers came into effect on December 16, 2013. The Version 3.0 Energy Star specification for Enterprise Servers came into effect on June 17, 2019 .

===Appliances===

As of early 2008, average refrigerators need 20% savings over the minimum standard. Dishwashers need at least 41% savings. Most appliances as well as heating and cooling systems have a yellow EnergyGuide label showing the annual cost of operation compared to other models. This label is created through the Federal Trade Commission and often shows if an appliance is Energy Star rated. While an Energy Star label indicates that the appliance is more energy efficient than the minimum guidelines, purchasing an Energy Star labeled product does not always mean one is getting the most energy efficient option available. For example, dehumidifiers that are rated under per day of water extraction receive an Energy Star rating if they have an energy factor of 1.2 (higher is better), while those rated to per day receive an Energy Star rating for an energy factor of 1.4 or higher. Thus a higher-capacity but non-Energy Star rated dehumidifier &quot;may&quot; be a more energy efficient alternative than an Energy Star rated but lower-capacity model. The Energy Star program&#x27;s savings calculator has also been criticized for unrealistic assumptions in its model that tend to magnify savings benefits to the average consumer.

Another factor yet to be considered by the EPA and DOE is the overall effect of energy-saving requirements on the durability and expected service life of a mass-market appliance built to a consumer-level cost standard. For example, a refrigerator may be made more efficient by the use of more insulative spacing and a smaller-capacity compressor using electronics to control operation and temperature. However, this may come at the cost of reduced interior storage (or increased exterior mass) or a reduced service life due to compressor or electronic failures. In particular, electronic controls used on new-generation appliances are subject to damage from shock, vibration, moisture, or power spikes on the electrical circuit to which they are attached. Critics have pointed out that even if a new appliance is energy efficient, any consumer appliance that does not provide customer satisfaction, or must be replaced twice as often as its predecessor contributes to landfill pollution and waste of natural resources used to construct its replacement.

===Heating and cooling systems===
Energy Star qualified heat pumps, boilers, air conditioning systems, and furnaces are available. In addition, cooling and heating bills can be significantly lowered with air sealing and duct sealing. Air sealing reduces the outdoor air that penetrates a building, and duct sealing prevents attic or basement air from entering ducts and lessening the heating/cooling system’s efficiency. Energy Star qualified room air conditioners are at least 10% more energy efficient than the minimum U.S. federal government standards.

===Home electronics===
Energy Star qualified televisions use 30% less energy than average. In November 2008, television specifications were improved to limit on-mode power use, in addition to standby power which is limited by the current specifications. Standby power consumption for televisions must be 3 watts or less. A wider range of Energy Star qualified televisions will be available.

Other qualified home electronics include cordless phones, battery chargers, VCRs and external power adapters, most of which use 90% less energy.

===Imaging equipment===
The Energy Star Program Requirements for Imaging Products are focused on product families such as electrophotographic (EP) printers, inkjet printers (e.g., thermal), copiers, facsimile machines and other imaging equipment including MFD&#x27;s (multifunctional devices). Typical Electrical Consumption (TEC) of a product family are measured and reported against an allowance set by the maximum throughput of the device. Operation modes (OM) are measured and reported for devices such as inkjet products against an allowance set by the functions present in the EUT (equipment under test). Devices that included &quot;adders&quot; such as Ethernet, on-board memory, wireless, etc. are mathematically &quot;added&quot; to increase the OM allowance. On February 1, 2011, the EPA/DOE added the requirement that all products registered under the Energy Star service mark, must be tested by an AB (Accredited Body) or CB (Certification Body) Laboratory.

===Lighting===

The Energy Star is awarded to only certain bulbs that meet strict efficiency, quality, and lifetime criteria. Energy Star qualified fluorescent lighting uses 75% less energy and lasts up to ten times longer than normal incandescent lights.

Energy Star Qualified light-emitting diode (LED) Lighting:
* Reduces energy costs — uses only 20–25% of the electricity that incandescent bulbs use, and last as much as 25 times as long. LEDs use 25%-30% of the amount of energy as halogen incandescent bulbs, and last 8–25 times as long.
* Reduces cooling costs — LEDs produce very little heat.

To qualify for Energy Star certification, LED lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products will display the following characteristics:
* Brightness is equal to or greater than existing lighting technologies (incandescent or fluorescent) and light is well distributed over the area lighted by the fixture.
* Light output remains constant over time, only decreasing towards the end of the rated lifetime (at least 35,000 hours or 12 years based on use of 8 hours per day).
* Excellent color quality. The shade of white light appears clear and consistent over time.
* Efficiency is as good as or better than fluorescent lighting.
* Light comes on instantly when turned on.
* No flicker when dimmed.
* No off-state power draw. The fixture does not use power when it is turned off, with the exception of external controls, whose power should not exceed 0.5 watts in the off state.

===New Homes===
New homes or apartments that earn the Energy Star label have been verified to meet energy efficiency requirements set by U.S. EPA. Energy Star certified homes are at least 10% more efficient than homes built to code and achieve a 20% improvement on average, while providing homeowners with better quality, performance, and comfort. Nearly 1.9 million Energy Star certified homes and apartments have been certified to date. These high-performing homes can be found across the U.S. and include a complete thermal enclosure system, a high-efficiency heating, ventilation and cooling system, a comprehensive water management system, and energy-efficient lighting and appliances. Together, U.S. homeowners living in certified homes saved $360 million on their energy bills in 2016 alone. In 2020, ENERGY STAR separated single-family and multifamily construction types into their own programs: Single-Family New Construction (SFNC) and Multifamily New Construction (MFNC).

A new tier of ENERGY STAR certification, called the ENERGY STAR NextGen Certified Homes and Apartments, will be launched in 2023. This new certification uses a baseline of the ENERGY STAR Single-Family and Multifamily certification, with additional requirements such as heat pump water heaters and EV-ready charging capabilities.

==Energy performance ratings==
The Energy Star program has developed energy performance rating systems for several commercial and institutional building types and manufacturing facilities. These ratings, on a scale of 1 to 100, provide a means for benchmarking the energy efficiency of specific buildings and industrial plants against the energy performance of similar facilities. The ratings are used by building and energy managers to evaluate the energy performance of existing buildings and industrial plants. The rating systems are also used by EPA to determine if a building or plant can qualify to earn Energy Star recognition. In 2020 Energy Star released an updated guide for verifying Energy Star certifications.

Energy Star ratings have been compared to other clean energy rating systems and green building certification systems such as those by independent firms like MiQ, or LEED certifications for office buildings.

===Buildings===

The number of space types that can receive the energy performance rating in Portfolio Manager is expanding and now includes housing, bank/financial institutions, courthouses, hospitals (acute care and children&#x27;s), hotels and motels, houses of worship, K-12 schools, medical offices, offices, residence halls/dormitories, retail stores, supermarkets, warehouses (refrigerated and non-refrigerated), hotels , data centers, senior care facilities, and wastewater facilities.

See the technical descriptions for models used in the rating system at. These documents provide detailed information on the methodologies used to create the energy performance ratings including details on rating objectives, regression techniques, and the steps applied to compute a rating. Energy Star maintains a 1–100 national benchmarking rating for buildings based on building attributes depending on the category, including floor area, occupancy and energy consumption data into a free online tool provided by Energy Star.

Energy Star energy performance ratings have been incorporated into some green buildings standards, such as LEED for Existing Buildings. In the U.S., builders of energy efficient homes are able to qualify for Federal Income tax credits and deductions.

Energy Star estimated in 2020 that energy use in commercial buildings accounts for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, costing more than $100B per year.

===Industrial facilities===
Some examples of specialised industrial facilities which Energy Star has designed specific performance ratings for include:
* Automobile assembly plants 
* Cement plants
* Corn mills
* Container glass manufacturing
* Flat glass manufacturing
* Potato processing plants
* Juice processing
* Petroleum refineries
* Pharmaceutical manufacturing plants

== Small business award ==

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually recognizes small businesses that demonstrate abilities to reduce waste, conserve energy, and recycle. The businesses use resources and ideas outlined in the Energy Star program. The award was established in 1999.

==Controversies==
In March 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) performed covert testing of the Energy Star product certification process and found that Energy Star was for the most part a self-certification program that was vulnerable to fraud and abuse. While the GAO demonstrated, by submitting fake products from made-up companies, that cheating was possible, they found no evidence of consumer fraud relating to the quality or performance of Energy Star qualified products.

In response, the Environmental Protection Agency instituted third-party certification of all Energy Star products starting in 2011. Under this regime, products are tested in an EPA-recognized laboratory and reviewed by an EPA-recognized certification body before they can carry the label. In order to be recognized, labs and certification bodies must meet specified criteria and be subject to oversight by a recognized accreditation body. In addition, a percentage of Energy Star certified product models in each category are subject to off-the-shelf verification testing each year.

As of 2017, there are 23 independent certification bodies and 255 independent laboratories recognized for purposes of Energy Star product certification and testing. Most cover multiple product types. In 2016, 1,881 product models were subject to verification testing with an overall compliance rate of 95%.

In March 2017 the Trump Administration proposed a budget that would eliminate the program. This prompted an outpouring of expressions of support for the Energy Star program from environmental groups, energy efficiency advocates, and businesses.

<text>The  (; ) is a Chinese two-stringed bowed musical instrument, more specifically a spike fiddle, that is sometimes known in the Western world as the &quot;Chinese violin&quot; or a &quot;Chinese two-stringed fiddle&quot;. It is used as a solo instrument as well as in small ensembles and large orchestras. It is the most popular of the family of traditional bowed string instruments used by various ethnic groups of China. As a very versatile instrument, the is used in both traditional and contemporary music arrangements, such as pop, rock and jazz.

==History==
The can be traced back to proto-Mongolic instruments which first appeared in China during the Tang dynasty. It is believed to have evolved from the (). The is believed to have originated from the Xi people located in current northeast China.

The first Chinese character of the name of the instrument (, , &#x27;two&#x27;) is believed to come from the fact that it has two strings. An alternate explanation states that it comes from the fact that it is the second-highest in pitch to the in the modern Chinese orchestra. The second character (, ) indicates that it is a member of the family, with commonly translated to mean &#x27;barbarians&#x27;. The name literally means &#x27;instrument of the Hu peoples&#x27;, suggesting that the instrument may have originated from regions to the north or west of China generally inhabited by nomadic people on the extremities of past Chinese kingdoms.

For most of history, the was mostly a folk instrument used in southern China, whereas the was preferred among northern musicians. However, in the 1920s, Liu Tianhua introduced the to Beijing, and since, it has become the most popular of the .

===Historical and bowed string bows===
Historic bowed zithers of China, including the , , and , and also the Korean , were originally played by bowing with a rosined stick, which created friction against the strings. As soon as the horsehair bow was invented, it spread very widely.

==Construction==
The consists of a long vertical stick-like neck, at the top of which are two big tuning pegs, and at the bottom is a small resonator body (sound box) which is covered with python skin on the front (playing) end. Two strings are attached from the pegs to the base, and a small loop of string (, ) placed around the neck and strings acting as a nut pulls the strings towards the skin, holding a minute wooden bridge in place.

The has some unusual features: 

* Its characteristic sound is produced through the vibration of the python skin by bowing. 
* There is no fingerboard; the player stops the strings by pressing their fingertips onto the strings without the strings touching the neck. 
* The horse hair bow is never separated from the strings (which were formerly of twisted silk but which today are usually made of metal); it passes between them as opposed to over them (the latter being the case with western bowed stringed instruments). 
* Although there are two strings, they are very close to each other and the player&#x27;s left hand in effect plays as if on one string. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4, a fifth higher. The maximum range of the instrument is three and a half octaves, from D4 up to A7, before a stopping finger reaches the part of the string in contact with the bow hair. The usual playing range is about two and a half octaves.

Various dense and heavy hardwoods are used in making the . According to Chinese references the woods include (, red sandalwood and other woods of the genus &quot;Pterocarpus&quot; such as padauk), (, aged red wood), (, black wood), and (, red wood). Particularly fine are often made from pieces of old furniture. A typical measures from top to bottom, the length of the bow also being 81 cm.

The parts of the are:

* (), sound box or resonator body; it is hexagonal (, southern), octagonal (, northern), or, less commonly, round.
* (), skin, made from python. The python skin gives the its characteristic sound.
* (), neck.
* (), top or tip of neck, usually a simple curve with a piece of bone or plastic on top, but is sometimes elaborately carved with a dragon&#x27;s head.
* (). tuning pegs, traditional wooden, or metal machine gear pegs
* (), nut, made from string, or, less commonly, a metal hook
* (), inside or inner string, usually tuned to D4, nearest to player
* (), outside or outer string, usually tuned to A4
* (), bridge, made from wood
* (), bow, has screw device to vary bow hair tension
* (), bow stick, made from bamboo
* (), bow hair, usually white horsehair
* (), pad, a piece of sponge, felt, or cloth placed between the strings and skin below the bridge to improve its sound
* (), base, a piece of wood attached to the bottom of the to provide a smooth surface on which to rest on the leg

Most are mass-produced in factories. The three most esteemed centres of making are Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. In the collectivist period after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, these factories were formed by merging what had been previously private workshops. Although most were machine-made in production lines, the highest quality instruments were handmade by specialist craftsmen.

In the 20th century, there have been attempts to standardize and improve the , with the aim of producing a louder and better sounding instrument. One major change was the use of steel strings instead of silk. The move to steel strings was made gradually. By 1950 the thinner A-string had been replaced by a violin E-string with the thicker D-string remaining silk. By 1958 professional players were using purpose made D and A steel strings as standard.

===Use of python skin===
In 1988 China passed its Law on the Protection of Endangered Species after ratifying the UN Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), making it illegal to use and trade unlicensed pythons. To regulate the use of python skins, China&#x27;s State Forestry Administration introduced a certification scheme between python skin sellers in Southeast Asia and musical instrument makers in China. From January 1, 2005, new regulations also require to have a certificate from the State Forestry Administration, which certify that the python skin is not made with wild pythons, but from farm-raised pythons. Individuals are allowed to take up to two out of China when traveling; commercial buyers need additional export certificates.

Outside China, manufacturers of can issue their own CITES licenses with approval by governments of their respective countries. Such exports are legal as they have been made from legal skin sources.

Some are made of recycled products.

The Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra began their research for an alternative to python skin in 2005 and has since designed the Eco- series, which substitutes python skin with PET Polyester Membrane. For this innovation the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra received the Ministry of Culture Innovation Award in 2012.

== music==

A notable composer for the was Liú Tiānhuá (, 1895–1932), a Chinese musician who also studied Western music. He composed 47 exercises and 10 solo pieces (1918–1932) which were central to the development of the as a solo instrument. His works for the instrument include (; Moon Night) and (; Shadows of Candles Flickering Red).

Other solo pieces include (1950, Two Springs Reflecting the Moon) by Abing, (Horse Race) by Huang Haihuai, (Henan Folk Tune) by Liu Mingyuan, and (1961, Sanmen Gorge Capriccio) by Liu Wenjin. Most solo works are commonly performed with accompaniment, although pieces such as the ten solos by Liú Tiānhuá and (Two Springs Reflecting the Moon) originally did not have accompaniment.

In addition to the solo repertoire, the is one of the main instruments in regional music ensembles such as , Chinese opera ensembles, and the modern large Chinese orchestra.

The is used in the music of the Cirque du Soleil show &quot;O&quot; and in solo performances in select Shen Yun tours. Even fusion progressive rock groups like The Hsu-nami have incorporated the into their music and it is their lead instrument. It is incorporated in the Taiwanese black metal band ChthoniC and used in the song &quot;Field Below&quot; by Regina Spektor.

An instrumental album by artist Song Fei () expresses the painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival (; ) drawn in the Song dynasty by Zhang Zeduan (). It was performed with the , , , , etc., to show the livelihood, trade, festival of the Song dynasty; the album contains 18 parts.

More recently, the has appeared in several soundtracks, featuring prominently in the TV series &quot;&quot; (played by George Gao) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria&quot; (played by Jiebing Chen). An solo is featured in several cues related to Vulcans from 2009&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; soundtrack by Michael Giacchino.

Musical groups for wedding celebrations in Cambodia often use the Tro, a similar instrument to the .

An is listed in the credits for the Doug Anthony All Stars album &quot;Icon&quot; as being played by Paul McDermott. The erhu can be heard in the character songs of China, a character in &quot;Axis Powers Hetalia&quot;.

In 2020, the release of Genshin Impact, Players around the globe were treated to a mixture of traditional Chinese music and fusion with Western orchestra, including pieces that featured the Erhu.

== Comparisons to Western instruments ==

=== Violin ===
The is often described as a Chinese fiddle. However, when compared to a western fiddle (violin), it has several key differences:

* While most of both instruments are built largely from wood, the bridge and sound production mechanisms differ greatly. The bridge of an has a flat base, and does not require &quot;fitting&quot; onto an instrument. The reason is that the uses a stretched and flattened python skin as its &quot;top&quot;, whereas a violin uses a curved wooden plate.
* The python skin is the primary tone-producing surface of the instrument with either no back or a decorative one, but the violin has a sound post that couples the top and the back&#x27;s vibrations.
* The bow&#x27;s technique also differs. have the hairs of the bow strung between the two strings, and both sides of the bow hair are used. The violin is played with the bow hair placed on top of the strings.
* The has only two strings while violin has four.

==Playing technique==


===Tuning===
The is almost always tuned to the interval of a fifth. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4. This is the same as the two middle strings of the violin.

===Position===
The is played sitting down, with the sound box placed on the top of the left thigh and the neck held vertically, in the similar fashion as that of a cello or double bass player. However, performers of more recent years have played while standing up using a specially developed belt-clip.

===Right hand===
The bow is held with an underhand grip. The bow hair is adjusted so it is slightly loose. The fingers of the right hand are used to push the hairs away from the stick in order to create tension in the hairs. The bow hair is placed in between the two strings and both sides of the bow hair are used to produce sound, the player pushes the bow away from the body when bowing the A string (the outside string), and pulls it inwards when bowing the &quot;inside&quot; D string.

Because the bow rests on the barrel, either string can be bowed with minimal effort; the outer string can be played by pressing the stick downwards with the thumb, and the inner string by pressing the hair towards the player with the middle finger. All other fingers are technically unnecessary and are only used to support and stabilize the bow.

Aside from the bowing technique used for most pieces, the can be plucked, usually using the second finger of the right hand. This produces a dry, muted tone (if either of the open strings is plucked, the sound is somewhat more resonant) which is sometimes used in contemporary pieces such as Horse Race.

===Left hand===
The left hand alters the pitch of the strings by pressing on the string at the desired point. Being a fretless instrument, the player has fine control over tuning. Techniques include (slides), (vibrato), and (changing positions).

==Notable performers==

Prior to the 20th century, most instruments were used primarily to accompany various forms of Chinese opera and narrative. The use of the as a solo instrument began in the early 20th century along with the development of (literally &#x27;national music&#x27;), a modernized form of Chinese traditional music written or adapted for the professional concert stage. Active in the early 20th century were Zhou Shaomei (; 1885–1938) and Liú Tiānhuá. Liú laid the foundations of modern playing with his ten unaccompanied solos and 47 studies composed in the 1920s and 1930s. Liu Beimao (; 1903–1981) was born in Jiangyin, Jiangsu. His compositions include (1943) (Little Flower-drum). Jiang Fengzhi (; 1908–1986) and Chen Zhenduo () were students of Liú Tiānhuá, the piece (Autumn Moon over the Han Palace) was adapted and arranged by Jiang. Hua Yanjun (A Bing) (, 1893–1950) was a blind street musician. Shortly before his death in 1950, two Chinese musicologists recorded him playing a few and solo pieces, the best-known being .

With the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the expansion of the conservatory system, the solo tradition continued to develop. Important performers during this time include Lu Xiutang (; 1911–1966), Zhang Rui (; born 1920), Sun Wenming (; 1928–1962), Huang Haihuai (), Liu Mingyuan (; 1931–1996), Tang Liangde (; 1938–2010), Zhang Shao () and Song Guosheng ().

Liu Mingyuan (; 1931–1996) was born in Tianjin. He was known for his virtuosity on many instruments of the family, in particular the . His compositions and arrangements include (Henan Folk Tune) and (On Grassland) for Zhonghu. For many years, he taught at the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing.

Tang Liangde (Cantonese: Tong Leung Tak; ; 1938–2010) was born in Shanghai into a famous Shanghainese musical family. He won the &quot;Shanghai&#x27;s Spring&quot; competition and continued to be the soloist for the Chinese Film Orchestra in Beijing, his composition and solos can be heard throughout the &quot;Nixon to China&quot; documentary movie. Tang was the soloist and performed at the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, then went on to music broadcasting and education for the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s Music Office making worldwide tours and was named Art Educator of the Year in 1991 by the Hong Kong Artist Guild.

Wang Guotong (; born 1939) was born in Dalian, Liaoning. He studied with Jiang Fengzhi, Lan Yusong and Chen Zhenduo and, in 1960, graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. He performed the premiere of (Sanmen Gorge Rhapsody) composed by Liu Wenjin. In 1972, Wang became the soloist and later art director of the China Broadcasting Traditional Orchestra. He returned to the Central Conservatory of Music in 1983 as head of the Chinese music department. He has written many books and articles on playing and has performed in many countries. Wang also worked with the Beijing National Instruments Factory to further develop design.

Min Huifen (; 1945–2014) was born in Yixing, Jiangsu. She first became known as the winner of the 1963 fourth Shanghai Spring Art Festival.

<doc id="401909" wikidata="Q2722527" url="?curid=401909" title="Battle of Romani">
<text>The Battle of Romani was the last ground attack of the Central Powers on the Suez Canal at the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine campaign during the First World War. The battle was fought between 3 and 5 August 1916 near the Egyptian town of Romani and the site of ancient Pelusium on the Sinai Peninsula, east of the Suez Canal. This victory by the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the Anzac Mounted Division of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) over a joint Ottoman and German force, which had marched across the Sinai, marked the end of the Defence of the Suez Canal campaign, also known as the &quot;Offensive zur Eroberung des Suezkanals&quot; and the &quot;İkinci Kanal Harekâtı&quot;, which had begun on 26 January 1915.

This British Empire victory ensured the safety of the Suez Canal from ground attacks and ended the Central Powers&#x27; plans to disrupt traffic through the canal by gaining control of the strategically important northern approaches to it. The pursuit by the Anzac Mounted Division, which ended at Bir el Abd on 12 August, began the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Thereafter the Anzac Mounted Division supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade were on the offensive, pursuing the German and Ottoman army many miles across the Sinai Peninsula, reversing in a most emphatic manner the defeat suffered at Katia three months earlier.

From late April 1916, after a German-led Ottoman force attacked British yeomanry at the Battle of Katia, British Empire forces in the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the Australian Light Horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On 19 July the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From 20 July until the battle began, the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade and 2nd Light Horse Brigade took turns pushing out to battle the advancing hostile column.

During the night of 3/4 August the advancing force, including the German &quot;Asia Corps&quot; (Pasha I) formation and the Ottoman 3rd Infantry Division, launched an attack from Katia on Romani. Forward troops quickly became engaged with the screen established by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. During fierce fighting before dawn on 4 August, the Australian light horse was forced to slowly retire. At daylight their line was reinforced by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and about mid morning the 5th Mounted Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade joined the battle. Together these four brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division managed to contain and direct the determined German and Ottoman forces into deep sand. Here they came within range of the strongly entrenched 52nd (Lowland) Division defending Romani and the railway.

Coordinated resistance by the EEF formations, the deep sand, the heat and thirst prevailed, and the German, Austrian and Ottoman advance was checked. Although the attacking force fought strongly to maintain its positions the next morning, by nightfall they had been pushed back to their starting point at Katia. The retiring force was pursued by the Anzac Mounted Division between 6 and 9 August, during which the Ottomans and Germans forces fought several determined rearguard actions against the advancing Australian light horse, British yeomanry and New Zealand mounted rifle brigades. The pursuit ended on 12 August, when the German and Ottoman force abandoned their base at Bir el Abd and retreated to El Arish.

== Background ==

At the beginning of the First World War the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915 a German and Ottoman force conducted the First Suez Offensive on the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued to threaten the canal from March through the Gallipoli campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. The German and Ottoman Empires supported the Senussi campaign an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.

By February 1916, there was no sign of any unusual military activity in the Sinai, when the British began construction on the first stretch of standard gauge railway and water pipeline from Kantara to Romani and Katia. Reconnaissance aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps and seaplanes of the Royal Naval Air Service found only small, scattered Ottoman forces in the Sinai region and no sign of any major concentration of troops in southern Palestine.

By the end of March or early in April, the British presence in the Sinai was growing; of track, including sidings, had been laid. Between 21 March and 11 April the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed. In 1915 they had been used by the central group of about 6,000–7,000 Ottoman soldiers who moved across the Sinai Desert to attack the Suez Canal at Ismailia. Without these wells and cisterns, the central route could no longer be used by large forces.

German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein&#x27;s raiding force retaliated to this growing British presence by attacking the widely dispersed 5th Mounted Brigade on 23 April—Easter Sunday and also St George&#x27;s Day—when yeomanry were surprised and overwhelmed at Katia and Oghratina east of Romani. The mounted Yeomanry brigade had been sent to guard the water pipeline and railway as they were being extended beyond the protection of the Suez Canal defences into the desert towards Romani. The British Empire presence in the region was doubled. The next day the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade which had served dismounted during the Gallipoli campaign, of the Australian Major General Harry Chauvel&#x27;s Anzac Mounted Division reoccupied the Katia area unopposed.

== Prelude ==

On 24 April—the day after the Katia and Oghratina—Chauvel, commander of the Anzac Mounted Division, was placed in command of all the advanced troops: the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades at Romani and the 52nd (Lowland) at Dueidar. The infantry moved forward to Romani between 11 May and 4 June 1916.

The building of the railway and pipeline had not been greatly affected by the fighting on 23 April, and by 29 April four trains a day were running regularly to the railhead, manned by No. 276 Railway Company and the main line to Romani was opened on 19 May. A second standard-gauge railway line from Romani to Mahamdiyah on the Mediterranean coast was completed by 9 June. Conditions were extreme; after the middle of May and in particular from mid-June to the end of July, the heat in the Sinai Desert ranged from extreme to fierce, when temperatures could be expected to be in the region of in the shade. The terrible heat was not as bad as the Khamsin dust storms that blow once every 50 days for between a few hours and several days; the air is turned into a haze of floating sand particles flung about by a strong, hot southerly wind.

No major ground operations were carried out during these midsummer months, the Ottoman garrisons in the Sinai being scattered and out of reach of the British forces. Constant patrolling and reconnaissance were carried out from Romani to Ogratina, to Bir el Abd and on 16 May to Bir Bayud, south-east of Romani, on 31 May to Bir Salmana east north-east of Romani by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade, when they covered in 36 hours. These patrols concentrated on an area of great strategic importance to large military formations wishing to move across the Sinai along the northern route. Here water was freely available in a large area of oases which extends from Dueidar, from Kantara on the Suez Canal, along the Darb es Sultani (the old caravan route), to Salmana away.

Between 10 and 14 June, the last water source on the central route across the Sinai Peninsula was destroyed by the Mukhsheib column. This column, consisting of engineers and units of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, the Bikaner Camel Corps, and the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps drained of water from pools and cisterns in the Wadi Mukhsheib and sealed the cisterns. This action narrowed the area in which Ottoman offensives might be expected to the coastal or northern route across the Sinai Peninsula.
Ottoman aircraft attacked the Suez Canal twice during May, dropping bombs on Port Said. British aircraft bombed the town and aerodrome at El Arish on 18 May and 18 June and bombed all the Ottoman camps on a front of parallel to the canal on 22 May. By the middle of June, the 1Squadron, Australian Flying Corps, had begun active service, with &quot;B&quot; Flight at Suez performing reconnaissance. On 9 July, &quot;A&quot; Flight was stationed at Sherika in Upper Egypt, with &quot;C&quot; Flight based at Kantara.

=== German and Ottoman force ===

At the beginning of July, it was estimated there were at least 28,000 Ottoman troops in the Gaza–Beersheba area of southern Palestine, and that just before the battle began at Romani, there were 3,000 troops at Oghratina, not far from Katia, another 6,000 at the forward base of Bir el Abd, east of Oghratina, 2,000 to 3,000 at Bir Bayud to the south-east, and another 2,000 at Bir el Mazar, some to the east, not far from El Arish.

The Ottoman Fourth Army was made up of the 3rd (Anatolian) Infantry Division with three regiments, the 31st, 32nd and 39th Infantry Regiments, totalling 16,000 men, of whom 11,000 to 11,873 were combatants, Arab ancillary forces and one regiment of the Camel Corps. Estimates of their arms range from 3,293 to 12,000 rifles, 38 to 56 machine guns, and two to five anti-aircraft gun sections; they also fielded four heavy artillery and mountain gun batteries (30 artillery pieces) and the Pasha I formation. Nearly 5,000 camels and 1,750 horses accompanied the advance.

Pasha I, with a ration strength of about 16,000, consisted of personnel and materiel for a machine gun battalion of eight companies with four guns each with Ottoman drivers, five anti-aircraft groups, the 60th Battalion Heavy Artillery consisting of one battery of two 100 mm guns, one battery of four 150 mm howitzers and two batteries of 210 mm howitzers (two guns in each battery). The officers, NCOs and &quot;leading numbers&quot; of this artillery battalion were German; the remainder were Ottoman Army personnel. In addition Pasha I also included two trench mortar companies, the 300th Flight Detachment, Wireless detachment, three railway companies and two field hospitals. Austria provided two mountain howitzer batteries of six guns each. With the exception of the two 210 mm howitzers, the trench mortars and the railway personnel the remainder of Pasha I took part in the advance to Romani.

The 300th Flight Detachment provided a squadron for aerial reconnaissance, and increased the numbers of aircraft available to support the advance across Sinai. These Pasha I aircraft were faster and more effective than the &quot;hopelessly outclassed&quot; British aircraft and were able to maintain air superiority over the battleground. It is also possible that the 81st Regiment of the 27th Division advanced to Bir el Abd and took part in the defence of that place. The objectives of the German, Austrian and Ottoman advance were to capture Romani and to then establish a strongly entrenched position opposite Kantara, from which place their heavy artillery would be within range of the Suez Canal. The attacking force assembled in the southern Ottoman Empire at Shellal, north-west of Beersheba, and departed for the Sinai on 9 July; they reached Bir el Abd and Ogratina ten days later.

=== British forces ===
General Sir Archibald Murray, the commander of the British Empire forces in Egypt, formed the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) in March by merging the Force in Egypt, which had protected Egypt since the beginning of the war, with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force which had fought at Gallipoli. The role of this new force was to both defend the British Protectorate of Egypt and provide reinforcements for the Western Front. Murray had his headquarters in Cairo to better deal with his multiple responsibilities, although he was at Ismailia during the battle for Romani.

With the occupation of Romani, the area became part the Northern or No. 3 Sector of the Suez Canal defences, which originally stretched along the canal from Ferdan to Port Said. Two further sectors grouped the defence forces along the central and southern sections of the Canal; No. 2, the Central Sector, stretched south from Ferdan to headquarters at Ismailia and on to Kabrit, where the No. 1 or Southern Sector extended from Kabrit to Suez.
Murray considered it very unlikely that an attack would occur anywhere other than in the northern sector and therefore was prepared to reduce the troops in Nos 1 and 2 Sectors to a minimum. He decided not to reinforce his four infantry brigades, but to increase the available fire-power at Romani by moving up the 160th and 161st Machine Gun Companies of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions. He also ordered the concentration of a small mobile column made up of the 11th Light Horse, the City of London Yeomanry (less one squadron each) with the 4th, 6th and 9th Companies of the Imperial Camel Brigade in No. 2 Sector. He calculated that the whole of the defensive force, including the camel transport necessary to enable infantry in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division to advance into the desert, would be fully equipped and the camels assembled by 3 August. Approximately 10,000 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels concentrated at Romani prior to the battle. British monitors in the Mediterranean Sea off Mahamdiyah got into position to shell the assembling Ottoman force, while an armoured train at Kantara was ready to assist the defence of the right flank, and all available aircraft were on standby at Ismailia, Kantara, Port Said and Romani.
Major General H. A. Lawrence commanded No. 3 Section Canal Defences, and as part of those defences, the Romani position was commanded by Lawrence, who had his headquarters at Kantara. Stationed at Kantara were infantry in the 42nd Division, an infantry brigade of the 53rd (Welsh) Division with 36 guns and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, detached from the Anzac Mounted Division. Lawrence moved two infantry battalions of the 42nd Division from No. 2 Section Canal defences to Kantara, and sent infantry in the 158th (North Wales) Brigade of the 53rd (Welsh) Division to Romani on 20 July.

The deployments on 3 August on and near the battlefield were as follows:
* at Hill 70, southwest from Romani, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (less the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, but with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s 5th Light Horse Regiment, temporarily attached), commanded by Edward Chaytor, and the 5th Mounted Brigade, under the direct command of Lawrence, were joined on the railway by infantry in the 126th (East Lancashire) Brigade (42nd Division). Together with the 5th Light Horse Regiment, attached to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade at Dueidar, to the east of Hill 70, this force was to stop or delay von Kressenstein&#x27;s attack should he attempt to bypass Romani and advance directly towards the Suez Canal,
* at Hill 40, a little further southwest of Hill 70, infantry from the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade and the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (42nd Division) were also on the railway line at Gilban Station,
* the Mobile Column was based in the Sinai at the end of the El Ferdan railway, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was at Ballybunion, also in the Sinai at the end of the Ballah railway.
* The force at Romani, responsible for its defence when the battle began, consisted of infantry from the British 52nd (Lowland) Division, commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, and the Anzac Mounted Division commanded by Chauvel (less the 3rd Light Horse Brigade). The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, (less the 5th Light Horse Regiment, but with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade&#x27;s Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment attached) were commanded by Lieutenant Colonels J. B. H Meredith and J. R. Royston respectively.

=== Development of defensive positions ===

Infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division joined the two mounted brigades at Romani between 11 May and 4 June, when the development of the railway made it possible to transport and supply such a large number of soldiers. The infantry occupied a defensive position known as Wellington Ridge, facing a tangle of sand dunes. The area favoured defence; sand dunes, stretching about inland, covered an area of , including, to the south of Romani, the northern route from El Arish. On the southern and south eastern edges, a series of dunes of shifting sand with narrow sloping lanes led to a tableland of deep soft sand.

The 52nd (Lowland) Division developed a strong defensive position at Romani which had its left flank on the Mediterranean Sea, here a series of redoubts were built running southwards from Mahamdiyah along the line of high sand hills about to a dune known as Katib Gannit high. This line of sand hills, which were high enough to see Katia oasis from, marked the eastern edge of an area of very soft and shifting sand beyond which were lower dunes and harder sand where movement by both infantry and mounted forces was considerably easier. Between the shore at the western end of the Bardawil Lagoon and Katib Gannit (the principal tactical point on the eastern slopes of the Romani heights), the infantry constructed a line of 12 redoubts about apart, with a second series of redoubts covering the Romani railway station and the right of the defensive position which curved like a hook westward, then northward. A total of 18 redoubts were constructed, which when fully garrisoned held from 40 to 170 rifles each, with Lewis guns and an average of two Vickers machine guns allotted to each position; they were well wired on the right side of each of the positions, although there was no wire between the redoubts. This defensive line was supported by artillery.
The threat of an Ottoman attack towards the Suez Canal had been considered by Lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders, and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns. Their plans took into account the possibility of an Ottoman army at Katia moving to attack Romani or following the old caravan route to assault Hill 70 and Dueidar on their way to the Suez Canal. Any attempt to bypass Romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison, which could send out infantry and mounted troops on the hard ground in the plain to the south-west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was stationed at Hill 70 at the end of June and the 5th Light Horse Regiment at Dueidar to prevent such an Ottoman force from reaching the Suez Canal.

=== Light Horse patrols before the battle ===

Active patrolling by mounted troops continued throughout the period leading up to the battle, but by early July, there were no indications of any imminent resumption of hostilities. The nearest Ottoman garrison of 2,000 men was at Bir el Mazar east of Romani, and on 9 July, a patrol found Bir Salmana unoccupied. However, greatly increased aerial activity over the Romani area began about 17 July, when faster and better-climbing German aircraft quickly established superiority over British aircraft. But they could not stop British aircraft from continuing to reconnoitre the country to the east, and on 19 July, a British aircraft, with Brigadier General E. W. C. Chaytor (commander of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) acting as observer, discovered an Ottoman force of about 2,500 at Bir Bayud. A slightly smaller force was detected at Gameil and another similar sized force was found at Bir el Abd with about 6,000 camels seen at the camps or moving between Bir el Abd and Bir Salmana. The next morning, 3,000 men were found to be entrenched at Mageibra, with an advance depot for supplies and stores at Bir el Abd. A small force was spotted as far forward as the oasis of Oghratina, which by the next day, 21 July, had grown to 2,000 men.

On 20 July, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade with two guns mounted on ped-rails of the Ayrshire Battery demonstrated against Oghratina, capturing several prisoners, and beginning a series of patrols which, together with the 1st Light Horse Brigade, they continued until the eve of battle. Every day until 3 August, these two brigades alternated riding out from their base at Romani towards Katia at about 02:00 and bivouacking until dawn, at which time they advanced on a wide front until German or Ottoman fire was provoked. If the enemy position was weak, the light horse pushed forward, and if a counterattack began, the brigade retired slowly, thereafter to return to camp at Romani at nightfall. The following day, the other brigade carried out similar manoeuvres in the direction of Katia and the advancing Ottoman columns, picking up the officers patrols which had been left out during the night to monitor enemy movements. During this period, one of many clashes occurred on 28 July at Hod Um Ugba, from the British line. Two squadrons of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W. Meldrum, made a bayonet assault, supported by several machine guns and two 18-pounder guns. They drove the Ottomans from the Hod, leaving 16 dead and taking eight prisoners from the Ottoman 31st Infantry Regiment.
The tactic of continuous forward patrolling was so successful that the advancing force&#x27;s every move was known to the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance. By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were within striking distance of Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal. Their line ran north-east and south-west from the Bardawil Lagoon to east of Katia, with their left flank thrown well forward.

=== Plans ===

The German and Ottoman objective was not to cross the canal, but to capture Romani and establish a strongly entrenched heavy artillery position opposite Kantara, from which to bombard shipping on the canal. Kress von Kressenstein&#x27;s plan for the attack on Romani was to bombard the line of defensive redoubts with heavy artillery and employ only weak infantry detachments against them, while his main force launched attacks against the right and rear of the Romani position. The defenders expected the German and Ottoman attack to be one of containment against their prepared line of defence, and an all-out attack on the right south of Katib Gannit. They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray&#x27;s plan was to firstly delay the attackers and make it very difficult for them to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force was committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.

Chauvel had selected a position for the defence of Romani, which stretched for between Katib Gannit and Hod el Enna, with a second fall-back position covering a series of parallel gullies running south-east and north-west giving access to the area of soft sand to the rear of the Romani defences. No visible works were constructed, but together with Chauvel, the commanders of the two light horse brigades, whose task it would be to hold the attackers on this ground until the flank attack could begin, studied the area closely.

== Battle on 4 August ==
Just before midnight on 3/4 August, three columns of the German Pasha I and the 4th Ottoman Army, consisting of about 8,000 men, began their attack on an outpost line held by the 1st Light Horse Brigade three and a half hours after the return of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade from their regular daytime patrol. In addition to the usual officers patrols left out overnight to monitor the enemy&#x27;s positions, Chauvel decided to leave out for the night the whole of the 1st Light Horse Brigade to hold an outpost line of about 3 miles (4.8 km), covering all entrances to the sandhill plateau which formed the Romani position and which were not protected by infantry posts.

A shot or two fired out in the desert to the south-east of their position put the long piquet line of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) on alert about midnight, when the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) was called up to the front line. The Austrian, German and Ottoman advance paused after finding the gullies held by the light horsemen, but at about 01:00, a sudden heavy burst of fire along the whole front began the attack of the considerably superior Ottoman and German forces, and by 02:00 they had in many places advanced to within of the Australian line.
The Ottoman centre and left columns were skilfully led round the open flank of the infantry&#x27;s entrenchments and on towards the camp and railway. After the moon had set at around 02:30, the Germans and Ottomans made a bayonet charge on Mount Meredith. Although vastly outnumbered, the light horsemen fought an effective delaying action at close quarters, but were forced to relinquish ground slowly and to ultimately evacuate the position by 03:00. Without the benefit of moon light, the light horsemen had fired at the flashes of the enemy&#x27;s rifles until they were close enough to use bayonets. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was eventually forced back; withdrawing slowly, troop covering troop with steady accurate fire, staving off a general attack with the bayonet to their fall-back position; a large east/west sand dune called Wellington Ridge at the southern edge of the Romani encampment. During the retirement to Wellington Ridge, the covering squadrons on the left near Katib Gannit were also attacked, as was the squadron on the right, which was taken in the flank and suffered considerable loss, but managed to hold its ground until the position in its rear was occupied. By 03:30, all light horsemen south of Mount Meredith had been forced back to their led horses and had succeeded in disengaging and falling back to their second position. Soon after, an Ottoman machine gun was shooting down on the light horse from Mount Meredith.

Chauvel had relied on the steadiness of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, which he had commanded during the Gallipoli campaign, to hold the line against greatly superior numbers for four hours until dawn, when the general situation could be assessed. Daylight revealed the weakness of the light horse defenders in their second position on Wellington Ridge and that their right was outflanked by strong German and Ottoman forces. At 04:30, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, commanded by Colonel J. R. Royston, was ordered up by Chauvel from Etmaler and went into action in front of Mount Royston to support and prolong the 1st Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s right flank by moving up the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments into the front line. German, Austrian or Ottoman artillery now opened fire on the infantry defences and camps in the rear; shrapnel inflicted some losses, but the high explosive shells were smothered by the soft sand. The attackers succeeded in forcing the light horse off Wellington Ridge, which placed them within of the Romani camp. However, they were unable to press further, as they now became exposed to machine gun and rifle fire from the entrenched infantry of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, and shelling from the horse artillery supporting the light horsemen&#x27;s determined defence.

Having been held south of Romani, the German and Ottoman force attempted a further outflanking manoeuvre to the west, concentrating 2,000 troops around Mount Royston another sand dune, south-west of Romani. At 05:15, the Ottoman 31st Infantry Regiment pushed forward; then the 32nd and the 39th Infantry Regiments swung around the left and into the British rear. This outflanking movement was steadily progressing along the slopes of Mount Royston and turning the right of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, whose third regiment, the Wellington Mounted Rifles, was now also committed to the front line.

The two brigades of light horse continued to gradually withdraw, pivoting on the extreme right of the infantry position, which covered the left flank and rear of Romani. They were pushed back between Wellington Ridge and Mount Royston, about west of the former; the attackers continually forcing back their right flank. Between 05:00 and 06:00, they were compelled to also retire slowly from this ridge, although the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) still held the western edge. At 06:15, Meredith was ordered to withdraw the 1st Light Horse Brigade behind the line occupied by the 7th Light Horse Regiment north of Etmaler camp. At 07:00, the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments retired, squadron by squadron, from the remainder of Wellington Ridge. By about 08:00, German, Austrian and Ottoman fire from the ridge top was directed into the camp only a few hundred yards away, but the Ayrshire and Leicester Batteries quickly stopped this artillery attack.

It became apparent that the German and Ottoman right column, (31st Infantry Regiment) was attempting a frontal attack on redoubts held by infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The defenders were able to hold on, but were subjected to severe artillery shelling during the day. Frontal attacks began with heavy German or Austrian fire by their artillery which attempted to breach the infantry defensive line. About 08:00, attacks were being made on Numbers 4 and 5 redoubts which began with heavy artillery fire, but the attacks broke completely when the 31st Ottoman Infantry Regiment were within of No. 4 redoubt; subsequent attempts were less successful. At about 10:00, Chauvel contacted Brigadier General E. S. Girdwood, commanding 156th Infantry Brigade, requesting his brigade temporarily relieve the light horse brigades until they had watered their horses in preparation for a mounted counterattack. Girdwood refused because his brigade was being held in reserve to support an intended attack eastward by infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division.

The light horse had gradually withdrawn back until, at about 11:00, the main German and Ottoman attack was stopped by well directed fire from the Royal Horse Artillery batteries of the Anzac Mounted Division and by light horse rifle and machine gun fire, to which the 52nd (Lowland) Division contributed considerable firepower. The attackers appeared to have exhausted themselves, but they held their ground while Austrian and Ottoman artillery of various calibres, including 5.9&quot; and 10.5 cm guns, fired on the defenders and their camps, and German and Ottoman aircraft severely bombed the defenders. The three columns of the German, Austrian and Ottoman attacking force were brought to a standstill by the coordinated, concerted and determined defence of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades and the 52nd (Lowland) Division.

The Ottoman advance was at a standstill everywhere. After a long night&#x27;s march, the German and Ottoman troops faced a difficult day under the desert sun without being able to replenish their water and exposed to artillery fire from Romani. At this time, the attacking forces held a line running from the Bardawil (on the Mediterranean coast) southward along the front of the 52nd Infantry Division&#x27;s entrenchments and then westward through and including the very large sand dunes of Mount Meredith and Mount Royston. But from their position on Mount Royston, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force dominated the camp area of Romani and threatened the railway line.

=== Reinforcements ===
Chaytor, commander of the New Zealander Mounted Rifles Brigade, had been advised of the Austrian, German and Ottoman advance against Romani at 02:00. By 05:35, Lawrence at his headquarters of the Northern No. 3 Canal Defences Sector at Kantara, had been informed of the developing attack. He recognised that the main blow was falling on Romani and ordered the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade at Hill 70 to move towards Mount Royston. They were led by a Composite Regiment, which moved off at once, the remainder of the brigade preparing to follow. At 07:25, Lawrence ordered the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade consisting of brigade headquarters and the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment (less the Auckland Mounted Rifles and the attached 5th Light Horse Regiments, 2nd Light Horse Brigade), to move towards Mount Royston via Dueidar and there, pick up the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment. The Yeomanry and New Zealand brigades had both been stationed at Hill 70, from Romani, when their orders to move were received. The New Zealanders were to &quot;operate vigorously so as to cut off the enemy, who appears to have got round the right of the Anzac Mounted Division.&quot;

Meanwhile, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Ballybunion was directed to move forward to Hill 70 and send one regiment to Dueidar, while the Mobile Column was ordered by GHQ to march towards Mageibra.

=== Mount Royston counterattack ===
The German, Austrian and Ottoman attack on Mount Royston was checked to the north by the 3rd and 6th Light Horse Regiments (1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades), and under constant bombardment from the horse artillery and the infantry&#x27;s heavy artillery of the 52nd (Lowland) Division. At 10:00, the front held by the two light horse brigades faced south from a point northwest of No. 22 Redoubt north of Wellington Ridge to the sand hills north of Mount Royston. As the line had fallen back, the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Regiments (1st Light Horse Brigade) had come in between the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade); from right to left, the line was now held by the 6th, 3rd, 2nd and 7th Light Horse and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments, while north north-west of Mount Royston, &quot;D&quot; Squadron of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars (a regiment in the 5th Mounted Brigade) held its ground.


The plan called for the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, the 5th Mounted and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades to swing round the attackers&#x27; left flank and envelop them. The first reinforcements to arrive were the Composite Regiment of the 5th Mounted Brigade; they came up on the flank of their mounted regiment; the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars&#x27; &quot;D&quot; Squadron west of Mount Royston, which was being attacked by a strong body of Ottoman soldiers. The regiment attacked the Ottomans in enfilade and forced them back.

When the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade&#x27;s headquarters and the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiments were within of Dueidar on the old caravan road, they were ordered to move directly to Canterbury Hill, the last defensible position in front of the railway, east of Pelusium Station, as the strong German and Ottoman attack was threatening to take the railway and Romani. The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment arrived with its brigade between 11:00 and 11:30 to find the Composite Yeomanry Regiment (5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade) in contact with the German and Ottoman forces on the south-west side of Mount Royston.

The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades first made contact with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade by heliograph, after which Royston, commanding the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, galloped across to explain the situation. Chaytor then moved the Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiments, supported by the Somerset Battery, onto high ground between the right of the light horse and the Yeomanry, which was shortly afterwards joined by the remainder of the 5th Mounted Brigade under the command of Brigadier General Wiggin. At the most critical period of the day&#x27;s fighting, when the German and Ottoman force of 2,000 dominated the Romani area from Mount Royston, the five mounted brigades (still less the 5th Light Horse Regiment) began their counterattack at 14:00 from the west towards Mount Royston.
The New Zealand riflemen soon gained a footing on Mount Royston, aided by accurate and rapid shooting from the Somerset Royal Horse Artillery Battery. By 16:00, the attack had proceeded to a point where Chaytor arranged with the 5th Mounted Brigade for a squadron of Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and two troops of the Worcestershire Yeomanry to gallop against the southern spur of Mount Royston. They easily took the spur, the defenders not waiting for the onslaught of the mounted charge. From the crest of the spur, the Gloucestershire squadron shot down the horse teams of an Austrian, German or Ottoman battery of pack guns concentrated in the hollow behind the spur, and the attacking force began to surrender. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades were supported by leading infantry battalions of the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (which had just arrived) when Ottoman and German soldiers began to surrender en masse. At about 18:00, 500 prisoners, two machine guns and the pack battery were captured, and the outer flank of the attacking force was completely routed.

Meanwhile, the inner flank of the German and Ottoman force on Wellington Ridge made a last effort to advance across the ridge, but was driven back by artillery fire. Fresh frontal attacks launched against the main British infantry system of redoubts broke down completely. At 17:05, Major General Smith ordered infantry in the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade to attack the enemy force on Wellington Ridge on the left of the light horse and in coordination with the counterattack on Mount Royston. An artillery bombardment of Wellington Ridge began at 18:45. Just before 19:00, infantry in the 7th and 8th Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) moved south from behind No. 23 Redoubt; the 8th Scottish Rifles advancing to within of the crest of Wellington Ridge, before being stopped by heavy rifle fire.

When darkness put an end to the fighting, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades established an outpost line and spent the night on the battlefield, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 5th Mounted Brigades withdrew for water and rations at Pelusium Station, where the newly arrived infantry brigades of the 42nd Division were assembling. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade halted at Hill 70, while the Mobile Force had reached the Hod el Bada, south of Romani station. At 19:30, when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at Pelusium, the area was consolidated by infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade, 42nd Division. Brigadier General Girdwood ordered infantry in the 7th and 8th Scottish Rifles Battalions to hold their ground on Wellington Ridge until daylight, but to keep close contact with the enemy during the night in the hope of capturing large numbers of tired and disorganised soldiers in the morning. Approximately 1,200 unwounded prisoners were captured during the day and sent to the Pelusium railway station.

== Battle on 5 August ==
Within 24 hours, British commanders were able to concentrate a force of 50,000 men in the Romani area, a three to one advantage. This force included the two infantry divisions—the 52nd and the newly arrived 42nd—four mounted brigades, two of which had been on active duty since 20 July, and two heavily engaged on the front line the day before, and may have included the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, although it was still at Hill 70, and the Mobile Column at Hod el Bada. At this time, command of the 5th Mounted Brigade passed from the Anzac Mounted Division to the infantry division; the 42nd Division, it being suggested that orders required the Anzac Mounted Division to remain in position, and that the 3rd Light Horse Brigade alone was to make a flank attack.

However, Lawrence&#x27;s orders for a general advance on 5 August beginning at 04:00 included an advance by the Anzac Mounted Division. His orders read:
* Anzac Mounted Division to press forward with its right on the Hod el Enna and its left in close touch with the infantry from the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division, advancing on the line Katib Gannit to Mount Meredith.
* 3rd Light Horse Brigade to move towards Bir el Nuss and attack Hod el Enna from the south keeping in close touch with the Anzac Mounted Division.
* 5th Mounted Brigade, under orders of 42nd Infantry Division to assist the 3rd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s link with the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s right.
* 42nd Division to move on the line Canterbury Hill–Mount Royston–Hod el Enna and drive back any opposition to the advance of the mounted troops in close support of Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s right flank.
* 52nd (Lowland) Division to move in close support of Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s left flank towards Mount Meredith and to prepare for a general advance towards Abu Hamra which was not to be undertaken until further orders from Lawrence at No. 3 Section Headquarters.

Meanwhile, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force was now spread from Hill 110 almost to Bir en Nuss, but with their left flank unprotected. They could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. Had the British infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction, von Kressenstein&#x27;s force would have had great difficulty escaping.

=== British capture Wellington Ridge ===
At daybreak, infantry in the 8th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division) advanced with the 7th Light Horse and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade), covered by infantry in the 7th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left, who had brought 16 machine guns and Lewis guns into a position from which they could sweep the crest and reverse slopes of Wellington Ridge. The Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, with the 7th Light Horse Regiment and supported on the left by Scottish Rifles&#x27; infantry posts, fixed bayonets and stormed Wellington Ridge. They encountered heavy rifle and machine gun fire, but rushed up the sandy slope and quickly broke through the German and Ottoman front line. After clearing Wellington Ridge, the mounted riflemen, light horsemen and infantrymen pressed forward from ridge to ridge without pause. These troops swept down on a body of about 1,000 to 1,500 Ottoman soldiers, who became demoralised. As a result of this attack, a white flag was hoisted and by 05:00 the German and Ottoman soldiers who had stubbornly defended their positions on Wellington Ridge, dominating the camps at Romani, were captured. A total of 1,500 became prisoners in the neighbourhood of Wellington Ridge; 864 soldiers surrendered to infantry in the 8th Scottish Rifles alone, while others were captured by the light horse and mounted rifles regiments. By 05:30, the main German and Ottoman force was in a disorganised retreat towards Katia, with the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades and the Ayrshire and Leicestershire batteries not far behind. At 06:00, a further 119 men surrendered to the infantry in No. 3 Redoubt; while these prisoners were being dealt with, it became apparent that they were part of a rearguard and that a full retreat was under way. At 06:30, Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all troops and to initiate a vigorous general advance eastwards.

=== British advance on Ottoman rearguard at Katia ===

Infantry from the 42nd Division had arrived during the battle the day before by train from Hill 70, Hill 40 and Gilban Station, and along with infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division, was ordered to move out in support of the mounted Australian, New Zealand and British Yeomanry brigades. The 42nd Division was ordered to advance to Hod el Enna; their 127th (Manchester) Brigade marched out at 07:30 and reached Hod el Enna between 09:30 and 10:00, while their 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade arrived at 11:15. They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water. In much distress in the scorching midsummer sands, infantry in the 42nd Division marched very slowly and far in the rear. The 52nd (Lowland) Division also experienced difficulties; although Lawrence ordered the division to move at 06:37, the men did not leave their trenches until nearly midday, reaching their objective of Abu Hamra late in the evening. As a result, Kress von Kressenstein was able to extricate most of his troops and heavy guns from the immediate battle area during the day. Although it has been stated that &quot;British reserves hammered&quot; the Germans and Ottomans to a halt on 5 August, it appears one of the infantry divisions was reluctant to leave their defences; neither infantry division were trained in desert warfare and found the sand dunes extremely difficult to negotiate. They could not match the pace and endurance of the well-trained German and Ottoman force and were hampered by water supply problems.

At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were somewhat scattered. By 08:30, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had reached Bir en Nuss; there they found the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been ordered to move first on Hamisah and then left towards Katia to cooperate in a general attack. The advance guard moved to fulfill these orders at 09:00. At 10:30, the general mounted advance began and by midday, was on a line from west of Bir Nagid to south of Katib Gannit; in the centre the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade were approaching the south-west edge of the Katia oasis; on their left the 1st, the 2nd Light Horse, the 5th Mounted Brigades and infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were attacking Abu Hamra, to the north of the old caravan road, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was away to the New Zealander&#x27;s right, south of the old caravan road, attacking German and Ottoman units at Bir el Hamisah.

Between 12:00 and 13:00, the commanders of the New Zealand Mounted Rifle, 1st and 2nd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades reconnoitred the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard position west of Katia. It was decided that the three light horse brigades would advance mounted with the Yeomanry to attack the German and Ottoman right flank. The rearguard force made a very determined stand on a well-prepared line, stretching from Bir El Hamisah to Katia and on to Abu Hamra. Their artillery and machine guns were well placed in the palms fringing the eastern side of a great flat marsh, which stretched right across the front of their position, giving them an excellent field of fire.

A general mounted attack commenced at 14:30. By 15:30, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were advancing at the gallop on Katia. When they had reached the edge of the white gypsum, the light horse and mounted rifle brigades formed a line, fixed bayonets, and charged over the exposed country. They galloped in a long line of charging horses, through shell fire and bullets, holding fixed bayonets. On the far left, the intensity of fire from the rearguard made it necessary for the 5th Mounted Brigade of sword carrying Yeomanry to send back their horses and advance dismounted. While all the brigades which charged, were eventually forced to attack dismounted also, when the ground became too swampy. They were met by well-directed, heavy German, Austrian and Ottoman artillery fire, which completely outgunned the supporting Ayrshire and Somerset Batteries; by sunset, the advance of the British Empire mounted brigades had been stopped. The 9th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) on the extreme right was held up by a determined German and Ottoman rearguard and was unable to work round the right flank of that position. But after galloping to within a few hundred yards of the rearguard&#x27;s line, they made a dismounted bayonet attack under cover of machine gun fire and the Inverness Battery. As a result, the German and Ottoman force abandoned their position, leaving 425 men and seven machine guns to be captured. But, instead of holding their ground, they drew off, and this withdrawal led to a strong German and Ottoman counterattack falling on the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment.

Darkness finally put an end to the battle. During the night, the Germans, Austrians and Ottomans withdrew back to Oghrantina, while the Anzac Mounted Division watered at Romani, leaving a troop of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment as a listening post on the battlefield.

The two-day battle for Romani and the Suez Canal had been won by the British infantry and Australian, British and New Zealand mounted troops. They captured approximately 4,000 German and Ottoman combatants and killed more than 1,200, but the main enemy force was able to escape with all their artillery, except for one captured battery, and retreat back to Oghratina after fighting a successful rearguard action at Katia.

Having borne the burden of the long days of patrolling, reconnaissance and minor engagements with the advancing Austrian, German and Ottoman columns prior to the battle, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades had alone withstood the attack from midnight on 3/4 August until dawn on 4 August, as well as continuing to fight during the long days of battle. By the end of 5 August, they were completely exhausted; their depleted ranks stumbled back to their bivouac lines at Romani and Etmaler where they were ordered one day&#x27;s rest.

== Pursuit ==

Kressenstein had prepared successive lines of defence during his advance towards Romani, and despite losing one artillery battery and more than one third of his soldiers, fought a series of effective rearguard actions which slowed the pursuit by British Empire mounted troops and enabled his force to retreat back to El Arish. During the night of 5/6 August, infantry in the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade and 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade were at Abu Hamra, the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (42nd Division) at Hod el Enna, the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade (42nd Division) on its left in touch with the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, (52nd Division) which had its left on Redoubt No. 21. The next morning, infantry in the 42nd Division was ordered to advance eastwards at 04:00 and occupy a line from Bir el Mamluk to Bir Katia, while the 52nd (Lowland) Division was to advance from Abu Hamra and prolong the infantry line of the 42nd Division to the north-east. Although they carried out their orders during their two-day march from Pelusium Station to Katia, infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade lost 800 men, victims to thirst and the sun; other infantry brigades suffered similarly.

It became clear that the infantry could not go on, and they ceased to be employed in the advance. It was necessary for the Bikanir Camel Corps and Yeomanry detachments, as well as the medical services, to search the desert for those who had been left behind. The Mobile Column in the south, consisting of the Imperial Camel Brigade, the 11th Light Horse, and the mounted City of London Yeomanry Regiments (less two squadrons), advanced from Ferdan and the Ballah railhead to attack the German and Ottoman left flank, working through Bir El Mageibra, Bir El Aweidia and Hod El Bayud. They found Mageibra evacuated on 5 August. After camping there for the night, they fought strong hostile forces between Bayud and Mageibra the following day, but could make no impression. Some days later, on 8 August, the Mobile Column did succeed in getting round the Ottoman flank, but was too weak to have any effect and retired to Bir Bayud.

=== Advance towards Oghratina – 6 August ===

During the previous night, the German and Ottoman force evacuated Katia and was moving towards Oghratina when Chauvel ordered the Anzac Mounted Division to continue the attack. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades and the 5th Mounted Brigade were ordered to capture Oghratina. Despite attempts by these two brigades to turn the enemy flank, they were forced to make a frontal attack on strongly entrenched rearguards in positions which favoured the defenders and which were supported by carefully positioned artillery. Meanwhile, the two infantry divisions moved to garrison Katia and Abu Hamra and Lawrence moved his headquarters forward from Kantara to Romani. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right advanced towards Badieh, but could only make small progress, against positions securely held by German and Ottoman forces.

The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had moved out at dawn, followed by the 5th Mounted Brigade without ambulance support, as the New Zealand Field Ambulance had not returned from Romani and the 5th Mounted Field Ambulance had not yet arrived. Fortunately, casualties were light, and both ambulances arrived in the evening. The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, had formed a dressing station at Bir Nagid to the south of Romani, treating wounded from 3rd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s engagement at Bir el Hamisah, a convoy brought in wounded Ottomans from a hod to the south of Romani, and 150 cases of heat exhaustion from infantry in the 42nd Division were treated during the day.

=== Oghratina entered on 7 August ===
The same three brigades—one mounted rifle, one light horse and one Yeomanry, with the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) supporting the Yeomanry—moved to attack the German and Ottoman position at Oghratina, but the rearguard position was again found to be too strong. Lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery, the mounted force was too small to capture this strong rearguard position, but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position. During the night, the German and Ottoman forces retreated back to Bir el Abd, where they had been three weeks before, on 20 July, when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores.

On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.

=== Debabis occupied on 8 August ===
The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade reached Debabis on 8 August. As the 3rd Light Horse Brigade came up, they passed many dead Ottomans and Yeomanry; one dead Ottoman sniper had a heap of hundreds of rounds of empty cartridge shells beside him. Meanwhile, the Bikanir Camel Corps and a squadron of aircraft continued searching the desert sands for missing men.

== Action of Bir el Abd – 9 to 12 August ==

Chauvel planned, with Lawrence&#x27;s approval, to capture the Ottoman rearguard at their forward base of Bir El Abd, to the east of Romani. The position was strongly held by greatly superior numbers of Germans, Austrians and Ottomans, supported by well-placed artillery, but the garrison was seen burning stores and evacuating camps.

Chauvel deployed the Anzac Mounted Division for the advance, with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in the centre following the telegraph line. On their right, with a gap of , was the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which was in touch with a small flying column; the Mobile Column of the City of London Yeomanry, 11th Light Horse Regiments and the Imperial Camel Brigade, which was to again attempt to get round the German and Ottoman left flank and cut off their retreat. The advance of the 3rd Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Brigades from Oghratina to Bir el Abd was to begin at daylight on 9 August, with the 5th Mounted Brigade forming the reserve. On the left of the New Zealanders, Royston&#x27;s Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. They were to bivouac for one and a half hours before advancing to a point north-east of Bir el Abd, to cooperate with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade&#x27;s attack on the rearguard position at 06:30. Since the attack, supported by only four horse artillery batteries, was on a prepared position held in superior strength, strong in machine guns, and covered by double the number of guns, including heavy howitzers, it was something of a gamble. The attacking force&#x27;s only advantage was its mobility.

=== Attack on 9 August ===

The 3rd Light Horse Brigade set out to find and turn the German and Ottoman left, while at 04:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade headed directly towards Bir el Abd along the old caravan route. By 05:00, they had driven in enemy outposts and reached high ground overlooking Bir el Abd. Royston&#x27;s Column moved off at 05:00 with the intention of enveloping the Ottoman right, while the New Zealanders attacked in the centre; the four brigades covering a front of .

The forward troops of the German and Ottoman rearguard, which held a front of about , were driven back to Bir el Abd by the New Zealanders. At this time, the attackers appeared likely to succeed, as they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road, supported by the Somerset and Leicester batteries. But the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was, and at 09:00 advanced out of their trenches to counterattack. This aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the Somerset Battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns. The subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position, and on the flanks the light horse were also held up. The German and Ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards a gap between the New Zealanders and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, but the 5th Light Horse Regiment covered the gap, and the German and Ottoman advance was halted.

Chauvel ordered the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been unable to turn the German and Ottoman flank, to move towards the New Zealanders who renewed their efforts, but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks, as the Australians were unable to conform to their forward movement. By 10:30, all progress had stopped. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade continued to hold on in the centre, while both flanks were bent back by pressure from the strong German and Ottoman force. The result was that the New Zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on the forward slopes of the hills overlooking the Hod. Fresh German or Ottoman reinforcements from El Arish, then launched a fierce counterattack on a front of about , on the centre. This fell on the Canterbury and Auckland Regiments and a squadron of Warwickshire Yeomanry of the 5th Mounted Brigade under Chaytor&#x27;s command. The New Zealanders were supported by machine guns; one section, attached to the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment, fired all their guns directly on the advancing soldiers, stopping them when they were within of the New Zealand position.

By midday, the advance had been completely held up by determined counterattacks supported by fresh German or Ottoman troops from El Arish. Even more than at Katia on 5 August, these soldiers were more numerous, ready, full of fight and more strongly supported by well-placed Austrian and Ottoman guns delivering both heavy and accurate fire. At this time, the rearguard launched another heavy counterattack with two columns of 5,000 and 6,000 German and Ottoman soldiers against the Canterbury and Auckland Regiments and the squadron of the Warwickshire Yeomanry. By 14:00, the attack had extended to the mounted force&#x27;s left flank where the Ayrshire Battery with Royston&#x27;s Column was badly cut up by this fire, losing 39 horses killed and making it extremely difficulty to move the guns. They were forced to retire nearly and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, after advancing well up on the right flank, was also forced to give ground by the accuracy of enemy shellfire.

A further withdrawal by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade made the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade&#x27;s position critical and at 17:30, Chauvel gave orders for a general retirement. Disengagement proved to be a challenge; it was only the tenacity of the New Zealanders and nightfall which saved them from certain capture. At the last, the Machine Gun Squadron had all its guns in line, some of them firing at a range of ; they were supported by squadrons of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which together, successfully covered the New Zealanders&#x27; withdrawal.

After this day of fierce fighting, which has been described as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence&#x27;s wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.

=== Planned attack for 12 August ===
At daylight on 10 August, strong patrols went forward and remained in touch with the force at Bir el Abd throughout the day, but without fresh troops, an attack in force could not be made.

No serious fighting took place on 11 August, but von Kressenstein&#x27;s force at Bir el Abd was watched and harassed, and plans were made for an attack on 12 August. The advance of the Anzac Mounted Division began at daylight, but soon afterwards, forward patrols reported that the garrison at Bir el Abd was retiring. The mounted force followed the Austrians, Germans and Ottomans as far as Salmana, where another rearguard action delayed the mounted force, as the enemy withdrawal continued back to El Arish.

The Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s lines of communication were now fully extended, and the difficulties of supplying the mounted troops from Romani made it impossible for the British Empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time. Arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements, from Katia eastwards to Bir El Abd.

Von Kressenstein succeeded in withdrawing his battered force from a potentially fatal situation; both his advance to Romani and the withdrawal were remarkable achievements of planning, leadership, staff work and endurance.

=== Casualties ===
According to the Australian official medical history, the total British Empire casualties were:
Other sources put the total killed at 202, with all casualties at 1,130, of whom 900 were from the Anzac Mounted Division.

Ottoman Army casualties have been estimated to have been 9,000; 1,250 were buried after the battle and 4,000 were taken prisoner.

Casualties were cared for by medical officers, stretcher bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve the suffering of the wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.

In the absence of orders coordinating evacuation from the field ambulances, the assistant director of Medical Services (ADMS) made their own arrangements. The ADMS, Anzac Mounted Division arranged with his counterparts in the two infantry divisions to set up a clearing station at the railhead beyond Romani. This station was formed from medical units of the Anzac Mounted, the 42nd and the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions. With no orders from No. 3 Section Headquarters as to the method of evacuation of casualties of the three divisions, prisoners of war were transported back to Kantara by train before the wounded, generating amongst all ranks a feeling of resentment and distrust towards the higher command which lasted for a long time.

== Aftermath ==
The Battle of Romani was the first large-scale mounted and infantry victory by the British Empire in the First World War. It occurred at a time when the Allied nations had experienced nothing but defeat, in France, at Salonika and at the capitulation of Kut in Mesopotamia. The battle has been widely acknowledged as a strategic victory and a turning point in the campaign to restore Egypt&#x27;s territorial integrity and security, and marked the end of the land campaign against the Suez Canal.

This series of successful British infantry and mounted operations resulted in the complete defeat of the 16,000 to 18,000 strong German, Austrian and Ottoman force, about half of whom were killed or wounded, and nearly 4,000 taken prisoner. Also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns, nine machine guns, a complete camel-pack machine gun company, 2,300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition, two complete field hospitals with all instruments, fittings and drugs, while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at Bir el Abd was destroyed. All the captured arms and equipment were made in Germany, and the camel-pack machine gun company&#x27;s equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare. Many of the rifles were of the latest pattern and made of rustless steel. Murray estimated the total German and Ottoman casualties at about 9,000, while a German estimate put the loss at one third of the force (5,500 to 6,000), which seems low considering the number of prisoners.

The tactics employed by the Anzac Mounted Division were to prove effective throughout the coming campaigns in the Sinai and in the Levant (also known at the time as Palestine). The key to the mounted rifles and light horse&#x27;s approach was to quickly move onto tactical ground and then to effectively operate as infantry once dismounted. In defence, the artillery and machine guns wrought havoc on enemy attacks, and during the mounted advance, they covered and supported the British Empire mounted force.

This battle was fought under extreme conditions in the Sinai desert in midsummer heat over many days, causing much suffering to man and beast and demanding tenacity and endurance on the part of all who took part.

The battle of Romani marked the end of the German and Ottoman campaign against the Suez Canal; the offensive had passed decisively into the hands of the British Empire force led by the Anzac Mounted Division. After the battle, von Kressenstein&#x27;s force was pushed back across the Sinai Peninsula, to be beaten at the Battle of Magdhaba in December 1916 and back to the border of Ottoman Empire-controlled Palestine to be defeated at the Battle of Rafa in January 1917, which effectively secured the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. This successful, seven-month-long British Empire campaign, begun at Romani in August, ended at the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917.

=== Some criticisms ===
The Battle of Romani has, however, been surrounded with controversy and criticism. It has been suggested that, like the attack on the Suez Canal in 1915, it was merely a raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal. That the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good motor road beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.

Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel have all been criticised for letting von Kressenstein&#x27;s force escape. Further, it has been asserted that the tactics of the mounted troops actually helped the enemy withdrawal by concentrating on direct assaults rather than flank attacks. The official British historian acknowledges the disappointment caused by the successful retirement of the German, Austrian and Ottoman force but he also notes the quality of the successive rearguard positions constructed during the advance, and the strength, determination and endurance of the enemy. The strength of the rearguards was clearly demonstrated at Bir el Abd on 9 August, when the mounted force attempted to outflank the large entrenched force. They failed because they were greatly outnumbered. Indeed, if the Anzac Mounted Division had succeeded in getting round the flank without infantry support, they would have been faced with vastly superior forces and could have been annihilated.

It has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on 5 August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian, German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia. The infantry&#x27;s difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence&#x27;s confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day&#x27;s battle. General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani. That the strong enemy attack on the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night&#x27;s battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack. Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara, which was considered to be too far from the battlefield, and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day, when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani. Lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on 5 August, when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column.

Chauvel responded by pointing out that the criticisms of the battle were in danger of obscuring the significance of the victory.

=== Awards ===
Murray lavished praise on the Anzac Mounted Division in cables to the Governors General of Australia and New Zealand and in his official despatch and in letters to Robertson, writing:

Every day they show what an indispensable part of my forces they are ... I cannot speak too highly of the gallantry, steadfastness and untiring energy shown by this fine division throughout the operations ... These Anzac troops are the keystone of the defence of Egypt.

But he failed to ensure the fighting qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours. Further, despite claims that Chauvel alone had a clear view of the battle, that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory, his name was omitted from the long list of honours published on New Year&#x27;s Day 1917. Murray did offer Chauvel a lesser award (a Distinguished Service Order) for Romani which he declined.

On reading Murray&#x27;s description in his official despatch covering the battle, and reprinted in a Paris edition of the &#x27;Daily Mail&#x27;, Chauvel wrote to his wife on 3 December 1916,

I am afraid my men will be very angry when they see it. I cannot understand why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much and the whole thing is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.

It was not until after the victory at the Battle of Rafa that Chauvel was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, but this particular order is awarded for important non-military service in a foreign country. It was not just his military service at Romani which had not been recognised, but also the service of all those who fought in the Anzac Mounted Division at Romani, at El Arish, at Magdhaba and at Rafa. In September 1917, not long after General Edmund Allenby became Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Chauvel wrote to GHQ to point out the injustice done to his front-line troops, acknowledging that it was &quot;difficult to do anything now to right this, but consider the Commander-in-Chief should know that there is a great deal of bitterness over it.&quot;

<text>Fried clams are clams dipped in milk, floured, and deep-fried.

Fried clams are an iconic food, &quot;to New England, what barbecue is to the South&quot;. They tend to be served at seaside clam shacks (roadside restaurants). Clam rolls are fried clams served in a New England–style hot dog bun. They are usually served with Tartar sauce.

==Preparation==
The clams are dipped in evaporated milk, then coated with some combination of regular, corn, and pastry flour. The coated clams are fried in canola oil, soybean oil, or lard.

The usual variant in New England is made from whole soft-shell clams, known as &quot;whole-bellies&quot;; these include the clam&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract and have a fuller flavor. Some restaurants remove the clam&#x27;s chewy siphon called the neck.

Outside New England, clam strips, made of sliced Atlantic surf clams, are more common.

==History==
Fried clams are mentioned as early as 1840, and are listed on an 1865 menu from the Parker House hotel. How exactly they were prepared is unclear; the 1865 menu offers both &quot;oysters—fried&quot; and &quot;oysters—fried in batter&quot;, but only &quot;fried clams&quot;.

Nineteenth-century American cookbooks describe several different dishes of fried clams:

* Seasoned clams sautéed in butter. (1850)
* Clams breaded (with egg binding) and sautéed in butter or fat. (1850) (1904)
* Clams in a beaten egg batter, fried in butter, called &quot;clam fritters&quot;. (1850) (1904)

The modern deep-fried, breaded version is generally credited to Lawrence &quot;Chubby&quot; Woodman from Essex, Massachusetts. He is said to have created the first batch on July 3, 1916, in his small roadside restaurant, now Woodman&#x27;s of Essex. One of his specialties was potato chips, so he had large vats for deep-frying. He used clams he had collected himself from the mud flats of the Essex River, located close to his home.

Later, Thomas Soffron, of Soffron Brothers Clam Co., based in Ipswich, Massachusetts, created clam strips, which are made from the &quot;foot&quot; of hard-shelled sea clams. He sold these to Howard Johnson&#x27;s in an exclusive deal, and as the chain expanded, they became popular throughout the country.

==Health and dietary considerations==
Clams in themselves are low in cholesterol and fat, but fried clams absorb cooking fat.

<text>Waddesdon is a closed station that served the village of Waddesdon and its manor, to the north of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. The station is not to be confused with Waddesdon Road railway station at the other end of the Waddesdon Manor estate on the Brill Tramway.

==History==
The station was first opened as Waddesdon Manor by the Metropolitan Railway on 1 January 1897. &quot;Manor&quot; was dropped from the name on 1 October 1922.
It was the first station north of Aylesbury on the section of the Metropolitan Railway between Aylesbury and .

The Metropolitan Railway amalgamated with several other transport companies to form the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. The station was closed on 6 July 1936 when their services were curtailed at Aylesbury.

While open, the station was also served by former Great Central Main Line (running on the same tracks as the Metropolitan line as far as Quainton Road) which was not itself closed to passengers until 1966, under the Beeching Axe.

Today one platform of the station (on the side remote from the remaining track) remains; the other has been demolished. Until 2021 the line was used for a daily freight train carrying waste from London to Calvert, as well as special services between Aylesbury and Quainton Road for events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.

Because of its association with the Metropolitan line this station is considered to be one of the Closed London Underground stations although it is from London and is not underground.

<text>Chivery is a hamlet located in the Chiltern Hills in the present-day parish of Aston Clinton, in Aylesbury Vale District in the county of Buckinghamshire, England. Chivery&#x27;s southern boundary is formed by the ancient earthworks known as Grim&#x27;s Ditch. To the north it is bounded by Wendover Woods.
==History==
Historically, Chivery was part of the manor of Aston Clinton. The manor of Aston Chiverey was created at the end of the 12th century by William de Clinton as a dowry for his daughter Alice, who married Reginald de Mohun. On his death in 1213, Alice married Robert de Beauchamp. From 1250 until around 1380 the manor was held by the Audley family until through marriage it passed to John Rose, an esquire of Richard II of England. By 1410, during Henry IV&#x27;s reign, it had passed to the Crown before being recovered by John Rose&#x27;s descendant Thomas St Clair. Thomas&#x27; lands were divided on his death in 1483 and his daughter Eleanor inherited the manor of Aston Chiverey; through marriage the land became part of the estates of John Gage. His grandson Sir John Gage sold the manor to Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, in 1534, whereon it became recombined with the manor of Aston Clinton once more. The Countess was executed on Henry VIII&#x27;s orders in 1541 and all her lands were forfeit and split up. Ownership of the manor resided with William Batchelor until 1555 when the properties passed in his will to his brother-in-law Thomas Gewat. However, by 1582 the fields were being farmed by Silvester and John Baldwin and the woodlands by another John Gage.

By this time also the manor had become part of the St Leonards parish, which had split from Aston Clinton. During the 19th century Chivery became part of a new parish of Aston Clinton St Leonards. In 1934 Chivery was hived off from St Leonards, which was combined with other parishes to become Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards parish within Amersham Rural District, while Chivery became part of Aston Clinton parish, also in Aylesbury Rural District.

From 1776 Chivery had a pub, The Plough, which survived into the 20th century and became a restaurant before finally closing in the 1930s.

<doc id="401926" wikidata="Q937737" url="?curid=401926" title="Moxibustion">
<text>Moxibustion () is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy which consists of burning dried mugwort (&quot;&quot;) on particular points on the body. It plays an important role in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. Suppliers usually age the mugwort and grind it up to a fluff; practitioners burn the fluff or process it further into a cigar-shaped stick. They can use it indirectly, with acupuncture needles, or burn it on the patient&#x27;s skin.

Moxibustion is promoted as a treatment for a wide variety of conditions, but its use is not backed by good evidence and it carries a risk of adverse effects.

== Terminology ==
The first Western remarks on moxibustion can be found in letters and reports written by Portuguese missionaries in 16th-century Japan. They called it &quot;botão de fogo&quot; (), a term originally used for round-headed Western cautery irons. Hermann Buschoff, who published the first Western book on this matter in 1674 (English edition 1676), used the Japanese pronunciation &quot;mogusa&quot; (from &quot;moe-gusa&quot;, lit. burning herb). As the &quot;u&quot; is not very strongly enunciated, he spelled it &quot;Moxa&quot;. Later authors blended &quot;Moxa&quot; with the Latin word &quot;combustio&quot; (&quot;burning&quot;).

The name of the herb Artemisia (mugwort) species used to produce Moxa is called &quot;ài&quot; or &quot;àicǎo&quot; (, ) in Chinese and &quot;yomogi&quot; () in Japan.
The Chinese names for moxibustion are &quot;jiǔ&quot; () or &quot;jiǔshù&quot; (); the Japanese use the same characters and pronounce them as &quot;kyū&quot; and &quot;kyūjutsu&quot;. In Korean the reading is &quot;tteum&quot; (). Korean folklore attributes the development of moxibustion to the legendary emperor Dangun.

== Theory and practice ==
Practitioners use moxa to warm regions and meridian points with the intention of stimulating circulation through the points and inducing a smoother flow of blood and qi. Some believe it can treat conditions associated with the &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;yang deficiencies&quot; in Chinese medicine. It is claimed that moxibustion mitigates against cold and dampness in the body, and can be used to treat lymphedema following intrapelvic lymph node dissection, and help turn breech babies.

Practitioners claim moxibustion to be especially effective in the treatment of chronic problems, &quot;deficient conditions&quot; (weakness), and gerontology. Bian Que (&quot;fl.&quot; &quot;circa&quot; 500 BCE), one of the most famous semi-legendary doctors of Chinese antiquity and the first specialist in moxibustion, discussed the benefits of moxa over acupuncture in his classic work &quot;Bian Que Neijing&quot;. He asserted that moxa could add new energy to the body and could treat both excess and deficient conditions.

Practitioners may use acupuncture needles made of various materials in combination with moxa, depending on the direction of &quot;qi&quot; flow they wish to stimulate.

There are several methods of moxibustion. Three of them are direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and indirect moxibustion. Direct scarring moxibustion places a small cone of moxa on the skin at an acupuncture point and burns it until the skin blisters, which then scars after it heals. Direct non-scarring moxibustion removes the burning moxa before the skin burns enough to scar, unless the burning moxa is left on the skin too long. Indirect moxibustion holds a cigar made of moxa near the acupuncture point to heat the skin, or holds it on an acupuncture needle inserted in the skin to heat the needle. There is also stick-on moxa.

&quot;Chuanwu lingji lu&quot; (the Record of Sovereign Teachings), by Zhang Youheng, was a treatise on acu-moxa completed in 1869 and featuring several colour illustrations of the points on the body where moxa could be applied to treat the complaint.
== Uses and effectiveness ==

Most research into moxibustion comes from China and is generally of low quality. Claims are made for its effectiveness for a wide variety of conditions, with some practitioners promoting it as a panacea.

=== Pregnancy ===
There is some evidence to suggest that moxibustion, when included along with other procedures that are usual to care for a person who is at risk of a breech birth, may decrease the chances that the baby presents in the breech position and may decrease the chances of a person requiring oxytocin to help labour start or progress. This evidence is considered to be of the &quot;moderate&quot; level of certainty by a 2023 Cochrane Systematic Review, however, the safety profile was not clear in these studies as adverse effects were not well considered or properly reported. In addition, the need or role of turning the baby by performing an external cephalic version to prevent a breech birth along with these treatments is not known. There is no evidence that moxibustion, when combined with standard care practices, helps reduce the risk of a person requiring a caesarean section. It is also not clear if there are any benefits for preventing early membrane ruptures or a protective effect on the umbilical cord blood pH level.

=== Other ===
Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain, cancer, stroke, ulcerative colitis, constipation, and hypertension. Systematic reviews have found that these studies are of low quality and positive findings could be due to publication bias.

== Adverse effects ==
Moxibustion carries a risk of adverse effects including burns and infection. Some side effects that have been reported include nausea, throat irritation, and abdominal pain from contractions when used in pregnancy. 

== Parallel uses of mugwort ==
Mugwort amongst other herbs was often bound into smudge sticks. The Chumash people from southern California have a similar ritual. Europeans placed sprigs of mugwort under pillows to provoke dreams; and the herb had associations with the practice of magic in Anglo-Saxon times.

<text>The Abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes was a monastery of Augustinian canons in Soissons, France, southwest of the old town. Only ruins remain, of which the west front of the former abbey church is one of the more outstanding examples of architecture in the town. It is a listed historic monument.

==History==
The abbey was founded on the Colline Saint-Jean (St. John&#x27;s hill) in 1076 by Hugues Le Blanc as a community of Augustinian canons.

Initially built in Romanesque style, the initial buildings were replaced at the end of the 12th century by those extant today. The west front was begun in the 12th century, but not finished until the 16th. The refectory and cellar date from the 13th century, parts of the cloisters from the end of the 13th century, while other parts are from the 16th century, as is the abbot&#x27;s lodging.

When the abbey was suppressed during the French Revolution the premises were put to use for military purposes, and an arsenal was added.

The site was acquired by the town of Soissons in the 1970s and the remaining buildings are now occupied by educational and heritage-related organizations.

<doc id="401929" wikidata="Q3079750" url="?curid=401929" title="Maghazi refugee camp">
<text>Maghazi () is a Palestinian refugee camp located in the Deir al-Balah Governorate in the central Gaza Strip. It was established in 1949. The camp is built on 559 dunums (0.6 km2). In July 2023, the UNRWA reported its population to be 33,000. During the first months of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, its population tripled and faced repeated airstrikes by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

== History ==
In early 1949 Quaker aid workers visited Maghazi and reported that there were 2,500 refugees camped on privately owned land. They were living in Bedouin and Egyptian army tents as well the British army barracks. Most of the refugees had come from eight villages including Yasur, Qastina, Al-Batani al-Sharqi, Al-Batani al-Gharbi and Al-Maghar.

== Population ==
According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the camp had a population of 18,157 in 2017 and the surrounding Maghazi municipality had a population of 9,670. In July 2023, the United Nations agency UNRWA reported that its population was 33,000.

During the 2023 war, population surged to 100,000 as the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ordered Gaza residents to flee to the south.

== Income ==
Before the Gaza Strip&#x27;s closure to Israel in 2000 following the Al-Aqsa Intifada, most residents had taken a number of various jobs in Israel or worked as farmers at local tells and pastures. There is a weekly souk, or open-air market, on Sunday in which residents buy or sell goods from their workshops, bakeries, cafes, diners and grocery lots.

As of 2023 there were around 30 municipality workers.

== Education ==
Maghazi has three elementary schools and 2 junior high schools run by the UNRWA. 6,407 pupils had enrolled at these schools in the 2004-2005 year. In 1998, the UNRWA provided integrated educational services to 1,264 children with disabilities. There are a number of youth activities that involve in athletics, social and cultural programs.

One UNRWA school was bombed by the IDF in 2023. Another two were used to house around 25,000 displaced Palestinians during the 2023 war.

==Raids and warfare==

On the evening of Monday 6 January 2003, the IDF raided the camp, killed three Palestinians and wounded dozens, saying they were targeting militants hiding there.

In 2023, the camp was struck by Israeli airstrikes on 17 October, 5 November, 6 December and 24 December. Bombing destroyed the only bakery in the camp. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the 5 November airstrikes killed 50 people and the 24 December airstrikes killed 70 people. Refugees in the camp faced disease epidemics, blockades preventing the import of food, water and sanitary products, and blocked access to landfill sites. Two of its seven wells were bombed, while the others were inoperable as fuel could not be imported.

On August 7, 2024 an Israeli raid on the camp killed two people, and injured dozens.

<text>On March 18, 1925, one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in recorded history generated at least 12 significant tornadoes and spanned a large portion of the midwestern and southern United States. In all, at least 751 men, women and children were killed and more than 2,298 were injured, making the outbreak the deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The outbreak generated several destructive tornadoes in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on the same day, as well as significant tornadoes in Alabama and Kansas. In addition to confirmed tornadoes, there were undoubtedly others with lesser impacts, the occurrences of which have been lost to history.

The outbreak included the Tri-State Tornado, the deadliest disaster in Illinois, the deadliest tornado in U.S. history, and the second-deadliest registered in world history. The track left by the tornado, as it crossed from southeastern Missouri, through southern Illinois, and then into southwestern Indiana, is also the longest ever recorded. Modern meteorological re-analysis has suggested that the extremely long path length and lifespan reported in historical accounts are perhaps more plausibly attributed to multiple independent tornadoes belonging to a tornado family, rather than a single, continuous tornado. Although not officially rated by NOAA, the Tri-State Tornado is recognized by most experts (such as Tom Grazulis and Ted Fujita) as an F5 tornado, the maximum damage rating issued on the Fujita scale.

==Background==

During a six-year review study of the Tri-State tornado published in 2013, new surface and upper air data was obtained and meteorological reanalysis was utilized, adding significantly to knowledge of the synoptic and even mesoscale background of the event. The late winter to early spring of 1925 was warmer and drier than normal over much of the central United States. There apparently was persistent ridging in the western U.S. with a troughing pattern over the central U.S.

The extratropical cyclone that set the synoptic stage for the outbreak was centered over northwestern Montana at 7:00 a.m. CST (13:00 UTC) on March 17. Meanwhile, a diffuse area of surface low pressure was centered near Denver, Colorado, in association with a lee trough. Occluded fronts extended from Hudson Bay southwestward into the northern Plains states and into the lee trough. The synoptic cyclone moved south-southeastward across the mountain states to eastern Colorado. A warm front stretched along the Gulf Coast, separating warm, moist air from cool, showery weather with areas of fog that extended from Texas to the Carolinas. A well-mixed early-season continental tropical (cT) air mass existed over West Texas and northern New Mexico. To the east of this hot, dry air, buoyant maritime tropical (mT) air was advecting from the Gulf of Mexico. Simultaneously, a mid- to upper-level shortwave trough likely approached the northwest coast of the U.S. and moved rapidly through the persistent ridge then digging southeastward across the Great Basin and central Rocky Mountains and emerging in the Plains over Colorado. This initiated a &quot;Colorado low&quot; cyclogenesis.

At 7:00 a.m. CST on March 18, the surface low-pressure area, at approximately , moved to far northeastern Oklahoma while the warm front shot north into the circulation where the front then extended eastward. A maritime Polar (mP) cold front draped southwestward across eastern Texas with a dry line forming directly to the south of the low. The open shortwave, likely somewhat negatively tilted, was continuing to approach from the northwest and an apparent outflow boundary moved just to the south of the warm front over northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee. Several weak pressure troughs were traversing the cool sector over the north-central U.S.. Surface temperatures in the warm sector near the dry line and warm front ranged from , and the dew point was , with higher values farther south and increasing over time as the deepening low-pressure area continued to pull up air from the Gulf of Mexico. https://www.weather.gov/pah/1925Tornado_wi#:~:text=In This resulted in unstable air and lower cloud bases, or low LCL heights, which is favorable to tornadogenesis. From southeastern Kansas to Kentucky and Indiana, early morning showers and thunderstorms north of the low and warm front cooled and stabilized that air, retarding northward advancement of the front, and led to a sharp contrast in temperature from north to south. Such baroclinic zones are also associated with tornadic storms. Ahead of the surface dry line, which are uncommon as far east as the Mississippi River, an apparent &quot;dry punch&quot; of air aloft served to further increase instability. Concurrently, a capping inversion likely suppressed storms throughout the warm sector, leaving the Tri-State supercell undisturbed by nearby convection.

By 12:00 p.m. CST (18:00 UTC), the deepening surface low was centered over south-central Missouri, the shortwave axis was moving easterly and oriented over eastern Oklahoma, and the dry line was rapidly advancing eastward directly south of the low as the warm front, situated due east of the low, slowly shifted northward. Morning clouds cleared by midday across much of the Tri-State tornado&#x27;s eventual path. A pronounced pressure trough extended northeast of the low and signaled its future track as a prefrontal trough formed southeast of the low ahead of the dry line. A bulge in the dry line may also have been forming slightly south of the low, and southerly to southeasterly surface winds were backing and increasing with time throughout the warm sector. The Tri-State supercell formed in a highly favorable area just ahead of the triple point where the cold front, warm front, and dry line met. The supercell initiated very near the surface low and moved east-northeastward, faster than the low, such that the storm gradually deviated east of the low&#x27;s track. The supercell remained near this &quot;sweet spot&quot; for a prolonged period as it also traveled near the highly baroclinic warm front (likely just across the cool side of the boundary) for several hours.
By 2:00 p.m. CST (20:00 UTC), the low was centered slightly south-southwest of St. Louis, Missouri, as the Tri-State supercell neared the Mississippi River. Other storms in the warm sector, removed from the Tri-State supercell, were initiating around 3:00 p.m. CST (21:00 UTC). Around 4:00 p.m. CST (22:00 UTC), the low&#x27;s central pressure lowered to around , centered over south-central Illinois, as the supercell was moving into Indiana. This pressure is not particularly low compared to many other outbreak setups, but the pressure gradient was strong, which induced strong gradient winds and significant advection in the warm sector. A very strong low level jet was also in place just above the surface as winds veered with height, resulting in low-level curvature and long hodographs. Strong wind shear thus existed, with pronounced directional shear likely in the vicinity of the warm front, with winds at the 700 hPa height level west-southwesterly around and winds at the 500 hPa level about . Theoretical hodographs returned estimated storm relative environmental helicity (SREH) values of 340 m2 s−2 in the vicinity of the Tri-State supercell track. Strong thunderstorms were now scattered throughout the warm sector and a line of severe thunderstorms was occurring near the dry line. The Tri-State supercell appeared to still be discrete and isolated, with a severe storm north of Cairo, Illinois, placed well to its south.

By 6:00 p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), the shortwave axis was over eastern Missouri and was lifting northeast. At 7:00 p.m. CST (01:00 UTC), the low was placed near Indianapolis, Indiana, with numerous thunderstorms east and south of the low and a squall line moving into the southeastern U.S. Cold air advection behind the strong cold front fed into the cyclone as snow and sleet fell from eastern Iowa to central Michigan. At 7:00 a.m. CST on March 19, the low was deepening and lifting rapidly northeastward into Canada.

==Confirmed tornadoes==
These are estimated tornado ratings as tornado ratings in the United States were not official until 1950.


===Tri-State tornado===
The tornado, sometimes referred to as the Great tri-state tornado, touched down around 1.00 pm in Shannon County, Missouri, moving to the northeast. The tornado immediately began to produce heavy damage to structures before directly impacting Annapolis, destroying ninety percent of the town and killing two people. The tornado then moved through Bollinger County, where it would hit two schools and injure several children who were taking shelter. Deep ground scouring was observed as the tornado moved past Sedgewickville, and debris from the town was found almost away. It would hit several other small communities, including Brazeau and Frohna, before crossing state lines into Southern Illinois and directly impacting Gorham. Over half of the town&#x27;s population was killed, and the town was devastated as the tornado moved by. To the northeast, it would hit the northern portions of Murphysboro, where over one hundred residents would die as the tornado barelled through the town at an estimated forward speed of .

Further east, the tornado crossed into Franklin County, narrowly missing the towns of Royalton and Zeigler, devastating rural areas before heading towards the large mining town of West Frankfort. The tornado struck the northwest side of town, where in a manner similar to what was seen at Murphysboro, a number of densely populated neighborhoods, businesses and mining operations fell victim to the tornado. At the Peabody Mine 18 in Caldwell, a large 80-foot coal tipple weighing several hundred tons was blown over and rolled by the tornado. The tornado proceeded to devastate additional rural areas across Hamilton and White counties, between the two counties claiming 45 lives and injuring 140, 20 of whom later died, where it dissipated over three hours after touching down.

The tornado killed at least twenty farm owners in southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana, more than the combined total of the next four deadliest tornadoes in the history of the United States. The tornado killed a combined total of 695 people, the majority of which occurred in Illinois. Despite not being officially rated, it is widely accepted to have been equivalent to an F5 on the Fujita scale, with winds up to . There has long been uncertainty as to whether the originally recognized reports of a path over 3.5 hours represent a single continuous tornado or multiple independently tracking tornadoes belonging to a tornado family. Because of the scarcity of verifiable meteorological data from the time of the event and the apparent absence of any record of a tornado having approached this path length and duration in the years since, doubts have been raised about the plausibility of the conclusion that a single tornado was responsible for them. To date no definitive conclusion has been reached and a complete understanding of what occurred remains unachieved.

==Non-tornadic effects==
Strong thunderstorms were reported in a broad area that also included parts of Oklahoma, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ontario. Numerous reports of hail and straight-line winds were reported, with up to hail recorded (by comparison, a softball is in diameter). What began in the early afternoon as discrete supercell thunderstorms eventually consolidated into a potent squall line. By all accounts it was a widespread outbreak with severe thunderstorms occurring as far east as Ohio, as far southwest as Louisiana, and as far southeast as Georgia.

The school is located on Second Street, across the street from City Hall and the Police Department, bounded by Second Street, Commonwealth Avenue, Fifth Street, and Main Street. The campus is divided into three parts, by Third and Fourth Streets.

Alhambra High School has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges—for the first time in 1965 and most recently in 2024, for a fixed term after each evaluation.

==Present==
As of January 2015, enrollment at AHS is about 2,700 students, In this ethnically-mixed school district, the high school is one of the three comprehensive high schools. Curriculum offerings encompass Reading for remedial instruction, to Advanced Placement courses in six subjects, including English composition, calculus, environmental science, physics, American government, United States history, world history, art history, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Psychology.

==History==
Around 1884, Alhambra citizens saw the need for their own school.

On October 11, 2006, a small explosive device was found on a sidewalk bordering the north end of campus. Hours later, a second similar device was found in a trash can on the south end of campus. The Los Angeles County sheriff&#x27;s bomb squad safely removed and disabled both items, and the campus was searched.

In early 2007, the school was featured on the third season of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. 100 members from the senior class of 2007 were invited to participate. Each chef had to prepare 100 portions of a dish for each of the students. It was one of a select few public high schools in California to be awarded a distinguished Great Schools Rating of 8 out of 10.

==Music==
The marching band was selected to march in the 2009 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade, the first time a band from Alhambra has been in the parade in 40 years. In 2020, they performed again in the Rose Parade, as part of a band including members from Mark Keppel High School and San Gabriel High School.

==Controversy==
In April 2005, an article was published by &quot;The Moor&quot;, the school&#x27;s biweekly newspaper, titled &quot;Latinos Lag Behind in Academics&quot;. It discussed that Hispanic students&#x27; test scores have improved, then asked why Asian scores were noticeably higher, postulating that Asian students worked harder in academics than Hispanic students, suggesting the latter were &quot;not pulling their weight&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; discussed the achievement gap in context, noting the outrage and charges of racism towards the student author and the Latino pride response.
